        "selftext": "I am in no way shape or form blaming my bf, but I think I mentally scarred myself. I\u2019ve been watching some pretty crazy shit recently, and I had the smart idea to try something out. I asked him if he could preform certain acts of BDSM with my consent. I wasn\u2019t abused as a kid or anything. Idk, porn just glorified it enough to make me curious. We had safe words and everything. And when we did the deed, I was\u2026 conflicted to say the least. It was arousing, don\u2019t get me wrong. But fuck, it also left me feeling helpless. I know it was kind of the point, but I was not prepared. I didn\u2019t ask to stop because I was still getting off on it.\n\nMy bf was very against it at first since he was as vanilla as a person can be. but he said if I really wanted to try, he\u2019d be up for it. The thing was, he actually enjoyed it. Like really enjoyed it. \n\nAnyways afterwards, I let him know that it wasn\u2019t as fun as I\u2019d thought it would be and that we wouldn\u2019t do it again. He was understanding of course. But for some reason, I was kind of unnerved that he was really into it. And the weeks afterwards, I just kept thinking of how helpless. I\u2019ve been less intimate with my boyfriend since then. Every time he touches me to initiate, I recoil. And every time I think of being intimate with him, I think of that night.\n\nMy boyfriend has been very supportive with me, saying it\u2019s no big deal if we weren\u2019t intimate. Just as long as I feel comfortable. The thing is, I\u2019m not. He doesn\u2019t know that this has been festering inside me and I actually feel like shit for feeling like this. It seems totally unfair to tell him about this because, like I literally asked for bdsm specifically! He\u2019d feel like a total piece of shit for doing what I asked. It\u2019s not his fault I woke some kink in him. \n\nAnyways, I think I\u2019m gonna spend money on therapy to fix this myself, thanks for listening Reddit\n\nTLDR: Asked my bf to be very rough with me during sex. It mentally scarred me and I feel like shit for feeling like shit. Can\u2019t tell my bf because it\u2019ll make him feel like shit because I\u2019m a piece of shit for thinking it would be hot. So I\u2019m going to therapy.\n\nEdit: Hi! Shit. Didn\u2019t expect this to blow up as big as it did. There is no way I\u2019ll be able to read every comment, but I want to thank all of you! Even the \u201cquestionable\u201d comments for the laughs. I just want to reiterate that I don\u2019t blame my boyfriend at all. In fact I\u2019m going to just up and tell him my feelings and apologize for being somewhat cold these last few weeks. We\u2019re generally pretty good about communicating since we\u2019ve been together for years. But idk, there\u2019s something deeply personal about opening up about this. Like I know it\u2019s hypocritical to be upset. But I can\u2019t just turn off my anxiety. And I know he\u2019s anxious about it too, but doesn\u2019t want to open up either in fear of hurting my feelings too. That\u2019s why I\u2019ll just rip off the band aid. Anyways thanks again Reddit! And also sorting by controversial gave me some good laughs just from the insanity of a certain group of people lmao. I hope you guys find someone that loves you.\n\nEdit 2: I let him in on the inner workings of my mind the other day. I made it very clear that I am not voluntarily trying to hold it against it. Rather it the result of some trauma that I brought upon myself for my lack of preparation. I apologized for being relatively cold for the last weeks, and we made it. He knew something was up and felt really bad, and I reassured it it was all on me. I showed him the Reddit post just for transparency. Anyways, we\u2019re both gonna go to therapy to deal with any trauma induced symptoms. Because that\u2019s what it is, symptoms that I want to get treated. It isn\u2019t me, nor do I want to be dictated by it. Anyways, have a lovely day peeps! And to all the people at the top of controversial sort, I mean it. I hope you find someone that will love you \u2764\ufe0f",

A night of listening to each others commands gently and intimately, guiding each other to positive orgasm, and having an intimate sexual experience that is slow and methodical. Do something intimate together, like a long date of whatever you like, and then communicate and gently dictate during sex to please and stimulate each other, together.\n\nEdit: Just wanted to mention, *when you're ready.

You need to have a proper discussion the first time doing this, and anytime you do this with a new person.

Porn is poison for the inexperienced. A good example being anal. You can't just barrel into some woman's asshole, and jackhammer the fuck out of it and expect her to love every second of it. Yet many dudes think that's how it works, and do just that, and then wonder why their GF is in pain, and never wants to do it again.\n\nYou really need to sit down with your BF, and discuss the whole situation. As someone else said, he was only enjoying himself, because he preceived you to be enjoying it. Have the discussion with him, this is part of being in a relationship, and regardless as to how wild, or bland your sex life may be, you need to be open to each about these things, boundries need to be set, and likes and dislikes need to be known.",

            "Another TIFU that can completely fixed by simple communication",
            "Hi OP. Thanks for sharing your experience. I hope it helped a bit to talk about it. I have some thoughts if you\u2019re interested. For what it\u2019s worth, some mental health science for peace of mind:  - [the myth that bdsm is linked to childhood trauma is being dismissed by modern research.](https://bigthink.com/neuropsych/bdsm-psychology-trauma/). Additionally, researchers are finding that [there\u2019s no evidence that BDSM practitioners have a higher degree of psychopathology compared to the general population.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jsm.12192). No one can blame you for wondering how this may relate to your mental health. This is an outdated idea that dates back to Freud and psychology\u2019s Stone Age, but it\u2019s an idea that has stuck around in society.\n\nFirst, you\u2019re doing the exact right thing \u2014 processing your experience, reflecting, and learning about yourself. That\u2019s a good thing. Processing this way puts you in the best position to be empowered and make decisions that align with your values. I\u2019m sorry that it\u2019s uncomfortable in the meantime. I know that\u2019s a shitty place to be. As others have said, talking to your boyfriend and taking it slow - listening to each other\u2019s experience without judgement - could be something that brings you closer together. If feelings get turbulent in this conversation, which is normal and happens sometimes, agree to both hit \u201cpause\u201d and trust one another to revisit it later when you\u2019re both ready to continue. \n\nSecond, BDSM heightens sensory and emotional experiences, and in the case of role play, it can facilitate a different state of consciousness that can be intensely arousing (as you experienced) and also emotionally flooding (as you are currently experiencing). There are a few reasons for this:\n\n1) a healthy BDSM arrangement empowers both the submissive and dominant to consensually relax some of their inhibitions and enjoy things in private that they may otherwise never share with anyone else. This can be intensely vulnerable, because you are both sharing a part of yourself that you otherwise keep hidden, and you may have conflicted feelings about what this part of yourself means. \n\n2) A heightened experience sometimes needs a soft landing. This is why aftercare is so important - or time spent \u201ccoming back\u201d to your partner. It\u2019s the time where you hold space for one another. Some people cuddle, some people like to talk about it as if it were a movie they watched together, some people cry and are held. The value here is in reinforcing the secure attachment bond between you two. It\u2019s the expression, physically and/or verbally, of \u201cI\u2019m here. I see you. I love you. I love your needs, and they are not too much.\u201d\n\nLastly, your emotions around feeling unnerved are protecting you \u2014 they are saying, \u201cHey, is this safe? Am I okay?\u201d  Trust those emotions. They keep you safe and are just doing a solid safety check. If this is something you truly enjoy with your partner, those emotions will find calm by taking your time and talking things out together  - whether you continue BDSM or not. Your closeness and experience is what matters whether you\u2019re practicing vanilla or playing with one another\u2019s fantasies.",
            "After care is important. You must talk about this with him. Also he enjoyed it yes but he thought you was enjoying it, I doubt he would of been if he knew how you felt.",
            "Just tell him. The exact same thing happened with my girlfriend a few years back, she said that it wasn\u2019t as expected and she didn\u2019t like it that rough so we never did it again. Don\u2019t wait too long, just tell him how you feel",
            "(Soft as a bag of kittens) Dom here. \n\nBDSM isn\u2019t a swimming pool you just run and cannonball into.

            "Don't hide your feelings from him. BDSM is completely communication based, hence the importance of safe words, aftercare, hard and soft limits, etc.\n\nYou need to be honest about how you're feeling right now with your boyfriend. And if you still feel you need to go to therapy, do it. I never say turn down therapy... but just don't exclude your boyfriend. \n\nOne thing I've learned in my failed relationships is that I used to have the conversations that were meant for them, by myself. I \"knew\" what they would say, I \"knew\" how they would feel. Truth is, I DIDN'T give them the freedom to feel or say what they were going to... \n\nTL;DR: you're NOT a psychic, stop hiding your feelings to \"protect\" your boyfriend's. Yes, get therapy, but be honest. Keep your communication lines open. \n\u2010------\u2010-------\n\nAlso... Some of the people here are mental asf... like, shut up.. \ud83d\ude12",
            "It's not too late to do some aftercare. Communicate this to him and tell him that you need lots of gentle non-sexual touch. Reform the physical bond through safe affection and quality time. Once the comfort level starts to go back up you can also use some soft romantic intimacy to progress it further. Your body remembers the roughness and it's reacting accordingly. You need to replace that memory. That's why BDSM is always followed by aftercare. It brings the sub down slowly and under the direct care of the person who just hurt them. They're vulnerable and exposed and it's important to get the trust back during that time.  \n\n\nBDSM shouldn't be taken lightly without some research. The pain and panic triggers physical changes in the brain and floods chemicals in amounts you're not used to. Afterwards, the withdrawal from those high levels will trigger other physical responses. It's called drop and it can be hard to go through alone.",

            "Communication is the best lubrication, definitely consider talking to you BF about it directly, and explain how you feel.  When involved in heavy BDSM play you may need that cool down/after care  experience of cuddling, it's important.   \n\nBDSM Aftercare tips : https://www.menshealth.com/sex-women/a29341534/sexual-aftercare/",
            "Ok, so two things:\n\nAn extremely important part of BDSM play is aftercare, but it always seems to be the part that gets overlooked or ignored. People know about things like safe words and consent, but they don't think about cleaning up the mess afterwards. And BDSM is all about making a mess.\n\nWith aftercare, the goal is to make sure that both parties are comfortable, are able to speak about how they felt, are able to discuss if they enjoyed feeling that way, and do so in a non-judgmental and caring manner.\n\nBeing able to properly execute aftercare is an art in and of itself - it takes a ton of emotional maturity to examine how one feels and be honest and vulnerable with their partner about it.\n\nWhat you're experiencing is a classic example of insufficient aftercare. You've tried something new, it gave you a level of anxiety that you didn't anticipate, and now you're not sure how to deal with it without making it seem like you're placing blame or having \"the wrong feelings\". And, the longer you wait, the harder it is to address because it feels like \"you should have been able to move past it by now\".\n\nHere's the thing - until you take the time to sit down with your partner and explain that you need to have a conversation about what happened, and you would like to do it without any judgment or any sort of fear that you're going to \"say the wrong thing.\" He also needs to be relaxed, loving, and able to make his feelings known without any judgment on your part. Aftercare is very much a two-way street, and it can test the foundations of your relationship if you aren't able to hear and say scary things without being afraid of being judged.\n\nSecond, you and your partner need to be able to understand and accept that enjoying something within the context of fantasy is not the same thing as enjoying something outside of the context of fantasy.\n\nIt sounds like you guys were doing some rape play or serious domination bondage. That can make the submissive partner feel very very insecure, and it can make the dominant partner experience a type of power they've never had before - especially if the sexually dominant partner is a relatively passive and caring person in their day-to-day life.\n\nIt's important you understand this - just because you felt scared or overwhelmed, that's not a bad thing. As a matter of fact, if you have proper aftercare in place, it can be a fun and stress relieving thing. Losing yourself in the fantasy world, coming out truly terrified, and then going through an aftercare process where you find yourself back in reality - it will cleanse your soul.\n\nBut again, you can't confuse who you are in the fantasy with who you are in the reality.\n\nAnd, back to point one, the way you prevent that from happening is through aftercare.\n\nJust in case I haven't defined aftercare well enough - it's the process that you and your partner use to separate the darkness, the fear, the power, the rage, the abnormalities of your sexual fantasies from the realities of your kind, loving, forgiving, and joyous daily relationship.\n\nIn most cases, aftercare consist of 30 minutes to an hour of cuddling, talking, questioning each other about how you feel, talking about your fears and your pleasures, etc. It's deeply personal to each couple, and it's dependent on what each member of the partnership needs. It's a very giving process from each partner to the other - making sure their needs are met and they come back to reality with love and compassion.",

I don't think he was 'into the bdsm act in which you were constrained and suffering' - from his point of view he was acting out your sexual fantasy. due to the nature of bdsm it's actually fair that he wouldn't know you weren't enjoying yourself. from his point of view he is enthusiastically going along with what you wanted to do, likely enjoying his nude gf (if nothing else), and possibly enjoying doing something 'out of character'. \n\nI think that you are transposing your feelings about the bdsm with his enjoyment of having sex with you and I'm not sure it's fair to look at it that way. \n\nand furthermore, even if he was really enjoying it and loved it - it still wouldn't be fair to hold it against him that he liked something you didn't like. I think that your intense feelings about the bdsm are clouding your judgment. if you wanted to go to a restaurant and the two of you went and he loved it and you hated it you wouldn't be upset with him; because of course you wouldn't. \n\nlastly, I think you should be kind to yourself about the whole thing. there is nothing wrong at all with sexual curiosity.

            "I think there\u2019s 2 parts to this that largely contribute. Post nut clarity; moreso a lack of aftercare by your dom,which is crucial to the wellbeing of the sub. Honestly it sounds like even during the act he wasn\u2019t very diligent with continuing to check in with you during; which is also a pretty big deal.\n I think y\u2019all need to really talk about this.",

            "Classic case of imagining yourself as someone you\u2019re not and/or fuck around and find out. People have such a hard time being content in perfectly fine situations, and for some reason feel the need to always want more/push the envelope. Dumb dumb dumb.",
            "I hope you see this, OP, but my karma being what it is...\n\nI'm going to go counter to what most people are saying here: Trust your instincts. You saw something you didn't like in how your boyfriend reacted, and that's important.\n\nMy wife and I have been into BDSM for 14 years now. I have a fetish in that space she doesn't, which she tolerates in small doses, but isn't in to. So we're always cognizant of the difference between \"us\" having a good time, and \"me\" having a good time.\n\nEven though you're brand new to this, even though you literally asked for it, even though he's been supportive afterwards and seems happy to give you space... even though all of that is true, what you saw was real. It either was, or really looked like, a \"me having a good time\" moment, which is hard to build trust on top of.\n\nThis is a shameless blind guess, but he may not be as vanilla as you think, but was maybe afraid to talk to you about kink. Find out if that's the case. That might help you process this.\n\nI don't know, maybe my guess is dead wrong. Either way, don't give up on yourself. You'll feel comfortable and safe again. You'll feel adventurous again. And now you know to go a little slower, and to grill your partners more about what they're into.\n\nGood luck, kiddo.",
            "Hopefully you've read up on sub and Dom drop! Its an actual hormonal drop, I personally get the shakes. This sounds like it could be that, or at least is contributing. The prescription is reassurance, tell eachother you love eachother, that you don't want to hurt/scare eachother, what went wrong AND what went right, so you can have a better time next time. Possibly also cuddles if that's what you need. Replenish that oxytocin~ It's a learning experience for the both of you. \n\nAlso random related aside that might resonate with you; I once saw a movie (Short Bus. HIGHLY reccomend) with a character wanting to explore bdsm. he hired a domme to help him figure out what he liked. He didn't want to go right into the deep end, but also didn't know where to even start, so he was hesitant. She told him \"Put your hands on the headboard. If you let go I'll leave.\" ~chefs kiss~ Perfect explanation. The illusion of Loss of Control is a very fine line to walk but when it works it's amazing. I hope you can have a fun experience next time!!",
            "So good news, it is possibly fixable. Requires work, but doable. \n\nDown side, its just possibly. If that instance made you feel differently towards your partner permenantly... thats unfortunate, but also possible. \n\nBiggest thing is sitting down amd talking about it. Let him know how you felt during. How it made you uncomfortable, your idea or not, and the unnerved feeling since. Then let him talk about his perspective on the experience. Keeping this dialogue open is super important so you each know how the other felt about and during the experience. It will help him understand more of whats wrong and how to handle things going forward. \n\nAnother thing is to start slow in resolving it. Simple acts like just holding hands, and go up as comfortable from there. Again, with that open dialogue. You can both decide when to push into more intimate things, what those are, and at a good pace (within everyones comfort) while you discuss it pver time. \n\nI wish you luck. Definately been in similar spots myself and, so far, recovered the relationships that have mattered.",

Its also important to talk about so that he doesnt misunderstanding your own boundary. As difficult as these talks can be to start, they are very important for both sides of a relationship.",
            "You\u2019re probably making him feel worse by not saying anything. If you notice you aren\u2019t as intimate then he will definitely notice since he is a vanilla person. By not saying something he may just be thinking that you don\u2019t want him anymore because of you want someone else who is okay with that type of stuff.

Just talk to him. From what you described, your behavior has changed and he\u2019s noticed. He\u2019s probably scared by that. Don\u2019t punish him for this.",

I open the door to my room and she bolts out and starts cowering in the furthest corner of the apartment from my room. She won't let me near her.\n\nI feel like a villain. I love her more than anything and now she's fearing for her life.\n\nTldr; I brought a stuffed cat toy home for my cat.

But it has those dark little button eyes and I guess that's enough. \n\nWhile showing him the sheep, bf sort of dropped it and just for a second, it moved unpredictably enough for Archer the cat to wholeheartedly believe that sheep was here for his territory (in actuality his sister, Lana, is the true queen) \n\nHe puffed up and went defensive for a bit, we didn't want to scare him more and figured he'd get over it in his own time so I just sat the sheep on our bed - a place we were trying to get him to avoid due to bf's allergies. Thought it might be fun to let him think the bed was the sheep's domain if it kept him off the bed.\n\nAn hour later I checked and there was Archer, up on the bed, facing down the sheep. The sheep handily beat Archer at repeated staring contests and he lost more and more of his nerve. After about 30 minutes of this (now I'm just checking reguarly) he'd been backed all the way to the edge of the bed for fear of this lumpy, derp-eyed sheep; I could see the little indents in the comforter from his scaredy butt-shuffle of submission. \n\nEventually we broke and let Archer watch us squish and bounce the sheep around until he understood it was inanimate- a thing he never was brave enough to check for himself.",

Dusk stared at the plush in Shadow's pouch for a long time. Then she was reaching down, trying to taptap Shadow plush on the head. When Shadow plush did not respond, Dusk started screaming at Shadow plush and frantically taptapping her trying to get her to play. It broke all out hearts and now Shadow plush never goes nead the cat tree. \n\nDusk still looks for Shadow all the time, and I feel so bad for her.",

        "selftext": "This happened about thirty minutes ago. So I've been Covid gardening since March, growing stuff from seeds, and my tomatoes are monsters. Six feet high and still going. Temps have been in the upper 90's, so I need to water them twice a day. I check their condition, note they do need water, then see an actual TOMATO OMG. Since this is the first edible thing I've seen after three months of backbreaking work, I'm understandably excited. I lean forward to examine said first glorious tomato. As I do, my bright red hair swings into eyeball range, and I see a GIANT FUCKING WASP tangled in it. Now, in hindsight it probably was normal-sized, but as it was right in front of my eyeball, I promise you it looked gargantuan.\n\nThe wasp is, as you can imagine, not terribly pleased to be trapped in the thickets of my hair. I do not panic, however. I grab the base of that hank of hair and hold it while still leaning forward so the angry little bastard doesn't swing directly into my face. I go into problem-solving mode. The wasp does not wish to be in my hair-I do not wish the wasp to be in my hair. Yet, I sense, cooperation will not be possible. I instead enlist physics as my helper and attempt to fling the little fucker free by cracking my hair like a whip. Alas for my B grade in PH 221--Physics decided it is not my bitch today. I whip the angry little bastard RIGHT DOWN THE CLEAVAGE OF MY TANK TOP.\n\nSmall aside: I have more cleavage-related woes than any other two women I know. It is a black hole for bad luck. And on one memorable occasion, sushi from across a crowded restaurant. A TALE FOR LATER. \n\nHaving switched directly from \"not panicking I can solve this\" to \"panicking now I HAVE A WASP IN MY BOOBS,\" I yank the neck of my tank top forward in an attempt to keep the buzzing motherfucker from digging a hole in my fun bags. Luckily, the wasp appeared to watch a lot of fashion television and was instead attacking my tank top. I mean, I get it. No one wants to be flung into leaf green ribbed polyester. It is so last summer. \n\nHaving learned absolutely nothing from my previous flirtation with centripetal force, I again attempt to whip the little fucker free. Naturally, it goes directly into my face. I slap it away with my free hand, and it goes back into my cleavage. But fortunately this time it hits my boob at such an angle that it bounces out to freedom!\n\nStill bent forward and holding my tank top's neck at least a foot from me, I crow in victory and straighten up, immediately making awkward eye contact with the three stunned construction workers in my neighbor's back yard. No, I was not wearing a bra. So yeah, I just flashed those poor men with leaning forward middle-aged dangle boobs. Fluttering like pennants in the wind. Not the most flattering angle. \n\nDid I attempt to explain my entirely reasonable circumstances to those baffled people? No, I did not. I just scuttled inside like the fuck-up I am, and now I can never go outside again and my tomatoes still need to be watered. But I pinged that little winged bastard like a backhand at Wimbledon and I did NOT get stung, so not entirely a loss? I dunno.\n\ntl;dr: Monster tomatoes lead to cleavage wasp, and my titty semaphore is not understood by baffled bystanders.\n\nEdit: Wow, I crashed and went to bed after reading a few very nice comments that made my night, and woke up to a very full inbox. Thank you! Also, yes I snuck out after dark to water the tomatoes, they are going to be fine! I watered them again this morning. There are no construction people over at my neighbor's yet, but they appear to be building a fence, so I'm going back inside before they come back and continue with that.\n\nEdit the second: [Pics for those demanding them (banana for scale)](https://i.imgur.com/STu43Bk.jpg) and [The beauty you wanted](https://i.imgur.com/XF7VJDh.jpg)",

        "selftext": "Over the weekend I was staying at a popular UK chain hotel and thought I was going to be there until Sunday night. Well 1pm comes and I get back to the hotel early from having lunch and it turns out that they have a strict checkout time of 12pm to get your money back and I don\u2019t really want to stay there all day by myself miles away just for the sake of it. \n\nOver in the corner of the hotel lobby was a little lounge area with a sofa and some armchairs. There was a girl who must not have been much older than 18 or so asleep on the sofa and you could tell from her appearance that she was sleeping rough and had come inside out of the rain. The hotel reception staff walked over to her and were asking her to leave, which I understand, but I felt horrible for her. I followed her out into the car park and offered her my room key if she promised not to trash the room and as long as she checked out on time. She agreed and so I went on my way not really thinking much about it other than how she wouldn\u2019t have to sleep outside in the rain. \n\nI spoke to my brother later on and he informed me that if something bad happened to her in the room then it would be on me, so I was panicked all last night. I tried calling the hotel to tell them of the situation but couldn\u2019t get through. Well they called me this morning and it turns out that she didn\u2019t only trash the room, but that she also urinated in the hallway, tried to smash the vending machine and was in general a disturbance to other guests. The hotel informed me that I\u2019d have to pay for any damage and the reception lady gave me a very stern lecture about why they don\u2019t just give people rooms when they show up like that. Lesson learned, but at least an 18 year old girl didn\u2019t have to sleep outside in the rain and be open to any number of dangerous situations for a night I suppose. \n\nTL;DR I was checking out of an hotel early and there was an homeless girl sleeping in the lobby. She was being moved on so I gave her my room key and let her have the room. She trashed it and now I have to pay for damages.\n\nEdit: thank you so much for the awards guys! I\u2019ve never had a big post on Reddit before so it\u2019s hard to keep up, but I appreciate it!\n\nUPDATE: It\u2019s been months and i more or less forgot about this, but I received my bill today and it was \u00a3478 for damages and \u00a3210 for the room since it couldn\u2019t be used for 2 days. I expected worse to be honest, but it\u2019s still not great obviously.",

            "We were fostering a teen, so when my sister-in-law came to our home strung out yet seeking help again, we put her up in a local motel (because we literally couldn't have her around our foster daughter, who'd suffered a ton of trauma from drug abuse in the past). This was at midnight, with the understanding that I'd be back to pick her up in 6-8 hours and we'd be driving two hours north to rehab first thing. I got a call from the front desk manager at 5AM to come get her; she'd had people in and out of the motel all night. When I came to get her, the room was trashed, the screens were busted out of the window, there were needles all over, and... evidence of other less than savory behavior. That is when I learned the lesson you did; never put someone up in a motel room unless you are 100% ready to pay for any damage they might cause or might be pinned on them.\n\nHonestly, I consider it cheap; she could have died and then I'd have that on my conscience, but also be legally involved to boot! Look on the bright side: you tried to do the right thing, no one died, and now you've learned a lesson!",

            "This is the difficult part of the homeless issue. The reason its almost impossible to solve is that most people aren't homeless just due to lack of work or a bad economic turn...Rather they are homeless because they can't maintain a stable life, they destroy relationships and most things around them, either due to drug habits or mental illness (Which really are two in the same thing). \n\nSo its not just about giving the homeless a home; if it were that easy we could solve the issue. But most homeless need far more intensive help than a place to stay.",

            "As someone who worked professionally with the post-homeless in California, meaning those who wanted to leave the life, it's always best to leave trying to help the currently homeless to trained professionals (and they don't have much success). The homeless are overwhelmingly drug addicts and/or criminals. Majority of the mentally ill became that way due to drug use.\n\nNever once did I hear from one client that they were forced to be homeless. They will tell you they chose it. Many left because jail was so awful they'd do anything not to go back; others simply hit 30 and knew it was make the change or die. Whatever the cause of them choosing street life, they are overwhelmingly (although not entirely) untrustworthy. Either they don't care about themselves so why would they care for you or they are straight-up criminals, primarily thieves. \n\n\\*This was my experience in CA. I will say conditions causing homelessness could be different elsewhere.",

            "I did something similar once albeit my contact with the person came through other means. I was on a dating site, more aptly a hookup site. The woman in the pictures I matched with was attractive and we chatted a bit. Agreed to meet for dinner and see where the night led. Well thirty mins before supposed plans I get a message she'd rather just meet at a hotel and do the deed. I tell her while I'm not opposed to it (I was on a hookup site after all) I wanted to meet in public first so we both felt comfortable with one another. After a bit of back and forth she finally admitted she was homeless and was really looking to trade sex for a night in a hotel bc it was winter and was tired of sleeping outdoors or with people she didn't feel safe with. Being the softie I am I told her I wasn't interested in having her trade me that for a room, but offered to put her up in a little less nice hotel than originally planned but for a week (I had a limit on what I could spend and was trying to do the most good I could with that budget). My stipulation was that she still went to dinner (mostly a way to make sure she got a decent meal too and because she was pretty proud and didn't want to straight up take charity). I convinced her she'd be trading her time at dinner since I already had the plans and reservation for the room. She agreed. We had a decent dinner, she stayed a week at the hotel as far as I know. I never heard from her again. I like to think it was a good week for her but who knows. Luckily for me the room wasn't trashed and no negative consequences happened for me. I'd do it again if the same situation came up. Helping people when they're down without attaching demeaning or degrading strings makes me feel good. I suspect OP has a similar mindset.",
            "I\u2019ve been downvoted into oblivion so many times on Reddit for pointing out that most of the homeless people you actually see and notice (the chronically homeless) have untreated mental illness and/or substance abuse problems, and therefore you can\u2019t go about solving the homelessness crisis by taking an approach that would work with rational people who are just down on their luck.",

            "Not trying to rub salt in the wound, but this is a perfect example of \"help of convenience\" that I think everyone needs to know about and understand.\n\nThere's people in this thread saying \"serves you right, you should know better, that's why you don't interfere and keep to your own business\" and other people saying \"don't give up on people, it's great you tried to do the right thing\".\n\nThe problem here is that this feel-good kind of solution isn't the right thing, and the cold approach of just leaving her to her own devices also isn't the right thing. And if you look down this entire thread you'll see that these are the only two answers, nearly everyone is split into these two groups with different wrong approaches, and this is why we have 18yo girls trashing rooms and pissing in hallways.\n\nThe thing to realize is that neither one of these approaches actually helps. Even if things turned out as well as could be, it only solves this girl's problem for a single night, and at great risk to everyone involved. The cost-benefit is way out of whack. So if you're going to help someone like this, take responsibility for the situation and fucking help them. Get them to a shelter or somewhere that is designed to dive in and assess root causes and get them back on their feet.\n\nWhat OP did here is provide \"help of convenience\" meaning, well, I'm not really willing to do what is needed to actually make a difference, so instead I'm going to do the thing that makes a show of my intention to help without bothering about if it actually does any good. Oh, and it has a pretty good chance of making a LOT of other people's lives an absolute NIGHTMARE in the short term, but hey, *at least I tried to help*.\n\nThis is the most selfish possible thing to do. So OP, I hope you understand that you are being penalized here not because you are a good person paying a price for trying to be nice, but because it is your proper due. You made a bad decision and are fully responsible for the bad outcome. Don't sugarcoat this for yourself and try to tell yourself \"at least I blah blah blah\". You helped no one and created a lot of problems that didn't need to exist. Sometimes doing something halfway is worse than doing nothing, and you should have known this is one of those situations.\n\nNext time, if you want to help, HELP. If you can't be bothered to do something that will actually move the needle, just admit to yourself up front that you're not as good a person as you would like to pretend to be, and move on.",

He believed his wife was having people go through his house while he was at work, which sounds paranoid, but actually may have been true.

            "Shit happens, me and my girlfriend we have been together for 16 years now.\n\nSo i travel a bit for work and stay in different towns every now and then, and one job that came up over and over again for me was going to Gothenburg and working there for a week. Now this was so common that i always stayed at the same place, its called Linn\u00e8platsen but we go there so often we just call it Linnea which is a girls name in Sweden. So you can already see where this is going.\n\nAnyway im packing a bag with some stuff for work and my girlfriend asks \"where are you going to stay\" and me being a moron just say at Linneas place. Anyway im a bit stressed because the taxi is waiting outside already so i dont look at my girlfriend really, i just walk out. Saying \"bye i love you, see you in a week, ill call you when i get there\".\n\nFor some reason when i called her later that day she didnt pick up, called her a bit later and she didnt pick up which was unusual to say the least. I dont think about the conversation we had when i left at all. I try calling her again and again but she doesnt pick up, after a few hours i get a text saying \"how could you, i fucking hate you never come back\".\n\nNow im really confused and scared, like what the hell is going on here. I text her a few times and ask her to say whats wrong, because im not the brightest person in the world. Finally she says \"you are sleeping at Linneas place when you work there, how the fuck can you do that to me?\" and then it dawns on me. She thought i was sleeping at some random womans place in gothenburg when i worked there, like i was having this affair or that i was cheating on her.\n\nSo i take my phone and take lots of pictures, first of me in the hotel room, then of me in the lobby and then on me in front of the entrance where you can see the name of the hotel, and i say this is what we call Linneas place, its a hotel in gothenburg. Call my work and ask them where i am they will tell you, ask them to give you the address and you will see its this hotel but they will probably all say that im sleeping at Linneas.\n\nThat was a major fuckup on my part. All is good but she was overly emotional for like a month because of that fuckup. Probably because i stressed her out of her mind royally. She just heard her boydfriend saying casually that he was staying at some random womans place in gothenburg when he was there for work, no fucking wonder.\n\nFor me calling it Linneas was well what we all called it and had always called it because the company had some sort of deal with them so it was cheaper, so that was usually where we stayed there. It was also easier to stay there because we just had to say our name and that we came from this company and then it was all set already. Sometimes the company even did that for us, they called the hotel and said that me or someone else would come over and stay a week from this to that date. And then they just said you'll be sleeping at Linneas.\n\nDont know why we have that name for it, it probably started as some sort of male ego joke. Someone trying to play it cool like he had a girl in gothenburg and started calling it Linnea instead of Linn\u00e8 as is the name.",

I decided that it was my problem not hers, and that this may be one of those rare occasions where it would be more healthy for our relationship to leave the past in the past.\n\nOur sex life is back to normal and I feel like I\u2019ve mostly processed the situation in a healthy way. We all have things in our past, and the most important thing is we are happy and we love each other.  \n\nI thought I would also use this as an opportunity to address some of the most common questions/comments.\n\n\u2014\n\nWHY DOES SHE STILL HAVE THE PICTURES?\n\nHonestly I think she probably forgot. We all have stuff on our phones going back years. I found some nudes of exes that I had forgotten about so I guess I\u2019m as bad as her.\n\nHOW DID YOU KNOW IT WAS HER EX?\n\nBecause I could see a gallery of thumbnails from the same set and some had his face in\n\nWAS IT PHOTOSHOPPED OR A STRAP-ON?\n\nNo\n\nYOU MUST BE EXAGGERATING NO DICK IS THAT BIG\n\n2 coke cans is about right. It was bigger than her forearm.\n\nAs you can imagine, I\u2019ve also received a bunch of dick pics in my DMs with guys comparing their dicks to 2 coke cans. Thanks for that chaps.  \n\nA DICK THAT BIG COULDN\u2019T GET HARD\n\nIt certainly seemed rock hard in the pictures, but she had previously mentioned that an ex had erection problems and relied on viagra. So maybe you\u2019re right.\n\nHER PUSSY MUST BE STRETCHED/CAVERNOUS/GAPING\n\nShe probably has the tightest vagina of all the girls I\u2019ve been with. I guess you don\u2019t know how vaginas work.\n\n\u2014\n\nSomeone told me that my original post was the most upvoted NSFW post in the history of Reddit. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true, but I guess that\u2019s pretty cool.\n\n\n\nTL;DR accidentally saw pictures of my girlfriend sucking the biggest dick in the world, processed the situation in a healthy way and everything is back to normal",

I kinda almost feel bad for him.\n\nI was with a man who i couldnt properly blow because while he was above average id say, he was no goliath by any means. He was how ever very curved (which works wonders for hitting the g-spot in missionary and he was INCREDIBLE at foreplay) but other positions always hurt a bit. And being a person who enjoys giving oral and watching my partner peak from my hard work, it was a huge hit to my self esteem and ego. \n\nIt was through no fault of his own, and i did learn that he was just as self conscious about it as me.\n\nYouve got a self proclaimed above average dick and a girl who you seem to be in love with who wants to move in with you loves you too.

You probabky satisfy her and make her feel gratified more than she had by enjoying what she does for you.\n\n2 coke cans sounds painful and intimidating and like a nuissance.

        "selftext": "Some backstory: I used to get a lot of UTIs. Like, _a lot_ a lot, no matter what I did. Boyfriend and I would both shower before sex, I would pee immediately after, I drank water like a camel, took urinary health supplements, everything I could think of. I would still get 8-12 of them a year, a couple of which turned into kidney infections and landed me in the hospital. I was constantly on antibiotics, and at one point I was prescribed an antibiotic to take every time after I had sex. It destroyed my gut bacteria and pH balance down there, and I was miserable and in pain constantly. \n\n\nI was told pretty much the same thing by every doctor I went to: I need to pee after sex, drink more water, etc. I told them I was already doing all of these things, and they said some women just get them more frequently than others for some reason.\n\n\nThe last time I ended up in the ER with a kidney infection, the kind ER doctor told me that in his 45+ years of practicing medicine, he had never seen a healthy young woman have that many UTIs. There is absolutely something wrong, and I need to see a specialist about it ASAP. \n\n\nFast forward 4 weeks and a referral to a urologist later, my doctor runs a series of tests. One of these tests is a uroscopy which, if you\u2019ve never had one, is where a very small camera is inserted into your bladder through your urethra and is just about as pleasant as it sounds. It didn\u2019t take my doctor long to discover the cause of my constant UTIs: there was a growth/tumor in there. It had formed a pocket which the doctor said was collecting bacteria, contributing to both the frequency and severity of my UTIs being increased. \n\n\nSince there was no way to know if this was a birth defect, a benign growth, or literal cancer without a biopsy, surgery was scheduled immediately to have it removed. The biopsy found that it was not cancerous, which I am infinitely grateful for. Since recovering from surgery, I have not had a single UTI, have gotten off antibiotics, and am able to have a normal sex life with my boyfriend without the fear getting sent to the hospital. My fuck up is that I suffered for years and years instead of getting help, thinking that what I was going through was normal.\n\n\nTL;DR My constant UTIs were being caused by a growth inside of my bladder, and I spent years suffering before getting treatment because I was told women getting frequent UTIs was normal.",

            "Had this happen. Even once went from \"I feel pretty good today for once\" to bleeding when I pee within a few hours and landed right in the ER with one of the worst infections I've ever had. Turns out after many years of hearing \"you shouldn't get these so often\" and the same BS you were given, I found out I had loads of cysts in my bladder while they were doing surgery for endometriosis. This was apparently contributing to the repeated infections and no one just cared to listen when I kept saying I was trying to do everything right and it just wouldn't go away.\n\nI hope you're feeling better, and you fired your last AH doctor for not taking it more seriously.",

I\u2019m sorry that you suffered for so long and had to get surgery, but in a way I am\nJealous of you that you actually had a condition and not that you are just prone to them. I used to get them all the time - I take a bunch of supplements and I found this company called Uqora that has a drink that flushes out your urinary tract. I also was prescribed the after sex antibiotic and I usually will swap between the Uqora drink & the antibiotic, depending on what the activity is afterwards because sometimes it\u2019s very inconvenient to mix a drink. I also take a probiotics so my gut and PH are fine at least for now. But anyway. It\u2019s been awhile for me since I\u2019ve had one but I\u2019m still scarred!

I drink a LOT of water, I knew that wasn\u2019t the case, and always peed regularly and after sex. Finally did a urinalysis which was a nightmare series of tests and they found the drainage issue. Doc put me on alfuzosin which is a prostate medication (I\u2019m AFAB so that\u2019s always funny) and just like that, cured after years of pissing straight blood and chunks of bladder lining when it got bad. Apparently it\u2019s a smooth muscle relaxer that doesn\u2019t just affect the prostate.

            "Time for a women-getting-ignored-by-doctors story. \n\nI got a few terrible UTIs in a row for a while, and it was the worst pain of my life. I went to the doctor, and told her I was a virgin, but she told me Chlamydia is rampant in populations of people \u201clike me\u201d and gave me a $100 STI test anyway. At the time I was too shy to say no.\n\nI told another doctor that I usually got them when I didn\u2019t drink water and ate a ton of sugar (I was addicted to sugar at the time\u2026I literally carried sugar cubes in my bag to snack on all day). She told me citrus is a common irritant, but not sugar. I had her look it up to see that I was right. So I paid a ton of money to see a doctor that I had to teach medical information to\u2026.\n\nI ended up cutting back on sugar and taking hydration seriously and I haven\u2019t had any UTIs since then.

Im so lucky i went to the hospital and ignored their advice (even at the hospital took a med student to properlly diagnoise me and he probably saved my life)\n\nThe second time it happened to me was far more long term, I had swimmers ear for literally i kid you not 4-5 years straight. I basically lived with an ear infection and after going to 20-30+ doctors and them EVEN LOOKING IN MY EARS told me there was nothing, i literally only got help by a chemist... \n\nIm so much better now, its insane that i used to live with it. **I really dont have a good opinion if doctors.**\n\nGood job OP im very pleased you got the help you needed after being brushed off by the people you trust with your health.",

            "This thread is huge so this will probably get buried, but I had a similar experience with urinary pain over the past 2 years.\n\nGot a brutal UTI when I first got together with my boyfriend in May of 2020 and it never really seemed to go away. I was in constant discomfort. Antibiotics made the worst of the pain subside for a bit but every single day I would have a bout of some sort of discomfort for a couple of hours. Sometimes it would come back with a vengence and I would go to the doctor, but my test would come back clear and they would write it off as vaginal sensitivity that I was confusing with urinary pain. \n\nJuly 2021 I started having side pain and a fever alongside the pain. I called telehealth to try to fasttrack some antibiotics but the doctor insisted it was just a muscle stitch (????) and that he wouldn't prescribe antibiotics unless I wanted to go in for another pee test to be absolutely sure. I said I would do that, but didn't even make it because next morning I stood up out of bed and promptly passed out, landing myself in the ER instead. Obviously their test confirmed I had a bladder infection and I was given antibiotics again. At this point I was obsessively taking cranberry pills, peeing before and after sex, washing with antibiotic Dove, and taking D mannose drink packets. Another doctor gave me antibiotics to take after sex as well (which I didn't do, just kept them on hand in case I had another fever/side pain flair up). The daily pain persisted, and I found myself with a weird lapse in health coverage so I couldn't badger a doctor into sending me to a urologist. \n\nEarly this year I was absently browsing the side effects of an unrelated medication because I felt like it was killing my sex drive and was considering stopping it. Cue the realization that it's most major side effect is that of a diuretic, and I put the pieces together. I had been taking a high dose of a urinary tract irritant daily for *years*. I had been cutting out things like caffeine and spicy food at the order of the doctor when I was at my worst because they can exacerbate urinary issues, but this medication remained. Not a single doctor had bothered to look into my medications, or anything on my chart apparently, when I kept complaining of urinary discomfort but tested negative over and over again. I quit cold turkey and I haven't had any issues since last year and it's been a huge weight off of my daily life. Thank god it wasn't something serious like OP's issues, but being in daily pain for almost 2 years with zero help was fucking awful. The fact that I had to solve the problem myself when it would have been so easy for a doctor to take a quick peek at my history and current medications is absurd.",

            "Be your own patient advocate! I complained about a strange pain that was only increasing in intensity and frequency over about 6 months. The best I could describe it is it felt like when you're a kid and you run and play in the snow and get out of breath and your lungs burn with the cold air. This burning pain would go up my neck and into my jaw where it felt like my jaw was being broken. I had nine ER visits, and three doctors who told me it was nerves, or a result of being slightly overweight, I even had my gallbladder out. I finally thought I was legit dying and called an ambulance again. I called a couple of times the previous months and it made me super hesitant to call again, they were just going to hook me up to monitors tell me that my heart was fine, they saw nothing wrong with anything, and acted like I was a hysterical girl. This time one of the ambulance attendants, who I actually sought out and thanked personally for starting the chain of events that eventually saved my life, simply told me to go to a different emergency room. He said obviously something is wrong and those doctors apparently can't find it. He drove 45 minutes away to a large Hospital who to have a cardiologist in the ER seeing another patient. He immediately admitted me and scheduled a heart cath. That's where they put the little camera and the dye in your heart to check the flow of blood. Immediately after getting the results I was told I needed emergency heart surgery. He said I was about 24 hours from a Widowmaker heart attack. I had two blockages that were 98%, and two more that were 99.5% blocked. I had coronary artery bypass graft surgery, with four bypasses. It took me nearly a year to recover and get back to normal. I'm so glad you just kept insisting something was wrong and had a doctor that listened to you. I wish you much luck.",

Nothing in my life has changed, except the fact that the medication took away the urge to CONSTANTLY be eating.\n\nEdit: I had tried to lose weight in the past and it was extremely difficult no matter what diet I tried or how much exercise I was getting.",

I learned everything I could and the urinary tract and have been very vocal to everyone I've heard say they've had a UTI. I'm always surprised when a woman says she has one every other month and blame it on sex. Nope. See a urologist and get tested. Do not take no for an answer.

So, I'm on a Sales Department WebEx Call (probably 300 people) and since no one has seen me in about a month, it was a bit of a surprise to see me with facial hair.  A friend at the company privately messages me through WebEx, \"Dude what happened to your face?\"  I thought it would be funny to reply with \"Good News!  I finally hit puberty!!!\"  except that message wasn't private - it went to everyone on the call...  like everyone - without any context around it.  Just imagine sitting there on a company webex call listening to the SVP of Sales and out of nowhere your coworker sends you a message saying \"Good News! I finally hit puberty.\"  That coworker was me.\n\nTL;DR Coworker sent private message to me on a call with 300 people asking about my new beard.  I accidentally sent the 300 people a message saying \"Good News! I finally hit puberty!!!\"\n\n\nEdit: Glad you all enjoyed the story.. Totally unrelated but since I'll never have an audience this big again, I am announcing my faith publicly. The Bible says, if I deny Him before men, He will deny me before His Father in Heaven so with an audience of 100,000+ people, I am a believer in Jesus Christ. I believe He is the son of God, was crucified on the cross and died for my sins but rose on the 3rd day to give me salvation. I accept Jesus as my Lord and Savior...Boom.",

Technically, it's just a stand-alone Emergency Room, and if anybody needs further  treatment, they get sent to one of two or three \"real\" hospitals.\n\nShe's a nurse that just started working here, and I've just started getting  to know. She was telling me about her upcoming wedding today, and we  chatted for a little bit about her selling her old house, my marriage  jitters five years ago, and the like. It seemed very friendly, and I  could tell how excited she was for this wedding. She had kind things to  say about me and my story, but I took it as just friendly chatter instead of flirting.\n\nI was sitting  at my desk, browsing reddit on one screen while the cameras are on the  other, and I saw movement in the triage room, which is odd because there  aren't any patients in the building. Nobody in the lobby either. It's  the nurse who's about to get married, who slips off her shoes. And  pants. And top. I could see she shaves her bikini area, and the lacy  bits on her bra, which is all she's wearing except socks. She steps onto  the scale, fiddles with her bra a little bit, and then steps back off  and gets dressed again.\n\nNow my  heart is racing. I'm sick to my stomach; I can't believe what I just  saw. It feels gross to have intruded on something like that. What am I  supposed to do? I decide that what I'm not going to do is tell my  supervisor. I don't think there's a way for me to delete the video  footage, and I know that if my higher-ups know what to look for, they  can find it. I don't think they just browse everything randomly, though,  so if I don't draw attention to it, chances are good no one else will  see it. Right?\n\nNone of that was my  fault. What was my fault, is that I got her attention on her way out  the door and said something really stupid.\n\n\"Hey, good luck showing the house.\"  \n\"Thanks!\" She smiled.  \n\"Hey,\" I hesitated. The anxiety started to choke me.  \n\"I don't know how to tell you this, but there are cameras in the triage room.\"  \n\n\nI  watched confusion make way to realization, followed by disgust. Utter  disgust. Anger, perhaps? I was still reeling and wondering how I  expected this news to be taken. I hadn't thought that far ahead.  \n\n\n\"I did not know that,\" she spat out, trying to look anywhere but at me.  \n\n\n\"I  won't tell anyone. Umm, good luck fitting in your wedding dress? See  you later.\" I still don't know where in the everlasting hell that came  from. She left without saying anything more.\n\nTL;DR ... I should have just suffered in silence with the knowledge of  what my co-worker's naked body looked like. The look of disgust on her  face is now burned in my face more than her nudity ever was.\n\nI don't plan on telling anyone at work what I saw, but venting to reddit may help me get these emotions in check enough to sleep before my next shift. Tylenol PM will probably help, too.  \n\n\nEDIT: I mentioned a lot of details about her state of undress, trying to get across the point that the [cameras had a pretty good shot](https://imgur.com/a/YaiR1xA). I don't think I can pan or zoom, but I didn't have to. And she wasn't wearing any panties under her scrubs, hence the \"just bra and socks.\"   \n\n\nMy only explanation for the \"Good luck fitting in your dress\" comment is that I was desperately trying to move the conversation forward in a positive direction. And that was the best explanation in my mind for her behavior, so it was the first thing my anxious brain caught hold of. It really wasn't supposed to be a fat joke because she is absolutely slim. Yes, I know I'm clueless. Hence why I'm in /r/TIFU.  \n\n\n I really didn't want to believe that she was flirting in our conversation, and that she would do it on purpose, but I left out the fact that our conversation directly before the incident started with me saying something along the lines of \"Hey, I played back the camera footage, and that creepy guest that didn't leave when the patient they were visiting left? Yeah, I made sure they left the building. They're gone.\" Thirty minutes after that conversation, she is [standing directly under a camera and demonstrating that she's been going commando all night.](https://imgur.com/a/YaiR1xA) The timing was slightly suspicious, but I didn't want to believe it.  \n\n\nAlthough now a third option comes to mind. Being really slim and having a compulsion to weigh yourself at work... could that possibly indicate a former or current eating disorder? Now I'm even more of a jerk. \n\nI told my wife, and she was slightly embarrassed for the nurse and for me, but being a nurse herself, she's inserted enough catheters to not be phased by the human body too much. We still had sex before she went to bed and I went to work.",

And apparently you watched long enough to see she shaved and how she adjusted her bra and got on the scale. But you make it seem like you were upset for seeing her naked. I know people can undress quickly but noticing specific details like that is something different. You were watching her.\n\nYou can still be happily married and not interested in this woman, but also be intrigued by a woman who is attractive undressing in front of your eyes. That's normal. But it's a question of personal morals as to whether you should have looked away once you realized what was happening or what. You know the hospital better than anyone. And the triage room should mean there shouldn't be much of anything that employees can steal. Medicines are kept locked up. And triage means people are coming in left and right. Do you really watch every hospital staff member who enters the room for what they are doing? No. Most hospitals carry the footage for a year if not more, so if there are any legal issues, then the footage could be reviewed.\n\nI think you were okay with telling her that there's camera's there. But you need to understand that she's now wondering the same thing. How much did you watch and why did you watch? If you have a legit security issues such as reports of theft or a policy that says you have to watch that screen anytime someone is in there, then bring it up with her.\n\nBut I've worked hospital security before too. We aren't glued to the security screen. And we never had to watch employees. Honestly, with all the regulations, all inventories of hospitals are highly monitored. And with surveillance requirements, there's no real need to watch that closely.\n\nAnd she knows that. So it might have been better to have told her there's camera's in there, because I saw you starting to take off your pants and I immediately turned away, but that footage could be viewed by other people.\n\nAnd then you need to reassess your own morals and integrity of watching a known and probably trusted co-worker on a surveillance feed that is definitely stored for long periods of time for criminal, personnel or other legal issues, and who you know is undressing and doesn't appear to be violating any security policies. You literally watch the girl undress and adjust her bra (I don't know why that needed to be a detail), and then go weigh herself. Which probably took more than 30 seconds. And you stopped long enough to note whether she was shaved or not.\n\nI mean, as security in a hospital, I saw more dicks and vag than I ever wanted, and I was there for only a year. But I always tried to advert my eyes whenever possible. Even on surveillance. Last thing I would want is some co-worker coming up behind me, and seeing I was staring at a screen of someone getting undressed without any security issue.",

The cupboard had little slits pointing downwards, so i could see out of, but no one could see in.\n\nThis wasnt the main bathroom in the party area, so i didnt think much of it.\n\nNo more than 1 minute after ive been a hiding, one of the moms comes running in very fast, closes and locks the door almost in a panic and just instantly drops her pants and starts shitting this liquid diarrhea. \n\nIt happened so quick, i didnt even have time to open the cupboard and say \"hold on, im playing hiding seek and im in here\".\n\nNow that she started shitting, i couldnt reveal myself. I panicked sooooo hard, thinking she would find me out, or someone would see me walk out of the bathroom after her, or stay in there long enough for someone else to walk in.\n\n I just curled myself up in a ball with my head between my legs and stayed as still as i could. I figured at least if i get busted, she will see that i was not looking because i was extremely worried to be seen as some kind of peeping tom hiding in the bathroom.\n\nAfter about 5 minutes of hell and panic, she was done and left.

            "You make a post about a pitbull AND a kitten without pictures?! The audacity!\n",
            "Ok. I wont talk about the tifu. But I have a great deal of experience rehabilitating and rehoming dogs that have been abused/neglected. \n\nFirst off good for you for providing a happy and safe home for your pup. Lets talk about ways to help your dog move past its fear of objects and strangers. Repetition. Its been trained to expect bad things under specific conditions. Raised hands. Objects lifted above. Probably doesnt like people standing/coming up behind them. Or even the presence of strangers. Maybe even a specific gender or race. These are as you know classic responses to abuse. \n\nHow do we help the dog move past these? You are already doing the big part. A safe happy home, a good walk schedule and plenty of love and attention. The longer nothing bad happens to your pup the more he'll forget that anything can. \n\nNow how about some behavioral training. People tend to think if your dog doesnt like something then avoid it. Example. \"My dog doesnt like it when we touch his paws.\" So they never do it. They pet his head, his back, give belly rubs. But never touch his paws. Because of this he freaks out when they try to trim his nails. How to fix this, incorporate paw touching into pets. A little at first then more and more. When you give treats put them into a sit or a down and put the treats under their paws. Play handshake. Make what they dont like fun by incorporating it into a game. \n\nHow to apply this philosophy to your dog. Add an object to your play. A rope toy or large chew toy, if he likes fetch a chuckit works well. Something that if you raised it would incite his fear/defense response. Dont raise it. Keep it low and play. Every so often toss it over his head. Then pass/swoop it over his head. Have friends do it to when they come over. Or people at the dog park. Over time he will forget that sticks mean pain and remember that with you now they mean play. \n\nCarry treats with you on walks and ask people to give one to your dog. The more people he meets that dont hurt him is a pattern that your dog will recognize. \n\nKeep it fun. Never pressure them. He will let you know the pace he is comfortable with. Dogs dont learn things you want them to under pressure. They learn when its fun.",

            "I would caution you to be careful putting them together until the kitten learns how to behave.  I had a experience where our big bad \"rescued\" pit cowered to a yippy chihuahua pup.  This pup was constantly nipping at the dogs cheeks, so he would retreat and hide out upstairs so he could rest.  Once the smaller dog was able to climb the stairs he startled the big dog during a nap and the bigger dog instinctively put a hole in the smaller dogs skull with his tooth.   He didn't mean to but it just happened that quickly.   I would advice you to keep them separated as much as possible until the kitty learns some boundaries.

Tomorrow you can reap more Karma with \"TIFU by making Pitbull Owners look like pretentious fools.\"\n\nIn all seriousness, though. Read the top-voted comments from people calling you out and saying you're a bad pet owner. Discarding them as \"anti-pitbull lunatics\" only makes you look worse, because they bring up very good points. Being \"qualified with animal behaviour\" doesn't mean a thing as your actions suggest otherwise, and it's pretty clear that not \"all safety was ensured.\" Your mother cannot stop a large dog (regardless of the breed) from biting and killing a small kitten, and the fact she didn't intervene at all when your kitten started scaring the dog means that she would've let it escalate until your dog switched from flight to fight mode.\n\nYour subsequent edits to your post aren't helping you. They're implying you don't intend to change your dangerous behavior with an unpredictable dog. You'll probably just discard this, thinking I'm also one of those \"anti-pitbull lunatics\" to be condescended at. But people aren't snipping at you because your dog is a Pitbull. You're getting grilled because by your own description your dog has previous trauma, is easily frightened, and has shown signs of physical aggression towards strangers. Your dog could be a Shih Tzu and you'd still be getting flak.\n\nI get that you're trying to dispel the myth that Pitbulls are vicious killers, and showing that your Pitbull (despite its aggression and previous abuse) is actually timid and scared of kittens. Maybe if your story ended with the Pitbull cuddling, nurturing, licking, and loving the kitten, then maybe people wouldn't be so appalled. But that's not how the story ends; your dog is frightened and stressed by the kitten, meaning there's still a very strong potential for a violent reaction. Anybody \"qualified with animal behaviour\" would tell you that.\n\nAll you're doing is making Pitbull owners look careless and condescending, and it's especially frustrating to read your edits because it shows you're too ignorant to understand why.\n\n**Ironic Edit:**\n\nUpon further reading in this thread, you have no actual qualifications with animal behavior, you're just taking preliminary veterinary courses. Basically, your only qualifications are successfully applying for college courses. You don't actually have any sort of certification at all.\n\nAlso, this petulant [\"well I got upvotes so you're wrong\"](https://i.imgur.com/jTdYd9L.png) mentality doesn't mean you're right, it means people agreed you fucked up. **You are posting to the \"Today I Fucked Up\" subreddit**, this spectacular failure of judgment and common sense on your part is prime A+ material here, you indeed deserve the front page top spot, and many thousands of people agree.\n\n[*I* absolutely agree.](https://i.imgur.com/4MlgSfg.png)\n\nThe top voted replies that *aren't* slapping you for improper decision making are people relieved that the story didn't end tragically. **They are not calling you smart. They are calling you lucky.**\n\nOr, they just want to see pictures of cute animals being cute.",

I'm like \"Yeah?\" Then he's like \"Asalamalekun\" and I replied with \"Wa alikum Salam\" because I've heard it in a Rick Ross song before. So now he thinks we're Muslim but I was like fuck it I'm gonna grabs sausage cuz it's bomb and my sister grabbed bacon.

Then you tell the manager he's awesome and you'd like the chance to share a meal with his employee and fill out whatever feedback form you can. Make time for it.\n\nAt this meal, you repeat your appreciation, ask about his background and reasons and tell a little about yourself. You then explain that you really don't need that kind of accommodation but that you've seen people that do and that his professionalism has no doubt made others more comfortable and happier.\n\nMake sure to tell him in good humor that you didn't want to injure his good character and so went through this approach. \n\nModify this scenario as needed.",

In the morning I woke up, stood up and stretched, and then headed out to the kitchen. I grabbed a glass of water and chugged it, and then checked my period tracker app. The app said I was a couple days late, so I decided to take a pregnancy test. \n\nI went to the bathroom, opened up the test, sat down and began to take it. When I looked at the test, the screen was completely distorted. I couldn\u2019t read if it was positive or not, so I decided to try another one. \n\nI open a new test, sit down, and miraculously, have a lot more pee in me. I start peeing like a mad man. It is just FLOWING out of me onto the stick. It seems never ending. \n\nAnd then suddenly it stops. \n\nAnd I wake up. In my boyfriends tiny bed. With him sleeping soundly right next to me. A puddle of my piss spreading across the mattress like wildfire. \n\nIt was on his sheets, comforter, and his shirt that I was wearing. Luckily I was able to wake him and get him to move before it reached him. \n\nThe level of embarrassment I felt was insane. We took the sheets off and cleaned up, but I didn\u2019t have a change of clothes so I had to put on yesterday\u2019s dirty clothes and sit in shame. \n\nHe\u2019s been cracking bed wetter jokes all day now and I truly feel like I\u2019ll never live this down. \n\nTLDR: dreamt I was taking a pregnancy test, actually pissed in my boyfriends bed.\n\nEdit: I feel like some people are misunderstanding. My boyfriend \u201ccracking bed wetter jokes\u201d isn\u2019t a bad/rude thing. I think it\u2019s funny, and he\u2019s a really great guy. He was completely understanding, helped me clean up and didn\u2019t for a second make me feel like I should be ashamed. He tried to make me feel better about it, and then afterwards the jokes started. Now it\u2019s sort of like an inside joke. This TIFU is lighthearted!",

We had matched a week or two back to my surprise and started talking about our personal interests; TV shows, movies, and what not. After my conversational cannon fodder of questions started to run dry, I decided \"fuck it\" and asked if she wanted to see Rogue One with me last Friday night. She said yes!\n\nThe night comes and I decide to start getting ready by picking out some nice looking clothes aside from the typical bullshit that I wear on a daily basis. Jeans, a white shirt, boots, and a nice jacket I'd received from my mother on Christmas. It was raining too so I grabbed an umbrella on my way out.\n\nI get on the train and walk to the rendezvous. I wait 10 or so minutes and see her walking down the street. Nervous, I walk out into the rain with the umbrella to meet her. We shake hands, say hi to one another, and I ask if she's ready to head down to the movie theater. She says yes and off we go.\n\nHere's where it went south.\n\nWe're walking through the rain and come up to a big, water-filled street corner. I'm not sure whether it was nerves or my own lack of social skills which compelled me to do what I did, but I immediately stop and start to take off my jacket. Confused, she asks what I'm doing to which I reply, \"I got this.\"  She quickly realizes what I'm about to do and starts saying \"Oh, you don't have t-\". \n\nI cut her off by throwing my jacket into this huge puddle expecting her to walk on it and onto the curb like you see in old movies/shows. The silence quickly makes me realize what I've done. I mutter out a \"After you...\" and she continues to stare at me.\n\nWithout a word, she ghosts me on the spot. I pick my jacket up out of the puddle and make my walk of shame home.\n\nMaybe next time.",

            "Hold my beer... I got this...\n\nI was also an awkward teenager and didn't date much (read: \"at all\"), though in the end social grace was not the deciding factor of this tale.  You see, quite by accident at a role playing game I caught the attention of the only cute girl who gamed. Don't know what won her over, though she kept wanting me to get a Mohawk and speak with an Australian accent. Did my best Mick Dundee for her, but never went full bird of paradise.\n\nAnywho, she was more experienced and aggressive so it was an arms race (among other parts) to keep up with her. One day, early on, we go on a date... I say date.. At 17 we drove to an unoccupied construction site near my house, hopped in the back seat and started making out.\n\nNow, for once I am holding my own and things are getting pretty hot. I was feeling pretty good, I must say: confident, assertive, in control. Man, I was the Mac (dated myself there, didn't I).  Then it happened. I don't know if it was lunch or nerves or the full moon, but suddenly I felt a tremulation in my bowels and I knew with the certainty of a condemned man that I was about to shit myself.\n\nWithout a word, I vaulted into the front seat and drove that old station wagon like an Indy car; ass cheeks clamped the whole way. The confused girl didn't speak. Curiosity and concern had frozen her as she sat in the back straightening her clothes out. \n\nI rounded the last corner, skidded to a stop in my parents driveway, leapt out and into the house (my soon to be ex in pursuit) and ran into the bathroom slamming the door behind me as I dropped trow. Not sure to this day if the pants came off before or after the door closed. It was then that hell opened up on Earth. The force of it; the noise; the smell. It was like the sweaty ass of Satan himself.\n\n&lt;Camera focus shifts outside the bathroom.> The girl is standing not three feet from my hell cell the whole time in stunned silence; my parents are sitting watching TV in the adjoining room. This was how they met. After what seemed like hours to her I flush and walk out. No one says a word as I offer to take her home. At her place I muttered some embarrassed apology as she got out of the car. \n\nThat day was not listed in the official ledger for why we broke up, but things seemed to cool off after that. No idea what happened to her. For all I know she was the one that invented Poopouri. If so, I wonder if I might be due for royalties.",

            " There is a fine line between being charming or creepy. \n\n I've done the same thing when I was 17 but with good results. I was walking this girl I was with home when it started raining hard at the beach. So randomly I took off my jacket and put it down then walked her across. She thought it was funny, sweet, and charming when I did it. My jacket was already ruined anyways so it didn't matter. It was just a spontaneous gesture. \n\n A minute later we stopped at a gas station to get some snacks and that's when I remembered my wallet was in the jacket! So I grab my wallet to get my cash out when ALL this water spilt out on the counter. I don't even know how that wallet held all that water in it but it started spilling everywhere and we both tried to stop it from getting the the muffins we were buying wet and ended up knocking into each others head. \n\n The girl and I started laughing so hard together we couldn't breath for like five minutes. The cashier was not amused at all and just stared at us like, \"What the fuck is wrong with you two?\"\n\n I ended up having to ring out all the cash because it was so waterlogged. The worse part is I had 50$ in ones from getting tips at my job. (And for playing carnival games to win prizes.) \n\n The whole time we dated she would burst out laughing randomly any time she thought of that knight. \n\n I guess the difference is that it wasn't a first date and she was the type of girl with a good sense of humor who likes things like that. I've dated other women who don't even like me opening doors for them. \n\n \n\n ",
            "Haha, as a female, I would have thought it was absurd but I would have just laughed at you and continued on the date. Sorry that ended up being a deal breaker for her. ",

Then we would have finished watching the movie with Mr. Soggy on the floor. \n\nYou might have done something silly, but it wasn't to demean her. It wasn't to hurt anyone at all. You just wanted to show you cared for someone. That is nothing to mock, and certainly nothing to abandon. \n\nThanks for trying to be a good guy, OP. \n\nAnd don't feel too bad.

        "selftext": "So, my wife loves big loads. I don't know why, but it's something she's always been into, and she'll do weird shit like make me drink more water or eat celery if she wants to have a lot of sex later that day. I don't get it, but it's her thing. \n\nA few weeks back she went on a 10 day business trip. I wanted to surprise her when she got back so I ordered a supplement that's meant to help in that area. My plan was that the first time we had sex once she got back I would blow her away by shooting web like I was Spiderman fighting the Crazy 88s. Then she'd think I was the pinnacle of masculinity and would love me even more. Didn't work out like that. \n\nShe got back last Friday and we didn't do anything special that night- just relaxed and slept. On Saturday morning I got everything ready for her to go to her niece's birthday party at my MIL's house- I wrapped the gifts, picked up some cupcakes, and even cleaned the house. I don't like my MIL and stay home from stuff there, so I figured I would make things easier for my wife since she had just gotten back from a long trip. Well, my loving wife decided to reward me. With a blowjob. \n\nShe was all dressed up and ready to go (cute sundress, nice formal shoes, makeup and hair done), but sat me down on the couch beforehand and pulled my pants down. I debated telling her here whether or not I had been taking the supplements (I hadn't jerked off in about a week so I had no idea if they even worked) but decided not to. I meant to surprise her, and boy did I. \n\nSo, to cut to the chase: I was about to finish and told her so. She just nodded and kept going. What a champ. Then I started to cum, and then I did again, and again, and again. \n\nIt. just. kept. coming. \n\nAt this point my wife threw herself back from me and did an imitation of Chewbacca fighting a swarm of hornets. She was screaming out a gurgled \"what the fuuuuuuuuck\" while pawing in front of her face. She started coughing and it got everywhere- her hair, dress, face- even the gift. \n\nShe was already late so she didn't have enough time to change and get dressed up again. She threw on some jeans and a  nice shirt, rinsed her hair out and let it down, and went to the party. It should be noted that her eyes get red when she coughs a lot, and she was pretty tired from just getting back the night before. \n\nWell, an hour and a half later she sent me [these texts](https://imgur.com/a/nwy6It7). To be honest, I thought it was kind of hilarious (and so did my wife). My MIL is really religious and anal about everything and stuff like this can happen quite a bit. My wife doesn't even smoke. \n\nBut, her mom ended up calling her later that day saying essentially \"if you're going to get high and can't even get ready for your nieces birthday party, then you can't come over at all\" and now wants to see her doing some type of rehab before having contact with her. Oof. \n\nTL;DR: Took a load boosting supplement, came like a fire hydrant and destroyed my wife\u2019s personal appearance, MIL thought she was high because of it and now wife is banned from her house until she goes to rehab\n\nEdit: fixed the TL;DR because apparently my previous one broke the Geneva convention. Lots of people are asking what the supplement is (seriously, I\u2019ve gotten 100+ messages about dick pills, wtf reddit)- [this guy](https://old.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/nrou10/tifu_by_taking_a_load_boosting_supplement_and/h0i05qs/) caught me and put two and two together.

            "Infinite Cum\n\nInfinite cum. You sit on the toilet to jack off, but you begin to cum uncontrollably. After ten spurts you start to worry. Your hand is sticky and it reeks of semen. You desperately shove your dick into a wad of toilet paper, but that only makes your balls hurt. The cum accelerates. It\u2019s been three minutes. You can\u2019t stop cumming. Your bathroom floor is covered in a thin layer of baby fluid. You try to cum into the shower drain but it builds up too fast. You try the toilet. The cum is too thick to be flushed. You lock the bathroom door to prevent the cum from escaping. The air grows hot and humid from the cum. The cum accelerates. You slip and fall in your own sperm. The cum is now six inches deep, almost as long as your still-erect semen hose. Sprawled on your back, you begin to cum all over the ceiling. Globs of the sticky white fluid begin to fall like raindrops, giving you a facial with your own cum. The cum accelerates. You struggle to stand as the force of the cum begins to propel you backwards as if you were on a bukkake themed slip-and-slide.  Still on your knees, the cum is now at chin height. To avoid drowning you open the bathroom door. The deluge of man juice reminds you of the Great Molasses Flood of 1919, only with cum instead of molasses. The cum accelerates. It\u2019s been two hours. Your children and wife scream in terror as their bodies are engulfed by the snow-white sludge. Your youngest child goes under, with viscous bubbles and muffled cries rising from the goop. You plead to God to end your suffering. The cum accelerates. You squeeze your dick to stop the cum, but it begins to leak out of your asshole instead. You let go. The force of the cum tears your urethra open, leaving only a gaping hole in your crotch that spews semen. Your body picks up speed as it slides backwards along the cum. You smash through the wall, hurtling into the sky at thirty miles an hour. From a bird\u2019s eye view you see your house is completely white. Your neighbor calls the cops. The cum accelerates. As you continue to ascend, you spot police cars racing towards your house. The cops pull out their guns and take aim, but stray loads of cum hit them in the eyes, blinding them. The cum accelerates. You are now at an altitude of 1000 feet. The SWAT team arrives. Military helicopters circle you. Hundreds of bullets pierce your body at once, yet you stay conscious. Your testicles have now grown into a substitute brain. The cum accelerates. It has been two days. With your body now destroyed, the cum begins to spray in all directions. You break the sound barrier. The government deploys fighter jets to chase you down, but the impact of your cum sends one plane crashing to the ground. The government decides to let you leave the earth. You feel your gonads start to burn up as you reach the edges of the atmosphere. You narrowly miss the ISS, giving it a new white paint job as you fly past. Physicists struggle to calculate your erratic trajectory. The cum accelerates. The cum begins to gravitate towards itself, forming a comet trail of semen. Astronomers begin calling you the \u201cCummet.\u201d You are stuck in space forever, stripped of your body and senses, forced to endure an eternity of cumshots. Eventually, you stop thinking.",

        "selftext": "Short but sweet, obligatory TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nI (F 34) was on my way back home from work, passing by the local grocery store and supermarket, located very close to my home.There are normally lots of stray cats in the neighborhood, but there is one in particular that always comes running when she sees me, so even when I am loaded with shopping bags, I can't help myself petting her.Today was no exception. I made sure to pet her only with the left hand, because I knew I wouldn't be able to wash my hands immediately (love her but she is kinda dingy), so to avoid touching my face or hair (as I often do), I was trying to do everything with my right hand.\n\nSo I go to the supermarket next, already on the cash register, unloading my basket and chit-chatting with the boy who works it (he looks to be in his early 20's, kinda cute), like I normally do.While I'm helping him arrange all items in my bag, I followed his gaze and noticed the questioning look he gave my left hand, as it must have appeared quite weird that I wouldn't use it, and instead hold it aside, like a surgeon ready to operate.Me being the kind of person who feels the need to explain any misunderstandings away (because God forbid somebody thinks something weird about me, lol) chirp up casually:-Oh, I just stroke a kitty with that hand, so I try not to touch anything else before I wash my hands properly.Mind you, I said that in my native language, where the word for kitty and the euphemism are interchangeable, like *p.u.s.s.y* in English.\n\nHe stopped scanning the groceries for a moment and when I looked at him, he had this priceless expression on his face.... Eyes a little wide, sort of flushed, looking at me in disbelief.Only then did it hit me what I said and how it must have sounded to him.I quickly corrected myself, elaborating saying:-Kitty. Cat, you know. A stray. Meow meow. (Yes, I really said that....\\*cringe\\*)\n\nHe made an \"Oooooh...\" sound and bit his lips suppressing a burst of laughter.\n\nI think I might shop elsewhere in the next few days... \\*facepalm\\*\n\nTL;DR: I accidentally woke somebody's dirty mind by making him think I've pet my kitty...\n\n**EDIT**: Thank you so much for the platinum and silver, I just wanted to vent by sharing a mildly cringe-worthy story from my day with a healthy dose of self-irony. \n\nI didn't expect it to blow out like it did.   \nI appreciate all the kind and funny comments, BUT I'm also shocked to see how far could some people twist my words into extremely dark connotations - I even saw comments about me being creepy, predatory etc, which is absurd.  \nI know I shouldn't \"feed the trolls\" by engaging and reasoning, what reasoning when somebody posts an absurd comment meant solely to upset or offend, indeed.  \nBut seriously, those who suggested I was in any way deliberately inappropriate or had some hidden lewd agenda towards this guy - I suggest you read my post again carefully and then if you still think so, seek some professional help, because the issue is with you, not with me.",

This led to me struggling through exchanges at cafes all over town. One morning, I tried to order a croissant with my espresso. My knowledge being limited, I mixed up two very basic verbs and said \u201cI am\u201d instead of \u201cI want\u201d. This would have been okay but I finished with \u201cun cornuto\u201d, instead of \u201cun cornetto\u201d (croissant). So instead of asking for a pastry, I told the barista that my wife is cheating on me... the stunned silence and looks of surprise only lasted a minute before the whole place burst into laughter when everyone realized what I meant to say. Once they kindly explained it, I was laughing with them. Didn\u2019t pay for my croissant that day, made new friends AND I learned a fun new Italian word!",

At this place, as with most fast food restaurants, they have the cups for the drinks  in a tube that contains a long stack and they just pull one out of the bottom.  Now, for whatever reason I just randomly forget words.  English is my native language, I have no excuse, been that way my whole life.  I forgot the word \"cup\", so I said \"You forgot...\"  and then I did a hand gesture meant to imitate the act of getting the drink from the stack.  It apparently looked like another gesture.  The kid at the register turned bright red and looked shocked.  There were several moments where we were both mortified before I finally located the word \"cup\".

For it to actually pay off will take more years, more luck, and require you to stick around at underpaid levels until the company is bought or dies.\n\nAlso \"for free until funded\"-  never do that.

The profile was ambiguous, just a picture of her laying down on her belly, no bio. I usually start with a creative message derived from the pictures or bio. [I decided to just message her, \"I don't have much to go off from your profile. What does come to mind is that you have a nice looking butt\" She responds, \"Wanna touch my butt in perosn\"](https://imgur.com/a/x6cAs3V) You can read the rest of the conversation from that Imgur link. Bottom line is, we decided to meet at my apartment and that I would give her $40 for some weed.\n\nThis felt like a whole new level of trashy for me. So far in life, I have only had sex with four people, and I make a serious attempt to date them. I asked my friends what I should do, they said it did not seem too sketch. I was going to say no, until I thought to myself, *\"Hey dude, when you are an old man, you will regret not having casual sex with a stranger more than not knowing what could have been.\"*\n\nI end up giving her my number and she calls me. There were a few things over the phone that gave me a bad feeling. First, she sounded *way* too casual over the phone. It felt like I was scheduling an appointment with a receptionist. Second, she thought that we were doing this at her place. I asked her if she had roommates, and she responded yes. I told her that it made more sense to do this at my place since I live alone. She ends up hanging up. I am thinking, *\"Alright, whatever this all seemed too good to be true anyways.\"* She calls back 3 minutes later saying that she lost cell phone reception for a minute. This was the final item to make me feel uneasy. In hindsight she was obviously lying. The amount of time between calls was far too long for her to have just lost connection.\n\nShe agreed to do this at my place. I insisted that we get coffee first so I can make sure I am not bringing a wacko into my apartment. She agreed to that and I am feeling more comfortable now. She just asks for a ride, which was not a problem for me.\n\nI leave to pick her up and get $40 for the bud. Up to this point, I was feeling really nervous about going through with this. Then, while I am actually going through with it, all those thoughts disappeared. I am just thinking to myself, *\"Tonight is going to be fun! I am about to get a little high with a cute girl, play some Mario Kart with her, 'watch Netflix', get my dick wet, and maybe even... cuddle?\"*\n\nLittle did I know, I am about to get majorly bamboozled. The address she gave me was not listed. I call her, she says just to meet her at the Rite Aid on the corner. This is when I should have known to back out. However, at this point, I am dead set on eating pussy. I meet her at the Rite Aid parking lot. She actually looks like her profile and all the nerves are gone again. She said we could expect her dealer to show up any minute. She gets the call 2 minutes later. I am thinking to myself, *\"What kind of drug dealer is this prompt?\"* but me being a gullible idiot, I give her my $40 anyways.\n\nThen she meets some dude on the corner and they walk off together, not to be seen again. I immediately realize that I have been played. She texts me, \"Ur beat sorry\" and that was that.\n\nWas I mad? No, not at all. The situation could have been far worse. It could have been more money. She could have been an undercover cop. She could have been lying about her age. I could have been beat up by her boyfriend. I could have gotten an STD. The list goes on folks.\n\nRight now, I feel three things. I feel great shame, this is not the guy I am. I am just lonely and would have appreciated some sexual comfort. I also feel really bad for her. She must be in a tight spot to have gone through with that. I am sure that she needs my $40 more than I do. Finally, I feel really unlucky, as yesterday was my cake day. If this could have happened just one day earlier, my post would have been gilded *for sure*.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, what did we learn today? If a situation seems too good to be true, it is.\n\ntl;dr I met a girl on Tinder who just wanted to get high and fuck. I give her the money for the weed and she just walks off with it.\n\nEdit: Just woke up, will try to respond some of you throughout the day. Thanks for all the comments and to whoever it was that gave gold! I know, I am an idiot. I don\u2019t mind being the *butt* of a joke though because you people are absolutely hilarious!",

            "Dude youre lucky thats all that happened.\n\nI had a chick facebook message me wanting to smoke some green and fuck. I had maybe a hitters worth left and thats all. She wanted me to park on a certain part of the road near a local park. She was out there waiting and told me she wanted to walk through the back door of her house so her family doesnt notice. As we got to the back of her house two dudes jumped out and beat the shit out of me. One of them had me in a stranglehold and demanded I take everything out of my pockets. They stole my wallet, phone, keys, and the little bit of weed I had on me. One dude said if I ever talked to his girlfriend again hed kill me. They then beat me some more and all ran off. \n\nHad the neighbors call the cops and few weeks later I managed to recognize her and her boyfriend at my work. Picked him out of a lineup and he got charged for felony theft. Got some jailtime and had to pay me $1,200 for everything they stole.\n\nThe girl didnt get in any trouble at all even afer showing them the facebook messages of her trying to sell me cocaine and heroin.",

        "selftext": "So this happened 8 years ago when I was 12yo. (First reddit post, that\u2019s why story took so long to tell.) \n\nAt the time I lived in Moscow, Russia with my family, im swedish but my father worked at the embassy in Moscow. I was always fucking/playing around as a young lad. While in Moscow we lived in a quite pompous neighberhood with mostly other diplomats as well as russian businessman who often are pretty shady (as yall know).\n\nAfter school me and my best friend always used to hang out. I lived in an apartment in a big tower of a building. On every level there were two apartments and with that two doors. I lived on something like the 4-5 floor so I always took the elevator. Me and my friend one day ended up on the highest floor while being annoying and pressing all of the buttons in the elevator. That floor was being renovated, it was covered in plastic and overall looking kinda abandonned. The floor gave off a creepy feeling. As on all levels there were two doors. In Russia it is common that you have quite pompous doors with patterns and different materials. Rich people would flex not only with cars but also with doors. One of these two doors at the top of the building was hella pimped out. \n\nThe door was gray with buttons and made out of a fluffy pillowlike soft material, how I know it was soft? Well we felt on it. Me and my friend not only felt on it, because of its\u2019 texture and the fact that we thought the apartment to be abondonned (yep) we made it a tradition to everytime we took the elevator to my flat first visit THE DOOR to pet it.\n\nThis tradition continued for a couple of weeks and one day we were hanging out at my place after petting the door when my father called on me. When I came to him he was standing at the door that was occupied by two big russian men armed with handguns. They started talking in russian which already normally sounds like an angry language. They looked hella scary with guns and they were both looking at me dead in the eyes while basically screaming. I had no idea what was going on (I spoke very little russian) until my father asked if I had been at the top floor doing suspicious stuff. \n\nThat was when I realized my fuck up. The russian body guards (my father told me they said that they introduced themselves as BGs) continued to lecture me for a while and my father looked quite amused. Then suddenly one of them started smiling and said something like \u201dgood boy\u201d in english before leaving. I stopped shitting my pants and asked my father what they said. He explained that they had seen me and my friend day after day walking up to THE DOOR and petting it in their surveillance system. I believe these body guards to work for some big time russian buisnessman perhaps even a criminal. I do not see why they would be armed otherwise. I can not with certainty say that they were gangsters but that would be my guess.\n\nThis incident was scary at the time but is a very fond memory from Russia today. I never petted THE DOOR again. Actually I have not petted a door since.\n\nTL;DR\n12 YO me petted neighbors door in Russia and got visit from armed gangster body guards.\n\n(Written on IPhone)",

My mum bought it me for Christmas last year and it was my absolute favourite item of clothing.\n\nLast night I went out with my mates and happened to meet an attractive Spanish girl who was just in Manchester for the weekend. We chatted for a bit and made out in the club smoking area as one does, then after a while she complained about the cold English weather. I predictably offered her my precious hoodie at this point. Fast forward a few hours and we exchange contact details as we planned to meet the next day to hang out, then she leaves the club. I realise she's still wearing the hoodie so run after her and ask for it back. \n\nThis is where I make my fatal error, a fine example of thinking with your genitals instead of your head. I had the smart idea that if I let her keep the hoodie for the night, itll mean she HAS to meet me the next day and can't back out thus allowing me more time to charm her. I essentially used the jumper as fishing bait but didn't think that the fish could just eat said bait and swim away. *spoiler alert* This is what happened. \n\nThe next day I awoke excited to spend some time with this girl and waited patiently for her to reply to my messages so we could arrange to meet. By 5 in the evening I start to get worried and message her again as well as asking her friend to reply to me. My messages get left 'seen' for about an hour before they both block me on all social media platforms shooting in the head any chance of me seeing my beautiful jumper ever again. \n\nTo the Spanish girl who stomped on a nice gesture and on my heart, know that you have made me sad. \n\nRest In Peace sweet banana coloured hoodie x\n\nTL;DR Lent a hot girl my best jumper in an attempt to guarantee more courtship time, girl steals hoodie\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the support guys this is pretty insane, also thanks for the gold and silver! To everyone offering to buy me a new one, thanks for being so kind and thoughtful but I'll have to politely decline. It would be too weird for me haha but if theres anyone in the UK that has one lying around that theyd maybe sell give me a message! x",

One month here, two months over there, etc.\n\nOne winter, the only job available was in a place with constant snow for the duration of the job. I had already occasionally worked in cold weather, and had bought two $20 thinsulate knit caps (one for laundry). You can find knit caps for $5 out of polyester, but the thinsulate is warmer, and when I came indoors, it was not bulky, so it fit easily into a pocket.\n\nOne guy didn't bring a knit cap, and his ball cap was not very warm. I offered my spare, but told him he had to buy his own next day off, and he agreed. We worked six days with one day off each week. Of course, he didn't buy one, and Monday claimed he forgot. I told him it was fine, just pay me $20, and you can keep it. He acted shocked (as some people do at a $20 knit cap), and he said, just give me six more days (we worked 12-hour shifts, job was 24-hrs).\n\nNext Monday \"he forgot\" again. I had noticed other ways in which this guy was slimy, and realized since we were making good pay, he figured I would eventually give in. Next day off, I bought a $2 knit cap from a thrift store, and made sure it was the bulky polyester.\n\nMonday came, and at start of shift I walked behind him and pulled the cap off him in front of everyone. The rest of the crew knew what he was doing. When he spun around to protest, I handed him the cheap knit cap and loudly said \"I got this for you as a gift\".\n\nSome guys would never have loaned him a cap. Other would have kicked his ass after one week, and told him to freeze like a little bitch. I don't know what I should have done, but The pay was too good to ruin a good thing. Live and learn. ",

            "I was 15 at a summer camp in California when I met this awesome, beautiful girl from Taiwan. We only had a few weeks together but, as teenagers do, we quickly fell \"in love.\" I lent her my favorite flannel, and she began to wear it every day. She loved it more than I did. I told her if she wanted to bring it back to Taiwan she could. \n\nSo the summer camp came to an end, I went back to New Hampshire, and she went home. Of course, as angsty teens do, we attempted to have a long distance relationship. After about 2 months, we broke up amicably, and I knew then that my flannel was gone...\n\nLast June, however, she came to Boston for another summer camp, the city where I now go to college. We agreed to meet up for a day so I could show her around the city a bit. Can you guess what happened next? SHE BROUGHT BACK MY FLANNEL. I had never been so happy to see a piece of clothing. \n\nSo for everyone out there who's had their hoodie stolen by a cold blooded woman, just know there are some good ones out there too.",

My girlfriend (26F) asked what I was rubbing and I replied, \u201cYour clit\u2026.?\u201d And in confusion she replied, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not feeling anything.\u201d  \n\nFor a second I was thrown off because how is she not feeling what I was rubbing for the past five minutes? So I poked what I thought was her clit and asked, \u201cYou mean this?\u201d And by doing that, whatever the fucked I poked, caused her to yell in pain, \u201cYes, that!\u201d \n\nIt turned out that above her hood was  this cyst that was the same size as her clit and that\u2019s what I was rubbing for the past 5 mins. Huge mood killer for the both of us, and now she\u2019s upset that she has this weird pimple that she didn\u2019t know of until now. I tried to comfort her but she\u2019s not wanting to listen.\n\nTL;DR Rubbed what I thought was my gf\u2019s clit, turned out to be a big cyst above it. FML\n\nEDIT: Turned out to be an ingrown hair, no I\u2019m not posting it on r/popping you nasties.\n\nEDIT 2: Since everyone is asking why she didn\u2019t feel it for a while, it wasn\u2019t that long of a time, like maybe a minute when she noticed it.

He was cute, tall, and had a raspy voice and British accent (my weakness), and we spent a good amount of time that night just talking and chilling. We ended up exchanging numbers before my group left. We texted pretty consistently for a few days, and planned a date (archery and drinks). When I arrived at the range and saw Max in the light of day, I knew I had made a mistake. Upside: He was actually even cuter than I remembered. Downside: He was most definitely a she (the boobs were unmistakable in her top), albeit pretty androgynous. After a bit of convo, I confirmed that she definitely identified as a female and a lesbian. I explained that I was straight, and thought she was a guy, and she luckily laughed it off (apparently it\u2019s happened before). We still ended up finishing up our date, and had a great time; we\u2019ve hung out multiple times since then. I have since introduced her to a friend who\u2019s actually a lesbian, and they really hit it off, and have been on a few dates. My friends have been roasting me for weeks, but I gained a friend and my friend gained a potential girlfriend, so really can\u2019t complain.\n\nTL;DR: I accidentally went on a date with an androgynous lesbian after meeting her in a poorly-lit club, thinking she was a guy.\n\n*Edit 1: Thank you for the awards and kind comments!

I worked for a huge summer camp and they would sometimes put on weekend events for the hundreds of staff members that stayed on-camp for the whole summer. On one such weekend beach-trip, I was chilling on my towel with a book and a cute guy recognized what I was reading and sat down to talk to me about it and we ended up chatting (flirting) til it was time to leave. And then we both stood up and this look of total dismay came over his face. I'm a tall gal (not freakishly tall, but well above average) and the dude was a full foot shorter than me. Before I could say anything, he mumbled his excuses and disappeared into the crowd of people loading onto busses. What sucks is I'm not really hung up on height differences and years later ended up marrying a guy who's shorter than me.

By using the be same number every time I am consistent if I'm \"already in the system\".  I've been using this number for about 10 years everywhere from JCPenney to Best Buy to financial services, etc.\n\nYesterday I got a new client and he had the same number I've been using as my \"fake number\".  I tried my best not to show any emotion to hearing it but I asked him how long he's had that number.  He said \"Oh, about 15 years, but I may get a new one because I get non-stop telemarketing calls.\"  I told him, \"I get some once in awhile too. Aren't they annoying *haha*\"\n\nHe says, \"Yeah, I think maybe someone is giving out my number because they keep asking if {my first name} is available.\"\n\nI said, \"That happens to me from time to time as well, people think I'm {old homeowner's name} or {bosses name}. Oh well. Email me if you change your number.\"\n\nHe says \"I will. Actually they ask for **you** pretty much all the time. What's your number? I bet they are getting us confused.  It seems strange almost all of them ask for you even thought we're not related\".\n\nI gave him my work number.\n\n**tl;dr: i've been giving out a fake number and met the guy who actually has that number in real life and he gets telemarketing calls non-stop because of it.**\n\n.\n.\nEdit: So tonight I had a meeting at the guy's office to go over a proposal. I spent too much time reading comments this afternoon (and felt bad) and I told him my personal number was one digit off from his.  So he says, \"Yeah I figured everyone had misdialed for the last few years or this might have been your old number.\" He knew right away when he saw my name...\n\nSo, I never told him I had given every company on Earth his number (not knowing it was him) but I did tell him i gave the wrong number at Guitar Center a few times. Dont ask me why I came clean for one place but not the rest of them. He laughed it off.\n\nSo, I've learned not to give any more fake numbers and I did bring the guy a gift card to Longhorn Steakhouse as 'thanks and take your wife out to dinner\" when in reality I felt bad because I didn't think through my actions and many of you called me out.",

It was just a way for us to have all of your transactions on file, for example, if you lost your receipt and wanted to return something, we could look up your transaction with your phone number so you could get  the refund back onto your debit/credit card rather than store credit. Or, if customers left personal belongings in the store, we could look up your phone number to call you and let you know that you left whatever it was at the store (this happened ALL the time.) I also know that bigger retail stores have reward cards that are connected to your phone number, which is why they ask for it. \n\nIf you're worried about spam, I would be more selective in giving out your email rather than phone number (at least from a retail perspective.) This is the modern spam medium nowadays. Even then I will usually give out an old email that I never check.

The sex worker my dad hired to terminate my virginity in the dead of night did not keep her mouth shut. I know. I should've seen it coming. When I shared my original post, I was convinced my dad didn't know I was gay. I never said anything to anyone about my sexuality other than to the sex worker who teamed up with my father to unexpectedly put me in a vulnerable position. My dad and I have been avoiding each other since that night. Not gonna lie, I was okay with that. We needed space. The words divorced dad, virgin son and sex worker should never be said in the same sentence. \n\nThis morning my dad showed up at my apartment. Unusual but not surprising. He was courteous enough to call beforehand. Asked if I was available. Said he wanted to talk. I assumed he was still feeling bad about ambushing me with a sex worker and wanted to make sure that our relationship was intact. Little did I know that my dad's primary objective was to establish if his 20 year old son was sexually attracted to other people's 20 year old sons. As soon as my dad made himself at home in my living room, he asked if we were alone. I said my roommate was at the gym. My dad's response was to drop the following line: \"sharing an apartment with a guy who works out must be motivating.\" Slow clap. Subtle as fuck, my father. He didn't even need to wink at the camera. \n\nMy dad asked if my roommate had a gf. I implied that he had girls that come and go. My dad said my roommate must be handsome to get so much attention. I shrugged and said \"or he's paying for it.\" It was a joke. An uncomfortable joke based on my dad's disturbed expression. My dad said he could explain the sex workers and answer all my questions if was prepared to listen. I said it was none of my business and he didn't owe me an explanation, but I did suggest that he at least considered therapy. My dad said he was proud of the person I've become and promised to think about my suggestion. As wholesome as that moment was, the gay elephant was still in the room, so I awkwardly asked my dad if he recently communicated with the sex worker he hired to sleep with me. \n\nMy dad said no because he wanted to respect my privacy and avoid crossing the line again. Based on all the random references to my roommate's attractiveness, I was convinced my dad heard I was gay from one of the other sex workers, who heard it from the sex worker with the motormouth. We danced around the topic of my sexuality for a little longer because it was still a big moment despite all the weird shit that happened the last time my dad and I were under the same roof. I eventually came out and said it. \"Dad, I'm gay.\" My dad stood up and showed me he was wearing socks with rainbow stripes to celebrate the news. I didn't even notice his socks until he lifed the leg opening of his pants. He said it was a gift from the sex workers. He had another pair of rainbow socks in his pocket, which he gave to me when we were done hugging. \n\nI suppose the outcome could've been worse. I doubt there will be another update, so thank you for riding this wave with me. \n\nTL:DR An update post, not really a fuck up. I informed a sex worker with a motormouth that I was gay and expected her to keep that information private. She spread the news amongst her fellow sex workers who eventually shared it with one of their loyal clients, which happened to be my dad.",

        "selftext": "Well brethren, I too wanted to partake in the great Coconutting frenzy. Today was my day off and was also my wifes longest day of work. It should be mentioned shes on her period, and sex is out of the picture for her. I havent busted a nut in roughly 4 days, and the idea of penetrating a milky coconut somehow thrilled me after reading the whole coconut-fucking-bonanza today.\n\nI went to the store, got a coconut and a bottle of wine to set the mood. After getting home, I uncorked the wine to get my buzz on and proceeded to open the coconut via hammer and nail. Once the hole was set into place, I expanded it apropriately to fit my member by using some of the untensils int he kitchen. Once I got a good fit after doing a \"test run\" I found the hairs to be a little too much. I shaved her in the bathroom using my wahl clippers. The preparations were made, the mood was set, and I opened up a pack of condoms and went to work on my new bitch.\n\nFast foward a few hours later, and my wife comes home. All is well, we ate dinner and talked, usual bullshit. I knew I fucked up when she confronted me with the condom wrappers I had used. Aparently she found them in the trash can and freaked the fuck out asking who was over.. I told her I cheated on her with a coconut. .. It took a lot of convincing and showing of reddit threads to prove I didn't have anyone else over and I simply needed a good couple of fap sessions alone. She was furious and I tried to console her by saying I'd never cheat on her with anyone..Just was having a hard time due to her time of the month and it seemed like a good idea. I'm not allowed to buy cocounuts anymore :/\n\nTL;DR : Fucked my coconut with a condom, wife found them thought I was cheating on her, had to fess up.\n\n",

As I'm not one of the guys, I simply sit back and chart while half listening out for anything they may need me to get. Which I don't mind at all because I'm insanely quiet by nature. \n\nOften with cases that last longer than an hour, we insert catheters to make sure the patient is producing urine still, and that they hadn't nicked the urinary system. The collection bag is hung at the foot of the table for easy access, to assess the output.\n\nSo, I'm charting halfway into the case and all of the sudden out of the corner of my eye I see the surgeon turn toward me and he says \"You're a skier!?\" I was totally caught off guard cause he never converses with women, at least who aren't doctors. \n\nI momentarily stared at him, trying to figure out how he knew I was a skier and why he would ask me that.  I then proceeded to talk about how why yes I love to ski and I've been here and there. Used to snowboard but switched back to skiing. And so on. Then I pause and realize everyone in the room was just staring at me. \n\nThe surgeon then with his super heavy South American accent then sternly repeats himself and says \"Urine's clear??\" \n\nI just about lost it. I said something like \"oh!\" Then ran to the bag to check and said yeah it's clear. \n\nI had to leave the room because I couldn't contain myself. I was crying. When I finally put on my straight face and reenterd, the surgeon goes \"So what else do you do?\" They had a good laugh. \n\nIt was super embarrassing and hysterical and it actually made him acknowledge me from then on. \n\n\nTL;DR\n\nDuring surgery, thought the surgeon asked me about my skiing hobby,  when he really asked if the urine was clear.\n\n\nEdit: I'm happily surprised so many of you appreciated my less than perfectly written story time! And I love the stories you've shared as well.  Just to clarify, I was crying from laughter not sad crying. It's something I probably learned from my dad. I really think he should post his stories on here. Also, the surgeon is from a South American country...his accent is so thick that if I'm walking by, I have to try really hard to figure out if he's speaking Spanish or English. That plus masks on top...things can get funny. Especially since he's such a serious character normally.

So she raised his gown, moved her hand to find and grab his penis and testicle, moved it all around, checked very closely and suddenly\u00a0the\u00a0man\u00a0ej***ated\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0nurse\u2019s hand.

When I was younger I was working at a public health nonprofit and it was very international - our focus took us to a lot of developing nations and to be effective we'd have a staff person with ties to these countries oversee these areas. The woman who was running the Latin America program was lovely and had this beautiful accent. I remember my first week, sitting in the senior leadership meeting to take notes and thinking like I was crushing it. And the woman from Latin America kept talking about this issue with \"watermelon\" tobacco control and I thought \"huh, interesting...that's very specific flavored tobacco to be having a problem with but ok, learning new things!\". So I finish the meeting and circulate my notes for everyone to review and then hear just resounding snickers and giggles....it was not watermelon tobacco control but Guatemalan tobacco control. Which made SO much more sense. I was so embarrassed, while everyone was nice I swear she really overpronounced Guatemala after that like forever.",

        "selftext": "So this actually happened a few weeks ago. I just moved to the suburbs of New Jersey from Philadelphia a few months ago. I was at a friends house for a zoom baby shower and I ended up staying all day and playing video games and eating dinner. My boyfriend met me there later on to hang out and parked next to me in the driveway. They live on the entrance to a cul-de-sac.\n\nWe were getting ready to leave around 12:30 AM and my phone had died so I figured I would back out behind him and follow him home since I am new to the area. I pulled out extra wide to give him space and I did not see a dark blue car parked behind their driveway (it was pretty hazy/foggy that night) and I scratched the side of the car with my tail light. Minimal body damage was done to the door, a few scratches, a little bit of paint from my car. I got out of my car, immediately wrote a note with my information on it, and decided to go home so I could charge my phone and call my insurance.\n\nI got home and immediately called my insurance and they requested I upload a copy of the police report. Ok, ill call the police, let them know what happened, shouldn't be a big deal, this happens all the time right? wrong. The cop told me he was going to charge me with a hit and run. He accused me of being drunk (I was not at all). I offered to meet him at the station, at the scene of the accident, at my house. He refused to meet me anywhere he told me it was \"too late I had already made the wrong choice and he was forced to charge me\" I started to drive back to the \"scene of the accident\" and he told me on the phone to pull over and immediately send him all of my information in an email. I complied with everything he told me to do. He told me he was going to the residence of the people who's car I hit to notify them and that they were \"probably going to want to press charges against me\".\n\nI told him to call me back after he got done there. He never did. The next day I was able to get in touch with the neighbor who was awesome. She was super understanding and if anything was just mad the cop showed up at her house at 1 AM. She told me he said \"we are forced to charge her since she left the scene\" and the neighbor replied \"she left a note, anyone would have done that, its 1 AM, this is not necessary\" and at that point he urged them to press charges on me because I \"could have been drunk and am old enough to know better\".\n\nA week goes by and I hear nothing from the officer. The car is in the shop getting fixed and my insurance is paying for it. The neighbors have no intent of pressing any charges against me. I send the neighbors a basket filled with milkbar cookies for causing them any trouble. Yesterday I get a ticket in the mail for \"leaving the scene of an accident\" with a mandatory court appearance and I just hired a very expensive lawyer. I work in sales and have a company car I have to drive for work. My lawyer wanted to know how the police even got involved, to which I replied \"I called them\". I called the cops on myself. Now I have to pay a lot of money to get it fixed. I could lose my job over a bad driving record. so yeah, TIFU.\n\n\nTL;DR - accidentally scratched a car, thought i did the right thing, might lose my license for 6 months\n\n&",

            "From what I can tell, at sites dealing with this (like https://www.njticketattorneys.com/leaving-the-scene-non-injury-accident-njsa-394-129b/), what you did (leaving your info) was _exactly_ what they say to do. So I am not sure I understand what the cop is objecting to - you left your name and insurance info and then within a reasonable amount of time reported it.  No injuries were possible (it was unoccupied, after all).  \n\nHopefully your attorney is able to get you off, but sounds like it\u2019ll cost you plenty anyway even though you\u2019re not in the wrong.",
            "Hopefully that judge heat tells the cop to GTFO of his court.",
            "Yeah, it's not \"hit and run\" or \"leaving the scene of an accident\" if you leave your contact info on an unattended vehicle.\n\nThe cop is an ass, and with an attorney the worst case scenario is a $200 fine and two points on your driving record.  With having left the note and contacting the police department yourself the same evening, there really isn't a case.",

If the driver damages property other than a car, he must notify the nearest police station, as well as the owner of the property as soon as the owner is identified.",
            "Your lawyer probably already told you this/is doing this but if you can, I would ask (the seemingly very nice car owners) to either write a statement or call the prosecutor\u2019s office to say they don\u2019t want to prosecute and that you left a note with your info. If they still have the note, I would also ask them to take a picture and send it to you so your lawyer can provide it to the prosecutor\u2019s office. Furthermore, I would see if you can get any records from your insurance showing that you called it in and have paid for the damages to both vehicles. As someone who has actually prosecuted LSOA cases, the prosecutors should dismiss this or at the very least offer a diversion program that results in a dismissal if you take a defensive driving course and do some community service hours.",
            "In small towns the cops act like the one in your situation did. They act like everyone is a drunk driver. They don't realize that in cities this happens all the time and that's how people handle it because cops just don't have time for small minor fender benders. In a small town you can get into a lot of trouble leaving \"the scene of an accident\" they treat it like it's the scene of a freaking murder. I've never understood this.",
            "Sorry that happened to you. In most EU countries you do not need to get the police involved in minor collisions assuming all parties are being honest about what happened.

            "25 years ago I was living in Colorado (I was from there). I had just finished my last shift delivering pizzas (yay). I drove out of the parking lot and drove straight across to the road that was directly opposite the exit. I was in a hurry to get home as I had an early flight the next morning and was immigrating to Australia, however, I was not speeding. Four blocks from the intersection all of a sudden there were flashing lights in my rear view window. I pulled over and waited for the police officer to tell me why I was being pulled over. I should say that I had a perfect driving record. I had driven in 4 different countries other than the US without a blemish on my record. \nThe officer asked me if I was aware that the intersection I had driven through was right turn only? I wasn\u2019t aware of that but was apologetic. I explained that I must have missed the sign as I was in a hurry to get home due to my early flight and that I was looking forward to seeing my fianc\u00e9e whom I hadn\u2019t seen in 3 months (we were getting married 2 weeks after I arrived in Australia). I also asked if this was a new rule as I had seen multiple cars (including police) driving across this intersection for years. I did not admit that I had done so on several occasions.\nThe officer did not respond to my statement. I asked if there was anyway the could let me off with a warning as I would not be driving in Colorado for the foreseeable future. \nThe officers response to this was to give me a ticket for driving in a dangerous manner and disobeying a road sign. He then stated that I had to personally appear before the judge in 30 days time to answer for my offence. When I reiterated that I was immigrating to another country the next day, he told me that if I did not appear a bench warrant would be issued for my arrest.\nI flew out the next day as scheduled. My Dad took the ticket to the courthouse after he dropped me at the airport, explained the situation and paid a $150 fine. Was told that I had lost 6 points off my license (big whoop) and that was that. My license expired years ago, I haven\u2019t bothered to renew it as I have lived in Australia for 25 years and will soon celebrate my 25th wedding anniversary.",

They have their own motive, whether it be money, meeting quota, going off on a power trip, blowing off some steam, or prejudice of some kind. \n\nI'll never forget going to my local pub after work about 5 years ago and getting a drink to watch the game. Little did I know the bar was allowing underage drinking and these rich trust funder high schoolers were drinking in the backroom, before eventually leaving to go clubbing down town.\n\nAbout 5 minutes after the kids left, a group of 5 punky looking guys dressed in jeans and t-shirts entered the bar and started staring me down like they wanted to fight me. It was weird and unnerving, as I didn't know any of them.  And I was ready to fight, as this went on for 10 minutes till one of them got directly in my face, staring me down, still absolutely no words spoken. Suddenly, one of the guys in the group pushed the bartender, flashed a badge, told him he was under arrest. Turns out, they were under cover cops and shutting the bar down for allowing under age drinking.\n\nNow, I get the cops were doing their job and have no problem shutting down a bar for serving minors. But why, out of 20 other people sitting at the bar, they chose to try to intimidate me into a fight is unnerving. I had no clue these guys were cops, just thought they were punks, which is how they acted. I work out a lot and have a bodybuilder build, so I get that dudes get competitive with me all the time, but this was completely something else. Had I reacted the wrong way, I would've been arrested and thrown in the van like the bartender. And the cop in my face confirmed this as he walked out the door, by saying with a wise ass grin, \"too bad you didn't throw a punch at me.\" \n\nWTF?!!! I used to respect cops, but now after having or seeing so many questionable enounters with them, I don't trust them one bit. Sorry to say this, but I don't trust them at all.

        "selftext": "So like the title said I fucked up (it was after midnight so technicly today) by having my period and getting drunk.\nIf your one of those guys who nearly faints when someone mentions the word period, this post aint for you, It will fuck up your life.\n\nMy son\u2019s birthday was yesterday, so I\u2019ve been running around all day catering everybody and making sure the kids don\u2019t break anything/eachother. Somewhere around noon I noticed my period got heavy and I put in a tampon, and went back to my guests.\n\nAround 7 o\u2019clock everyone left except my husband\u2019s best friend, I put the kids to bed and started to relax. I\u2019ve had a wine or 2 during the day, and now with my kids in bed I treated myself to a glass of wine, and during the evening my husband and I got pretty wasted (which for my was kinda easy cos I hadnt had a drink in like 2 weeks). \nAround 11 my husband went to bed because he got tired and pretty bored with me and his friend because we where talking about games, watching trailers, that kind of stuff. And since I\u2019ve got no gamer friends I had a good time, getting drunker by the minute. Around 00.30 husbands friend decides to go home. \n\nThis is where my FU begins.\n\nI was pretty drunk, and drunk me tought sexytime with husband was a good idea (cos let\u2019s face it, drunk sexytime is the best sexytime). But then I realised I still had my tampon in, so I had to get it out (also because it\u2019s dangerous to have it in for as long as I unknowingly had, but most because of my desired sexytime). \n\nI went to the toilet, ready to pull it out, when I realised I couldnt \u201cfind\u201d it, or the string. After some fumbling around I could feel al little bit of the string, alllllll the way tucked in. I spend about 15 minutes grabbing the string, trying to pull it out, only to feel like it was stuck, and I couldnt get a good grip at it. \nI was getting annoyed at this point, fingering myself on the toilet in search of The Lost Tampon wasn\u2019t the kind of sexytime I had in mind. \n\nI decided to call the HAP (I live in Holland, here we dont go to the ER for everything, we go to out \u201chomedoctor\u201d for small things like a cold, bump on the head, vaccinations, deep cut and so on. But outside working hours there is the HAP which is like the on duty doctor/ nurse for like 50 doctors in the area). \n\nTrying to sound kinda sober I explained the nurse my problem, she was kind but firm, If I didnt get the fucker out in an hour, I had to come by and they would extract it. If I would wait till morning I would have it in for 20 hours and that is dangerous.  That would mean I would have to wake-up my husband not for sexytime but for I fucked up time, and we would have to get the kids out of bed.\nI wasnt gonna let that happen (primerely because Im the hilarious one in our relationship, and I wasn\u2019t ready to hear \u201cyo pussy so big, tampons get lost\u201d jokes for the rest of my life). \n\nSo before this moment I was a woman on a mission, now I was Frodo trying to get this tampon out of Sauromons grip. \n\nNurse mentioned trying to squad or take a relaxing shower. \n\nSo here I was squatting in the shower with my hand in the depths of Erebor. Still not getting good enough grip. So I take the showerhead put the waterstream on 10 and try to flush this white torpedo out. Guess what, didnt work... this goes on like 15 minutes, time is getting scarce. \n\nDecide to lean agains the wall squatting, and I finally have the string between the tips of my thumb and indexfinger. I AM NOT LETTING GO NOW! While I pull gentely I push like I\u2019m in labour, and what do you think, I finally pulled the fucker out! \n\nI felt extatic, leaned against the wall again in relieve, feeling proud about my victory.. sexytime here I come! \n\nBefore I leave to shower I decide to take a closer look at the fucker, wondering why It took longer for me to give birth to this annoying bugger than with my youngest son.\n\nI look at it, lying in the corner.. and my mind goes blank for a minute... then I scream.. I would\u2019t have flipped out more if it was the wormy thing from Alien..\n...Then the realisation kicked in.. \n\nI.PULLED.OUT.MY.FUCKING.IUD...  insert drunken hyperventilation.. OMG I pulled out my IUD.. It was just lying there in the corner like some aborted metal fishook al bloody and gross..\n\nIf you think my FU ends here.. think again.. Keep in mind it\u2019s around 2/3 o\u2019clock now.\n\nIn my panic I decide to call my mom (waking-up husband isn\u2019t nessesary annymore couse sexytime is off the table!). My father answers the phone all sleepy, and I ask for my mom. \u201cWell sweatie, we were sleeping, whatever it is, I can help you, no need to wake your mother.\u201d Okay... \n\nIWantedToHaveSexytimeWithHusbandButImHavingMyPeriodITouhgtICouldntGetMyTamponOutButNowIPulledOutMyIUD... HELPPPPP!!!!  \u201c......\u201d  Daddy?  \u201c......\u201d \u201cM. WAKE UP YOUR DAUGHTER NEEDS YOU!\u201d \n\nSo now I explained to my mother what happend and she managed to calm me down, and said I needed to call the HAP again. \nSo I did, got the same nurse, explained what happend. She consulted with her collegue, and asked me some additional questions to find out if Im ok\u00e9.. \n\n\u201cMa\u2019am, are you shivvering?\u201d Yes I am. \u201cCan you decribe how bad?\u201d Well I was in the shower, and now I\u2019m standing in my bathroom all naked and wet for like 15 minutes now, so I\u2019m getting kinda cold. \n\u201cOkay, thats a good explanation, are you dizzy ma\u2019am?\u201d Yes I am dizzy. \u201cCan you decribe how dizzy?\u201d Well I drank like a bottle of wine, thats how dizzy I am.(Muffled laughter on the other end of the phone) \u201cWell I guess thats okay also than. Are you bleeding down there?\u201d Yes I am. \u201cOkay sweety how bad is it?\u201d Well I\u2019m heaving my period, that is how bad it is.. \u201cOh yeah, I forgot, so that is normal also than.\u201d \n\nShe suggested to go to bed, and if I felt worse I could stop by, the fact that I pulled out my IUD wasn\u2019t so different than when I would get it removed by a nurse, altough she tought that that \u201cwould have happend more gently\u201d (no shit Sherlock).\n\nThere is still the mistery of The Lost Tampon.. I think drunk me pulled it out earlier at night, but I have no clue.\n\nSo for not letting go drunken sexytime, I\u2019m now not gonna have sexytime for a few weeks till I get a new IUD. And because I didn\u2019t want to hear \u201cYo pussy so big\u201d jokes, now I\u2019m gonna hear \u201cRemember when you got so drunk and horny you pulled out your IUD\u201d jokes forever. Not to mention my parents now know I like drunken sexytime.. So yeah I fucked up today..\n\nTL;DR\n\nToday I fucked up being on my period, getting drunk, and wanting sexytime. Mistake my IUD for my tampon, ripped it out after a 2 hour struggle, and woke up my parents to tell them I fucked up because I wanted to have dunken sexytime with husband. I did not get sexytime, nor will I get it for a few weeks.\n\nEdit: Wow this really blew up after I went to sleep! Glad to see my drunken efforts brought so much laughter! And its kinda nice to see al the shocked reactions, makes me feel a little less dumb for calling for my mommy in the middle of the night! \n\nSome aditional info as requested:\n\n- A IUD is a form of birtcontrol, its like a 2cm big T shaped metal thingy which is placed in your uterus, on the bottom of the T is a little string that sticks out your uterus alllll the way up your vagina, so that they can remove it. \n\n- No thank God it didnt hurt (dont know if that was the wine of the fact that I gave birth to to kids)\n\n- Yes my funzone is (apart from some trust issues) okay!\n\n- Yes I\u2019m fullt aware now that I didnt have to tell my parents I wanted sexytime, but drunken and horrified me couldnt care less at that moment.\n\n- I\u2019m 32 year old grown up mother of 2, and yes I called for my mommy\n\n- I could have asked husband to remove The Lost Tampon, but I figured after that sexytime wouldnt be an option for him, and since that was the goal I didnt ask him. (Thank God, cause this would have scarred him for life!)\n\n- As for The Lost Tampon.. I have no idea, I must have drunkenly removed it earlier.. else it still dwells in the depths of Erebor\n\nThanks for al the support, shocked reactions, compliments, laughter, silver, gold AND platinum! This made my FU a little less embarrasing!",

I felt tired and dull all day, and then I got really bad chills. I finally insisted on going to hospital when I caught sight of myself in a mirror. My lips were bloodless.\n\nMy boyfriend was still googling symptoms because he'd never heard of TSS, but I was done with having us try to diagnose me. I wanted doctors and I wanted my fears about TSS to be settled. \n\nAt hospital, it turned out that I had the flu. I went home and stayed in bed for two whole days.

When he looked at me all confused I decided to very confidently say: \n\n**I am the Vault Boy. I live underground**\n\nBless him he tried to keep a straight face cause I literally said that and started blowing him again. When I realized what I just said I laughed until I cried.

This actually happened today, about 30 minutes ago. \n\nSo I went on a tinder date with this girl last night, it was great, she's really pretty and we had a great time. We came back to her place as it was close by and ended up doing the deed multiple times and ended up in bed. Now I haven't had much action in a while and it really tired me out, so I slept like a rock.\n\nFast forward to about half an hour ago and I wake up butt naked, alone in her bed, but I can hear her downstairs in the kitchen. So I'm tossing and turning for a bit when all of a sudden this gorgeous grey floofy kitty comes and hops on the bed and starts purring like mad, I happily oblige and pet the shit out of it. I love cats. I didn't have the covers on me as it was hot and this cat felt so soft, flopping itself against my skin. \n\nSo the cat starts getting playful, hopping over my body from one side to the next, and I'm rolling side to side tickling its belly inbetween, but when I roll ove next, my schlong flips over with me, sailing through the air in a perfect arch, just before it slapped my belly the cat pounced straight onto it and dug two paws in, one on the shaft and one on the head (much like last night). I fucking screamed in agony, sat up and started trying to pull its claws out my sausage. The one on my head came off straight away but there was a claw still hanging on for dear life about halfway down which was fully lodged. The cat started to panic because it was stuck. I heard my date running upstairs and as she came in I was sat up with her cat buried in my crotch holding onto its leg trying to free it. I whimpered 'cock stuck, help' and she burst out laughing but reached over and unhooked the last claw out my shaft, leaving me naked and embarrassed. \n\nI waddled over to the bathroom with blood trickling down onto my ballsack and sat on the toilet dabbing the little holes with tissue. I'm still sat here now, with tissue pressed against my member as it write this. Going to have a shower I think.\n\ntl;dr Played with my tinder dates cat the morning after and they thought my cock was a toy, claws got stuck in multiple places now I have a sore penis.\n\nEdit: OK I've been reading a lot of comments and apparantly I should see a doctor?? How the fuck do I explain this scenario??",

Nurse here, hi, you definitely want to get seen by a doctor.\n\nCat scratch fever is only one of many things cats can carry.\n\nI've personally cared for *several* patients that have had to have amputations from infections in that area.\n\nBe proactive.\n\nEdit:\n\nCat scratch fever is just one of many bacteria that cats can carry, toxoplasmosis is another major infection that they are known to carry and it can affect unborn children which is why pregnant women should not be handling litter boxes, you can also affect adults or anyone who has an immune compromise.\n\nForniers gangrene and necrotizing fasciitis are also two bacteria that love to take up residence in dark, damp spaces. Necrotizing fasciitis can be caused by multiple different bacteria, but one of the major causes is strep A.\n\nWhile both are more common in people that are overall in poor health and/or hygiene, \n\nAnd the American journal of pediatrics says up to 50% of cat bites and scratches can become infected whereas only 10 to 15% of dog bites become infected.",

        "selftext": "TIFU By letting the cat get my wife pregnant\n\nTechnically this happened about three weeks ago since the test just came back positive...\n\nSome background: \n\nLast year my wife and I had our first child. It was a less than ideal pregnancy that had her dealing with weeks of bed rest dude to preeclampsia with severe features. It wrecked total havoc on not only her physical health but her mental heath as well. fortunately everything was all right in the end and she gave birth to our healthy 4lb 2oz boy just shy of two months early (who\u2019s doing fantastic now). \n\nDue to the difficulty of this first pregnancy and concerns over COVID, we decided it was best to put off kid number two for at least a couple of years. She started birth control shortly after giving birth to be sure we had no surprises, but the pill tends to make her very sick and she wanted to lose weight, so she stopped taking it. We thought rubbers would be enough, but that\u2019s where our cat comes in... \n\nOur cat is an evil genius. I seriously think the greasy orange little shit is still smarter than our nearly one year old. He gets into everything, and I do mean everything. No door, drawer, or cabinet can stop him, and if he knows where something he wants is he WILL find it. It\u2019s so bad that for weeks after adopting him I thought there was poltergeist in the house because each morning I\u2019d wake up to find every single cabinet door in the kitchen wide open!\n\nSo how did I fuck up and let him impregnate my wife? \n\nWell, my first fuck up was storing the condoms in the same drawer as the Q-tips, which he loves to get into and shred apart. He must have seen the box of Q-tips in the drawer when I put my rubbers away, because not even an hour later I stumbled upon a horrific scene of chewed plastic straws, shredded cotton fluff and shiny gold condom wrappers scattered around the gapping drawer that once contained them... I didn\u2019t think anything of it at the time and just cleaned up the destroyed Q-tips and put the condoms that had spilled everywhere back into their box without a concern in the world. \n\nWe ended up having some sexy time later that night, and I vividly remember stumbling into the dark bathroom, opening said drawer, and blindly fumbling around in the box to pull out a condom (as was the routine) thinking nothing of what happened earlier. \n\nThat is until fast forward a few weeks to just the other day, when my wife was complaining of nausea and tender breast. We immediately shoot each a concerned glance as this ain\u2019t our first rodeo, and she felt the same way before discovering her first pregnancy. She still had a half empty box of tests from the year before and decided to take one just to be sure. Followed by another one... and another one... all positive. \n\nWe start wracking our brains wondering what happened when suddenly it hits me... that damned cat. I ran over to bathroom drawer where I kept the condoms, dumped out the box on the counter and started to inspect each miserable little foil square. Sure enough, several had noticeable scratches, teeth marks, and even full blown punctures in them... which leads me to fuck up number two, not checking to see if the cat chewed on any of my rubbers weeks before when he had gotten into that drawer...\n\nCan't wait to explain to my new son or daughter one day that they owe their existence\nto the family cat!\n\nTL:DR\n\nI didn\u2019t check to see if my cat had chewed on any of my condoms when he got into the drawer I kept them in. Three weeks later and despite our plans to the contrary my wife is pregnant, presumably thanks to my asshole cat who gets into everything.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI\u2019ve been informed of something called the cat tax. Below you\u2019ll find a picture of the offending cat in all his greasy, orange glory. I think the picture sums up his personality well. \n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/eFHNFqo",

Also, obligatory not today but two years ago.\n\nLet's flashback to two years ago, I picked up my VERY drunk (now ex) boyfriend from the pub. We were pretty early on in the relo so I thought this would be a great opportunity to get the boyf to open up and spill his secrets.\n\nI asked him, 'Hey, tell me a secret.' and what he said next will forever haunt me to my core. He turned to me, looked me dead in the eye, and said 'I like to stick things up my ass. I like to stick *carrots* up my ass.'\n\nNow don't get me wrong, I am a big fan of carrots as a vegetable. Before 'the incident' I would eat them everyday as a quick snack, and use them for all my cooking. I would say I would rate them as God Tier.\n\nAnd I'm definitely not one to kink shame, if anything - I froth a good kink, but something about the carrots made me sad. Possibly, the fact that I put carrots high up on the vegetable hierarchy and this seemed like blasphemy. The carrot gods are crying. I also suggested getting a legitimate sex toy for him, but each time I asked I was shut down with scoff.\n\nDespite the carrot-shame it brought me, I decided to support him on his carrot endeavor.\n\nHe was beyond happy with the carrot-support, and told me he's waited years to finally tell someone. So flash forward through the next 12 months of my life which consisted of only getting him off by sticking a carrot up his crack, him spending copious amounts from our joint account on bags of carrots, and me coming home from a long days at work to see two soggy carrots in the shower with a sad bottle of lube.\n\nIt's been a year since carrot-gate, and I still can't look at one without shedding a tear. Ultimately, I think it was the carrots that ended the relationship. I was never orange enough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: I asked my boyfriend to tell my a secret and he confessed he loves sticking carrots up his clacker. That year of my life is now only referred to as 'carrot-gate.'\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: spelling & holy moly thank you for the awards and the comments - I got a good giggle out of them.  And trust me, I know the joint account was ridiculous - we were young and thought getting a joint account would mean we would be together forever LOL. Little did I know...",

        "selftext": "So here it goes.\n\nMe, F 19 UK. Started growing wisdom teeth and since I couldn't handle the pain anymore I asked the nhs to give me an appointment with a dentist since all in my area are booked.\n\nAnd the appointment I got was 20 miles away from where I lived. In a different town.\n\nSo, genius me comes up with the idea to walk the 20 miles since Google said its only 6 hours and 20 minutes. First bad idea. Should've just taken the train.\n\nSo the day of the appointment (a couple of weeks ago), I wake up at 1am and prepare some food and drink for the walk. I head out at 2am and my appointment is at 10:10.\n\nI told myself that 8 hours is more than enough (since I'm reletively fit. So it's pitch black and I head outside without my glasses. Second bad idea since I can't see anything without them, but I'm too lazy to go up and get em.\n\nAs I start its reletively OK, I'm walking through my town. It's quiet and dark. As I head outside the city area, it's just fields upon fields of crops. Beautiful night lights of the city and I took some pictures. Now as I walk further out, . On the third mistake, google in all its wisdom, tells me to walk alongside the highway....\n\nSo I'm walking  5/6 miles in 4/5am and the road is empty and I'm listening to contrapoints videos that I downloaded earlier. Good Times. \n\nAnd as I approach my 10th mile 6am, I can feel the pain in my foot getting worse and walking on the grass on the side of the road is very much harder than walking on the road. And since cars started using the road I had to move to the grass. OOF!\n\nSo now I have a very sore foot and all the water I drank earlier is starting to signal its release.....try and hold it in but I  fixed the problem later in my own way that I'm not gonna say on reddit. \n\nNow on the 13th mile around 7am ish. Pain is spreading to the hips and I need some more snacks. And thankfully there's a beautiful village ahead and a corner shop/grocery shop that I spot from afar. I take some pics of the village and I go into the shop and I buy chocolates (good) and soda (4th mistake). So on my next break (I had been taking regular 5min breaks) I decided to have some soda, on an empty stomach ........oh, the pain in my tummy!!!! Despite that, I get up and walk since in this remote part of the country,  I can't just call an uber and give up....I can only do that in the final town.\n\nAround 15/16th mile and 8am ish, shit gets real! My whole body is aching and I'm starting to approach the outskirts of the other town and finally there are some proper side walks to walk on. But guess what, google fucks me again (5th fuck up) and this town has some of the longest and steepest hills ever. Like 2 miles long and all incline. My foot is giving up and I'm just pushing myself to get in town so I can call an uber. \n\n\nSo, it's  the last two miles and its already 9:30 am. So I know I'm not gonna get my appointment. Sidenote: my phone is at 15%, down all the way from 100 at start.  I'm just inching ahead at this point, and this is the 2mile incline hill. Life just fucks me harder and I need to pee again! (I blame the soda!)\nSo now I'm getting into the main town and walking like a zombie....\n\nSo now I make a smart move and decide to go to the big morrisons (similar to walmart) at the end of this long and shitty Road. I only have to go straight, so no need for shitty google and I turn my phone off as well. (Another smart move)\n\n\nNow (around 10am) as I inch closer to my prize, (the toilet) I can stand anymore cause of the pain. But thank god I find some benches along the road to rest and massage my legs. \n\nFinally around 11am after 20 miles of walking, I see the morrisons logo!\n\n YES!\n\n The final few steps through the parking lot were the hardest! And I storm in and find the closest bathroom nearby. Sweet relief!\n\nAfter that, I finally noticed that I'm getting very hungry! So I buy all the cake I want. (And a spoon). I start to devour the cake as I realise, One: this cake tastes amaizing! And 2: I didn't call an uber yet! (Very close major fuck up)\n\nSo I open my phone and 5%left......I quickly enter my home address into the app and get confirmation that the driver arrives in 8 min. But phone turns off as I almost read the name of the car and driver. I only managed to see the grey colour of the car....and now begins the most stressful 8 mins of my life as I wait in front of morrisons for a grey car with an uber logo......my phone is dead and if I miss this uber I'm very fucked! In a new town, can't walk at all and with no access to my phone for help, I'm done for!\n\n\nFinally the car arrives! (it stopped in front of me) and I get in and relax. And on the way back, we travel the same route that I took and I get a second reminder of every single one of my fuckups. But hey, I atleast can brag that I once walked 20 miles at once!\n\nWhen I got home, I took off everything and showered first. And enjoyed the rest of the cake ( this is a cake for 16 people!) and went to sleep. I couldn't walk properly for a few days and I had a mild fever. And the pain in the joints and muscles lasted for about a week. And the tooth pain went away anyways.....\n\n\nThanks for reading this despite my horrible storytelling.\n\n\n\n\nTLDR: I overestimated my walking capability, got cocky (pun intended) and tried to walk 20 miles in 6 hours.....got fucked by google maps directions.... ended up spending ~9 hours and almost got stuck in a different town with no phone and no ability to move.\n\nWalking 20 miles at once is a 0/10, wouldn't recommend.\n\n\n\nEdit: this is what rip inbox feels like....I'm sorry but I don't think I can answer everyone's comments...\n\nEdit 2: for the people asking why I didn't take my glasses, I should've clarified that I can still function fine without them. But its just nice to have them. And also I didn't want to wake up my roommate by constantly going in and out.\n\nEdit 3: American English helps everyone understand what I'm talking about. And also I lived in America for a while so some of the words are still stuck in my head. And for anyone with  doubt of my britishness u can go sod off.",

I've had plenty of girlfriends before and they're happy, I'm happy and there's no need to change that. Anyway.\n\nI headed out to Toronto last Friday morning for a few meetings. Every now and then, I'll have meetings Friday and Monday, so I'll stay the weekend and have a little bit of a holiday in a nice hotel somewhere.\n\nAt about 4pm on Friday, I had finished my work, checked into my hotel and was feeling a bit horny. Anyone in the bi community will know it's easier to pickup guys then girls, so I downloaded Grindr, created an account, uploaded a few pictures (without my face - half because I'm ugly and half because I don't want to be recognized) and did some browsing. Some 20ish minutes in - I got a message. This guy was about my age, didn't have a picture, but gave me a description of himself and he sounded like a good way to spend my Friday night.\n\nWe start to make a plan for 7pm and he mentions he's married and asks if I'd be interested in his husband coming along and having a little threesome action. Now a threesome wasn't on my to-do list, but I'll give anything a go once so I said what the hell.\n\nAnyways, it comes around to 6:30pm and I get a call. I have two SIM cards in my phone (one from Canada and one from the USA). It's my cousin who lives in Canada. I only speak to this guy probably 2-3 times a year, so it's a little weird, but not any cause for concern or anything and I was a bit busy at the time with some prep, so I let it go to VM. 60 seconds later, a txt. From my cousin:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*\"Hi it's xxxxx from Grindr. We're 2 minutes away, OK if we're a bit early?\"*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt took me about 30 seconds, but it clicks. Canada. Gay Married Cousin. The Description Matches. Holy fucking shit, I just organised a threesome with my cousin.\n\nI sat there in the bathroom, trying not to have a panic attack for a few minutes until my phone rings again. Now obviously I'm not going to answer it, and I'm just praising god that I gave him my Canadian number over Grindr that he didn't have, and that I had him saved in my phone. The room phone begins to ring as well. Holy shit.\n\nI swear to god, I have never put on clothes so fast and bolted down 30 floors of stairs so fast. At the bottom of the staircase, I was straight through that fire door and hid in the nearest McDonalds for the next 4 hours. 14 missed calls (10 from my cousin, 4 from hotel reception) and I took the SIM card out of my phone and snapped it in half. Found a new hotel room that night just in case. Have to come up with an excuse for work and my clients as to why I need a new Canadian number, but I think it was better than the other option...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR Went to Canada for work, wanted a quick hookup, didn't do my due diligence and almost ended up having a threesome with my gay cousin and his husband, ran away and hid in a McDonalds for 4 hours**",

I don't think it's fair to pressure people to go one way or the other. If you are happy, then that's all that matters. That being said, it really helps to have a safe place to talk about yourself. I am seeing a counselor right now, not because I think anything is terribly wrong with me, but because I believe that it's healthy to have a place where you can work with a professional and just be open. It has really helped me be more mindful of my actions and how I think about myself.",

Read: not awkward at all, bc the gay community is so small and so slutty, this isn\u2019t even that surprising. I\u2019ve heard of waaaaay worse (like guys running into their dads or sons on Grindr). And hell, you guys might have even become closer because of it.

My parents didn't raise me spiritual or anything but I knew they did have a little shrine they liked to keep some things and whatever it was just part of the house I had friends ask me about and it was nothing crazy. They are also really fond of leathers and animal skins which... Cringe but anyway. When I got old enough I asked my parents what tribe we were and I was told the Yuan-Ti. Now I didnt know anything of it but I did tell my friends in elementary school and whatever and bragged I was close to nature (as you do). So recently I applied to colleges and since you only have to be 1/16 native I thought I had this in the bag. Confirmed with my parents and sent in my applications as 1/8th Yuan-ti tribe.  I found out all these years that is a fictional race of snake people from Dungeons and Dragons. TLDR: since I was a kid my parents told me I was native Yuan-ti but actually they were just nerds and I told everyone I know that I was a fictional snake person.",

A woman and her twin brother could both marry non natives and have children with them, but only the woman\u2019s kids would receive tribal benefits.\n\nOther Native Americans might use blood quantum as the determining factor.\n\nThe whole 1/16th thing isn\u2019t an accurate measure either, as some go by more or less. They are all different. \n\nThe bottom line is, even if you have a Native ancestor, you are not native. You do not identify with them or represent them culturally. You show a huge lack of knowledge about this subject in general. Being native isn\u2019t just some sort of fun fact you get to throw out to make yourself seem more interesting.\n\nI say this as someone who has Native blood on both sides. My dad\u2019s mother was native and has many surviving relatives still on reservations, but I did not qualify for membership, nor do I identify as Native because it would honestly be doing their people a disservice since I have not experienced the same hardships as them nor am I culturally a part of their community. I am not representative of them.",

And what a better way to celebrate, than with a good old fashioned booty call. \n\nI had recently reconnected with a man I had previously had some playtime with. The last time we were together, I had what was probably the best sex of my life. So to say I was excited to be talking with him again was an understatement. \n\nAfter some basic chat, we made plans to meet up tonight. This next tidbit may seem like TMI, but it\u2019s important to the story. My IUD does not play nice and more often than not I\u2019m bleeding to some extent. Tonight included. But he was fine with that, so we kept our plans. \n\nHe comes over, and things instantly get heated. More MIND BLOWING sex commences. Hot, steamy, sheet soaking sex. We take some time to recharge and go for round 2. Not as hot and steamy, but still damn good. I lay down next to him, but under the covers. He gets up and starts getting dressed. We have some small talk, and then he walks over to my side of the bed and looks at the floor. \n\n\u201cWhat is THAT?\u201d He says. \n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I look over the edge of the bed. There are two dark spots on the floor. \u201cEh. I\u2019ll clean it up\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know what this is, right?\u201d He asks. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s...\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not blood\u201d he interrupts. \u201cThat\u2019s not red.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat??\u201d\n\nAgain, he says \u201cThat\u2019s not blood. That\u2019s BROWN. You know what that is.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d I stammer. \u201cThat can\u2019t be. I would have known if that happened.\u201d \n\n\nHe just starts laughing, DOUBLE CHECKS HIS SOCKS, and heads down my stairs, and out the door. \n\nY\u2019all. I came so hard, I pooped. Somehow, during  round 1, my body was contracting so intensely, I actually dropped two small turds. And since my ass was off the edge of the bed, they landed on my bedroom floor without either of us noticing. In my defense, I had just finished a round of augmentin a few days prior, and my stomach is still readjusting. \n\nPretty sure he\u2019s already deleted my contact info. He\u2019s given me the best sex of my life, and it\u2019s most likely never happening again.\n\nTL;DR: I pooped during some of the best sex of my life. He took off as soon as we realized what happened. Bye amazing sex.",

She was riding me, came hard af, finished her orgasm, then stopped **DEAD** in her grind and looked me straight in the eyes with a very serious expression: \"We might want to continue this in the shower\". I am not sure why I immediately knew what she was eluding to, but she had no fucking shame so I wasn't going to be a lil' bitch about it. Obviously my only option was to match her level of chill, get up, grab her hand, and make a mad dash to the shower being sure not to turn on any main lights on the way (or it becomes real you know?). We got in the shower and soaped each other up quick enough to not see (or smell) anything. And finished our task at hand. Looking back, I know that the alcohol was half of how we didn't let it ruin the sex, and ignoring what was on the bed until later was the other half. We slept on a futon across the room from the scene of the crime, and once she was asleep I rolled all the bed linens up into themselves like a fucking spring roll and slid the whole thing into the front load wash like a Chernobyl survivor. I didn't bring it up until years later (when it was funny). Apparently she was getting over a stomach bug at the time and still wasn't back 100%. She was so embarrassed and shocked at how I \"let her get away with that shit\", that she knew she would marry me from that moment forward.\n\nEdit: spelling",

If I were him, this would just be a super funny story to tell of what happened after some amazing sex with no drawbacks. I'm definitely not a fan of shit.

            "I\u2019m an adult. I pay my taxes, I go to the grocery store, and all of the rest of the things like an adult. No one considers me to be immature (that I know of) at this point in my life.  HOWEVER the humor a fart can bring is still amazing to me. I for whatever reason fart A LOT. I am pretty physically fit and eat a lot of protein so that\u2019s likely why. The weird thing though is my farts generally on a scale of 1-10 are generally a 2 in the smelly category and a 9 in the loud and long category. My girl always goes oh my you\u2019re so disgusting when you fart like that. Not actually upset generally laughs and also exclaims she can\u2019t believe how much I fart. \n\nNow the funny part and if she ever finds out I told anyone she\u2019ll probably kill me. I can probably count on one hand how often she farts around me over the course of a given year. It\u2019s been 12 years so she doesn\u2019t really hide much from me. On one of those farts that comes every 3-6 farts those things come out sounding like a 2. HOWEVER the stench on a scale of 1-10 is about a 13. Like I\u2019m talking laying in bed watching a movie and she\u2019s asleep and lets a little one slip, results in me waking her up from gagging while the dog is at the bedroom door whining as it scratches the door trying to escape. BAD.\n\nWhen we are in the truck making the 4 hour drive to the river and I fart she\u2019s like whatever and doesn\u2019t even roll the window down. My friends are at this point the same way. If she farted I\u2019d have to pull over and be like FUCK trucks ruined I\u2019ll never get that smell out and I\u2019d be walking the rest of the way to the river house. \n\nThe best/worst part about all of this.

            "Awe! The sweet romance of pregnant life! This reminds me of when I was pushing 40 weeks but wanted to provide some sweet loving for the SO so I put on my game face and started seducing him as best as my belly would allow. I was straddled on top of him and suddenly overwhelmed w the urge to vomit. I sat bolt upright and must have had the feeling  all over my face because SO side-eyes me and lovingly says that in spite of his raging desire for my voluptuous body, his urges can wait if I am not feeling well, I take  a breath and press on. Quickly another wave of nausea sweeps over me and, again, I sit upright in a desperate burst of energy and clamp my hand over my mouth. Realizing it wasn\u2019t something I\u2019d be able to overpower, I frantically shuffled down my SO\u2019s body, dry heaving the whole way and with one hand clamped over my mouth. I raced for the bathroom and just as I managed to walk through the door, all exits opened up. I spewed vomit to the wall, down the tank and even a little in the toilet. All of this internal pressure was too much for my bladder so I also violently pissed myself. Pee streaming angrily down my leg and vomit plastering all surfaces within range, I hovered over the toilet just trying to stay upright. This ended up being the first of 4 days of some sort of horrible stomach bug I was sure would kill me but myself and my precious cargo survived. I still crack up thinking about how close I can to vomiting all over my baby daddy and possibly ruining sex for a very long time.",

The evening came, my brother came home from work and went to talk with my other brother in his room. \n\nMy mom called to ask what ingredients we had around the house so she can pick up stuff for dinner. An hour later she called to let me know she'll be home soon and my brothers and I have to dispute who has to help her bring groceries in. \n\nI went to my brothers, \"Hey, you two have to pick which one of you have to help mom bring groceries in. She'll be home in 5 minutes.\" I walked away like I was so clever, not including myself as an option. \n\n\"Why doesn't she help?\" I hear one say to the other. \"I dunno,\" the other says. \n\nA few minutes pass and the two of them came out of the room and approached me on the couch. \n\"You grab the arms, I'll grab the legs?\" \n\"Yup.\"\n\nMy older brother grabbed my ankles and the other my arms. I made it a little difficult though, I stiffened (which is probably easier) and I crossed my arms holding my elbows close to my torso so he didnt have anywhere to hold except a poor grip on my shoulders. \n\nBeing the weak noodle I am, I couldn't hold my arms in long enough. He grabbed my upper arms and they carried me toward the stairs to the front door. I half expected they wouldn't bring me outside, but I knew they would go all the way even when I had no jacket or shoes.\n\nI didnt want to be carried awkwardly down the stairs so as we got closer, I struggled. I kicked my legs with little effort because I didnt want to hurt anyone, and since that didnt really work I had an idea. Risky. I lifted my arms straight up so my brothers hands would lose grip an drop me. \n\nI dropped slowly since he was still trying to hold me with my arms up (I was wearing a long sleeve bunched at my elbows) but as I hit the floor I realized my shirt had lifted. My sleeves must have been pulled off my arms, lifting the rest.\n\nIt was over. My ankles were released. \n\nI put my now freed hands down over my chest and feel my nipple. Yup. The brother by my feet definitely saw. I noticed he was looking away at the moment, but I was sure he saw when it happened. \n\nThankfully I am small chested, so I'm not as embarrassed as someone else would be. \nBut it is still awkward to think about.\n\nP.S. Sorry bro....\n\nTLDR: decided not to wear a bra today. my brother saw my nipple. \n\n\nEdit: I was home for the holidays from college, moving into a new place with my fiance this May. My brothers help support our single mom.

            "Okay, since this is an awesome story I think people will get a chuckle out of this one. I had a similar situation except I was in the brothers' position and it was with a guy being carried. It happened at scouting activity a couple months back, when the leaders tried to teach us how to make a stretcher to carry injured people. I should point out scouting groups where I live are not gendered, so our group is comprised of both males and females, ranging from 7 to 20 years old. One of us \"big guys\" (18) was to act out as the injured person, with a broken leg. I was to be the first responder, doing the whole \"call an ambulance! Prepare the stretcher!\" thing and such, and the people around 15-17yo were to make the actual stretcher. Everything was going well, I splinted his leg, while the others made the stretcher with walking staffs (staves?), rope and shirts. Then it was time to put him onto the stretcher and move him out. First problem: the stretcher got undone as we rolled him onto it. It had to be made again because one of the shirts was put on backwards. No biggie. Then a bigger problem arose.\n I saw mr. Brokenleg McGee in an awkward position, hands over crotch and sweating like a cold bottle on a hot day. I instantly noticed the arising problem, and also that the only girl our age (19) was the one leading the whole stretcher making deal, and the \"rolling Brokenleg onto the stretcher\" part too. As is normal, the person leading will be closer to the center. So in this case she was right over his stomach/chest, with her chest rather close to his face, as she helped with rolling him onto the stretcher. It turns out, as I later learned, he has a huge crush on her (And she is not comfortable with it), so that did not help at all. Luckily nobody mentioned anything, and I and another guy awkwardly carried our doubly troubled friend on the stretcher to finish the task. I do wonder though, if anyone involved even remembers what happened, and if anyone else noticed it. It was very awkward from my perspective but I tried to be a good sport and keep it going as if nothing happened.\n\nTL;DR: a guy about to be carried on a stretcher for a broken leg drill had to cover his boner while his crush leaned over him to help roll him onto the stretcher itself.",

            "Hilarious story, but to comment towards the people assuming she or her brothers are fuck ups for living at home, a large number of people in their 20s now live at home until their late 20s-early 30s. The ones who don't often wish they could have. It makes sense to live at home and save money if possible. I *am* a half fuck-up, live at home and graduate this semester. But my younger sisters live at home too and I plan to stay at home for a couple years as well. Why? Because all three of us are in so much student debt it is absolutely insane. I can have it paid off in my early 30s if I live at home for a couple years or I can have it paid off when I'm 52. Easiest choice of my life. If you have accommodating, cool parents, absolutely live at home. It will be awkward and you can't really bring anyone home, but if those are your life priorities you probably won't be successful anyway, honestly. \n\nLiving at home =/= unsuccessful. ",

So most of my stuff is still in boxes as there is not enough space and I planned on moving once I was stable to our own place. I'm looking for something in these boxes, but it's summer and hot and muggy in the basement. I take off the concealing sweater I was wearing and continue to move around and dig in 10-15 odd boxes. I then, because I hate bras, get annoyed and toss that on the sweater and keep digging. \n\nI hear the doorbell, I am too stupid to put two and two together, I was expecting a visitor. I also blanked on the fact the tiny tank top I'm wearing? The entire front panel, the part that covers your breasts? Entirely made of lace... Lace easily seen through as the point of the top is to entice but still \"cover\" (abercrombie in the early 2000's). So still digging away, doorbell goes off, hear my dad stomp downstairs to where I'm digging. He walks in. I straightened right up, facing him full on with nothing blocking the view from waist up except for a few gold strands of thread... \n\n\"You have a visitor. Put a damn bra on.\" \n\nI totally spaced I had removed the concealing layers and was basically standing naked to the waist in front of my father. He didn't seem to pleased about it either and left quickly. I RAN to my sweater and put it on inside out. Did not care... Still cringe to this day. ",

You're in for a ride.\n\nI posted this in a comment thread of r/ask and people on there requested I put it on \"somewhere this story will get the recognition it deserves\" and I was directed to here.\n\n\nOk a little back story I got a rescue puppy back in January and she was terrified of everything and everyone. There was a pet store down the street I used to carry her to to try and expose her to the outside world and other people. \n\nThe girl who worked at the pet store instantly bonded with my puppy, wow. My dog wouldn't let anyone else go near her without her crying or peeing or being terrified. So naturally we became regulars, and the more and more I interacted with this girl and the more I saw her interactions with my dog an other people in the store she seems super sweet and just an all around good person. I asked her for her number, even though I felt uncomfortable doing that to a woman in her place of work but she seemed receptive, so that's good. It's also surprisingly hard to meet some one in my city. \n\nWe exchange a few messages and go out for a walk with my dog together. Everything seems great. She's educated. Cute. Loves animals. Everything seems great. \n\nWe end up back at my place for a few drinks (4or 5 max) this is kind of an important detail, and we stopped drinking around 10pm. And she ends up staying over. Now here's where it all goes downhill.\n\nI awoke up in the middle of the night and she was yelling at herself about how her dad is an asshole, and some other crazy talk, very scattered subjects, hence why I can't be more specific but that one stuck out to me. Very strange behaviour for 2 am. \n\nI tried to calm her down or try and figure out what the fuck was going on. She didn't even seem to notice she was doing it, \"oh I'm sorry did I wake you?\" We had a really nice evening, But this girl just turned crazy. There was clearly something wrong  she wasn't shouting at me. She wasn't even shouting at her self just in to nothing, in to a void. \n\nI repeatedly tried to stop her, but she couldn't see the issue  as if she wasn't even aware she was doing it. Eventually I just gave up and went to sleep on the sofa because I just couldn't deal with it.\n\nShe came in and cried.and said she didn't mean to upset me and can we just go back to sleep together. \n\nSure. That's all I wanted anyway. Can we please just sleep and can you please just stop shouting/ yelling / talking?\n\nWhen we got to the bedroom she turned around and she had the craziest eyes I've ever seen (and I've dated red heads). And says \"don't you ever fucking talk to me like that ever again or I swear to god....\" Now at this point I've seen behavior like this before and it's very concerning.\n\n-Nope. Get out. I cut her short on whatever threats she was going to make. Get the fuck out. \n\nCue crying again \"but I'm a girl you can't do this to me\"\n\nYeah I don't care I'm not doing. This it's two am and I'm not having you talk to me like this.\n\nAt this point there was a lot of back and forth from crying of \"but how am I meant to get home\" jumping to \"well fuck you I'm leaving\".\nSo she gathers her things and claims to not know how to get out the building. It's a condo building. You walk down the hall to an elevator. If there isn't an elevator. You went the wrong way so go the other way down the hall. Bearing in mind she lives in a condo building 3 blocks away. It's not like she doesn't know how a condo works or what area she in in.\n\nSo I offer to walk her to the door, or at least the elevator, I want her out. But I'm not just going to throw her literally out the door with out her things. I just want her out, there's clearly something not right and I don't want to deal with whatever it is or whatever will come of more of this behaviour. So I help her gather her things and open the door for her and start showing her where the elevator is.\n\nWalking down the hall she collapsed! Like dead weight. And no she wasn't faking it. She was out cold, out of the blue. Just folded up right there in the hall.\n\n\nNow here's where I fucked up. \n\n\nMy thought process was 'hell nah, you're still leaving'.  So I drag her unconscious body down the hall and bundle her in the elevator. (Yup. Very aware this was a mistake in hindsight) \n\nBearing in mind I was not expecting to be leaving, so you can imagine the look on the concierge's face when I rock up out of the elevator in my boxers shorts saying 'aw man i fucked up you gotta help me here'.\n\nHe's dialling 911 and sure enough, the elevator disappeared, up to the 4th floor. \nWe called it back but obviously someone had tried to use the elevator and the door would have opened up to that train wreck. I'm sure the look on their face would have been priceless, anyway it came back and she was still unconscious.\nWe're talking to the 911 operator answering the base questions, address. What happened etc, and just like a horror movie we turn around and she's awake! Stood there. Crazy eyes and all.\n\nShe was awake long enough to yell at the concierge before she passed out again. This time hitting her head on the marble floor of the lobby. \n\nI'll never forget the sound of her head hitting the floor. Or the concierge's \"ooooo\" wince at the sound of it. \n\nSo here's how the 911 call went. He's on speaker phone with me and the concierge there.\n\n911: ok. So I need you to say 'now' every time she takes a breath. And I don't want you to stop until I say so, do you understand?\nMe: yep. Got it\n911: ok start now \n......\n911: ok I don't think you understand my instructions,\nMe: no dude. I understood. \n911: ok so start now and don't stop until I say so. Go.\nMe: ok \n........ \n911 again ...\nMe : dude. I understand. If she takes a breath I'll say now. \n\nSo now of course she's not breathing.\n\n911: ok you need to start cpr and the concierge needs to go get a defibrillator.\n\nSo here I am in my boxers doing CPR in the lobby of my building.\n\nA fire truck pulls up after only 2 minutes they have a defibrillator concierge still hasn't come back yet. So they take over and an ambulance follows shortly where they bundle her in to the back and drive off.\n\nHoly shit what just happened.\n\nAnd of course now the cops turn up... \n\nDid I mention there's cameras in the elevator and just the part of the hallway that shows me dragging an unconscious girl, whom is now not breathing..... Yeahh try explaining that one.\n\nSo the cops want to know. Why are you kicking a girl out at 2 am. And why is she not breathing. And what's this on video ....\n\nI told them everything but of course they didn't believe me, so now I'm terrified. What if she's dead. Nothing about this looks good for me. What if she's alive but, clearly she has psychological issues and decides to remember things a different way. Or in her mind I attacked her. Or if the cops turn up and say what did he do? And then that triggers her to say I did something. \n\nFast forward 3 days and every time the phone rings I'm expecting it to be the cops, I have no idea if this girl is alive or dead. Or if she woke up in hospital and the cops questioning her, what did he do to you? Etc etc. Every day I have this hanging over me. I don't know what to do. I did text to see if she was alive. No reply.\n\nI'm headed to the LCBO for a bottle of wine. And bang. She's right there infront of me! \n\n\"Hi ! How's it going so great to see you!\"\nErm. Hi. I thought you were dead!!\n\"Oh I was. But just for a few minutes haha\"\n\nYeah. I know. I was the one doing CPR!\n\n\"Oh. I'm sorry. That explains why my chest hurts I guess. Haha. Oh well. So you wanna hang out? We could go back to your place for some drinks again.\"\n\nshe has No recollection! Wants to come hang out.... No absolutely not. She had no idea about any of it. \n\nNeedless to say I said no. Glad you're alive. Good luck. Goodbye. \nShe left me a 2 minute long voice mail a few days later crying and trying to apologize, I don't need that in my dogs life Im afraid. \n\nI have many questions. As do many of my friends as well as people on a comment thread I put this on before. And unfortunately I don't think I will have any of the answers. And I'm not going to contact this person again to try and find answers. I'm aware dragging her down the hall and throwing her in the elevator wasn't the kosher thing to do.\n\nTldr: had a girl over for a date. She went crazy I had to do cpr and explain to the cops why there's video of me dragging her unconscious body down the hall and dumping it in the elevator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit:.

Like, if she forgot this accident, but is aware of the fact that sometimes something gets loose in her head.   \n\n\nShe clearly remembers being dead, and seemingly doesnt see a problem with that, so there must be a reason for that.

Alcohol hits them very, very hard and will cause them to spike because it's very high sugar.\n\nNo alcohol involved here, and it's a crash not a spike, but it highlights how much a spike or crash can affect a person with diabetes.\n\nI had a friend with type 1, and if her sugar got too low, she'd get pretty delirious and have no memory later on.\n\nWe went to see toy story 3, and her sugar crashed during the film. Unfortunately I had never seen her crash before so I didn't fully understand how to read her, and it was dark in the theatre. She also had left her meter in the car for some reason. She just held my hand really really tight which was unusual. I asked her at the end of the movie how she was, and I could tell by her answer that she wasn't fully there.\n\nFortunately she had sugar tablets with her and could walk out of the theater, but only with some heavy assistance from me. We did our best to make it look like we were just walking as a couple arm-in-arm. I almost had to carry her from the car to her apartment. She was pretty incoherent. Awake but not making much sense. I put her on the couch, went and got her some orange juice and kept her talking until she started coming too a bit. Eventually I carried her to bed, tucked her in, got her another glass of orange juice, and went and chilled on the couch until morning.\n\nThe next morning she was very grateful but couldn't remember anything from about the middle point of the movie till she woke up in her bed.",

This just reminded me of a vet tech girl I briefly dated (hooked up with a few times) years and years back. \n\nShe warned me she was narcoleptic / sometimes seizure prone\u2026and that one of her triggers was when she orgasmed. Young dumb and horny me thought \u201chey no problem, at least I\u2019ll know she\u2019s not faking it!\u201d  \n\nSo the first time we\u2019re getting down with it she warns me again and says just make sure if I choke or something role me on my side it usually doesn\u2019t last more than a few seconds and it\u2019ll be fine. *Don\u2019t worry.*\n\nWe start going at it and I go down on her while she\u2019s laying on her back and orgasm #1 happens like 1 minute in. She just kinda goes limp on the bed after shaking for a couple seconds. I actually didn\u2019t notice at first till she came to again and pulled me up and I was like ok no biggie. That wasn\u2019t so bad. \n\nThe fuckup was then she wanted to ride on top. Ok, cool, I like that. Except she came again\u2026and promptly collapsed on me. No bracing, nothing, one minute she\u2019s riding me and the next I get headbutted in the face trying to catch her. Now she\u2019s just splayed out on top of me, I\u2019m still in her, and she\u2019s not moving. Eyes are rolled back and partially closed, she\u2019s breathing but passed out cold. This one must have been a good one because she didn\u2019t come to for several minutes (I lost it and gently rolled her off me and on her side just in case then just kinda sat there awkwardly waiting for her to wake up).  She eventually did like nothing happened and we restarted but yeah the constant stop/wait/start killed it for me and after a couple hookups I was like sorry this just isn\u2019t working out for me.",

            "The mother of my daughter had a pretty traumatic childhood. Her father molested her, her younger brother and sister for roughly six years. When we were dating dude tried to reach out from prison. She tried to write him and try to get some type of closure I guess? She starts having a rough time and breaks contact. She starts to feel better A week or so later and I\u2019m thinking nothing of it. \n\nI\u2019m woken up one night by her shaking me. She\u2019s clinging to my arm and whispering \u201cdon\u2019t move or he\u2019ll get us.\u201d I freeze for a second thinking someone broke into the house. She starts wimpering saying \u201cI don\u2019t want him to find us, please don\u2019t let him find us.\u201d At this point we\u2019re in a 1 bed room apartment if there\u2019s an intruder he\u2019s gonna find us. I say \u201clet me go check.\u201d She digs her claws in and fucking locks onto me. \u201cShe says \u201cNo! Don\u2019t get out of the covers, he\u2019s under the bed.\u201d At this point I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s not a burglar under the bed. So I start asking questions. I spent 30 minutes talking to this woman about what was going on, while she spoke in an almost childish less mature way she was wide ass awake talking to me. She was terrified that her abusive father was under our bed and was going to hurt her. I finally got her to let me up and the look of terror on her face is something I\u2019ll never forget when I turned the light on. \n\nI spent so long trying to prove to her we were safe and that she just needed to lay down and get some rest. As she started to listen to me she asked that I leave the light on, I agree and get in bed. We\u2019re lying face to face and I\u2019m running my fingers through her hair trying to comfort her and she sort of blinks but for an extended period of time. When she opens her eyes she goes \u201cOh hey babe, why\u2019s the light on.?\u201d I was dumbfounded. I explained what had been going on and she had ZERO recollection of it. We\u2019ve since separated but are on good terms, and she still has no recollection of what happened. She didn\u2019t have a bad dream or night terror. She isn\u2019t a sleep walker. She straight was losing her mind about her dad hiding under our bed and then snapped out of it. \n\nNot saying this girl is worth your time, but there could be other things going on. Some people said it could be some type of diabetic episode or mental health medication not mixing with alcohol. It could be some suppressed trauma that the alcohol brought up and what you saw has nothing to do with the girls conscious state.

OP maybe you should ask her if she has a seizure disorder. Alcohol is a known trigger of seizures and temporal lobe epislepsy is well known to cause neuropsychiatric symptoms. Woulda explain her lack of recollection and the intermittent periods of lucidity. Wouldn't really explain her \"cardiac arrest\" though unless she was having non-convulsive seizures.

She went from full on paranoia (you're recording me, I can't talk because they'll hear it..etc etc) to just a normal lady that was super embarrassed and apologetic to me ( I had to reassure her several times that I don't mind, and that I was just happy it was only a UTI and not ACTUALLY a psychotic break).

Nothing scandalous was happening, but only because we hadn't gotten there yet. At that point we were lying on our sides, facing each other. That was when my now husband made the move to get his arm out from under his body, so he could hug me to him. In order to get his arm out, he needed to sort of rock his body one way, then yank his arm the moment his body lifted. \n\nI was completely unaware he was doing this. So just as he rocked over and yanked his arm free, I turned into him. His hug turned into a punch to the face. And he's a big strong guy, so he hit me hard. My jaw swelled up. \n\nWhen I got home my mom made some sort of joke about my injury. I was like \"I very clearly got punched in the face, you aren't going to ask any questions??\" My mom said \"If Michael did it, you deserve it, that man is amazing.\"\n\nWhile absolutely 100% true, I was a little bit startled that she would believe the best, especially if I didn't even give him the benefit of the doubt first. She had absolutely no doubts. Even looking at my obviously punched face, with swollen knuckle marks. I don't know why that surprised me, knowing everyone, but it did.",

The day before, everyone on the cast was given brand new LAV microphones (the wire mics that you tape to your face). Unfortunately, I didn't know this. See, the old mics were only activated by the sound director, meaning it only worked if a switch on the sound board was flipped. The new ones, however, turn on automatically when you pass a certain area on stage. I think you can kind of see where this is going. \n\nSo anyways, there was one part where I had to strip my costume (button-down shirt and khakis essentially) and change into a very pg-13 toga costume, then put my original costume back on as quickly as possible. So after I get up on stage, do my cute little toga thang, rush back offstage to return to my original outfit. Once I was offstage, I began changing directly in front of the door I had just exited. This was because I had forgotten that someone else had to get on stage before I returned. So this asswipe rushes past me, and with the force of Thor Almighty, and swings the door wide open, exposing my asscheek to THE ENTIRE CAST AND A GOOD 40% OF THE AUDIENCE. I freaked the fuck out and turned into [Patrick fucking Star](https://youtu.be/Kaqa2N_O-KE) as I ran to shut the door. Here's the FU. \n\nSo here I am, half naked, shivering, super embarrassed, I reached out to grab the doorknob. I made eye contact with the guy who had just made me flash all these poor people, and I instinctively gave him a good ol' fashioned American \"MOTHERFUCKER!\". I swear to fucking god the door stretched as I was reaching for the doorknob, because next thing I know, I was on stage, PANTS STILL DOWN, and heard a sea of gasps flood the auditorium. Turns out the mic boundary was just barely passed where I was standing. So yes, the cast, the crew members above and behind me, as well as the 860+ wonderful audience members heard me loud and clear. On top of that, I didn't just say it, I screamed, so that shit echoed and bounced off the walls like crazy. Here's what it was like from the audiences perspective:\n\n\"Say, do you like canned salmon?\"\n\"I'm quite fond of it, yes.\"\n*door opens*\n\"Oh, there he is! This is my husb-\"\n*skinny Asian boy with red boxers waddles on stage*\n\"MOTHERFUCKER^fucker^^fucker^^^fucker!\"\n*door slams*\n\"....Well....how do you do Madame?\"\n\nSafe to say I'll never be in another production at my school again. \n\nTL;DR- I unintentionally flashed like 200 people, then waddled with my pants at my ankles to close the door, screamed a vulgar word, and became the most infamous theatre student at my school. \n\nIn words of the old Western prospectors: GOLD! YEEE-HAWWW!!! Thanks, Stranger!\n\nEDIT- ok I don't know how mics work, sorry!\nANOTHER EDIT- If you know who I am, shhhhh \nAND ANOTHER- numbers. ",

During a performance at the Royal Opera House in London (80s-90s I believe) there was a particularly complicated stage change, during which a timpanist in a studio offstage had to play a drum roll for the entire change. His signal to begin was a light turning red, and he was off the hook when his light turned green again. There was a problem with the stage chance, taking an additional 10 minutes or so, which the poor timpanist played through without stopping, and when he got the green light to stop, the technician forgot to turn off his microphone. The whole theatre heard his \"Thank Fuck for that\" boom out as soon as the stage was lit again.\n\n2. During a theatre performance (I believe) in London (again, 80s-90s ish), there was a scene where an actor mimed playing the piano, and a pianist in a studio offstage was to play. This particular night, the pianist's partner had joined him in the studio, and they were signing Gregorian Chant together, and missed the pianist's cue! When the actor began to sit down and play, suddenly the sound of two men singing burst out for the audience to hear. I believe the actor immediately improvised and started pretending to sing instead or something along those lines.",

            "        Oh my god this reminds me of when I was in high school theatre. Our director was this super smart physics teacher whome also carries a passion for the theatre.  He was a nice enough guy but definitely took his job directing a high school musical WAY too seriously. Anyway one day we are about to start a rehearsal when our heavy brained, and heavy gutted, director decides to step away for a bathroom break. This was a dress rehearsal so yes he had a wireless mic on him. \n\n       The stage director took over in going over the notes from the previous rehearsal. Her string of conversation was broken by the sound of our heavy set physics master working his belt loose through his massive gut. We finally hear the belt buckle loosen followed by a grunt of relief. Of course we in the theatre had stopped everything we were doing, unable to understand what we should be doing; covering our ears, running to tell him? It all seemed so futile at this point. There was a pause in the sound of him through the massive speakers before a brisk unzipping noise followed by a loud *PPPPPPPPPPIIIIIISSSSHHHHHHHHH* with all the high point noises included. The shivers, the waggling dry, everything. Needless to say it was an awkward musical, even more than musicals already are, from that point forward.\n\nEDIT: forward not foreword ",

        "selftext": "A couple months ago, it was date night with my bf and I was PUMPED to finally relax after a rough week. My boyfriend (who asked to be called Magnum here \ud83d\ude44 \ud83d\ude44so I'll refer to him as M) and I ended up making stuffed crust pizza. With grilled onions, sausage, and a fuck ton of cheese, it looks fucking amazing. So does M, so while waiting for it to bake, we head back to the bedroom to do things.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter blowing him, I pulled off to swallow, but I couldn't -- my jaw was locked wide open!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSuper embarrassed, I ran into the bathroom to get his cum out of my mouth. It was still stuck in the back of my throat, but I couldn't swallow or spit, so I tilted my mouth forward to allow his baby gravy to slowly drip out my mouth into the sink.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe try everything\u2014forcing my jaw shut with hands, aggressively wiggling it, massaging, praying to Jesus to forgive me for my premaritial sins, but it's still stuck wide open. Trying to make a little more tolerable, I took ibuprofen with wine, dumbly forgetting I can't swallow. So there I was, choking on his semen, wine, pills, and drool uncontrollably flowing out of my mouth. To make matters worse, M eats the pizza in front of me, it smells delicious, and obviously I can't have any.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt \\~4am, we give up the home remedies and Uber to the ER. I attempt to explain my situation to the receptionist with my mouth wide open and drool dripping onto my shirt. She's probably like, \"why is this guy taking advantage of this poor retarded girl?\" I write down that I'm nauseous and worried I'll die from sucking dick and choking on my own vomit, and get seen pretty quickly. We end up with an audience of about \\~5 other curious doctors while this guy inspects my jaw.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne asks, \"How did this happen?\"\n\nMe: ...\n\nAnother doctor: \"Did you yawn?\"\n\nMe: ...uh...yeah...\n\n\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne doctor massages my neck while the other one sticks his hands into my mouth and pushes my back teeth back. It hurts like a bitch\u2014this guy's applying his whole body weight into my teeth and I can feel his arms shaking as he leans into me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut then!! Suddenly everything feels right again. It's all in place!!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe go home and the pizza is STILL good the next morning, and everything is okay. Well, besides having to send an ER bill home to my parents and explain that it was from dislocating my jaw :( M looked awfully smug the whole time, but I appreciated him coming w me to the ER and letting me drool all over him\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Dislocated my jaw by sucking dick. I had to go to the ER at 4am, watch my bf eat the pizza we made together when I couldn't, and publicly humiliate myself\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: wow this hit the front page, can't bleieve this is my claim to fame",

Replies here seem to support that it was most likely 6 based on the young-earth theory.\n\nObligatory this happened as a kid.\n\nSome quick back story -- I was raised in an affluent/educated urban area, but all of my Mom's extended family are super country and live on farms. Most of my cousins are home schooled, but I always assumed this was just because the school systems suck there (they do suck). I enjoyed going to see my Grandparents cause I got to play with my cousins (only child) and spend time outside on the farm. We would mostly just drive down there for holidays or during the summer.\n\nOn one of my visits to Grandma's, our uncle took me and my little cousin to a big gun show/flea market type thing.\n\nWe were looking through this vendor who had a bunch of fossils, shark teeth, stuff like that. I thought it was really cool and pointed out a fossilized shark tooth. Underneath it, the description said something like 'this fossil is over 4 million years old'.\n\nI showed my little cousin (she was 10). She got this really cheeky grin like she had some big secret, looked at me, and very matter of factly said 'This isn't real, the Earth is only 2,000 years old'.\n\nI thought she was joking, so I laughed a bit and asked what she meant. She explained that she was 100% confident the Earth was only 2,000 years old, because she learned it in school and it was even in her textbook; therefore it must be true.\n\nI started explaining...well, science... to her, and she kept insisting it was in her textbook; that evolution was false. She grabbed our Uncle and explained the situation and wanted him to tell me how wrong I was. He got this really worried look, told us it was time to go and he would explain once we got back to the truck.\n\nThe entire ride home he was tiptoeing around the subject, explaining we are taught different things in school; and finally settled on 'Well, God's time is different than our time, so when the Bible says 2,000 years; that's in God's time. For us, that's a lot longer, maybe millions of years. So you are both actually correct.\"\n\nYeah, I knew my cousin was home schooled, but had no idea her textbook was called 'The Science of Creation', and she was literally being taught that evolution/science was false; and only what is said in the Bible is fact.\n\nOnce her dad (my OTHER Uncle) found out about the whole thing, he accused me of being a bad influence on my cousin (a year earlier I got in trouble for letting her hear a Jazz CD, and mentioning Harry Potter, which is witchcraft and satanic apparently).\n\n**I was never allowed to play with her again during any of my visits to grandmas, out of my Uncle's fear I would corrupt her.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR - Was forced to stop spending time with my cousin as a kid because I told her about Science.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit 2: Holy shit guys, thanks so much for getting this to the FRONT PAGE of Reddit!** I never expected the post would get so much attention, but 9th top post overall, WOW!\n\n**Edit 3: Thanks for Gold Award kind stranger!** That's my first gilding ever!",

I went away for college and she lived with her parents and two little brothers 6, 11.\n\nWhen I would visit, we would have zero privacy at her house and car fun was l impossible since we didn\u2019t have cars and she had an early curfew. The only option we had to be intimate was to wait till everyone went to sleep and to hook up in the living room. We couldn\u2019t go to her room because her bed was squeaky AF, her dad would check in once he heard her door and she had no bedroom lock. We hooked up a few times successfully in the living room so it wasn\u2019t that big of a deal. \n\nThe day before our anniversary, I was extra horny and had her sit on my face as I laid down face up on the couch with my dick out. We enjoyed ourselves for about ten min until she gets up suddenly and says her dads name to me out loud. It was strange that she would say his name while I was eating her out and before it hit me I heard his voice say, \u201coh my god, what are y\u2019all doing?! Let me get my bible\u201d he forces my gf in her room and I\u2019m left alone on the couch. \n\nThey are in her room for about 5 minutes and I decide to pray because my parents are strict AF and I know I\u2019m about to be in trouble. As I\u2019m praying I feel a tap on my shoulder. I\u2019m ready for hell but when I turn around its my GFs youngest six year old brother, up at 3am. I was like wtf is going on tonight. Anyways, he asks if I had a tummy ache because of my kneeling praying position. I say no and he literally skips back to bed (I suspected he was gay at 6 and he ended up coming out later in life). \n\nEventually my GF and her dad come out of her room. Here\u2019s where it gets interesting. He sits us down and instead of punishing us, he tells us he understands, that he isn\u2019t mad, that it will be our secret and if my GFs mom finds out we will all be in trouble. He then proceeds to tell us how we should have planned it to avoid getting caught. That\u2019s right, my (pastor) GFs dad explained that we should have left the kitchen light on to divert any late night walkers there and gone to the dining room so we would have had more time to sort ourselves out before anyone walked in. It was strange. \n\nHe sits us in the dining room, tells us to have fun and goes back to bed. I\u2019m still shaken up by what had just happened but with my oral skills at its peak, my GF wanted me to finish. I had to decline and say bye for the night before seeing her and her dad for our one year anniversary the next day (he took us to get pictures at the mall the next day). \n\nTL;DR: eating my GF out on the living room couch and her dad who is a pastor catching us in the act and giving us tips on the right way to avoid detection.\n\nEdit: to clarify that my GFs dad gave tips on how to avoid detection and not how to perform the actual act.\n\nEdit 2: formatting\nWe are no longer together, sadly. Thankfully we ended on good terms and can laugh about it now.\n\nEdit 3: Yes it\u2019s a true story and I mentioned the comment about her little brother because it randomly popped in my head as I was posting. Thinking back, that little detail of him was funny to me. I loved that kid, he was like a little bro to me and so funny. Anyways, his mannerisms even as a little boy just made me suspect he would be gay. After he asked about my tummy he kissed my leg, giggled then skipped off into the night. No offense intended just a funny side note.",

I've been dating my girlfriend for 5 years now, but after about 6 months of dating and for the following year of our relationship she lived in Spain (and me in the US) so obviously very long distance. We got a lot more sexually intimate via text and video calls over that time so when she came back, naturally, we were like horny teenagers, despite being in our early 20s. She moves back home to get her master's and live with her parents. On that SAME DAY I moved to a different state for work. So we were quite sexually frustrated. She has 3 siblings and the two girls share a room and same with the boys, no guest room. I come back to her house to see her after settling into my new place. I was just supposed to sleep on the couch in their living room because I thought it'd be weird to sleep in her bed in the same room as her sister (plus I wanted to bang super bad). GF and I had be just pushing through the sexual tension all day waiting for everyone to go to sleep. Just before her mom went to sleep, she pulled me aside and basically said, \"I hope this isn't weird, but I just want you to know that GF's dad and I talked and we will not be coming down by any means tonight. I know you guys probably want a private night watching a movie or something.\"\n\nIt was a bit awkward because of the obvious implications, but man did I appreciate that. We were able to have sex on the couch after 14 months of not touching each other (minus the two times I visited her in Spain) and it was so kind of her mom to just let us relax and enjoy that very special moment. I mean it would have been nice if her sister just slept on the couch and gave us the room, but we made it work! To this date, her parents have never once come down after saying goodnight. She's since moved in with me, but I intend on being as understanding as her mom was when we have kids. Don't treat sex like some sinful act, and allow kids space to experience what you did when you were a teenager while fostering an environment of safety and trust. Her parents are A+. Meanwhile my dad, while growing up, didn't allow me to close any doors. Ever.",

Also, we have ridiculously incredible sexual chemistry.\n\nI hadn\u2019t seen him in about a month and a half as I had been traveling for work. So he comes over today. \n\nOne thing leads to another and we\u2019re in my bed. I\u2019d say that we are both pretty vocal during the deed. There\u2019s a lot of moaning and hyping each other up. So he\u2019s saying things like \u201cI love how you feel\u201d and \u201cyoure beautiful\u201d and I am hitting him back with \u201cyou are so sexy\u201d and \u201cyou feel amazing\u201d.\n\nThe scene of the fuckup: \nSo he\u2019s on top. I have my legs pretzeling him. My hands are cupping his neck and he is kind of doing the same. He says, \u201clook at me...\u201d\n\nSo I do.\n\nAnd in my mind I am like I should say something dirty because we are staring into each other\u2019s souls and it\u2019s ridiculously sexy. \n\nBIG MISTAKE. \n\nFor the record...he kept saying things like \u201cI love how you feel\u201d or whatever and so I was going with the same grammatical construction. \n\nAnd so I am staring him dead in the eye, as he is basically leg locked inside of me, and I tried to ask \u201cdo you love fucking me?\u201d \n\nEXCEPT IT CAME OUT AS \n\u201cDo you fucking love me?\u201d\n\u2620\ufe0f\u2620\ufe0f\u2620\ufe0f\u2620\ufe0f\u2620\ufe0f\n\nTo which I realize what I just said and start frantically trying to explain that it\u2019s not what I meant to say, and it\u2019s definitely not a subconscious slip because obviously I don\u2019t love him, but I do like him. \n\nBless his heart, that he just sort of laughed it off and went back to work.\n\nIf he ever wants to see me again, I\u2019ll be surprised.\n\nTLDR; TIFU by trying to talk dirty but accidentally asking the man I like if he loves me, not my \ud83d\ude3b.",

        "selftext": "About two months ago I was watching porn and found a girl who looked like my wife, which I'm into so I clicked on it. As I watched it I started to think it might actually be my wife, then I turned up the volume and listened close and I start to panic. It sounds and looks just like my wife, my heart starts pounding. My stomach dropped to the floor when she looked at the camera in this moment I am convinced. Luckily at the very end of a short clip there was a like a three frame shot at the end that obviously wasn't her but I couldn't get it out of my head. I kept watching and listening and slowed it down and with the exception of those last frames it really seemed to be her. Anyways after I finished my business I just sat and waited for my wife to come home, all the while telling myself things like it's not her you're being stupid. I couldn't leave it alone so I tried looking up the actress but couldn't find the info. \n\nFinally my wife came home and I had to show her the clip. First she laughed, then she gasped when the girl looks up. She started to tear up and asked if perhaps she'd been drugged or something. After further inspection and some comparison of identifying markers like birthmarks and the like we concluded that it's not her but someone who looks and sounds extremely similar. I'm still trying to find out who the girl is because I'm hoping there may be some fun things to watch like a good lesbian scene. For a good hour there I thought that my marriage of ten years might have been a sham. The good thing is that it made me realize how much I love my wife and how important she is to me and my life. \n\ntl;dr thought my wife was cheating on me in porn movie, almost had a heart attack, turned out to be her dopplegangher\n\n\nEdit; The shot is of her profile and for a moment she looks up, then back to profile and a quick look up again.  The whole clip is about a minute and a half long. It's not a professional porno it's a clip from a webcam show not at a great quality. Had the angles or quality been better the whole thing could've been avoided. \n\nYes, married men watch porn, I can't believe how many people asked about that. \n\nYes I'm sure it's not her. \n\nNo,  i won't be posting the source. On the off chance someone figures out who i am, i don't want give someone i know the link to a porn that looks just like my wife.\n\nEdit2; What I've learned from this thread is that this is a pretty common thing to happen.  \n\nAlso, to all the girlfriends in denial, idealistic 12 year olds and Christian conservatives.  Masturbation is not cheating,  neither is watching porn. Believe me, your boyfriends and husbands are much better off watching porn than being left to their own thoughts. You can have sex twice a day and still want to wank it sometimes. Just because you have a steak in the fridge doesn't mean you won't just want the ease and quick satisfaction of a bologna sandwich from time to time.\n\nEdit3; Nobody will see this last edit but i feel like this point should be made.  If a vegetarian watches a video of someone eating a bacon sandwich and thinks that it looks tasty and enjoyable,  does that mean they're no longer a vegetarian? \nI don't think so.  Being attracted to other women does not make a man a cheater, that to me requires physical touch or emotional intimacy. If one can be condemned for their thoughts then there is no hope for any of us.",

            "I had a similar situation when watching porn about lesbian vampires. \n\nIt was so frightening . . . it scared the sperm right out of me.",
            "Something like this happened to me!\n\nTLDR; my boyfriend saw a porno saved to my computer, thought it was me, I came home early from work, proved it wasn't, gave us both heart attacks.\n\n\n Me and my boyfriend both watch porn, not together, but separately. I have a laptop that we both use and I call it a family-friendly laptop because occasionally my dad will borrow it. (Both of my grandparents are in their 90's and he has made several slideshows celebrating their birthdays\\60 year marriage\\family reunions type stuff.)\nMy boyfriend was using the laptop one day and there was a video that was downloaded twice. He opened it up and it was a short, amateur filmed porno. It was a little fuzzy, but the girl that happened to be blindfolded in the video looked like me. I happen to be at work when I got a call from my boyfriend asking me about it very aggressively. He asked me who the fuck was this guy, he said it was definitely me, it looks like me and sounds like me. He tells me not to play dumb and he knows exactly what I'm talking about. And my red and black plaid long-sleeve is on the floor next to them fucking. (First of all, everyone owns a red plaid shirt) I of course have no idea what he is talking about but I could tell how crazy enraged he was and I was so panicked from him yelling at me and me just being completely clueless on what he is talking about.\nI couldn't let him go the rest of my shift thinking that I was this girl in this video and him thinking I cheated. So I left work for a \"medical emergency\".\nI get home and I'm watching this video, I guess she does kind of look and her moans sound like me... I guess? but it was difficult to get a good image. The video looked up from the girl and looked around the room. I do not recognize this room. I start to question myself thinking if I was drunk and don't remember or whatever. Maybe the guy was recording without my permission.\nFinally, after watching the video 50 ficking times and pausing and playing through each damn frame, I noticed the girl has bangs, I do not have bangs. She also has  two moles on her butt, I do not.\nI screenshot these frames and call my boyfriend back over.he knows damn well what my butt looks like but still has me pull my pants down to check for any moles on my butt. He realizes that the girl is not me and comes out of his panic attack. he asked me why I downloaded the video. I have no recollection of this, I do not use the laptop for porn usage. The only thing I could possibly think of is I clicked on a video file my phone skipped or was buffering and I accidentally downloaded it, And my accounts which are linked, saved it to the laptop. (I don't even know if that is possible, I'm not very tech savvy.)\n\nAt the end I was really pissed off I had to come home from work, I got a warning about my \"occurrences\" (being late, forgetting to clock out, leaving work early, all counts against us.) and I was still kind of salty about my boyfriend screaming at me or the phone for no reason. The video has been deleted and everything is back to normal.",

        "selftext": "As is normal it seems, this actually happened about a year ago now.\n\nIm a 30ish year old male. My wife was 9 months pregnant at the time so I hadn't gotten any action in a while. Her choice, not mine. My wife is the only person I have ever slept with. We started dating in high school.\n\nSo on with the story.\n\nI have always got my haircut at costcutters or sportsclips. The cheap places because I didn't really care. My wife had been going to a salon local to us for the last few years for massages, haircuts, hair color, the works. I had a bad experience at sportsclips the last time, I just didnt like the results. So she made me an appointment at her salon for me.\n\nI showed up and was in their waiting room. The stylist comes to get me and wow, she is VERY attractive. Obnoxiously attractive.\n\nAfter I sit in the chair I honestly stopped thinking about it, we were having a good conversation, about my wife actually. Yes, Im a terrible human being. Finish the haircut and go in the back room where they wash everyones hair. As she started to wash my hair I don't know what happened but it felt really good the way she was massaging my head while applying the shampoo. Cue the boner, Thankfully the way I was situated and the robe they had on me hid it pretty well...I think. I had a warm towel over my eyes.\n\nShe finishes that and then she asks if I want a hand massage, I decline because Im a guy and its just kinda awkward, especially given her attractiveness. Her reaction was kinda odd, she seemed shocked I didn't want one. She asked again if I was sure and I felt I might offend her if I said no again so I agreed.\n\nThe hand massage just felt amazing. I don't know what it was but it was incredible. All of a sudden I start getting little twitches in my penis for lack of a less obnoxious word for it. I couldn't stop them, they just kept building.\n\nThen she goes to switch hands, grabs the lotion and puts the bottle down on my stomach, which slides down and ever so slightly touches my penis. That was the final straw and it happened. Next thing I know Im in a full or orgasm and I cant stop it.\n\nI end up crossing my legs to further hide the fact that my penis and groin area are having seizures basically. Im so embarrassed, I had no idea what to do. My semen is soaking into my boxers and it's a terribly gross feeling.\n\nI don't think she knew what was going on, thank god. She finished the hand massage and I have the most awkward walk of my life back to her chair. I basically shut down at that point and tried to rush the rest of the appointment. Im sure I was bright red at this point from embarrassment. We finish the appointment and I go to the cashier to check out. Im an epic moment of good judgement I decide to give her an obnoxious tip on top of it. I think it was $50 on a $50 bill. Yes, I am an idiot and if she did know, I just made it a million times more awkward.\n\nI went home, avoided my wife and went straight into the shower, hid my clothes and put them in the washer right after my shower.\n\nI have never been back and have made due with my subpar haircuts from my local sports clips since. My wife doesn't know. Telling her this story a week from her due date could have gone literally any direction and telling her now would just be even more awkward.\n\nSo there's my story, judge all you want. I am aware I am an idiot and did multiple things to make it worse. I feel like I sexually harassed her or something. I hate myself but not enough to dwell on it lol  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQ&A: Some people took things too literal or didn't get my attempts at humor. Shortened because I realized idgaf about some of the sensitive sallies in this post.\n\nYes, I used the word obnoxious 3 times, and again in my tldr. Now I have used it 5. Sometimes a word gets stuck in my head and I use it too much. May hell rain down on me for my sins.\n\nI did not mean obnoxiously attractive as a bad thing and yes I intentionally used the word wrong. I just found it to be a funny way to describe my reaction. \"She was so attractive it was almost offensive\" maybe would have been better choices? idk, it was a joke.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nParting words as I probably wont be back to this thread. To the people trying to blame my wife for not bending over backwards to make sure I am sexually satisfied, in the best way possible, please piss off. My wife was pregnant and going through a lot. Thinking that she should drop everything to rub one out for me is pretty fucked up. If I was to the point where I needed something I would just rub one out myself like a normal person. I didn't feel sexually deprived, I had much more important things on my mind. Life doesn't revolve around sex for me.  \n\n\nPerhaps I am more sensitive to these things. My wife was the first person who I was attracted to at more than a physical level. The only person I have ever been with. I rarely have physical contact with other women, not because I avoid it, it just doesn't happen in normal course of life. This changes nothing, I am still more attracted to my wife than any human being. Attraction is about more than physical appearance. My wife is hot af, but her personality is even more attractive to me.  \n\n\ntldr; My wife talked me into a haircut at a fancy salon. Stylist was obnoxiously attractive. I had an orgasm while she was giving me a hand massage. I then proceeded to leave a 100% tip because I am an idiot.",

        "selftext": "Obligatory this didn\u2019t actually happen today and I\u2019m using a throwaway for reasons that will become clear below. A few months back, a young family member passed away unexpectedly. A social media post was put up about it, and it went viral. There were lots of kind people who commented nice and sometimes even helpful things, but there were also several with more maligned intentions: first spammers, then a few people who just wanted to speculate wildly about cause of death in very hurtful and insane ways, and then the anti-vax community descended on it.  The latter collectively wanted us to know that they \u201cknew\u201d what happened, that we could \u201cunderstand the tragedy\u201d better if we just talked to them. \n\nAll of this was a lot to process in my grief, and I started going through comments and reporting them. My anger level rose and before long I convinced myself that if I just messaged them and told them that the autopsy showed something 100% unrelated, that they\u2019d lay off. That we would maybe even get an apology. As I wrote the first message, I convinced myself that people are decent and they just misunderstood probably. I continued writing to a few others. \n\nYeah.... couldn\u2019t have been more wrong about that. I got back messages from each with different insane takes on it. Then I started getting messages from other people I\u2019ve never heard of. \n\nAt the private, unannounced service, two women came up to me in the parking lot wanting to hug. I assumed they were from the other side of the family, people I\u2019d met but I just wasn\u2019t immediately recalling them, so I obliged. They expressed their sorrow, asked a few questions, and then began explaining that they had \u201cresearch\u201d that they\u2019d like to share. One pulled out pages of handwritten notes about the dangers of vaccinations and how it relates to the deceased. Thankfully the employees of the funeral home helped me dispense of them quickly at least. \n\nI continued getting messages on social media and later learned that my info had been spreading from one social media group to another along with the any details they\u2019d gleaned about the death from me. I eventually started getting phone calls even, though my phone number isn\u2019t out there in any easy to find place.  One person went to the length to write up over 20 pages of \u201cfacts\u201d about the death including a section on how my loved one\u2019s death can further their cause politically. I couldn\u2019t even be mad; at least she was honest in her intention unlike the others. It\u2019s been months, and still I\u2019m being hounded almost every single day by crazies all over the country. \n\nI\u2019ve learned my lesson and don\u2019t respond or acknowledge them in any way now, nor have I for a while.  I haven\u2019t mentioned this to any of my family members because we\u2019re all so broken right now and this is way too much on top of it; I just hope none of them are getting the same treatment. \n\nTL;DR Anti-Vaxxers have been trying to ruin my life since I tried to reason with them after the passing of a loved one\n\n\nEdit - A few takeaways:\n* To those that reached out with similar experiences, I have been mortified to learn that this wasn\u2019t unique to me. Thank you for trusting me with your thoughts and stories.  I wish each of you the very best. \n* To those that reached out who have also lost a loved one recently, thank you. Genuinely. That\u2019s a brave thing to talk about with a stranger online, and it\u2019s been really healing for me to have conversations with so many of you. \n* I regret the user name I chose for this post and the wording of my TL;DR. I do believe in vaccinating but am sad to realize my words were a catalyst in spurring so much hatred towards those who don\u2019t.  The people that doxxed me are on the extreme fringe of that group, and that has become even more clear to me reading comments and messages from some of you.  I\u2019m going to try to parlay this whole experience of wishing for more kindness from strangers during a tough time to trying to be as kind as I can be to strangers (and everyone else for that matter),  online and otherwise.",

During the grieving process, my sister (a known and practicing armchair diagnostician with no qualifications), said to me. \"Well you know, I think your child was autistic\".\n\nI had to look at my own sister and question her medical qualifications. How dare she? She did. She was and is, in no way qualified to diagnose anything at all. I dressed her down and she was crying. I shared my son's medical history with her. We no longer speak. I got fed up with her diagnoses and etc. after fifteen more years of that sort of thing.\n\nWhat made her cry? I told her that I did not care if he was autistic, had epilepsy, had cancer, was disfigured, was physically disabled or whatever. And, I asked her why she felt that she needed to be the expert or the center of attention so badly, that she would malign a deceased child without knowing him at all, to get people to look at her as an expert. I said that I loved him for who he was, and I did not care.He was mine. He was a part of my soul and he took part of it with him. I told her she needed to shut up.\n\nShe replied that she hadn't said any of those things were wrong with him. I said,' \"Exactly. There was nothing wrong with him. But, you needed to assert you \"expertise\"'. and I, the calm sister, the always professional sister, the one who calmed her dramatic displays and etc., told her to go fuck herself. I said nothing was wrong with him. He was a person with qualities and flaws. He was perfect.\n\nI know that these women will continue to spread that ignorant and venemous nonsense.

Normally, I use a trimmer with no gaurd because it's fast and trying to manuver a razor back there is far too risky. I do this every couple of weeks or so.\n\nThe downside to this method is that it doesnt get super close and leaves a a little butt stubble. I was lamenting this fact to my wife when she lit up and offered up a genius solution. \"You should let me nair your butt.\" Said she, with a gleam in her eyes. \"Its easier than a trimmer and it will make your butt super smooth.\"\n\n\"Well, okay.\" Says I.\n\nElated, she runs to grab the tube, sits down face level with my butt and goes to town with a little more fervor than you would expect for someone tasked with rubbing cream on a hairy man butt. Marriage is strange. A few minutes later, I wash it off in the shower and we gush over how baby-smooth things are down there. I mean a baby dolphin would be jealous of this thing. It was like silk and rubber got together for a night of sweet love and produced an offspring. I finally understood what that Santara song was about. All was good in the world. Or so I thought.\n\nThe next day I noticed some slight itchiness, but I figured it would pass, so I just tried to ignore it and focused on not scratching it as best as I could. Later that night, my wife and I got undressed and got in the shower together. We were having an unrelated conversation, when I remembered the itchiness I had been feeling throughout the day and told her about it. \"Well turn around so I can take a look.\" So I turned around, stuck it out, and awaited her analysis.\n\n...\n\nDead silence. \n\nI turned back around to find her with her hands over her mouth trying her hardest to hold in a laugh. I craned my neck and twisted my body to try to get a view myself, and I was met with a horrifying sight. Like a thief in the night, somone had stolen the silky smooth booty that was there just mere hours before and replaced it with one that was COVERED in huge, bright red bumps. Unable to contain it any longer, my wife busted out laughing, while I jumped out of the shower to inspect it closer in the mirror. Overnight, it had gone from glorious, shimmering dolphin fin to 14 year old getting slapped in the face by puberty.\n\nMy wife maintains the hypothesis that it was an alergic reaction to the hotel soap possibly somehow exacerbated by the nair, as I did get a few small bumps on other parts of my body, but nothing like the warzone that my backside now looks like.\n\nI maintain that it was sabatoge because she was jealous and wanted to have the only smooth bum in the house.\n\nMoral of the story: never challenge a woman's rightful status of smoothest booty. \n\nTL;DR: I let my wife nair my butt and now it looks like Freddy Kruger face fucked a topographical map of Utah.",

He screams out from the bathroom, \"Hey, Clumsy, is it supposed to feel like this?\"\n\nHe didn't sound overly concerned or anything, so I ask him what it feels like.  He can't describe it to me.  I tell him if it is even anything remotely like pain he needs to get it off RIGHT NOW.\n\nGuy decides... 'Nahhhhh it's not THAT bad' and keeps it on for ANOTHER FIVE MINUTES.\n\nWhen he finally did go to rinse everything off, several layers of skin went, too.  We didn't have enough gauze to cover the area, and couldn't stop the bleeding right away, so I helped him get into the loosest pair of sweatpants I could find and had to practically drag him down the stairs to the car.  Loaded him in the back seat, apologized like fuck every time I hit a bump and he whimpered.  It was awful.\n\nThankfully he had no permanent scarring or loss of function, although I was certain that was going to occur.  He spent the next week splayed out in a computer chair with no pants on, had to call off work and everything.  I think it took about 2 months for him to be able to walk in clothes without pain.\n\nTl;Dr KEEP CHEMICALS OFF YOUR BALLS",

Through the haze of tears I struggled out of the bathroom across the hall into the kitchen, by this time walking was not really possible and I crawled the final yard to the fridge in the hope of some form of cold relief. I yanked the freezer drawer out and found a tub of ice cream, toe the lid off and positioned it under me. The relief was fantastic but only temporary as it melted fairly quickly and the fiery stabbing returned. Due to the shape of the ice cream tub I hadn\u2019t managed to give the starfish any treatment and I groped around in the draw for something else as I was sure my vision was going to fail fairly soon. I grabbed a bag of what I later found out was frozen sprouts and tore it open trying to be quiet as I did so. I took a handful of them and an tried in vain to clench some between the cheeks of my arse. This was not doing the trick as some of the gel had found its way up the chutney channel and it felt like the space shuttle was running its engines behind me.\n\nThis was probably and hopefully the only time in my life I was going to wish there was a gay snowman in the kitchen which should give you some idea of the depths I was willing to sink to in order to ease the pain. The only solution my pain crazed mind could come up with was to gently ease one of the sprouts where no veg had gone before.\n\nUnfortunately, alerted by the strange grunts coming from the kitchen the other half chose that moment to come and investigate and was greeted by the sight of me, arse in the air, strawberry ice cream dripping from my bell end pushing a sprout up my arse while muttering \u201cooooohhh that feels good\u201d Understandably this was a shock to her and she let out a scream and as I hadn\u2019t heard her come in it caused an involuntary spasm of shock in myself which resulted in the sprout being ejected at quite some speed in her direction. I can understand that having a sprout fired against your leg at 11 at night in the kitchen probably wasn\u2019t the special surprise she was expecting and having to explain to the kids the next day what the strange hollow in the ice cream was didn\u2019t improve my status\u2026so to sum it up, VEET removes hair, dignity and self-respect. !\n",

HORRIBLE IDEA. CHEMICAL BURN ON MY NIPPLES. \n\nI didn't break the date but told the guy he could not play with my breasts. He whined that he wanted to play with my breasts.

It was also after a couple of drinks so we were going at it pretty rough.\nSo here I am, on my knees, giving him a blowjob, putting my back into it when all of a sudden I hear a very loud *POP* immediately followed by one of the worst pain I ever felt. It felt as if someone stabbed me in the face with a screwdriver. \n\nThanks to my godlike reflexes I was able to yank my head away from the one eyed yogurt slinger before my teeth snapped together and with that momentum I also managed to slam my head into the nearest wall. I was already in tears from the shock of the sudden pain when I realised.. I can't move my jaw. I started to panic and just kept repeating \"I can't open my mouth! I can't open my mouth!\".\n\nWe tried to pry it open while under hot water, thinking it was a muscle cramp but that shortly, with some pain I can't even start to describe, revealed that it indeed was not just some stiff muscle... \n\nYup, I managed to dislocate my jaw while giving a blowjob.\n\nIn a futile attempt to snap it back where it belongs, I tried punching myself in the face on the opposite side, tried pushing it, pulling it with all my might but none of that seemed to work. At the end after many tears and pain and panicked running in circles, I took a painkiller and wrapped myself in a blanket to think through my options. I ended up falling asleep like that for a few hours. \n\nWhen I woke again, with the pain a bit duller and my mind a bit clearer I finally managed to pop my jaw back where it belongs but the pain is still very bad and I can't open my mouth more then to fit a teaspoon neither can I close it completely. It being Sunday, only emergency trauma care is accessible in the hospital and it is insanely crowded so I decided to wait till tomorrow to seek medical attention. So here I am now, popping painkillers and eating my dinner with a straw, having absolutely no idea what I am going to say to the doctor or how do I explain to my boss why I need a day off in such short notice.\n\nTl,Dr: i went for a blowjob, ended up like the T-Rex after King Kong was done with it.\n\nEDIT/UPDATE: first of all... Holy sh** this blew up! I'm glad I could make so many of you chuckle. Also, I've read the comments, thanks for the laughs, it hurt.\n\nTo answer a couple topics I found in the comments: sadly, nobody came that day. \n\nWhat was boyfriend doing, well, he tried to call an ambulance after he realised we are not equipped to fix the issue. Problem is, my country is not very big on English and my boyfriend doesn't speak the local language. First operator hang up on him when realised he is trying to communicate in English, second operator got stuck on not understanding the address code in English... I then insisted to \"f**k that, it'll be fine\".\n\nI am not from the us, just very stupid. Health care is included in taxes but did not rush to the ER because they are under staffed, under payed and over worked an I was not bleeding, seriously disabled or in mortal danger, neither did I think a dislocated jaw is serious enough to require immediate care, tho reading your horror stories and warnings made me concerned.\n\nAfter a brief ~4 hours spent at the clinic I was called into a large room where five dentists were working on five different patients with not as much as a curtain separating them so the place was loud enough that the doctor did not ask questions because I was not able to answer loud enough. He instructed me to grip the chair tight because it will hurt, pushed my jaw backwards and wiggled it to it's place. Showed me how to stretch the muscles, gave me his number and sent me off.\n\nHopefully it will heal alright and I can go back to finish what I was doing originally.\n\nOh, and bless those who noticed the username. I did make this account to post this story. Wasn't sure how it would look on my main.",

I'm  a straight guy so it could be worse! \n\nA few years after my brush with TMJ, I met people (they had/have an advocacy organization) who had far worse TMJ conditions. Hearing their stories and the changes to their lives brought home how serious TMJ is for some. Ever wonder why some people speak \"oddly\", as though they can't open their mouths? In some cases it's probably TMJ. Persistent pain, eating challenges and altered speech behaviors are some of the lasting challenges.

I don\u2019t know how to safely approach people with the covid situation and I was getting off at the next stop so I made a note telling her I thought she was cute with my number and airdropped it to the name that came up when she took out her phone. She looked at me and smiled (I think, harder to tell with masks) and texted me as I was walking through the station saying that she thought i was cute too. I was excited! Then she asked me how old I was and my heart sank, thinking \u201coh no she\u2019s 19 or 20 or something, younger than I thought\u201d. I told her my age: 29. She then revealed that she\u2019s 15.

Two young men were seated in the middle and aisle seats, both obviously military. (They weren't in uniform, but one could tell. Haircuts, posture, idk.)\n\nAnyway, the guy sitting in the middle seat chatted with me almost the whole flight. Nothing untoward, just very pleasant chit chat.

Up until I was 19ish, I pretty much looked like a 12 year old. Especially with the way my voice sounds, some creepers literally didn't believe me when I told them I was an adult. Of course, the opposite problem was in high school I pretty much exclusively wore sweaters and baggy pants so I subsiquently looked between the ages of 19-25.

As we we're loading up the car we get to talking, trying to figure out if she was flirting. He talks me into going back in to invite her over after she's gets off work to enjoy the wine and cheese she helped pay for.

I right away stopped and asked her how old she was, turned out she was 15. I apologized to her and left.\n\nI immediately went back to my friend group and told them, they ripped on me for it for a little bit but it was all good. Nothing but a moderately embarrassing story now.",

I had done my hair up with rollers and looked amazing, older than normally (I've always looked super super young) and my mum said I probably looked 16.  Even still, once this guy realised exactly how young I was all he did was smile and walk away.   \n\n\nA few years later when I was older, I found myself with a friend in an interview situation with this guy, she went in first, and thankfully I saw who it was. I left and waited for her outside, and told her the story. She said it made sense cause he was super creepy (we were maybe 16 then) I'm just happy I had my mum and grandmother with me to scare the guy off, instead of being out there only with friends. I would get guys who were too old for me hitting on me years later, but that was the one that was definitely in the stay away zone.",

            "TW CW: Heavy topic about assualt. Thank you for your last edit talking about the damaging effects that come with sexual contact between a grown adult and a minor. When I was 16 a school teacher from the next district reached out to me online. He was 45, or so. At the time I was just so flattered to be getting attention from him. What followed was a few months of sexual contact. When it ended it was devastating for me. I had thought it was \"true love.\" Because I was too young to see it as it was. A grown man grooming and manipulating a child. There can be no consent in that dynamic. Teenagers do not have the knowledge and power that an adult has. So while they may see it as consensual at the time, when they get older they'll more than likely resent that person. Or worse, themselves. I know I did. It took a long time in therapy to stop blaming myself. To admit to myself I was a victim. Years of suffering. Because of one man who couldn't just find someone his own age to screw around with. I was going to come out publically, and make a police report. But I saw that he had lost his teaching license. Not sure why, but I assume it was found out what he was doing.. So for those who think \"you should have pursued that 15 year old girl\".. think about the potential harm you are doing to a child who is just now starting their lives.. Think of the set backs you are giving them. Find a consenting adult.",

        "selftext": "Obligatory- the FU happened months ago, but I found out today\n\nApril 2020. 1 month into lockdown, it seemed like we were going to work from home at least until the summer (lol). I decided to invest in a good office chair with lumbar support.\n\nChair arrives, I build it with wifey, and much to my dismay, the seat is angled forward so it feels like you're sitting on the cliff Mufasa fell from. It was impossible to stay seated on the chair without sliding forward and curving your spine in a weird way. I figure it's shoddy manufacturing and incorporate a footstool to my set up so I don't fall from the chair. It's uncomfortable, but I make do with my creation and keep my pride intact.\n\nFast forward to 9 months later, and wifey decides to get a chair of her own. She shows me the chair she picked out and claims that it is much better than my Mufasa chair. Dejected, I pull up my past orders to see the reviews on my chair to see what went so wrong. \n\nMultiple comments on its fantastic lumbar support. It seems no one else is sliding off of this chair. I'm confused. A light bulb flickers in my brain and I hold up a photo of the chair in the Amazon listing next to the real thing.\n\nTurns out the bottom base of the chair frame is reversed in the photo, which meant that I built the chair backwards in April and have been sitting in a reverse chair for 9 months. Laughing uncontrollably, we reassemble the chair and take turns sitting. We now have 2 comfortable chairs.\n\nTLDR: Bought chair in April, seat angle sucks. 9 months later wife makes fun of my chair, discover I have been working from a misassembled chair since the beginning of the pandemic.\n\nEdit: here's the [chair](https://imgur.com/gallery/lHpmkqS) - with an eloquently written review\n\nEdit 2: Several requests for the link to the chair- [here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XDCG988?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share)\n\nEdit 3: Unfortunately, no pictures of the chair before we reassembled. If you see the leg portion of the chair like a sideways U, the concave was facing backwards instead of forwards, tilting the seat forward and flexing in the front.\n\nEdit 4: seems like my final FU in this whirlwind journey was not arranging a kickback with the chair manufacturer before posting. For the 'ride-til-I-die' wheelists, I got a sled chair because we were living in a tiny NYC apartment with cheap floors. My chair preferences also changed after 5 yrs in the military and turning 31. Thanks for the votes and the awards!",

There's a limited amount of chairs that can be assembled like that, but for the ones you can, if you're not paying attention it's seemingly easy enough to do. Enjoy your new found lumbar support!",

I laughed and felt happy that you ultimately ended up with a solution. \n\nI had a similar experience where a review helped me. I got a massaging neck pillow from Amazon.  It honestly was so great. Way better than I expected,  except one thing.  The cord would pop out every 2 minutes if I moved at all! I was about to duct tape the damn thing but for some reason decided to read the reviews where I learned that if you push extra hard the cord snaps and no longer pops out. I've never had it happen again. Yay feedback! Teamwork makes the....you know.",

            "At least you got a chair.\n\nOne of my kids wanted a gaming chair for Christmas. I looked online and decided I wasn\u2019t going to spend $200+ on an expensive chair for a seven year old, and instead looked for a cheaper option. Found what looked like the perfect gaming chair for $65. In the picture it looked really nice. I usually am a stickler for reading reviews but for some reason I didn\u2019t for this one. Got a huge flat package in the mail a few days later and had no idea what it could be. Opened it to find a plastic floor mat for a gaming chair. In my defense, the picture showed a really nice looking chair sitting on the mat, and I didn\u2019t look at the title closely enough to realize what I was actually buying. Had no idea a plastic mat would be that expensive either.\n\n[This is what I saw.](https://www.google.com/search?q=floortex+gaming+esports&rlz=1CDGOYI_enUS885US887&hl=en-US&prmd=sinv&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwja_-Tbk6fuAhVKEawKHSjLB9YQ_AUoAnoECAIQAg&biw=414&bih=622&dpr=3#imgrc=aVE4WjAv9xCXNM) It clearly says it\u2019s a floor mat. I just glanced at the title and thought the thing about floors meant the wheels on the bottom worked on certain carpet types. Anyway. Thought about keeping it but not for that price. I sent it back.",
            "I was at a friend's house and commented on how low her couch was. As we are both tall I thought it was odd she would purchase a couch that felt so uncomfortable. She said it felt higher in the showroom but it took 3 months to make and she liked it so hadn't sent it back.\n\nI used to work in a furniture showroom and immediately flipped the couch over, unzipped the little integrated bag that they use to transport the legs and had them screwed on in under 5 mins. They had sat on their low couch like that for 3 years because they didn't read the instructions on delivery.",

            "A few months ago I got a stainless steel fountain for my cat to drink water. I thought I followed the instructions correctly but it wasn't shooting the water up high enough to be a fountain. So I got a replacement pump. Same issue, my wife looked up a video and asked about a price for the pump. I kept saying it was a packing peice to keep it from broken. Nope, it allowed the water to shoot up through the top! I even asked for a replacement one to be sent to us...",

Luckily for him I had bought my husband the same one about 3 years back so when he told me that it was sloping like that I knew it didn't seem right. Took me a week to get around to taking a look at it but figured it out pretty quick because I had my husband's to compare to. I'm glad you finally fixed it and now it's comfy!",
            "I just acquired a chair from my adult daughter. It was so uncomfortable because it was leaning forward. After reading your post, I turned it upside down and reversed the way the base was attached. So much more comfortable!",
            "I had a similar situation back then but instead of a chair it was a fan.  we spent a good 10 minutes or so wondering why there was no wind coming out of the front, I looked at the picture on the box and realized the blade was facing backward on the fan we just set up so the air was coming out of the back. \n\nHad a good laugh with our stupidity that time",

            "Stephen King is my absolute favorite author, to the point I buy all his books as soon as they are on sale. One time on Amazon I saw a book by Stephen King I had never heard of. Dismayed I missed the release, I quickly dropped it into my cart. Two days later I get the book and grab a blanket and a cup of coffee and settle in my favorite spot for an afternoon of fiction. Two pages in and my eyebrow raises, because I\u2019m noticing error after error in the grammar. One chapter in and I\u2019m frustrated with the juvenile plot and dissatisfied with the over use of descriptive words. I am hoping and praying it gets better. Start of chapter two and I notice the writing is not only shoddy, but the main character all of a sudden has a different name! I open up Amazon to leave a shit review and notice, for the first time, the middle initial K. Some punk ass published a book with nearly the same name as one of the most famous authors alive today and didn\u2019t even try to put out something people might want to read. I bet he had his 12 year old write it. A quick glance at the reviews and it\u2019s obvious I\u2019m not the only one he\u2019s duped. Guys making bank on someone else\u2019s name. I will always check reviews from now on!",
            "If it makes you feel any better, I work in an office supply store.  We offer to build the chairs we sell for customers for a small fee (nice if you don't have a power tool that can zoom the bolts in and out). A few of my coworkers have made that mistake more than once, and all of our chairs clearly have the front of the seat and the front of the base that bolts into the seat labeled.  You'd think after they did it wrong once, they wouldn't do it wrong ever again, but no.  They still do.\n\nI've also had a few chairs returned because the people got home, built it, and felt like the chair that they thought was amazing in store was suddenly uncomfortable, and I took one look at it and could see it was put together wrong.  I try telling the customer, the customer is adamant there's no way they could have put it together wrong, and it must be that it's not worn in.  I offer to sell them our display, plus the $15 assembly, and we'll fix the one they brought back, but again, there's no way they put it together wrong, so they're not paying the assembly fee.  So we take it back, fix it, and plop it on the floor as an alternate display model for 10% off.",

As I\u2019m unpacking the box, I instantly see there is no paddle, this can\u2019t be possible! Except that this time I tore apart every piece of packing material and found it sandwiched between two pieces of cardboard. No indication on the packaging or booklet. I went back through my trash and found the paddle for the first bread maker too. (Which is good as I never received the one they were supposed to send).",
            "Too funny. I got a new office chair three years ago and put it together. As I was applying pressure to get the hydraulic thing connected it was clearly needing more strength than I had. Rather than get my hubby, the super girl that I am decided she just needed to find a way to put even more pressure. I leaned my entire body hard into it. The piece slipped and I went head first into the wall, leaving a cantaloupe sized dent. \nAnd that\u2019s when I realized my hydraulic piece was upside down.",

Chair is uncomfortable.  I figure it was designed that way to keep people sitting in 'office approved posture' or some such.  I'm at home, if I wanna lean back I'm gonna lean back damnit!\n\nTry a mess of stuff.  Nothing works.  Finally, I scour the internet for an answer.

We blamed it on the other chairs being cheap.\n\nIt took nearly a year, but eventually we put the old office chairs outside with a \"FOR FREE\" sign on them.\n\nMy dad apparently picked them up from in front of the apartment building, reversed the seat and sent us a picture with the description \"Some idiot put these brand new chairs in front of your building with the seats reversed.

Just the comfortable phase of relationship when you no longer worry about being perfect human beings.\nWell, after some cuddling, I noticed that his morning wood wasn\u2019t gone. At all. And even though we had some amazing sex last night, I decided I wanted more. He was just so sexy, laying in his bed, I couldn\u2019t resist.\n\nAfter some teasing, we went to do it. We\u2019re pretty boring, maybe too romantic and really lazy, so we wanted just a classic missionary. Ya know, nothing too wild. But I want it quick and kinda rough.\n\nWhile we were doing it, I\u2019m telling him to speed up, even though I know he is tired from yesterday. And he does.\n\nSuddenly, he tells me he got a cramp in his back. Okay, I thought, it will go away. It will be fine. It\u2019s just a cramp. Let\u2019s continue. Right?\n\nWrong.\n\nHe stopped. His face looked like he was in a lot of pain. His whole body looked like he was in a lot of pain. And he was still  inside of me.\n\nThen he told me:\u201dBabe? I can\u2019t move. It hurts. I think I\u2019m gonna need help.\u201d\n\nWell.\n\nI had to carefully operate myself from under him and take off his condom.

Trying to put his pants up, so he won\u2019t be totally naked when the fucking ambulance I had to call will arrive. The whole time he was almost screaming from pain.\n\nThe REALLY best part? Trying to frantically get rid off all evidence of what we were doing just for him to tell everyone \u201cYeah, I did this to myself during morning sex with my girlfriend.\u201d\n\nNow he is stuck in bed for a week and I\u2019m wondering if my pussy was really worth calling ambulance and all that pain.\n\nTLDR; My vagina apparently feels so good my boyfriend got an acute lumbago in his back while being in it.\n\nEdit: Guys, the TLDR was a sarcasm and a joke.\n\nEdit 2: Aaaand he laughs about it now too. He was the one asking me to cover him so noone else would see him bare naked. He also saw this post before I submitted it (even told me to put it on reddit, because it is kinda funny) and is the one making most jokes about it. At the moment it was terrifying, but now he\u00b4s okay, so why shouln\u00b4t we laugh about it?",

So, there I was- fighting my heart out against this chick who\u2019s a 2nd degree black belt and she was kicking my ass but that\u2019s neither here nor there. So, after the match, my instructor bends down and picks something up off the mat and is holding it in his hand, examining it.

Anyone??...\u201d Apparently, it had fallen out with all the kicking and jumping around, fell down my pants leg, and ended up on the mat!!!

So there's me, standing there, having to open my bag and get it out in front of people and then this vibrator flies out, onto the floor, and starts skittering away across the floor.

To help me get accustomed to my new classmates and not be overwhelmed on my first day, my teacher had me come in early and sit at my desk while the other students came in. While I was nervously awaiting the arrival of my new classmates my teacher walked over and gave me a warning.\n\n\u201cNow, the girl in front of you is a dork. Please don\u2019t make fun of her.\u201d\n\nHearing this, the nine-year-old me instantly came to this poor girl\u2019s defence. The teacher had just called her a dork, and I thought this was extremely mean. So I tried to help this unmet girls aid by showing our camaraderie to the teacher:\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. In fact, I used to be one too!\u201d After admitting this to my teacher I was suddenly overcome with a fear that teacher would think of me as a dork forever, abandoning my plan of trying to help this girl I quickly added, \u201cBut then I grew out of it.\u201d\n\nThe teacher gave me the most puzzled look I have ever seen and seemed like she was about to say more but decided against it and left.All the kids came in and sat down at their desk and I looked up at the girl in front of me and realized I had misheard what my teacher said. The girl wasn\u2019t a dork; she was a dwarf. I had just told the teacher I used to be a dwarf, but I had grown out of it.\n\ntl;dr Misheard the teacher and then told her I used to be a dwarf but grew out of it.\n\n\n\nEdit: I got Gold!

I didn\u2019t think about it too much because my stomach always acts funky because I haven\u2019t had my gallbladder for 5 years now. \n\nThat night my fianc\u00e9 and I decided to sleep nude. Around 3AM I woke up to an upset stomach. I felt something wet in my bed, but just assumed it was sweat. When I went to the bathroom it was straight butt piss. While I was in there, I realized why my bed was wet. I had shit my bed. And then came another realization. I had to clean up my bed, and wake up my fianc\u00e9 and tell him what happened and why I had to change the sheets. \n\nI woke him up and told him was happened. I was about to cry I was so embarrassed. This man has seen me at my literal worst, but nothing could beat this. I felt so nasty.

My ex fiance who passed away on Halloween came with me to the hospital where they thought I had an impacted bowel, no enema or suppositories or near overdose of laxatives for a week were working, my stomach was distended and I was in an extreme amount of pain, my heart was racing.\n\n My fiance held my hand and giggled while they *manually* worked at moving the obstruction (meaning the doctor was knuckle deep in my butthole). He held my hand and giggled while I hovered over the commode and passed what can only be described as the size of three softballs fused together (I was only 100lbs, this thing was like a third of my body weight) and an unnerving amount of blood. He held my hand and laughed so hard he was crying while the doctor came by to see what I had done and his face literally turned white and said \"Jesus fucking Christ you weren't lying when you said you were in pain\". \n\nThen he took the night off work and took care of me because according to him I had given birth and needed to rest. I knew for sure that he was a keeper at that point. \n\nSo if you are engaged, consider any poop based emergencies as a chance to put your relationship through the ultimate test of love.",

Pro tip, if it happened once, your digestive system might not be done screwing with you - get cleaned up, change the bed, and add a folded towel to lay on (under your butt of course) just in case. It has only saved me once, but I was grateful for it. \n\nObligatory \"me too\" story - my wife & I had spent a long weekend at a nice B&B in a resort town.  Mix of rustic and upscale, a VERY nice room in a converted barn on an active farm.   The last night we were there, well, something went wrong in my lower GI. It has happened to both of us a time or two in 26 years of marriage - embarrassing, but as a wise man said, shit happens. Miraculously, only the bottom sheet was affected.  We stripped the bed and rolled that sheet up, leaving it on the floor of the shower, and texted the owner to let her know the problem.  She was understanding and polite, but insisted we pay for a new set of sheets - she said the ones she uses only come in sets, not separates - and honestly at that point I was so embarrassed, I would have paid whatever she asked just to be done with it.",

My wife passed away Feb 28th 2019 and I just want to say that I would still go through every bit of that but it sounds like your man will stick with you as well.  \n\nAnd believe me there will come a time where you will end up having to take care of your man when he is sick and feels like you taking care of him is gross.  My wife did that for me as well when I was sick and helped keep me around when I had a very bad Staph infection that had spread to my torso.  I just got to repay her after she had paid it forward to me.\n\nAnd no worries for me, some days are tough but I have gotten lucky and found someone who helps make me more whole again.  Do everything you can to keep yours and I wish you a long and happy life together.",

            "I had the same thing happen once... my ex-wife had the stomach flu and I had been taking care of her. A few nights later I wake up having to absolutely throw up... at that moment I realized I had already shit the bed, but was too busy rushing for the bathroom. Once I got in there, I alternated between throwing up in the trash can and blasting liquid fecal death juice into the poor toilet. I finally had evacuated everything I could and turned to... an empty TP roll. I left my phone plugged in on my bedside table, so I couldn't text my wife or call her. If I yelled for her it would be loud enough that it would wake the neighbors, so the only thing I could think of was to pull down the shower curtain rod and start knocking on the shower wall (which shared a wall with our master bedroom) until I finally was able to wake her up. She grabbed me TP, threw out the sheets, then made up the bedroom for me... really sweet about it. \n\nHowever I was never again able to comment on her tear-inducing farts without a \"But did *I* shit the bed?\" :D",

She looked at me like \"ooooooooh shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit\".\n\nFast forward to her feeding me an unknown quantity of shrooms and telling me how mindblowing the sex will be. I've got no idea when I switched from sober to losing my shit, but there I was, staring at the words on my t-shirt slowly melting away.\n\nMy tinder date, who was now in full fuck mode, wasn't wasting any time undressing me. However, my attention was elsewhere. There was a hula hoop in the room that I didn't notice before. I couldn't help but stand up and use it. My tinder date couldn't stop laughing at me hula hooping with no pants on. Not gonna lie, I was living my best life at that moment. I never wanted the hula hooping to stop. \n\nMy tinder date was not about that life though. Eventually she grew tired of watching me hula hoop and pulled me back to bed for some fucky fucky. We made out for like 30 seconds before I ended up hula hooping again. My tinder date got frustrated and tossed the hula hoop in the closet. She took off her bra and asked if I wanted to play or hook up.\n\nI said hula hoop.\n\nShe thanked me for wasting her time and her mushrooms before asking me to leave. Now I have to live with the fact that I chose hula hooping over sex.\n\nTL:DR Went home with a girl. Cockblocked myself with a hula hoop.",

Public-speaking anxiety up the wazoo, so I decided to memorize my 17 students' names and faces before the first day of class.\n\nBy Wednesday of the second week, I had everyone's FACE down pat. But everything else in the classroom was an adrenaline-filled blur.\n\nOn that day, students were picking out an advertisement to analyze (flashback to freshmen college English class, everybody). When I opened  up the discussion, I was surprised when one of quieter students (let's  call him David) told me he'd already chosen his ad.\n\nMe, \"That's great, David, which one did you choose?\"\n\nDavid, \"The Wounded Warrior ad.\"\n\nMe, cheerfully oblivious, \"And why did you choose that one, David?\"\n\nThe classroom suddenly goes silent. No one's rustling papers or texting  under their desk anymore. I realize every single wide eye in the  classroom is staring at me or glancing uncomfortably at David. David looks at me, and shifts his legs. His legs. With numbing horror, I  register the glint of metal between his sneakers and the hem of his jeans. David doesn't have any legs. In my state of stage-fright, I'd somehow missed that one of my students is a double-amputee.\n\nThe silence in the classroom deafens.\n\nFinally, David, quietly - \"I lost my legs in the Army, ma'am.\"\n\nTL;DR - Failing to notice his missing legs, I publicly questioned my (Army vet) student's choice to write about the Wounded Warrior Project.\n\n**Edit**: Many incredibly kind people are saying this wasn't a fuck up. But I should have noticed. I walk around and interact with every student. Sure, maybe I accidentally treated David \\*just like any other person,\\* but he got embarrassing unwanted attention from everyone in the room because I was an idiot. But many thanks for the kindness.",

            "Depending on how recent it was everyone else probably felt more awkward about it than he did.  While I don't someone to completely ignore that I use a cane because of accessibility issues, I also don't want to be filled under \"that girl with the cane.\"  \n\nJust try to take a deep breath and do you best to act like it was the minor foot in mouth issue it was and imo you'll be good.",
            "Honestly I'm sure he's probably happy that you knew his name but didn't really notice anything else about him. Everyone else was super sensitive to the fact that he's \"other\". You just treated him like any other student.",
            "Fellow TA / grad student instructor here - this was a much better \"mistake\" to make than (had you known about his legs) going the other way and assuming that \"oh he picked the ad because he's an amputee\" rather than giving him the same presumed agency over his choice as anybody else in the class. You didn't assume that the disabled person HAD to have picked the \"disabled\" ad because he was disabled. He could easily have picked it because he liked the music or imagery, you know?\n\nMaybe your question put him on the spot a bit more than it would have some of the other students, because his reasons for the choice were particularly personal. But any student could have a very personal reason, that they might not be comfortable disclosing in front of the class, for choosing the ad that they did. Again by not making that leap yourself you let it be HIS choice whether to disclose his reasons or deflect (\"oh it's just a cause that's very important to me...\" or even \"I prefer not to say right now\").\n\nYou feel awkward because the situation is inherently awkward and because your self-consciousness is naturally heightened when you are the one \"in charge\" of the room. Not because you did anything egregiously wrong. There is no one way that people with disabilities like to be treated or referred to, and some are fine talking about it and some aren't. So you can't know in advance what the \"right thing\" is to do in this situation; anytime you are getting to know a disabled person there is a bit of an awkwardness to it while you learn their preferences and possibly misstep a few times. This is not the first awkward situation your disabled student has faced, guaranteed, and I doubt that he has gone home ruminating over it the way you are!\n\nIf it was me in your shoes, I might speak to him privately before or after the next class and apologize for putting him on the spot and maybe ask him if, should another situation like that come up in the future, he would prefer if I avoid the subject / avoid calling on him, or be matter-of-fact about it / treat him like anybody else. And let him know that he should never feel pressured to speak about personal subjects he doesn't want to bring up in class, and that I will happily accept \"I'd rather not answer that\" (or similarly respectful wording) if this comes up again.",

I would have been kind and appropriate (had I not instead just written \u201cthat ass\u201d but, here we are.)\n\nNo, I don\u2019t know why my phone autocorrected to \u201cthat ass.\u201d I am glad it makes people think I have a much more interesting life and Google search history than I do!\n\nFinally, the update: \n\nHe sent me back a link to the music video for \u201cMr. Jones.\u201d I do not know if this was also an accidental text or if I\u2019m missing some symbolism here. Counting Crows fans, please advise. \n  \nWe then chatted about the Cleveland Browns as if nothing weird had happened. \n\nIn any case, I decided the universe (and Reddit) was facilitating enough rom-com vibes (and \u201cdon\u2019t be so quick to judge\u201d comments) that I might as well go on one more date with a nice, friendly dude, with, for what it\u2019s worth, a pretty decent butt. \n\nTl;dr I am seeing that ass again.",

            "Mr. Jones is about the Counting Crows frontman, Adam Duritz, and his friend, Marty Jones, sitting at a bar while Jones\u2019s dad, a famous flamenco guitar player, plays. Adam and Marty are too nervous to talk to girls but then muse about how when they\u2019re rich and famous musicians, they will have no trouble talking to girls. The song also touches on Duritz\u2019s mental illness, longingly discussing how when Adam\u2019s famous, he\u2019ll never be lonely, with an undercurrent of him recognizing that that\u2019s not actually true. Ironically, the song did make Adam rich and famous, and surely enough, his struggles with mental illness continued and even worsened, just as he hinted at in the song. Adam went home drunk from the bar and wrote the song. \n\nI\u2019m not sure it has anything to do with butts.\n\nEDIT: I should mention that while the song was very specific to Adam and that night at the bar, it touched on a deeper sense of longing that everyone can identify with \u2014 longing for acceptance, for success, and for that feeling of having \u201cmade it\u201d whatever \u201cit\u201d looks like, and hoping that making it relieves you of whatever your deepest insecurities and sadness in life are.",

No profile contains enough metadata, and no chat contains enough stimuli, to give you an indication of what will happen in person.\n\nA conversation you enjoy can just as easily be dull for the next person, because they are a good conversationalist with everyone and may have a more active libido.\n\nJust do things with each other, if you are looking for companionship, instead of looking for a \"spark\" the first time you meet.

And of course the text in question was to a friend who is blessed with...huge tracts of land.  Luckily we'd known each other for awhile at the time, and she called me up a minute later laughing her ass off and asking if I'd meant to send that.  I had an \"oh fuck!\" moment when I opened the texts and saw it, but it was hard to be mortified for more than a moment when a) she found it hilarious, and b) it *was* hilarious.",

        "selftext": "This morning I fancied a bit of me time. I\u2019d done some exercise and was feeling pretty good about myself. I decided to try something different and bring my vibrator into the shower with me. Kill two birds with one stone and all that! Mistake number 1. \n\nI soaped myself off and fired up my toy. The vibration is quite quiet so I could enjoy myself without my partner in the next room knowing. I decided to lift my leg to get better ahem access... the shower is a small cubicle so not much room for movement so I rested my sole against the wall in front of me and leaned back on the wall behind me. Mistake number 2. \n\nAs things heated up, I seemed to forget where I was. The stream of the hot water and sensational vibrations eventually drove me to the edge. My standing leg began to tremble but I didn\u2019t think too much about it, until the big O hit. I don\u2019t know if was just the difference in location or feeling of standing up masturbating that threw me off, but it was a veryyyy strong orgasm and I felt lightheaded. I must have lost balance because next thing I know the foot beneath me slid forward suddenly and I\u2019m clattering to the shower floor. I hit my head, tried to grab anything at all, knocked the stuff off the shelf and must have cried out a little. \n\nWith all the commotion, my partner came running. Before I could say I was ok don\u2019t come in he ran into the bathroom to help me. It took him a good few seconds to see my vibrator and stared at my crumpled corpse putting two and two together. Needless to say his look of concern turned to amusement as he burst out laughing at my solo shower sex fail. \n\nI\u2019m ok! My lower back and elbow hurts a bit from how hard I hit the floor and I have a slight headache but I think I\u2019ll survive. He\u2019s taking care of me in between our hysterics. Heed my warning, guys, play safe in the shower. Don\u2019t be like me and have an orgasm which literally knocks you off your feet. \n\nTl;dr tifu by trying to be sneaky and play with myself in the shower but instead slipped and made it a bigger deal than it needed to be.",

We got off work a little later than expected and missed the galley hours so we stopped at the mini mart on base to grab some food. They have a decent selection mostly just your typical gas station food. So some guys grab cold sandwiches or microwavable burritos, I decided to go for the chef boyardee classic spaghetti and meatballs. Now you have to heat you food at the mini mart because they don't trust us with microwaves in our rooms. You'll understand why soon enough. I put my spaghetti in the microwave and set the timer.  We are just bullshiting in the mini waiting for our food when all of a sudden a loud bang what sounded like a gunshot goes off behind us and without skipping a beat there were 4 marines M16s raised yelling at everybody to get down as they make their way through the shop clearing the isles straight towards us. That's when I realized I forgot to remove the metal top from the spaghetti. I had to show them the inside of the microwave now covered in spaghetti sauce and meatballs before they finally relaxed and put their guns down. I ended cleaning the microwave and buying a second chef boyardee.\n\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR I microwaved a chef boyardee with the metal top on creating a small spaghetti bomb surrounded by a bunch of trigger happy marines Creating a really world close quarters drill.",

On a NATO deployment to Norway  in 1979, as we were wrapping up dinner,  a friend of mine threw his leftover C-rat box into the campfire and walked into the woods for a piss.  An upopened jelly tin in his trash exploded from the heat, sending white-hot grape napalm all over those of us still gathered round the fire.  One guy caught some it in the groin and had to see the corpsman; I caught a bit on my forehead that left a burn that morphed into a festering scab that stuck around for several weeks (until I scrubbed it with a stiff brush and removed what appeared to be intact grape jelly).  My friend later said that when he heard the explosion followed by a volley of swearing, he remembered his jelly tin and thought to himself, \"Well, this is not not going to be good when I go back.\"  ",

        "selftext": "so as in every post, this happened several years ago. i will try to keep the story as short as possible\n\nso me and a friend have the great tradition of breaking in a school once a year. we use to go into the school in the evening, then hide in two lockers until everyone left. then we usually have a great time by ourselves drinking and eating snacks. \nthere have been a few occasions, where really crazy stuff happened, but the wildest one is this: \nwe just came out of the lockers and wanted to start the party. as we walked down the stairs to get our booze, we saw what we thougt was a dead boby outside the building. to give some context, it was nighttime and winter, so dark and cold af. we are at that point kind of panicking. we cant call the police and tell them where we have seen the body??\nso we put a little stone between the door, so we can come in again later, bc we had all our stuff in the school. we go on the roof of the school, where you can go to even when the school is closed. luckily, the body is also visible from there, it lays like on the edge of the roof, but not a roof where you should go, like further down. \nso we call the police and tell them we saw a body. a few minutes later, the police, firemen and an ambulance arrive. they get the 'body'. its a boy, around 14 years of age. he is drunk af, cant respond to them and has a broken collarbone and is under normal temperature. \nthey take him to the hospital and begin to ask us stuff. we lie a lot bc they ask us why we are here, where we have seen him etc. they even brought a detective, who should ask us seperatly, so were in a reeally dumb situation, bc we didnt talk about an alibi. \nso we tell them that we really wanna go home, were so tired etc, and they let us go. all the police cars etc are standing right in front of the door we put a stone in between... in a brief moment, we sprint to the door and run inside again, where we drank ourselves to sleep\n\nso yeah turns out the boy was drinking with his friend. his friend fell asleep, meanwhile he fell down the roof. his friend wakes up, cant see him and decides to go home, what left the boy in the cold, asleep/ unconcious.\n\nmoral of the story: something a little illegal can save someones life!\n\nTL ; DR i broke in a school, saw a liveless body out of the window, on the roof. had to lie to the police a bit, then snuck inside the school again and drank booze\n\nedit: im a girl from switzerland for those asking",

            "It\u2019s not the most similar story, but is on point to your advice, \n\nMe and my child Hood best friend were drinking heavily, we were about 16-17 years old. We drank an entire bottle of wild turkey 101 and were also drinking 40oz malt liqueurs. He kind of just disappeared when we were walking through the woods. It was winter, but where I live there isn\u2019t always snow and there wasn\u2019t at this time. But it was cold. I assumed he wandered off and didn\u2019t really care. Looked for him a bit but didn\u2019t find him and met some other friends who were in the woods already. I passed out drunk by the fire they had. When I awoke, my friend had never showed up, I assumed he was lost in the woods. We couldn\u2019t find him and gave up and didn\u2019t care, as kids we just assumed he\u2019d be fine. He ended up being half under one of the cars where we parked, but we left him passed out in the cold for the better part 8 hours until that point. (FWIW we had checked there earlier and he wasn\u2019t there then...) If we hadn\u2019t found him we\u2019d probably have just left. He would have froze. \n\nBe safe when drinking with friends, they will just leave your ass and not think about it. Especially if they are drunk. Probably one of the greatest perils of drinking in youth.",

While they are really nice people, it\u2019s a challenge for my heathen self to successfully endure a whole weekend with them without saying something that brings shame to my name. Onward...\n\nSo earlier tonight, my girlfriend\u2019s family decided to play some games together. We settled on Drawful (a game that allows you to draw things from your phone). This is where things go south... \n\nAfter choosing our character names, you have to draw your character. Seems cool, right? However, this is my first time playing and everyone failed to mention that once you start drawing, YOU CAN\u2019T ERASE. So being the funny guy I am, I draw this huge, veiny dick and secretly show it to my girlfriend in front of me. We have a good laugh because we both knew damn well that her family would be mortified if it showed up on the screen. As a joke, my girlfriend pretends to hit \u201csubmit,\u201d on my phone. In reality, she REALLY DID HIT SUBMIT. Next thing I know, my character name pops up on the tv with a huge, contoured schlong. There was no mistaking this beauty, either. I feel my heart skip a beat. I looked around and accidentally make eye contact with her 12-year-old sister, who looks at me with a disappointment unmatched by anything I\u2019ve experience before.\n\nI panic. I try to exit out of the game, but my Dick-asso masterpiece remains in the center of the screen. I stare at my phone to avoid the look from her parents. I try to pretend that I have no idea what happened. \n\nThe game starts and every round, without fail, my pork sword drawing makes it way around the screen. I don\u2019t say a single word. The room is uncomfortably silent. I hear the occasional giggle from my girlfriend, and I\u2019m doing my best not to explode inside.\n\nThe game FINALLY ends after what feels like a year. I select the new character screen and her dad says, \u201cWhat? You don\u2019t want to keep your big penis on there? Jesus would be so proud on this Easter weekend.\u201d\n\nSafe to say my girlfriend (more her family) isn\u2019t the one for me. \n\nTL;DR: I played Jackbox\u2019s Drawful with my girlfriend\u2019s family. I joking drew a huge dick as my character and my girlfriend accidentally submitted it. So there I was on the tv, identifiable as a veiny dick in front my girlfriend\u2019s sheltered, conservative family...\n\n\nEDIT: the comment about her not being the one for me was sarcastic.

At first we thought she was injured or sick, so we took her to the vet, they told us that she is fine and just naturally talkative, and that we'll have to suffer then he said  \"now please get her out of here I can't take it anymore\" jokingly of course.  \n\n\nSo here is the fuck up, I've resorted to saying, *shut up cat!* or just *shut up!*, little did I know that me saying this so many times would cause her to now respond to this as her name. So we now have to call her by ***shut up*** in order to get her to come......... so later down the line my friend came over and I saw my cat and yelled ***shut up!***, and he then looked at me like I was a total asshole, and said, \"if I'm annoying you I can just leave\" I had to then explain why I said that and we had a pretty good laugh, now I have to figure out what to do about her name.   \n\n\nEdit: Thank you all so meowy much for the awards I really appreciate it, but please give your money to charity instead of me.

Well, I talked to my vet about it because I was concerned that she was hurting or sick, and she said she had done some research and there is actually a breed called British Tortoise Shell that is notorious for being overly vocal.  Well, my torty was also half Siamese and had that Siamese tone of voice  So I woke up to THAT every morning.  Well, I got her a buddy and he also picked up the talkative habit so I had TWO talkative cats that would greet me at the door when I got home from work and proceed to talk my ever living ears off for about an hour solid.  My male cat also liked to play fetch.  He was something.  \n\nI would be in the living room reading and my torty would be in another part of the house....I call her name and I'd hear her come running.

        "selftext": "This happened last week. I was in a hurry to get to the grocery store pharmacy to pickup a prescription about 20 minutes before work. I pulled into the parking lot, walk through the door, and I hear in an automated, LOUD, voice, \u201cTHANK YOU FOR SHOPPING AT SAFEWAY!\u201d  \nSlightly startled by the unexpected greeting, I continue to the pharmacy at the back of the store. Multiple times I hear, \u201cWELCOME TO SAFEWAY!\u201d And \u201cTHANK YOU FOR CHOOSING YOUR LOCAL SAFEWAY.\u201d And I think to myself how annoying this booming robo greeter was.  \n  \n  After I pickup my script, I grab a couple other quick items and proceed to the U-Scan to check out and I am constantly hearing this booming robo-voice. After I finish at U-Scan and turn to leave I see a manager speaking to the U-Scan clerk and decide to take the opportunity to tell her, \u201cYou guys have got to get rid of that robot greeter. That THING is SOOOOOO annoying!\u201d    \nThe manager looks at me like I\u2019m A FUCKING MONSTER and says, \u201cThere is NO WAY we are getting rid of Sarah! She isn\u2019t going ANYWHERE!\u201d       \n  \nConfused and surprised I bit my tongue and gave her a look like like she\u2019s crazy and go to leave, running the confusion through my head, looking down as I walk. Then I go to exit and hear the robo greeter thanking me for shopping, and I look up. Turns out the robo-greeter Sarah is a human woman named Sarah with ALS or some kind of similar Hawking-esque catastrophic disability. She was using a computer tablet attached to her wheelchair to select greeting messages for customers as they enter and exit.   My stomach immediately SANK and my face turned red as I walked back out to my car in shock at my own assholery...\n\nTL;DR I told the grocery store to fire their robo-greeter that was actually a severely disabled woman.   \n  \nEDIT - Just to clarify, I think this is HYSTERICAL now. I find great hilarity at my own blunder, which is why I decided to share. I\u2019m not going to a different store. I have no shame in going back there at all. \n\nVisual Aid - https://imgur.com/a/pH9hxkC",

        "selftext": "Writing this from the bathroom as I just realized what happened. \n\nHome for the holidays. My family got an Amazon Alexa a couple of years ago, and my parents never quite figured out how to actually make it work. It used to be set up under my account, but when I moved out last year I transferred everything to my mom. It\u2019s in the kitchen, and she mostly uses it for timers while cooking. \n\nOur family likes off-beat Christmas music, and I spent a while some time back curating it all on to a special Spotify playlist for us. We like to listen to it as we have brunch and open presents on Christmas morning. \n\nHere\u2019s where the FU starts. Yesterday I wanted to play a new song I heard for my mom. I couldn\u2019t get the Echo to find it, so I had to connect my phone via Bluetooth. The family all got new phones a month ago, so there were no devices automatically connected. I paired my phone and played the song. \n\nThis morning, before a long day of family, small talk, presents and whatnot, I was mentally preparing myself for the day in my childhood bed. You know, relieving some stress.... with videos. Oddly enough none of the videos I stumbled upon had sound. I wrote it off as shoddy sources and finished the deed. \n\nWhen I came downstairs to say good morning and merry Christmas to the family, my sister greets me with \u201cyou need to play the playlist from your phone, I can\u2019t get the Echo to connect to my phone.\u201d \u201cOkay, no problem, I\u2019ll connect my phone.\u201d \u201cI was trying to connect mine, and I think yours is already connected.\u201d\n\nNot sure what my family heard playing over the Echo this morning, but it wasn\u2019t my usual Christmas playlist. \n\ntl;dr paired my new phone to my family\u2019s Echo yesterday. Went to tug one out this morning in my childhood bed, and I\u2019m pretty sure that soundtrack blasted in the kitchen for my family. ",

I decided to... relieve myself with some videos and all was well. All of a sudden, my audio cuts out and I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s just a quiet video. So I crank up the volume and still nothing. After a couple minutes of trying to figure this out, I noticed there were lights on in the driveway coming through my window. It was my dad AND MY PHONE CONNECTED TO HIS BLUETOOTH. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that when my phone is connected to his car it says \u201c[kitttxn]\u2019s iPhone\u201d on it. Frickk.

I asked what she meant and she said she was watching Netflix when suddenly the headphones switched to some crappy Justin Bieber song, then switched to loud, sexual moaning and grunting. I told her maybe somehow it connected to the neighbor's tablet or tv, since the houses are so close together (Yes, I know that's not how Bluetooth works, at all) And then I said I had to go get something from my room, and went to tell my husband he needed to turn of Bluetooth, and why.

        "selftext": "This happened yesterday but I didn't really know how to explain it until know.\n\nIt was my university's homecoming this weekend, so everybody was getting super drunk and just having a good time. During the day, my one housemate told me she was gonna be bringing someone home that night which I was totally fine with.\n\nBy the time she brought him over, I was in my bed trying to fall asleep. Her room is right beside mine so I was already thinking that I would be able to hear them, but I just figured they would try to be quiet. Once they got to her room, I could hear the bed creaking a couple minutes after. Me being tired and wanting to drown out the noise, I decided \"I'll just put on my Bluetooth headphones so I can't hear them.\" Now usually my phone auto-connects to my headphones, but this time was different. I saw that my phone had connected to something, but didn't bother checking that it was my headphones.\n\nI opened Instagram for a nice nightly browse, only to find out that the first video on my timeline wasn't playing audio. I thought my phone volume was low so I turned it all the way up. I was genuinely confused but began to hear a faint noise through the wall. By the time I realized my headphones weren't playing audio, it was too late; the Monsters Inc. theme started playing extremely loud from the other room. I promptly disconnected my phone and I hear a bang on my wall following a scream of \"LEGOGH\\_, IS THAT YOU FUCKING WITH MY SPEAKER?!?\" I was speechless, I didn't say anything because I couldn't believe what had just happened.\n\nIt turns out that earlier in the day, I had connected to her speaker to play music and that's what my phone auto-connected too. After the guy left her room, I tried to explain to her what happened but she is convinced that I intentionally did it. They didn't even finish having sex because I killed the mood, and now she's extremely pissed off at me.\n\nTLDR; accidentally connected to my housemates Bluetooth speaker while she was having sex and I watched a meme with the monsters inc. theme in it\n\nEDIT: she isn't mad anymore, my other housemates brought it up last night and we all had a good laugh\n\nEDIT2: Broke it into paragraphs for an easier read\n\nEDIT3: Also to clarify, it was [the earrape version](https://youtu.be/IRP-2y43BLo) of the theme song",

        "selftext": "There's not really much back story apart from the fact that my daughter was a breach baby and wouldn't turn. Due to various complications, we had opted for a planned C-section. The whole thing in general was just really bizarre, like, you pick your kid's birthday just like that! Anyway, my wife and I tend to be goofy, fun loving folk that's always up for a laugh. We do a lot of silly things together to make each other laugh, though as with most men, I tend to meander into the dumber territory more often as you will soon hear;\n\nOn the day of the birth, just as we were about to leave to the hospital, I picked up this fishbowl style lamp shade (looked something like [this](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/images/products/jakobsbyn-pendant-lamp-shade-clear-glass__0683771_PE720859_S5.JPG?f=s)) we hadn't yet put up onto my head because \"we're boldly going where neither of us have gone before\". I just saw it on my way to the door and didn't really think it through, so I immediately regretted this decision when my giant ears, my nose and hair (got down to my ass length hair that was in a loose bun) ended up blocking my head in this thing and I couldn't get it off. We tried for a bit, and my wife was understandably over it pretty quick because we were going to be late for our baby appointment, so I made the executive decision to not make the situation any more stressful than it should've been (too late) and to just drive to the hospital with this on my head and hope that someone at the hospital might have some idea what I should do.\n\nAs you can imagine, the car ride was a real mix bag of emotions for us all.\n\nWe arrive, I do the walk of shame into the maternity ward with this bubble on my head holding my wife's hand and there's this older nurse who greeted us and I could see her dinner plate eyes just screaming \"what the fuck...\"and my wife jokingly said \"....Yep! I'm having *his* baby!\" to which literally all the midwives in the maternity ward that could see us walk up the corridor just start howling with laughter and whoever was not visible poked their heads round the corner to see this fucking spectacle. My wife was then ushered into a room where they monitored the baby and her. A nurse (who was this massive, buff tattooed dude, by the way, so imagine that) took me to another one of those inspection rooms and got the thing off with some sort of lube/gel.\n\nAnyway, 4 hours later, we had a healthy baby and I got hazed by some of the older midwives. It was really good fun in the end. Wouldn't recommend, but it definitely beats any other birth story I've heard AND broke the ice with most of the staff.\n\n**TL;DR: I got a bowl shaped lamp shade stuck on my head and had to take my wife to the hospital to have our baby whilst I had the bowl removed.**\n\nP.S. For those of you wondering how I got it on in the first place, here's some handy dandy instructions in case you want to give it a go; get the bun in first, then move downwards over the ears, the nose and then push down until the ears get into the rim. The bun will smoosh up inside and move downwards a bit and voila! You're a jackass!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Eish. Glad you guys found this so amusing. I don't know what these awards do, but I've never gotten one on my main before, so thanks for handing them to me. Also, thanks for all being so swell. I honestly was expecting people to just call me an idiot, but I've gotten some really lovely messages from some of you.",

Your giant head!!!!\" \n\nLuckily I'm pretty good at getting things un-stuck. I Winnie-the-Pooh'd him on out of there and escorted him to the car before they made us buy the bowl. \n\nI had his baby too. She's perfect but she totally inherited his giant head. Needless to say, her first pet probably won't be a goldfish. \n\n\n\n**TLDR; my husband did this too. I also had his baby, but luckily not the same day.**",

If it's a steel one, they just cut it off no big deal. However every once in a while someone comes in with a titanium cock ring stuck on and they don't have the tools to cut that off so they have to call the fire department. When the fire department comes, it's not just one guy, it's like minimum 3 firemen for some reason, plus the doctor has to be there and a nurse and some other people as well, so there ends up needing to be like 10 people in the room while they cut some poor guy's cock ring off.",

He lives with his brother in an apartment, and his mother comes occasionally to spend time with them. \n\nWe decided to indulge in a little herb smoking one Saturday night. The munchies kicked in around 2AM so we made some potato wedges in the air fryer. Came back and spooned to sleep. \n\nI wake up the next morning, with his morning wood pressed to my butt. This, for some reason turned me on and we proceeded to have lazy spooning sex at 6:30AM.  \n\nMidway through it, we heard his apartment's main door open. Tinder dude stopped and got up, confused. I was still lying on the bed, wearing his t-shirt and boxers, which were pulled down to my knees. Ass visible, in all it's glory. \n\nNow I was still under the impression that his room's door was locked. I was wrong. His mother opened the door and I swear she had the same expression as the shocked Pikachu meme. :o\n\nShe immediately closed the door. I ran to the washroom and got dressed, and hid inside for a good 20 minutes trying to figure out if jumping from the washroom window would be a good escape plan or not. \n\nTurns out she came early to take the dog (who was in the same room as us the entire time) for her vet appointment. \n\nI left as soon as she left.\n\nShe later had a conversation with her 22 year old son about consent, and respecting women. She asked him if I was his girlfriend, to which he had to explain his very catholic mother that \"we're just two friends trying to figure things out\". \n\nSpoiler: we ended up dating. Thankfully his mother joked it off the next time we met saying \"hi, I'm *****, Tinder guy's mom. I didn't get a chance to introduce myself the last time we met.\" (Chuckles). \n\nTl;dr: Tinder date and I got too baked and forgot to lock the room. Woke up the next morning to pip pip the diddly doo and got walked in on by the dude's mum. And that's the story of how my now SO's mom saw my bare ass before she could see my face first.\n\nPS:  we never ate the wedges and he found them lying in the air fryer a week later. \n\nEdit: thanks for the gold, kind stranger!\n\nEdit 2: holy shit I can't believe this blew up. My account is juuuusssttt 4 days old. Man I love Reddit. \n\nEdit 3: This one's more like a clarification. I live in a non first world country where it's fairly common for people to live with their parents/for parents to come over. His mom was supposed to pick the dog up to take her to the vet, and was being nice by not wanting to wake her son up. She had the house keys, which is again, fairly normal here. WE were dumbasses. \n\nCalm yer titties Reddit. ",

            "This semi-reminds me of a first date I had. \n\nMet this girl on tinder and we hit it off really well while talking on the phone so we agree to go on a date. Our plan was to go out drinking for a while then head back to her place and have sex. We meet up and grab a bottle of alcohol then head down to a bench by the ocean to have a few shots before we hit the bar/club for more drinks. By 1am we're both pretty drunk, so we head to a Korean BBQ place to grab some food. \n\nMy date ordered us this Korean alcoholic drink that comes in a 750ml bottle and tastes like grape pop. Being the dumbass that I am, I drink 2 of these over 45 minutes, thinking they're the same alcohol % as beer. But rather than being ~5% alcohol, it was 15-20%. Suffice to say I was definitely over my limit and my memory of what happened that night stops about 30 minutes after we left the restaurant. \n\nI wake up the next morning in my dates bed, hungover as fuck, with my date nowhere to be found. Now what I didn't mention is that my dates parents are super rich and have a large mansion, and my date lives at home in her own little corner of the house. Upon waking up and being unable to see my date in her bedroom, I leave the room and am greeted by a large rec room that has an attached kitchen and a bathroom right beside the bedroom door. I pop into the bathroom and relieve my bladder then crawl back into bed and shoot my date a text asking where she is, then promptly fall back asleep. \n\nI wake up an hour or so later and my date had texted me that she tried to wake me for an hour to go grab breakfast with her friends, but I wouldn't wake up so she left by herself (later she told me she didn't realize just how drunk/blackout I was). She also said her parents won't come downstairs, but try not to get caught and sneak out when I can, or I can wait for her to get back and we can go do something. I decide to wait an hour or two to feel less hungover before I slip out.\n\nI get up again later to go to the bathroom and grab some water, but this time when I leave her room, her dad is in the rec room kitchen, fixing the sink. I really need to pee and his back is turned, so I slipped into the bathroom and sat down on the toilet so it would sound more like a woman peeing. When I'm done, I peek my head out the door to make sure he's not looking, then make a quick dash back for my dates bedroom and lock the door.\n\nI text my date back about the dad situation and she says to just wait it out then slip out the back when I get a chance. I decide to wait it out by falling back asleep. \n\nA while late I'm awoken by a knock on the door and her dads voice calling her name. Being in the deep, hungover sleep that I am, the initial knock rouses me and I let out an \"MMMMmmMmMmmm\" noise. This obviously startles the dad a bit, so he starts knocking and calling out her name more vigorously. Meanwhile I'm shitting my pants hoping that he doesn't have a master key, so I close my eyes to pretend I'm asleep just in case he does. \n\nHe did have a master key. \n\nDad comes in and says \"Where's *insert daughters name*?\". I pretend to open my eyes for the first time that day, take a look around and reply \"she's not here?\". Dad really isn't happy with the strange half-naked boy in his missing daughters bed situation, so he asks me where I last saw her/where we were last night, then tells me I need to get out of the house ASAP. As I'm leaving, he's pulling out of the driveway so he can locate and pick up his daughter. \n\nAnd that, ladies and gentleman, is the story of how I met my girlfriends dad for the first time. \n\nWe've been going out for a few months now, and over Christmas my girlfriends mom told the story to her entire extended family over dinner about how her dad first met me and how he liked me from the moment we talked. Definitely not the vibes I initially got, but they've told her they think I'm the best guy she's ever dated, so who am I to argue with that.",

I was a late bloomer and had only been with one girl before that. We had a great time and had tons of fun. We understood each other perfectly.\n\nOne day I invited her over and things got pretty hot real quick. I was going down on her and then it happened. I came in my underwear. I was so ashamed and my reaction was to try to hide it. I said i had to go to the bathroom to get the condom (which was true). I cleaned myself up and rushed back.\n\nNow, it takes a while for me to reload. I am like a musket, not a machine gun. So she said now its her turn to please me. My little guy did not react. A combination of nature and shame made it impossible for me to get hard.\n\nTrying to play it cool I told her I was somehow not in the mood and we should just chill for a bit. She said ok but the night was ruined.\n\nAfter that contact dwindled and she ended up moving.\n\nAlmost 13 years later we ran into each other! It was awesome. This girl is great! We are now over 30 and doing very well in life. We hit it off right away and went for a drink.\n\nWe started joking about the past and we started talking about that night. She then tells me she really liked me and wanted a relationship with me! She was just so ashamed that she couldnt get me hard and thats why she didn't contact me anymore! Fml. I started laughing and told her the truth, i jizzed my pants while going down on her. After that we couldn't stop laughing.\n\nUnlucky for me, she has a boyfriend and was moving to his country in the next days.\n\nSo bois, if you jizz your pants, be honest about it! Girls might be flattered!\n\nTldr; jizzed my pants while going down on a girl i really liked. Tried to hide it from her. Couldn't get hard for sex.

Trust me, it's not nearly as embarrassing as movies and popular media make it out to be and they'll likely be flattered because they'll think you found them so hot that you prematurely busted.

        "selftext": "The wound is still fresh so bear with me. \n\n**The Discovery**\n\nI had a rough day and my fianc\u00e9's algorithms are top notch, so I was scrolling through his apps to entertain myself hoping for a pick me up. He went to take a shower. I opened his Instagram (got bored with Reddit, so sorry) and noticed he had a couple new dms. We don't snoop through each other's phones, but we don't hide anything either (or so I thought) so I clicked on them just to see if they were important because he doesn't check Insta that often. \n\nWELL. I see the dms are from a deleted account???, thus sparking my interest. So I click, and I scroll. Messages go *years* back--maybe twenty to thirty messages total. Some winky faces, some slightly sexual memes, and a few photos of lingerie. Nothing outright incriminating but... *who is this bitch*? My heart dropped. We're getting married in less than five months. These messages aren't okay. He's not a cheater??? Never once have I questioned that, nor has he given me any reason to. I start to see red.\n\n**The Confrontation**\n\nI put on my big girl pants, wipe my tears, and storm into the bathroom. Rip open the shower curtain, revealing this idiot's (albeit glorious) naked body. He, though quite startled, raises his eyebrows and smirks. \"Looking to join?\" He says. Wrong move buddy. \n\nI go off. You know, like a badass.\n\nHe denies it. You know, like a liar. \n\nI hold his towel hostage and toss him his phone so he can see for himself. He scrolls and pulls off this wildly confused demeanor. I literally see the blood leave his face. He just kinda says stuttering \"...baby I don't know?\" \n\nWe go back and forth. He swears up and down he has no idea who this could be. \"I'm just as surprised as you are!!!\" He claims, criminally. So, I take his phone so I can quote this \"other woman\" for emphasis.\n\n**The Reveal**\n\nI ready my best valley girl voice and scroll to the most recent received messages. I notice for the first time, inconveniently so, a picture *she* sent of a Guinea pig. I think, \"Aw hell, I love Guinea pigs.\" Then I remember... *I have seen this Guinea pig before*.\n\nThen I realize. *She* is me. \n\nI deleted all my social media almost a year ago. Neither of us remembered any of the messages we sent. I start laughing and happy crying. My fianc\u00e9 looks as if he just won the lottery and received the death penalty simultaneously.\n\n**The Aftermath**\n\nNow we sit, *both* recently showered, debating whether or not we should welcome a Guinea pig into our family. I am so embarrassed. He is so relieved. We are crazy, stupid, and so in love.\n\nTLDR; Found cheating-indicating messages on my fianc\u00e9's phone. Turns out it was my old deleted account. I'm an idiot. He's a keeper.\n\nEdit: Didn\u2019t wanna edit because I didn\u2019t wanna make the hate worse. My fianc\u00e9 commented somewhere in here a few minutes ago, I just picked up my phone & WOW was not expecting all this. I did apologize to him fully, and I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t know I should\u2019ve included that. Most posts I read on here don\u2019t usually include a full resolution. I wrote this quickly not expecting it to blow up. Looking back I would\u2019ve changed a lot of my wording. I could defend myself for a lot of things but that likely wouldn\u2019t help. All of this story is true, it was so odd which is what prompted me to post it. He\u2019s not leaving me, there\u2019s so much more to our lives than this. I didn\u2019t assault him. We are naked at home more than we\u2019re clothed. You\u2019re all not in my relationship, but I can tell you that him being in the shower was not a violating aspect. He was annoyed, but not hurt or degraded. I\u2019ve never blown up like this & intend never to again. I\u2019ve also never worried or accused him before of cheating. This was my first experience and I didn\u2019t know how to handle it. I understand concern for him but there\u2019s no reason to say I deserve xyz. Not sure how to prove this story is true? But think what you will. I didn\u2019t mean to sound so cavalier; I wasn\u2019t very conscious of my tone of voice. I always write dramatically but understand that if you don\u2019t know me it\u2019s different. Wasn\u2019t expecting to be called psychotic. Lastly thanks to the few commenters who left Guinea pig info.\n\nFinal edit only for clarity bc it got worse after my first: His comment said this but it\u2019s lost. He handed me his phone. He goes on Instagram maybe once or twice a year? We have an open phone policy. I didn\u2019t snoop because our boundaries are: I don\u2019t look at texts with his mom, brother, or therapist. He doesn\u2019t look at my texts with my sister, brother, therapist, or best friend. I don\u2019t have social media besides Reddit & he\u2019s rarely active on his. To my knowledge, the boundaries we set have never been broken by either of us. \nThe lingerie pics weren\u2019t of me. They were pics he sent to me that he thought I\u2019d like. \nI wrote this using the exact language of my thoughts in the moment. Sorry if it\u2019s cringy but it\u2019s accurate for what I was feeling/thinking. I\u2019m not a creative writer & I\u2019m not trying to be. \n\nAnd disclaimer: if you keep stigmatizing mental illness like you are I\u2019m going to delete this if I can. I\u2019m not here for karma I\u2019m here cause today I fucked up. It\u2019s absolutely horrible to use illnesses to describe behavior in such hateful ways, please think about the people you could hurt, besides me, who might read your hate & feel shame because of it.",

I went to go pay a ticket (expired tags) at my scheduled time and saw \u201cNO SHORTS, FLIP FLOPS, HATS, UNTUCKED SHIRTS...\u201d in bold letters on the door. Fortunately for me, the front desk had extra slacks on hand for this very thing. Unfortunately for me, the slacks were a size 32, and I haven\u2019t been a size 32 since high school... I\u2019m a big guy who\u2019s been \u201cblessed\u201d with thick thighs (heard they\u2019re in style). These slacks were so tight, I couldn\u2019t zip them past the first rung. All I could do was throw my belt on, cinch it tight, and throw my shirt over it all to hide the undesirables. These things looked like yoga pants on me.\n\nI\u2019d guess about 30 people were in the court room, spread out amongst the benches. I was capable of slipping behind everyone without them seeing and sitting on the back bench. One lady enters right before go time and asks me to scoot back so she could get by. I said \u201cMa\u2019am, if I bend my legs I\u2019ll bust these pants wide open.\u201d She looks down, sees my pants and starts snickering, then steps over me. \n\nAfter the judge said his speech, he began to call people 1 by 1 as they said their plea. He allowed us to stand where we were and shout our plea towards him (WIN). Everyone before me requested a conference. I was fourth to be called. \n\nJudge: \u201cQTVain how do you plea?\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cGuilty, sir. I would just like to pay my ticket.\u201d\n\nJudge: \u201cAlright, that\u2019s 100 dollars, please step up to the front, sign this document and the officer will escort you to the cashier.\u201d\n\nMe: *panicking* \u201cUh yes, sir\u201d\n\nAs I\u2019m waddling up to the front, it really dawned on me that I looked like a bum off a three day bender. Flip flops (that were clearly not allowed), the tightest pants you\u2019ve ever seen on a man, and an untucked t-shirt. I\u2019m starting to hear people fighting back laughter as I walk by every damn bench.\n\nJudge: \u201cDidn\u2019t meet the dress code huh?\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cSir, these people behind me know more about my body than I do right now. I\u2019d really like to pay my ticket and go.\u201d\n\nJudge: \u201cHa, fair enough. Get outta here.\u201d\n\nI waddled out of there as quickly as I could and threw my shorts on in the bathroom. Told my wife what happened when I got home. \u201cYah I thought it was weird you went into court with shorts, I was going to tell you but forgot.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks babe.\u201d\n\n\nTL;DR Check your local courts dress code before attending. I didn\u2019t, and wore the wrong attire. \n\nEdit: Hey y\u2019all, I get it. I should have thought about it. I\u2019m just your standard law-abiding citizen who has never experienced the inside of a courtroom before. Can we not be so hostile? I was just trying to show the judge a little leg.\n\nEdit 2: I\u2019m trying to respond to all of y\u2019all asking me questions. To further clarify, I thought I had to show up to the courthouse to pay the ticket, I didn\u2019t actually believe I had to see the judge. I was headed to work after the visit, and my job has a really, really lax dress code. Hope this helps, my fingers are getting tired.\n\nEdit 3: Thank y\u2019all for the gold! I\u2019ve honestly enjoyed chatting with so many of you. Reddit, you\u2019re beautiful (even the random little shit stains that comment). I tried to respond to as many of you as I could.

            "One time I got a summons for jury duty on my birthday. I decided that if I had to go to jury duty on my birthday, I was going to have some fun with it. So I dressed up in full Scottish regalia, kilt, hose, vest and tie, the whole thing. They only thing I didn't have was the fly plaid and sgian dubh, since A. I didn't have one, and B. No knives in court.\n\nSo I show up and sit in the bench with a book, some people giving me weird looks, but I didn't care, just waiting for everything to start. The judge eventually comes in and starts talking with other court employees while I'm reading. I'm distracted from my book reading however when the bailiff comes over to me and says,\n\n\"The judge would like for you to approach the bench.\"\n\nI dog ear my page and squeeze out of the pew and head up to the judge. He's smiling and asks me essentially why I'm dressed the way I am. I tell him that this is formal Scottish attire, today is my birthday, and this is how I dress on my birthday (which isn't a lie, I do dress up on my birthday, but usually only for dinner). We then spend the next 15 minutes or so talking about history. He compliments my outfit, tells me that he's Polish, and explains that he feels a kinship to the Scottish, since both the Scots and the Poles were cultures that were nearly destroyed by outsiders. When were done he then asks me to stand there while he addressed the court. He then told everybody there that it was my birthday, told them about my outfit, and asked that anyone who would like to do so wish me a happy birthday, which several of them did later.\n\nHe was very nice, and dismissed us all shortly afterward since his docket had been cleared before we had arrived that morning (except one, who elected to have a trial by judge, so none of us were needed). He then told the court that before we left, he would like for us to line up so he could personally thank all of us for coming, since jury duty is an important part of the legal system. I waited around and got a picture with him afterwards. All in all, it was a pretty good day.\n\nEdit: Holy shit! My first gold dubloon! Thank you kind stranger for the gold, and all the positive reactions to my story!",

I\u2019d assume it was akin to going to the DMV or the post office to apply for your passport or whatever. Just show up and get it over with. \n\n\nClearly I\u2019m a savage as well for not assuming you have to dress like it\u2019s an interview. But hell, I\u2019m a builder/engineer. The last time I wore nice clothes to an interview was years ago. I have like one formal outfit tucked away in storage somewhere, because the vast majority of the time I only wear stuff I can move around in. Some people just lead lives where it\u2019s not expected of them to dress up all the time, and they can still be highly respected and get paid good money without ever having to even put on a pair of slacks.

I've gone to criminal court before and the only rule is no tank tops, short shorts or flip flops. If you're going for a criminal matter it really helps to dress in a suit or dress. But I've seen so many people in pajamas as well as some really strange sweatsuits and other bizarre outfits.

I usually get them near my nose or on my neck, but this time I got one right next to my ear. \n\nUnlike previous ones, this one was not only extremely painful, it was also ridiculously big, I couldn't stand to see it when I looked in the mirror. It had been over a week and it showed no signs of coming to the surface, and it was giving me bad headaches and earaches so I decided to try and pop it under the skin. \n\nIt took about an hour of unbearably painful squeezing but I finally heard a little *squish* and had instant pain relief. It was still quite sore but it no longer felt like it was going to erupt out of my face. \n\nFast forward 2 days later, I was riding my bike about 25km/h on the hill past my house when all of a sudden I just fell off the bike and slid down the road on my side (leaving a considerable amount of my skin behind) \n\nI had no idea why I had fallen as I wasn't turning, or doing anything unusual. I hobbled home and put some antiseptic on my road rash and slept all afternoon. The next day I went to the doctor to get the road rash treated and dressed properly, while I was there he asked something that prompted me to tell him about my \"ear pimple\" situation. \n\nHe checked my ear and told me that I had in fact not popped a pimple, but my preauricular lymph node, causing an infection in my ear which is why I had lost balance on my bike. \n\nI was off my bike for about a week before I started riding again (and then I stacked it and tore my MCL, but that's another story) \n\nTL;DR: I thought I was popping a painful pimple, but actually popped my preauricular lymph node causing an ear infection which then resulted in me badly stacking my bike",

So I decided to help. \n\nThere I am barreling down this big ass looking observatory dome looking mother fucker in between in her legs. I ask her if she's ready. She said she was. She wasn't. So I popped the thing and it shot out onto my glasses and whatever didn't hit me went over my shoulder onto the floor. This pain caused her to close her legs faster than a bear trap giving me a near concussion.\n\nSo the whole experience ended with me laying in puss watching the world spin.

            "I think those large, under-skin pimples are referred to as \"cysts\". I know because I am also cursed with them.\n\nI'd say as a general rule, only pop pimples that you can squeeze out of the surface. A pimple is an infection, and your body is trying to contain it. By popping it *inside* your skin, you're only letting the infection do more damage.\n\nAlso before squeezing like crazy, I recommend gently scraping pimples open with a clean fingernail or a rough acne pad. If you create that exit hole first, and then squeeze, you reduce the chance of it squeezing deeper into your skin, and it is a lot less painful.",

This paired with my terrible hearing is a diabolical combination. Since I can remember, whenever he sees me he always has said \u201cHey! Wanna color?\u201d in a really fast manner. Which young me always politely declined. Throughout the years this has continued. I always said no thank you because I have shaky hands and my coloring skills are subpar. Plus, maybe he loves coloring I mean hey, if that\u2019s his thing then so be it even though I\u2019ve never once seen him color.\n\nThen last week it dawned on me. He approached me and said  **\u201cHey! Wanna color?\u201d**  At least that\u2019s what I registered at first but then I deciphered it correctly. He was actually saying  **\u201cHey There Young feller\u201d**  .. I  Instantly became red in the face in embarrassment. For my entire life I have been responding to my grandpas greeting with No Thank you.. I explained the fuck up to him and we both had a good laugh but man I\u2019m never going to live this down.\n\nEDIT: To clear things up people keep asking how would I confuse the two phrases? He talks very quickly, quietly, and has a unique accent. So the two together sound somewhat similar. For those saying this is made up I guess believe what you want? I'm not sure why I'd make up such a strange story.\n\nThanks for the Silver!!\n\n\nTl;DR; Grandpa has always said \u201cHey wanna color?\u201d which I always responded with no thank you.

She uses a flip phone for reasons that are too long to get into, so she will occasionally use my phone when she needs to check her email or download music. \n\nBack to my dumbass. Im not going to lie yall, I trashed my brain as a teenager. I have issues with memory, short and long. But today I woke up and was chilling for a bit while my girl was at work. Suddenly I thought \"Oh shit whats my gf's birthday\". \n\nI knew what month it was in, but I couldn't remember if it was the 8th or 9th. Thats okay, I thought, ill go dig around a bit. Surely theres some paper work around the house that has her birthday on it. Spoiler: there wasn't. \n\nIm definitely not asking her friends or family as they'll surely tell her I forgot. So I do what any reasonable guy does, and I Google background check services. Enter her name and city, and for $7.99 I receive an email with every traffic ticket, address, and phone number she's ever had. Most importantly though, her birthday. \n\nI write her birthday down in a safe spot and then go back to chilling. All is well. I'm not a piece of shit boyfriend, what a relief. She gets home, our day is going well, when she asks to use my phone to read her email. I completely obliviously give it to her. She opens it, and immediately she sees a full background check on herself. \n\nI knew exactly what happened once her face changed. She immediately asked why I was back ground checking her, a year into our relationship, and then started getting emotional, asking if I didn't trust her etc.. \n\nThis is the first relationship I've ever not had trust issues in, so I immediately confess that I am a dumbass, I forgot her birthday, and I paid $7.99 to get it, because her sister and friends would snitch on me. Lol. \n\nLuckily this isn't the first time I've came off as a total moron to her, so she believed me, but she is indeed also a bit upset I forgot her birthday. Next time something like this happens I'm just admitting guilt I think. I'm also sitting here and just realized I could've waited till she was asleep and checked her license.... \n\nTL;DR I forgot my gf's bday, background checked her to find it out, then accidentally showed it to her on my phone, causing her to think I don't trust her.",

Crossed out my stupidity.  TIFU by commenting on TIFU.  :)   Of course, the people who've replied to this are correct.  Yes, the date of birth is still listed in plain text, so it's still a good way to find out someone's birth date.  The thing they actually changed with our license numbers was that they used to be of the format \"(first five letters of last name)(first letter of first name)(first letter of middle name)(three digits)(two letters)\".  This was kind of amusing to me, because my first initial happens to match the 6th letter in my last name, and my middle initial matches the 7th letter in my last name, and the last name is exactly 7 letters.  So my license number used to essentially be (my full last name) followed by the three digits and two letters, which made it easy to remember.\n\nNot sure why I confused that with the birthday thing.

            "When I was in college I played around with LSD for a little while. One weekend there was an absolutely killer storm system rolling across our state. Tropical Storm Force winds on the lake. \n\nI wanted to experience it. \n\nSo I headed up to my parent's lake house, took half a tab, and settled in for the ride. \n\nAt some point in the night, Dad's boat broke loose from the dock. I remember watching it silhouetted by lightning strikes, and noticing that it had started drifting. I tore out of the house, ran down the dock, dove in, and started swimming out after the boat. I climbed up the stern, fired it up, and started easing it back toward the dock and then realized I had no idea how I was going to manage to tie it up.\n\nThen out of nowhere, on the dock, is my father. He'd driven up to make sure I was ok. Which I... decidedly was not. I was high enough that I'd jumped into the lake to chase down a boat in the middle of a storm.\n\nTo this day I don't think he believes I didn't take it out for a joy ride.",

There was an incident decades ago where I took mushrooms and had to drive somewhere a few hours afterwards, (long story, and looking back I should have said \"no\", don't trip and drive kids you might not be as lucky as I was) but more recently, I took a 25mg edible with my better half, and maybe an hour later she comes and gets me because the washing machine is dumping water in the floor. I had to figure out how to get it to stop, how to clean the water up, and how to drain the washer, all while struggling to convince myself that the floor wasn't actually moving and that I did indeed still have legs. \n\nHowever, once I had the mess cleaned up, I decided to take the washer apart to fix it, and while the more reasonable among you reading this may be horrified at the idea, due to my particular mental deficiencies I find myself in possession of godlike mechanical abilities when I'm stoned off my ass, and some old whirlpool direct drive washer to me is like a duplo set for kindergarten children when I'm in that condition.",

I\u2019m so stupid. \n\nBefore heading to bed, I checked my email once more to look over the flight details and that\u2019s when I noticed two updates, telling me my flight has landed.

I didn\u2019t realize how much I wanted it/needed it until universal karma and my own carelessness took that away. I just cried myself to sleep. \n\nAll of that to say that while I really appreciate everyone\u2019s kindness and so much compassion, this mistake is none other than my own. If you STILL want to help, knowing about my initial shitty attitude, then I\u2019ll gladly accept, but your goodwill may be better off with someone who deserves/needs it more. \n\nAgain, thank you all for being so supportive and kind.\n\nUPDATE: I\u2019m going home! Thank you everyone for your kindness and love and support. I can\u2019t tell express to you all what this means. \n\nI got help on the condition that I pay it forward through kind acts, and I absolutely will. Thank you all for showing me how much love and kindness there is to share. \n\nThank you so much TheGrayBeard!\n\nUPDATE 2: I\u2019m home! I\u2019m currently sitting in the back of the car as my family drives me home, sipping on a cup of tea my mom made and brought for me in a thermos. \n\nI just wanted to say thank you again for everyone who extended their love and support to a complete stranger. The positivity was overwhelming, and I will pass the kindness forward every chance I get. \n\nTo those who reached out to lend an ear for my mental health, and who thanked me for being open about it, I\u2019m so amazed and grateful for the love in the community of people who struggle themselves and those who want to help. \n\nI\u2019ll try to post a family pic (probably with the faces covered for privacy) when I get a chance. \n\nFinally, thank you again, TheGrayBeard. You are an incredible person who started an entire chain of goodwill.",

If you call the reservations department with the ticket number, they might be able to change your flight for a change fee and fare difference. it sometimes takes talking to the ticketing department for this. if the airline uses SABRE as the ticketing system it's probably the same, I don't know too much about APOLLO",

It's too much work..\n\nBut I found \"Google calendar\" really helps. Especially if you use Android and you can put some widget on your phone screen that gives you an overview of your schedule and prompts you reminder on what's going to happen in next two hours. It helps me to manage my appointments a lot better, most airline emails automatically create an appointment for you on Google calendar too so it's easy to manage these stuff.\n\nMaybe try to email the airline and see if they can do anything for you? I know technically they can't but sometimes people are nice and are willing to take an extra step to get you a flight home cheaply. It never hurts to try.",

            "Sorry to hear that. Something similar happened to me this past March. I was to leave on the 22nd and come back the next month on the 23rd. I misread the flights and thought I'd leave the 23rd of March and come back the 22nd of April. I got a notification from Jetblue saying my flight had arrived and it was on time (it was very Early in the morning so I was literally in bed at the time) I put on my sandles, grabbed the Luggage I had already made and woke up my Brother to take me so he could take the car back to our house and made it to the Airport in 15 minutes. A Baggage Handler told me by the time I would make it to the train and gate the Plane would close its doors. Fortunately, there was another plane making it to the same destination later that day with some empty seats so they changed my flight free of charge.

We\u2019re sitting I Brooklyn waiting for takeout to show up.\n\nI fucking panic inside while trying to maintain a calm exterior as I lived in a very small apartment. She had even said to me the day before \u201cI cannot tell you how unbelievably sad I\u2019d be if we missed the show. It would ruin the trip\u201d\n\nI stealthily searched for and purchased new tickets for the next day. THANK SCIENCE there were some still available. The seats I had before were fairly expensive (for me) and so were the replacement seats. It was painful, but my mom was none the wiser and ended up having a great birthday.\n\nThe moral of the story, please don\u2019t feel bad. We humans all do dumb shit like this all the time.",

        "selftext": "This didn't happen today, but years ago. I worked at an insurance agency.  It was a small office with a receptionist and a few insurance producers.  We were a tight knit group and would frequently joke around with no subjects being off limits. Not your typical professional environment.\n\nOne of the producers, we'll call her Lisa, had a boyfriend named Dick.  Lisa was a recent divorcee and her relationship with Dick was very on again off again.  At the time this happened, they were fighting and not really speaking.\n\nAround the holidays we did an office grab bag thing.  I picked Lisa's name out of the hat.  I decided that since she and Dick weren't\u200b in a good spot and that she complained about how horny she was all the time, I'd get her a vibrator as her gift.  This thing was thick, about 8\", black, and had a gold tip.  \n\nSo we do the grab bag and everyone has a good laugh that Lisa got a vibrator.  We're chasing each other around the office with it and having a grand old time.  As things die down, it got put on the boss's desk.\n\nPicture the things on a regular office desk...computer, stapler, some files, pens, phone etc... and a big black and gold vibrator.  A woman comes in to buy a homeowners policy and says: I have an appointment with Boss.  Boss had no idea the vibrator was on his desk until he and the woman went into his office and sat down.\n\nThe rest of us in the office immediately realize what was happening and we lost it.  There is 0% chance the woman didn't see it.  Somehow, Boss was able to stoically make it through the sale unscathed.  Neither he or the customer acknowledged the giant gold tipped dong.  More so, this was the woman's first house and sales like that usually take a little longer as additional documents are needed for the closing and we would usually take extra time to explain the policy as insurance can be confusing to first time buyers.\n\nThe lady leaves and Boss comes out red as a tomato.  He's not even pissed because he realizes how funny the situation is...and he still made the sale.  \n\nI've always wondered if that woman ever tells the story about buying a homeowners policy with a vibrator on the desk. \n\nSounds like the story is over.... not quite.  Lisa put the vibrator in her glove box.  A few days later her 8 year old son was rummaging around in her car, found it, turned it on and walked into her house rubbing it on his face saying: look Mom, I'm shaving!\n\nI think it might have gotten thrown in the garbage after that.\n\nTl;Dr: put vibrator on boss's desk, he didn't know and conducted business with customer. Then a 8 year old boy thought it was an electric razor and rubbed it all over his face.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the gold kind stranger(s)!\n Matches the vibrator lol.",

Tonight, after a very stressful day of exams and studying for my ancient literature class, I decided to casually scroll tinder. It had been a while and I just needed to destress. Little did I know, this would cause me more stress than I could have possibly imagined. I swiped right on a girl who was less than a mile away. She was 25, a little older than me but she was super hot and she seemed into me, so I went with it. She invited me over to her apartment, and she said that she had to go in 20 minutes so make it fast. Needless to say, we got straight to business, but about three minutes after we began, we heard the front door open. She told me to stop, so I stopped and we listened. The footsteps came in our direction and I got pretty scared. I expected it would be like when my parents caught me a few years ago with my ex, and it would be embarrassment all around.  Not at all. The ancient literature professor, who I absolutely despise, and whose test I was frantically studying for, walked into the room and froze. He saw her, gasped, and then saw my face. His face turned red, and he screamed \u201cGET THE FUCK OUT OF MY HOUSE!!!\u201d I\u2019m pretty sure I lost some of my hearing from how loud he yelled. Anyways I put my shorts on and ran back to my quad. Now, as I lay in bed, all I can think of is how my college professor saw me naked, not just naked but rawdogging his daughter without any clothes at all. He already didn\u2019t like me, and he is a very tough grader\u2026 So I already know that I am going to absolutely bomb this final and destroy my GPA. I see him tomorrow at 11 AM\u2026 wish me luck and I\u2019ll update with what happens\n\nTLDR: Professor I hate caught me with his daughter and I have his final tomorrow",

            "I asked ChatGPT to make it appropriate for 14+ audiences, then asked it to make it more believable:\n\n\"Certainly! Here's a revised version of the story that aims to increase its believability:\n\n'As a university student, I was in the midst of finals week, and I was feeling incredibly stressed out. After a long day of studying for my ancient literature class, I decided to take a break and browse through Tinder. I hadn't used the app in a while, and I was curious to see if anyone caught my eye.\n\nI swiped right on a girl who was nearby, and to my surprise, we matched. She was a bit older than me, but she was attractive, and we hit it off in our conversations. After a few messages back and forth, she invited me over to her apartment, which was just a short distance away.\n\nWhen I arrived, she greeted me warmly and suggested we get straight to business. At first, I was a little hesitant, but I decided to go with it. Unfortunately, our encounter was interrupted just a few minutes later when we heard the front door open. My heart sank as we both froze in fear.\n\nTo my horror, the person who walked in was my ancient literature professor, who I had been struggling to impress all semester. He looked stunned when he saw me there, and it took him a moment to realize what was happening. He immediately demanded that I leave his daughter's apartment, and I quickly got dressed and left without a word.\n\nAs I walked back to my dorm, I couldn't help but think about the disastrous consequences that could arise from this encounter. I knew my professor already disliked me, and I feared that this incident could jeopardize my entire academic career. I had to face him again the next day for my final exam, and I was filled with anxiety.'\n\nIn this version, I focused more on the student's anxiety and fear, which can make the story more believable. I also added some detail to the encounter to make it more realistic. Overall, the goal is to make the story feel more like something that could happen to an average university student, rather than a purely fictional scenario.\"",

        "selftext": "So this happened a few days ago.\n\nI have a longstanding habit of buying a lottery ticket for the powerball (or megaball ect.) whenever it gets over 300 million. It's overall a very small amount per year and it's just a small investment in fun times from my point of view. Recently the prize was slowly creeping up due to no winners multiple weeks in a row (the prize gets rolled over if there is no winner). It was over a billion last week and I bought a ticket like usual. But I got too busy too take it in too check the numbers. \n\nHere is where I screwed up. I decided to give the ticket to my wife to check. Now she is a sweet lady who has never gambled anything, so she was not familiar with the process. I sent her to a local supermarket with a machine, explained how to scan the card and sent her on her merry way.\n\nA little while later I get a strange text basically saying \"you better be sitting down!!\", and then a text saying something to the effect of \"I'm never coming back to this store again...\"\n\nLater I got the full story. She scanned the ticket correctly and the machine announced that she was a winner. A full screen graphic and giant words, the works. She freaked out at the prospect of becoming billionaires (she does not know how much is shaved off for taxes, but that's a different story..), attracting attention in the store. After hyperventilating for a minute or two, she saw that the machine stated to proceed to a checkout counter, she walks over and......found out that she won $2.\n\nShe was not aware that if you get one number (or some) in the right place you can win your money back. Anyways after landing back on earth abruptly she left the store mortified at her reaction to winning $2 and now we need to find somewhere else to shop lol\n\n TL;DR Wife did not know that you can win tiny amounts of money for getting one number correct in the lotto, mistakenly thought we became billionaires, based on her reaction in the store she now needs to find a new store to shop at :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

I couldn\u2019t believe it. My heart started racing as it got to the last and then the powerball. All correct. They were all the right fucking numbers! I had won lotto. About 28mil. Shit you just dream about has happened. My brain rebooted. I was ecstatic.\n\nOne half of a second later the rational more awake part of my brain finally got involved and pointed out to the newly minted millionaire part of my brain, that I had just watched the normal draw. You know, the results. Not what was on my ticket below.\n\nThe come down was hard. Took me a solid 10 minutes to get the adrenaline out of my system and turn back to reality.\n\nWhat a fucking ride. The thrill I felt was out of this world. I\u2019m ducking broke, so my world, and many others who I could help had just changed!! Accepting the reality was hard.",

        "selftext": "In a shared hangar with several workshops, my friends and I rented a small space for our knife making enterprise. For a year, our shared kitchen and fridge functioned harmoniously, with everyone respecting one another's food. However, an anonymous individual began stealing my sandwiches, consuming half of each one, leaving bite marks, as if to taunt me.\n\nInitially, I assumed it was a one-off incident, but when it occurred again, I was determined to act. I prepared sandwiches with an extremely spicy Carolina Reaper sauce ( a tea spoon in each), leaving a note warning about the consequences of stealing someone else's food, and went out for lunch. Upon my return, chaos reigned. The atmosphere was one of panic, and a woman's scream cut through the commotion, accompanied by a child's cry.\n\nThe culprit turned out to be our cleaner's 9-year-old son, who she had been bringing to work during his school's disinfection week. He had made a habit of pilfering from the fridge, bypassing the healthy lunches his mother had prepared, in favor of my sandwiches. The child was in distress, suffering from the intense spiciness of the sauce. In my defense, I explained that the sandwiches were mine and I'd spiked them with hot sauce.\n\nThe cleaner, initially relieved by my explanation, suddenly became furious, accusing me of trying to harm her child. This resulted in an escalated situation, with the cleaner reporting the incident to our landlord and threatening police intervention. The incident strained relations within the other workshops, siding with the cleaner due to her status as a mother. Consequently, our landlord has given us a month to relocate, adding to our financial struggles.\n\nMy friends, too, are upset with me. I maintain my innocence, arguing that I had no idea a child was the food thief, and I would never intentionally harm a child. Nevertheless, it seems I am held responsible, accused of creating a huge problem from a seemingly trivial situation.\n\nThe child is ok. No harm to the health was inflicted. It still was just an edible sauce, just very very spicy.\n\nTLDR: Accidentally fed a little boy an an insanely spicy sandwich.",

            "It was hot sauce, not rat poison. This doesn't even meet the legal definition of a booby trap.\n\nKid learned a lesson. Mom learned a lesson. \n\nIt does suck that the thief was a kid. For lots of reasons.",
            "Sorry but I think you are being unfairly dealt with. Everyone else is way off. What you do with your sandwiches regardless of note is up to you. They aren't there to be stolen. I think your landlord is being completely unlawful too. We had this at a place I worked once so spiked stuff with laxitives. Fuck them. Parent is also setting a bad example and clearly kid doesn't like the shit she's forcing him to eat.",
            "Someone steals my sandwich, I'd do the same, except I wouldn't say anything once it becomes clear who stole it or took a bite.\n\nAlso, \n\n\"Fuck them kids.\"",
            "You mistake was saying you \"spiked\" the sandwich - should have said \"oh, I'm on a spicy kick and he must have stolen my food\". You went from victim to a sort of perpetrator once a child was involved. **I'm 100% on your side here**, but things could have ended differently if it wasn't clear you intended to cause someone physical pain. If you're going to basically \"set a trap\", you really need some deniability that is was indeed a trap.\n\nThis may even verge on the illegal, since you intentionally set out to cause someone pain or distress. At least in the US there are laws against \"man traps\". Example, a guy kept having his store robbed, older urban east-coast setup where there's a basement accessed from the outdoors, where deliveries come in. He'd put a chain link fence inside the basement doors, people would just cut it, so he decided to electrify it. Came to the store one morning to find a dead burglar hanging from the fence. He was charged with manslaughter and \"setting a man trap\", that's the actual language I recall.",

He could easily get into her chemicals too. What if he had allergies?\n\nFor liability purposes, the company who runs the hangar should have a cleaning contract written and signed.\n\nPeople should be going hard on the cleaner for bringing her kid to work and not using this opprotunity to teach her kid that taking other people's lunches is wrong behaviour and has consiquences.",
            "Fucked around; found out.",
            "Leaving the note and admitting it was a trap were your mistakes.\n\nYou should have said you liked spicy sandwiches and that you didn't think anyone would steal your personal property and eat it.\n\nThis puts the blame entirely on the thief and not on you.\n\nYou got yourself kicked out.",
            "You didn't fuck up.  The Mother fucked up for not supervising her kid and not teaching her kid not to be a thief.  Also the kid fucked up for being a little thief, but that could also be on the parent if the kid was poorly raised....but it's also possible he was taught not to steal and did it anyways.  The fact the mother blamed the theft victim and not her brat kid says a lot though.",
            "You should have never said you spiked the sandwich with hot sauce. This makes you culpable, and people are mad at you for good reason since you knowingly went out of your way to harm someone (regardless of the reason). You can't do that. \n\nHowever, if you were just a spicy boi then no one could be mad. You made the situation worse for yourself by discussing that you set someone up. Amateur hour.",

            "Maybe that cleaner should teach him to not touch others food that doesn\u2019t belong to him. The nerve of that woman. Did the mother knew he was stealing sandwiches and eating them all along?",
            "That little shit got what he deserved and it\u2019s BS for your friends to be mad at you, you didn\u2019t know it was a kid. The mom is at fault too for not watching her child of bringing him to her work place.",
            "Your only fuckup was admitting you did it on purpose as revenge for whoever was stealing. Should have just said you were craving spicy today and it wasn't your fault they decided to steal food. I'd have just asked what the kid ate. When he admitted to eating the sandwich, I'd have just laughed and told the mother off for letting her kid steal food. Don't even bring up the spiciness until they asked about it. Then I'd pretend as if I was in the mood for spicy food today and then promptly take a bite to show it was to my liking. Remember when you plant a trap like this, you want to be able to consume the trap yourself when management or coworkers challenge the notion that you might have planted tainted food as revenge.",

            "The child was in the wrong, but so were you; your intent was to inflict distress (if not harm) on whoever it was that was eating your food.  You had every reason to believe they would do it again, which is why you spiked your sandwich (you believed they would). There have been cases of people booby-trapping their homes / property against burglars being found guilty of injuring or murdering the burglars. Legally speaking, I think you could easily be found guilty had any true harm come to the child - especially since you made a point of placing the spiked sandwich (setting up a booby trap of sorts) and then going out to lunch (the sandwich was not intended for yourself, but for the person who had been eating them).  Your actions were deliberate and purposeful.\n\n*\"I had no idea a child was the food thief, and I would never intentionally harm a child.\"*\n\nYou did, however, intend to cause distress (if not harm) to whoever the person was.  That it was a child doesn't change that.\n\n*\"I explained that the sandwiches were mine and I'd spiked them with hot sauce.\"*\n\nThis sounds like a confession to me - which would strengthen a case against you (especially with the use of word \"spiked\" when the previous sandwiches did not contain the sauce).\n\n*\"leaving a note warning about the consequences of stealing someone else's food\"*\n\nWhat exactly did the note say, and where was it placed in relation to the sandwich?",

            "I had a similar incident and I would have been made the asshole had I came clean about it.   \n\n\nI use to bring in coffee creamer and keep it in the fridge at work. It was a low paying call center, so it brought in an interesting crowd. I noticed my creamer wasn't lasting long, so I figured I was just using a lot of it. I brought in a second bottle, and went to open it and saw someone decided to help me out by pushing the foil seal on it into the bottle vs peeling it off. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI realized It wasn't me, but someone else using it. I wrote my name on the next one hoping someone would see that it was my personal creamer and not a communal creamer. Nope, the offender didn't care. I let a few of my friends there know about it, and if they seen who it was to let me know. I started to hide it in the fridge and took decent measures to get this person to understand that I don't want to share. Didn't matter, they didn't care. I was having lunch one day, saw someone looking through the, then saw the asshole pull my creamer out, dump a liberal amount into their coffee and move on with their day, didn't know her name but could describe her appearance and what she was wearing and department. I notified my boss and I was told to quit being petty. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I bought another flavor (French Vanilla), dumped some out, put a healthy amount of salt in it, let it sit, and put my normal creamer that I liked into a little tupperware container. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA few days later I get called into HR with my supervisor. They asked me if I knew why I was there. I told them I had no idea. They asked me about my creamer. I said something along the lines of \"Oh yeah, there was a person stealing mine, I let Jacob know who it was and I was told to quit being petty.\" Jacob started to back track and the HR person said they'd deal with that next, but I can't be bringing \"tainted\" creamer into the office. I played dumb. They said they knew I was upset about someone using my creamer but that's no excuse for my actions. They said if someone had an allergy or an intolerance to something I had put in there, they would have been forced to file a police report. I repeated myself and said I have no idea what you're talking about and if they cared to explain. I did start to panic thinking I'd be getting fired over this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey told me an employee who they wouldn't name, had used some creamer in the break room, and it made their coffee incredibly salty. The coffee was coffee the employee had brought in and it ruined her coffee that she had paid for. I asked why I was being questioned on her creamer being gross. They told me that she filed a complaint, and they reached out to the supervisors to see if they knew who's creamer it was. Jacob, knowing I was annoyed about it happening, immediately turned me in. I forseen him throwing me under the bus and told them that it was impossible for that to have been mine, as I started to put mine in a smaller container so people would quit stealing it. I had just used it that morning and It didn't taste off to me. They said \"So yours isn't the french vanilla in the break room fridge?\". I told them no, I was partial to Irish Cream and would even put my name on the bottles so people knew it was personal and not shared. Told them I was putting mine in smaller containers and keeping it with my lunch bag as people were using too much of it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey apologized for accusing me, but I could tell they knew deep down inside I did it, but didn't have any evidence it was me. I told them I seen the person who was stealing mine but didn't know her name, so I couldn't file a complaint. Let them know I'd like to and they said they'd  \"file it\". Don't know what eventually happened to her, but within a few weeks she wasn't working there anymore. Don't know if it was because she was a thief or the high turnover, but I got my justice.",

        "selftext": "I (F23)'ve been in a relationship with this guy (M33) for like a year. When we started dating, after a month of getting to know each other we went to his place and did the deed. Enjoyable experience overall. BUT, after he was done, he removed the condom and...with very expert gestures, proceeded to drink his junk right out of it.  \nI was shocked and confused. In my head I was like \"Yooo man, wtf????\". He was my first partner and like...I wondered if that was...kinda normal? Common? Idk???  \nSince I used to be a people pleaser, I managed to hide my shock and disgust, and simply asked him: \"Why did you do that?\"  \nHe answered me, as if it was the most obvious thing in the world: \"It's a lot of kiloJoules of energy, I can't waste them\".  \nI was even more confused. I was literally speechless and what was being a very nice and romantical night managed to become a weird and kinda awkward situation.  \nTo make things worse, he even stated in a very dramatic tone: \"I will never allow anyone to eat my semen\". He said that like his junk was something precious...like...if someone would ever get access to that...it was like, being able to steal his soul??? Idk. It made no sense. And also, dude, nobody here is trying to steal ur precious cum, ugh.\n\nBtw, he wasn't drinking his cum in a kinky or erotic way or idk, he did it like it was an extremely serious and important deal. Why drinking ur own cum must be so dramatic???  \nWe kept dating for several months and everytime we had sex, every. single. time. he did the same thing.  \nI started to become very concerned, since usually inside the condoms there's usually some lube...I guess? He even complaint about the bad taste of the lube or the latex the condom was made of (the taste of his own cum somehow didn't bother him at all, good for him). And even if usually lube is not that toxic, I think that consuming a small amount but very often may not be the healthiest habit. Also his breath right after this \"ritual\" almost made me throw up all the times, since he even refused to brush his teeth afterwards. \"I didn't chew, I swallowed it in one gulp, so I don't need to brush my teeth\". Ew.\n\nI tried to discretely make him understand that his habit was grossing me out, by saying out loud \"EW\" or by covering my eyes, but he didn't got the clues.\n\nA year passed by. I had enough. I tried to confront him, but nope. He was unmovable. Neither the fact that his passion for his own cum was making me a little uncomfortable, nor the fact that imo eating lube could be harmful made him stop.  \nHe then proceeded to get mad. He stated that he wasn't doing anything wrong, that he just didn't want to waste \"precious substances from his body\" and that I was making a scene for nothing. I told him about his breath and he straight up accused ME of having a bad smell??? I told him that by deflecting my accuse he was just making things worse, but then he interrupted me and just told me I was insufferable. Then he just left.\n\nHe was extremely angry, I've never seen that side of him. I'm sure that he will tell me to pack my things and to leave.\n\nSo rn I'm mad, confused AND scared about his behavior. \n\n\n\nTL;DR: after the first time me and my partner had sex he drank his own cum directly from the condom. I was disgusted and after a year I asked him to stop. He got mad and I think he's about to leave me. \n\n\nEDIT:\nOMG. Well, I was right about being freaked out by his behavior having read most of the comments... Anyway pleeeease no judging about the fact that I've stayed with him for over a year (I'm really ashamed about it), the situation was very complex for me. But to cut it short, let's say that I have very low standards and not a lot of self-esteem :^(",

Something that probably started when he first started masturbating and has continued since puberty. He seems very aware that it is not normal behavior. He is also extremely defensive about it, which says it is behavior that is deeply tied to him psychologically. Somehow he feels that his own worth decreases if his sperm is left to be disposed of. \n\nIn the scale of things to be concerned about in life, I suppose this is one that falls down the list a bit - but any behavior that becomes a stumbling block in your relationship is something worth examining and talking out - and if he refuses to discuss or gets defensive, I'm not sure that's a good sign for the relationship. It begs the question - why? Why does this behavior become such a big deal for him? I can't help but feel this is tied to his past relationships, his past sexual experiences, or his inability to be completely open in his sexual behaviors.\n\nMaybe therapy, but maybe if his behavior is that off-putting, start considering that there are probably other aspects of his life he won't be willing to share either.",

She works at a very large and popular wholesale store that has hotdogs. She told me beforehand that I could come see her at work any time and there would be no trouble. \n\nI walked in the front door and walked past the card-checker girl. She did a double-take and asked if I work there. I replied  \u201cno, I do not. I am here to see an employee, however. I\u2019m looking for \u2014\u2014\u2014 in \u2014\u2014\u2014.\u201d\n\nShe sheepishly got her radio and said, \u201cmanagement to front entrance; non-emergency\u201d\n\nA manager with the largest tablet I\u2019ve ever seen strapped to her arm walked up and I explained again why I was there. She called for my GF on the radio but she was not near her radio. I apparently kicked the hornet\u2019s nest and I could hear chatter on other employee\u2019s radios. \n\n\u201cWho\u2019s that guy here to see \u2014\u2014\u2014-?\u201c\n\n\u201cAre we being audited? He looks important\u201d\n\n\u201cGUYS, LOOK BUSY\u201d \n\nI caught glances from just about every worker nearby and I could feel them trying to figure me out\n\nIt was at this time my GF got back to her radio and heard the commotion and stepped out of her office and made eye contact with me. She wrapped up her work and we went out to lunch finally. I asked her why there was such a ruckus. She said that I dress nicely and I\u2019m very polite which are characteristics of a corporate rep who comes in to fire people. That\u2019s when she also admitted to me that I sometimes have asshole resting face. I guess I need to smile more. \n\nTLDR: I surprised my GF at work and her coworkers thought I was there to perform an audit or fire somebody. ",

            "Many years ago I used to work in a call center for a major telco.  In our district there was a regional manager for basically \"corporate security\". He was the guy that if someone was getting fired would show up and escort the employee out, arrange to have their stuff sent to them.   That kind of stuff.    \n\nI had worked there for just about forever and had known him for over a decade and we were work friends.   Every time he would come into town he would let me know and we would meet up for breakfast/lunch to catch up on life, kids, whatever.    \n\nWhenever he was coming in to fire someone he always wore a salmon-colored tie.  It was pretty obvious after a decade of people seeing him come into the building and people leave and him wearing his tie that it was his firing tie.  We had talked about it at lunch one time and he said it just kind of happened that a few times he had worn that tie to an employee meeting and it just became his standard issue when he had to do that.    \n\nEvery time he walked onto to floor of our call center, wearing that tie, it was like watching a herd of cats on a glass floor.  Everyone popped up in their cubicles, people started whispering, it got tense.   The amusing thing was that 99% of the time it had nothing to do with our unit and he was just passing through and would stop at my desk to say hi or arrange lunch later, but that didn't negate the power of the tie.    \nA few years before they closed our office and laid everyone off he showed up one day in a pair of slack, a sport coat and no tie.  He was finally retiring and wanted to say so long before he left.   Some of the people around my desk heard he was retiring and came up to say bye, good luck, etc.  As they were saying good-bye more than a few commented on and chuckled about the tie and he said he had retired it to the back of his closet to never be worn again.",

Externally I look like an authority figure, internally I'm as stern as a golden retriever.\n\n1) I was waiting outside of a club at one point, my gf was in there with her friends and I was just hanging out until they were ready to go. A small group of inebriated but friendly guys came up to me to show me their IDs, thinking I was the bouncer/doorman. \n\nI gave them a raised eyebrow (internally: the fuck? \ud83e\udd14 ) which they interpreted as declining them entry. One pulled out a few bills with intent to bribe me. By then I'd realised what had happened, and said \"that won't help you here mate\". Feeling guilty, I then told them, \"you'll behave yourselves won't you? I'd hate to have to come have a chat with you\". They all eagerly agreed, and I was left trying explain to the next group of people who had pulled out their IDs that the door check was inside and downstairs.\n\n2) I was having a beer with a mate, went to the bathroom, and as I entered a guy exited the cubicle with well powdered nose and wide eyes, because he thought I was a cop. Then he realised I wasn't, and told me so. To which I laughed. All good...\n\nFollowed by a nervous, \"you're not are you?\", \"do I look like one?\" \ud83d\udc6e\"..yes. It's my birthday. Friends bought it. uhm..did you want a bump?\" \"Is it really your birthday?\" \"Um..yea..Yes.\" Then he showed me his ID. Really was his birthday. So I just said \"happy birthday\" and went to take a leak.\n\nAfterwards, bar tender said the guy had bought me and my mate drinks, and when I nodded over to him, he did the whole \"omfg, that's the guy! that's the cop!\". I like to think we both got a fun story out of that interaction.\n\n**tl;dr** I apparently look like a cop, bouncer, auditor, and a professor (so far of history, nursing, and architecture).

            "Many years ago when I was single, I really wanted to try this nice restaurant in downtown Jacksonville, FL (Matthew's Restaurant in San Marco). They had a tasting menu and I wanted to treat myself to a nice night out. I was a bit nervous to do something like that solo, but figured wth, it'll be a good time. I had tickets to the symphony for after dinner.\n\nI wore a suit and when I arrived, I could immediately tell the staff were going out of their way to be extra cheery to me. It was odd. The waitress was so nervous serving me, at one point she knocked a half-full glass of water into my lap. I was there for a couple of hours and it was honestly one of the best meals I've ever had.\n\nAt the end, I asked if she was new and told her she did a fantastic job. She said that since I was dressed well and dining solo, they assumed I was a restaurant review critic that was there to do a write-up for the restaurant.\n\nOn a side note, if anyone is nervous about fine-dining solo like that, just do it. It's great because you can eat at your own pace, really enjoy whatever it is you're eating/drinking, and you don't have to feel forced to make conversation with anyone if you don't want.",

My boyfriend goes to takes his wallet out of his pocket to get the hotel keycard and a small, black, square packet that looks exactly like a condom falls out. My heart immediately sinks because my boyfriend and I have never used condoms so this clearly isn't meant for us.\n\nMy boyfriend immediately grabs it and shoves it in his pocket then continues to open the door, obviously hoping I didn't notice what just fell out. I ask him what that was and his face immediately gets bright red and he starts acting extremely nervous which I've never seen him do before. At this point I am so flustered and angry that I just leave the room while I hear him calling my name behind me. I went down to the pool for a few hours ignoring his phone calls and idk what I'm gonna do. I spend all day just trying to distract myself with random things to do around Vegas.\n\nWhen I get back to the hotel he tells me he's sorry but the doesn't understand why I was so angry over it. I tell him of course I'm angry about it cause clearly that condom wasn't for us so wtf was he gonna use it for. When I said this he gets a puzzled looks then immediately goes to his suitcase and grabs a bunch of these tiny black packages like the one I saw fall out of his pocket.\n\nI take one and look at it. They are individually packaged butt wipes, not condoms. He said he's been having really bad diarrhea the last couple days and snuck off to buy these at one of the convenience stores in the hotel, but got really embarrassed in the moment when it fell out. I ignored him for a whole day on our vacation cause he wanted a clean butt. I apologized and it ended up being hilarious to us\n\nTLDR: ignored my boyfriend for a day cause I thought a condom fell out of his pocket, it was an individually packaged butt wipe for his diarrhea",

It will be harder to adapt to these things the longer you leave it, at least they don\u2019t truly know and understand the full complexities and depth of what Death is. It will make them wiser to know, they need to know the pain of loss and realise what it means, to see the meaning in it and what they must do and from that how they should live. \n\nMy Mother was always honest with me, and even though it was painful at the time I can see in hindsight that it was for the best.

One of the probable reason for yhis would be that I didn't have social interaction with anyone of my age group most were adults.

            "Something similar happened with my child at around the same age. Classic example of a kid being a little too smart for his own good (in this particular instance) and of the parent not predicting the direction his child's brain was going to go with interesting new information. I was reading a book about stars to him at bedtime, and he very much liked the concept of exploding stars. As we were talking about how the process is different between huge red stars like Betelgeuse and normal size stars like ours, it suddenly clicked in his brain that this will happen to the sun someday. He started crying and telling me he doesn't want the sun to explode because then we wouldn't be able to live at home anymore and doesn't know where we'd go. Whoops.  \n\n\nI was completely caught off  guard. At this stage, him expressing complicated feelings through talking was still pretty uncommon so I wasn't expecting this. Plus, it was bedtime and this wasn't exactly the best time to have an existential crisis.  However, I also didn't want to straight up lie to him to make the problem go away. I tried explaining to him that our sun still has billions of years left, but of course a unit of time like that doesn't mean much to a 3 year old. He responded with \"But its still going to happen! Where will we go???\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe didn't really have any exposure to the concept of death yet, and as far as he was concerned his family would all still be on Earth billions of years from now when the sun would start dying. I decided that telling him this won't happen during his lifetime probably wasn't a good idea, as it was opening the door for dreaded concepts that his distressed brain didn't need to be thinking about right before bed. Instead, we talked about how life only exists on our planet because of little bits of other exploded stars, and how the material from dead stars goes on to form new stars, and that everything around him is part of that cycle, including himself! That seemed to help significantly. It got his brain thinking down a more positive path, and he was able to fall asleep. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIts now a year later, and he still loves talking about space and stars so I guess mission accomplished. I definitely put a little more thought into the subject matter we explore together now and how it is framed, but it can be hard to anticipate where their brains will go when considering new subjects.",

I was close to him, I loved my grandpa, and I was only 3 years old, it was a silly game between me and him, idk how it started, but I had that ingrained in my brain and it's something I'll remember till the day I die.\n\nSo...one day he was halfway to the doctor when he suddenly felt it, his day was coming short and he didn't wanted to spend his last days on a big cold city, he wanted to spend his last days on that warm and lovely small town...he didn't make it he died just minutes away from my parents place, when my aunts and uncles arrived home with him, all crying, they layed him on his bed and the only thing 3 year old me understood was \"family is sad because Grandpa is sleeping, but I know how to wake him up\".

            "So, I\u2019m actually about to graduate school to become a licensed embalmer and funeral director. During our course work, we had to study the psychology towards death and grief symptoms. Four year olds, according to psychologists, don\u2019t truly grasp the finality of death. They generally are able to understand that it basically amounts to \u201cgoing somewhere\u201d\u2026 forever - whatever that big word means. Think of Forest Gump\u2019s dad going on \u201cvacation.\u201d Now, unless death occurs to an immediate family member or pet at this age, generally young kids also perceive death as, well, something that doesn\u2019t get close. It\u2019s for others. I would say that your child, as awful  and torturous as it may seem to you, has broken a revelatory barrier on what death is. Based upon the reaction, I\u2019d say they may have been silently stewing over this for a minute and your photo sort of brought it home. This is not a bad thing. Especially if it was induced via a filtered photo and not something more tragic. Be honest, open, and answer any questions that may arise. Comfort them, of course, but also know that this revelation was always going to happen one day. I\u2019d take the trauma of my imagination and a filtered photo over actually losing my mom or another immediate family member any day. Watching my mother lose her dad was a pretty traumatic experience for me whenever I was 8. It was my first close encounter with death. I grew up on a farm. I knew chickens and goats could die; stop being. It was one way we got food. But at that point in my little life, mom and dad were always going to be the same. So were my grandparents. We\u2019re were always going to be around and together. Until one day, they weren\u2019t. That was the day I saw the strongest woman I ever knew be knocked on her knees. It shook me as a child.\n\nEdit: I was trying to think of word when typing all that - it was Distant. Children that young perceive death as something distant. That photo was a imaginary close encounter.\n\nEdit 2: And no, you shouldn\u2019t have known because every person is different with their own reactions toward death- even children. One would never know until it happens. So, don\u2019t beat yourself up. My parents could never have known how my brother and I would have reacted to the death of my grandfather. Hell, my dad was in the worst spot because he had to be there for us and my mom. And my response to that event was to choose to become an embalmer/funeral director to take care of other people who are grieving like my mom did all this years ago. Don\u2019t feel bad, don\u2019t kick yourself. If anything, there\u2019s always the hope that you\u2019re now raising a future mortician, I guess.",

Unfortunately you can't control when a child (has to) learn about death, but it sounds like you're and they're handling it well other than the photo incident, when it occured to them that they might experience death more personally than just as a concept.

            "The passage of time is a hard thing to understand, especially when you're a kid. I can remember staying up late at night panicking about my grandparents dying. I LOVED them (and still do). I'm in my 40s now and all but one of them is dead, and honestly it wasn't nearly as sad as I imagined it would be when I was little. When the time came for them it was the right time, and they were OK with it and I was OK with it. My nana who is my favorite person in the world is 95 now, and she's lived a wonderful life and when her time comes it will be OK too.  But even if I could go back in time and explain that to myself when I was little, I don't think little me could have gotten my head around it. A kid is picturing something traumatic and sudden happening to a relatively young, healthy person and the kind of gentle fadeout over decades is not something you can understand until you've experienced it. (I've also had healthy family members die suddenly and that's every bit as horrifying as what I imagined as a kid, but thankfully that's not what happens to most people).

I couldn\u2019t imagine being somewhere forever, even if it\u2019s suppose to be magical. I started question my own reality and what was the purpose of it all do that was the end goal.\n\nLong story short, I came out fine so I wouldn\u2019t stress about this too much lol."

        "selftext": "I am an assistant in heart surgery. I work with over a dozen different surgeons. The one Dr is one of the OGs at this place, been around forever, seen it all, done it all, nothing really bothers him. He's very quiet and reserved during surgery. I'm new here, so I'm really trying to make a good impression.\n\nThe case before I worked with this doctor was literally the smoothest case I've ever assisted. I was truly a step ahead the entire case, and the surgeon didn't have to ask me to do anything, because I was already doing it. It felt so great! So, when I saw my assignment was to work with him, I was super pumped to get a chance to build on how great the previous case went.\n\nSo, there were are, in the middle of the surgery. The heart is arrested is diastole, the heart-lung machine is cycling the blood instead, and we have the heart literally cut open to replace a valve. Right in the middle of placing the valve sutures into the heart, he handed me 2 of them, and I went to place a hemostat clamp on them outside of the open chest, like I had with the rest of them. This is a routine and imprecise move, so I was kind of nonchalant about it. Unfortunately the surgeon pulled his hand back right as I went to clamp, and I clamped a motherfucking metal clamp onto his pinkie knuckle. He lurched back, and screamed in pain, looked at me and said, \"NOW WHY THE FUCK DID YOU DO THAT FOR?!?\"\n\nI was speechless, being caught totally off guard. Obviously I hadn't done it on purpose. This reserved and quiet surgeon did a just-scored-a-TD-in-the-SuperBowl spike with the now contaminated-with-his-own-blood needle driver he had been holding onto the floor, ripped off his gown and gloves, and stormed out of the room.\n\nThe entire room was pindrop quiet. What do we do with this open chest and open heart without a surgeon? What happens now? My career flashed before my eyes. My ears burned like lit sparklers, and sweat started running down my neck. My surgical goggles started fogging up. For a second I felt likei was going to pass out. But 30 seconds later we heard the surgeon slamming the metal panel on the scrub sink, and we knew he was scrubbing back in. \n\nHe came back in the room a few minutes later, clearly red hot mad, but we went right back to work and finished the case without a single word about what happened. When he was getting ready to leave the room, I apologized sincerely, which he kind of resentfully accepted.\n\nTL;DR: I ripped a world class heart surgeon's hand open with a metal clamp in the middle of surgery, which REALLY pissed him off, but he washed the blood off and went right back to work like the professional that he is, and I almost died from shame.\n\nEdit: marked NSFW due to the fucking \"F word\" and because apparently I'm literally NSFW\n\nEdit for clarification: don't mistake my comment about being nonchalant as being careless. The point was that I wasn't in the chest, I was back off to the side just clipping sutures together, so it's a different kind of movement then handling tissues inside the chest. My mistake was in having tunnel vision and not seeing the unexpected movement of the surgeon, not in how I was clipping the sutures together\n\nOne final edit: HOLT SHIT. I scrub out from a heart transplant today to find that I've hit the front page. So I wanted to add a couple more details. The surgeon was fine, just had the side of his knuckle pinched in there tips of a hemostat hard enough to tear the skin a little. I love my job so much, and am pretty good at it. We've worked together since and it never even came up, because he trusts my skillset. Also, if you have any questions about heart surgery, feel free to ask. We do some awesome gnarly shit.",

There was just a cork screw type opener and since it was an old bottle the cork broke.

I had only been working for maybe 2 weeks, and it was the first surgical extraction I had ever assisted with. We were about halfway done, and the Dentist needed to administer more anesthetic. I passed him the local anesthetic syringe loaded with cartridge and needle, he placed the local and passed it back it me. 5+ years later, I still have NO IDEA how we both fumbled it, but I ended up shoving the just used needle into the dentist's palm. He immediately jumped up, began shouting and swearing LOUDLY, and slammed his chair into the opposite wall in our op. He made such a scene, the dental coordinator came to check on me to make sure I was OK, after he stormed off. This poor patient was only the second patient of the day, her roots still needed to be extracted, and now she had to submit a blood sample due to the sharps incident. And I had to continue working with the same dentist for the rest of the day. I was mortified!

Complacently, I use this time to introduce myself to the surgeon, while jokingly saying, \u201cso-and-so couldn\u2019t be here today, so you\u2019re stuck with me.\u201d \n\nI turn to place the water basin where it was needed and bobbled the transfer. Immediately noticing that, my attention bolts to it, and I grossly overcorrect. Basin goes flying in to the sterile table. Water covers every square inch of the table, instruments go flying. Scopes fall to the floor. Surgeon even gets water, thankfully sterile, on his face. I would have liked to just die right there. \n\nThankfully the surgeon laughed it off and merely had to rescrub while I sprinted to make a whole new table and,  luckily, had backup instruments available. He did deservedly tease me throughout the case though.",

        "selftext": "This happened many years ago, when I was but a young man in college.  But the story actually starts about 18 years before that, when I was a baby.\n\nLike most kids, I hated getting soap in my eyes in the bath.  Even the gentle \u201cbaby shampoo\u201d would send me into a rage.  My dad, being the intrepid problem solving sort with a penchant for over engineering, came up with a sort of 360 degree visor that my hair would stick through.  Then, they could wash my hair and the soapy water would just roll off.  It was great.  It kind of looked like a flower on my head, so my parents would say I was \u201cflowering while showering.\u201d\n\nEventually, the OG visor got mildew and was disposed of, but my dad made a few over the years.  He ultimately stopped when he decided that I should be able to wash my hair without getting soap in my eyes, but I wasn\u2019t having it and started making my own.  Over time, \u201cflower hats\u201d for this exact purpose became mass produced and I switched over to just buying them as needed.  Never got soap in my eyes!  It was great!\n\nWell, by the time I was 20 and living in my own apartment in college, I still hadn\u2019t kicked the ol\u2019 flower hat.  I was flowering while showering every day, living my best life.  Cue a cute girl staying at my place and suggesting we take a shower together before fucking.  She asked me to wash her hair and brush conditioner through it, which apparently felt really good to her and was a major turn on.  When I was done, she offered to wash my hair.  I didn\u2019t think that would do anything for me, but I said \u201csure!\u201d\n\nI then reached out of the shower for the drawer where I kept my flower hat and put it on.  At first she laughed and thought I was joking, even after I explained what it was.  But then I think she noticed how it looked kind of old and used and faded, and that it would be strangely elaborate to keep a flower hat in my bathroom for the occasional joke.\n\nTo her credit, she washed my hair while I wore it.  We didn\u2019t end up having sex that night\u2014I can\u2019t remember her explanation\u2014but after she left the next morning she didn\u2019t return my calls or AIM messages.  \n\nI didn\u2019t stop flowering while showering immediately after that.  I would just say, \u201coh, I washed my hair already\u201d if the situation came up again.  But when I met my now-wife, I knew it was time to give it up.  So I no longer flower while\nI shower, I just live with the occasional pain of getting soap in my eyes.\n\nBut you better believe that when we had kids, I immediately got them flower hats.  My wife thinks they\u2019re brilliant.  She has no idea of my dark past.  And every once in a while I look at my kids\u2019 flower hats, and I hear them calling to me, beckoning me to don them.  I haven\u2019t succumbed yet, but I think it\u2019s only a matter of time\u2026\n\nTL;DR:  Flowered while I showered; got a good hair wash but nothing else.\n\nEdit:  [A general idea of what my flower hat looked like in college.](https://imgur.com/a/gRU8Mk4)",

        "selftext": "Obvious and obligatory not today, but an ongoing fuck up. \n\nI hate jeans. I *hate* jeans. I will wear them as necessary to not look like a scrub but I\u2019d honestly rather wear slacks or khakis as needed. My preferred bottoms are basketball shorts or sweatpants, and I can and do wear them almost all the time. \n\nWhen I changed location at work about 6-7 years ago, I moved to a position that requires long pants, and I obviously chose sweats because I may as well be somewhat comfortable at work. \n\nWhat I failed to understand is that the sweatpants are what Ron Burgundy would describe as \u201cflattering in the crotchal region\u201d. This is not a brag-I am average in that department. I\u2019m also a grower, not a shower. I know it seems ridiculous, but I was not aware of this function my pants were providing. I just don\u2019t really think about my penis that much. I also don\u2019t expect anyone to be taking a good long look. Call me naive I guess. \n\nA couple weeks ago, I was informed by a female coworker that she was warned about where she looked on a job-by a male coworker-as I was \u201cslinging penis\u201d which is a term I\u2019d never heard and baffled me. My bulge is/was very prominent. My surprise led me to asking others if this was actually the case, since that\u2019s not exactly the vibe I\u2019m looking to put out at work. I\u2019m happily married and not looking. I was further informed that indeed many people **had** noticed and commented, though obviously not to me, that I was really putting myself out there-as the saying goes. To make matters more complicated? Worse? I had switched to first shift several years ago and the people had also discussed the subject at length. The result was that I must be going without underwear(not true). \n\nTL;DR I\u2019ve been living the \u201cdicks out for Harambe\u201d life for years/my coworkers are a bunch of meat gazers. \n\nThe Aftereffects: wife and I talk about it. I show her the goods, she kinda shrugs but laughs at the situation. I leave before she\u2019s awake and change out of work clothes first thing on getting home. But of course that can\u2019t be the end of it. \n\nJust a few days later we get pizza with her family. Her aunt lost part of her jaw to cancer years back and has a tough time chewing. I am kinda known in the pizza shop because wife and I like their breadsticks. Wife likes hers doughy and because they know my name and face, they always do a great job. One of the women referred to me as her best customer a week prior to the revelations. \n\nI order and return with pizza and breadsticks, which are uncharacteristically, for in laws, made better than usual. Mother in law says \u201cmaybe (me) should get our pizza all the time!\u201d Which causes my wife to laugh, give me a look and ask \u201chave you been wearing your sweatpants in there too?\u201d Causing confusion for the in laws. \n\nSo I sigh and explain to her fairly conservative parents and cackling aunt what I recently learned, prompting her mother, bless her heart, asks, \u201cdid she say slinging or swinging?\u201d",

            "Honestly, as a woman, I believe that if you\u2019re dressing comfortably, and people think you\u2019re dressing provocatively (in sweaters no less) then it\u2019s not you with an issue. Truth is if they think you\u2019re sexy in sweats, they\u2019d all get hard ons for you in my professional clothing as well. You can\u2019t control what and how others think about you, so it doesn\u2019t matter what you wear. And if you make a sudden change to something more \u201cappropriate\u201d they\u2019ll notice and make the same comments. So I say do what\u2019s comfortable and take it as a compliment that you can rock sweats because not many people can. And if it\u2019s the comments which are truly uncomfortable, try different underwear that hide your package a little more. Regardless though, you should be comfortable at work, it\u2019s the only way to get the most work done, and if you have sweats you can pass off as work pants, then freaking awesome. \n\nAlso, my FIL and husband both wear business casual pants and have the same issues they do I\u2019m sweats. And as a women who is bustier with a giant tattoo on her chest, I know full well how how it is to hide a package without wearing a baggy turtleneck, and even my doctor (female) has commented on just how large of a chest I have. People will talk regardless of what you wear, so, again, be as comfy as you can.",

I played sports when I was younger and have muscular legs with a smaller waist, so nothing ever fits me right.  If the pants fit my legs, they're too lose in the waist, and if the pants fit my waist then they're too tight in the legs.  \n\nAfter years of searching, I finally found a khaki design that has elastic in parts of the waist to pull the waist tighter and they fit perfect.  So I bought a bunch of them and donated all of my other khaki pants to Goodwill.  I wore my new pants to school for a few weeks, and one day I stood in front of the bathroom mirror and took a picture to send to my wife to show her how good the pants looked on me.  Unfortunately they fit too well.  My wife sent me back my picture with an arrow drawn on it pointing to the highly visible outline of my penis.  \n\nInstantly I realized I had been showing off the goods to every one of my students for the past few weeks.  I felt horrible, I can only imagine how uncomfortable I made those poor kids.  I left work immediately, told them I had gotten sick, and went straight to the nearest clothing store.

        "selftext": "A couple of months ago I asked my parents if I was allowed to have sex in my room. My gf and I usually had sex in the woods, but it became too uncomfortable and unsafe, so I decided to embrace the embarrassment of asking my mom and dad for permission to sleep with my gf in my bed. I never wanted to have that conversation with my parents, but I wanted to show them that I was mature enough to talk to them instead of sneaking my gf in and out of my room when no one was watching. Cue the awkward \"can I have sex in my room\" conversation. My mom struggled to accept the fact that I was sexually active and got upset at me for expecting her to allow me to have sex under her roof. In other words, the answer was no. I was 17 at the time. \n\nMy mom completely lost her mind after that conversation and decided to start \"hiking\" all of a sudden, which was an obvious excuse to patrol the woods where my gf and I had sex. She even managed to convince other like-minded moms to \"hike\" with her because my gf and I were not the only teenagers hooking up in the woods. I called them The Neighbor Wood Watch. My gf and I were forced to go deeper into the woods to lower the risk of not only being caught by real hikers but also by mother hikers aka the NWW. I was confidently leading the way to our new sex spot until I realized I had no idea where we were anymore. I was low key experiencing post nut clarity but without the nut. There were no signs or trails anywhere. My gf and I spent most of the afternoon retracing our steps instead of having sex. \n\nI don't know how long we were lost, but it was beginning to get dark when we made it out of the woods. My gf was not happy with me at all. She made it clear that she was done fucking in the woods forever. My mom successfully made the woods fuck proof and cock-blocked me. Not much has changed since I turned 18. I'm still living at home with the leader of the NWW. My gf and I are not having as much sex as we used to because the woods are off limits and we're too poor to pay for privacy. For the record, if you're in my position due to the increase in moms in the woods, I'm sorry. \n\nTL:DR I asked my parents if I could have sex in my room instead of in the woods. My mom said no and made it her mission in life to prevent me from having sex anywhere.",

It is completely plausible that an 18 yo is going to have sex and that they need a safe place in which to have it.\n\nI do not see myself telling them no, but I also wonder how I would feel if one of them, at 18yo, asked if they could do it in their room.

So, the question is\u2026where?\n\nThe answer is simple, and pretty clich\u00e9: get a room!\n\nSo, what room? Hotel/motel room? Motorhome? These solutions are not cheap. More cost effective: a tent perhaps? I suppose some could possibly make use of a storage space, but that is not a legitimate use of a storage space.\n\nGood luck finding a space!

            "Happened to me a couple months ago. Don\u2019t like to think about it because I was absolutely mortified, but yup, negligent dropping of an f-bomb. Was in a Zoom meeting for work which we normally *never* use - it\u2019s always Teams. I hadn\u2019t used Zoom in over a year, at least (and even then it was for a group I belong to, not work). So Dumbo here didn\u2019t realize the mic was on. Somebody was talking about a process and I muttered, \u201cEvery *fucking* time,\u201d and DING! DING! Two chats came in on Teams from work friends yelling, \u201cYOUR MIC IS ON!!!\u201d Omg. Instant shock and horror. \n\nThe dept. manager - great guy, but a real Goody Two-Shoes, WWJD bracelet-wearing type - heard me along with several others. Thankfully, *not* my direct boss who is a super-nice lady but even more uptight than the manager. I think she never would have looked the same way at me again. Trust me, the f-word has never passed her lips in her life. \n\nI did not get in trouble but boy, did I learn my lesson. Nothing like that happening to teach you to keep a sharp eye on the Mute button no matter what you\u2019re doing!",

During the meeting he was having his own sidebar with himself, making sarcastic remarks and just keeping himself amused.\n\nSomeone on the meeting said something particularly dumb, Don drew the phone up to his face and yelled an expletive-laced comment about how dumb the idea was.\n\nThe meeting all of a sudden went quiet, and the speaker said, \u201csorry, did someone have feedback they\u2019d like to share?\u201d\n\nDon double checked that the phone was still muted, but in a brief moment of terror threw his phone across the room thinking he had yelled so loud it had bypassed the mute function.

Stop fucking saying thank you! No one gives a fuck!\u201d \u2026and then I hear a noise come through my headset. I pulled it up from around my neck and realized that the side button had not disconnected me from the call. It had unmuted me. \n\nI called my boss immediately to confess, and his first response was, \u201cI know. I was still on the call.\u201d I just about died. He was very gracious though. The best part was that I came in for the next few days to find little printouts of the transcript taped up on my name tag, under my keyboard, in my desk drawers\u2026sigh. \n\nI also had to call the head of Marcomm to give him a heads up so that he could edit the recording before it got posted on the global website.
