Everything here sucks and is incredibly hard, including finding a job. I have been unemployed since Covid hit my country and just recently i managed to finally find a job. Covid is still raging here, since they won\u2019t vaccinate us, so most times we work from home.\n\nI was dating this girl for about 9 months, which i know isn\u2019t a long time but since I\u2019m leaving the country in a few months forever, i really invested myself into this relationship cause we planned to leave together and everything was going so smoothly. My anxiety was practically gone and i was really happy after a really long life of being depressed. \n\nYesterday, out of nowhere she breaks up with me and tells me that she isn\u2019t feeling the relationship anymore and that I\u2019m a really good guy and she doesn\u2019t want to hurt my feelings in the long run. Which destroys me but i understand. I tell her to give us a another chance and she says no, it\u2019s better this way. She\u2019s a very honest person so i believe her and leave. I accept the outcome even tho i immediately start crying.\n\nAnyway, today im still pretty bummed out but i gotta go to the office for a couple of hours and my boss is there to help me which is a big relief since i really didn\u2019t feel like working. I take a smoke break and get reminded of some memories and i start crying a little bit. I go back upstairs and my boss immediately finds out that I\u2019ve been crying and insists on me telling him what happened, which i do.\n\nHe looks me dead in the eyes and says \"Wow, you were crying over that? Such a weak person, i don\u2019t think you are a good fit for the compony if that\u2019s the stuff you are worried about. I think you should leave\" at this point i start laughing, cause this is clearly a joke right? right? Wrong. He looked at me like im insane and asked me to leave immediately. So i pack up my stuff and do as im told.\n\nYesterday i had a girlfriend whom i loved and a job and a good future ahead of me. Now im just a guy who has to leave his country and everyone he loves because he was born in one of the worst places possible and he\u2019s doing it completely alone and broken. Honestly maybe boys should not cry.\n\nTL;DR: My girlfriend broke up with me. I opened up to my boss and he thought i was weak so he fired me.\n\nEDIT: Wow, you guys made my day a million times better!!! I\u2019d give you all hugs and golds if internationally usable credit cards where a thing here and i could buy Reddit coins. But since that\u2019s not possible, I\u2019ll send all my love.\n\nEDIT2: Holyshit, This blew up!!!!! You guys are amazing!!!!!! Thanks for all the awards and kind words. I have learned so much by just reading your replies and i have definitely gained a new perspective on my life. I will cherish your words forever. Also I\u2019m sorry if i can\u2019t reply to all your kind comments. I will try my best to reply to as many as i can. Also also, for people who ask, I\u2019m moving to Germany on a school scholarship and will definitely update you all beautiful people. Much love to all of you.",

            "A few months ago I had an employee hit a really rough patch with his lady. He called me up in the middle of the night asking if I could pick him up because he had to leave his house. This guy is tough, spent time in prison, tattoos from head to toe, left his past behind and has become an honest person bettering himself every day... when I picked him up, I took him over to the bar I run, sat him down with a big glass of water and he cried. He cried hard, loud, painful, sobbing, snot bubbles out the nose cry. I sat and listened, refilled his water and listened more. His mom had died the month before from covid and it was taking its toll on his relationship since his whole extended family all shared the same roof. I never thought less of this man, not even once because he showed that side of him to me. I made sure he got back home ok once he cried it out and calmed down and the next day he worked, he came in to my office and gave me a hug and said, \"Bro, I've never had a boss like you man. You have no idea what that meant to me, I had noone else to call, thank you man. Bro, I love you for what you did.\" \n\nTldr: I had bosses like yours, the taught me to be a better person. \n\nGood luck on your journey.",
            "I wasn\u2019t born in Iran but I am Iranian and I just want to give you props for being comfortable crying and showing emotions. I can relate to the cultural implications and the oppressive feeing that you can\u2019t show weakness.",

            "Hey man, fuck your boss he\u2019s an asshole. You\u2019re leaving Iran so you still have that to look forward to, don\u2019t give up",
            "I\u2019m sorry that this happened to you! I hope when you settle in your new home you\u2019ll meet some lovely new friends and colleagues who you can express your (completely normal and natural!) emotions around without judgement! Good luck!",
            "Daadash;\n\nIt's hard to believe our (I say our, though I'm only half Iranian) country has once born wise men like these two. Emulate them. Let them be your role model, not these incomplete men that you encounter. It seems they've forgotten. But not you. You are enough.\n\n> Men who suffer not, attain no perfection. The plant most pruned by the gardeners is that one which, when the summer comes, will have the most beautiful blossoms and the most abundant fruit.

            "fuuuuuuck your former boss, seriously...what a piece of shit!",
            "I usually dont comment much, but my GF of 2.5 years also broke up with me for the same reason. I am still baffled by it and dont know where it comes from. I have been bawling my eyes out for almost 2 days. Today is the first day for me that I feel okay.\n\nI cried in front of my team leader at work too, he was luckily a bit more understanding than yours and asked if I wanted the day off. Your Boss is just a D***, so dont fret too much about that!\n\nShowing your feelings is completely normal - dont be afraid to show it if you feel like crying!\n\nIf I may offer some advice: cry as much as you want, and let yourself get over it in the time you need. When you get over it, you will realize you have grown, and you became the stronger person in the end!\n\nAs a part of a quote that I would think is very fitting: Journey before destination : it is not about where you end up, but how you arrived there. If you grow, your journey becomes ever more exciting!\n\nGood luck my internet friend!",
            "Take the time to grieve, you are human and how you were treated is awful.\n\nI truly wish there were more that could be done to help but at the least know that dealing with a breakup is a huge thing and it takes more than 2hrs to work past it.\n\nYour boss made a big mistake, the wold needs more caring people.  Emotions aren't weakness, dismissing them and judging a man's worth by not having them is the sign of a weak man.",
            "I can't really say much because everyone else has said it but again you're not weak crying is normal and healthy. Showing emotion is show strength rather than weakness to me because men are so shunned emotionally it takes a lot. I'm so sorry and I am certain things will get better for you. Good luck!",
            "Your boss is an ass. If you weren't meant to cry, you wouldn't have tear ducts or emotions. \n\nYou didn't deserve that and you did nothing wrong. I know I'm just some stranger on the internet, but I think you're pretty awesome and I sincerely hope you continue to be strong and unapologetic for your emotions. \n\nYou are pretty cool, OP. Keep being you. The world needs more people like you.",
            "About your edit, hugs?  HUGS??  HUGS!!!???!!!  How weak.  You're not a good fit...\nJust kidding around.  Seriously, sorry about the gf, ex-boss is an ass, nothing wrong with having feelings.",
            "You don\u2019t need to feel bad. It\u2019s a natural emotion, your boss just sucks. Hope you get better",
            "The only one who fucked up is your boss.\nMay i ask where do you go when you leave your country?",
            ">Honestly maybe boys should not cry\n\nNo. Just, no. I'm honestly jealous of your ability to express your emotions. I'm a guy that doesn't cry, like ever. It's like something's broken inside of me. I just can't bring myself to cry, I always feel like what if someone sees me or hears me, even if I'm alone in my apartment, what if the neighbors hear me or if someone walks in (I don't live alone). Even when my dad died a few years ago, I had to actively put in the effort to cry into a pillow when I was alone. Then I started crying at the cemetery during the burial and was told, you guessed it, to not cry. Never cried after. Breaking yourself to fit into a dumb stereotype is not fun.\n\nI hate my country too and am hoping to get out as well. Good luck and safe travels. I hope things turn out well for you.",
            "Your boss sucks. Wishing you all the best",
            "I don\u2019t see any fuck up here on your part. It sucks that your relationship ended, and, as much as it may hurt right now, it definitely is for the best if she wasn\u2019t feeling the same way you are. You deserve someone who loves you as much as you love them. \n\n\nAnd your boss is right; you weren\u2019t a good fit at that company because it sounds like it is run by a giant asshole. You deserve to work somewhere that shows people compassion. Your boss it perpetuating toxic masculinity. The reality is REAL MEN HAVE FEELINGS. It is okay to cry. It is HEALTHY to cry and show the emotions you are feeling. \n\n\nI hope you won\u2019t change your plans to leave. A fresh start will be good for you, and I am sure you will soon find yourself surrounded by people who are deserving of your time, affection and loyalty.",
            "Crying isn't a weakness. Hiding your feelings because you're scared of what people think is a weakness.\n\nBest of luck. You'll find that it works out well. I hope that your new destination isn't so closed minded.",
            "Out the company, because fuck that piece of shit.",
            "This is not a fuck up on your part. Don't you dare blame yourself for any of this.",
            "Your boss is a pathetic, sniveling excuse for a man. A 'real man' takes care of those who are in distress. \n\nI'm an extremely large and fairly strong man. The type of guy that looks like he enjoys chopping down trees with his fists. Yes, I absolutely cry when applicable. I've held a crying stranger and cried with them after they were in a crash. That's manly af.",
            "I hope wherever you\u2019re off to has a better culture surrounding men and their emotions. Men and women are virtually identical from a psychological perspective, any different behaviors are all learned from experiences and one\u2019s environment. The idea that a man should suppress his emotions is an example of what people mean when they bring up the phrase \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d in one\u2019s culture, and repressing your feelings is a great way to develop medical and psychological issues long term. Feel your feelings. Grieve. Share your pain with those you trust, and embrace the fresh journey you\u2019re about to embark on. I am truly rooting for you my friend, one of many who will await you when your toes touch greener pastures.",
            "No fuck up pal. Where you headed?",
            "Dude, no TIFU at all.\n\nAs I grew older I realized that crying isn't the weak thing. It's the healthy thing. It's ok and human to do so.\n\nAlso - better to find out things are not working out after 9months than after a couple of increasingly unhappy years.\n\nThings will get better - all the best to you!",
            "I'm Iranian and just so you know, do not invest into a girl until you've found built a foundation of self-esteem. My father and mother had me and I left Iran when I was one and moved around from country to country. As an iranian, I know the endgame is having kids, and what I'm telling you right now is, do not blindly follow that.\n\nI'm an only child and never experienced a community, and never been around \"my people\" and have always been locked in my house (that changed after I became 20) Please make sure you get through this and do NOT have a kid just because it's tradition. You must look at the consequences fully before creating a life into this world.\n\nI know this became irrelevant to your post, but the moment you said you were Iranian and around my age, I couldn't help but share.",
            "Remember this when you see other men being emotional, and support them.  Best wishes in your emigration.",
            "Welp. Let's just say I'm glad you're getting out, bud. I have no idea where you're headed but I hope it's somewhere that is more progressive. Men have feelings, men cry, laugh, smile, get nervous, all humans do, and your ex boss is a garbage human being.\n\nGood luck with your journey!",
            "Rough country, love and job! Sending good vibes and luck!",
            "Effectively you're getting out of there with a clean slate.\n\nHopefully you'll be able to spread your wings and make a new life for yourself.\n\nYou're at a crossroads where you can think you've made a huge mistake or have a great opportunity.\nThe trick is staying positive, do that and you'll be ok.",
            "Tough break for real man, sorry to hear that. I hope you bounce back and have greater success than you ever thought possible \n\nWomen need a man who is emotionally accessible. Not to say they need a weakling, but they need someone who can at least connect with them in a genuine way. Don\u2019t lose that. Brick walls keep everyone out, including people you love",
            "Honestly man you're absolutely correct here. Fuck the company and fuck the country if it fosters such toxic opinions. I hope you enjoy your upcoming new life.",

            "Dude, that sucks. Thank goodness you didn't move out of the country with her, only to get dumped somewhere where you don't have a support system in place. \n\nI'm almost twice your age and I am still affected by break ups the same way. Real men cry, bro.\n\nI was single for six years, and I didn't let it get me down. It was occasionally lonely, but I got through it. I am in a decent relationship now, and you will find the right Mrs. Wooolllyyy in due time.\n\nBest wishes!",

I hope you have good luck meeting new people and getting set up, it can be one the easiest ways to get distracted away from past tragedies and improving your mental health. \n\nOf course there is also the risk of feeling even more isolated and alone in a strange new place, but definitely try to stay social and get to know as many people as possible",

            "Yeah if an immediate supervisor is going to fire you over displaying legitimate emotion after asking you about it? The only winner here is you. It sucks that you got dumped but I bet you you find better because you sound like a thoughtful individual and you'll now just be the one that got away to that one person forever. \n\nYou did not f up.",

When I lost my love, that's all I did was cry and cry. man or not, crying is natural for everyone. I  hope one day you find success and have a beautiful girlfriend and a amazing job that do not fire you for emotional pain. If her leaving was better for her then its better for you. Hang in there.

I live in the US and while I am experiencing massive hardship right now (homeless, working 7 days a week,, 10-12 hour days)  I can't imagine the difficulty that must exist in Iran. \n\nI am old(er) & I remember when seeing pics as a kid of Iran and Iranian citizens in the 1970s, before the revolution. It's unbelievable, how, much things an, change in a relatively short time. \n\nAs much as I worry about tomorrow, and as much as I wonder how I will keep my head above water, I never have to worry about some of the serious issues, hardships, and roadblocks that women, and even men, can face in Iran, and other countries.\n\nYour post speaks of so much - love, fear, professional life, Covid, etc, which reminds me that, as people, we are so much more similar than we are different. \n\nYour post led me to feel graditude I haven't felt in a while, and compassion - for you and others who hurt, lose jobs, lose respect, and lose relationships..\n\nMuch respect to you,, sir",

I attempted to patch things up with her, but it just felt unfair to myself, and you know what, just 2 months later I got talking to another girl and I am infinitely happier than I was before and that was nearly 3 years ago already. TL;DR - it may feel crap at the time but you never know what is waiting for you around the corner. \n\nAs for the boss/job, I can\u2019t imagine firing someone for crying.

            "Did you at least kick him in the balls?",
            "Your boss lacked a fundamental understanding of how humans work. Every human being experiences emotions, period. Gender is irrelevant. Even individuals with \u201csociopathy\u201d still feel emotions, as only their ability to experience guilt/shame and empathy are affected. Emotions have been essential to our survival as a species, and to fault you for having them is absolutely ridiculous.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry you experienced such shitty treatment at the hands of your former employer - if it\u2019s any consolation though, it sounds like he would have been terrible to work for anyways. \n\nMost societies today are affected by \u201cgender norms\u201d to varying degrees, and \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d is one of many harmful beliefs/attitudes that stems from them. The idea that \u201creal\u201d men are stoic, emotionless beings who only experience anger and happiness in victory, again, stands in direct contradiction to our very DNA. This expectation only forces men to suppress their emotions, which they may internalize as feelings of inadequacy, self-hatred, and self-destructive behaviour, or they may externalize these emotions by acting out/taking them out on those around them. \n\nThese stereotypes inhibit men from developing healthy coping mechanisms to deal with strong emotions that they inevitably experience, and further prevent them from accepting and examining their feelings, and learning the nuances of what they mean, and how to accurately express/communicate these emotions to other people - which is an essential life skill for individual well-being, and the development of healthy relationships with others. \n\nMy point is, there is absolutely nothing wrong with you feeling expressing your emotions; the best thing for you to do is exactly that. Let yourself grieve for the loss of your relationship and the possibilities, the hopes and dreams you had for it. This is how you process and move on from loss; not by pretending it\u2019s fine, or that you don\u2019t care. A truly strong man (or person in general) isn\u2019t afraid or ashamed of their emotions; they accept them, and learn to engage and respond to them in a positive way for the betterment of themselves and others around them.",

        "selftext": "My girlfriend and I (both female) are quite experimental in the bedroom department and we are familiar with normal dildos, never had an issue figuring out how to use them. It is straightforward and simple with a normal strap on. Well, we started speculating on buying one of these \u201cejaculating\u201d dildos a couple of months ago and I decided to bite the bullet for Christmas and get her a kinky Christmas surprise - for opening in private of course. I also got this cum-like lube which looks surprisingly realistic. \n\nSo we open it up and obviously want to get right down to it on Christmas Day but due to family commitments we have to put it aside, crack on with the day and we vow to get down to experimenting with it tomorrow night when we have some proper alone time which was Boxing Day evening. \n\nBoxing Day evening rolls around and we\u2019ve both been pretty horny during the day. The anticipation has grown and as soon as evening chill time hits we proceed to the chill part of Netflix & Chill.\n\nWe\u2019re getting down to it on the sofa and the time comes to get out our new ejaculating dildo. We\u2019re both pretty excited as the fantasy has been building for a while. I\u2019m bisexual so I obviously still like the feel of a penis and a load of cum in me or on me, and she\u2019s dominant in the bedroom so enjoys playing that role.\n\nWe excitedly grab the box and slide the big boy out. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with what they look like they have a long thin tube attached through the middle of the dildo with a syringe type thing at the end where you load the \u201ccum\u201d in, and then you obviously press the syringe down when you want it to \u201cejaculate\u201d out of the hole at the end of the dildo. We don\u2019t bother reading the instructions fully. We are firmly in the moment, it is dark and we want to get on with it. \n\nWe are totally new to this but figure how hard can it be!? Here is our first mistake. We need scissors to cut the tube down to size. It was really long and we could make out on the instructions in the dark that we needed to cut it down. We have the background light of the TV on but the main light off in the front room as I\u2019m paranoid that neighbours can see in through the thin curtains so I insist on the main light being off. I\u2019m butt naked on the sofa, shes butt naked and putting the strap on on, and in retrospect maybe turning the light on would have helped a lot in the situation. So we run to the kitchen, guess how much to cut the tube down and hope for the best. It ended up quite short. \n\nShe gets the dildo on, we take the top off the syringe bit which is actually quite large - in the dark - we load it up but unfortunately being amateurs with the ejaculating side of it, we fill it right up to the top of the syringe, pop the top back on and feel we are good to go.\n\nHere\u2019s where it starts to go wrong. I immediately felt when she put it in me that it was \u201ccumming\u201d in me quite violently. I\u2019m like woah, one pump and a squirt is not what I signed up for here. So I tell her to take it out because at this point I am the cream pie. I am filling up faster than town when the Boxing Day sales start. She wasn\u2019t pushing the syringe at all. She takes it out and it\u2019s literally just...... cumming. It won\u2019t stop. \n\nI turn over in a half horny, half irritated state to try and figure it out and I\u2019m nearly at eye line with the bulging, cumming dildo which then literally ejaculates all over my shoulder and the back on my sofa as I dive to the side to avoid it going in my eye. As I do this, I proceed to knock a drink all over the floor, the throws and anything else that was beside the sofa in my foot line. Great, the dildo is quite literally projectile cumming. My sofa is sticky with this stuff and I\u2019m flailing around holding the end of the dildo trying to stop it and I\u2019m like fuck it, let\u2019s just make it cum all over my tits to get it all out so we can crack on. I was exasperated at this point. \n\nWe try and aim it at my tits to make it a bit sexier in the moment, I\u2019m there with my head back like I\u2019m ready to take a decent load and it literally showers me. My entire torso, my tits, my stomach, my shoulders. It is not like a quaint little load that usually comes from a penis. There is not one area this stuff did not squirt. Once the monster had finished squirting it\u2019s endless load at me, it sounded like it was gently queefing which really helped the sexy atmosphere, as you can imagine. My girlfriend was desperately trying to clean me off a little and just ended up spreading it all over me and essentially rubbing it in. It was gross. I assume the air bubble combined with the overfilling of the syringe contributed to the \u201cdifficulties\u201d we had operating it.\n\nWe were pretty traumatized by that point. The reality was definitely not the same as the fantasy. We took it off and continued the traditional way. When we turned on the lights at the end, all I can say is it looked like an ejaculation massacre. We\u2019re going to fill it a little less next time and properly read the instructions.\n\nTL;DR - accidentally overfilled our new ejaculating penis, culminating in a cum stained massacre all over me and our front room.\n\n\n**Edit** - We really did not expect this post to blow up as it has! Truly glad that our experience has given you all some laughter!\n\nIn keeping with our tradition of naming our dildos, we have decided that Queefer Sutherland has been born. Thanks for all the love.",

Really loves cooking and shopping with her daddy. Is chatty with anyone that will talk to her and waves at literally everyone. \n\nSo of course we\u2019ve been teaching her to say every day words as well as any new ones we think she can pick up on. She\u2019s getting quite the vocabulary for being so little. \n\nAs it goes I decided to grill some chicken and have a nice garden salad for dinner with a homemade balsamic vinaigrette. I took my little angel to the store with me to grab a few things and when I picked up the balsamic vinegar, I heard a familiar question:\n\n*what\u2019s that?* \n\nI told her it was balsamic vinegar, which she pronounced \u201cba salty n-word\u201d I tried to correct her to no avail. Her decision was concrete.  \n\nMy adorable little girl is passing out n-words. I\u2019m mortified. She\u2019s loudly and proudly saying her new words.\n\nWe scurried out with no groceries/people staring and ordered pizza for dinner. She\u2019s still asking this morning when we\u2019re going to EAT ba salty n-word.\n\nTL;DR tried to teach my one year old to say \u201cbalsamic vinegar\u201d she is now saying \u201cba salty n-word\u201d with reckless abandon.\n\nEdit: her 4 year old brother is now saying it too. One guess who is staying home from pre school today.\n\nEdit2: some people are asking about how she\u2019s speaking so well at a year. She\u2019s actually 13 months old but i detest giving her age in months now that she\u2019s reached a year. \n\nShe talks constantly, asks for things, says please and thank you, knows names for specific toys and items. Asks for specific things to eat. Knows all of our names in our immediate family and grandparents. \n\nThe how is we taught her to speak along with ASL (American sign language), so before she could speak she could ask for milk, or more, or to be changed and a few other things before she was able to vocalize her needs. It\u2019s the best parenting thing we\u2019ve ever done.\n\nEdit3: I\u2019m really enjoying reading all the stories of other kids mixing up words. This post will definitely be saved as a gift for her 21st.\n\nLast edit: I\u2019m pretty sick of some people saying my daughter can\u2019t talk, and that kids don\u2019t speak until 18mo-2years. Here\u2019s a small [article](https://www.babycenter.com/404_when-can-i-start-teaching-my-baby-sign-language_1368485.bc)  with 5 sources advocating ASL for babies. It helped her develop her spoken words more easily. Don\u2019t be a dick about my kid you fucking don\u2019t know it all shitbags.",

This obviously only works if the listener has experience with small kids and that explains why, as useless extraneous information, it might grate on non-parents. But the differences between a 12 month old and a 24 month old in abilities is a world apart.  Your daughter sounds like she has exceptional (like to a ridiculous degree) verbal skills for her age. When you just said 1, I assumed closer to 2 than to 1.  \n\nIt also would have kept you from having to make this edit.

Also there was a wedding happening at the venue she specified?\nI tried calling and everything but she didn't answer. Eventually I managed to bump into her and two friends and they thoroughly convinced me that they were as confused about the wedding as I.\n\nSo we grouped up, started chatting and headed to a pub different from our original plan. \n\nNow I also want to mention that right from the start we talked about how we were going to split the bill. I was going to pay for my beer. The girls agreed to pay for the wine. One of the girls also ordered an expensive meal and said she would pay.\n\nThe music was great and the alcohol flowed. I'm not much of a drinker but I had a freaking amazing time. Nearing the end of our time there one of the girls suddenly got up and left. Now this is where I got confused, partially due to the alcohol and partially because I'm pretty trusting. The other two girls explained that they wanted to get a taxi with me back to their place to chill a bit longer before I would head home myself (again, there was no implication of sex or anything and I did not want any).\n\nSo yeah... They left me there telling me they were fetching this other friend back...\n\nI'm a student so I have no money either. If I'd tried to pay for their two bottles of wine, my beer and the meal then my card would have declined.\n\nHonestly the only things that kept me from rage was the excellent people at the restaurant who treated me with respect and allowed me to figure out how to pay. Also there was an incredible performing bassist there who offered to help me out until he saw the bill.\n\nI didn't know people were that awful. I couldn't afford it and they knew that because we had talked about my job and how I need to save and pay for my own university tuition. \n\nThe girl who I've known since I was tiny declined all calls and blocked me on WhatsApp. I'm so glad that my father is close with her family because I'm needing to get that money back (my father had to come and bail me out of the situation, bless him).\n\n\nTL;DR: I trusted someone I thought was my friend and they left me at a pub with a bill that I couldn't afford",

A couple of buddies of mine (we went through grade school and high school together) came to the town where I was going to college, and looked me up to hang out.  We hit a local pub, got some drinks, burgers and fries. While I was in the restroom, they took off and left me with the bill.  I knew the bartender, fortunately, and explained what happened.  He called the police on them, and I gave the police their names, last known home addresses, as well as the make, model, and license plate of the car(had to have this information for the guest parking at the apartment complex).  I guess they thought I wouldn't rat them out.  They were found at another bar by the police, trying to dine/drink and dash there, too.  Their parents bailed them out, and charges were eventually dropped as their parents paid triple for the bills at the pub and bar.",

Brother does a runner, straight into house, I'm left to pay the fair, told our mum the next day and she made him pay me back. 17 years later and he still hasn't changed.

Never mentioned anything about dating or even tried to make a move just out of respect. \n\nOne night as I\u2019m sitting down folding clothes she asked me to come out with her and a few of her girl friends. I jokingly referenced a futurama quote \u201cbut I\u2019m already in my pajamas\u201d and she blows up at me. Telling me how stupid I am because gorgeous women,  including herself were throwing themselves at me to take them out while I was probably jerking myself off. \n\nAgain\u2026.

When did you become friends with the other 2 women? If it was that night then why would that be telling on them? She blocked you , not your GF, have your girlfriend show you your old 'friend' list of friends, and then call THEM out on social media.  also, if the bar sees this all the time. then they should have called the cops, or your dad should have demanded them too once he got to the bar to pick you up.",

            "As someone who was told I was the father of a child that I was not, and she knew I was not, I have the opinion that a paternity test should be automatically given at the time of birth if the mother wants the man's name placed on the birth certificate as the father.

Let\u2019s see where our would-be author went wrong!\n\nWife/baby momma: is ok with getting a paternity test, waits weeks for results, then leaves day of test results.  Does this make sense from the characters POV?  Why would they wait around then leave? For dramatic effect?  Not very believable.  If they were going to leave then they would have done it sooner.  Think of Bane: \u201cmaybe he\u2019s wondering why someone would shoot a man before throwing him out of an airplane.\u201d Bane understood that the actions taken by others were illogical and probably fictitious.\n\nBonus round: it\u2019s incredibly convenient plot points that 1) baby momma opened the paternity letter while OP was at work and 2) got EVERYTHING packed to leave before OP got home.  While taking care of a newborn.  Alone. 3) placed the letter oh so dramatically where OP will find it with, GASP, divorce papers! How shocking and dramatic! And just wildly convenient timing that the divorce paperwork would be done and ready for signatures THE DAY the test results came back.  Cue \u201cover my head\u201d by the Fray, fade to black as we focus on OP\u2019s face, annnnd scene.  \n\nKeep trying OP.  You didn\u2019t write a bad story - it\u2019s just a bit trite.

Redditors have no idea whether OP asked tactfully.  \n4.1 Redditors think the question/request itself was accusation of adultery.  \n4.2 Redditors think OP should burn.  \n4.3 Redditors question whether any man has ground for any concern.\n5. Wife feels trust is a *sine qua non.*\n\nI'll add:\n\nWife may be hurt and feel misunderstood.  I've heard stories of spouses using threat of divorce as a bargaining chip (not trying to normalize that).\n\nThe only thing I would *personally* do is show empathy.  At minimum, explain you know how that made wife feel and why her reaction is valid (note: wife is refusing communication).  Explain what you could have done instead.  And explain you're desiring to talk but want her to have whatever space and answers she needs.\n\nThe issue is not an action (e.g. cheating or abuse or putting toilet paper on spinner as a mullet); it's a feeling she has right now.",

In practice, this theory falls apart.\n\nAnyway I came back to work today, and I\u2019ve been having diarrhea these past few days, so I took a shit right as I got to work before I clocked in. Some time passes, I take my break, I come back from break and I got that feeling in your stomach like \u201coh yeah I\u2019m gonna have to shit soon.\u201d So, I figured what I was feeling was a fart, so I just yk, let it go.\n\nMy god. There, in the middle of the warehouse, a small amount of diarrheal shit escaped my ass. I quickly ran to the bathroom, and discovered I was dealing with a large pool of fecal matter.\n\nI was pissed, sad, and just ready to be done with this stupid fucking shift. But, I couldn\u2019t work the rest of the shift like this, so I took one hour of my personal time off, and headed home to change.\n\nBefore I went home, however, I had to talk to my manager to let her know I less leaving for a bit but that I\u2019d be back. Naturally she asked why, and as I tried to make up some excuse, a worker from behind me obviously noticed the shit stain on my jeans.\n\nWhat happened next will haunt me for the rest of my life. I don\u2019t know who, but I heard someone shout \u201cYO HE SHIT HIMSELF.\u201d \n\nNever been so embarrassed in my life. Everyone laughed, and I submitted my resignation a few minutes ago.\n\nTL;DR: I shit myself at work to avoid getting fired, ended up resigning after everyone saw.\n\nEdit: Thank you to everyone who commented! I\u2019m trying to read them all but I\u2019m having trouble keeping up! There are so many! You\u2019ve all made me laugh so I thank you!\n\nI\u2019m also taking y\u2019all\u2019s advice, I will be seeing if I can rescind my resignation, or at least be able to reapply as soon as possible. :)\n\nEdit 2: thanks for the gold!!",

There was literally nothing I could do and if I didn't get a warning from my stomach beforehand, I was shit outta luck and peeing out my butt whether I was ready or not. This just happened to be one of those times..\n\nI felt the pressure, tried to clench and still seeped shit to my pants. Quickly ran to the bathroom and realize there was no saving myself this time....so I took my undies off, balled them up and rolled them into a TON of toilet paper and tossed to the bottom of a big trash can. I worked commando for another 2 hours bc we were Hella busy before taking my lunch first with an excuse of \"lady problems\" and rushed home.

At one point he asked me, \"so if I give you criticism or instruction on a task you'll just ignore me?\" To which I responded emphatically, \"yes\", then walked off. \n\nThey still didn't fire me.\n\nBy this time I was already 25 hours negative on my UPT. I was one of the top three water spiders at the warehouse I worked at regardless of shift, and I basically was impossible to \"coach\" by the time I left because I understood very well how the place worked and it's honestly not that complicated because they make each job about as simple as possible so that any idiot or robot could do it.\n\nI eventually rage quit.

        "selftext": "Before everyone freaks out - yes, I am on birth control. Also, apologies on format because of mobile blah blah.\n\nThis happened 30 minutes ago. I'm currently sitting in my car outside my gynecologist's office typing this.\n\nMy boyfriend and I both lead pretty busy lives. He works full time and often works overnight shifts. On the other hand, I'm a full time student that works 30-35 hours a week. On top of that, I had to put down my beloved fur child last Saturday, so as expected, he hasn't really been putting his wand in my Chamber of Secrets..if you catch my drift.\n\nAfter an emotionally draining week, filled with lots tears and interspersed with sexual frustration, we finally had some time last night to, in Conan O'Brien's words, \"take grandma to Applebee's.\" It's been a while since we had sex and my bf is not a fan of hand to gland combat, so unsurprisingly, he had a huge load.. As in, I felt his dick spasms as he shot ropes of jizz in me. When I was cleaning myself up after, I noticed just how much was coming out of me and when I told him he laughs it off and says,\" Haha, yeah, that was a lot.\"\n\nAnyways, this morning I check my calendar and of course I have a gyno appointment. I'm the type of person that gets really anxious for any type of appointment and while psyching myself out for my handsome and young male gyno to take a peek at my vagooba, I completely forget about last nights sexscapade. \n\nFast forward to the appointment and everything seems normal. I guess my gyno was training a Physician's Assistant because she was the one that did my pap smear. \n\nFor the dudes reading this, a pap smear is when us ladies have to channel our inner Sasha Grey and lay on our backs with our legs spread wide open for our gynecologists' viewing pleasure. They then stick a speculum in, open up our love canals, and blindly stick a bristle-like swab in to take cultures. Ya know, nothing's better than having a complete stranger stick random objects up your terrified vag while they try to hold a conversation with you - always a good time.\n\nAnyways, as she sticks the speculum in, her soft virgin eyes look mortified. My experienced gyno just carries on, asking me questions (keep in mind that he was not behind her but was to my left). Midway he stops, walks over to take a quick look, smirks, and goes,\" Do you finally have a bf?\" (It's worth noting that he's a really cool gyno and obviously, I must talk to him about my sex life every check up; at this point, I wasn't sure if he had actually seen the semen inside me or was just making small talk). I awkwardly answer \"yes\" and he gives me his spiel about continuing my birth control/being careful. The new PA still looks semi-disgusted but has finished and is now pulling out the speculum. That's the EXACT moment that my soul leaves my body. As she pulls it out to throw in the trash behind her, I see my boyfriend's freaking baby batter DRIPPING off this thing into the floor. Once the speculum was removed, I proceed to feel a gush of liquid rush out of my pink canoe and pool around my butt. Yes, I was still spread eagle and you can bet that they both saw. \n\nThe poor PA looks at my gyno and asks,\" Did you want me to clean that?,\" referring to what dripped on the floor. Before he could answer, I made a strange ass sound and rushed out,\" It's okay, I'll do it.\"\n\nBefore they leave, my gynecologist winks at me and says,\" Guess your dry spell is finally over!\" We speak casually like friends so I'm not weirded out or anything but so embarrassed.\n\nGuys.. I am seriously fucking horrified. What the fuck. I'm seriously considering switching gyno's but mine is so damn good at his job and we really get along. \n\nAlso, not using a throwaway because I have no shame.\n\nTL;DR: Boyfriend blew a huge load in me last night, went to the gynecologist today, and his cum literally gushes out of me.\n\nEDIT: For those of you suggesting that this is an April Fools joke.. it is unfortunately not. My dignity is in shambles but I\u2019m glad a few of you were able to laugh, cry, and cringe with me.\n\nAlso, yes, I did shower. My after-sex routine always involves a shower where I proceed to push my pelvic floor muscles like I am a reborn Christian, trying to expel the demon spawn that my sinful boyfriend had pushed into me. Although a hefty amount DID come out last night, apparently, not all of it. Contrary to popular belief, cooter\u2019s are not wide, gaping holes, with lips that flap whenever there's a breeze. Washing the outside of your vagina does not clean the INSIDE which, if you're not dipping your 'nana into the Nutella jar, is where the semen goes. A pap smear looks at the inside of the vagina and a speculum is an instrument that basically spreads open the walls of your tight vagina so the gynecologist can get a better look at your cervix.\n\nIn my case, just like ~~Noah~~ Moses, that speculum split the waves and onto the path that was just formed, onward gushed my beloved boyfriend's high fructose porn syrup. \n\nEDIT 2: For those that don't believe this is true.. or that I am female (grrls don't use the the interwebz hurrhurr), here are the screenshots of me talking to my boyfriend after. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/TwRHKGz\n\nEDIT 3: For those that STILL don't believe me:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/yMZJvJK\n\nAlso, please don't speak badly about my gynecologist. You may think it's unprofessional but I've been seeing him for years now (prior to my bf, I was single for 3 years and I'm not one to partake in one night stands) and we're really close. As part of a regular check up for STD screening, he always asked if I have engaged in any sexual activity and for three years, I'd say no then tell him how much I longed for a relationship. If this happened in one of our first appointments, he would have NEVER acted like this. I have PCOS/am high risk for cervical cancer so I am constantly there for testing, ultrasounds, and general check ups regarding birth control/Metformin/etc. (we're still working on a method to regulate my period). He's become really close to me and we always joke around because it eases my nerves. It took us a while to get as comfortable as we are with each other and I wouldn't change it for the world. Though it'll always be nerve wracking to see any kind of physician ESPECIALLY a gynecologist, for me, it really helps that I view him as a friend. \n\nTo clarify, bf and I had sex around 3am last night, I cleaned up, then we went to bed. Today (or I guess yesterday since it's 12:33am right now), was my day off so I legitimately woke up and Netflixed in bed all day until around 1 pm since my appointment was at 2.\n\nBelieve me or not, that's up to you. All I'm saying is I swear on my beloved fur baby's soul that it happened and I am still super embarrassed. In the years that I've been his patient, I have never seen this young female PA before. I do not know if this was the first time she encountered a situation like this but from the look on her face, I can only guess. I'm sure she'll become seasoned in time and things like this wil not phase her. The PA gave me my pap smear and I had to come back in a week to get an ultrasound for my PCOS anyway so if results were unclear due to semen, I'm sure we will redo the pap smear. My appointment was at 2pm but I was not seen until 3pm due to him having an emergency regarding a patient to attend to at the hospital so the exam was very rushed since he had a full waiting room. However, I'll be sure not to have PiV sex for at least 48 hours prior (very thankful for this advice as I genuinely did not know and this was my first visit where I am in a relationship ever).\n\nI honestly was NOT expecting this to blow up like this in anyway.. I never even really post on Reddit, hence not using a throwaway since nobody knows I have this account *shrugs*. I guess this will become my \"throwaway\" account now since all this attention is making me a bit uncomfortable.\n\nSome of you are criticizing my writing style and that's okay. I decided to have some fun with this post since it honestly was an awkward situation. I also happen to be a fan of euphemisms and personally challenged myself to use as many as I could. Sorry to those that felt it was hard to read or cringey and thanks to those that light heartedly laughed with me. I appreciate all of you - both the bad and good comments.\n\nIt was nice feeling semi-popular for one day, as things have been pretty gloomy around here ever since my dog died but some of your comments have really brightened my day. \n\nGoodnight Reddit!",

I've submitted over 100 applications for engineering jobs around the country and I have not had much feedback.

This is what it reads: \"Intellectual Disability (formerly described as mental retardation)\". I feel sick to my stomach knowing that I've been applying for jobs that I really want and I have unknowingly classified myself as mentally retarded. I don't deserve these jobs for being so dumb and fucking up all these applications.\n\n\nTLDR: I've been checking the \"Intellectual Disability\" in applications to declare ADHD when that actual means mental retardation.

And some will who do mean to discriminate and just think \"hey, it's my company, it's my money, I want all my workers top notch and normal\".\n\nIt's not like jobs will give you much leeway because of something like that. Employers expect you to be able to sit down for 40 hours a week and get your shit done no matter what conditions you have, and they don't want someone who will be difficult to work with sometimes. There will be people who get the wrong idea with your ADHD and think it means you won't be productive. Even if it's illegal, employers will discriminate.\n\nWatch out for yourself and give yourself the best chance you got at a job. If someone does end up discriminating, sue their ass. But maybe people should keep conditions like that to themselves because there's nothing enforcing that you will be considered equally among other applicants. There's no way to know that they hired someone less qualified because they were scared that you ticked a checkbox. Even if these days it's a lot easier for people to talk about ADHD, OCD, autism, and all sorts of spectrums where people are productive and functional but have a condition, there are still a lot of people who are weird about it and will even talk shit about a family member because they take anti-depressants.",

I browse the shelves a bit and up buying a bento meal, mentos, and a diet coke. Checking out goes fine since I don\u2019t really need to communicate, just hand over money. So as I walk back to my hotel in the middle of a crowded sidewalk my dumbass decided to pop a few mentos in my mouth just because. So I suck on those for a while and than without even thinking about the consequences I take a HUGE swig of diet coke, like so big that i can\u2019t swallow all of it and it\u2019s just sitting in my mouth. Than all of a sudden so feel a very weird foaming in my mouth. Than it hits me. I remember the experiments I did in elementary school, the crazy russian hacker vids, etc. That was the very moment I knew I fucked up. So before I can think literally anything else it\u2019s foaming out of my mouth and I choke a little and end up just spewing out this diet coke foam. So obviously the people around me notice and come up to me and start speaking japanese. And of course I am sitting there, completely clueless. They were probably asking me if I needed help? I am dying of sheer embarrassment so I deadass just bolt back to my hotel with foam dripping down my face and clothes, im feeling sticky everywhere and life is not good. Once I get back to my hotel room and start to settle in I remember that I left my actual food on the sidewalk. So I just ended up starving until my dad came home and brought some leftovers. \n\nTL;DR: I mixed mentos and diet coke into my mouth in front of a bunch of people who didn\u2019t speak the same language as me and sheer embarrassment ensued.",

            "I did something similar on an airplane once - I usually got Diet Coke, and Mentos just sounded like a good idea at the time. I generally take my time with the soda, though, and I didn't put them both in my mouth at the same time. I did feel a little extra fizziness a couple of times, but that's it.\n\nUntil the burps started.\n\nI had no clue why I was burping so much at first, but I eventually put two and two together. Personally, I thought it was hilarious - it was a bit uncomfortable, but that combo's not gonna kill ya. Not sure what the other passengers thought of the extra minty air.",

        "selftext": "Obligatory \"this was two years ago\". My daughter was 4 at the time.\n\nMy daughter's love of Bob Ross started in the womb. I had terrible insomnia throughout my pregnancy, and I would listen to Bob Ross painting tutorials each night to fall asleep. (At the time I thought it helped me sleep because it was essentially soothing background noise, but recently I've learned about ASMR and I realize that I am super susceptible to certain sounds, such as quiet calm voices, and the scratching of paint brushes and tools). Anyways, after my daughter was born, I continued to have a hard time sleeping-- this time because of a crying and demanding baby. So every night, I'd lay down in my bed with her next to me in the bassinet, and I'd play Bob Ross. As my daughter got older, she began to demand Bob Ross. We'd read a board book or two before bed, and then we'd watch one half hour tutorial. By the end of these videos, my daughter (and often myself) would be sound asleep. For years this routine has continued. It continued through my second pregnancy, and now with my second daughter as well. We watch Bob Ross EVERY. SINGLE. NIGHT. We've seen each and every Joy of Painting tutorial (all 403 episodes) multiple times.\n\nSome nights I might think my kids have fallen asleep during book time (we are past board books and onto chapter books now). But when I close the book and prepare to sneak out of their room inevitably one or both of them chirps up: \"Mama, what about Bob Ross?\" And so we watch Bob Ross.\n\nWhich brings me to the fateful day. After watching a particularly compelling episode of the Joy of Painting, my four year old sighed happily and said \"Mama, one day I'd like to go visit Bob Ross. Where does he live again?\" To which I replied \"Muncie, Indiana remember?\" \"Oh yes\" she said, recalling that Bob mentions Muncie frequently. And then....and to this day I still don't entirely know why...I said these words: \"But honey, I have to tell you something. Bob Ross died a long time ago. We might be able to visit Muncie, but won't be able to meet Bob\".\n\nAnd my daughter broke down completely.\n\nNow, like most parents, I've seen my kids cry. I've seen ALL their cries: when they are angry, hungry, scared, bored, whining, manipulating, you name it. But I had never heard her cry like this. She was completely and utterly bereft. She was wailing and punching herself in the chest and thighs while giant strangled sobs burst from her lungs. The news that her hero was dead just destroyed her.\n\nShe cried for a solid 20 minutes. My husband (helpfully) shouted up from the main floor of the house \"What the hell made you think that would be a good idea? Seriously, what possessed you to tell her that?\" And I couldn't really answer except that I had felt in that moment that I shouldn't lie to her. That I should tell her the truth about Bob Ross and that he wasn't alive anymore.\n\nAfter she stopped crying we talked a lot about Bob Ross, how he died, and about his legacy. I told her about how Bob Ross gave a very important gift to the world, and that his own love of painting had inspired so many artists and people in every country. Even as a four year old with limited understanding of life and death, she seemed to find some solace in that. 1.5 years later she still brings up how Bob Ross made a lot of people happy, and how he makes her happy still.\n\nSo that's my TIFU. My lovely 5.5 and 3 year old daughters will surely be demanding \"Bob Ross\" tonight, and as always I will oblige them.\n\nTL;DR: My young daughter loves Bob Ross. I told her that he was dead.\n\nEDIT:\n\nOh my goodness, this blew up.  I checked in right before I put my kids to bed and my eldest and I sat up and read some of the comments together. She particularly loved the Bob Ross Lego figurine someone shared (she is a big Lego fan) and thought one user's story about their Mom becoming a professional painter after watching Bob Ross tutorials was \"really nice\".\n\nI also read the post itself to my daughter, and she smiled and chuckled along. When it got to the part where her Dad questioned my general parenting abilities she stopped to ask me \"why would Dad say that to you?\" and when I replied \"well, he thought I should've protected your feelings\" she said rather matter-of-factly \"You shouldn't lie to children\". So I guess she agrees with my approach(?)\n\nSeveral people asked where you can find all the Bob Ross episodes, and the answer is Youtube! Check out the [Bob Ross channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxcnsr1R5Ge_fbTu5ajt8DQ).  Tonight my girls and I watched this [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoJ2tcXWb7g)).\n\nAnd finally to answer the question of  \"did I know that it was the 25th anniversary of Bob Ross' death today?\" No, I did not. That's honestly blowing my mind a little bit, because I've been thinking about making this TIFU post for a few weeks, and it just so happens I finally sat down today and wrote it up.  I couldn't remember the exact year he died until I looked it up on his Wiki entry today, and I totally glossed over the specific date. July 4th. What a weird weird coincidence.\n\nSecond update: Holy smokes. Almost 26,000 upvotes? I\u2019m so pleased my FU resonated with so many. Thanks to the folks who gave me flair and gold; I\u2019ve never made a post on Reddit that attracted much attention, haha. \n\nI seriously enjoyed all the funny, heartbreaking and relatable stories of the first time you experienced your own loss of a hero\u2014 Elvis, Michael Jackson, members of the Beatles, MLK, Mr. Rogers....thank you for your comments and I\u2019ll continue to read them all.\n\nAnd finally thanks to everyone who shared their own stories of Bob Ross and the influence he had on their lives. It\u2019s awesome that he continues to inspire so many people with his art tutorials, love of animals and nature, life advice and kindness 25 years after his death. The world is truly a better place because of him.\n\nIf anyone is looking for a good watch, [The Happy Painter](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MCwGOMloBPk) is on YouTube as is this gem [Where Are All the Bob Ross Paintings?](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rDs3o1uLEdU)",

            "My mom, who is in her 60s, learned to paint from Bob Ross.  She became a successful artist and art teacher as a result.  All four of her children (me included) grew up with a love of art.  My brother and I went to an Arts based High School because of her passion for the arts.  My children have inherited a love of the Arts thanks to Bob Ross.  I mourn for his loss just as you and your children do.  But he has enriched generations of children with his soft spoken words and soft brush stokes.  I don\u2019t think of this as a TIFU - but a learning experience.

It made it something that was okay to talk about and accept.",

My mom would also keep me busy with TV when I was growing up, and one of my absolute favourite movies was Dragonheart. I had watched it already when it would be aired on some TV channel, and this particular summer afternoon it got aired again. \n(Spoiler alert!) I don't remember how the conversation went, but my mom had to break to me the terrible news that the dragon DIED at the end of the movie, and I just lost it. I sort of remember the feeling, and it's utter impotence, fear, and realisation of the bigger forces of the universe that are going to be toying with you for the rest of your life.

She will see this, she will see he can no longer contribute, but she will come to understand that his body of work and his attitude were iconic and much needed in this world. She couldn't have a better role model to chase for, and hopefully it puts the idea in her head early that she can be the master of her legacy and build anything she wants to create.\n\nI personally can't wait for the day I am given the opportunity for such an important life lesson.

She always had a room full of toys and the newest Disney movie we couldn't afford in her play room. When the farm cats had kittens, she called all of us who cared to come see them. She always snuck us the hose past Grandpa so we could have a moat in our sand castle, but if you talked back or left a mess, she would come at you in her wheelchair, so we learned how to jump up on the furniture pretty quickly.\nOn her literal deathbed, she dictated what every grand and greatgrandkid was to get for Christmas and birthdays the next year.\nShe made me feel special and unique, and not so much like a weirdo (I'm awesome now, but the smart/nerd culture was so not cool in the late 80's).

        "selftext": "Hey r/tifu, I wanted to share this experience because I'm still riding high on the no pain drug :) hope this can convince someone else to go to the fucking Dr if they need to. \n\nI guess the FU was actually over two years ago. I had just quit my job on a whim and decided to move to NYC. Money was tight and I was living with my parents until I could find work and a place to live. \n\nI was chilling on the couch eating popcorn when I bit down on something hard. The pain was excruciating and what I though might be a popcorn kernel ended up being a large chunk of my second molar. \n\nWith no health Insurance of any kind, I was terrified of what the bill was going to be. but the pain was so bad I sucked it up and went to my dentist. The dentist drilled away and put a temp cap on what used to be a tooth. Before I left he told me \" that was a deep cavity, if it still hurts in a week you will need a root canal\". \n\nThe pain from breaking the tooth was so bad it was a relief to have the cap on. But I noticed quickly that I could not drink anything cold on the side of my mouth. I figured this was just due to how deep the filling went. I started tilting my head to drink cold water.  Then my GF started telling me I was eating in my sleep. After a few weeks she became concerned. \"You are slamming your teeth together and grinding the shit out of them at night\" she said. I bought a mouth guard. A few months In and I started to wake up with headaches. Looking back, these all should have been signs of how much pain I was in. \n\n1 yr later: I have great health insurance but I'm not really In noticable pain. It's annoying that I can't drink cold water on that side and that I wake up with headaches every morning but... W.e I deal with it. I can tell one side of my mouth feel different but again I write it off and just chew on the other side when needed. \n\nFast forward to the global pandemic: I start waking up with shooting pain so unbearable that I can't get back to sleep for hours. After a few weeks of little to no sleep FINALLY it's time to go to the dentist. My dentist is a pro, he looks me over taps on my teeth with some metal thing and says \" time for that root canal bud\".\n\n It happened fast, my primary dentist sends me over to the oral surgeon right from his office. But, the oral surgeon can't figure out what is going on. He has some sort of liquid nitrogen tool that he is spraying onto my teeth and telling me to raise my hand when it hurts. But I'm not raising my hand. He's getting pretty upset and saying \"OP, this is no time to be brave. this much cold should be excruciating even on a healthy tooth\". It's feels strange i tell him. Annoyed and confused the Dr leaves to go call my primary. When he comes back he says: I trust primary, if he says you need a root canal then that's what we will do. \n\nThe whole process was super easy, don't let anyone tell you root canals hurt. It was honestly easier than getting a cavity filled.  It was done in 40 min and I felt NOTHING. The surgeon told me to expect pain for a few days also some jaw soreness. But, the weird thing is: I felt AMAZING. I hadn't even realized how much pain I was in over the past two years. Compared to that pain, the soreness from the procedure felt great. Right after the novacane wore off I felt incredibly strange and clear headed for the first time I could remember. I was less irritable and I wasn't clenching my jaw like I usually do. \n\nLooking back, I couldn't feel the cold test because my nerves were already maxed out on pain and had been for a long time. Waking up the morning after, I feel like a whole new person. I can't believe I was able to ignore that level of pain for that long but it feels like a drug not to have it. I haven't taken any pain meds for my tooth because it feels so great just to have a tiny bit of soreness around the tooth now. I spent 10 min this morning just swishing ice cold water back and forth in my mouth in amazement. \n\n\nTldr; I convinced myself a large amount of dental pain was normal as it got worse and worse over two years. When I finally did something about it l, it got better instantly.\n\n\nEdit: I went to an endodontist. Some have pointed out that oral surgeon is a specific study and not a broader term like I thought it was.",

            "Dentist here. Root canals ARE NOT supposed to hurt. If it still hurts, your dentist needs to put more anesthetic.

To cancel out the acidic infectious environment, you must add MORE anesthesia. \n4. Result....Numbness and no pain!",

Right after the novacane wore off I felt incredibly strange and clear headed for the first time I could remember.\n\nI understand this 100%. I had a back surgery after I had a nerve so compressed that I was passing out from the pain - but the funny thing was, I had dealt with the pain so long because of doctors who wouldn't do a damn thing, that I pretty much didn't feel it anymore. The first time I passed out, I thought I was in barely any pain at all - I was pouring sweat and getting more and more light headed, but couldn't understand why my body was just giving up on me when it felt like one of my less painful days.\n\nWaking up from surgery was like I had unloaded a burden I forgot I was carrying.",
            "At least you went to the dentist. I was living on $6/hr in an upstate ny ghetto when my wisdom tooth started crumbling. The three days it took the nerve to die were the most excruciating days of my life. Clove oil was my only temporarly relief, though on night 2 I drank a fuckton if absinthe and tried to pull it myself- note the needlenosed pliers which were the only tool I had on hand could not get a grip on it. Not to mention the week before I had spilled boiling hot water on my foot trying to drain microwaved pierogis, giving me a second degree burn. Christ I didn't get to a dentist until 6 years later and he pulled that shit out 123. Tooth pain was worse than the burn. I still delieved pizza during all that because I needed to make my $500 rent but goddamn. 5/7 would not recommend being American.",

            "I don't remember writing this, that's strange... It wasn't while eating pop-corn, it was with bacon, it didn't hurt when the tooth broke (yeah, the nerves were pretty dead at that point) and I didn't last 1 year, more like 5 months, but yeah, the rest is pretty similar, even down to the molar.

Tooth extractions, cavity fillings, braces, root canals, even a broken tooth that had an implant that needed redoing.  Other than braces I rarely felt anything.  \n\nThat wisdom tooth though.  Fine the first couple days, then day 3 I was laid out on the couch in pain for nearly 4hrs straight.  First time I caved and took Percocet ever.  I wouldn't wish dental pain on anyone.",
            "Good for you! Just got my wisdom teeth out at 40 years old because I was too afraid to do it before. It was really not that big of a deal. I didn\u2019t even get knocked out or have laughing gas. It actually took less that 10 minutes for him to yank all 4 of them.",
            "Went through almost the same experience.\n\nI had some cavities and the pain would come, last for a couple of days and then go.\n\nUntil it didn't go away, I endured 2 weeks of sleepless nights, whenever I went to bed I cried because of the pain and couldn't sleep at all. In my free days from work I couldn't do anything, I couldn't focus on anything, it was all pain.\n\nOne afternoon I said fuck it and looked up the closest dentist to me, called and scheduled an appointment ASAP. Went there 2 hours later and the dude fixed me up, I don't think I've ever been happier than at that moment when the pain went away.",
            "Experiences range, of course, but I heard that the pain often attributed to root canals is actually the pain/damage that warranted the root canal. Don't quote me on this, though, I probably read it on WebMD six years ago.",
            "Just had to have a root canal on a tooth but only put up with the pain for 2 weeks. Had to do a round of antibiotics because of the abscess as well. The two weeks of pain before I had the root canal sucked. Radiating pain in my jaw that was magnified by anything hot or cold. I can\u2019t imagine waiting any longer to get it taken care of.\n\nThe doc that did mine was an absolute pro. The actual procedure itself took only about 30 mins and they numbed me some much I didn\u2019t feel shit.",
            "A similar thing happened to me, but almost backwards and over a shorter period of time. I had a filling on my molar, then over a few weeks started to develop a terrible cold sensitivity. I should have gone immediately but I kept putting it off until my gums were swollen and clearly infected - that got my attention. Went to the dentist, they dug out the filling and said \"uhhhh we can't do this we'll probably lose the tooth\" so I got referred to an endodontist (super microscope dentist) where the root canal only took 5 minutes. They told me once things opened back up again I would need to schedule a crown (this all happened in April).  \n\nOne week later part of the remaining molar fell off while I was flossing, but I was literally in the process of moving to another state so couldn't commit to the multiple visits and weeks of delays between temp crown and full install. I still haven't gotten a new dentist in my new state so I've been dealing with this weird hole.  \n\nI will say...my fear of dentists is basically gone, the super specialized numbing drugs, and all the other technology they have now is just amazing.  \n\nI hope you continue to take care of your teeth and congrats on becoming pain free!!",

Thus you get some pain followed by the anesthetic effect.\n\nThis makes me wonder if your nerves in the area were already so overwhelmed that it was effectively like a 24x7 anesthetic?

            "It\u2019s so easy to ignore a pain once you\u2019ve put up with it for so long especially if you don\u2019t realize how much of a problem it actually is! (This is a dental story i promise!) Coming up on two years ago I started having some major sleeping struggles. I would be absolutely exhausted every single day regardless of how much sleep I would get. So, I decided to go to the sleep doctor to have it looked at and they told me I had parasomnia and tried putting me on sleeping meds. It helped but I\u2019d still have problems and I hate being reliant on medication. So I didn\u2019t really stop there because I\u2019m a strong believer that most of the time there\u2019s a more natural solution rather than medications. Well, for years I have had some jaw issues. It wasn\u2019t bad and it wasn\u2019t something that I thought really needed to be looked into because I didn\u2019t know it wasn\u2019t normal, but my jaw started to have this ache in it (like i was clenching my jaw without realizing it all day every day and grinding my teeth heavily at night so my jaw was exhausted) and over the course of the last 2 years it\u2019s gotten worse until a little over a month ago I decided to have it looked at. My dentist took a look and made a guess that my jaw needed to be \u2018 re programmed\u2019 to close where it naturally should. She gave me this little thing to put in my mouth to help realign my bite temporarily and within 1 day the aches were gone and I was getting real quality sleep again! I now have to get braces to properly align my jaw as it will fall back into its old place that was causing me pain if I don\u2019t.\n\nLong story short, I spent a lot of time and money on a sleep doctor when all I needed to do was get my teeth looked at to fix my sleeping problems. Who knew that your mouth had that much of an impact on your sleep!",

Finally found a dentist who would even set an appointment. I told her in not interested in saving the tooth I just need the pain gone. Pull the damn thing out now and we will figure out something after. She said I would but I can't give you anything for pain. At this point I did not give a fuck. I said I don't care pull it. She made me sign so many papers that day \ud83d\ude02 she said I'm afraid if I pull it and it breaks more it'll be worse. I said nothing can be worse then this pull it.

I could barely hold a cup of coffee with my main arm and had an infant son at home that I could only hold with my left arm.  I couldn't hold a telephone up to my ear for a full minute, and if the phone rang while I was already holding the baby it'd just go to voicemail.  I felt isolated and in terrible pain, and the doctor I'd gone to acted like nothing was wrong because he's apparently used to severed limbs and couldn't see anything.\n\nMy teeth hurt from clenching them during the day and grinding them at night.  I bought a mouth guard.  The pain meds they gave me didn't seem to do anything but make me nervous about taking them.\n\nAfter months and months of suffering, I went to a different doctor, who found cause for the pain in what seemed like 5 minutes in his office.  I literally thought the knock on the door was to tell me that we're done and how much to pay, and instead he took me to an x-ray display and showed me things the first doc and his team had missed.  It felt like finding God.\n\nAfter physical therapy, changing my lifestyle for a few years, I've been able to slowly build back up to where I can hold my now walking and talking son in one arm and my new boy in the other.

            "The OP's comment about the impact on your life of walking around in pain is so, so true. Maybe 10 years ago, I went in to my regular dentist for a root canal. No big thing, I'd had them before. Only this time, halfway through, he discovers that he doesn't have a drill long enough to get all the way to the bottom of the root of the tooth (a big ol' molar in the back), so he just packs a bunch of whatever dentists pack teeth with right on top of all that chopped-up nerve and sends me on my way while he orders the longer tool he needs to finish the job. With no pain meds. It's kinda uncomfortable but I'm going about my business. A couple of days later I swing by to see if the parts in, and I'm told not yet,  they'll call me when it is. So, I casually mention this the next day to a co-worker, who looks at me in abject horror and has me call her dentist, who sees me immediately. I then go straight from there to an endontist for an emergency root canal, which has to be done in two parts. Why was I just walking around like that? Chronic back pain from degenerative disc disease and spinal stenosis. I don't take narcotics, because I'm 29 sober at this point, so I kinda just hurt all the time. The botched root canal was just another Monday, I suppose because I'm used to a base level of discomfort.",

            "Bro. Your root canal didn\u2019t hurt because the nerve inside of your tooth inflamed and died before you got the root canal. This exact same thing happened to me, except my tooth died much faster. All that pain you were experiencing was literally the nerve ending of that tooth slowly dying. That\u2019s why you didn\u2019t feel anything. We actually have nerves inside of our teeth, and when you get a root canal they dig out a lot of that nerve and fill it up. This is why it\u2019s called a \u201croot\u201d canal, it\u2019s also why it hurts soooo damn bad. And it DOES hurt - for most people. Mine didn\u2019t hurt so bad because I also grind my teeth and broke open one of my molar teeth. I have sciatica/a herniated disc, and the pain from my tooth breaking open was the worst pain I\u2019ve ever experienced by a long shot.

There were no moments of intense pain but my wrist would constantly lock up and I\u2019d have to mess around until it clicked into place. Again I was told by the urgent care doc that I should take Advil if the pain continued. Now it\u2019s July and it still hurts so my Primary Carephysician tells me to go to a specialist, who in 10 minutes of x-rays tells me I broke my wrist and will need surgery as it looks like it\u2019s tried to heal then reveille itself quite a few times. 8 months of being told to suck it up and just take Advil and I get told my wrist is broken and need surgery, now I never ignore serious pain.",

I had a really bad cavity due to improper oral hygiene when I was around 18, 19 and always had a fear of the dentist (due to a childhood of \"traumatizing\" experiences there, like cavities and needles) . My parents didn't really listen to me when I complained about tooth pain, until one day when I was chewing gum on the side where the cavity is and then BAM! The worst instantaneous sharp pain I had never felt up until that point. So finally I was able to convince them schedule a dentist appointment for me (keep in mind, I had just graduated HS recently and was unfamiliar with being an adult, even though they wanted me to schedule the appointment myself), and I was using on my own shitty Target insurance. Well, once I found out my tooth was in need for a Root Canal I did the smart thing...put it off for 5/6 years. Yeah, as crazy as it sounds, I was rocking a temp filling all those years and was never in any  pain nor needed to get the temp replaced. I finally got a good paying job/insurance and convinced myself to go to an Endodontist and get a Root Canal. All in all, a painless experience.

Talk to your dentist and see about paying in installments if that works better for you (and if they won't help you, shop around - where I live there's 10,000 dentists).  I just spent $1753 CAD on a permanent crown, which absolutely destroyed the possibility of me doing anything cool this summer, but I don't care.  Just having it in there and being able to chew with that side and not having pain is a tremendous blessing.",

            "Gotta love how many doctors do not register that high pain threshold is a thing. When I thought my wisdom teeth were coming in, I asked my dentist to look at them, warning them I have a high pain threshold (I had realized this from...previous injuries and a different oral surgery), and that by the time it actually hurts me, it will be BAD. They basically just blew me off and told me to come back when it hurt. So...I came back when I was in pain, about a year later, and they wrote me a referral to an oral surgeon. They also found a cavity and filled it. Turns out that the pain was just the cavity. I...didn't bother to mention it when I realized the cavity was all the pain had come from. Oral surgeon went ahead with removing my wisdom teeth, at least one of which was already impacted. An impacted wisdom tooth caused me zero pain, apparently. I didn't even take the vicodin afterwards because I didn't need it. I just took the prescription ibuprofen, stopped taking that after like...three days because I no longer needed that, either, then starting taking it again a few days after that because I got a dry socket lol. They also didn't seem to believe me when I called to tell them I had a dry socket because I was able to manage the pain with just prescription ibuprofen, but the internet told me that pain was the main complication I could expect from a dry socket, anyway, so big shrug I guess. I didn't even end up using all of the ibuprofen, or needing the refill I apparently could have gotten for it.\n\nMy new dentist is better. When I asked her if she could just not bother numbing me when she fixed my cavity fillings, because I was pretty sure that they were not deep enough that it was going to actually hurt, she did that for me (with the caveat that I'd, y'know, tell her if I did end up being in pain so she could stop and numb me, which didn't end up being necessary).\n\nI think doctors just assume I'm trying to brag or something and blow me off when I literally just want to be clear that pain isn't necessarily a reliable metric for me. What am I supposed to do, lie? I guess that kind of IS what I did to get my wisdom teeth out when I did, even if it wasn't really intentional.",

The person who did my root canal said it was one of the worst he\u2019d ever seen, the tooth was under so much pressure that liquid spurted from the tooth when he tapped into it.",
            "Definitely go to the dentist if you get any tooth pain. As a child, I had a really bad cavity. My tooth pain hurt me so badly, I would cry myself to sleep from the pain.

            "Endodontist here (root canals are my trade)! The reason you weren't feeling pain to the cold test is that the pulp (where the nerve resides) had been infected for so long that the nerve fibers responsible for feeling cold had started to die off.  We call the pulp necrotic at this point. Headaches, jaw pain, earaches, and sinus pressure/pain are not uncommon with these kinds of infections and are WAAAY worse than the root canal procedure. A couple of pinches for local anesthesia and it's all downhill from there! I'm glad you were able to get the care you needed! Keep spreading the word, because root canals get such a bad rap compared to the actual experience!",
            "Dude, there was something wrong with you. \"Don't let anyone tell you root canals hurt\". My dad got one, and he was on pain pills for a few days afterwards. He's the toughest son of a bitch I know.",
            "Advice to anyone who has had a root canal: if your endodontist failed mention that your root canal can possibly go bad, later, you just need to be aware that this can happen. Your body can, and sometimes does, suddenly fail to recognize that the tooth with the root canal is still part of your body. This sets up a situation where your immune system attacks it, like it would any other foreign invader. This can manifest in two ways:\n1) localized pain, swelling and/or drainage from the afflicted tooth or 2) an asymptomatic response where the roots are eaten away until the tooth is no longer salvageable. It doesn\u2019t happen to everyone but anyone who has ever had a root canal needs to know this so they can see a dentist immediately, should they experience any changes. Been through this twice and, if I had known about it the first time, I probably could have saved the tooth.",

Normally only my floss would smell but now my whole mouth was smelling like 2 week old garbage. Ended up needing a root canal. Good times, at least it held up for 3 years.",

            "Went to doctor for slight numbness on the side of my face that had been there for a couple months after some dental work.  Doctor prescribed medicine after nothing was found on MRI.  Face started to twitch (known side effect of medicine) within a day.  Vision got fuzzy over the three days.  Doctor increased the dosage.  Within 24 hours entire face was hot, tongue wasn't working and I started to have occasional blackouts.  Doctor took me off that medicine and tried another one over the course of a month.  No more blackouts, vision issues or hot skin.  Numbness was still there and tongue isn't fully functional.  She considered that a win \"Well at least I solved your vision and blackout problems\"......\n\nWhen I complained bout the main reason I had visited her and now I had an additional symptom, she prescribed a new medicine.  Twitches came back, but this time I also developed Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS).  It's a severe reaction to medicine where your skin starts to fall off.  I called her, sent pics and she said it's just a rash.  A day later I contacted her again and she acted like I was being a pain.  Told me to go to my family doctor.  Family doctor said it was SJS and told me to stop taking the medicine and go to the ER immediately.  At the ER, multiple doctors stopped in my room to look at me.  They all agreed it wasn't SJS and prescribed penicillin.  \n\nPharmacist luckily could see my 'rash' and refused to prescribe penicillin because it was obvious I had SJS and penicillin would kill me.  The doctors at the ER knew this, but since they were so confident it wasn't S-J, they figured they'd risk it.  \n\nLuckily when hearing I might have SJS a dermatologist saw me immediately and confirmed it was SJS.  \n\nI look like a burn victim now over most of my body.\n\nA month after getting off all the drugs, I now have a twitch, and permanent loss of feeling in my face and my tongue can only move enough that I don't choke on it.\n\nFuck doctors.

            "My dentist I had growing up was AWFUL. One time I got a cavity filled. The tooth in question started having sensitivity and pain afterwards. Which was pretty normal because that dentist would always leave my bite high. So I went back 3 times to get it fixed. My bite was still high and the sensitivity was getting worse. So he says, \"You're going to need a root canal.\" \n\nGives me a root canal and it was excruciating pain for 2 weeks afterwards. But I'm STILL having sensitivity after 2 weeks. Because he did the wrong tooth! I go back in and he says, \"The tooth next to that one needs a root canal too.\" Right, I just happen to need 2 root canals at 20 years old with little to no dental issues before this. Sure. \n\nHe starts the root canal procedure WITHOUT EVEN ASKING ME ABOUT IT OR CONFIRMING IT WITH ME. I stopped him once I realized what was going on and called my insurance to make sure I could afford it. Then let him do the root canal. Oh and he never gave me a crown on either one.\n\nFast forward 6 years, I had moved and hadn't been to a new dentist in a while because I had gotten married and had 2 kids. I go for a check-up to a new dentist because I was clenching my teeth and having terrible headaches for the last 5 years. Turns out I have a deep infection in my bone up into my sinus cavity. Right on the root of one of my root canal teeth.\n\nMy new dentist (that is AMAZING) sends me to an endodontist who does a re-root canal on the infected tooth. Turns out the shitty dentist MISSED AN ENTIRE ROOT during the canal and that's why I had a deep infection in my bone/sinus cavity for 6 years. \n\nIf you have read this far, don't go to Dr. Erwin in Marysville WA.",

So.... my other teeth may not be affected ever,  but if they are and I have to have them extracted and replaced one at a time at 5000 a go, that's going to be well over 100,000.

My stomach was having a particularly raunchy morning after consuming both dairy and gluten in the same meal and my body had made the decision to cancel all plans for the next hour as I\u2019d be glued to the toilet for fear of shitting my brains out. As I finished up feeling much better off than I was when I sat down, I decided it was time to wash up and set the bidet to low but as I did this the pressure started dropping and I can\u2019t get a good clean in with no pressure. So, I gradually turned it up till it began to return to normal, which just so happened to be at max. Sat there for maybe 2 or 3 seconds and almost as soon as I\u2019d turned it to max, the pressure returned screaming for vengeance and plowed a hole through my anus and power washed my colon leaving me too stunned to scream and scrambled to shut the damn thing off. All the while I was barely able to keep my ass down so the water wouldn\u2019t spray all over the bathroom. I sat there for maybe 30 seconds collecting myself when I felt a deep sloshing and rushing feeling like a trapped fart finally making its escape. I prepared for this thing to rip me half as it exited but I had my expectations blown out of the water, literally. This wanna be fart ended up being a stream of water that turned on my butthole on like a bath faucet and proceeded to shit straight water for about 40 seconds while I could only sit there helpless and wait for the endless stream of water rushing out of my crev to stop. Once I was all finished up I skipped the toilet paper and went right to a bathroom towel as everything in the bowl at this point was dripping wet from the raw power of uncontrolled water pressure. Anyways two hours later now and I still am not able to trust farts and my turds are about as solid as a not completely dried paper machet.\n\nTL;DR Cranked the bidet up to 11 when the pressure started dropping and gave myself a enema when it returned\n\nEDIT: Can\u2019t thank everyone for all the awards, so this is my thanks\n\nEDIT 2: Seen a lot of \u201cwhat\u2019s the bidet\u201d or something like that and it\u2019s a HelloTushy, great bidet though",

So I wait for the opportunity to let it out, and once the time came, I initiated the silent fart protocol. That is the moment when I realized that my asshole had been compromised. Not good.

            "\nThis reminded me of a similar experience I had. I was at one of the airline lounges in Incheon (South Korea). They had one of those super nice toilets with the built in bidet, heated seat, sound effects, etc. The only problem was that the labels of all the controls were in Korean. Having been to Asian countries a few times, I had found most of these toilets also had some kind of little picture on the button that showed you what it did. Not so much in this bathroom. I figured the most worn out button must have been the bidet button, so I pressed it. I heard the familiar hum of the nozzle popping out and thought I had guessed correctly. Suddenly, I felt a blast of icy cold water on my ass. I immediately reached down to try to change the temperature. I found a pair of buttons that was just an up arrow and a down arrow. I frantically pounded the 'up' arrow in hopes that the arctic blizzard happening in my anus would soon come to an end. Instead, what can only be described as the water pressure of a fire hose started to bombard my bottom. I'm pretty sure you could have pressure washed a sidewalk with this thing. I instinctively stood up to try to get some relief. This made matters worse. Instead of my ass receiving the geyser of water, it was now pummeling the backside of my ballsack. It was enough pressure to blast my balls out of the way and then proceed to make it all the way to the door of the stall. My balls then fell back into the stream and the process repeated itself like a lawn sprinkler. I found myself with two choices. I either needed to sit back down and take this icy cold water enema or I could jump out of the way and let the water spray the door. I chose the latter. After pressing nearly every button on the damn controller (there were a lot of them), I finally stopped the wall of water. I took a moment to collect myself. I was soaking wet and the entire stall was dripping. I didn\u2019t dare use the air dryer feature to clean myself up. As I walked out of the stall, I heard the guy in the stall next to me giggle. Apparently, he had heard my entire ordeal.",

Which you probably already know based on how you know its dairy that causes the milk shits.  You can buy either the generic or name brand supplements at most pharmacy's, grocery stores, and even some dollar stores (found some at family dollar in a pinch not too long ago) and they really help.  Most of the time you take one with the first bite and it protects you from your stomach holding a grudge for about half an hour.  I've been buying them for about 5 years now and can attest to them working like a charm for what an internet strangers opinion is worth anyway.  Ps. best deal i've found is at walmart for a 60 count bottle of the fast acting variety.

For one, every time I\u2019d pee the water back out from my butt, it never seemed perfectly clean. And I did NOT wanna risk poo dick. \n\nSo I did it again. And again.

I intended to leave with the satisfaction of a tidy rear end and a job well done.\n\nI had just installed this new bidet in the toilet and was still getting used to it. After the first try it was clear that one would never need the full power afforded by the rather small aperture, as the pressure that creates is far more than even the dirtiest behind would ever need.\n\nAnd so, on this day, I thought I'd push it just a touch beyond gentle, and really try to get things cleared up. It felt uncomfortable, yes, but I persevered, hoping to leave nothing behind. I relaxed the outer sphincter, letting the water penetrate just a touch to flush out anything unseemly. Satisfied, I turned off the bidet, dried everything off, and immediately noticed an achy, itchy feeling that persisted for the next three days. I was worried I'd broken my butt.\n\nFolks, these things are not to be taken lightly, or rather are only to be taken lightly, as anything more than a gentle stream will leave you wishing you'd been more kind to your behind.\n\nAfter a few days the itch went away as my bottom hole healed, and now I know to only turn that thing on to the softest setting.",

It's one of those big MFD things that scans, photocopies and prints on A4, A3 and all sorts of types of paper.\n\nUnfortunately, it doesn't seem to like the cheap copier paper the company buys. If you print any more than about 5-6 pages at once, it jams up and tells you \"Call Service Agent\".\n\nIf you turn it off at the wall, remove all the jammed paper, then turn it back on again, it will usually just check itself and then continue to work normally. Not today though. There must be a bit of paper stuck in a place that we can't see or get to, as it just keeps asking for us to call a service agent.\n\nThis is where I fucked up. My colleague is wearing a fairly short skirt - about halfway down to the knee - with patterned tights. She's looking around while we decide that it definitely needs an engineer to visit. I spy a sticker about halfway down on the unit with all the details we need - the number to call, the 16 digit Reference number and the 16 digit serial number, as well as the machine type etc.  \n\nRather than scrawl all that down onto a post-it, I decide to whip out my phone and take a picture of the sticker. Just as I do, my colleague - who has her back to me - leans down to get into the bottom-most paper tray, my phone gets caught under her skirt as I press the shutter button.   \n\nI say \"whoa!\" as she turns her head to see me with my hand up her skirt, and the flash from my camera goes off. My protest of \"oh my God, no!\" sounds more like I'm upset she caught me than trying to explain it's a genuine mistake.\n\n\"What the heck?\" she asked, with good reason. As I'm trying to explain, our boss comes out of his office, which the printer is situated just outside of, and tries to work out what's happening.\n\nI figure the best thing to do is to take the picture I was trying to, then show them both that the flash picture was just blurry and delete it in front of them. They say they both understand what was happening, but I'm still mortified.\n\nThis happened about half an hour ago, and so far I've had 4 different news articles forwarded to me regarding people who have been convicted of up-skirting, one regarding the actual legislation, and one to a link for a selfie stick with the suggestion I wouldn't need to actually put my hand up anyone's skirt to get a picture if I bought that.\n\nTL; DR: don't try and take pictures of stuff without warning colleagues in the vicinity first.",

        "selftext": "TL;DR at bottom, I waffled.\n\nI built my first ever PC around 3.5 years ago. It's pretty budget but I thought for the \u00a3500 I was spending on parts, it would be pretty decent. So I follow a couple of youtube tutorials to build it and everything worked fine first try, to my absolute surprise. Over the course of the 3 years, I've never had one problem with it other than it was pretty slow and could only run games on low or medium at best, depending on the age of the game. It would take quite a long time to boot, and usually I'd have to let it 'warm up' for a minute or so til I could open browsers or do stuff without apps crashing. Was not ideal to say the least.\n\nCut to 2 weeks ago, a friend was telling me about the new RAM he just got, which got me thinking about my lil ol' PC and how it's 3 years old, and how it could maybe use a few cheap upgrades. The first thing I look at when I open up my PC is the 8GB stick of RAM (some of you may see where this is going) cause I only have 2 RAM slots, and he looked so lonely, so thought I'd look into a 2nd stick to keep him company. After a bit of RAM research, I started seeing the words 'dual-channel' a lot, so delved a bit deeper. I read more and more about how people in similar situations to mine should have originally went with 2x4GB instead of 1x8GB if your motherboard supports dual-channel cause it's magic (I'm reciting stuff I have no idea about, I could be wrong here) and that you should try and use the same manufacturer/frequency if you're going to get multiple sticks. \n\nI found the same model of RAM on eBay for less than \u00a330 a week or so ago, so I ordered it. It arrived today. I plugged it in and immediately thought I'd try and load up something that used to crash my PC hard: a large map on Rust. The large map, which previously suplexed my pc, loaded in faster than a small map used to with 1 stick of RAM, and was running at a solid 60fps while running around chopping stuff. No crashes, no screen tearing, just a working game. So, I redownloaded WoW which I haven't played for a year or so, but I could only run it on medium graphics with sunshafts/shadows off if I wanted anywhere close to 60fps). I logged on and fiddled around with the settings and turns out my PC is capable of running the game on high, with sunshafts/shadows on high, at an unmoving 60fps. All it took was another stick of RAM to make my PC not a piece of shit. I'm in disbelief at how my PC is now like twice as good, and at how it now feels like I've been using half a PC for 3 years. I'm such an idiot.\n\nTL;DR Seemingly badly bottlenecked my PC by only using 1 stick of RAM instead of 2. It went from really shit to really not shit 3.5 years too late. I am idiot.",

            "The main difference in your pc is not that it is using dual channel instead of single channel. It is that you are using 16gb of RAM instead of 8gb.

            "Dual channel vs single channel actually isn't that big of a difference.. you probably were running into an issue with Ram usage overall, not enough ram so windows has to use a page file and things slow down.. having 16gb of ram probably solved most of your problems.",

            "I can slightly trump this. I have 4 RAM slots on my PC, and I bought two sticks of RAM for the express purpose of running dual-channel RAM. However, I thought that just the simple fact that I had two sticks meant it was dual-channel, so I put the sticks directly next to each other. Turns out they had to have a slot in between for the dual-channel to work, and I had my PC running like this for about a year and a half. \n\nI only realised because I was getting super annoyed that Apex Legends was struggling to even reach 60fps on a Ryzen 7 1700X and a GTX 1070. Did some research, set my RAM to work as dual-channel and now I'm getting a consistent 120-144 fps. The joys of dual-channel RAM when its working correctly.\n\nEdit: a lot of people are claiming that I shouldn\u2019t be seeing that much improvement from such a small difference, but I\u2019d just like to point out that at the time, Apex Legends was so poorly optimised that it was running more stably at max settings than at the lowest possible settings.

I ran a speed test and the boot drive was only running at like 200mbps, the other one was running at around 500mbps like it should.  Digging into it I found out that this moron tech they sent out had plugged the boot drive into one of the 2 slower SATA channel that you normally use for optical drives, and the optical drive into one of the 2 faster SATA channels.\n\nFor 7 years my hard drive had been running at less than half the speed it had the potential to run.\n\nNot that this was a surprise, after he left from the repair the system was overheating because he didn't seat the liquid cooler properly, and 3 years ago I replaced a noisy radiator fan and realized that he had installed the fan backwards and on the wrong side of the radiator.",
            "I\u2019ll share with you my recent bottleneck fuck up in hopes it makes you feel better. I\u2019ve had a PC for 5 years and have purposely gained a lot of knowledge about PC gaming in general, so that I wouldn\u2019t feel dumb and not know what I\u2019m taking about or doing. That first build was on the high end of a mid-tier build back then, around $950. Processor was a 4-core i5-6500(only important part for the story). Now in hindsight, I can think back to going into my settings multiple times to get everything possible out of my underwhelming processor; but we will touch on this later, back to the proper chronology of the story. So during this national pandemic, a combination of both being bored while also wanting to upgrade for a whole, I started the process. I felt my main part holding me back was the processor, so I started there with a new mobo to support it. Installed it, overclocked it, but only felt a slight performance boost. This pushed up my upgrade timeline, and before you know it, I practically had a brand new computer - GPU, top of the line SSD, 32gb of RAM, good air cooler for the cpu, essentially everything but the PSU and case. Still only see slight performance upgrades, but still wildly unhappy about the CPU performance. Still hitting 100% usage with just chrome and a CPU-heavy game going(this shouldn\u2019t be happening with the CPU). I thought I had tried everything, felt like I was going crazy, and basically gave up on the pipe dream of running at high performance. Then I decided to check my temps using a program called Speccy; and temps are fine but I noticed something funny... my CPU is only using 2 of its 6 cores. I thought \u201cthat\u2019s odd\u201d and check the task manager to see if it says the same, and it confirms it. Quickly find the setting I changed back in my days of maximizing the i5-6500, and realize it\u2019s set to only run 4 cores at max(still don\u2019t know why only two were being used though). So I uncapped the cores, restarted the rig, and magic. It\u2019s like I have the brand new PC I always dreamed of. Felt pretty dumb after that one, so hope you get a kick out of it, OP",

            "I'm getting Deja Vu because I JUST HAD THIS SAME THING HAPPEN TO ME THIS WEEK.\n\nThree years ago, before I went to school for Comp Tech (just got certified a few months ago! :D), my old junker PC was dying and I had just enough money to build a fresh new one from all new parts.  I do a lot of gaming and happened to know a bunch of computer nerds that I sometimes played games with at the time, so I asked for their advice.  One of them did professional gaming in the TF2 scene, so I gave him my budget and he put together a list of parts for me to buy.  I bought the parts, had another friend in IT build the PC for me while I watched and sorta helped, got it all hooked up, and it ran like a dream.\n\nCut to a couple weeks ago.  My computer had slowed down over the years, though not obnoxiously slow.  It wasn't handling the newest games well, so I decided that with my new job, I'd go ahead and make a few upgrades to keep it running smoothly for a few more years.  First upgrade: more RAM, just in case.  I look up what RAM I have...wait...only 8 gigs?  I thought I had 16 this whole time.  I recall my Comp Tech lessons...\n\n\"When a computer needs more RAM than what you have available, it dips into the hard drives to get the rest.\"\n\nI recall that my computer only slowed down as the hard drives got more and more full.\n\nI order a second 8 gig stick of RAM.  Popped it in earlier this week right after it arrived.  Alright, it loads stuff faster at least.  Wait, low RAM can also affect framerates?  I proceed to try out all the games that didn't work well before.  Not only do they run without a hitch, but I could run some at maximum settings with only very slight, almost unnoticeable frame stuttering.\n\nTurns out my PC often needed 10 or 11 gigs to run my more demanding games, but with only one 8 gig stick, it was dipping into my hard drives...which were almost all in the red for remaining space.  Now that it has 16 gigs by default, it's running just as well as it did when I first built the thing.  Huzzah!\n\nStill gonna upgrade it more to prepare for Cyberpunk and such, but it's nice to have it running so well already from just a 20 dollar upgrade.",
            "Reminds me of the PC I had that I hated the whole time I owned it. Was *so annoyingly noisy*. The fans were deafening.\n\n...3-4 years into owning it I reformatted it and reinstalled windows and the drivers, only to realize I'd never installed the proper motherboard drivers, including fan control. It was *silent* after that. Unfortunately I was doing the reformat to give it to my dad because I had already ordered a replacement.",

            ">you should try and use the same manufacturer/frequency if you're going to get multiple sticks. \n\nYou should not only try to use the same manufacturer, but identical RAM sticks (frequency, size, voltage, everything). In order to eliminate the chance of complications, it's best just to use two sticks of the same model #.\n\nYou can *get away* with mixing RAM in a pinch, but they may not perform well with each other (or at all), and even if they do, they will perform to the lowest common denominator (for instance: mixing an 8gb and a 4gb stick will effectively function as two 4gb sticks).",

I went from \"eh my pc is alright I guess\" to \"now this is pod racing!\"\n\nI had my pc for almost a year before I switched out the ram.

Tell Gramps that some shows he should enjoy are High School DxD and Testament of Sister New Devil. The uncensored versions.\n\nGrandma's gone, and he needs something to keep him busy in his dotage. (I have to assume he's already retirement age or drawing disability) Next round, find you closest Con and tell him about it. The two of you could make the trip. Heck, do some cos-play even. I'm pretty sure that regardless of his age, he resembles SOMEBODY in an anime, even if it's just Dr. Frogface from the RailDex universe. Meanwhile, you can also nudge him towards more \"acceptable\" anime. I'm fairly sure that he'd like The Rising Of The Shield Hero, although the MC has a couple Loli demi-humans. MC takes the high ground when it comes to doing the nasty: He refuses. If you family gets on your case, just tell them to be thankful you didn't introduce him to hentai.\n\nWe're old, dammit, but we ain't dead. My grandkids and I bond over various anime shows and my kids love the idea. I even run the shows past my daughter. Let him look for age appropriate programs that he can watch with the grandkids. That's what I do. A lot of shows  I like but would not be on my top ten faves are shows that I found to watch with my grandkids. Get the nay-sayers in the family to join in and spur him on. Old people do like having family members visit, and I usually have a grand kid or 3 on the weekends. ",

            "The first time I received a blowjob from a cat, I was about eleven years old, and I am not going to lie, it was one of the best blowjobs I have ever gotten. Now I might add that this was purely accidental. You see, my parents decided I was finally old enough to be left home alone, so I did what any normal teenager would do: I stripped naked, jumped on the couch and started beating my meat.\n\nSo after about two minutes of masturbation, my orange cat Jonesy walks in, and honestly I didn't think much of it, but then I noticed that he was getting kind of curious. He was slowly moving closer and closer to me, and then he proceeded to jump on the couch with me, and then he just kind of sat down and quietly observed me. Now at first, I was kind of creeped out by this, but you know I hadn\u2019t finished yet, so I decided to just ignore him and to continue masturbating, and I have to say that this was the best decision of my life.\n\nYou see, after about a few more minutes of watching me, Jonesy decided to help me out. He slowly moved closer and proceeded to put his front paws on my naked thigh, putting his face maybe three to four inches from my penis. Now at this point, I was kind of close to cumming, so I just tilted my head back and closed my eyes. And this is when it finally happened; this is when I felt his tiny little tongue on my rock hard dick, and it was the weirdest, but also the best, feeling ever. His tongue was a bit rugged, yet gentle, and he was moving it so rapidly that I stood no chance: I orgasmed and exploded my seed all over Jonesy\u2019s cute face. Some of the cum even went deep into his throat and he swallowed it with no hesitation. Unfortunately, some of the cum also found its way into his tiny nostrils, causing him to sneeze, which launched the cum into the air, some of it landing on my face and some of it landing on the couch. After the feeling of euphoria settled I slowly returned to reality. I almost couldn't comprehend what had just happened, but I knew I was dead if my parents ever found out, so I proceeded to take a shower with Jonesy and then I thoroughly cleaned the living room, removing every last ounce of cum. My parents never found out.\n\nAfter this, me and Jonesy repeated this experience on the daily. As most people do, I masturbated every night before sleep, so when all the lights in the house went dark, I cracked the door open and Jonesy would slip in, and we would do the deed. Over the years, our little ritual was also becoming more sophisticated. I would proceed to rub my penis with bacon so Jonesy wouldn't just lick the tip of my penis, but he would rather pleasure me from the balls all the way up to the top of the shaft. We decided to also try penetration. Now, Jonesy's asshole was pretty small and tight, so I had to use butter as lubricant, and I have to say that it went pretty well. His virgin asshole felt amazing, but then about a minute in, Jonesy started to get kind of rowdy. I guess he just couldn't take it anymore, and he quickly turned around and actually chomped at my penis, so yeah that was the first and also the last time we did that.\n\nUnfortunately our story ends abruptly. At the age of eight years old, Jonesy was driven over by my neighbor. The weeks following the accident were the darkest times of my life, but I eventually got over it, and I still occasionally wank my dick in honor of Jonesy.\n\nR.I.P. little buddy.",

My girlfriend and I were in a Chipotle parking lot when I see a father in the next car over (parked pretty close) letting me get out of the car first. I tried to hurry up getting out cause it was cold as hell out. Then, I get the feeling that my balls just got squished. Thought no big deal I\u2019ll ride the pain out. One hour later, the pain is still there and I\u2019m about to vomit. Worse pain of my life. As I\u2019m sitting on the toilet letting the boys dangle (even though they were packed up nice and tight and now swollen) I read about testicular torsion on WebMD. Shit, I might lose my ball. Went to urgent care and was told to go to the ER. 2 hours later (and a lost covid test delaying my surgery. Thanks doc) I\u2019m being put under the  knife for the first time. When I come to a wonderful nurse gave me Mardi Gras beads, sparkling apple sauce, and a pair of 2021 glasses. Thank you all nurses doctors and surgeons and staff for putting your life on the line for my balls and everyone else. I just hope my insurance covers party supplies. Happy 2021 y\u2019all. \n\nEdit: sparkling applesauce is what they give you after they put you on a shit ton of morphine and anesthesia. It looks and taste a lot like sparkling apple juice but when you\u2019re that far gone you mistype and say applesauce. \n\n\nTLDR: got testicular torsion on NYE by getting out of a car trying to be nice.

Seems like EVERYONE here feels to share the story of how they almost lost their dangly bits and they apparently want to make it sound VERY common. No one I've ever met has to share an experience like this, and all doctors I know as well as multiple sources say the likelihood of it happening is reported between 0.004 to 0.025% for people under 25 it occurs once in every 4000 to 25000 people depending on where you live and if you're over puberty the chances go SIGNIFICANTLY down from that. It's only common for people with a deformity that results in less tissue holding the testicle in place. NOT common at all. I know all of you here have had bad experiences but it should be made clear it's not something every male should immediately start worrying about and plan for. Someone here said it's 50-50 and another guy even said it's going to happen one day definitely so better have surgery. This is a terrible source of misinformation for a sensitive matter.

            "Totally hear you buddy. I ended up in the ER on the previous night on 30th dec with possible testicular twist. Dr said it was just an infection wanting to send me home with antibiotics.\n The pain was so bad that I was getting spasms on the whole left side of the body. I talked to the nurse and tried to explain that I certainly feel that it's not infection. Nurse was nice enough to convince the Dr to take another look. Then he talked to me again and examined it better. Even though he was convinced that it wasn't torsion as tests was sitting low in the sack, I was able to feel a knot in the spermatic cord and I was able to show him that. He still kept saying that it was tender and inflamed but not knot. \n\nAnyways after a bit of more explaining he manually manipulated it by doing maneuver  that is Basically unscrewing a bulb \ud83d\udca1 and screwing it back. I was relieved of pain instantly. When I told him that, he giggled and said I will start you on antibiotics. I didn't take antibiotics. Went home pain-free after 3 worse hours of my life. \nWas up almost every of that night  hour adjusting the ball to make sure they are in right place.",

Between the time I was checked in and the time the surgeon was prepping apparently one of the doctors manually manipulated my testicle and the \"string like\" thing they are attached to and it untwisted. Immediately I felt it change and the swelling went away.  There were a lot of nurses and doctors around and no one believed what happened. \n\n2 weeks later I went back to the ER because of horrible radiating pain in my testicle and one of the nurses recognized me. He was cool as fuck and made light of it. Turns out I had epididymitis. That was awkward as fuck but less painful and not as much swelling.

So we go to the preferred one- only to end up getting transferred to the other hospital because the preferred hospital was short staffed in the ultrasound department (thanks Covid) my son - who hates docs, needles and COVID tests, ends up having 3 Covid tests (I know one was bc it wasn\u2019t rapid for the surgery- not sure about the other 2), and the obvious IV- which he said didn\u2019t hurt because his stomach did. (We thought it was appendicitis at first) We ride in the ambulance to the other hospital- and they had ultrasound and the surgeon on standby. The confirm torsion and rush him to surgery. His ball was twisted 4 times, and by the time he had surgery it had been 5.5 hours since pain onset. Doc did everything she could to hopefully save his ball, including slicing it up To release the severe swelling-  and doing a skin graft from ball sack skin to re-seal his ball, Doc also flipped his other one right side up (it was upside down, but not twisted) and sticker them both in place to hopefully prevent this from happening if. we find out next week if everything has healed- and healthy. \n\nAs far as his recovery- the first few days sucked, but he only took prescription pain meds for for 3 days. After that it was just Advil and Tylenol and ice packs. He walked like he was riding a horse for about a week. \n\nTighty-whities or boxer briefs and lose pants were his friends!",

By the time they got to the spanish border after three more days, riding bicycles (!), the pain was so bad he took the next train home to Germany. There he was correctly diagnosed with a torsion, they had to remove the ball, that was totally necrotized by then. I had two inflammations of the balls, not fun at all.

Of course the walk in clinic that day was being manned by a female doctor and even at reception, speaking through a muffled COVID mask, trying to explain to someone behind a shield that you have a pain in your nuts, isn't easy, \"WHaaaat?\", \"I HAVE A PAIN IN MY SCROTUM\", eye rolls everywhere. Anyway, the female recognized that it was a sensitive subject and said she could have a look but based on the level of pain I was in, it would be better if I went to emergency. But as soon as I got up and walked out, it all ended, the boys stopped hugging each other and I still went to the hospital. They did x-rays and recommended I see a Urologist. Man even the ultrasound technician was an 'Olga' from Russia, bedside manner as cold as Siberia. \n\nAlso, it reoccured about 2 weeks later, I woke up to use the washroom and the pain kicked in. I panicked but thankfully it stopped. I sleep half naked now, worried about underwear making it worse. I had never heard of Testicular Torsion before August 17.\n\nYou got as far as surgery, unbelievable.",

            "I had testicular torsion 3 times, followed by epididymitis the third time. Doctor said it just happens from everyday activity, most likely from tossing and turning while sleeping. The first two times my balls just untwisted on their own after a few hours. The third time I figured it would just fix itself, but it didn't. After 5 or 6 hours, I was driving down the highway in the most pain I've ever felt. I had to slam on the breaks, pull over, and vomit - never puked from pain before that day. I can only compare it to Thor hammering my balls with the force of 6 atomic bombs. It's not that my balls were the killer, it was the stomach pain that was the worst. Don't get me wrong, my balls hurt a lot and were swollen to the size of a collegiate-size softball. My balls were super sensitive. Every bump in the road felt like another Hulk smash to my beans - my engorged beans. After a couple more barfs and many tears, I made it to the hospital. Walking from the parking lot to the ER front desk was the most difficult thing I've ever done. I remember thinking after each step i took, \"this is it, I'm gonna die\". I got checked in and into a room and the first nurse came in and said, \"can I get you anything to make you more comfortable?\". With tears flying out my eyes like in the cartoons, I begged for some pain killers. The nurse said she'd ask the doctor. I waited for another ten minutes, which in testicular torsion time is 53 years, and another nurse came in asking the same question. I calmly asked for pain killers again and she gave me the same answer. She kept rambling on about medication protocol and I snapped like a 5 year old girl and cried out, \"just get me some fucking pain killers!\". Just so you understand, I don't ever say \"fuck\" in public, I hardly even say it when I'm at home. I couldn't take the pain any longer, I was willing to remove my testicles with my car keys at this point. The kind nurse left for 3 minutes, returned, and assured me I would receive pain killers after i had my nuts ultrasounded. \"Fine, whatever. Let's just get this over with so I can get these pk's\", I thought. The ultrasound nurse, let's call her Becky, rolled in her big cart with the ultrasound equipment and requested I pull my pants and undies down so she could scan my entire scrote. Needless to say, the hospital was cold, and I wasn't going to impress anyone. My pecker looked like a baby carrot wearing a turtleneck. As if I wasn't cold, and embarrassed, enough, Becky had to put freezing ultrasound jelly on my sac to properly scan my nuts. Having anything, including a gentle breeze, contact my balls felt like pure death, but I made it through the ultrasound. As Becky left, I couldn't help but feel like I knew her. I pulled my pants back up, laid back, and waited for my mom to arrive for moral support. My mom walked into the room a couple minutes later and I began to tell her how I felt like I knew Becky. Just as I finished telling her, I remembered... Becky was my then-girlfriend's big sister who I just shared Thanksgiving dinner with a few weeks prior. For a split second, I forgot about my Jupiter-sized balls and felt more embarrassment than I've ever felt before. I told my mom how I knew Becky. She apparently didn't think it was something to be embarrassed about because when she went out of the room to fetch me some water, she ran into Becky and told her I was dating her little sister. My mom returned and we waited together for another 20 minutes, until we heard another knock on my door. What seemed like super slo-mo, I saw the door open and the ultrasound cart creep in inch by inch until finally I saw Becky's face again. Becky and I locked eyes, knowing exactly who each other were, and she said, \"sorry... The results were inconclusive the first time... We have to do this again\". She looked at me with the same sympathy a mother shows to a child that didn't get first place at the talent show. She knew I was embarrassed and in pain, she saw the tears and the quivering scrotum stretched tighter than a snare drum. My mom left the room, I pulled down my pants again to expose my mutant package, and I turned my head towards the wall and didn't say a word. Becky scanned my balls with freezing jelly, again, left, and never returned. The doctor came in soon thereafter and told me I'd need to have emergency surgery to unravel my testicles. Typically, if someone asks me if I want a knife near my scrotum, I'll run for the hills to protect my boys. This was a very unique circumstance, I gladly welcomed the doctor and all his doctor knives to my scrote-opening party. I was put under and when I awoke, I had 20 stitches running down the middle of my coin purse. Of course I was mega high on morphine, but the joy of not having tangled testes was the best feeling on earth. During the surgery, the doctor tethered each ball to its respective side so they would never fight again. To this day, I haven't had another episode and I can still feel the permanent stitches inside my scrotie. My wife is very grateful for the totally rad ball scar.\n\nTLDR: My balls twisted, I puked on the highway, had my balls ultrasounded twice by my then-girlfriend's sister, went into emergency surgery, now I'm safe.

More humorously, they left the hair on the opposite side of my bit and dangles full length, so it looked like some sort of funky clown hairdoo the next day when I checked things out. It was hands down the worst pain I've experienced; I actually threw up in the parking lot of the ER while trying to walk in. Naturally, some folks had to have a car accident about the same time as when I was finally to get taken back to an examining room, so the doctor who was supposed to come see was temporarily diverted to them, making it take even longer before I was finally able to get an initial evaluation and sweet, sweet shot of morphine in my ass. \n\nMy sympathies for your balls, brother.",

She and I seemed to hit it off pretty quick and all was good. I was over at her place one day and we were watching a movie together. Her grandfather that she lived with at the time came in to let us know he was running to the store and would be back in about 45 minutes. Around that same time, her sister let us know she was leaving to go hang out with her boyfriend, leaving the two of us utterly alone. We\u2019re sitting there just watching the movie when she says she\u2019s a little warm and takes her shirt off, so she\u2019s just there in her sweatpants and bra. I\u2019m a virgin at this rate so I\u2019m trying to pretend that that didn\u2019t give me the world\u2019s fastest boner and act like it\u2019s totally nothing. She then decides her sweatpants are a little warm and takes those off too, all the while, I\u2019m pretending to not notice. \n\nNow I\u2019ll be honest here, I legit had no clue what was going on. I was raised to be very very respectful and never assume women are hinting at something, because after all, it was a little warm in there. We\u2019re cuddled up on this sofa, her half naked, when she gets up, walks over to her drawer, and whips out a condom. She walks over to me and goes \u201cSoooo, I have a condom.\u201d to which I reply \u201cOh, cool. Why?\u201d And she says \u201cWell, you never know when you\u2019re going to need one.\u201d then I say \u201cOh fair point. Well keep an eye on it! Those things expire, you know!\u201d She paused for a few moments, then said \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll have it long enough to expire.\u201d and I go \u201cThat\u2019s the spirit!\u201d. She just stares at me, dumbfounded, and I stare back, still painfully unaware of what\u2019s going on. She puts it back, throws her clothes back on and we finish the movie. She broke up with me about a week later\u2026.\n\nTL;DR: half naked girlfriend told me about her condom and I told her to keep an eye on it in case it expires.\n\nEDIT: Some people are saying this is fake because no one can possibly be this oblivious, and honestly, I can\u2019t blame you. That being said, this really is a 100% true story. What you all have to understand is that I was homeschooled until high school and lived in the middle of nowhere with no neighbors, and therefore, I had next to no social interaction. I quite literally had no idea how to interact with people, lol.",

            "On my first date with my now husband, (we were 16) I scooted closer to him on the couch saying \"I'm cold\". I was expecting maybe for us to cuddle a little bit. You know what that lovably dense guy did? \n\nHe got me a blanket. His family and I tease him about it whenever we can!",

Afterwards she made it abundantly clear that when someone has spent the whole day with you and has then made the choice to be alone with you in a bedroom, on a bed, half naked, and asking what you thought about their bikini, it's usually a good sign to initiate or at least move forward.",
            "Lol, in college there was this guy who asked to hang out. I was super sheltered and thought  he honestly  wanted  to hang out since we didn't  know  each other too well. At some point  during  hanging  out he hints it was a date. I was so excited  but tried to play cool and keep it casual.  We go to the liquor  store and buy some booze and go back to my apartment  to watch a movie.  What movie  do we decide to watch? Yep that's right, my sheltered ass thought  Deliverance would  be funny to watch since neither  has  seen it and I love a good cringe Horror? Movie. So this poor guy puts up with it and we drink enough  to where I offer him to spend the night.   \n\nBeing the sheltered virgin I am I figure we don't  know  each other  well so its probably  best if we sleep  separate.  So I pull out the pull out couch bed for him.  We hang out for a bit more making drunk talk about  dinosaurs, and he says \"I wanna bite your face\" I realize  now that was probably  a hint to at least kiss, but I just laugh tell him Goodnight  and go upstairs to bed.",
            "Bro I have *been there*.\n\nSnowing. Stayed at her place after a movie. Parents go to bed to toke and sleep.\n\nShe says let's do what we'd probably would get in trouble for if her parents were still awake. Hikes her long shirt up and gets on top of me.\n\nI'm confused, a virgin, and now I'm worried about getting in trouble. I'm just gonna play it safe and go to sleep. She goes back to her room.\n\nSmooth brain. I still regret it to this day, 20 years later.",

            "When I was 18 I traveled the country with a circus before college (this was before the new fancy Cirque style circuses, we're talking about a $10 admission popcorn and light up swords type of affair).  The people there where mostly two types, circus families consisting of married people and their kids and their circus acts, and carnies who tend to be drifters with various criminal records and drinking issues.   \n\nOne 21 year old woman was there from Russia because her mother was from a circus family and was shaking up with the owner.  So there was her extremely fine Russian self and my young boyish good looking college-bound self, who also happened to be a virgin who had only made out with two or three girls ever.   She flirted for the whole damn summer and at one point while talking with someone else put her arms around me from behind and pressed her claws into me like some sort of hot Russian Domme and said \"Heee izzz mine\" to someone else.   Long story short, I was convinced she did not want to do anything with me, because why would that hottie have any interest in little old me?  \n\nSo that's the story of how I didn't spend the summer before college banging a Russian hottie while we traveled all around the country slinging popcorn and entertaining kids.",

Then standing at the door to my bedroom(right next to the back door/exit) she yawns and says \"well I guess I'll just go home and take a nap\" and I quickly responded \"nice have fun!\" Never heard from her again.

I had asked her out a few years earlier but got rejected so we were just friends and my love went unrequited. Right when I started getting over her during summer break she had gotten into the habit of texting me, and we were getting close. One night she asks me what my favorite sex position was and I text back \"uhh probably cowgirl\". Since I would be just as open with my male friends I figured she was just making conversation. I didnt find out till much later that she was trying to sext me. My other friend had to legitimately spell it out for me that this chick liked me, which I thought impossible since she had rejected me before.\n\nOnce we started going out we were also left alone at her place while watching a movie like in your story. I Tried to do that thing where you casually put your arm around her and accidentally grazed her boob with my hand. My dumbass apologizes and she goes \"that wasn't my boob, this is my boob\" and takes my hand and plants it firmly on her chest. I finally got the message then and the rest was smooth sailing.

I said \u201cno, no one I can really think of. Well, I gotta get home, see ya!\u201d and left.\n\nI realized a couple years later what was going on, and man was I pissed at myself. I had such a huge crush on this girl, I think maybe I might\u2019ve liked her so much that I assumed she was way out of my league and would never be interested in me, so I just never put two and two together. I wound up running into her again a couple years back at my sister\u2019s wedding (her dad was apparently one of my dad\u2019s golfing buddies), and we chatted a bit.

I got home later that day and signed into my Myspace and there was a message from her. \n\n\u201cI enjoyed seeing you at McDonald\u2019s today. You\u2019re sexy as ever.

If I could smack young me I would, but maybe my obliviousness and lack of confidence saved me from an std or something. Some wild girls came after me. \n\nOk fuck, even better story. \n\nI worked with this super sexy redhead. I was single. She and I became really good friends and I just thought she was leagues above me, never even crossed my mind as a possibility. So she told me her computer was running slow and asked me if I could try to speed it up. I said, \u201cSure, I\u2019ll throw some ram in there and upgrade your processor. We\u2019ll get it going faster.\u201d She replies, \u201cOk, thank you.  Also there is a folder in my pictures titled \u201cglitter art\u201d and it\u2019s full of nude photos of me, I\u2019d like you to look at them.\u201d \n\nI took the computer home, looked at the pics, and my god my best friend was all, \u201cShe told you to look at nude pics. Bro. She wants you!!\u201d I said, \u201cOh no bruh it\u2019s not like that, she just trusts me. She\u2019s artsy, she don\u2019t think of me like that.\u201d \n\nGoddamn you young theangryseal!!! Goddamn you!!!\n\nUltimately though I got ahold of myself. My girlfriend is smoking hot and the sweetest thing on this planet.

I was still in the peak and my mind was all over the place.\n\nAs I was walking, a rough looking dog without a collar came up to me and looked at me with such pitiful eyes. I felt a connection with the creature. I thought about it\u2019s life and what it must have gone through to get to this point. Without thinking, I reached into my wallet and pulled out a twenty and just handed it to the dog and it took it in its mouth and ran off with it. I felt so satisfied and warm. About an hour later, I realized what I had done. \n\nI like to think the dog wandered into some shop and gave the twenty to someone who then gave him food, but I know the odds of that are pretty slim. At least I tried to do something nice I guess.\n\nTLDR: did drugs and tried to do something nice, gave a dog money.",

Suddenly I realize I can see the reflection of two eyes, and that it was a huge animal. I didn't know what to do, the front door was too far to run for, so I did the only thing I could think of, and started slapping my knees and saying \"come here! come on! who's a good boy??\" and this ENORMOUS black dog galloped up all slobbery and happy and licked our faces and jumped all over the place. His owner wasn't far behind, and apologized for spooking us, he had dropped the leash or something. If I recall, the dog was only like six months old, and absolutely humongous.

I\u2019ve had little to no \u201cme time\u201d. So tonight, once the kids were tucked in bed, I decided to treat myself to a nice soak in the tub. \nLet me tell y\u2019all, that bitch felt amazing. I scrubbed and soaked and enjoyed. Then, I got up to shower to wash the weekend away. Am I the only weirdo who has to shower after a bath? \nAs I grabbed the handheld shower to wash my nether regions, things were feeling pretty damn good. So I decided to linger there for awhile. I mean, hopefully no kids will try to barge in this late,and the hubs is watching YouTube videos on bowling, so he isn\u2019t exactly turning me on big time at the moment. Perfect timing.\nI was playing with the different massage jets and found the perfect pressure. \nIt was about this time, I assume, my husband got up from his videos to start that load of laundry I\u2019ve been asking him to do since noon.\nHow do I know this?\nBecause just as the pressure got oh so perfect, and my knees began to wobble, the lovely warm water on my lady bits turned to MOLTEN HOT LAVA. I was already hitting that big O so I couldn\u2019t just jump out, I was too shaky. So my dumb ass just releases the lava hose, causing it to spray all over my shuddering legs. My right legs slips, I go down on one knee, and finally reach past the spray to turn off the faucet. \nSo now I\u2019m in bed, legs splayed, with my fan soothing my meat locker.\n\nTL;DR : Used shower head to get off, got burned\n\nEdit: Y\u2019all. Gold, platinum? Front page? Wow, I\u2019m humbled. Thanks.\n\nEdit 2: Husband has found front page. He is an amazing man and bowling is the coolest.\n\nEdit 3: More medals! Thank you! My inbox is a pretty full place but I\u2019m doing my best to reply to all the nice ones. To those saying I\u2019m good with words, thank you, that really means a lot to me.

        "selftext": "tl;dr: Accidentally sent my gf the picture of the engagement ring, kept her from opening it, had to come up with a fake surprise to throw off her suspicions.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n  So this was actually a few months ago. I (24M) had just recently bought an engagement ring to propose to my at the time girlfriend (24F). I was on the phone with a good friend of ours to tell him the news, and wanted to send him the picture of the ring as a way of telling him while talking to him. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n  So I put him on speaker phone and clicked into the text thread, attached the picture, and clicked send. Welp, it was immediately after clicking send that I noticed the texts in the thread didn't look right. I looked up at the name at the top of the thread and my heart stopped: It was my gf. \"Shit\" I said over the phone. My friend asked what was wrong, and I told him I'd have to call him back. Tried finding a way to cancel the message to no avail.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n  As a last ditch effort, I called her, as the message did not yet say \"Delivered\". She answered the phone and I immediately said \"Do you see the message I just sent?\" \"Yeah...it says attachment, why?\" Immediately I blurted \"Dont open it! Just delete the thread. Please.\" \n\n&nbsp;\n\n  She sounded concerned, and asked \"Is this something I should be worried about? You're kinda scaring me lol\". \"No, no,\" I said, \"I just have a little surprise for you I was trying to show someone and don't want to ruin the surprise.\" She relented, but still seemed (naturally) very suspicious. \"Ok, I deleted it. Didn't look at it.\" I know your first thought might be that she looked anyway, but I can 100% promise you that girl would never, ever lie to me. The 1 or 2 times I ever tried to tell a little fib to skirt around something (usually just not wanting to get nagged about something) she was highly upset about it and demanded complete honestly between us. It's just not in her to lie, and she's honestly terrible at it (ie: trying to keep anything as a surpise for me she cannot hide it to save her life).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n  So I had avoided the disaster of her seeing the ring, but now I had her HIGHLY suspicious of me, and needed a way to throw her off the scent. So I immediately went and found a cute little necklace on Etsy I knew she'd like, and bought it and had it shipped to her house. Later that week she got it and texted me, saying I was very sweet and she loved my surprise. Phew. A few weeks later I actually managed to pull off a surprise proposal against all odds, since she had been telling friends for a bit she suspected I was going to propose. Despite all of this, she was completely surprised when her \"girls' day\" with her bff ended with me proporsing at the waterfall near her house, and we came home to a surprise party with our parents and friends to celebrate.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n  When I told her about what that text really was and how I covered my tracks, she laughed, rolled her eyes, and called me an idiot. She was impressed with how I improvised and threw her off track lol. We're getting married next October :)\n\nEdit: pics from the proposal/ring :)\n\n\n\n[Proposal](https://www.reddit.com/user/sshep49/comments/ch0bnl/proposal/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)\n\n[Ring](https://www.reddit.com/user/sshep49/comments/ch0br8/ring/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)",

            "My boss has a version of this story that ended up way worse than yours. He took off work one day to go pick up the ring and obviously didn\u2019t tell his now-wife. She called him at work for something (this was before cell\nphones) and his boss (knowing he was going to pick up the ring) said he was just in the back of the building doing something...she called back a little while later; his boss said the same thing but says that he can\u2019t page him or anything and that he\u2019d give him\nthe message when he saw him. \n\nAt this point she gets suspicious and decides to call her future FIL to see if he can run down to my boss\u2019s work to see if he\u2019s there. So my boss\u2019s dad (who is unaware of all this) drives down and lo-and-behold, his car is gone and he\u2019s not at work. Now they BOTH think he\u2019s up to something. \n\nHe went home a few hours later at his normal time, and she asks him how work was. He makes up an entire lie about his \u201cday at work\u201d, in which she proceeds to lose her shit and tells him she knows everything, asks who he\u2019s cheating on her with, etc. He tries to cover it up in order to not totally ruin the surprise, but it backfired and she was in tears literally about to pack up her things and walk out the door. That\u2019s when he finally had to pull the ring out of his pocket and be like THIS IS WHAT I WAS ACTUALLY DOING ARE YOU HAPPY NOW???? And she was like oh....yeah :)",

            "I did almost the same thing, except with my husband's surprise birthday party.\n\nOur reception was a couple of days after his birthday, and with so many people coming I thought it would be perfect to turn our reception into a surprise birthday party. I hired my friend to design an info card I would insert in our invites. She did a bang up job and I was so excited I wanted to share it with his mom.\n\nSo I pull up Messenger, type in the last name and click send. Only...my fat thumb hit send on his profile. This was before Messenger had the option to undo. So I did the only thing I could think of. I spammed him with, like, 15 memes so I knew it was buried and texted to NOT, under ANY circumstances scroll up in our thread.\n\nObviously he was suspicious and I told the truth, it was evidence of a surprise I was planning for him that I accidentally sent to him. Thankfully he laughed and agreed he wouldn't snoop.\n\nCut to the reception, when we're supposed to \"cut the cake\", everyone burst into \"Happy Birthday \" and he absolutely loved it.\n\nSo here's to us, having good intentions and almost botching it lol.",

            "This'll get buried, but for YOU OP, something similar happened to me (although much less serious). Also, congratulations.\n\nBasically I hit it off with this girl on Tinder, her bio and pics seemed really promising (this is my current girlfriend of almost two years). I told my friend about it, and he wanted all the details. We messaged some more and set up a date. Having just gotten off an overnight shift I was extremely tired, so instead of telling my friend what happened I just screenshotted the conversation and sent it to my friend. But instead of sending it to my friend, I screenshotted the picture, and just immediately hit the send picture button, IN THE CONVERSATION WHERE I TOOK THE PICTURE. I freaked out at how weird that might seem, how I might've ruined my chances with this seemingly amazing girl, tried to turn off my phone before it sent to no avail. After I calmed down I decided to own up to it, said something to the effect of \"hey I was just really excited about our upcoming date and meant to show that to my friend but sent it to you.\" and she thought it was cute / funny and all was well. But dear god that 15 minutes after I fucked up. I can't even imagine trying to play off a picture of an engagement ring, thanks for the new anxiety I'll inevitably be dealing with.",

Having an itchy scalp and the occasional teasing from kids was a mild annoyance, so I never sought a remedy.\n\nAs an adult, I started using selenium sulfide shampoos that immediately cured my dandruff. It became my daily shampoo for the next 15 years. Somewhere along the line, I also started showering earlier so my hair would dry to avoid bed head. One day my barber mentioned my hair smelled like sulfur as if I was using too much dandruff shampoo. She said I dont need daily treatments with that stuff. So I stopped to see how long it takes for the dandruff to come back so I could make a schedule. It never did.\n\nOne random day some years later I suddenly had dandruff. It was at this moment that I finally thought about why I had dandruff. Why now after all these years? I always assumed it was genetic. What changed recently? Was it something I'm doing and not genetic? Then it occured to me. I had a pair of long nights a couple days ago. I showered , but was too tired to dry my hair and fell asleep. I finally googled \"wet hair and dandruff\" and gained closure for my childhood affliction.\n\nIf anyone else out there has a dandruff problem, wet hair cultivates existing microbes in your scalp that causes dandruff. I was propagating them on my pillow every night for 15 years.\n\nTL;DR I slept with wet hair regularly as a kid resulting in moderate dandruff until I was an adult.\n\n*Edit. Glad my post helped all you other flaky headed goobers. Be advised there's other reasons why dandruff occurs so your mileage may vary. Thanks for the awards and rip inbox.",

            "I work for a dermatologist and it is true that wet hair can cause dandruff, what we call seborrheic dermatitis. It\u2019s caused by an excess amount of yeast on our scalp from moisture (we all have yeast on our scalp, but this is an overproduction). It can also cause skin colored bumps on your forehead (pityrosporum folliculitis) that people like to confuse for acne bumps. You can control this by blow drying your hair to reduce the overproduction of yeast and to wash with Head and Shoulders shampoo (recommend just shampoo, not the 2-in-1 with conditioner), let sit in hair for 6-8 minutes, then rinse off. You can do this every other day for maintenance. Hope this helps! :)\n\n**Disclaimer: I am not a medical physician, and am only providing advice per experience working as an Medical Assistant at a dermatologist.",

Apple Cider Vinegar rinses - NOT dandruff shampoo - will help your hair.  Dandruff shampoo can totally strip your hair, causing your scalp to overproduce oil in response, which leads to more dandruff.   A lot of oil on your scalp means skin has a hard time naturally flaking off, and you get build up of dead skin cells, which clump up and become visible dandruff.",

Still I had really bad dandruff- more of a seasonal kind(more during summer months, as it gets really hot and humid around here). \n\n\nIn 2019, I did a smoothening treatment, and I had no dandruff issues for a good while. I failed to follow up with the treatment, and after an year, I started to get really flaky and bad dandruff- which would drop on my clothes and everywhere I went. I still used to shower in the mornings. I applied anti dandruff medications twice a week but it was of no help.Then I finally decided to chop off a good length of my hair and let my natural curls grow back. Meanwhile I bought a scalp shampoo massager and also a milder shampoo. Also started a deep conditioning routine. And suddenly all my dandruff was gone- totally gone! And it made me so so happy! It cleared all my scalp related issues. \n\n\nNow I'm encouraging my dad to use the scalp massager too-he has had very bad dandruff issues for a long time(though he showers in the morning and never goes to bed with wet hair). I don't know if that would work for him, but let's see anyways!",

After finally passing them I had them sent in to be analyzed and the cause came back as chronic dehydration.

I also realized that this completely eliminated my dandruff problem to where I don't even think about it anymore.\n\n It seems obvious but not having enough water would of course lead to dry itchy skin.

Not because I sleep with wet hair (in fact, I avoid doing that at all costs because it makes me cold and makes my hair get weird bends and kinks in it that are impossible to fix without washing again), but because my hair takes for-freaking-ever to dry. My hair is very thick (2\u201d+ diameter ponytail and takes 5.5-6 tubes of color if I want to dye it) and because of that, it takes an eon to dry fully.

        "selftext": "Obligatory: This didn't happen today. Also TLDR at the end.\n\nContext : I am from India. I never exactly received a sex talk from my parents \n\nWhen I was 14, I had noticed there was a small lump of skin in my scrotum just above my nuts. I was so dumb, that I thought that was the formation of a new testicle. I had had recently seen a news clippings with a woman who had 3 breasts. So I thought it would be applicable for guys as well. So the dumb me decided that I should wait it off and see the \"third testicle\" grow. I also thought that this would be a sign of virility. \n\nFast forward 1.5 years, the lump became bigger and oddly shaped and it would pain a lot sometimes. At that time I had recently read about cancer in school. Now I had convinced myself that the lump was actually a tumor. That started freaking me out a lot. I used masturbate a lot, so I believed that that was the reason this was caused. Since I never talked to my parents about my masturbation habits, I was too shy to talk to my parents about it. The tumor would retract back into my abdomen some times. One time when I actually mustered the courage to talk to my parents about it, it had retracted back. They assumed that the pain was being caused because of my testicles descending. So I also ignored it and prayed that the tumor would just go away. \n\nFew years went by and I tried to ignore my tumor as much as possible. Once I read an article about cysts, and I believed that that swelling could also be a cyst. Whenever I'd read about a new swelling or tumor, I'd just believe that that's what I had.\n\nWhen I started college and moved to a dorm, I would try everything possible for people to not see me naked. The tumor had become ugly, but it was was of a constant size now. I just assumed that my body was abnormal and I couldn't do anything about it. \n\nFast forward to this year (currently 21), I had to come back to my home because of COVID. One day I was changing my clothes after taking a shower. My brother accidentally walked into me changing my clothes. He saw my crotch and was ridiculously surprised at what that monstrosity was. That was the first time I confessed about my crotch issues to anyone. After having this tumor for so long, I was more ashamed that being an adult, I wasn't able to come clean about a medical issue I was facing. My brother nudged me for a few days and forced me to talk to my parents about this issue. I finally caved in and talked to my father about this. He took me to the doctor the next day. I was nervous that the doctor would be shocked and I would be diagnosed with stage four cancer or something. Turns out it was just a hernia. Apparently as the doctor has speculated, this hernia was caused because my muscles were weak and the gap created when the testes descend didn't seal properly causing the hernia. I got my surgery scheduled within a few days. I got a laparoscopy to treat my hernia. It's been 1.5 months since my surgery. I've made great recovery since. \n\nI've wasted over 6-7 years of my life overthinking and living with discomfort because of my hernia. \n\nTLDR: I didn't get my hernia checked up on time and ended up having body image issues for almost 5 years.",

            "> Apparently as the doctor has speculated, this hernia was caused because my muscles were weak and the gap created when the testes descend didn't seal properly causing the hernia.  \n\nMales take note: this is actually not that uncommon.  \n\n(Not an expert, but you'll get the gist) When our testes form they come through our abdominal walls, which can leave a weak spot in our abdominal muscles.  \nThis can lead to a hernia in any stage of life. My father had it happen in his 60s after lifting something too heavy, and because there was that weakness it caused a hernia.  \n\nKeyhole surgery fixes the issue, with a sort of bio mesh they put over the inside of the weakened part so your intestines dont try to jump through it.  \nSo yeah, it's fixable but it's a thing to keep in mind if you have testicles.  \n\n**Tldr, always get weird lumps checked out!**  \n\nOn the subject of lumps double goes for your testes themselves. Serious talk, get familiar with how they feel and check them semi regularly. If you notice a bump or change in how they feel you should get checked.",

        "selftext": "This actually happened a few hours ago and I am writing this outside out of fear of going back into the apartment.\n\nThe iconic and viral clip of a mother storming in on her children and asking which one of them didn't flush after using the toilet has been a corner stone of me and my boyfriend's relationship.\n\nToday, my boyfriend took the largest poop I have ever seen. And I mean largest. It wasn't even broken into pieces. One long continuous poop. And while he might have tried to flush it, it did not work and ended up greeting me in the face when I too, needed to take an incredibly large poop. Out of pure humour, I barged straight into my boyfriends WFH office and in my best and loudest Scottish accent said \"DID YA TAKE A SHIT AND NOT FLUSH? DISGUUUSTAN!!\".\n\nThe intention was to laugh with my boyfriend and for him to come and see how it didn't flush correctly. Instead, his face went completely white and jaw dropped. He was on a video call with not only his boss, but his entire team. We normally have a little sign to put on the door when we are in video calls, but just like how he maybe forgot to flush, he forgot to let me know he was having a company wide meeting where he was presenting.\n\n**TLDR: Today life imitated art and I interrupted my boyfriends company wide meeting by accusing him of taking a poop without flushing.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: Everything is somewhat fine between us. We often times like to prank and scare one another, so it comes with the territory. Luckily most of his (younger) colleagues know the video reference and thought I was doing it intentionally as a joke. However now he is a little panicked that this will make it to the front page and some people he works with will realise it most definitely wasn't a joke and he most definitely made the worlds largest poop. \n\nEdit: well, you guys did it. TIFU\u2019ed by thinking this wouldn\u2019t make it to the front page, or at very least there would be another gay European couple male who had his company wide meeting interrupted by his boyfriend quoting a viral video about his large shit. One of his colleagues wrote him that they saw this post. I wanted to delete it but for whatever reason he thinks that\u2019s even worse. We have decided the best course of action is to share this post with the wider company and doxx/expose me as a drag race and real housewives/below deck super fan which is equally as embarrassing. I guess i deserve this karma! Thank you all for giving us a massive laugh this lockdown and adding another (cute) shitty layer to our relationship \u2764\ufe0f",

            "If it will make your bf feel better, share my story:\n\nMy gf and I joke about and talk about our poops pretty regularly. One fateful day, we were engaged in a text conversation about our poops. My girlfriend said she had the biggest dump ever and felt incredibly empty afterwards. I was impressed and a little jealous and responded: \n\n\"I had one that felt like a struggle, but there was a ton of poop. I still don't feel empty though. \"\n\nAfter a while I wondered why she didn't respond and saw that I had accidentally texted that to my boss. I immediately texted back and said, sorry, that text was meant for my girlfriend and we are disgusting. He never brought it up. Lol\n\nI posted a screenshot shot of the text to my Instagram and it was my most liked post of all time.",
            "This one bar I worked in had this awesome supervisor. We'll call him R. Anyways, one day R is severely hung over, and we're full teaming a massive night (world Cup perhaps?) so it's all hands on deck.\n\nAt the time I was preggos, so I was working solo on a sweet private balcony bar. My Bar shuts an hour or so earlier than the other bars in the venue, and I finally get to run down and pee in the disabled toilet, taking my very recognisable (butterfly knife style) barblade (bottle opener. Yes it's as cool and fun as it sounds) out of my pocket and to the side for safekeeping. \n\nOf course, I forget to pick it up, and don't notice for about 30 mins. When I do I freak and run back to the toilet praying and hoping it's still there, but someone's inside and I have to keep working. I ask the doormen to radio me when they're out.\n\nAnother (A-hole of a) colleague approaches me shortly later, barblade in hand and simply tells me 'R says, he knows what you did.' smiles, and fecks off again. \n\nI freak, thinking he's found drugs in there and thinks it's me. I'm genuinely panicked. I cannot get fired! \n\nNot drugs though. Turns out someone had had a log pile shit in there, much like the one described in this story. One looong ass, solid turd.\n\nR had gone into the toilet to throw up from the hangover, and is faced with this colossal monstrosity, that simply will not flush. It's rolling, bobbing, having a grand ole time while he's stood there, gagging like no tomorrow, until eventually he has to throw up on top of it. Delicious, right? \n\nWhen he told me, I was dying with laughter and total relief. \nPretty sure he still thinks it's me, but I'd rather he think I left a giant turd than be stupid enough to take drugs in there.\n\nTL;DR someone left a giant chonkeh shit in work toilet, hungover supervisor had to vomit on top of the unflushable titanicular turd, thought it was me cause I left my barblade in there. *I know what you did*.",

We are both open minded and confident when it comes to sex so there is little we haven't done and we love it all.  Nothing is gross or weird with us when we're getting off.\n\nHe asked me to help wax his balls a few days ago.  I did.  Unfortunately the one section of skin came off with the wax strip.  It was about the size of a quarter but he's tough and didn't complain.\n\nI walk out of the master bathroom to find him jerking off.  He's not home 90% of the year because of work so I, of course, wanted to help him despite staying up late drinking and fucking and therefore worrying the motion of a blow job or getting fucked might make me nauseous which would ruin the mood.  I thought \"I'll lick his perfect balls and help by applying pressure to the base of his dick right under his balls\".  \n\nHe's loving it.  I'm loving licking and sucking and cradling his balls, independently and simultaneously, in my mouth.\n\nI feel something as I'm making circles with my tongue.  No big deal whether it's hair or lint whatever so I quickly pull my finger and thumb up to retrieve the foreign, unknown object.  As I pluck it off my tongue (trying not to miss a beat of our quality time) I glance at it.  It's grey and slimy, bunched up and longer than my longest fingernail.  It took a half a second to realize that I had literally sucked the scab off my husband's balls.  \n\nTL;DR - Exfoliated husband's balls with my mouth.",

        "selftext": "TLDR at the bottom.\nThis happened in the Spring of 2015.\n\n\u00a0My girlfriend at the time, a hardcore Disney fanatic we'll call Becky, had commissioned a custom Elsa cosplay from the movie Frozen.\u00a0 \u00a0A friend of hers (Ryan) who Becky had lost contact with for several years, had come back into her life about that time.\u00a0 While we were hanging out, Ryan mentioned his youngest daughter was having her 5th birthday party the next day. Like any child alive and under the age of 14 at the time, her favorite movie was Frozen.\u00a0\u00a0I mentioned Becky's Elsa cosplay to Ryan, and suggested she show up to the birthday party in character to surprise his daughter.\u00a0 Both of them loved this idea.\n\nThe birthday party wasn't being held at Ryan's home.\u00a0 It was being held at a community center in the suburb they lived in.\u00a0 It was a large, spacious, 2 story building. It had a central atrium where the main stair were, and all but 2 of the rooms had large windows looking into the heart of the building.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAs Becky and I arrived at the community on the April day, the early morning sunshine gave way to gray clouds, and gentle slow flurries started to fall. This is not uncommon in Minnesota in early April, but the timing made me smile.\nThen it happened...\n\nAs we entered the community center, the rooms all around us were filled with families and children having birthday parties and other events. All the rooms but one were occupied that day.\u00a0 As the living personification of Elsa strolled the doorway into the central atrium...the parties stopped.\n\nGrade school aged children fixed their gaze on the shimmering blue dress and translucent cape, the long blonde wig, the pale white skin, like lionesses stalking gazelles. The talking and yelling got quiet as the collectively drew in their breaths in a gasp...\n\nAnd then screaming began:\n\n\"Mom, its Elsa!\"\n\"Dad can I go meet Elsa!?!?!\"\n\"CAN WE PLEASE HAVE ELSA AT OUR PARTY???? PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE?!?!?\"\n\n\u00a0For a moment I felt like one of the coolest kids in school.\u00a0 After all I was escorting \"Elsa\" to her engagement. I was lucky enough to be dating this bad ass cosplayer. She was authentic enough for the kids to believe it was was the actual character.\n\n\u00a0And then I saw the expressions on the adults faces...\n\nSeveral adults were next to their children, pointing and enjoying their children's moment of wonder as a \"Disney Princess\" walked by them in real life.\u00a0 \u00a0But when I locked eyes with what the parents of the child whose birthday was being celebrated, the expression was undeniable.\n\nScorn.\nSheer Scorn.\n\n\u00a0Because from the moment my girlfriend walked into that building, no matter how awesome the birthday party was: Their child's birthday party did NOT have Elsa at it.\u00a0 And now they were going to have to deal with that fact.\n\nThe room Ryan's daughter was celebrating her birthday in was possibly a large storage closet at one point in time. But the 10 children and small group of parents fit inside of it nicely. There was also the added benefit that it had no windows facing into or out of the building, so the children didn't see Becky stroll up to the door before she made her entrance.\n\n\u00a0Once Becky was in the room the magic of a little girl's imagination was overpowering. Before Becky even sat down next to the 5 year old, she was crying happy tears and looked like she might pass out from excitement. The other children at the birthday party were equally spellbound, save for one 7 year old boy who was NOT going be fooled and insisted Becky wasn't the REAL Elsa.\n\n\u00a0With the patience of a saint, Becky sat with the birthday girl enjoying cake, watching her open presents, answering endless questions about Arendelle, Reindeer, Trolls, Princess Anna... all the while the 7 year old denied her authenticity. Every time the boy try to catch Becky up in a logic trap, Becky was quick enough to answer with a completely plausible reason for why she did not have reindeer with her, and why she wouldn't perform magic in Minnesota ( The governor had asked her not to after all...)\n\n\u00a0After 45 minutes of being overloaded on cuteness, cake, and small children screaming, I stepped outside the room to catch a breath child free air for a few minutes. I noticed through the second story windows that the snowfall had gotten much thicker and heavier. Quarter sized snowflakes were floating slowly,\u00a0 cinematically through the air and covering everything in sight. It was incredibly beautiful, so much so that I didn't notice the 5 adults staring at me from 10 feet away.\n\n\u00a0One of them cautiously approached me and said, \"You came with that girl in the princess costume right?\"\u00a0I told them I had, at which point he asked me if Becky would stop by his granddaughter's birthday party. And with that the floodgates opened as all the other people began asking for Becky to stop into their parties too.\u00a0\n\"Real guickly, just for a few minutes...\"\n\"Just for a quick photo!\"\"\nI'll pay if you do, $50...\"\n\"I'll pay $100 but she has to sing the song!\"\u00a0\n\"It would mean so much to him.\"\"Please she won't stop crying about it. It's her fault for doing this to her after all.\"\n\nAnd then I quickly realized I was in hostile territory...\n\nI calmly told them I would ask if it was possible, knowing it wasn't, and slipped back into the room.\u00a0 \u00a0Becky was just finishing up her rendition of \"Let It Go\"\u00a0 And all the children but one were singing along with her.\u00a0 Becky sat down with the birthday girl, as the 7 year old doubter continued his attacks on her identity.\u00a0 The birthday girl, (bless her) turned to this 7 year old little cynic and said, \"She's answered all your questions right, she's Elsa!\u00a0 Now leave her alone!\"\n\n\u00a0I never wanted to high five a kid so hard in my entire life.\n\nAs the birthday party was winding down about then, I whispered to Becky that some of the other parents were jealous and wanted her presence at their parties. She flatly turned that notion down. When I mention the snowfall getting heavy, Becky's eyes lit up a bit.\n\nBecky turned to the birthday girl and said, \"Guess what? I'm not supposed to do this. But it's your birthday so if you keep a secret for me, maybe I can get away with some magic...\"\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0The birthday girl carefully nodded her head, unblinking as if she was afraid she might miss whatever would come next. Becky closed her eyes and went into a expression of serene concentration for about 30 seconds. When she opened her eyes she stood up and led the birthday girl outside of the room to the 2nd floor windows.\n\u00a0\nWhere there had been a cold but sunny Minnesota spring day an hour before there was now a wintery twilight blanketed in thick white snow, still coming down. All the children followed into the hallway, and stared in absolute wonder. At this point even the 7 year old doubting child had his jaw a near the floor.\n\n\u00a0Becky got the biggest hug from the birthday girl as she said goodbye, and the children were herded back into the celebration room to collect their toys, candy, and presents.\u00a0 \u00a0I caught a few adults from the other parties waiting on the 2nd floor, expectantly looking towards us. I slowly shook my head \"No\" in their direction at which point I received a few death glares.\n\n\u00a0We decided to exit out the opposite side of the building\u00a0than we had entered, for safety reasons. As we were 30 feet from the door, a group of a dozen children and their parents made their way in the community center. As one of the mothers was commenting, \"I didn't think it was supposed to snow today...\"\u00a0 Becky and I walked past the group quickly. The audible gasps from the children were hysterical. One child even pointed and yelled \"That's why its snowing, Elsa did it!\"\n\n\u00a0The look of cognitive dissonance on the parents face was priceless...but I knew another  parent would have to explain why they hadn't gotten Elsa to attend their child birthday.\n\nTLDR:\u00a0My girlfriend dressed up as Elsa for a birthday party in the Spring of 2015. The parents of other children having birthday parties in the same building got angry/jealous because their party didn't have Elsa attending. An incredibly convenient spring snowstorm convinced a bunch of grade school children that my girlfriend was absolutely the real Elsa..",

Their safety and comfort is my number 1 priority. You have to set the rules and uphold the boundaries that the performer cannot.  Mascot (or elsa in this case) being a dick to kids? Bad look, even if the kid hit them or was climbing on them, getting in the way of other kids, or generally being a nuisance.  The \u201cbody guard\u201d being somewhat of a dick to kids?

One time on my way back to my car there was a little girl riding her bike in what WAS an empty parking lot at the time I got there. I stopped and said hi really quick and told her that she was so brave for practicing riding her bike. Then I got in my car and left. A few days later a mutual friend tagged me in the mother's post on fb (she had taken a picture and my friend recognized me). The mom had a hard time convincing her daughter to practice riding her bike and promised her they would do something special if she did it. Apparently meeting a \"real\" princess more than sufficed, even if she drove a minivan.",
            "That's awesome of your then girlfriend. Also, as a parent of a child who's been the other parent before, it's not you or your then gf fault that the other kids didn't have a Disney character there. Yes, it sucks when a kid has something that my kid wants and there's no way for me to provide it, but I've taught my kids to be happy they got to experience it with them (like at least those kids got to see Elsa & it go from sunny to snowy like that) and be happy for their friends. I've also told them to recognize that they get things that other kids don't. So, basically what I'm saying is, you didn't ruin the other kids bday parties; those parents should appreciate that their kids got to see Elsa and see the sunny morning turn to snow. I bet that was awesome for all the kids that caught a glimpse of her that day!",

I was to have an airy, high-pitched voice which I didn't maintain at all.  This one girl kept following us around with neverending questions after countless attempts at disappearing.

            "Beautiful story. You're a fine writer; write more!",
            "I had something similar happen to me once (except it happened to me directly). I dressed up as a Disney princess for my little cousin's 6th birthday, it wasn't a paid job or anything, and I was fully expecting it to be a party of 12-15 kids - her Mom had estimated that beforehand. \n\nIt was the month before Halloween, so I figured I could put a pretty penny into it and potentially get my money's worth by using it for a few costume contests or general Halloween events as well.\n\nAnyway, the party was being held at a bowling alley I'd never been to. As a kid, I remember birthday parties being held in a particular party room booked in advance. This wasn't the case here, they had only booked a specific lane and two tables with seats. Absolutely no privacy. Worse yet, 6-7 birthday parties were going on using the lanes directly surrounding my cousin's. They were being hosted by young teenaged workers called \"party heroes\", who were not in costume, and they were barely able to control the massive amount of kids\n\nNevertheless, they would intermittently do the \"Cha Cha Slide\" and dance to \"Celebration\" by Kool & The Gang which would get the kids even more riled up.\n\nI watched this going on for a short amount of time before taking a deep breath and approaching my cousin's party. They were so excited, hopping up and down, screaming. Just like what happened to your girlfriend, all of the parties around immediately took notice. The kids immediately stopped bowling, and they started flooding toward me, pulling on my wig, trying to climb my dress, and just losing their shit. Worse yet, one set of parents chose to do their cake at the beginning of their party, so some of the kids had caked up hands, cake that was now on my costume.\n\nInitially I was a bit upset (because I wasn't given proper warning or notice), but as soon as I walked in and realised the situation, I kind of expected it to go the way that it did. The dress already had cake on it, the wig was quickly getting ruined, so I ended up embracing the situation. I gave my cousin my princess tiara to wear, dubbing her honorary princess of the day, which made all of the kids treat her extra special (with most parent's offering her birthday cake or party/loot bags). She was so thrilled. \n\nI did the dances with the party heroes, helped parents cut cake, and played with all of the kids. It was honestly more exhausting than my actual job, haha, but totally worth it to make all of those kids happy. And, of course, the costume was ruined and couldn't be used again - but surprisingly, no regrets, it was fun.",
            "Damn this is a good story. I like it.",
            "This is such a wholesome and pure story, and the TIFU part somehow makes it even more that way, perhaps because so many other kids wanted Elsa to attend their parties too.

Like oh man parents are scorning us we didn\u2019t know why turns out the outfit ripped, or in the sun it was see through so it required a gown underneath for the effect.\n\n Just the build up really made me think wardrobe malfunctions in front of thousands of kids who\u2019s childhood are now ruined.

The cow never liked me messing with him, and whenever I was around, she'd be giving me the hairy eyeball after that. \n\nWell, when the calf was a couple months old, we were switching pastures. All the cows and calves were up at the lot drinking, so we'd close one gate and open another. \n\nHowever, brain damage calf never went up, so I was out trying to get him up to the lane. He never could walk straight and would go in circles and fall down from time to time.\n\nAfter an hour struggling, I'm covered in sweat and cow shit but we're approaching the gate.

But she was friends with him before we had even gotten together so she recognized his number and his prank didnt really  work out.\n\nFast forward 6 or 7 years to the weekend just passed.\nIm sitting on the couch watching tv and my partner is upstairs my 8 year old daughter is bored so i give her my phone to play a game on.\n\nQue fuck up.\nI never changed todds name back. Its been a running joke between us for years.\nSo \"sexy jess from work\" calls whilst my daughter has  my phone. She freaks out. Comes running into the lounge room crying throws my phone at me and screams \"i hate you dad!\". She runs off upstairs.\nSo im sitting there really confused. After a few seconds i follow her upstairs. I can hear her crying then i hear my partner start laughing hysterically.\nNow im really confused. I get to the bedroom. My partner just  holds up my phone showing a missed call from \"sexy jess from work\". I piece together whats happened and spend the next 20 minutes explaining to my daughter and calming her down then call todd back to tell hin how his joke has made it to the next generation.\n\nTldr : buddy saved his name in my phone too \"sexy jess from work\" several years ago as a joke. Today my daughter sees it freaks out and thinks im cheating on hwr mother.\n\nSorry for formatting on mobile.\n\n\nEdit. Wow this blew up.\n\nSo yes my daughter threw my phone at me. Then picked it up and took it with her upstairs.\n\nIm Australian. My daughter is in grade 4 and is quite intelligent. Yes she knows what sexy is and yes she knows what cheating is.\n\nSorry for the spelling and lack of grammar, im lazy.",

Also, if I was OP I'd probably be thinking 'damn my kid is so smart.'\n\nCongrats on having either a super smart 8 year old OP, or just a regular 8 year old and 8 year old are smarter than I thought.\n\nEDIT: Bunch of people saying 'she doesn't need to know all about these things to act that way', and similar things. To which I'd say she doesn't need to know EVERYTHING about sex, cheating, desire, etc, but she needs to know SOMETHING in order to make the connections she has, and that something needs to be enough to piece together a pretty complex idea.",

        "selftext": "This happened yesterday. My twins are 3 year old fraternal girls that recently graduated to using the downstairs powder room to go potty instead of the dump cups. Twin A has no issue with number 1 or number 2 but Twin B is a different story. Twin B is a clencher. She holds her poop. I have a total of 4 kids and she is the only one to ever do this. Her pediatrician reccomended Pedia-lax (stool softener for kids) make the job easier when the time came. So 2 days of OTC Pedia-lax and still no poop. \n\nThen comes day 3. Everything is normal and on schedule. Nothing out of the ordinary. Potty time comes and Twin A is in and out in about 5 minutes. Twin B's turn. She seemed tense. Like more tense than usual. She holds the potty seat on the toilet and locks her knees together. She's clenching. So to help the process, I hold her legs up so she has no way of clenching. She's getting upset and angry. I try to tell her to just let it go. \n\nThen I smell it. I pick her up and there it is. The largest poo I have ever seen in my entire life. I was shook. I clean Twin B up and get her settled in the playroom. Then make my way back to the impossibly gargantuan poo my little princess dropped off. I didn't know what to do. If I flushed it the toilet would definitely clog. I took a picture of it and sent it to my husband asking what I should do. He's an OTR truck driver and usually misses out on adventures like this. He calls me immediately laughing, joking that the poo looks like it's the size of Twin B's arm. He's not wrong. Then he tells me to break it up with the plunger. Well, that's not gonna work because not only is it long and poking out of the toilet water like a choco crocodile but it also has some girth to it. I'm freaking out at this moment because I know what I have to do. I grab an old steak knife that no one loves and attempt to cut the poo log into smaller \"poolettes\". \n\nIt's like clay. The smell is horrid. I start dry heaving. My 2 sons and husband are all laughing hysterically. This is hell. I'm in hell. I get it down to about 4 slices and toss the newly dubbed \"poop knife\" in the trash. Then, with plunger in hand, I flush. It went down no problem and now I am 100% invested in helping Twin B have a regular poo schedule.\n\nI am traumatized.\nNever again.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nTo avoid clogging a toilet I chopped a record breaking log of poo (courtesy of my 3 yr old daughter) in to 4 pieces with a steak knife. Which I quickly found out was my worse nightmare.\n\n**EDIT to add link to pictures \n\nCLICK AT YOUR OWN RISK\n\n[The horror](https://imgur.com/a/tN5bLJu)",

She eventually comes back with a 3 foot long 2\" diameter stick and is proudly waving it in the air. Not the twig we were expecting but should work. Finally get the poop to flush and open the camper door to throw the stick in the fire pit. Must have had a little too much umph on it because it hit the awning instead and landed just feet outside the door.

            "As a 32 year old life long sufferer of constipation you need to nip this in the bud right now or it will ruin the kid for life. \n\nI seriously recommend **D-Mannose supplements** and Senna complex (temporarily). I take a basic dose every day and I finally have my life back.\n\nEDIT 2: I want to cover some things I responded to other people. \n\n**D mannose** is a naturally occurring sugar found in fruits, it is not a laxative and it is not used metabolically. Mannose sugars are used in cell regulation, protein folding, as a marker in cells, etc. It stimulates the intestines in a different way without causing cramping and has helped me and many others I've met with a wide variety of intestinal issues. I've met people who were wheelchair bound who said they couldn't live without it, and I've met people who were athletic and active (as I am) who found it helped them too.\n\nI do not recommend senna for most people in the long term, but I've had serious chronic constipation for years and take a low dose daily to help keep things soft. \n\nI have been an active and healthy individual for my entire life, nearly every job I've had was outdoors or traveling. I've done every single recommendation by doctors, specialists, friends, that one old lady down the street, etc. I have suffered since I was in diapers. No! Water, fiber, and yoga isn't the solution for everyone! I'm giving a parent a possible solution that my parents couldn't give me.

            "This is Poop Knife 2021",
            "I was a clinic nurse and regularly worked in the colorectal ( butt stuff) clinic. Fun jobs before lunch!!! \nSo  if the doctors suggested to the patient that they need to do a stool/shit sample and bring it back to hand in to our clinic. So my job was to hand over the take home shit collection kit which included a big brown paper bag, a disposable toilet bowl to collect the poop, a little test tube with a scoop to fill the tube with poop and finally the paperwork with baggie attached that they pop the poop test tube in ( THIS IS THE ONLY PART THAT SHOULD COME BACK TO US). I explain it all very clear and I have to do this  about 20 times in each clinic so I\u2019m well versed in the procedure. \n\nSo on this particular day I\u2019m working an ENT clinic and I\u2019m walking past a patient who was very gingerly carrying the large paper bag poop kit. \n\nI suddenly realised what he\u2019s done. But he\u2019s heading towards our head nurse who wasn\u2019t very nice. So I\u2019m watching her face as in slow motion she realised what she\u2019s just been carefully handed. \nTurns out he not only pooped but had a little pee at the same time into the disposable toilet bowl. Didn\u2019t bother with the rest of the instructions and stuck the bowl into the brown bag. Got on a bus ( God bless those poor passengers sitting on that bus on a hot day too). Then walk through the hospital to hand it back in. \n\nNasty nurse thanks the patient and tells him to call for his results in 2 weeks, then carries it into the small testing and waste disposal room white as a sheet. We all disappeared so she couldn\u2019t pass the buck, so she had to scoop the sloppy poop into the test tube herself. \n\nOmg I have never laughed so much in my life. At lunch time we all laughed so much about it until nasty head nurse came into the break room with a face like thunder.\n\nEvery time I hear that Kanye West song \u201cPOOPITY SCOOP, SCOOPITY WOOP ... reminds me of that poop day.",

            "Gotta go back about 25 years.\n\nIt was my very first rodeo with magnesium citrate.\n\nMy eldest son was just a little kid in diapers.  Right about potty training age but special needs so still in diapers at the time.  He was a big time poop holder.\n\n The doctor prescribed stool softeners and when those didn't do the trick he told us to use the MC.  So we did.   And nothing.  For hours and hours, nothing.  We chalked it up as another failure.\n\nThe next day we were headed out to the extended family get together.  I cannot recall if it was Easter or Thanksgiving.  I want to say Thanksgiving.  Anyway, we load up in the car and head out.  The child is strapped into his car seat in the backseat.  We got about 30 minutes outside of town when we heard it.  The low, bubbly, rumble of his gut followed by the longest, loudest \"fart\" I had heard in my life to that point.\n\nMy then husband and I lock eyes and are then hit by the eye watering stench.  He pulls the car over and I go back to assess the situation.\n\nIt's a quiet country road. I unstrap the kiddo from the seat, thinking I may have to do a roadside diaper change.  No big deal.  Done tons of those.\n\nI go to pick him up and his shirt, which had been tucked neatly into his pants, \"squishes\".\n\nI look down the collar of his shirt to see he not only filled the diaper, but all the way up the back of his shirt almost to his armpits. \n\nI had normal diaper supplies but they were not going to be any match for this situation.  We had to go home and give him a bath and call the family and let them know we couldn't make it.",

She clogs our toilet almost everytime. \n\nI don\u2019t agree with giving my kids laxatives every day, or too much of any medicine for that matter, but for the LOVE OF ALL THINGS HOLY I NEED THIS CHILD TO START POOPING LIKE A NORMAL HUMAN ON A REGULAR BASIS.

How???\u201d  My brother has 4 kids now and I think he now has a better understanding of how much poop a kid can store inside their body.",
            "I used to work at a day school in the two year old classroom, it was also the potty training classroom. One of the little girls in my class was afraid of pooping and it got so bad she would scream and cry every time we wanted her to sit on the potty. I worked a lot with her trying to get her to poop and I tried absolutely everything. The director of the school told me about a trick to help get the kids to relax enough to let the poop out. It\u2019s a fun game you can do while they\u2019re on the toilet and I feel like I should share it for anyone that doesn\u2019t know! You just need a feather and a piece of paper or literally anything that\u2019s flat. You put the feather at one end of the paper and have the kids blow the feather off of the paper. I used to always try to catch the feather on the paper and it made her laugh a lot and it was fun for me too! You do this for as long as you want to and it helps get their minds off of being scared about pooping. Every time that we did this she would poop and she would get so excited! This was all before covid so after she pooped I would walk her around the school because she wanted to tell every teacher in the school that she pooped on the potty!! After a few weeks of doing this she wasn\u2019t afraid of pooping anymore and it became exciting and we didn\u2019t need the feather game all the time anymore. Then after a month or two she was fully potty trained and loved pooping on the potty and I was so proud I almost cried. So I highly recommend trying this if you child is afraid of pooping! It was fun for her and it was fun for me! \n\nWhile writing the top part I remembered the worst poop I have ever had to deal with... the same little girl, before trying the feather game, had to take laxatives every day at lunch to help her poop. One day after nap time she said she wasn\u2019t feeling good so I gave her some cuddles but I had to help with the other kids so she just wanted to lay on the floor with her blanket and stuffed animal. After about 5 minutes the room started to smell soooooo bad so I went up to her and asked her if she pooped her pants. She told me that she did so I had her stand up and my jaw instantly dropped to the floor. The poop was completely liquid and since she was laying on her side on the floor it was all over her and the floor. It was PJ day so she was in a onesie and there was so much poop on her that it leaked through her PJ\u2019s onto the floor. My co-teacher and I would switch off on poops and it was my turn and I just wanted to die. In the school we had a small closet in the hallway (this hallway was so small, two people could barely stand next to each other. Just remember that lol) The closet had a shelf on the middle of it where we kept cleaning supplies and below it was where we kept our mop. It was almost like a small shower but it had a really small hose hanging from the shelf. I cleaned and sanitized the mop closet and the put her in there, put on gloves and a paint smok (to protect me and my clothes) and started washing her off. The poop smell filled the entire school and it was the worst poop smell I have ever smelled in my life. Parents started picking up their kids and had to try to squeeze past me while I\u2019m giving this little girl a shower in the hallway, they all had their shirts over their noses to hide from the smell. Right as I finished up her mom came to pick her up and felt so bad for me. The next day she gave me a Starbucks gift card because the smell was so bad. \n\nSorry I had two really long stories about poop but I had to share lol",

I gave myself a stomach cramp laugh-reading it out loud to my husband, who is more concerned with how that even managed to exist inside a 3 year old in the first place.",
            "Oh man.  When our son was little he had bathroom issues.  We had him to the pediatrician several times and they finally sent us to a doctor at Lebonheur Children\u2019s Hospital in Memphis TN.  He was a baby at this point and the doctor examined him and said that his rectum was too small.  He didn\u2019t give us any clue of what he was going to do.  He turned away from us where we couldn\u2019t see, lubed up a pinky finger and inserted it.  That poor baby screamed something terrible.  It was a panicked scream.  I was actually ready to beat the shit out of the doctor.  I was crying and shaking.  He acted like he didn\u2019t understand what I was upset about and said that it needed to be done.  He needed to handle that differently.  I would never recommend him to anyone.  \n\nAnyway, following that horrific day, he was put on Miralax for a few years.  He had a very real fear of pooping, up through probably 4 years old.  He would panic every single time he would have to go.  He would do the clenching up and try to hold it in also.  He then developed a fear of public bathrooms.  Then it went to fear of the drains in the middle of floors like they have in bathrooms.  It went on for a fairly long time.  \n\nI finally started trying to make the actual poops themselves a neat thing.  Like he was making big snakes and things.  So we could tell daddy about the really big snake he made.  And call Nana and tell her all about the huge snake he made all by himself.  We would look at it and talk about the poops and how good they were and stuff.  It\u2019s really weird looking back at it now.  But at the time I was doing the best I could.  \n\nAdding a light-hearted ending to the story.  We had gone to eat at a Luby\u2019s Cafeteria with my aunt and cousin at lunch on a Saturday.  It was packed in there.  He needed to poop so we went to the bathroom and he was successful.  He came out of the bathroom area into the restaurant and loudly and proudly proclaimed, \u201cI made a big snake!\u201d.  He was smiling ear to ear.  A few people snickered and it was just cute.",

We mixed it in to nearly every drink she had (milk, juice). Encourage her to drink water.  Fiber bars as well.  Those were a bit easier,  as they tasted good.  Fiber bars can be pricey,  but if you have an Aldi's near you,  buy them there.  They contain more fiber, seemed to taste a bit better & were significantly cheaper than what we found at other grocery stores.  Finally,  get a squatty potty.  Those things really do help.  \n\nGood luck to you.",

        "selftext": "12 hours before my first \u201cgrown up job\u201d interview, I was sent a drug test permission form which stated it was to be done on company\u2019s grounds. Considering I smoke weed daily I started looking up ways to pass a drug test. I came to the conclusion that I was going to need some clean pee, a small container, and a way to keep it body temperature. I had clean pee and an off brand 5 hour energy bottle (they\u2019re just a tad wider) but needed temperature strips to monitor the temperature. \n\nUnfortunately I was unable to obtain any temperature strips in the time I had to prepare, but knowing that I wouldn\u2019t be able to pass if the temperature wasn\u2019t correct I had the idea to stick it up my vagina. I tested it the night before and even tied a string to it so I could pull it out with ease and everything worked great.\n\nFast forward to the interview.\nIt was an hour and a half away so I decided to wait till I got there to insert it. I did it in my car w some coconut oil before I walked in just Incase they decided to drug test me first. I walked in and everything was fine, I signed in and they told me to take a seat. As soon as I sat down I knew something was wrong. I went to the bathroom to make sure I could still take it out. I began pulling on the strings but the bottle didn\u2019t move. I tugged again and the string broke. At this point I\u2019m freaking out. I try getting it out with my fingers but I can\u2019t reach it. The only \u201ctools\u201d I have on me are a mechanical pencil and a pen. So in a 3 piece suit and heels, I squat and begin to use these \u201ctools\u201d to try and remove the bottle. About 4 min go by and I\u2019m really freaking out but need to go back Incase they called my name. I walk out and the HR rep sees me and asks if I\u2019m okay. I tell her I have a tampon stuck up my vagina that I can\u2019t get out and that\u2019s why I\u2019m freaking out. She then takes me to the nurse and tells me that hey she can remove it for me! Not wanting the target nurse to pull a bottle of pee out of me, I ask her if I can just try again myself, she says sure and hands me tweezers. Obviously that didn\u2019t work. So she then gives me these scissors with a hook at the end and a disinfectant wipe... Still didn\u2019t work. At this point I just have to do the interview. It lasted 3 hours and I had to take a tour of a 900,000 sq ft distribution center. \n\nWhen the interview finally ends I rush to the closest urgent care where I have to explain to the doctors why there\u2019s a 5 hour energy in my vagina. At this point I\u2019m convinced I just don\u2019t have the right tools and they\u2019ll get it out in no time. Upon looking, the doctor informs me that not only is it lodged behind my pelvic bone, but that it\u2019s also sideways. Her first idea is to drill a hole into the bottle IN MY VAGINA and then fish it out. ~Luckily~ they just sent me to the ER instead. \n\nSo now I\u2019m at the ER where they then inform me that since it\u2019s behind my pelvic bone getting it out would mean essentially birthing a 5 hour energy bottle, but since I wasn\u2019t actually giving birth my body wasn\u2019t dilated and they couldn\u2019t remove the bottle without putting me under.  \n\nWell, after 8 hours of having a 5 hour energy bottle lodged in my person, it was finally removed.\nI didn\u2019t get the job and I didn\u2019t even get drug tested. \n\nTLDR: tried to pass a drug test by sticking a 5 hour energy bottle filled w clean pee in my vagina. After 8 hours, an urgent care visit, and a trip to the ER it was finally removed\n\nEdit: this isn\u2019t made up. Idk if I have all the \u201canatomy\u201d right I guess? Yes it was very painful. Yes, I have pictures and medical paperwork for people who don\u2019t believe me\n\nI\u2019m just telling you guys what the doctors told me.

            "To anyone that reads this: I been passing drug tests for my entire adult life. The ones they do for jobs rarely watch you and will just ask you to empty your pockets at best before you go into the bathroom. Their temperature thing isn't an exact science in my experience so the temp doesn't have to be perfect. \n\nMy method: fill a condom (i always used magnums because they are bigger and stronger) up with pee and just leave it somewhere warm until you gotta go in. I used to put it on the dashboard of my car during the summer or just turn the heater on full blast and put it in front of it during the winter. Then wear some boxer briefs and secure it with a safety pin to the tied off part of the condom. The safety pin is also for piercing the condom when you need to fill their bottle thing. \n\nBit of warning: magnum condoms are tough to poke through. I tried once with a paper clip and ended up spraying the wall of the bathroom with pee. Still passed the drug test even though I had the pee soaked condom in my pocket clearly. Drug test lab techs really don't give a fuck as long as you give them a bottle of pee. \n\nAlternatively as long as you got at least 7 days before your test you can just stop smoking and drink a ton of water before and usually pass no problem. Just drink til you pee every 15 minutes or so and it's completely clear. Never had a problem with dilution detected in the test. I once passed after smoking weed 2 days before the test.",

She tells me its $40 for some videos and her venmo and I decide, fuck it, I'd like to see some of that.\n\nAfter sending her the money, she proceeds to send me the videos, (pretty nice btw) and she asks what I think of them. I tell her she looks very sexy and she then sends me a message \"I'm kinda new to this. Tips are really appreciated.\"\n\nSo I took this as \"Oh, she's new to selling her body on the internet, I should be constructive and try to help a new entrepreneur.\"\n\nI then proceed to spend the next 10 minutes going over her good points, things I think she could improve, specifically things like, \"You have really nice boobs, but I think you're overemphasizing them.

        "selftext": "First, English is not my first language and this shameful moment happened a while ago at University in France.\n\nMy professor was a prominent teacher in a specific science area. From his look and what he told us about his personal life, you could guess he was a very religious family guy, quite inhibited, and definitely not the kind of making jokes.\n\nDuring his classes, students were used to prepare talks about specific topics or to send him reports. So part of our homework had to be written while the other part had to be oral.\n\nSo that day, he introduced a new project that we\u2019ll have to prepare for the following week. But he didn\u2019t specify which kind. So the ~~stupid~~ naive younger version of myself genuinely asked him:\n\n**Me -** \"Excusez-moi Professeur X, voulez-vous un rapport \u00e9crit ou un rapport oral?\" *-->* Translation **COULD mean**: \"Excuse-me Professor X, would you like a written report or an oral report?\" (*Nothing crazy, huh? but definitely not what everyone understood. Real meaning further in the text)*\n\n**Prof X -** *staying silent and starting to blush*\n\n**The whole classroom -**  *bursting and laughing so much*\n\n**Me -** *turning around to my classmates confused to see what funny thing I missed then going back to my professor* \"Mr X, you didn't answer to my question. Would you like an oral report?\"\n\n**Prof X -** *still silent and blushing even more* \n\n**The whole classroom -**  l*aughing louder*\n\n**Me -** *More and more confused of what was so hilarious then I repeat in my mind the question I was about to ask once again because damnit I want to know what freaking kind of project he was asking us! And this is when I realize what terrible thing I've just said out loud. I was so ashamed that I instantly got the same skin condition as my professor. But it  was so funny that I ended up crying from laughing.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**THE EXPLANATION:**\n\n\"Rapport \u00e9crit\" means \"written report\" and by opposition \"Rapport oral\" would literally mean \"oral report\" ONLY if you translate word by word.\n\nBut in French, the real common comprehension for \"rapport oral\" is BLOWJOB and that's what EVERYONE understood!!! \n\nNo you can re-read my conversation and replace oral report by blowjob. \n\nYes you can make fun of me, I deserve it! \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:** During class, I thought I was asking to my teacher what kind of homework we had to do but instead I asked him if he wanted a blowjob.",

This happened to me in high school at an emersion weekend where my German class met up with other German classes and had a whole weekend speaking in, well, German.\n\nIt was very muggy and hot the whole weekend and I was still in a phase where I'd wear pants all the time. Naturally, people would ask me how I am doing and I would typically respond as normal and add, \"Ich bin heisse,\"  just to say to people that I was warm.\n\nIt wasn't until the final morning where we all gather for breakfast. I'm sitting near my teacher (Frau), the camp counselors, and my classmates and we get to chatting. Frau eventually gets to me and asks how I am and I just say plainly, \"Ich bin heisse.\" She stops dead cold and says in ENGLISH, \"Klaus! You cannot say that -- you're telling people you are...horny.\" \n\nMy entire table erupted. Turns out a few of my classmates knew what I was saying the whole time.

            "This happens a lot in languages. In Indonesian, the word 'malu' means shy, but adding the prefix and suffix ke-an to the word turns it into a term for genitals. \n\nThe ke-an combination typically makes a root word into a verb, so someone new to the language could be forgiven assuming 'kemaluan' would mean shyness. A word not uncommonly used if you're using a language a trying to speak... \n\nSo if someone were to say for example \"minta maaf atas kemaluan saya\", they may assume they're saying \"forgive my shyness\" when in fact, if male, they're saying \"forgive my penis\".",

Some of the stories involved like, going on a boring date to a carnival with Channing Tatum, only to fall off the Ferris wheel and be saved by super man. \n\nAnyway I wrote a story about a man who robbed an old woman, including all the cabbages in her garden. She happened to know karate, and beat him up and sent him home. Soon after, she found that new cabbages had been planted in her garden and a note slipped through her door apologizing and saying to enjoy the cabbages. \n\nAfter reading, my teacher called me to her desk and informed me through tears of laughter that the word I used for \u201cenjoy\u201d - \u201cjouir\u201d didn\u2019t mean to enjoy in that sense.

I don't see my therapist again until Friday, so you get to hear about it instead.\n\nI work in a customer-facing position in a small office. Today\u2019s just a regular Monday. Talking to customers, preparing their work orders, finishing their paperwork, all sorts of small stuff. At time being, I have three customers sitting in my waiting area.\n\nThe most recent addition to our quiet morning waiting room, we\u2019ll call her Jan, has been here before. Or rather, her family has a customer history with us - it\u2019s my first time meeting her. The name on their account is Hank Junts and I feel like I\u2019ve met him before. I *know* that I've met him before. I browse through their history and they have extensive records, but for the life of me I cannot place his face.\n\nAfter about ten minutes of idle clicking, I decide to search his name on Google with the name of our city.\n\n>\u201cBeloved Softball Coach Hank Junts passes away in tragic fire.\u201d \n\nHeadline from a local news station.\n\n*Oh my god. Maybe that\u2019s why I\u2019ve never met her before. Maybe he always came in instead of her.*\n\nThe article is dated December of last year.\n\n*Jeeze, it probably has been that long since I've seen him, hasn\u2019t it. Oh how tragic.* Jan is probably only in her 40s or so. \n\nI wonder if I should say anything.\n\nBut I don\u2019t have to say anything. I would credit Satan with the creation of auto-play videos on news articles, but Satan never did anything so heinous.\n\n**In tragic news, Hank Junts, softball coach at Smith Middle School, passed away as a result of a house fire last night.**\n\nAt full volume - echoing through the small room like a bird that got trapped inside, bouncing and flitting around uncatchable. I cannot catch it. The bird has knocked a vase onto Mrs. Junts\u2019 head. The bird has knocked me on my ass. There is a bird in my throat and it feels like my mouth is full of feathers.\n\n*oh my god oh my god oh my god.*\n\n**no no no.**\n\nI frantically scroll trying to find the video player. Fuck. Found it. Pause pause pause pause pause you piece of shit.\n\n*Oh yeah, that\u2019s what he looks like.*\n\nJan looks up at me. I look up at Jan. The Earth crackles and groans as the floor beneath me opens and swallows me whole.\n\nNo, I\u2019m not that lucky. I stammer something about being so sorry for her loss and run to the break room, where I now sit red-faced and horrified. I can hear her on her cell phone. She is crying. I am crying. I fucked up and just ruined my customer's day and have a new addition to the file of Horrible Things To Think About Right As I Fall Asleep.\n\ntldr: Couldn\u2019t remember what a customer looked like, wound up with a news clip loudly autoplaying how the customer died in a house fire - and I played it all of ten feet from his widow.\n\n--\n\nedit: okay I hate edits but now I understand why people do them. our FAQ of the day - no, my keyboard unfortunately does not have a volume button and I do try to keep my computer on mute. for what it's worth (i.e. not much at this fuckin point), the only reason it wasn't muted was because I was showing someone a coworker a video while we were opening. and yes, I probably shouldn't have done that either. \n\nthere's a lot of love/hate about the bird thing. thank you for the compliments. if you said something mean I hope a real life non-metaphorical bird poops right on your head.\n\nas far as what I'm going to do next. Mrs. Junts is coming back into the office next Monday so I'm planning on talking to her in person then. thankfully I have a some days to practice because tbh, even though logically I know it was an innocent mistake, it still feels awful and it's hard to think about facing her. my coworker said she seemed okay when she left. and yes, I know that it was probably a mistake to run away but if I had any good judgement about any of this I wouldn't have a reason to post here in the first place.\n\nadding another edit because my selfloathing knows no bounds.

        "selftext": "This happened two days ago, and though the consequences of said FU have subsided, the lessons I learned along the way will stay with me, forever.\n\nI love bad food, and therefore have to run in order to eat said food without ballooning to immense proportions. On Saturday, I decided to do a long-ish run, as I was going out for my daughter's birthday, and her favorite restaurant is an all-you-can-eat place nearby our house. So, donning my cold-weather outdoor running gear, I set off on a jog, noticing that I had forgot to put on the compression underwear that I normally run with. No matter, I thought-I had sweats on and even though it was ~28 F, I was warm enough and knew that I would warm up after I started on the run.\n\nAbout halfway through I had to pee, but it subsided after about 5-6 minutes, so I figured my body just said \"eh take care of it when you get home.\" About ten minutes after that, I realized I could no longer feel much down there, and the tip of my penis was completely without feeling. Worrisome, I thought, so I turned my back to the road, took off my glove, and put my hands down there to investigate. It was cold as ice, and I couldn't feel anything. Turns out, not wearing underpants had made the tip of the penis spend most of its time in direct contact with my sweats, which weren't rated to any sort of weather conditions (they were just my usual ratty lounge pants). So, between the sweat from the warm parts of my legs and the tip of the penis being essentially uncovered to the elements...\n\nI ran back to the house as fast as I could, all the while worrying that at some point that day, I would see a doctor, who would pull down his mask, use words like \"frostbite,\" \"amputation,\" and \"shockingly small,\" and I would have no choice but to be a eunuch. Once I got home, I stripped down and got into the bathroom to take a warm shower (I probably should have looked up the proper way to go about unfreezing a penis, but my mind was elsewhere). I cannot really describe the intense pain that ensued as my penis thawed, but I thought I was going to pass out. It took roughly an hour (the worst part of which was the first 5 or so minutes) to get \"normal\" feeling back, and as far as I can tell, everything is working properly as of now.\n\nStill, the moral of the story- WEAR UNDERPANTS. They might just save your penis (if you have one).\n\nTL:DR went for a run in below-freezing weather, forgot to wear underpants, froze penis, had to re-thaw penis and it was exceptionally painful.\n\nEdit: I am so happy that my (possibly small) frozen penis is making some internet friends have a good laugh. Thanks for reading! And thank you, truly, for the gold and silver, I am honored that it made a few folks chuckle enough to go the extra mile. Stay safe out there, and keep your junk warm if you have it!\n\nEdit edit: It's the squiggly line, not a minus sign, in front of the 28F. So, it was JUST below freezing, not 28 degrees below freezing. I don't mind running in the cold, but 28 below would be truly insane.",

Or That's terrible your mom raised someone else's kids and worst of all someone comparing you guys to lost investments.

Family is what you make it not who's genes are in you.   \n\n\nSecondly \n\nThis changes nothing between you your mom and your twin. She is still your mom, She carried you to term labored through the birth and raised you up. From reading your stories it seems like your mother was a pretty good mom who cared for you. and after this i certainly hope that doesn't change.   \n\n\nLastly\n\nIf your mothers nerves with the migrains and such dont get better or if she needs help getting around this idea that genetically your not hers. I would recommend getting in touch with the IVF place and find out if there is a group to talk to and i would highly recomend she talk to a father or two who have had to use someone elses sperm to have a kid. I dont know if there would be many others who would be better to talk to then someone who new from day one their kid was never genetically theirs. ",

I have a great pregnancy baby is doing great then placental abruption no heart beat, he is born and All I could do was cry that I was going to lose my one chance of having my own child. They get him straitened out, close me up, explain what happened and I just dont care anymore who is the biological father. Fast forward to my oldest son (blessed with 3 boys) at 17 wants to know.  I narrow it down send him certified letter ect ask if he would do DNA, he did, and he is not the father. Son drops issue. He was adopted by my husband (and father of my other 2 sons) at 31/2 he's 25 now he's come to the conclusion that now doesn't matter. So while I was no angel he knows all the facts of what my life was at that time, he doesn't judge me and it is no secret that I dont know.

At the time of my Reddit post, the charity\u2019s latest campaign had approximately $12,500 from 26 total donations.  My neighbor, the organizer of the charity, had told me the charity was running on fumes and looking to cancel some of its programs.  \n\nOf course I had hoped some Redditors might read my story and decide to help the charity, but I NEVER could have expected the overwhelming reaction nor the incredible generosity of the Reddit community.  \u201cWatch this post blow up, and a shit ton of Redditors donate\u201d was one of the first comments the post received on Reddit.  And that is exactly what happened.  Over Memorial Day Weekend, the charity raised over $55,000 from over 2,100 new donations.  \n\nOn Saturday, I had to explain Reddit to my 77-year-old neighbor and to the charity\u2019s team leader in Bangladesh (he called it Rebbit, as you can see in my pics).  They were absolutely blown away by the reaction \u2013 truly they view it as a miracle.  I received the following message from my neighbor: \u201cWithout a doubt, this is the biggest wave of support to arrive since we started! Doors that were closed can now be opened. Plans that were parked can now be put in motion. There is much we can now accomplish. All due to your idea to post (in a funny way) on what happened a while ago.  Abundant resources require an equal level of responsibility. No less. I am committed to see that these funds are applied carefully and continue to make a difference to those who need it most.\u201d\n\nSometimes things just seem to work out for a reason.  One Reddit donor commented, \u201cMichael may have screwed up his donation, but hopefully his TIFU on Reddit has fixed that somewhat.\u201d  Thanks to Reddit, the Bangladesh community will receive roughly 4x the amount of the original donation I had refunded.  \n\nTL;DR: My embarrassing story of an accidental $15,041 donation (and refund of $13,541) goes viral on Reddit, Redditors raise over $55,000 for needy in Bangladesh!\n\nEDIT:  Holy cow someone just donated $5,000!  Thank you, Anonymous!!  Hopefully you didn\u2019t mean to donate $500\u2026 it could happen to anyone.  Charity link in comments and original post, if anyone else is interested!",

(And vice versa.)  Years ago, with a child on the way, I was told I didn't meet a requirement for my job and I had a month to quit or be fired, take my pick.  That was bad.  In that month, I was told of another position elsewhere.  I applied, got it, and basically never missed a paycheck.  I've been with that organization for 20+ years and have moved up into my current position.\n\nEven really \"bad\" things -- car accidents, house fires, whatever -- can be \"good\" in the long run, depending on the fallout.  Sometimes bad things are just bad things, and that's all there is to it.  But sometimes, they're the catalyst for something good.  We just can't see it right away.",

I just want to put things into perspective for you guys. Here are some stats according to the most trustworthy news source in Bangladesh:  \nThe average monthly income for a single person of our country is $250.  \nIn rural areas its $130 for a family of 4.  \nThe average spent on food for a single person of our country is $50.  \nIn rural areas its $30 for a family of 4.  \nSo, with $55000 we can feed almost 7400 people for a month. (just with stats, in real life it will be more with bulk buying driving down costs).  \nThe average is larger because most of the people live in the capital where everything is more expensive. But the rural areas are much cheaper but people earn less too.",

I got here yesterday, got some work done on my latest project, and decided to end the day with a nice relaxing soak in the whirlpool tub. I wiped the tub down, filled it with piping hot water, added salts and a few drops of essential oils. I lit candles and poured a glass of champagne. It was beautiful. I lowered myself into the tub slowly, sank down, and sighed in happiness. Then I turn on the jets to kick everything off. I learned back, and for a few brief moments, I was in heaven. Then I opened my eyes. There were black slugs swimming in my bath. Hundreds of them. It was horrifying. I screamed like a banshee and dove out of the tub, falling to the floor. In my panic I knocked the wine glass off the tub ledge, shattering it. Now I'm naked on the floor, wet and covered in broken glass. The tub jets are still on, and now spraying the entire room with water. After managing to grip the counter and haul my ass up off the floor, I see that I have little cuts all over my legs, hands, and abdomen. Now the dogs are roused, and they are barking and jumping at the door. I tried to get ahold of myself enough to open the door, but as I do so, the largest dog pushes through, knocking me BACK on to the broken glass, so at this point I now have to do what I can to keep the dogs from getting hurt. After a moment or 2 of total panic, I get the dogs out again. When I look into the tub, I realize there are no slugs, but apparently my ex hasn't cleaned the tub jets in a looooong time, because it is absolutely full of big pieces of the disgusting shit that builds up in tub jets. Big black pieces of that horrid mix of dead skin, oils, bacteria, and other delightful residues. I honestly think slugs might be LESS gross. So instead of relaxing, I spent the night cleaning and picking glass out of my wounds. Oh, and the dogs are fine, btw. \n\nTL;DR...I took a bath in a whirlpool that wasn't as clean as it looked. I saw a thousand gross black slugs things floating around, panicked, dove out of the tub and ended up covered in broken glass and cuts",

I was not aware of this.\n\nAnd the thing with those walk-in tubs... you can't get out until you drain all of the water out of the tub.

The plate went off like a fucking grenade. I jumped back, in case the cockroach decided to try and finish the job, and managed to land on plate fragments. The towel fluttered to the floor.

Hey, when was the last time you cleared the jets? He was dumbfounded. That was a thing? OMG. It took three days of flushes to get them clear. The water shooting out was pure mold and hair.

Like more than normal?\" He said yes because the heel is a very tender area of the body. Let me tell you, he was not lying.

I opted for the latter.\n\nTl;dr I got covid and didn't die and then my underwear fell down in public.\n\nEdit: I am so thankful for all of your covid stories, and high five to my stranger-friends who have also had it and recovered!

Yesterday afternoon they left to go out and I was home alone. I'm usually good for a stroke a day and hadn't had a chance for a few days since they'd been there. When everyone left I decided it would be a good time to break out my silicone jerk sleeve and have some fun. Did the deed and decided to go take a shower and wash it out. I set it down at the back of the tub, finished my shower, dried off and went about my day. Last night about 11:00 my roommate's friend goes and takes a shower. She goes into my roommate's bedroom and I hear muffled commotion. \n\"It's not mine.\" \n\n\"What the fuck is it?\"\"eeewww!\" \n\nAt this moment I knew exactly what happened. I left it on the edge of the tub. There was nothing I could do and I knew I was in for it. I covered my head and waited for then to come to me. A few minutes later I hear them come in and I start getting smacked in the head with my silicone vag and my roommate yelling at me that we have company over.. \nOnce they left my room I got up and took care of putting it away. Then the girls start asking questions...\n\nWhat is it like? Is it like a real vagina? Why do you have it? \nNo, it's not like the real thing, but it's cheaper than a stripper and I don't need to worry about catching anything. \n\nAround this moment her girlfriend realizes that she was touching my sex toy that I blew a load into earlier, and admits to everyone that she fingered it when she found it. \n\n\"Did you throw it out?\"\n\nYes I did.\n\n\"You didn't need to throw it out.\"\n\n\"Well, considering I just got beat with it and it's kinda old it's time for a new one, they tend to get worn out.\" \n\nFor the next hour or so all I could hear was them laughing at my expense in the other room. Hopefully they have gone home by the time I get out of work.\n\nEdit: after seeing this blow up I just want to add that I'm glad it wasn't my butt plug I left out. \nThey left and we're all on good terms. One of the girls never knew pocket pussies existed and spent some time browsing the internet looking at the male sex toy section.\n\nOh, and this is typical of my roommate, we antagonize each other to no end. We've been laughing about it and it's just a matter of time before I get him back.\n\nTldr: left my pocket pussy in the shower and house guest found it while taking a shower.",

We all had a good laugh.\n\nMandatory edit:\n\nThank you for the gold.\n\n\nThank you for the condolences.\n\n\nMy brother\u00b4s phone line is still active, it\u00b4s in a family plan...  I won't be pestering my sister-in-law about this, she is having a hard time already and if this isn\u00b4t a issue for her, I sure won\u00b4t create one.  \n\nTL;DR: Family freaked out thinking my deceased brother was calling them, instead it was my nephew using his phone.

            "My boy friend passed back in 2008. The first night I kept calling his cell phone just to hear his voice on his greeting. A few minutes later I got a call back from his number and nearly had a heart attack. It was his mother. His phone was not on silent and she called back to make sure I was okay. I wasn\u2019t. She said she would turn the phone off, and that way I could just call and hear his voice right away. You never fully recover, but it gets easier day by day! Eventually, you don\u2019t cry at what could have been, but you laugh at the happy memories. \n\nHappy healing! ",

            "Oof. We had something kind of similar happen. My fiancee's younger cousin used to live with us years ago. He rode a motorcycle. One day I'm outside working on my truck, and a State Trooper pulled up in my driveway. I ask if I can help him with something, he starts asking me questions about who I am and who lives in this house. Of course, I immediately go on the defensive, \"this is my house dude, what are *you* doing here?!\" He then starts asking about my fiancee's cousin. I tell him yeah, we know who it is, he used to live here. Thinking he's been arrested again or something. The cop then gets visibily emotional and tells me he needs to speak to my fiancee, her cousin wrecked his motorcycle and died on the scene. My fiancee is destroyed, he was more like a little brother than cousin. So I step up after the cop leaves and start calling *everyone* in her family to tell them he died.\n\nMy brother was actually pretty close to her cousin, so after I call her family, I called my brother. My brother is very confused, he had just spoken to him less than an hour before the cop told us. Well, he must be mistaken because it happened at least 2 hours ago. I tell him that and we get off the phone. About 10 mins later, my brother calls back. HE'S JUST SPOKEN TO THE COUSIN, HE'S ALIVE AND WELL!!! However, he had let his older brother (fiancee's older cousin) use his bike. He didn't have a license, the bike was still registered to my address under the younger cousin's name, so the cops assumed that's who was driving.\n\nI had to call everyone back and tell them \"good news! Cousin A is still alive! Bad news, cousin B died.\" Even worse, my brother had to tell cousin A that *his* brother died on his bike. \n\nOne fucked up night to say the least.",

He was a nice guy.  45yrl who played video games, watched DBZ and such.  45 yrl going on 15 if you asked me.  All day he was either laughing or looking like he was having a heart attack.  He said he couldn't afford to get another job and the boss would basically ask him to stay, work long hours, do all the BS the boss didn't want to do,etc. We all tried to help him get another job that didn't put so much strain on his heart.  He worked there as a shift leader for about 3 years before he finally had a heart attack and died.  \n\nThis post reminded me of him because I still have his Facebook page on my friends list and every year people wish him happy birthday and such.  Last year though our old boss messaged him to see if he wanted to work at BK again.  He has been dead for almost 7 years!

Does that make sense?\n\nIt\u2019s been 10 years this year and Daddy is still in my phone contacts. And my mother still has his old number. I had my sister do the same thing and it worked for us. Maybe an email to your family letting them know the account is still live and to maybe just change the number they have by just 1 number will prevent his contact from showing up if nephew accidentally does that again.

I had been hearing complaints from his Facebook friends that his girlfriend had been posting daily from his page as if she were him, just posts and pictures and memes and shit and it was upsetting people. We aren't friends on Facebook, but I sent him a message and said \"Happy Birthday, I love you \u2764\ufe0f\" I just wanted to leave it there, it made me feel better.

Within a few minutes his name popped up on the screen, calling me back. I answered without thinking and a child, maybe a tween, was on the other end asking why I texted them. I hadn't even considered that someone else might have his number now. It was a bit sad and I feel a little guilty for confusing some poor kid.",

I know you\u2019re scared, but we\u2019ll see each other soon. I love you, mom.\u201d And I was fucking FREAKED. I couldn\u2019t even imagine what that note could have been for, as me and my mom never spent time apart when she was alive. I was spooked and didn\u2019t know what to think, so I showed my dad. Turns out it was a note from an old earthquake kit that was sent to school with me from the previous year. I\u2019m not sure what I was expecting, but I know I was disappointed. It was a wild day.",

My mother was having a rough go of it understandably, so I thought it would be nice to text her and remind her that I loved her. When she got a text saying \u201cI love you\u201d from my father\u2019s phone, it sent her over the top. She became absolutely hysterical, thinking my father was still alive. She wouldn\u2019t accept that it had been me, that I had the phone in my hands. Her friends came over to try to bring her back to reality, but nothing got through to her. Finally, they took her to the hospital as a last resort. That\u2019s probably the biggest FU I\u2019ve ever had, and it devastates me to know that I made that happen.",

I knew she had passed away a couple days before, but then a text popped up from her. It was her mom, making sure I knew. I can\u2019t figure out why her mom did that since she had texted me before from her own phone. My only guess was that she was just texting everyone in the phone to make sure they knew and she must not have been thinking straight about how shocking it would be to see a text from that number.",

I was driving at the time and didn\u2019t get the notification, so I didn\u2019t even see it had happened until later that night. I got super spooked as I was thinking of her especially that day, but it turned out that my grandpa (her husband) got onto her Facebook and just started pushing random buttons (he has no idea how to operate a computer, let alone Facebook).

However, me being in mourning, decided not to change it at the moment. I was still in college at the time, which was four hours away from my hometown and I was visiting my family over the weekend, not too long after she had passed.. My grandmother's room was in our basement, which was where she passed away, and I always felt uncomfortable being there alone. During my visit, our fridge was not working, so my parents had temporarily transferred all our food to my grandmother's fridge. I was planning to bring some food back to school with me, which meant I had to go to my grandmother's room, much to my disliking. I was waiting for a friend to pick me up, so I had my phone in my pocket just in case they had called to let me know he arrived. I'm in my grandmother's room, searching through the fridge for my things. I feel my phone vibrate with a text, and think that it's my friend who's letting me know they're at my house, so I immediately take it out to answer. My heart stopped when I saw the notification from grandmother with the message: Goodbye, loueezay. I quickly ran up the stairs with my food and left my house. Looking back, I know it was definitely my cousin who texted me, since he had the phone, but it still sends shivers down my spine. I definitely changed the contact to my cousin's name after that!",

So that day for some reason her tummy was giving her issues so she was being difficult about eating. It was a cycle of her saying she was hungry, then a little back and forth about what is going to be eaten, and finally her taking one bite and saying she was done. Not even saying there was a problem, literally \"cool this was good, I'm full for the next 3 minutes\".\n\nAfter applesauce, PB & J, and pasta being prepared for no reason, I got the third \"all done!\" 30 seconds after dropping the plate with her, and I got a little frustrated.\n\nReal quick side note, I try to not give my daughter too much of the \"baby talk\" as in I don't like having to dumb things down if it's unnecessary, especially because I'm bilingual so there's a whole other layer of development that I gotta be mindful of when I freely swap languages. So I try to keep it fairly down to earth if I can, to help her in the long run, unless we are playing or some other situation where I would be in character.\n\nANYWAY... So I'm a little frustrated and I'm in casual mode so after the third failed meal I slip up and I go \"oh come on man, are you fucking with me?\" And without missing a beat she goes \"no. I'm not fucking with you.\" and it just kinda stopped me in my tracks lol it was supposed more of a comment I mumbled to myself, but she fed it right back to me and I kinda wanted to laugh but also kinda felt embarrassed for it, while also having to   let her know that I'd prefer if she didn't say that for reasons. \n\nYeah I know, it's not all that crazy, but I thought it was kinda noteworthy one way or another and couldn't think of a better sub to share it on.\n\nEdit: this blew up, holy shit, I was just casually sharing a story, didn't think it would get this popular.

Ours has become stretched after years of eating incorrectly. We laern to eat when bored, sad, socially, etc. You are cooking as if you were a cooking for an adult and expecting them to eat a full meal. The reason many of us are overweight as adults and teens is because our parents would make us eat an entire plate of food well after we were full or if we were not hungry. \n\n\nBy default we don't  need to eat on a certain schedule or certain amounts.

        "selftext": ">TL;Dr: My Fianc\u00e9 bought 60mg peach rings, I woke up at around midnight with a sweet tooth, and ate two of them in a disoriented sleepy state. I had not ever done marijuana until that point, and I got very, very high.\n\nSo, My fianc\u00e9 of two years is a marijuana consumer, she enjoys a good buzz after work, and I enjoy a glass of whiskey and a cigar once a month, that\u2019s just the way we are, she\u2019s happy, I\u2019m happy.\n\nShe had always wanted to get me stoned since our first date, since I had never tried marijuana, and I had always promised that our wedding night would be our first time getting high together.\n\nI include this information, because I feel I need to emphasize how unprepared my body was for what happened to me.\n\nYesterday, I got out of the hospital due to COVID complications, I am feeling about 80% normal I\u2019d say, congested, but normal, and I felt extremely exhausted, so I went to our bedroom and crashed out. \n\nWhen I awoke, the thirst in my mouth was sandy, and the heat from my body seemed almost leeched entirely into the bed. So I got up, and looked at my phone, as you do, and I see that it\u2019s around 11:30 pm. I walk into my kitchen, and I get myself a giant glass of cold water. My fianc\u00e9 is on video calls with her friends in the living room, foggy smoke fills the air. \n\nShe has Oreos by her, but I am balls out naked, and if I were to go, her webcam would surely capture the shmeat and broadcast it to four women and a flamboyantly gay man enjoying their night. \n\nBut I\u2019m sleepy and I want sweets\n\nSo in my stupor, I open the snack cupboard, and grab... peach rings, that\u2019s all the bag says on the top, (brand)Peach Rings. \n\nI popped one in my mouth, and grabbed two more, and put the baggy back in the cabinet, and scuttled off, but after the second peach ring, the aftertaste was bitter, I figured they were just sugar free, but because I have a mild allergic reaction to some sweeteners, I decided to go back to read the ingredients on the back of the package:\n\nOn the FRONT OF THE BAG it actually says (brand) THC INFUSED peach rings, 60 mg... my initial thoughts weren\u2019t so abnormal, 60 mg sounds like nothing, like if I took a 60 mg ibuprofen that would barely be any ibuprofen, right? So my logic was that it would be like taking almost nothing\n\nSo I called my fianc\u00e9 into the room with me, and I told her what happened, she told me to eat something right away, she ended up warming me up some Chef Boyardee Ravioli, and sat me down at our dining table, and I pulled out my phone to watch something. \n\nBetween bites of nuclear tomato sauce and super-processed meat filled pasta, I picked up my phone and went to type \u201cking of the hill\u201d on Hulu. \n\nI got three letters in and suddenly it felt like I had just had my hand in the snow, you know that numb sensation that makes you feel like your hand is a lot fatter or wider than it is? I couldn\u2019t muster the dexterity to type anymore\n\nThen I looked over to my fianc\u00e9, and it was like a laggy video game, I moved, but my vision didn\u2019t keep up with my movement, like 30 seconds later I was mentally where my body was. \n\nI could only say what I felt in that moment, a long and whispery \u201cNoooooooooooo~\u201d\n\nThat got the attention of my lover, who looked at me and said \u201chow does your nose feel\u201d, which cued me to touch my nose, it felt like it was feet away from my eyes. \n\n>From here, my memory gets spotty, but here\u2019s how I remember the rest of the night: \n\nThe time on my phone was now 12:45 am\n\nmy fianc\u00e9 tells me to finish my food, and I did, but every bite felt it was minutes long\n\nWhen I ate all of my ravioli, I said I wanted to go to bed\n\nSuddenly- I am in bed and I look at my phone, it\u2019s 12:50, this upset me, I remember trying to reason with my feelings, because I felt like it should have been much later\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 comes into the bedroom, I ask her how I got there\n\nShe laughs\n\nI blink\n\nShe\u2019s gone\n\nI call for her\n\nShe\u2019s next to the bed now, and I get an overwhelming sense of dread in my gut and chest, everything is spinning \n\nShe tells me I\u2019ll be okay, and touches my head\n\nIn close my eyes for what feels like a long while, I open them, \n\nShe\u2019s still in the same position, over me, playing with my hair.\n\nIt\u2019s 1:15 am, and I am relatively lucid, and paranoia is just barely getting his Dick lubed up for me \n\nAt some point I wanted to cuddle with my woman, because I felt like I was somewhat safe when we were closely embraced.\n\n>from this point forward this is what she says happened \n\n\u201cYou wanted me to cuddle but your fever was so hot I couldn\u2019t just spoon you in good conscience, but you tucked your face into my neck and the rest of your body was diagonal across the bed\u201d\n\n\u201cYou asked how long the feeling would last, I told you that you weren\u2019t even at your peak yet, and you cried, which is so not you, you don\u2019t cry, which got me panicked\u201d \n\n\u201cYou asked me to read the back of the package to you, and when I got up to go get it, you stopped me and asked me where I was going, when I told you, you said okay, then when I got back, you asked me where I went\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said thank you for the macaroni about 10 times, and I said you\u2019re welcome, but then I asked /what macaroni/ your final time, which made you talk about how they don\u2019t eat meat sauce on their spaghetti in Italy\u201d \n\n\u201cYou told me that if you died of Rona, that you didn\u2019t want me to tell your mom and dad you did weed\u201d \n\n\u201cYou asked me to read a Wikipedia article about how to stop a weed overdose, which I couldn\u2019t find because it doesn\u2019t exist\u201d\n\n\u201cI made you chew on black peppercorns, because it makes some people sober up, but you just kept saying you couldn\u2019t taste it\u201d\n\n\u201cAt about 2-2:30 am, you just kept asking me how long it had been every 2-5 minutes, then you fell asleep, and you\u2019d wake up and then wake me up periodically to tell me you think it\u2019s going away\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s how it went for an few hours\n\n>things I apparently hallucinated while awake and did not dream like I thought I did\n\nThe bed filling with water like a waterbed\n\nMy sisters coming over but hiding from me\n\nMy phone ringing\n\nThe window (second story) being tapped on \n\nMy dad coming in the room and saying things to me like \u201cI\u2019m disappointed in you\u201d\n\nThe room moving in twisty ways, or like I was floating on a boat\n\n>in conclusion \n\nIt\u2019s now been 16 hours and I still feel a little off\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 says there are things she won\u2019t tell me about my time on my trip, things she wants to keep to herself, she says they aren\u2019t about her or me, but she thinks that they are a big part of who I am, and that she loves me even more because, she says she has seen my realest self\n\nAlso, I was in hysterics at a few points in the night, and she doesn\u2019t want me to feel too embarrassed\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nEdit: This will be my only edit,  firstly, thank you for everyone that gave an award, the most I\u2019ve ever gotten in my life. \n\nSecondly, \n\nI cannot express my love for every comment that I have received, and will receive. I am still coming down off of the edibles and this thread has taken me on a completely different trip of its own. A lot of you have stories, a lot of you have said some really encouraging things, some of you have skeptical takes, and all of these things are welcome, to discuss this moment of my life has been extremely rewarding.",

            "Your description of the time distortions reminds me of how my dad found out that I got high. \n\nI came home super high, and my dad was watching a movie on TV. I forget what the movie was but it seemed like a good idea so I made myself a sandwich and sat down to watch with him. \n\nWell I was eating that sandwich FOR EVER. I would take a bite and then chew and chew and chew and chew.... repeat. I felt like I\u2019d been eating the sandwich for my entire life. Finally I turned to my dad and said (and I quote):\n\n\u201cDude. This is, like, the everlasting sandwich.\u201d \n\nHe just looked at me, snickered, shook his head, and turned back to watch the movie.",

            "first time I did edibles I was going through the start of a migraine headache. I had heard that pot can help with the pain.\n\nso i'm in a cloud from the pain, asking about edibles and the guy behind the counter was SUPER helpful. Like he wanted to make sure I didn't have a bad experience for my first time. Did I listen? no. I was too focused on getting home and getting the pain to stop to pay super close attention. \n\nThe gummy he gave me was a \"lego brick\" style gummy. all told 80mg but it has 8 posts like the 2x8 bricks of lego. made that way so you can just cut out a 10mg dose which is good for a beginner... but if you have a really low tolerance like I assumed I would have... cut it in half again for 5mg. You can always add more. My problem was I missed a cut it in half part, and figured \"i'm a big guy, a standard dose will be fine\" so I took a double dose. 20mg. Not a huge amount, but certainly more than I was ready for.\n\nI was laying in bed after I took my dose and just relaxing... my wife put on some dinner just a frozen lasagna thing. after probably 45 mins I got up thinking nothing was happening... and made my way downstairs. I checked on dinner which was finished but I was sure it wasn't done. so I went and sat down elsewhere, and just waited for a really long time... (5mins)  I checked on dinner and it was finished. So I dish out some food and go back to the couch and begin to eat my dinner.\n\nNow, the weirdest part about that high was I felt like I was still up in the bedroom, while knowing I was sitting down on the couch. Somehow my mind made me think the lasagna was my blankets... and to this day, they were the tastiest blankets I've ever eaten.\n\nSimilar to you I had no real ability to tell time. I was all over the place thinking that hours were going by, but it was only a few minutes at a time. My wife started almost live streaming the event to friends... she was messaging friends what was going on, and eventually some good friends called me and we talked about the same topic several times cause I had no real short term memory. it was weird. it was like things were happening, but I didn't remember they were happening as it was happening. \n\nall in all it was a fairly funny experience in hind sight. I never got paranoid or anything, but I could understand how someone could feel that way under the influence.",
            "When I was in university I was going to go out to a club with my housemates. I thought that if I was going to be drinking I should probably have something to eat before leaving. I was feeling too lazy to cook so one of my housemates offered me a plate of pot brownies.\n\nIt is fair to say that my tolerance is quite low and I ate too many. I made it to the club, but by the time I had finished my first drink I was so disoriented and paranoid that I wanted nothing more than to go home and crawl into bed.\n\nI left and jogged the couple of miles home, the whole time paranoid that I was being followed by a giant carnivorous Mars bar.\n\nOn other occasions I have knocked myself out cold and forgotten how to use my legs. Weed and I don\u2019t always get along, but once in a while it can be fun.",
            "That\u2019s a crazy experience. Some people have those \u201cgreen outs\u201d when they take too much. Also 120mg of edibles for someone with no tolerance is fucking CRAZY. I take 180-250mg and I have an extremely high tolerance. \n\nIf you still proceed on your wedding night it\u2019s best to just take a puff or two and put the pipe down. I know this was a mistake though. Have your fianc\u00e9 label the edibles better. Have a specific marker and have her write on it so you can\u2019t possibly mix it up again. Also if it\u2019s a legal state, your wedding night you should get a strong anxiety relieving indica. Make sure to ask for that at the dispensary. Again that\u2019s if you still do it, I don\u2019t blame you if you don\u2019t though",

            "I remember my first and only time taking an edible. When it finally hit, I had to crawl my way back to my boyfriends dorm room. I was on all fours on the grass, and it felt like it took centuries to get back. Everything was in slow motion. I remember him putting spongebob on to calm me down but I would laugh, then look at the clock and cry when I realized 1 minute had gone by, ask how much longer the feeling would last, cry some more and repeat this exhilarating viscous cycle. At one point he even went down on me to distract me and it took every effort of my slowmo brain to focus on the feeling. Then back to the cycles of crying and time checking. What an experience.... \nLove weed for others, but mary j and I do not get along",

            "Oh god I can\u2019t imagine, my husband once fucked up and got this gummy which had a 10mg note on it. He split it for what he thought was 5 mg each and since it was pretty small I thought that was reasonable. About 20-30 minutes later I moved and felt my head spin dangerously and was like \u2018what the fuck?? Honey, how much did you give me\u2019 he moves and realizes he\u2019s also fucked up and so he grabs the packaging. \n\n10 mg per SERVING. 5 servings per gummy. Fuck. \n\nSo we had both taken about 25 mg and I was immediately like nope nope nope, time to pass out, I can\u2019t be conscious for what\u2019s next.\nYou know that toy that used to spin you really fast on until you felt like the floor was going vertical and shit? That was my experience for the next few hours because by that point I was already too high to fall asleep.\n\nI hate being overly high, it\u2019s the worst\nSo I really can\u2019t imagine 120 mg that sounds like hell on earth",

Should be about 1.5mg per pancake.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyaaaaa... wanna run me through that math again?\u201d\n\nBIL starts listing off the ingredients and ratios and stops mid-sentence...\n\nMe: \u201cYou dun fucked up, bud. You see your mistake?\u201d\n\nBIL: \u201cErrrr... ya. That\u2019s 150mg per pancake.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cYes, that\u2019s 150mg per pancake... I\u2019m gonna go get into bed while I can still walk.\u201d\n\nSo ya, ended up having 450mg! That\u2019s 90x my regular comfortable amount. Needless to say it was an interesting 24 hours. Definitely not an experience I want to repeat.\n\nPlease don\u2019t let that experience color your view of cannabis! That\u2019s be like saying you don\u2019t like alcohol after chugging 2 mickeys of fireball on your first experience drinking.\n\nCannabis is such a wonderful plant that can do so much good for you. Ease into it slowly and it will treat you well.",
            "I had a similar experience trying weed lemonade. It was also my very first time using weed and thought it would be like drinking alcohol and found it weird that my friend insisted I only take a very small sip (I took 3 big gulps). You described similar phases of how it was for me. I could feel the paranoia creeping in. Peppercorns also didn\u2019t work for me either. I tried googling and very soon I couldn\u2019t read or text or even focus. I also tried to just sleep, and it felt like I was falling into a black hole never to come out. My friend was able to console me eventually and talked me through it. 6 hours of high.... I will never use anything with THC again lol. I\u2019m so sorry you experienced this too.",
            "My first time doing edibles a friend made me a cookie, I ate half and felt nothing after an hour so I ate the other half and felt maybe something but it was ultimately disappointing. \n\nThe second time my friend gave us the same amount of weed she had used and my wife made me a brownie making sure to decarb as she had read online. After the previous time I ate the whole thing hoping to at least feel something. \n\nPretty quickly it was clear that I had made a grave mistake. I am not sure if it was the decarb or some other quirk in the process but I was went from sober to way too high very quickly. I don't remember too much just that I felt paralyzed on the couch drifting in and out of consciousness. The weirdest part was I had this moment of clarity where it felt like some long dormant part of my brain was shouting life advice at me. \n\nMy wife eventually put me to bed and I slept it off.\n\nFrom experience you probably aren't going to want to try anything like that for awhile, but if you do start slow; I generally do 5 to 10 mg at a time and that is plenty for a nice evening. Once you know your limit, prepackaged edibles are great as you can give yourself the exact dose you want.",
            "I got very lucky the first time I tried edibles, though I smoked a little bit before I tried an edible. We only had canabutter on popcorn, didn't feel shit till I got back home but I dosed myself enough that I sure felt it but not enough to have a bad experience. I had to work the next day at 3 pm, I woke up at 2:55 and told myself I still had 5 minutes so I went back to sleep. Luckily I woke up 15 minutes later and I worked in the dorm across the street so I was only 20 minutes late. But I was still high when I got there and didn't feel sober until around 7 pm that night. About 22 hours after I first started eating the popcorn.",

My first time smoking I got home, laid down in my button uo shirt and jeans and slept for 13 hours. \nThe second time I woke up in the morning and I was still high till like 9am.\nThe third I had some purple weed my friend left at my house. I smoked some, and over the course of the next week I had panic attacks. I missed 2 days of work and went to the ER. One of the days I had school and I remember sitting there and thinking \"my face feels REALLY HOT right now.\" And I got up and walked around outside for like 20 minutes.",

            "Hey dude, idk if you\u2019ll see this, but my tolerance is also super low and I\u2019m not normally as high as you got - but I might be able to prep you for your comedown! \n\nYou\u2019ll probably be high in some way/shape/form from the moment it kicks in and then for the next day or so (which it sounds like you\u2019re living atm, condolences) and then the next night after that will be your proper comedown. The next morning (your second day since) you\u2019ll probably wake up super tired but not in an exhausted sort of way, just sorta slow, sorta lazy. That\u2019s your day, and you\u2019ll be sober but out of it, always ready to sit down and doze. \n\nThen, that night, (your second since and your first sober) there\u2019s a high chance you\u2019ll have some crazy dreams. They always get me then, and if nothing happens, it might happen the next night. Usually on day three after a big high, you\u2019ll feel relatively normal, but that third night might also have crazy dreams, especially if you didn\u2019t get any on night two. If nothing happens like that by morning four, it\u2019s unlikely to occur, and you\u2019ll be more or less back to normal across the board. \n\nYou can also store thc in your fat, so if you work out a lot or lose weight significantly in the next few months, and you feel reminiscent to when you were high for a moment or two and you haven\u2019t taken any weed, that\u2019s totally normal. You\u2019re not going crazy, you haven\u2019t broken your brain chemistry, it\u2019s just remnants of your gigantic first time. That being said, I wish you good luck, and speedy recovery!",

It's happened twice for me this year where I got way too high, and I'm a regular toker.\n\nFirst time was in January, when weed was first legalized in Illinois, a friend of mine and his boyfriend came down from Wisconsin to purchase some with me (They are from here, but just live in Wisconsin), and we hung out at my place. My friend got a vape pen, and we both took hits of it, within 5 minutes we were completely gone. We looked at the package and it said \"High Potency: Warning\" and we were in for a 3 hour rollercoaster of insane highness. Luckily his boyfriend doesn't smoke, so he babysat us the entire time.\n\nSecond time was in July, friends and I went to a cabin in St. Louis (We all got tested for the rona to be responsible). I brought a bunch of weed and edibles with me to have fun in the foothills. I smoked a joint, an older one so I thought the potency wore off, didn't feel anything. Smoked a bowl, 60 minutes pass, didn't feel \\*anything\\*. I must have already been high because I thought it was a good idea to pop a 10mg edible on top of that. 30 minutes go by and my entire world shrinks down to the size of a pea and I am fucked up. I didn't come down for a solid 5 hours, and there were multiples times where I was screaming \"Help\" in my head but no words came out. There was a red light in the room we were staying in, so I thought I was legit in Hell. \n\nWord to the wise, always smoke slowly and in moderation. Never go overboard with anything. It just leads to not fun nights.",

So, I munch a brownie.  An entire brownie.  Then Mel and Marcy are looking at me like... fuck.  \n\nI\u2019d never done an edible before. \n\nI remember smiling and staring at the water, and a bird flew, but really it trailed in slow motion across the sky, and as I turned my head to follow it felt wobbly and weak.\n\nShit.\n\nI swear I would shut my eyes and it would be like a cartoon in my head.  \n\nI called my ex, in a panic. To come pick me up.  It was a gated beach in his neighborhood.  So although it felt like 5 hours, he said it was merely 20 minutes only because he walked to the convenient store when I called. \n\nWhen he pulled up I RAN to his car.  I mean, as of I was chased by a murderer and promptly threw up into my own bikini clad lap.\n\nSince the vomit was brown, because, I ate a brownie I said on a cry: \u201caaah, I shit myself!\u201d\n\n\u201cGREAT!\u201d My ex said, in a not very enthusiastic way. \n\nI was able to go to his house and sleep it off.

I asked for the lowest dose I could possibly get via edible since I don\u2019t want anything other than air in my lungs. 20 mg my stoner friend said. Little did I know that was a lot for the first time. Also little did I know he was *lying* and the real dose was FIFTY mg. So like for 40 minutes I feel nothing.

I remember crying like a baby with my head over the toilet thinking I was going to throw up, and I remember trying to sleep it off but the world was moving like a game of TF2 on 800 ping. \n\nI couldn\u2019t listen to The Wall (my favorite album) for *months* after that.

The jar said something like 10gm/gummy (I can\u2019t remember exact grams it said). 10 servings. Well. It was my first time taking medical cannabis but not my first time taking an edible. My bf convinces me that I should take more than 1. I eventually cave, & ended up taking 2. \n\nWe had just moved in together & had to pack the rest of my belongings from my dads home.

At one point while packing (my dad is at work so he isn\u2019t at home) we decide to fuck on my bedroom floor. I have a slight recollection of it but not much. The only thing i can remember is stripping down naked walking through the house absolutely freaking out about how its hot & i cannot breathe, I tried to take a shower (my vision feels like those movies when you\u2019re watching someone trip & everything is blurry but somehow they manage to get where they\u2019re going?) & end up in my room on the floor.

I can remember him saying \u201care you sure\u201d & i eventually was able to get dressed enough to lay in his car while he did all of the packing. \n\nI just have to say- my man is so good to me.

Then higher. Then higher. And I started to fucking panic. I went through a range of emotions to happy, giggles, sad, panic, major paranoia and massive fear. My dad was driving the speed limit and every time he lightly tapped the brakes to slow down or whatever I would freak out like thinking we were going to wreck and I was like \u201cdad stop speeding!!!!\u201dHe gave me a look like the fuck I\u2019m going 65. I felt like I was in a spaceship fucking soaring.

I screamed and opened my eyes. I felt like I couldn\u2019t move I was so heavy. We got to the house at like 6 and I slumped on the lazy boy and slept till 11 and woke up with extreme munchies lmao."

        "selftext": "Obligatory this didn't happen today but a few weeks ago. Also I'm on mobile blah blah. \n\nI'm not very good at using Snapchat for it's intended purpose but I like to post dumb videos of my two dogs being cute or goofy. I especially like to use the filter that makes glitter or stars sparkle across the screen. \n\nSo a few weeks ago the hubby and I are just chilling in the bed, petting our Pomeranian. He had just gotten out of the shower and it's a hot day so he's just chilling, legs spread, with his Jurassic Pork out.\n\nPancake (our pom) starts rooting into the blanket and being adorable, so I whip out my phone and start to record on Snapchat. I get a few seconds and do a quick zoom into her face because it's hilarious. Then I post it to my story, send a copy to my husband and close the app. \n\nAbout an hour later he picks up his phone and starts to scroll. I'm not really paying attention to him and it's really quiet. All of a sudden he just screams \"YOU POSTED MY DICK ON SNAPCHAT\". I just giggle and say \"haha real funny\". Then I thought about it for a second and realized what happened. I started laughing so hard I was crying and I couldn't breathe. \n\nI open my phone to look and sure enough in the corner of the video you can see my husband's meat thermometer just hanging out in the corner, glitter filter and all. This brought on another bout of crying laughter and he decided to take my phone away. \n\nWe deleted the video, then he records himself explaining what happened and that he hopes everyone that viewed my story enjoyed the show. He then shames me and points the camera to me and I'm hiding my face and still laughing. \n\nI feel like I should mention that we both found this hilarious and no one is angry. It's definitely an interesting story to tell everyone who missed out. \n\nTL;DR: Posted a video to my Snapchat story of my dog being a goof while my husband laid in bed naked and got his womb broom on camera.\n\nEdited to add dog tax\n\n\n[Dog Tax](https://imgur.com/a/zHzpfCs)",

            "Used to live with three women, including my GF, and one of my best friends at the time.  One night gf is working late so I decided to just pack it in and go to bed early.  My friend busts down my door and demands I get up and go grab a few beers with her. I eventually cave and say fuck it. So she's checking her makeup on the floor in front of my large closet door/mirror. I don't think anything of it and swing my legs out of the bed and  pull on my pants.  We head out and grab a beer and all is well for a while. Then my phone rings and it's my GF. I answer and she's telling \"tell her to delete that picture now!\" I'm confused but she just insists to hand the phone over to the roommate, so I do.  Turns out that while I was pulling on my pants roomie snapped a picture of her face in the mirror all made-up without realizing my junk was in the background. All in all no harm came of it. Gf was laughing as soon as it was deleted and now we all hate each other so it doesn't matter anyway.",

            "I saw a video of a girl who sent a picture of her engagement ring to many friends and family before realizing it was a \"live photo\" and included a short video if you clicked the picture. Her new fiance decided slapping his dick onto the ring right after the picture was funny, and neither of them realized the video was attached to the picture until after they sent it. Can't imagine standing at the alter with all those people having been sent that video as thier engagement announcement.\n\nEdit: this reddit user has found a post of this mishap, I had seen the original from someone who recieved it directly but this is a slightly edited version with less penis slapping lol thanks to user peacethruwar. https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/i9abkn/tifu_by_posting_my_husbands_dick_on_snapchat/g1fnfbe?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share",

I agreed to drop in when I'm done working.\n\nFast forward to me appearing in front of my mom's computer, initiating the update process, and proceeding to do nothing but stare at the progress bar. While I was doing that, my mom proceeded to prepare dinner. \n\nThe update was taking forever so I decided to kill time by bringing necessary order to my mom's desktop. It was a mess. Dozens of random folders scattered across the screen in no particular order whatsoever. I couldn't even see the fucking wallpaper. It was enough to summon the OCDemon buried inside of me and clean up the clutter. \n\nSo, as I was organizing my mom's shit, I noticed a folder called \"Mom's Recipes\". Now, as a guy who's dating a girl who loves a man who can cook, this folder peaked my interest. I figured it wouldn't hurt skimming over some of my mom's recipes and perhaps surprising the girlfriend with an unexpected home cooked meal.\n\nI opened the recipe folder and clicked on the word document inside. Now, I'll be honest, I'm not the world's most intelligent person, but when I see the words \"mom\" and \"recipes\", I imagine wholesome family dinners and shit. NOT...\n\n\"I'm a woman, I'm a widow, I'm a mother, I'm over 50, and I'm still the whore next door\"\n\nThis was the fucking opening line to my mom's so called \"recipes\". It was an ominous sign that I should not read any fucking further. I read further. It became clear to me my mom's recipes had nothing to do with how to cook, but rather how to fuck. I made it through the first two pages before the \"recipe book\" went into graphic detail about what my mom's preferences were when it comes to size of the dick going into her mouth and vagina versus the size of the dick going into her ass. \n\nI closed the document, finished the update, and got the fuck away from that computer. My mom invited me stay for dinner but I declined. All I could see was different sized dicks entering my mother everywhere. I think I need to end our relationship now. \n\nTL;DR Read my mom's recipes and realized her favorite ingredient is cock.",

I, being absolutely zooted, turned to my roommate and asked him what he thinks about to keep himself from nutting when he and his girlfriend do the deed. And to which he gave a quite reasonable answer of, \u201cI just stare at a wall and let my mind go blank.\u201d \n\nWhere this takes a horrible turn is when he asked me the same thing. At which point I turned to him and confessed that I think about Tarzan. Specifically the part of the movie when Tarzan is sliding down the vines and the song \u201cSon of Man\u201d is playing in the background. I can\u2019t say for certain why this image always pops up in my head, but it has never failed me so far.\n\nCue the eruption of laughter as all of my roommates are baffled by my method. Everyone immediately started looking up the video on YouTube and showing me the clip of Tarzan sliding down the vines, which made me very flaccid indeed.\n\nIn the weeks after, every time I bring my girlfriend to our house and go upstairs, my phone is bombarded with messages from my roommates sending me gifs of Tarzan sliding down the vines. I\u2019m worried that this will not end anytime soon, as I haven\u2019t been able to get it up ever since.\n\nTLDR : I told my roommates that I think about Tarzan to keep myself from nutting too early.",

            "Hey! I have a similar fuck up. Summer of '09 I finished the summer as a tour guide up in Alaska. We had this hokey tour where we would take tourists in the backcountry for a few hours and feed them some Dinte Moore, burnt coffee, and fry bread.\n\n\nWe carried bear spray with us because we kept food back there. One of us would go early in the morning and set up the camp.\n\nWell, it was my turn. I'm just out there with my thoughts waiting for the last tour. Now, the whole time we're out there we have to shoo away the squirrels who are relentless for that flour (that we use to make the fry bread). A week earlier my colleague told me he was a little successful with keeping the squirrels away by using the bear spray. I never shot the stuff, so I thought 'why not?'\n\n\nSo empty out the bear spray on the thieving squirrel and it's just wiping it's eyes for a little minute and coming back. So I'm hazing this motherfucker every time he comes back.\n\n\nCue the tourists who light into the Dinte Moore and tell me that's it's spicy. I nearly shit myself thinking I fucked up. 'Was it too much?' I ask? 'Nah, we're from Louisiana, this is good!'\n\nPhew!\n\n\nThe tour ended and break down camp for the day. Before hitting the trail for a damn 1.5 drive back to town, I take a piss in the woods. THAT was my fuck up. As a dude, I didn't think twice about washing my hands, I was done preparing food for the day and was trying to get lost. Nope, nope, nope. 20 minutes into that drive, the burning was unbearable. And then I came across a mother moose who was blocking the trail. There's nothing you can do when that happens...just wait until she's eaten her fill of trail salad.\n\n\nI finally got back to town and the fire in my loins was beginning to subside but damn...I was near tears for most of that ordeal.",

        "selftext": "So we had just finished having a wholesome breakfast of eggs, potatoes and cinnabread my wife made and I hopped into the shower. When I shower I listen to a bluetooth speaker, mostly youtube. Midway through my shower my wife unlocked the door and busted in claiming she had to pee. I'm a private person and always shower with the door locked, but obviously she isn't. After she finished she asked to come into the shower, but I was in the midst of shaving my legs (yes I'm a guy, I just don't like body hair) and told her no because I had a razor in my hand and our shower is a tiny two shoulder's width stall. She said fine and walked away. Shortly after her departure my audio goes out, and I hear the sound of a cat meowing angirly into a microphone blare out of my speaker. This is followed by a series of animal noises and a slew of additional videos including such gems as \"Top 3 Minecraft songs\" and \"3 hours of farting.\" Sure enough, she'd stolen my phone. I got out of the shower when she started blasting victory royal fanfare and when she saw me she started dabbing furiously and ran away. This behavior continued for at least ten more minutes before I was finally able to get my phone back.\n\nEDIT: First time using reddit, color me impressed. I did not expect this to get nearly the attention that it did and thanks very much to the lovely people who gave me the silvers and the gold! This is not an isolated incident, if my wife finds that I've left my phone unattended while she suspects my headphones are in she will steal it and my music will be instantly cut off and replaced. Her go-to video is '3 Hours of Farting' and her stated goal is to one day have me make it through the entire video in this manner. I am extremely aware that she is an absolute gem of a woman and I'm very grateful to have her in my life, thanks to those of you who've pointed that out. For those of you \nasking, shower sex was not an option. Our shower is smaller than the tiny shower stalls you'd find in the changing rooms at your local beach. We've done shower sex before, it's a miserable experience, shampoo bottles falling all over your ankles, would choose a bed every time.\n\nTL;DR, I married a middle schooler in a 23 year old woman's body and got dabbed on.",

Good lord. \n\nFinally,... how is this a TIFU?  You literally did nothing other than shower. If your wife was writing it and you were leaving here this would be a TIFU.

Apparently the mood soured soon after that, and he left her place awkwardly.\n\nNow I pack a standard issue 6 incher with some room for expansion depending on my level of arousal, never had any complaints from previous partners which by then was a significant number, there never was any reason for me to second guess my sexual abilities. I did have an acute awareness of being a grower and not a shower, buying into the porn skewered reality that bigger is better, whatever latent insecurities I had was magnified and put on display . My breaking point came as these words uttered from her lips  \u201cI kid you not he was probably twice as big as yours\u201d, it carved deep into my consciousness with animated violence, overwhelming me with feelings of inadequacies, clouding my ability to control my most basic faculties. She then said something about how much she anticipated my visit and how she thinks she is falling for me blah, blah, blah. She ended her confession by teasingly going down on me kissing my flaccid cock telling it \u201cthis is all I will ever need\u201d. \n\nI don\u2019t think I have ever felt so small in my life. I got out of bed, got dressed In abject silence and just left the room without saying a word. This of course left her in a state of confusion. I never called her again and blocked her on all my social media counts. I spent the next few days at home in crippling depression wallowing in self pity, rejection and inadequacies. \n\n\nThinking back, now a far more secured man in my 30s, I often second guess my reaction. Was I being an insecure drama queen?. There i was, just had the most amazing sex in my life, this gorgeous girl I really liked was pouring her heart out, praising the superiority of my average sized member whilst professing her love for me. Yet the only image in my head is her staring with wide eyes at the sheer size of his monster dong. Once the image got stuck in my bead , my ego blinded by the green eyed monster, there was no turning back.\n\nEdit and afterthought:  To address some common questions: \n\nThe fateful night took place some 15 years ago. We were both getting ready to start our new lives in different countries. So any form of commitment then would take the form of a long distance relationship. \n\nI am sure her intent was not malicious, she probably thought she was being sultry and sexy and hey, what is youth without a few awkward and misguided episodes? \n\nI certainly could have handled the situation with more finesse, but thats the nature of fear, insidious in its grapple, my emotional and mental faculties went into complete paralysis, I saw retreat as the only option. It was cowardly and I am not proud of it. \n\nWe are connected through the grapevines of social media, but none of us reached out to each other, I guess both of us being seemingly happy in our marriage played a big role. \n\nMany people have questioned my motives in writing this with accusations of sensationalism and fabrication. The simple answer to that is, I am currently going through a divorce and the business I spent years building closed down a month ago. Symptoms of the pandemic blues often manifest as nostalgia, writing and sharing my stories here on reddit have been rather therapeutic. \n\nI would like to thank everyone for sharing your thoughts and lending me your perspective,to those who shared their own personal stories, I would try my best to reply on a more personal level but given the sheer volume, may prove difficult. To those generous souls I thank you for the rewards, its been heartwarming. \n\nTL:DR May have missed out on the best relationship in my life due to my insecurities.",

            "I had a similar experience. Had been dating a woman for a couple years, everything was awesome.\n\nDuring a trip away I was using her phone because mine had no service. A text came in from her friend.\n\n\"Hows your boyfriends little penis?\"\n\nTaken back, I confronted her and asked what it was all about.\n\nFor the record, I am a regular run-of-the-mill 6 incher.\n\nShe confessed that her previous BF was 8\" and told all her friends how much \"smaller\" I was in comparison. \n\nWe split up shortly after. She wanted to get back together and said I was \"the one,\" but I couldn't do it.\n\nMet my awesome wife shortly after and we're now expecting our second wonderful baby. No regrets.\n\nEdit: Her friend was a dude.\n\nEdit 2: to be clear, my ex never made fun of me to her friend/s, but she certainly didn't seem to care when her friend/s did.",

            "Honestly, as a woman I could *never imagine* wording my feelings the way she did. Let\u2019s say the roles were reversed and you hooked up with a girl half her size, thin, lean, a body like a runway model (this is the best way I can equate what happened to you vs what would yield the same feelings from a woman in that moment.) Imagine you telling her as soon as the other girl took her clothes off you thought she was too thin and wasn\u2019t attracted to her because she was really fit and lean and that wasn\u2019t your type. And then you go and kiss your friends stomach with a tiny pooch on it that she\u2019s self conscious of and and say \u201cthis is all I ever need.\u201d **I. WOULD. DIE.** like put me in a coffin, bury me in the ground and put a flower on my grave... \ud83d\ude2d\n\nThere were a million other ways for her to word how she was feeling and she chose the most cutting way to express herself. Thats the kind of shit lifetime insecurities are made of \ud83d\ude02 That\u2019s on her, that\u2019s definitely not on you.\n\n**Edit to add:** Society preaches bigger = better when it comes to dick size. This is obviously not the case and not everyone's preference, but the misconception comes from *somewhere.* I do not agree with it, but the idea exists. Society also preaches thinner and leaner and taller and slimmer = better when it comes to women's body shapes/sizes. This also is not obviously the case, and not everyone's preference. I also do not agree with it. But I wouldn't want to hear myself compared to this conventionally thin/attractive body and be kissed in all the wrong places as someone is comparing my thicker, rounder, softer body to someone who meet's society's standards as \"good.\"\n\nI am a woman, and I used this analogy because this would make me feel inadequate and self-conscious (how OP felt when she compared his dick size to scary monster dick dude.) No, it is not a perfect analogy, but it is close enough coming from a women's perspective. If you are arguing that a dick can be too big, but a woman \"can't be too thin and hot\" then you are proving my point for me.",
            "Think of it this way,  what if you had told her that you loved her even though she wasn't as beautiful as another woman you had a date with last weekend?  \"I was so intimidated by anothers beauty/big dick/impressive attribute that I left them and would rather have someone average like you.\" \n Fuck that.",

I really feel bad for you how your whole relationship ended just like this. It also intensified my own insecurities a bit while reading this. On the other hand this helps me.

For me whatever feelings I had for them instantly disapated. I'm 31 now and still don't wanna hear bull shit like that. \n\nIv never commented on a girls tightness, tits or ass size( especially while she's naked) so I don't need to hear that shit. \n\nIt's not about insecurities but more so a lack of respect. There you are bare, vulnerable and as intimate as can be getting judged.",
            "It's interesting that you should post this because I am wrestling with some similar insecurity in my current relationship.\n\nMy girlfriend is tall and rather slim. I am only a couple inches taller, and I am a solid 6ft. \n\nThe height isn't the issue, just a contextual thing. We have what I would consider to be great sex. She seems to enjoy it, I obviously enjoy it, but I have self consciousness issues with my dick size.\n\nI am also an average 6-incher, with the normal issue of weight \"hiding\" some.\n\nI am a fair bit overweight, probably in the 60-70 lbs range. I take responsibility for this, and struggle with my mental health to really make progress on it. But that is my own fight.\n\nThe real issue is that she has been with guys that are \"pretty big\" but says she likes that I am \"average size\" because it's more enjoyable - should be a good feeling right?\n\nNope, society strikes again. Big dicks are better dicks, if your dick is smaller than the biggest guy she's been with then you're always gonna be second rate. How could anyone want a dick that's just average?\n\nThis conditioning combined with the fact that she is a fair bit younger than me (I am 35, she is 27) gets me thinking more often than I like to admit that she could leave me at any time for someone younger, with a bigger dick.\n\nAll of this compounded by the fact that she's also bi and leans female-attracted. So I'm just living in constant self esteem and mental health related anxiety about my dick and if it's nothing special why stick around?\n\nDoesn't help that my self esteem regarding my personality suffers as well due to a lot of other issues with my past, but there you go.\n\nSo, I guess this is the long way of saying, you're not alone.\n\nGenerally speaking I am not one of those guys that likes hearing about a partners sexual past primarily for this reason. I would venture to say that as advice to anyone interested in a particular dick, just avoid talking about history, physical comparisons, all of that with the individual attached to said dick.",

            "Honestly. I get it. I\u2019m in my 50s and have still encountered this. And have had a horrible time as a result. I broke up with my girlfriend earlier in the year because of the toll her \u201coversharing\u201d took on me. She\u2019d tell me how her and her ex had a pet name for his dick. And then would go on to relate to me depictions of how \u201cSenor grande\u201d used to just plow her with little thought for her pleasure. I mean, I get that she was trying to make me feel better in that I was an attentive lover and he wasn\u2019t, but there are better ways of doing it. It\u2019s hard to lose that imagery. You can put it down to a lack of self-esteem or being emotionally disconnected (both true in her case) but it took a great deal of therapy and a lot of female friends to reinforce that this wasn\u2019t acceptable behaviour and that I wasn\u2019t just overreacting.\nAnyway, it wasn\u2019t an isolated case and to be fair, the relationship ended because she was disconnected emotionally. \nAt least it established where my boundaries lay.",

Everybody fits somebody and that dude was not her fit. \n\nShe may have expressed herself poorly, but it sounds like she was trying to say that she believed you fit together on both a physical and a spiritual level.\n\nYou had a chance at a relationship with someone you were obviously into and you pulled the trick of every Hollywood rom-com screenwriter by taking offence, walking out and at no point asking any questions or having an open and honest conversation.\n\nShe definitely expressed herself poorly, but I think due to insecurities and the folly of youth, you may have read the situation as being an insult to your masculinity as opposed to a girl essentially telling you that she loves you.",
            "I was about to comment that this was 100% her fuckup instead of yours but.. idk man, ghosting her over that wasn't ideal. \n\nWhat she said would have made many men uncomfortable, for sure, and getting up and leaving in that moment is a fair reaction. Blocking her, in my opinion, is a step too far.\n\nSo, I guess the downlow is you didn't miss out on the best relationship of your life because you were very clearly ill-matched.",

            "Nope, she wasn't naive. She either did it on purpose to make you feel bad, which worked, or she was straight braindead.\n\nI say it as a woman. We aren't idiots. We know how men treat their dicks. Yes, there's a \"perfect\" size, which is not too small and not too big, but you just simply don't say to a guy you barely date \"wow I'm glad your dick is two times smaller than my ex's\". You just don't. It's like saying to your girl \"I'm glad you're quite ugly, so i don't have to worry you'll run away\".\n\nI'd guess she'd be manipulative as fuck and you dodged a bullet.",
            "Nope. I'm a straight woman and I definitely do not blame you at all. If a man compared me to a past hookup like that I would expect him to get the hell out of my bed. Lol.\n\nI don't even blame you for the ghosting. I likely would do the same in your situation.",

She was showing you who she really is. \n\nHonesty it\u2019s true that size doesn\u2019t matter, learn how to please a woman. Very few men in my experience take the time to learn ( I don\u2019t mean porn, there are many books).\n\nI don\u2019t think that she could possibly be right for you!

            "Last night, I experienced almost this exact same thing from the woman's side! My fiance has an insecurity about his size, but I think it's absolutely perfect. He asked about the size of a man I had previously been in a relationship with and I had to be honest that he was bigger. But, just like her, his dick was TOO big. I didn't like it. But, my fiance only heard \"Other man bigger than you, you worthless and not sexually superior\" regardless of how much I was trying to tell him how wonderful and perfect he is for me.

            "Unfortunately, insecurity, like any form of mental health illnesses can\u2019t just be _turned off_ by simply thinking for the better. It sticks with your life through thick and thin. Even lots of assurance that _it\u2019s no biggie_ wouldn\u2019t help. \n\nCould she be the best partner you ever had, had she never mentioned about her previous sex life? Maybe, but she mentioned it and all hell broke loose, even that couldn\u2019t be changed. \n\nMy advice? The next time you see another person you\u2019re really good with and quickly hit it off, tell her about your insecurities and your preference on not hearing about past sex experiences or anything that brings any sense of insecurity back to you. In fact, better to ask her the same thing and know her insecurities so you could maintain trust and communication with your partner.",
            "Real or not, the fact that someone would think this is a plausible reaction really just shows how toxic our societal standards regarding penis size are. Like all the people trying to flip the situation to where he compares her to a hotter previous lay are missing the point: that a doubly big penis is not \"better\" the same way being \"hotter\" is. The guy takes being told her previous partner was twice his size like it's some soul shattering insult. Why?? I'm slightly above 6 myself, and if a girl told me that I'm half the size of the guy she was last with and it was horrible, my reaction would be \"yeah, I can imagine why that would be horrible.\" Granted, I'm pretty girthy so maybe this dude has a needly 6 inches, but it's still clearly what his partner finds perfect, so this whole affront to his masculinity thing really bugs me.\n\nNow, if you have issue with a partner talking about someone she'd just been with a few nights ago, I personally would be uncomfortable too, but it sounds like they had a very open sexual relationship and that was something they had both accepted, so while it might not match other's personal tastes I don't see it as an issue.",
            "Honey, most women really don't care that much about size. As long as you get the job done and truly care about doing well, we're really ok. I wish that people could just stop comparing themselves whether men or women. I mean can you imagine how much happier we'd all be.",
            "Well, I think the nature of the fuck up here is that penis size is such a different thing for men and women (of which I'm the latter, or A woman, at least).  For us, it's purely just does it feel good or doesn't it?  Does it fit me? Does it make me cum?  Do I like or even love the guy attached to it?  If those last two are a yes, then you are pure perfection in our eyes.  Now, the young lady, while I GET what she was trying to do (compliment you) - she's maybe got to learn to read a room.  This is a very sensitive thing for men and they have a lot of self-worth wrapped up in this... uh... appendage.  You gotta tread lightly.  I would have let it go at, \"all the people I've hung out this week made me realize nobody's as awesome or as sexy as you, at least not to me.\"  And left out any big dong details. :)",

            "Bro, who the fuck says something like that? My God\n\n\n\nYou were probably right to get out of that cuz that's a red flag. Your reaction was a bit extreme but imagine being with someone with the grace of a bull in a china shop.",

For friends and family that live far away I had their gifts shipped right to their house.\n\nAfter spending more that I should this holiday season I haven't felt the need to buy anything until last week. I remembered I had a $50 Amazon gift card, and decided to get myself more boxer briefs and black long sleeve undershirts. I ended up with around $70 (Puma performance boxer briefs are super comfy) in my cart. A few quick clicks and one confirmation email let me know my order went through. \n\nLike I said that was last week. But as of today the package still hadn't gotten here. So I checked my order and it says that it arrived. I was pissed. I had issues with delivery in the past. But I live in a small apartment building and I didn't think anyone would take my boxes. \n\nAnd then I noticed the address it shipped to. Apparently Amazon auto filled in the last address I used:\n\n my Reddit Secret Santa. \n\nSo one of you guys out there got a random shipment of underwear. If you could return them  PM me. I'd appreciate it. Otherwise enjoy some comfy boxer briefs.\n\nTL;DR my secret santa got a surprise gift.",

Honestly, the moment it happened I considered writing this post, but felt that in light of making the mistake of sending my johnson out, I might give myself some time to make sure I want this to live online forever.\n\nMy family has already told just about everyone they know the story, so I figured I'd bring all of you into the fold.\n\nSo, here we go.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been together for about 3 years, and I'm deeply in love with this girl. She is decent beyond words, fun, funny and frankly I couldn't imagine a better relationship.\n\nHer mother had offered me her grandmother's ring for our engagement, which I considered a tremendous honour. After dealing with the anxiety of toting around a family heirloom for 2 weeks and leaving it in the possession of a jeweller for cleaning and resizing, I just wanted to get the engagement over with.\n\nI know that might not sound like the most romantic way of describing my engagement, but I was nervous.\n\nI get home, get down on one knee, and she says yes.\n\nIt was a moment I won't soon forget...then...then I got creative on really burning it into my memory.\n\nNow, in my opinion, everyone more or less does their engagement announcements the same way. Holding hands close up with a ring on, or the couples pic with the open hand across the dudes chest with the ring visible, \"it's been done to death\" I thought.\n\nI proposed to my now fianc\u00e9e that we do something funny and different, and she agrees.\n\nWe settle on taking a picture of me completely naked, laying in bed, with her hand in the foreground covering my crotch with the ring on. The picture is hilarious, and we send it to my family group chat.\n\nI mean, this is my naked body afterall. Clearly, for my families eyes only.\n\nAs it turns out, the picture was taken on 'live mode'. When you held it down, my girlfriends hand would move out of the way, leaving a perfect shot of me, as naked as the day I was born, grinning from ear to ear, doing finger guns.\n\nI received a message from my brother-in-law informing us that the picture is live, that my sister was the one to discover it, and he follows it up with a picture of her in a shocked state of bewilderment.\n\nMy mother got it too, same mistake.\n\nHer first, unsolicited dick pic, at the age of 61...from her son, no less.\n\nNeedless to say, it's a story that will be told despite my protests for the remainder of my days.\n\nTL;DR my fian\u00e9e and I took a perfectly positioned photo of her engagement ring covering my package, only to have 'live mode' ruin it all.",

Not only did it taste good, but it had this weird \"spice,\" to it that wasn't like a chili pepper type spice, but wholly unique that I never tasted in other foods. It was the perfect accent when mixed with jelly, as the spiciness and the sweetness went together perfectly. Sometimes I'd \"eat too fast,\" and have a bit of a hard time breathing, but I never thought anything of it. I also remember getting some weird looks a few times as a kid talking about spicy peanut butter, but didn't think anything of that either.\n\nOne day a few months ago, I (25m) was staying at my parents house and went to make myself some lunch. I saw some peanut butter in the pantry, but no jelly so since I was hungry I slammed about an inch of peanut butter between two slices of bread and remember thinking \"wow, this is the most peanut butter I've ever eaten at once,\" but then got to work devouring my creation.\n\nThis is where the fuckup starts. A few bites in I got that \"ate too fast,\" feeling again and had to take a break to catch my breath. I started eating again and immediately got the ate-too-fast feeling again. *Damn, it's going to take me forever to eat this sandwich* I thought, so I became determined to just power through and finish it no matter how uncomfortable it was. Big Mistake.\n\nI made it to about the half way point before I knew something was wrong. It felt simultaneously like there was a rock stuck in my windpipe and like somebody had filled my lungs with peanut butter. Weezing and struggling to breath, it fucking *hurt*. The amount of time it took to take a full breath was causing me to panic and felt like I was trying to fill up a hot air balloon with a straw. I immediately started googling \"heart attack symptoms,\" but they didn't really match up. I then googled the symptoms themselves and results of \"symptoms of allergic reactions,\" started coming up. Some of the main symptoms were difficulty breathing, chest tightness, and wheezing. Then I scrolled further down and saw a section about \"things to watch out for in children,\" and the top one was... the child says their \"mouth feels hot,\" or that they say non-spicy food is spicy.\n\nAfter a painfully long period of time I started being able to breath again and suddenly all the weird looks I got from talking about spicy peanut butter made sense! Peanut butter wasn't spicy, I'd just been poisoning myself all these years! I now use peanut butter alternatives and mix my jelly with \"sweet Asian chili jelly,\" I pick up from the store and it's just as good, but doesn't almost kill me.\n\nTLDR: I thought peanut butter was supposed to taste spicy, turns out I'm just an idiot and allergic to it.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the awards! Also glad I could help some people realize the signs of allergies. \n\nEDIT 2: A lot of people were asking why I didn't immediately call an ambulance. Remember, this was something that happened all the time and I thought was normal, so it took about 30 seconds of me waiting for it to go away, then realizing it wasn't and drinking some water (40-120 seconds now), before I even went to get my phone. By this point it had actually started to get better (slowly, but noticeably) so I knew I was in the clear. This is why I googled 'heart attack,\" as it was my understanding that some of those symptoms can be transient.",

            "Peanut butter makes my face cold. Like rubbing IcyHot all over my cheeks. I assume it's an allergic reaction, but it's all that ever happens and it's happened for the past 35 years, so I'm not so worried about it.

Had never experienced it before but I was having to consciously decide to swallow my spit and knew something was immediately wrong. Went up to the teacher and asked for a pass to the nurses office and she wrote me the note without question.\n\nIt's scary stuff. Having a nut allergy is serious. You have to be careful about what you eat. At some point you'll get good enough to be able to eye ball most foods and know, but you'll still get a surprise every once in a while. Get an epi pen asap and carry it with you in a backpack everywhere. I'd also carry benadryl everywhere. Can't tell you how many times benadryl has saved my ass.",

        "selftext": "So this all went down a few weeks ago when I was visiting my lovely boyfriend. See, sex was never that big a thing for us - we waited over a year to have sex for the first time to make sure we felt comfortable and honestly are still figuring it out and trying new things.\n\nSo on a whim, I bought a cute set of lingerie, much more playful and revealing than anything I've owned before.\n\nI was feeling it that night so I slipped into the set underneath my hoodie and pants as we settled in to watch a movie. It was honestly quite a terrible movie, but it was one that was so bad it was funny, and it was his first time seeing it so I was making sure he didn't get too \"distracted\" before it was over. That said, around half an hour to the end he found my outfit and started getting impatient. Now I admit - I teased him for a while, having fun while he knew he had to sit there and (at least pretend to) watch the movie.\n\nFinally, the movie ended and I think you can imagine what happened so I won't go into many details, but our clothes were soon on the floor and his dick is lined up and ready. And so he starts pushing in a bit, then a bit more, until we hear a pop and he \\*throws\\* me off of him. His lower stomach is covered in blood and the look of shock on his face told me he was as clueless as I am - he actually asked me if I was ok first. As soon as he realized I was not, in fact, the one bleeding out at an obscene rate, he looked me in the eyes and asked for an ambulance, before jumping up and running to the bathroom.\n\nAfter an interesting conversation with the 911 dispatcher (it's about 2 in the morning at this point), I return and find a battle scene had gone down in our bathroom. I mean - it literally looked like a murder had occurred. Ladies - you may know an erection is due to an influx of blood, but I cannot stress how much fucking blood there was.\n\nSo here we are in this tiny bathroom with blood on the bed, the floor, and him, waiting for an ambulance to come. First, two firefighters come in, make sure he's not in imminent danger, and tell me to pack him some clothes. Then the ambulance comes and I ask if I can go with him (no car) only to be told \"I think YOU'VE done enough\" along with a very pointed look.\n\nAt this point, I need a ride to the hospital so I call a mutual friend who lives nearby, but I'm not sure how much my boyfriend wants to share so the conversation goes a little like this:\n\nFriend: What the fuck you woke me up!\n\nMe: \\[boyfriend's name\\] is in an ambulance can you drive to the hospital?\n\nF: Holy shit what happened?\n\nMe: Ummmmmmm don't worry about it\n\nFinally, I get to the hospital and let me tell you, going to the hospital to visit someone who's dick you fucked up is an interesting experience. All the nurses know what happened and are giving me weird looks, and my boyfriends sitting in a room covered in blood and a towel.\n\nFinally the self-proclaimed \"dick doctor\" came over and filled us in: my boyfriend may not have been circumcised before, but he was now halfway there. His foreskin tore off, because guess what? he was too fucking hard, I was too tight, and he was predisposed to this happening.\n\nSo word of advice: next time you want to tease your SO don't do such a good job.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: I teased my boyfriend a bit too much and he was so turned on his foreskin ripped when we tried to have sex, making it look as if a murder had occurred.\n\nEDIT: this seems to be concerning to a lot of guys so I want to clarify that he wasn't in any pain. Still wouldn't recommend it though\n\nSECOND EDIT: answering some commonly asked questions: yes, we will be using lube in the future, he's doing much better now but is sad he can't have sex for a bit, and the medical explanation is that he tore his frenulum, it's technically possible in all uncircumcised men but he was apparently just more prone to it (and no he didn't have phimosis), and should have worded it better but definitely not our first time having sex\n\nalso silver??? thank you guys, seriously. I posted here cuz I can't tell too many people in my life (not a very professional story if you know what I mean) and was tired of keeping it to myself, so I'm glad yall are enjoying\n\nTHIRD EDIT: to tell my SO about this post or not to tell...\n\nFOURTH EDIT: Yah the EMT and staff weren't awesome but it felt more like poorly made jokes than actual aggression, so no need to be mad at them\n\nfollow up: who is giving me wholesome awards?? I fucked up my boyfriend's dick what's wholesome about that??",

He was also the type of guy that came super quickly, so when I felt that it got very wet in my mouth, I first thought he came. But he react like he normally did when that happened, and continued enjoying. I thought it was a bit weird, and at that point I realized that the taste was a bit... Off.

Years ago I went on a night out and had quite a lot to drink, I went to my boyfriend's house to crash and in the morning he wanted some rumpy-pumpy so we started doing the things. Unfortunately, I struggle to get wet when drunk / hungover. The next thing I know, there's blood everywhere and my boyfriend's freaking out (understandable) so he calls for an ambulance but they hang up because I guess \"I need an ambulance because my girlfriend broke my dick during sex,\" sounds too much like a prank call to possibly be legit. \n\nWe don't drive and even if we did I would've been over the limit so I knocked on a neighbour's door to ask for a ride and we spent the morning in the hospital, me feeling sick and hungover whilst still a bit drunk and wobbly, my boyfriend with a towel between his legs, both of us feeling pretty sorry for ourselves.\n\nIt wasn't all bad though, the purple parsnip made a full recovery, he ended up marrying me and we've got 2 gorgeous kids.",

She pulled it down really fast and hard while waking me up with oral, so I wasn\u2019t naturally lubed up down there and it tore my frenulum. It didn\u2019t effect my foreskin, but It bled a lot, hurt a lot, and eventually healed without any trips to the ER. \n\nThe issues started about a year or so later. Scar tissue isn\u2019t as stretchy as regular skin apparently. So I could get an erection like normal but sex was excruciating for the first few minutes until everything was lubed up and stretched a bit. I lived like that for a long time, easing into sex and trying to maintain an erection with sharp shooting pain in the tip of my dick whenever I started having sex. Until I couldn\u2019t take it any more and went to get circumcised. I figured a circumcision would remove the issue and sex wouldn\u2019t be painful anymore. The urologist suggested a penile frenulectomy instead, it was one of the best decisions in my life. They just cut my frenulum instead and put some stitches in it so it wouldn\u2019t heal back together. No more pain, and I\u2019ve had a few women really like it, I can look like I have foreskin, or I can pull it all the way back and look circumcised. Sex also feels better than before the accident, so that\u2019s a bonus also. \n\nIf this has happened to anyone else out there I\u2019d 100% recommend getting that procedure done, it\u2019s life changing.",

It created a lovely vibrato that echoed off the walls and filled the church with what could best be described as Gabriel's trumpet.\n\nThe church was quiet for a few seconds then the giggling started, I looked up to the altar and the priest was physically trying not to laugh, the second reader ascended the altar. At this point, there is muffled laughter all around...then...it happens...\n\nThe priest stands up at his chair, says \"I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I can't...\" and he runs off to the side entrance to the sacristy, I can hear him laughing.\n\nAt this point I decide it's a total loss, I shame facedly duck out of the back of the church, run to my car and have been hiding in my house ever since.\n\nTL;DR  Farted during mass, made the priest laugh and now I gotta find another church.

            "I had a similar experience.  I went to a catholic school.  And in the principal's office sat recycled pew against the wall for seating.  I was in roughly 4th grade.\n\nWhen report cards came out, we'd all be asked to the principal's office to discuss them individually.  That office was separated into a main area (where the pew was...along with a secretary) and a private office for sister Mary George (our roughly 70 year-old, stern-faced principal).\n\nThere were three of us waiting to see Sr. Mary George that day.  I was on the far left with two boys to the right of me -- let's call them Jeremy and Kirk.  It was very quiet.  You could easily hear that there was talking occurring on the other side of the door, but couldn't make out the actual words.  Mrs. M, a 30-something secretary, had her mind set to something.  Then in happened.\n\nouy of nowhere comes machine gun fire.  There's really no closer way I can describe it.  It was so loud and evenly spaced between pops.  I could tell my Jeremy's reaction that it was Kirk farting.  It lasted long enough for me to look over and make a very confident deduction.  Kirk was like 90 lbs.  the noise was so loud that, honestly, I would've expected the built-up pressure to life him fully off the pew.  It was like a startling pounding on a counter...likr when Kramer is trying to get Mickey mantle's attention at the diner.  But 20 times over a 4-5 second period.\n\nBut the sound wasn't the most unsettling part.  The vibration jumped through the wooden pew so cleanly...and up through me.  I distinctly remember feeling it in my elbows.\n\nKirk was already laughing...mid-fart laughing.  While Jeremy and I tried to figure out what act of war had just been perpetrated, he was cackling.  There was a very brief period afterwards of silence that was broken when Mrs. M said \"oh my god.\"  Jeremy and I didn't laugh out loud.  We did that thing where we held in our laughs and kind of whimpered.  Both of us.  And we were crying.

        "selftext": "For starters this literally just happened ten minutes ago, and be ready to buckle up because boy is this one long.\n\nSo, my fiance\u00e9 (F29) and I (M30) have lived in our current apartment for 8 months and have had a pretty decent experience overall. It would be perfect if it wasn't for the neighbors that moved in about four months ago. Just to set the stage for what we have been going through, these neighbors throw parties that start at 4:00 am and end at 2:00 pm all the time and when they aren't having their parties they are just blaring music loud enough to make Hellen Keller ask them to STFU all day long. Both my fianc\u00e9 and I work from home, so this can get incredibly annoying, but nevertheless we solider on. \n\nWhich brings us to today. Today I noticed from my office that there is a persistent beeping. After about five minutes I go to the living room and ask my fianc\u00e9 if that was our neighbors smoke detector. She said that she thinks so, so I went to investigate.\n\nI go out in the hall and notice that the sound is coming from their apartment, but I don't smell any smoke and the door is cold to the touch. So I figure they have it under control and go back to my apartment to continue working. About twenty minutes later I notice it is still going off (and by this point my dog is freaking the fuck out) so I go back to the hallway, smell smoke, and courageously bang on the door. No answer. I continue banging on the door but no one is responding.\n\nSo I do the only logical thing and call maintenance. I give maintenance man (henceforth MM) the run down on the days events and he says he'll be right over. Problem solved right? Wrong! Because this dear listeners is when the story gets fun.\n\nMM arrives, goes to the neighbors apartment, and does his maintenance thing. When no one answers he goes in and the horrid smoke detector finally stops. I am just about set to go back to my work when all of a sudden there is a knock on my door. \n\nI open it to find MM standing there on the phone telling another member of maintenance to get the police and ambulance on their way over because he thinks \"the kid next door is dead\". MM then looks at me and says \"I need you to come in here with me incase he is faking and attacks.\"\n\nNow, I have been in some fights in my youth but I am in no means someone who is prepared to duke it out with anyone holding any kind of weapon. Not to mention the fact that MM has a good 2 feet and 120 lbs. on me so if he goes down I'm all but fucked. So naturally I do the responsible thing and agree to go with MM.\n\nWe enter an apartment FILLED with smoke and I see a burnt pot on a stove covered in the foam from a fire extinguisher. Apparently a fire had started and MM put it out and opened all the windows to try to get rid of the smoke.\n\nAnd, sure enough, passed out on the floor, is one of my fucking neighbors (henceforth Fire Starter a kid I am assuming is around 23). MM proceeds to shake and nudge Fire Starter in an attempt to get a response. But this kid ain't moving folks. We're in there for at least five minutes trying to get this kid up, so eventually MM tells whoever he is on the phone with to \"get the ambulance and police over here now\".\n\nApparently, \"police\" was the magic word because Fire Start wakes the fuck up and goes agro on MM. MM takes it like a champ and proceeds to tell Fire Starter he is a dumbass and almost burning down a building is not okay. Fire Starter just keeps yelling for MM to get the fuck out (I had beyond backed out into the hall at this point). MM keeps his cool and just keeps saying \"man we just saved your life show some goddamn respect\".\n\nFire Starter then asks for MM's name so he can report him, which MM gave, then asked for my name so he can report me for trespassing. MM refused to give my name saying \"he's the only reason you're alive right now you useless shit\". To which Fire Starter grabs a kitchen knife and starts waiving it at MM. MM keeps his cool, collects his keys, and walks off all while Fire Starter chases him down the stairs being an incoherent little shit. In the meantime I have predictably retreated to my own apartment only to have Fire Starter standing outside my door screaming \"I know where you live you piece of shit\".\n\nGood times.\n\nTL;DR Dumb ass young violent neighbor passed out and caught his stove on fire, I called maintenance thereby saving his life, and now I am looking for a new place to live.\n\nUpdate: Just got done giving my statement to the police. Thank you to everyone who was asking for updates. It\u2019s for sure a fucked up tale that is far from over. I\u2019ll provide updates as I hear things.\n\nUpdate 2: There has been a cop outside the apartment building all morning. Haven\u2019t heard anything from inside today though. \n\nUpdate 3: Haven\u2019t updated for a while because I was waiting on confirmation but Fire Starter was evicted. We noticed someone moving out about a week later but didn\u2019t see who it was and yesterday noticed another couple moving in. Haven\u2019t met them yet but I also haven\u2019t heard a peep from their apartment even with them unloading. So they are already better than our last neighbor.\n\nAcknowledgement: Yes we should have called the fire department first. We didn\u2019t because this is not the first time their smoke detector has just gone off. Usually they let it beep the whole time they cook, but it has never gone off that long before.",

She was gorgeous and she seemed very fun and outgoing but she did have a investment girl boss vibe to her (and that's ok but I should've seen it coming). \n\nI asked her for a coffee date and she says yes, we meet up and she looks good but not exactly like her photos, no problem there let's see if we connect I thought.\n\nThe first 10mins goes great, conversation is flowing and I ask her if she wants some coffee (after all we're at a coffee shop on a coffee date), she says no, because she had some earlier (first red flag, I mean who goes on a coffee date but drinks some just before the actual date?)\n\nA tells me to go and get one for myself if I want. Alright no problem, I go and get my coffee and when I come back, there's another girl at our table. \n\nShe says, hey this is my partner (we'll call her B), I was working with her earlier. That's when it hit me that this wasn't a date lol.\n\nB starts asking me questions about my job, my studies and asks me If I would listen to their business plan so that I could make more money each month (lmao).\n\nSo she takes out a notepad and starts explaining me their business model and how much money I would make If I would find 3 other persons who would find 3 other people themselves, etc. \n\nI straight up tell her : \"So this is like a pyramid scheme right? This ain't no date?\" To which A responds : \"Oh it is a date but you seemed like a cool person to become our partner (lmao what) and this isn't a pyramid scheme, it's multi-level-marketing (MLM)\". Okay so exactly the same thing. I couldn't believe that this was happening to me.\n\nOh boy, so I sat there for legit 15 more mins and listened to them explain to me how I could make up to 5k a month if I were to get 100 people to join this business.\n\nI told them I had to leave to go to the vet with my dog. They didn't seem happy that I wasn't interested in their MLM lmao. I laughed so much on the way home that I was crying. \n\nTLDR : Went on a coffee date with a gorgeous girl from Tinder and when I went to get my coffee she texted her business partner to come and pitch me their pyramid scheme business model for 30mins.\n\nEdit 1 : Thank you so much for the awards, upvotes and comments! I did report A's profile on Tinder as spam as soon as I got home. The product they were trying to sell were some vitamins, proteins, Omega-3 tablets and some \"very good collagen\" lol.",

She was laughing and making eye contact and kept touching my arm.\n\nThen she said she had a question for me.  I was like sure.\n\nThen she said:.

Then he gave me his whole breakdown, and I was like \"thanks, but no thanks!\" Then, dumbass young me, my buddy was telling me that he had a \"sales\" gig, and that I could pretty much work my schedule around my regular work schedule.

It sucks too, because the way my luck goes, one of these day someone will probably want to offer me the gig of a lifetime, but want to meet at a gas station, and I will be like \"oh, hell no!\" and miss out!

My best friend finds the\u00a0habit\u00a0funny and has started doing it herself to some extent.\n\nWell a few weeks ago I was looking for a new\u00a0vibrator\u00a0and found one I liked and ordered it. I have a close relationship with my best friend\u00a0and\u00a0we talk about everything together so I also told her about this new\u00a0purchase. I\u00a0of course\u00a0gave the vibrator a name, Billy.\n\nWell Billy finally arrived in the mail a few days ago and I gave it test run. Billy was great, nothing to complain about. Later I was texting my friend and she asked me about my vibrator and if it was any good since she was contemplating\u00a0whether\u00a0to get one herself. She texted me with \"Did you try Billy already, was he worth it?\" To which I replayed: \"Yeah Billy was great, a bit\u00a0expensive\u00a0but I'd say he was\u00a0definitely\u00a0worth it. Good when \"my boyfriends name\" is not around haha\"\n\nNow that doesn't sound too weird if you know that Billy is a vibrator. My boyfriend of two months unfortunately didn't know that.\u00a0\n\nMy boyfriend saw the texts without me knowing and confronted me a few days later. He was angry asking me how I could cheat on him and basically broke up with me while I was standing there like an idiot trying to figure out what was going on. I asked him\u00a0what the hell\u00a0he was talking about and he started shouting at me about me fucking some prostitute called Billy.\n\nThat was when I realized what had happened and all I could do was laugh. I explained to him through my laughter that Billy was my vibrator I had named, not another man I was sleeping with. After\u00a0a lot\u00a0of explaining he finally understood the situation and calmed down. He now knows about my weird habit of naming things.\n\nTldr; I named my new vibrator Billy and texted my friend about it. My\u00a0boyfriend\u00a0saw the texts and thought I was cheating on him with a male prostitute.\n\nEdit: I appreciate your concerns about my relationship. It's always nice to see that people care. But like I have said in the comments, we both have each others permission to use each others phones to a certain extent. He saw the texts by accident and I trust him since he hasn't given me any reasons not to. This issue has been talked about between the two of us and that's all I'm going to say about it.",

She's stressed from work, I had just lost my job, and we lost a roommate so we aren't really focused on eating as well as we should. She calls me into the bathroom one night complaining about some intense stomach pain. The area she indicates is right where her appendix would be. She's crying from the pain, I'm freaking out because how are we going to afford this but my worst fear is that her appendix ruptures and she's in real trouble. She can't walk from the pain, it literally has her doubled over. So I pick her up, put her in the car and we drive to the ER. We're pulling into the parking lot and she says her anxiety is really acting up and she needs a minute to calm down before she goes inside which is normal for her. So we wait. About 2 min later she goes, I'm so sorry, and me knowing what's coming next starts to roll down the windows and she let's out the most putrid, drawn out, eye watering, nasal clearing fart I've ever heard come out of a human.

We went to a doc and I got antibiotics and opiate pain meds. \n\nTo set the stage for the next three days: I wasn't eating for a couple days before the doc because it was too painful. Opiates also make me instantly and completely constipated. Like no movement going on down there. Antibiotics also turn my guts to muds and give me the worst watery diarrhea (as I learned during this story).\n\nI took the Vics first and then the antibiotics. And then started to feel better. This was a Sunday. By Wednesday the worst of it was over and I was happily off the pain meds because they make me feel weird and halfway through my antibiotics regimen. \n\nI realized at some point I was feeling worse and had shit since Sunday. Guts were bubbling but nothing was moving. I asked my dad to pick up prune juice at the store. He brought me a quart and without a thought I drank the whole thing. About an hour later I was on the toilet holding the walls and sweating as cramps gripped my guts. Stuff was happening.\n\nIt started with the biggest turd I've ever passed. It felt like a demon was slowly clawing its way out of my asshole. After a minute of this monster wrestling itself free it finally broke loose and landed with a solid plop. This was the opiate turd. It was followed by 20 high pressure squirts of diarrhea each shot punctuated as my upper guts refilled my lower guts so it could fire again. It splatter my legs , etc. \n\nFinally, if all stopped and I took a shower. I'll never forget my dad's face when I came out of the bathroom. We've laughed about facts all my life but it was all concern, \"you okay?\"\n\nI slept for like 12 hours after that only waking up eventually poop again...\n\nTldr: careful with opiates and antibiotics",

As I got up at 10 am to join the online meeting in Zoom, my bed started calling me. I fucking felt it. I joined, and didn't mute myself. Normally I'd mute myself because I have a parrot. My parrot is an Indian Ringneck, and those bastards are loud as fuck. I decided to fall asleep through the whole class as my bed felt so good.  Only after I woke up an hour after the class I realised I was still in the meeting with an unmuted microphone. I texted one of my classmates and they told me they couldn't have a normal class, and the teacher didn't know how to kick me out. They also said they tried talking with the parrot, they told me he said \"Hello\" and \"What you doing\" and then proceeded to repeat \"ok\" for the duration of the class. \n\nTLDR: I joined my online class, forgot to mute myself, slept, and my parrot was screaming all throughout it.\n\nEDIT: Talked with my teacher to explain her what the hell was going on and she told me she hadn't muted me because she wanted to have fun with the parrot. I guess teachers can get lonely in such depressing times.\n\nEDIT 2: Since you all have been asking me for pictures, here you go.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/parrots/comments/fr50y2/my_wet_chicken_salutes_you/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/parrots/comments/foqa65/my_parrot_has_made_a_new_friend_during_this/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/parrots/comments/fn2b3u/oh_youre_home_now/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/parrots/comments/e201s1/hello_first_time_poster_on_this_sub_i_just_got/",

            "Couple of years ago I moved into a new role that was very senior, sort of my first experience as a 'data architect,' and it was for a big F500 company. I'm a few weeks on the job and there is this big company wide meeting with a lot of C-level executives. I ended up dialing in from a conference room and I was the only one in the room. It was mostly fluff stuff that didn't have any meaning to me, so I was happily sitting there working on other stuff when I got a phone call from my mentor, who taught me everything I know about the business.\n\nSo I take the call and I'm telling him about the new job, and how fucked up all their data is, and how it was way worse than where we both worked, and how fucked up things had been since I started working there because of things like licensing being delayed, access, etc. (for example, it took me a month to get access to the database because I was told they didn't think I needed access to the database... as a database architect....)\n\nAll of a sudden I realize the conference phone wasn't on mute. \n\nTo this day I never found out who heard me, but I can tell you that all of my problems disappeared over night after that day, and weeks later every single person who had originally been involved in hiring me were let go. Every single one from directors up to VPs.\n\nI was then promoted and put into a new group where I worked happily for several years.\n\nedit: Just for clarity, I was saying it bluntly since I was talking to my friend, not just being polite, I was using the F word a lot and telling him how \"fucked up\" our shit was, and how it was \"way more fucked up\" than anything I had seen before. Also for clarity, the presenter couldn't hear me, so the meeting didn't stop, I was on a line with my group (up to a C level exec) and all of them could hear me. No one ever said a word or told me to shut up.

Of course the cockatoo soon learnt to mimic ex MIL perfectly and he spent all day trudging back and forth (as the bird would wait until he was in the garden for at least 5 - 10 minutes before starting again,) to be told that she hadn't called him. Then ex MIL would stand at the steps screaming to him when there was actually someone ringing and he was ignoring her, which infuriated her. Both of them ended up barely speaking.\n\nFinally one day when they were both out, we just happened to be outside and hear the cockatoo calling for Henry and we were able to explain to them both what was happening.

The firm of solicitors I worked at were part of a big chain who produced free wills via workplace offers and trade union deals. People would fill out a form, send it in and we would construct their will based on the preferences on the form.\n\nI was sharing an office with an attractive, funny and smart young woman (23) who gave me the appropriate training to complete these wills. At the time i was 46. \n\nShe had dumped her boyfriend of several years because she found out he had been sleeping with someone else while she was at university. Their home town was several hundred miles away.  During her brief period of being single she asked me what sort of age gap between people was acceptable. We had long conversations about it. I told her i knew of couples who were 5, 10, 12, 15 and 17 years older/younger than their wife/husband/partner.\n\nShe then mentioned that she had heard that centuries ago older men often married.much younger women as they were more able to take care of said younger woman who was more likely to survive childbirth and go on to be a good mother while the more mature husband's income kept them comfortable. \n\nShe kept asking my opinion and asked if I would ever consider seeing a younger/older woman than me. Not thinking it very likely I just shrugged and avoided the question.\n\nThroughout the months we worked together we often went out after work and at the weekends in a group. She would dress very provocatively and on the occasions she wore stockings she would let me know she was (I'd previously confessed to having a particular weakness/fondness for them). After several months she got onto a Solicitors training programme and left. We kept in touch and met on occasions for food, coffee or drinks. \n\nAfter a couple of years she met someone at her new firm and we stopped meeting. They got married and had a baby.\n\nI bumped into her about an hour ago in court. I was delivering some papers and she was there representing a client. She was all over me and insisted we had coffee and a chat. It was then that she told me that the reason for asking about big age gap relationships was that she had a massive crush on me but was too scared of damaging our friendship by doing anything about it but hoped that I would. When she finally decided it wasnt going to happen she left.\n\nOf course I had absolutely no idea this was going on and that this gorgeous young woman had any interest in me beyond friendship. Honestly, I could cry.\n\nTL:DR Made friends with hot girl in the office, didn't notice she had a crush on me.",

            "I get where you're coming from, I'm in my 40s and because its so unlikely someone in their early 20s is going to fancy you, you just dismiss it as a possibility.\n\nYou don't want to get a reputation for being the pervy older guy who chases after young women so you play things as straight as you can. \n\nNothing more than friendly banter and being yourself (well work you).\n\nBut still thats a big 'oof man'"

Yesterday in particular was super stressful, I came home from an overnight stay at a new sexual partner\u2019s place, Nick. I was texting Nick, my best friend, my sister in law, my step mom, and my dad all at the same time. \n\nYou can probably already guess what happened...\n\nI was texting Nick, we were reflecting on the night before and my dad suddenly texted wishing my sister and I a safe trip and all that good stuff. I finished my text to Nick and was replying to my best friend who I had already been texting prior to my dad. While I was texting my best friend, I received a question mark reaction (iPhone) text from my dad, which left me confused for a split second because I haven\u2019t responded to him yet. Low and behold, of course I sent the inappropriate text to me dad instead of to Nick!!!!!!!\n\nFML!!!!!! I am mortified to say the least! My soul left my body. I screamed my lungs out for the next 10 minutes, trying to decide if this is the sign to jump off the bridge. \n\n\nSorry dad, you don\u2019t deserve more gray hairs. \n\n [Screenshots of the text](https://imgur.com/gallery/XVHO9O2)\n\nYou\u2019re welcome to cringe with me and laugh at me.\n\nTL;DR sent my dad an inappropriate text that was supposed to be for my partner.\n\nUPDATE. This blew up way more than expected. I hope you all had a great laugh at my mega cringe moment. \nYes, I\u2019m OK. \nThank you to all that reached out and were concerned for my safety. I will get tested as soon as I get back home from my trip and yes I will end the relationship.",

            "Something similar happened to me about decade ago. My college bf was over and after we had sex I guess he just threw the condom away in the bathroom trash. The next morning my dad comes up to me and says something like, \u201cit\u2019s fine if you want to have sex and I\u2019m glad you\u2019re being safe, but next time please flush the condom.\u201d I was completely mortified and started apologizing, figuring he had seen it in the trash. He said it wasn\u2019t a big deal ...except that our dog loves to eat things out of the trash (she would eat used tissues, etc.). Apparently she had gotten into the trash, eaten the used condom, and then pooped it out in the morning when my dad took her out. Thankfully my dad has a good sense of humor (and our dog had a strong stomach).

            "One time I had sex with someone new, and he tried to go for it without a condom. I told him three times in different ways he needed to use a condom, and he finally went out to his car and got one. He came back with the package of condoms, turned off the light, and we had sex. I didn\u2019t realize till afterwards that he had never put on the condom. I was so shocked and confused by the situation, I didn\u2019t say much about it. (I hadn\u2019t had much experience and had NEVER had sex without a condom before.) The next day when I brought it up, also over text, he was a huge asshole while pretending to be so nice and made me feel gaslighted. \n\nI ended up taking a pregnancy test and also got tested for STDs. Years later I still hate thinking about that experience, especially because there are so many things I would\u2019ve done differently.\n\nI know this wasn\u2019t the focus of your post, OP, but it makes me feel a little better that I\u2019m not alone!",

One of us hides a big glass diamond and the rest go hunting for it. \n\nClues are given as to hot/cold and if it\u2019s fish, bird or in between. All goes well. It\u2019s her oldest turn to hide. He\u2019s 8 and his little sister is 6. \n\nThe rest of us wait in my study, and then go out searching for it. We end up in my bedroom. I start to realise there are som drawers that are not for kids... as I don\u2019t have any of my own, my apartment is not kid friendly in that regard - and I kind of forgot to set rules up in where we can\u2019t hide stuff. \n\nBreathe out as I realise it\u2019s an in between search.

She opens it - is overjoyed. She found the diamond!!! \n\nHer mum and me almost fell over laughing, because below that diamond we were all hunting for was my freshly refilled stash of condoms... \n\nLucky for us the kids were to busy to think about the next best hiding place to ask us what was so funny. \n\n... oh.

My PC was still using its internal mic to pick up my audio because I didn\u2019t mute myself in the teams call like I was supposed to.

So I had a friend that was a pretty shady guy but a good friend nonetheless, we'd known each other all through high school, we sorta went our separate ways after graduation but would occasionally call just to check in or go to a party together. \n\nSo one day he calls me out of the blue and he says \"hey man I'm in a tight spot do you have a onion I can buy real quick\" I look in the fridge and say \"yea I've got 4 how many do you need?\" he says \"damn bro I didn't know you had it like that, I need one for now but might need more later how much you gonna charge me\" I tell him just give me a dollar and he gets super excited like \"hell yea man you've always been a good friend bro\" he says he'll be there in 30 minutes and we hang up.\n\nOf course I'm thinking why tf is he so excited about a fucking onion... Whatever maybe he's making meatloaf and forgot to buy onions. So he pulls up 30 minutes later and I go outside with the onion in my hand feeling pretty good about helping my friend out. He flips tf out like \"WTF IS THIS!! ARE YOU TRYNA RIP ME OFF!! ARE YOU A FUCKING FED!! I'm standing there confused as fuck\" bro you said you wanted a damn onion what's the problem\" at that point I think he realized what was happening and says \"fuck you bro you wasting my time\" and speeds off.\n\nStill in a state of shock I go in the house thinking maybe he want a different type of onion than the one I had. I call my dad and explain the weirdness of what just happened he laughs for a good 10 minutes straight TURNS OUT a \"onion\" is a unit of measurement for cocaine and \"a dollar\" in that context means a hundred dollars which is way below the market value. Who knew? Never talked to or heard from him again (he's in prison now) \n\nAnyway there must be something about my demeanor that screams drug dealer because all throughout my adult life people have just assumed I had drugs for sale, especially at parties but sometimes just randomly on the street. It's weird af but I've just gotten used to it at this point. I remember some really old guy when I was 11-12yo telling me I'd make a good drug dealer something about his seriousness and tone made it seem almost like a prophecy and it stuck with me. \n\nTldr: my drug dealing friend wanted to buy an onion, he meant drugs I thought he meant an actual onion.\n\nEDIT: so to answer a few questions... \n\nMy dad knew because of he grew up in the projects of LA he has MS now so he's not dealing or buying but he certainly did in his younger days.. According to him up until I was around 5 years old. \n\nOnion = ounce \n\nApparently most people have either never heard it used in that context or use it for an ounce of weed, maybe he meant that idk.\n\nI'm 6'2, black, dreads, heavy, and generally wear loose but well fitting clothes",

I did it for him! I was just mad because he was ignoring me basically the whole threesome then was ignoring me and texting HER. I posted this on TIFU because I know this is on me. never asked for advice\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd.\n\nupdate: We talked about it and I just told him how i just didn\u2019t expect the night to go like that, i got jealous, and I felt like he wasn\u2019t showing me enough attention. He told me he just \u201cgot excited\u201d because he knew it was a one time thing, hes sorry and maybe threesomes aren\u2019t for us lmfao. I showed him that nobodies better than the original -*joseline voice*- and as far as the texting, he said he\u2019s not texting her so i\u2019m just going to trust him and forgot about that.\n\nedit 2: IM BISEXUAL! I like girls and my boyfriend is the first man i ever dated. It was definitely supposed to be a threesome, not 2 straight girls and 1 straight guy. they just excluded me. tbh i think she\u2019s not as gay as she says but that\u2019s on me.",

            "Oh man\u2026\n\nSo when planning a 3some, it should never be a surprise to anyone. With you and all the other people involved, WITH YOUR CLOTHES ON AND WITHOUT DRUGS OR BOOZ, y\u2019all need to talk about boundaries, wants, and expectations. A safe word like how they use in kink wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea, so that if someone feels left out or whatever they can let it be known without it being a conversation. \n\nBTW if you can\u2019t bring yourself to have this conversation, then you should never ever attempt something like this. If you can\u2019t talk about what you want to do with the people you want to do it with, then you aren\u2019t ready to do it.\n\nThat said, whenever there\u2019s an odd number in a group sex situation, there will be moments where one person is left more as an observer. Sometimes you won\u2019t know how you feel until you get into that position, but you should be aware that you might be in that position and mentally prepare for it. This is why a safe word can be useful so you can \u2018tap in\u2019.\n\nAlso, the third in a 3some is not an NPC side character/supporting role. They are going in with their own fantasies and desires which everyone should be aware of and willing to accommodate. A huge problem that unicorns can find themselves in is when a couple uses them for their fantasies and leaves them unfulfilled because to the couple the sex was for them and they could care less about what the special guest star wants. \n\nAlso also, one night stands/one night of sex/stuff like this aren\u2019t throw away moments, even if they are not good experiences. Your BF and your friend shared an intimate encounter. She may be moving away but\u2026 well that doesn\u2019t mean either or both of them would or do think of that night as disposable as you expected them to. \n\nThis is one of them moments where you learn in hindsight. 3somes can work\u2026 but not the way that you did it. \n\nMy advice is to talk to your boyfriend, like really talk. He technically hasn\u2019t done anything wrong here, because you provided this experience. That said he may not realize how you were feeling then or now. If you don\u2019t hash this out and come to an understanding about how you both feel, (because his feelings may not be what you think they are) then this relationship is gonna tank for sure. This could be a moment you could grow closer\u2026 but only if you talk. \n\nThe mistakes you made here are classic blunders for folks who want to try 3somes. A \u201crule\u201d I have found that might help in the future is when considering stuff like this, as yourself and your partner \u201cwill this bring us closer together, or further apart?\u201d I don\u2019t think that question was asked here at all. \n\nLife lessons are always painful. Good Luck!",
            "This rarely works out well.",
            "As a general rule (not hard and fast, pardon the pun, but on average)... Threesomes are usually more successful (and by that i mean don't cause long term issues in a relationship) with strangers than with people you are in a relationship with. Before I get downvoted into oblivion, read this whole comment.\n\nPeople in relationships, especially long term ones, can be sensitive in ways strangers are not. If you see two strangers laughing, your first thought isn't \"are they laughing at me?\" Or if you see two strangers share a look, you're not likely to care if they have plans to hook up later. Or if they do something you aren't familiar with or comfortable with, you won't see them in a negative light.\n\nWhen you are in a relationship, everything your partner does with someone who isn't you (either romantically or sexually) will weigh on you if you don't have a strong sense of self and 100% comfortable in your place in the relationship. You'll second guess every glance, every touch, every action that he/she has never used on you. It is an experience that millions of men and women are curious about, but few ever navigate successfully.\n\nBased solely on this post, I have to assume that you didn't think this through. I wish you well, but honestly I don't think you get through this without talking to a professional.",

Go online and order it. \n\nFast forward yesterday, things don\u2019t always as planned and in a nice civil way I got dumped right before Christmas. Yesterday was also a rough day at work so a pretty hard bad day overall. So I woke up this morning ready to start working from home due to COVID.

We are a joking family. \n\nBackstory: our kids woke up super early so we made them breakfast, turned on the TV and went back to bed for a quick sleep in. \n\nPresent story: \nOnce they were bored with the TV they came in to our bed for cuddles and basic shit talking (as kids do. Omg can they shit talk)\n\nAfter a few minutes I asked if everyone wanted McDonald\u2019s and everyone agreed. \n\nI told my 7yo son that he would have to walk to the store (it\u2019s roughly 500 meters away but you have to cross a busy road to get there) with his 4yo sister to get breakfast for everyone. \n\nWhile he was suspicious of this joke request he kept asking \u201cdad? Do I really have to do that?\u201d\nAnd I would reply \u201cyes, mate. We\u2019re both tired. Could you go get us breakfast please?\u201d\n\nThis went on for a few minutes and then I laughed and said \u201cdon\u2019t worry mate. I\u2019ll get it\u201d then went and had a shower. \n\nWhile I was in the shower he had a complete anxiety attack about having to walk to McDonald\u2019s and my wife said he was hysterical for at least 5 minutes. Like a full blown, inconsolable panic attack. \n\nHe actually thought I wanted him and his sister to walk to McDonald\u2019s to get breakfast. He\u2019s such a sweet kid. \n\nTL;DR told my 7yo kid he had to walk to McDonald\u2019s to get breakfast for the family, was joking but he has a complete anxiety attack about it and I feel like shit.\n\nEdit: for those suggesting my actions were extremely terrible. when I say we are a joking family I mean that this kind of play happens all the time. \n\nEven my 7yo will pretend the TV is broken only to \u201cprank\u201d me. This was an unprecedented turn of events and he would have usually called me out on my BS. \n\nThis is why it\u2019s a TIFU and not an EVERYDAY I FUCK UP.\n\nEdit 2: thank you for the hate mail and suggestions. Holy shit, some of you are redacted. Only some. Most of you are level headed, responsible people.\n\nEdit 3: holy shit. Did not expect this to even make a ripple in the water. Which it hasn\u2019t but in reddit standards, whoa!\n\nEdit 4: I\u2019m no longer answering replies or DMs as it appears the I\u2019m worst parent on the planet and need to be schooled by random internet users. \n\nSorry for not responding. You can blame the experts.\n\nEdit 5: thank you for the people hitting up my inbox telling me not to worry about hate mail. You guys rock.",

In this instance, we were waiting in line for the Mission to Mars ride. Stepdaughter is so transfixed with the entertainment during the wait. We finally get to the door where we're allowed to board the ride and the ride-handler appoints her the Pilot of our ship. She takes this all in and she's super quiet about it.

        "selftext": "This happened 2 weeks ago and I\u2019ve only just stopped cringing entirely when I think about it.\n\nMy boyfriend and I were visiting his (quite conservative) parents house for the weekend. I took a shower, and I remember feeling really smug because I remembered to bring all of my cleansing stuff with me, including my new cleansing brush. For anyone that doesn\u2019t know what it is, it\u2019s literally a small handheld electronic contraption with a brush at the end of it, and does a better job of cleansing your face and leaving your skin smooth af than if you just used a flannel. \n\nAfter using it, I wrapped myself in a towel and was sorting out my shower bag when I had the amazing idea of detaching the brush from my cleanser, and leaving both parts on the windowsill to dry. It\u2019s important to note that I had the contraption body facing away, towards the window, so you could only really see the handle and then the back of the \u2018head\u2019 of it.\n\nAnyway, everything\u2019s fine for a couple of hours - boyfriend and I are sitting in his bedroom when his dad knocks on the door, gives me a really shifty look and then asks for \u201ca word\u201d with my boyfriend. We both looked at each other weirded out, but my boyfriend obliged and went outside to the hallway.\n\nAfter a few moments he comes back in a bit red in the face, sits down on the bed and says \u201cwhy did you leave a sex toy in the bathroom?\u201d  Obviously I was perplexed, saying I REALLY had no idea what he was talking about. He was embarrassed rather than accusatory, and explained his dad had briefly described it as \u201cpink with a big bulb\u201d and then it hit me.\n\nI too, went bright red and laughed rather uncomfortably as I explained what it was. Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t realise his dad was lingering outside the door still. \n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to lie BloatedRabbit, it\u2019s ok but just next time don\u2019t leave it around for everyone to see.\u201d\n\n\u201cI swear on my life it\u2019s a face cleanser!\u201d I said, rushing up and retrieving it with the brush attachment. I handed it over and he looked really sheepish and apologised, and we both had a bit of an awkward laugh about it. My boyfriend then decides to take the jokes up a notch and say how stupid his dad is, and how he\u2019s a dirty old man for thinking like that. His dad got a bit defensive, and his response still makes me want to crawl into a hole and die when I think about it.\n\n\u201cWell I\u2019m sorry, but it looks just like one of your mother\u2019s toys!\u201d \n\n\nI\u2019m not religious at all, but when I say I wanted God to beam me up there and then... I\u2019m not kidding. I felt like jumping out the window. The whole energy of the room shifted. His dad made a hasty retreat as my boyfriend stood there gobsmacked, and we didn\u2019t dare leave the bedroom again for the next couple of hours.\n\nWorst part was we had a family dinner that night, and his mum asked me about the facial cleanser and where to buy one. My boyfriend and his dad put their forks down at the same time. Talk about awkward.\n\nTL;DR I left my facial cleansing brush on the windowsill of my boyfriend\u2019s conservative parents bathroom. His dad found it, thought it was a sex toy, and when boyfriend took the piss he accidentally revealed it looked like one of my boyfriend\u2019s mum\u2019s toys.",

        "selftext": "I'm a doctor working in the ER and there are a lot of COVID patients every day. I know the routine of putting on all the protective gear, the masks, the treatment- this wasn't my first rodeo with COVID.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe patient is older, and is currently hypoxic (not getting enough oxygen), and I am suspecting a super infection with bacterial pneumonia on top. At first the patient is on 3 liters of O2, but the nurse calls me in because she can't get an arterial blood sample and it needs to be done with ultrasound to find the artery. Get into all the gear, go in with scanner, get the sample, evaluate the person, increase oxygen, get out and confer with my attending, get all the COVID regiment going.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe patient desaturates again- oxygen saturation needs to be above 95% in people with no lung diseases- above 92% can be acceptable in COVID cases. The patient is at 84%. On goes the gear, new arterial blood sample, increase oxygen, stabilize the patient.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRinse and repeat until I've been into the room six times to stabilize the patient, who is quickly getting worse. I know the protective gear, it's like a reflex to put it all on correctly by now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut the patient is still getting worse, so I put them on high flow oxygen treatment, 35 liters of flow and 35% oxygen levels. I talk to the ICU, because this patient is rapidly deteriorating and there is ONE spot free so I nab that like a greedy little gremlin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust before the patient is getting transferred, the O2 levels drops again to 68% and the nurse calls me in a panic to tell me that the patient is crashing. I rush into the protective gear, get in there and crank the high flow to the max. Eventually I manage to stabilize the patient enough for transport and they go to the ICU- an hour later they're on a respirator.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYay me, right? The next day however, my attending pulls me over and asks me what sort of mask I was wearing when I went into the patients room on that 7th time and my heart just fucking plummets. I stutter out \"I was wearing the wrong mask.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn a high flow air treatment, you have to wear an FFP3 mask. I only wore a regular surgical mask because that was the only mask at the gear station.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think back on how I leaned over the patient to get the arterial blood sample with the ultrasound scanner. I remember how I held the patients hand, telling the patient we were doing everything we could and we were going to transfer to ICU. I remember the patient coughing, me standing right next to the bed, just breathing in the COVID fumes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll the times I've seen COVID patients, all the times I've put on the correct gear and this one time I managed to screw up. Currently at home in isolation, waiting for the COVID tests, while all my colleagues are working their butts off at the ER.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR I am a dumb doctor at work, forgot to wear the right protective gear and got coughed in the face by a COVID patient. COVID sucks, wear your masks.\n\nEDIT1:\n\nAlso worth noting, and because I've gotten a few messages about it- the standard PPE for covid or suspected covid cases is different from place to place, as are the procedures. Where I work the standard gear is a face shield, a surgical mask, gloves and a coat, which is only to be worn once.\n\nIf there is a risk of aerosols, such as high flow air treatment or cardiac arrest treatment, we are allowed to wear FFP2/FFP3 (N95 and N99) but they are also only for one time use. These sorts of masks will not be at the PPE stations unless there is a need for it.\n\nEDIT2: Thank you all for your kind words and well-wishes! You are all wonderful people who make me feel a little better about the situation. I am waiting to get tested on the 4th and 7th day of exposure and hopefully they will come back negative so I can get back in the field. And then I will NEVER forget to put on the right gear again!\n\nAnd to all my fellow healthcare workers; stay safe out there!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast edit here: I tested negative on my 4th and 7th day after exposure, so I am in the clear! And I waited an hour in line today to get my covid shot. Patient is still on a respirator, but is on the way to recovery and hopefully will pull through.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks again for all your well wishes and wonderful words. \n\n&#x200B;",

            "A piece of advice from a healthcare worker during the ebola crisis \n\nThis post is for my healthcare workers, docs, surgeons, Nurses, aids, and EMS, and all staff.\n \nThere is no emergency in a pandemic.\n \nYou as a healthcare worker are a force multiplier. Your training and experience is invaluable moving into this crisis. So, you\u2019re going to be faced with some very difficult moments. You\u2019re going to have to put your needs first.\n \nI\u2019m speaking specifically about PPE and your safety.\n \nIf you\u2019re an ICU nurse, or an ICU doc, and you become infected, not only are you out of the game for potentially weeks (or killed). But your replacements could be people without your expertise. Your remaining co-workers are short staffed now, more likely to make mistakes and become ill themselves. You stop being a force multiplier and start using healthcare resources.\n \nYou going in may save the patient, it may not. But you cant save any patients in the weeks you\u2019re laying in a hospital bed or using a vent yourself.\n \nPeople are going to die. Do not become one of them.\n \nThere is no emergency in a pandemic.\n \nDuring the Ebola outbreak, people were dying. But at no point did we rush in, we took the 10 minutes to put on our PPE with our spotter. If we didn\u2019t have proper PPE we did NOT go in.\n \nThere is no emergency in a pandemic.\n \nYou may work in long term care, and want to rush in to save a patient you have had for years. Do not go in without your PPE.\n \nThere is no emergency in a pandemic.\n \nYou may have a survivor in the room, screaming at you to come in because their mother is crashing. Do not go in without your PPE.\n \nThere is no emergency in a pandemic.\n \nYou may have an infected woman in labor. Screaming for help. Do not go in without your PPE.\n \nThere is no emergency in a pandemic.\n \nYou may have a self-quarantined patient with a gunshot wound who is bleeding out. Do not go in there without your PPE.\n \nThere is no emergency in a pandemic.\n \nDoing nothing may be the hardest thing you\u2019ve ever had to do in your life.\n \nMany of you say, I could never do that. I wouldn\u2019t be able to stop myself from rushing in and saving my patient.\n \nLiberian nurses and doctors said the same thing, and many did run in to help, saying PPE be damned. My patients need me.\n \nThen they became infected, they infected others. And they died.\n \nThey didn\u2019t help anyone after that.\n \nDo not let the deaths of hundreds of healthcare workers be forgotten.",
            ">TL;DR I am a dumb doctor at work, forgot to wear the right protective gear\n\nThere is one fundamental rule of occupational safety: *Sooner or later everyone has a dumb day.*\n\nDoesn\u2019t matter how smart you are, doesn\u2019t matter how much experience you have... every single one of us will eventually do something stupid. If the only thing keeping you safe is not being stupid, accidents are inevitable. That\u2019s why PPE is the last line of defense after all other controls - it\u2019s the most prone to human error.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry this happened to you. It\u2019s horrible luck that the time you goofed happened to coincide with a serious danger. I really hope you are okay, and I hope you\u2019re not beating yourself up about it. You were clearly doing your absolute best in a really tough situation.",

            "Oh honey, you are stretched thin, stressed out, trying to save patient after patient with limited gear, on too much information,  overstimulated and exhausted.\n\nDo not beat yourself up right now. You need to keep your own blood pressure stable.  You need to take this period of isolation to drink plenty of water because you know damn well you're dehydrated. You need to cut down on your stimulation to give your nervous system a break, so do something that is calming, and gives your mind the best rest you can. That can mean calm music, engaging in a calm hobby, whatever your version is of the opposite of your intense job is. Eat food that makes you feel good, not stuff you grab to shove in your mouth in a hurry. Make yourself food, sit down to eat it. SLEEP AS MUCH AS YOU WANT!\n\nLook, resting and taking care of yourself right now will give your body the best support possible to help you remain as healthy as possible. Even if you don't develop covid from this exposure,  taking the time to rest now that you're being forced into it means you will be better prepared to go help your colleagues with a fuller battery.\n\nThank you for everything you do.\n\nI promise I wear a mask every time I leave the house.",

Also, as I'm sure you are aware, even if you test negative, isolate like you are positive until the 10-14 day mark. Good luck friend.",

            "No such thing as an emergency in a pandemic. Make sure you have all your PPE on and secure before entering the patient's room and then treat them to the best of your ability. \nAlso, 35%/35 LPM high flow settings? Cmon man, if they're desatting treat with O2 if air hungry add flow. We go to 6 lpm, 15 lpm high flow nasal cannula, and then either nonrebreather mask or Optiflow at 80% 40 LPM or 100% 40 LPM if needed. Check a d dimer and heparinize if needed, and diurese as tolerated. Also auto prone, melatonin, vitamin D, zinc. \nSounds like the patient was cruising for a tube anyways, don't hesitate to intubate if needed (SPO2 <88% on 100% FIO2 with high respiratory rate and an increased chance of tiring out or the increased risk of hypoxic injury with delay of intubation procedure). Patients with PO2's in the low to mid 50's on 100% O2 are gonna get better sooner by being proned and paralyzed rather than waiting and hoping they ride it out.",

I had this COVID + restless deaf and blind man who would not stop getting out of bed, haldol didn't work and of course his ativan was ordered as PO instead of IV. I can't communicate with this man to take any pills. I finally got IM Geodon and it still didn't put him down yet. All night, whenever I thought he had calmed down, I'd gown out and then 2 minutes later bed alarm would go off. Well, one time I go in there, he's coughing, im there maybe 15 minutes  pushing his legs and arms back in the bed and realized I only had on my surgical mask. I run out of there and put on my n95 and face shield. I never had that happen before. Well its been over a week and no symptoms.

It's still preprint, but the group is legit.\n\nSeveral hospitals are reserving PAPRs and n-95s for HFNC, NIPPV, or mechanical ventilation, and advocate surgical masks when patients are only on nasal cannula. But evidence of patient-to-caregiver transmissions indicates surgical masks are insufficient protection. They work somewhat, but not good enough to rely on.\n\nI've given up on hoping my hospital would do the right thing, they would rather insist surgical masks are safe in a coughing patient on nasal cannula, than provide all healthcare workers with appropriate ppe. I settled for buying the fellows PAPR hoods and the residents n95s, and telling them to wear full PPE with any covid patient, regardless of \"aerosolizing risk.\"\n\nIt takes a lot of mental retraining to avoid rushing in for a crashing patient. Whenever we get new residents to the COVID unit, I remind them that there are no emergencies here. They need to secure PPE first, even during a code. Health care workers are a force multiplier in the fight against COVID, and if they get taken out by COVID for 2 weeks, that can translate to worse patient outcomes as the system becomes further strained.",

So the narrator describes the characters' actions inbetween dialogues like, \"Sister comes up and touches his hands\" and whatnot. \n\nHad it been any other shows or movies, my wife and I definitely would had caught this mistake instantly. But of course, the Black Mirror always fucks with our minds, so we just went with it and hypothesized what the voice could be, and what the episode was trying to tell us. \n\nI think we came up with some absurd ideas like episode is about how we don't really have free will, only chosen ones can hear this voice, the narrating voice is the hacker, etc. We were basically focused only on the voice in the sky the entire episode. \n\nWell, the end was near, and came the twist. Normally, we would have gasped at the revelation (more surprising because there were subtle hints throughout), but not this time. We were like yeah, yeah, that's cool, so what was the voice? And to our complete and utter shock, the episode was over without any explaination about the voice.\n\nWe were quite dumbfounded at this point, because as complex as Black Mirror episodes go, we could at least understand the basic message it was trying to tell us, but this time we couldn't grasp anything. After some thinking and talking, we cut our losses and just moved on to the next episode where we soon found we are too dumb for this show.  \n\nTl;dr turned on audio description, thought it was part of the show and got really confused.\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit: mostly lurker, I don't know if there are any etiquettes I have to follow through, I will upvote everyone's comments for now.\n\nFor those who says it's not TIFU, I guess it's mundane, that's true. Since some folks are okay with the change of intensity? Of fuck up, and so are mods,  I am at peace with it.",

            "This reminds me of the time I read the book I Am Legend. My fiance had been recommending the book up & down, saying how much he loved it. I had already seen the movie but I love books so figured yeah, let's read this thing! Well unbeknownst to me, the copy he owns is merged with short stories written by the same author. The short stories are at the end of the book, and there are probably 4-5 stories meaning 4-5 extra chapters. There is literally NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE END OF I AM LEGEND AND THE BEGINNING OF THE SHORT STORIES. No \"THE END,\" no title page for the new story about to begin, nothin. So I read the end of I Am Legend, and kept reading thinking the book wasn't over yet. All the short stories were bizarre, one about witches in the woods, one about a guy getting weird phone calls - they were so off topic from I Am Legend that I was confused, but excited that it was somehow going to turn around in some amazing plot twist. By the last page I was so mad - I put it down thinking \\*what the holy hell was that\\*, a completely unsatisfying feeling when finishing a book. The whole reading experience was tainted and I don't think I have gotten over it yet, haha. I really wish I had gotten to enjoy that book for what it is!",

            "I'm blind also. You need to watch Borat with description, if you can stomach it.

It actually makes the film way more funny.",
            "I did this accidentally with Orange is the New Black and I instantly knew it was a mistake/not part of the episode because the opening title sequence is a bunch of close ups on mouths/eyes/faces in really fast sequence.

            "I remember when I was a kid, we rented Alien, the first one, from the library in town.  My sister, cousins, and I were really excited because we hadn\u2019t seen it and were really looking forward to it.  We get it home and pop it into the VCR only to realize that it was an audio description version for the blind, it was written on the box, but we weren\u2019t paying attention to that...  anyway we finished the movie but 100% of the suspense was gone since every time Ripley did ANYTHING, the narrator would describe it in detail.  \u201cRipley is crawling around a corner.............the alien is right in front of her..............Ripley runs away.",
            "This reminds me of when I watched Tron: Legacy with the descriptive audio services turned on.

On the third book I assumed there was a fourth, un released book I would have to wait for.\nI didn't realize my mistake until years later I watched the movies and there were all these scenes not from the book. Looking back through the books I realized they were 3 books, but each book was two books. Basically I read the first half of each book and didn't realize it.",
            "You should try this again with (the Black Mirror movie) Bandersnatch.",
            "I had a similar issue with the Bandersnatch episode. \n\nIn case you don't know it's the most recent black mirror episode where you make decisions for the main character (you have two options to chose from).\n\nWatching this on Netflix in my TV I had no clue you had to choose, I just tought the episode had weird moments in which the action stopped for dramatic reasons or wtv. So yeah, it restarted several times and I was too sleepy to let it continue and never finished the episode. \n\nWeeks or even months later I'm at a friends house and we talk about black mirror, and I felt like the world's biggest idiot when he asks me \"What was your favorite ending\"?

            "This happened when I watched the Black Mirror episode White Christmas. Woulda been a hilarious weird one-off but I\u2019d just watched The Big Short the previous week (unknowingly with audio description on) and was shocked that they both had come out, used the same -very- unique stylistic technique and NO ONE was talking about it.\n\nI realized my mistake after Black Mirror ended and told everyone I knew about the existence of audio description tracks. Because the whole experience was mind-bending and hilarious.\n\nThat being said, the folks who do the audio description are extremely talented individuals. Both the examples I saw were full of humor and added a lot to the experience of watching. As far as I\u2019m concerned, that\u2019s the way they were meant to me seen. Or at least how I was meant to see them.",

            "I thought bandersnatch was a pick a path style movie, not a pick a path interactive visual story. So like an hour in ive seen some super cool twists and endings and cant for the life of me see what the \"correct\" path would be, but I'm getting annoyed that it only ever picks the left option. Then i bump the mouse and the right option is highlighted and I realise im supposed to be making the choices. Now the suspense is destroyed. It's no longer an entertaining ride full of twists and turns. Suddenly its more like a test, or luck or whatever. Completely ruined it for me and I couldn't finish watching.",

            "My wife and I were staying at a cabin for the holidays and turned on A Christmas Story. To our surprise, there was a narrator (beyond the usual one). We thought we somehow stumbled upon a version with story book like narrating. Once it ended and the next thing began...we realized what was going on. Either way, it is kind of my favorite way to watch it now."

        "selftext": "This fuck up took place 15 years ago when I was around 11 years old.   I had recently seen my father's penis for some reason as little boys often accidentally do.  It got me thinking about how small my penis was.    I decided I needed to do something about this.   I did some google searching and somehow learned about penis pumps.   \n\nNow, my 11 year old self didn't really understand what this term meant.  I however knew that I had a penis, which had a hole, and I had a pump.   The pump I had, was a soccer ball pump.   The ones with the little metal needle.  Well I examined my dick hole and determined it could accept this metal object.   I stuck it in, it hurt a little bit.   I decided the pain would be worth it.   I pushed the pump handle down and pumped air in.   It inflated my urethra like a little balloon.   Since I was 11, I was not an anatomy expert.   The sensation gave me an erection, so I decided it must be working.  I inflated again.   It hurt a little this time, and now it felt like I had to pee.   I wanted results though, and people always say \"No pain, no game.\"   I pushed the handle down again.   Now I really fucking had to pee.\n\nI removed the needle and hobbled off to bathroom.   The sensation had given me a full on erection, the kind where it is hard to pee.   However, I really fucking had to pee.   I pushed super hard.   No man other than me likely knows the feeling of farting piss out of their penis.  I get to claim that I guess.   The air mixed with urine created a sprinkler effect spraying piss everywhere as the air and pee mixture escaped violently.   It really hurt my dickhole.   Amazingly the dickhole was not meant to rapidly expel air from a dick balloon.    I can confirm now that if a woman blows into your penis during a blowjob, you will not die.   Check mate weird middle school boy story tellers.\n\n15 years later it still hurts when I pee occasionally.  I am considering going to a urologist one day, however I am not sure how to address the issue.   The last thing I would want to tell a medical doctor is the actual reason why my dick hurts every now and then.  \n\nTLDR:   I thought my penis was too small so I inflated it like a balloon.    It hurt when I peed.  \n\n",

            "I got a prostate infection as a result of a kidney stone, and my prostate swelled up to the point where I couldn't pee (felt like a knife in my dick every time I tried.) Went to the ER and they said only option was a catheter. About as thick as a sharpie marker. Now, imagine your prostate/dick tube being so swollen you can't even got liquid out without feeling like glass in your thing.  \n  \nSo the nurse starts pushing it in and it's uncomfortable but manageable up until HOlY SHIT THE PAIN IS ALL I AM. I started screaming and she stopped, waited a moment, then oushed again. I screamed and wailed and begged her to stop. I will never forget the bored look in her eyes as she said \"they say you have to keep knocking until someone answers the door.\"  \n  \nI have no conception of how long this took but I remember a crowd of 4-5 doctors and nurses gathering in the room to watch and see what the commotion was since they could hear me from all around the ER. I will never forget the moment she fknslly popped my dick hymen. It was one of the worst things I have ever felt and I'm pretty sure this is the reason I still have some pain when randomly when peeing to this day. It took me about 20 minutes to get out of the bed because the catheter inside me hurt so bad. When I finally took it out 5 days later every piss for a week was like rubbing the inside of my penis through a cheese grater. It would take me half an hour to finish peeing.  \n  \nAnyway my point is you nay have damaged your prostate if you still have pain, may want to get that checked.",

Cracking night etc, but the following morning I comfort my sister crying. She ends up telling me my Aunt's BF slept with our god-sister at the wedding night. \nMy immediate response is, well gotta tell her, it's what I'd want if it was me. \nI go talk about it with my parents who know, and dad says it's not his business (he's a very \"too himself\" type of guy, don't want to get involved) but I plead with my mother saying it's her sister, it should come from her. She tells me not to and if I do \"I'll disown you and never talk to you in my life.\". \n\nWe then found out she was pregnant with his kid, another nail in telling her coffin.\nSo I keep my mouth shut.\nThis is my first fuck up, as I myself am very unconcerned about what others think, as long as I believe truly, I'm doing the right thing.\n\nI vent about it to my SO and explain what my mum said etc, she understand but still think I should find a way to tell my aunt without it being pinned on me.\nI thought about it to many a night.\n\nCutting to the chase, 7-8 months go by and still no one has said a thing, He(cheat) prances around like he owns the place, and My god-sister believes she's got away with it.\nWe had a small family BBQ to celebrate birthdays, (well within the social distancing rules in the UK)\nAll going fine until I overhear Cheat saying something on the phone, \"Yeah I'll see you later, stop calling me until I call you\" on phone with GS.\nSomething in me snapped and I asked if my aunt wanted to go shop with me.\nAs we are walking she could tell something was wrong. She kept pressing me to say, I told her it would ruin her life.. so I did, I told her, knowing how she would react, knowing it'll be me to get the blame for any fallout and me taking the brunt of hatred from everyone. But I did, and do believe it was the right thing to do.\n\nAnd the fallout was crazy, she confronted him, he came at me, throwing me against a car, smashing a vase on my leg(3stitches(first time ever)) threatening my family, my mum not talking to me, just, hell let loose..fear of what my aunt would do if left alone.\n\nAs much as I regret not saying anything sooner. I'm glad I did tell her, because how much long would it have been before anyone did?\n\nThis is my first post here, probably won't be my last. Thank you.\n\nTL;DR:. Told my aunt her BF was cheating on her after months of knowing, hell broke, needed stitches.\n\nEdit: \n\nFirstly; God-sister is the term we used for her to describe her, it's because she's my god-mothers daughter, that's just the short cut to it, not a cult or such, apologies for confusion! It adds to the insult towards my aunt as she was basically like a sister to Me, and a niece to her too.\n\nSecondly, I'm male 5'8\" while this guy was near on 7' and built like a brick shithouse. Not going to take a fight I know I'll lose (especially with cameras on me)\n\nThirdly, in terms of legal actions, I know I have some evidence(Injury, CCTV footage off of the neighbours etc) but my first thought is making sure my aunt and cousins are okay.\n\nForth, my aunt has since had the baby, I wasn't too sure how far along she was when I was told she was pregnant, believe end of 1st trimester.\n\n\nTo all saying it doesn't belong her etc, I hear you, but at the time of writing, I felt as if I had fucked up, with the treatment I got, I felt this was the appropriate place for it. \n\n\n\nI'll get back with an update on this thread when I know what's what, \n\nThank you all for your concerns, opinions and the awards, even though some of your thoughts go against my actions, I still respect you for voicing them! \n\n\nLove to all",

Unless they are the exception to the rule, men who start hitting keep hitting. Both my ex\u2019s cheated and hit (I know, I know...poor judgement on my part to not have learned after the first one - too young, low self esteem) but I did\u2019t find out about the cheating til after we split. But I sure as shit wish I would have. It would have kept me from marrying them and would have saved me black eyes, bruises the size of cantaloupes, trips head first down the stairs, kicks to the stomach after being thrown to the ground...the list goes on. I ignored the violence because I was young, \u201cin love\u201d and STUPID. Plus, it didn\u2019t really \u2018ramp up\u2019 til after we married but it was always there. There definitely were enough angry fights that should have clued me in as to what was down the road for me. It\u2019s a miserable life to be afraid to come home at night and there is so much heartache leading up to the hopefully eventual divorce. I\u2019m sure it hurts and is confusing to you why you\u2019ve been made the bad guy in this but please know you absolutely are not. I\u2019d be willing to bet most women would want to know if their man was a cheating prick so they could kick him to the curb and find a better one. And as the saying goes, \u201cfor every rat you do see, there are 50 you don\u2019t\u201d. Who knows how many women he\u2019s been with since he started dating your aunt?",

        "selftext": "Obligatory this did not happen today. This happened on Thanksgiving about 15 years ago when I was a young lad. My family always goes to my one Uncle's house, and they have a big basement with a light switch at the top of the stairs. Me (22m), my brother, my sister, and my 8 cousins always played a game which we called \"Monster in the bathroom\". The game is just hide and seek, but all the lights are out and the people have to make a noise when the seeker asks them to. Also, we never play it in an actual bathroom, no idea why we call it that.\n\nSo we play a few games, the lights start on so people can find a good place to hide while the seeker stands at the top of the stairs and counts down. When they are finished counting, they turn out the light and make their way down the stairs to find people. My oldest cousin was the seeker this game, and he's kinda known as the funny one of the bunch so I was presented an opportunity to out humor him.\n\nAs he was walking down the stairs, I suddenly got the urge to fart. I could tell this was a mammoth of a fart just by feel, so I was dying for him to ask for us to make a noise. Finally, as he got to the bottom of the stairs and screams loudly \"MAKE A NOISE!\" Trying to get a laugh out of everyone. Not to be outdone, I released the loudest and wettest fart I had ever released in my young life. Every single person hiding burst into hysterical laughter, including myself and the seeker.\n\nAfter the laughing died down, I realized my FU. My legendary fart was actually a shart, and I had wet shit dripping down my leg. The other FU was that even though everyone else stopped laughing after 30 seconds, I couldn't stop. I laughed so hard that I also pissed my pants. My cousin immediately caught me, and it was revealed that I had simultaneously shit and pissed my pants. The game ended right there, because I had to go upstairs and borrow pants and underwear from my cousin.\n\nNow, every single year when my family arrives to Thanksgiving, every cousin comes up to me and yells \"HEY MAX30070, MAKE A NOISE!\" This has not gotten old to them, and I will be arriving at my Uncle's house in about 2 hours. I will undoubtedly be asked to make a noise, as it is a Thanksgiving tradition from here till the day I die.\n\nTl;dr Played a game of hide and seek in the dark, was asked to make a noise, accidently shit and pissed myself, now I am reminded of it every Thanksgiving by cousins.\n\nEdit: my cousins are currently trolling me by saying \"lol dude this happened last year\" so at the ripe age of 21 I shit and pissed myself guys. GG me I guess.\n\nEdit 2: My sister just linked this to her Instagram story. Now everyone I know is gunna know this story lol\n\nEdit 3: Thanks for reading and to everyone who enjoyed my story! My mom can't believe a story about me shitting myself became this popular lol. I posted this because I was sitting on my couch waiting for my family to get ready and thinking about how I was gunna get trolled when I got there. Then I thought it would make a funny TIFU story. Sorry to the people I haven't responded to, I got tipsy and lost track of everything. Happy Thanksgiving!",

Me and my now boyfriend were in the car with our two kids driving to a nearby convenience store. He parked and got out just running inside to quickly grab something, I don\u2019t remember what it was, and I\u2019m just sitting there waiting and not really thinking about my sudden stomach cramps when it  hits me. Slow at first and then getting more and more intense. Now it\u2019s after dark and I have two young kids in the car so obviously I can\u2019t just race into the store to shit and quite honestly I don\u2019t think I would have made it anyway. I\u2019m thinking maybe I can just stick my ass out of the door and let it rip and nobody will notice but we\u2019re in a pretty busy parking lot and people are noticeably going in and out. I\u2019m in plain view. I see an old McDonald\u2019s bad on the floor of the car and briefly contemplate if I could just somehow manage to shit in the bag I\u2019d be fine but I was slowly admitting defeat because all I could do was sit there and just clench my ass cheeks as tight as I could manage to prevent this catastrophic shit spill! By now I am in so much pain from holding this sucker in I can barley breath. My stomach is cramping and the pain is agony. I\u2019m just praying that my boyfriend comes out of the fucking store and floors it so I can at least make it home. Finally he comes out and looks over at me like \u201cwtf are you actually doing?\u201d I\u2019m crying I\u2019m getting so flummoxed and did I mention the pain!? Finally I manage to squeak out \u201cI have to fucking shit like a racehorse! Let\u2019s go!\u201d He\u2019s still kind of looking at me not taking me seriously and meanwhile I have my ass lifted off the seat in a plank position still clenching my butt cheeks together in one last desperate attempt to keep this thing in. All to no avail. I shit. Everywhere. Literally a massive puddle of shit and piss on our car seat, all running down my legs and onto the floor amassed in my yoga pants. All I hear is him hysterically laughing at me until we pull up to the house and I\u2019m waddling inside completely mortified that something like this could happen. I showered it off and cleaned up the car but that shit stain was there as a reminder until we eventually got a new car. I laugh about it now but I was 25 at the time, a grown ass woman crapping her pants. I don\u2019t wish this on my worst enemy.\n\n\nI apologize for the lengthy comment but I felt it was suited here. Hopefully it gets a good laugh out of someone.",

        "selftext": "Unlike most TIFU posts, this happened just half an hour ago. \n\nI'm a 21 year-old male. I was out running my 2 miles. Headphones in, music playing, minding my own business. I round the corner at about the halfway point of the run and I see this big black duck looking at me. As I get closer, I think to myself, \"Man, that's a brave duck, why isn't he running away?\" I keep running and realize the duck not only isn't afraid of me or running away, he's running right at me. So I stop and squat down, thinking maybe he was hurt and needed help or something. This bitch ass giant fucking black duck takes a huge bite out of my leg. Like, not playing, drew blood kinda bite.\n\nI'm thinking to myself, \"What the fuck?\" So I'm like, maybe he's just an asshole and I keep running think he will leave me alone. I start running again and the faster I run, the faster he chases me. I start sprinting and he is literally flying behind me attacking me. I'm thinking, \"I've got enough fucking problems in my life as it is man, I don't need this shit\" so I stop running again kinda like in disbelief trying to figure out what to do. In all my years of being a person, I've never trained for this.\n\nThis little punk ass duck is chomping on my ankles and it's actually really hurting. He starts grabbing my shoelaces and untying them as I'm trying to run backwards away from him. We've covered a quarter mile at this point. I try picking him up and throwing him back away from me every time he lunges for blood. I'm thinking, \"How the fuck am I gonna explain this if I have to go to the doctor for a duck attack? I'm a grown ass man. This is bullshit.\"\n\nI try running again and he keeps flying after me. I'm at a loss. I don't know what to do at this point. I'm manage to get my phone and start texting my girlfriend, asking her what to do. Am I really gonna have to kill this duck to get away? Like, I don't want to, but I might have to actually fucking kick this duck or grab it by the neck? Seriously?\" We have covered 3/4 of a mile at this point. He bites me again and I drop my phone. I pick it up quickly. Who do I call? I've got fucking scars and cuts all over me. While I'm debating whether stand-your-ground laws apply to ducks, I hear a noise; Someone else was outside walking on an adjacent street and came to see what all of the commotion was.\n\nThis was a big mistake. The duck smelled blood, and gave up attacking me to chase after my savior. I saw my window and booked it home running the last half mile in 2:50 flat. I feel kinda bad, that duck has probably killed that dude by now. The last I saw of him was the look I took over my shoulder running away as he made the same mistake I did, looking down to see if the duck was hurt.\n\nI cannot make this shit up. I would have recorded it, and I tried, but it's really hard to concentrate on unlocking my phone and trying to record video while you're being eaten by a fucking duck.\n\nThis is bullshit. I'm covered in cuts and bites. Most joggers are afraid of getting attacked by dogs, but this is something I was not ready for.\n\nTL;DR I'm a grown ass man and got attacked by a giant duck and chased for over half a mile. I'm covered in blood.\n\nEDIT: A small amount of proof from the initial moment of not realizing what was happening: https://imgur.com/a/SxZ7Y\n\nEDIT 2: ITT: People what don't understand the difference between can't fight a duck and *not wanting to fight a fucking duck.*\n\nEDIT 3: Not dead yet.",

Arch your back to keep your face out of being-bashed-by-a-wing zone if necessary. \nHold fucking evil duck firmly by the neck and clamp it against you to get the wings under control. \nWorks with geese too but their wings hurt more when they bash you with them.\nNever been close enough to a swan to need to test this on one.\n\nGet yourself to a doctor, OP. \n\nI hope it never happens to you again, btw.",
            "I\u2019m truly sorry you were assaulted by a duck but with that being said, that was the funniest shit I\u2019ve read in awhile. \ud83d\ude02 ",
            "Bravo for not hurting it. I looked at the pic you posted before reading the story and you're obviously a guy. Thought to myself, \"What the fuck? How did he let this happen? As a guy, but never having done so, could easily fend off a duck.\" But then I started thinking about what if said duck wouldn't stop? Would I be willing to hurt it if things got \"serious\"?  After reading your post, I would have done the exact same thing. ",
            "As a kid, we kept ducks, geese, swans, turkeys, and chickens on our farm. A lot of them can be assholes that wanna hurt you. You think a duck is scary? Try having a swan bent on killing you. No joke, they use them to guard junkyards in some places. They can break your legs with their wings. That is, unless you know the trick to dealing with an angry water fowl. They can only really hurt you if you allow it. By backing away or trying to avoid hurting them in the process of defending yourself, you allow them to get the advantage. Next time that duck comes after you, step right into the fight and let him know that you aren\u2019t fucking around. You wanna squat down to his level and hold your hand out far in front of you. Hissing is optional. He will target the part of you that is closest to him. He will start by trying to bite onto your hand and then he will try to beat you with the \u2018elbows\u2019 of his wings. Don\u2019t worry, they have no teeth and only the tip of the beak is capable of doing any damage. When he tries to do that, you wanna grab him by his head, using your hand to hold his beak shut, and gripping round the base of his neck. As soon as you have a firm hold, you start spinning. The centrifugal force will force him away from you and he will attempt to fly, but it is not possible. About three quarters of the way through your spin you can release him. He will tumble backwards and you will feel like a monster and worry that you hurt his neck. You didn\u2019t. Water birds are incredibly sturdy. At this point, he will realize that you are not to be fucked with, but his pride will require him to lower his head and hiss a bit. If he approaches again, stomp your feet hard on the ground in front of him. It might take a few stomps, but eventually he will relent and walk away. When he does, he will do this little chattering ka-kwak-ka-kwak-ka-kwak sound if he has truly given up. It is duck code for \"I need sympathy\". Once you get some practice fighting ducks, find a swan pond if you are ready for a real challenge. Same technique, but much higher stakes. If you need further coaching, I can be found at Walden Pond on Saturday\u2019s from 10-2. I have 94 consecutive knockouts and hold the world title in the Water Fowl Division. ",
            "Seriously why didn't you just grab it and kill it? ",
            "I'd like to think the modern epoch hasn't so twisted my instincts that I'd actually start texting people as I was being attacked by something...",
            "This has to be the best tifu I've ever read. This even tops the kid who fucked a coconut",

            "If you are ever attacked by an animal you should defend yourself with a level of force appropriate to the situation. It's perfectly within your rights, just like it is to defend yourself from a fellow human being. Go see a doctor. An animal of such puny size and strength attacking something at least 100 times larger than it is might have some sort of disease that's hampering its brain functions and may be communicable.",

        "selftext": "this happened 30 minutes ago. literally. \n\non mobile so forgive me for my sins. \n\nso, my beagle/pug mix is 19 years old & he's been my best friend my whole life cause I'm 22. so he's all old & fucked up. been hit by a car more than once. \nanyways, I was cleaning my T-bone steak of all it's fat. the fat came out to be about an 8 inch long strip, since it wrapped all the way around my steak. I thought, \"man, Buster sure would enjoy the shit out of this steak fat!\". so I proceed to walk my happy-ass out onto the porch, where my beloved ancient pupper resides. I proceed to lay this strip into his bowl, where he (QUICKLY for his age & condition) gimps his old self over to it. let me add; he's not one to just swallow some shit whole, so I didn't expect this, but I suppose he was feeling risky. so he's all excited as shit, gulping down this strip of fat, inch by inch. I'm watching him eat it cause I'm all stoked he's enjoying himself & feeling good. \n\nthis is where it goes south. \n\nthe little fucker didn't think about how many swallows it would take to down this 8 inch strip of steak fat. he's running short of air & starts swaying, stumbling around like a drunk Irishman.   I instantly take action & start heimliching the fuck out of this little sausage link of a mummified dog. it was enough force to make the end of this fat strip peek out of his throat. so I grab the fucker & tug it out. he's unresponsive & his eyes are all rolled back. I'm FREAKING THE FUCK OUT. so i start giving him CPR. (I don't know how to do CPR for humans, let alone a dog, but I gave it my best shot). so he starts breathing again & looks at me like \"what the fuck just happened?!\". the amount of confusion on this dogs face is something that will be seared into my brain til the day I die. he lays there for a second & I rub his neck (assuming it might be sore from the good tug I gave to that t-bone fat strip). & this little fat fuck of a canine gets up as fast as he went down, walks over to the fat I ripped from his throat, & starts going at it again. but much slower & more cautious this time. I monitored him the whole time & then got him some water to wash it all down. I gave him some love & he went to sleep. \n\nmy life is seriously going to be very uneventful & boring when he leaves us. \n\nTL;DR I brought my 19 year old beagle pug back to life after he deep-throated a 8 inch long strip of t-bone steak fat.\n\nedit; wow, thank you for the silver, kind stranger ;-;\n\nedit; this post blew up. thank you so much for all the love, very pleased to know so many enjoyed.\n\nEDIT; everyone loves Buster so much, I've created an Instagram for him that I will be posting on regularly. link is in the comments cause idk if my p9st will get taken down if posted on main post. you wanted da cult? you got da cult. many more posts to come.",

            "This is way better than my fuck up doing almost the same thing. I gave my oldest diabetic cat some beef fat from rib bones at Franklin barbecue (well known as the best barbecue in Texas and potentially the USA) and my cat ate the fat and then ate the bone whole in one bite.\n\nI don\u2019t know if eating the bone was the exact cause of my cats decline, but she stopped eating not long after that and I think it may have gotten lodged in her intestines. I never did get an x-ray to confirm, but my other cat ate a bone also at the same time and had no issues. She ended up going into a diabetic coma not long afterwards and stopped eating. I did take her to the vet a few times which got her blood sugar in check, and if it was lodged she would not have been a good candidate for surgery at her age as it was. \n\nIt ended up that her last day was spent in my lap all evening and she didn\u2019t want to leave. In the morning she tried eating again and I would have taken her to the vet that morning if she didn\u2019t. That got me hopeful, but when I came home she had passed away. I just am glad that on her last night she was able to completely relax and spend the evening on my lap getting petted. It was one of the best nights we ever had together. She didn\u2019t want me to stop petting her and I literally couldn\u2019t go to sleep because she would keep nuzzzling me for more \n\nSorry, for the sad post, but I don\u2019t plan on making this it\u2019s own story post.

According to two different vets many terriers have a low grade case of this all the time if they are eating standard dog food and possibly table scraps.  I was pretty suspicious of the need to buy the high dollar low fat food, but when both were perfectly okay with us ordering the food from Chewy.com rather than buying it from them I felt better.  Our dog, who is about 8 years old and never fluctuates in weight, seems to be much healthier.  Lots of energy, and never has the hard abdomen he used to have on a regular basis.  It\u2019s Royal Canin Low fat food by the way.  Both vets also said it can kill rather quickly or really shorten lifespan.",

        "selftext": "A few days ago I decided to visit my dad at his house. It was his birthday. I showed up with wine. We got a little drunk. Maybe more than a little. When my dad was done going on and on about how much he missed my mom since she divorced him, he changed the subject and focused on my love life. He asked if I had a gf and I said no. Then he asked if I've ever had a gf because he's never seen me with a girl. I said never. My dad poured the last drop of wine in my glass and asked if I was still a virgin. I was tempted to lie, but I paused too long, so I said yes. My dad said I had no reason to feel ashamed about my virginity, but encouraged me to have as much sex as possible before I end up married to a person whose vagina comes with an impenetrable encryption. I ignored the obvious reference to my mom's you-know-what and called it a night. \n\nI asked my dad if I was allowed to sleep in the spare bedroom because I didn't want to drive home drunk. My dad said I was more than welcome. I must have been sleeping for less than an hour before I woke up to the sound of my dad knocking on the door. I don't remember what I mumbled as I opened my eyes, but the moment my dad heard my voice, he entered my room with another person. It was a girl. My dad introduced her by name, but did the air quotes thing with his fingers to imply that it was a fake name. I could tell my dad was still drunk. Exhibit A, he continued making the air quote gesture, even when it was no longer neccessary. Not gonna lie, I was still drunk too, but not drunk enough to disregard the weird fucking shit that was happening. Without giving me proper time to react, my dad quickly said the girl knew exactly what to do before closing the door on his way out. \n\nThe girl did not know what to do. She did nothing other than awkwardly waiting for me to say something. I eventually asked her what was going on and she said my dad hired her to sleep with me. I died of embarrassment, especially when the girl asked me to explain if I was on the zero experience or the some experience end of the virgin spectrum. Without thinking, I said I was gay. It was the first time I actually said it out loud. The girl sat down on the bed and asked if I was a top or a bottom. I shrugged and said I didn't know yet. My face must have been so red at that moment. The girl said if I was willing to go shower, then she would basically be willing to motorboat my butt. To be honest, I considered it. I'm human. I'm horny. However, the situation was way too weird for me to be completely comfortable doing something that sexual with someone I didn't know at all. \n\nI said thank you but no thank you to the girl and apologized for my dad putting both of us in an awkward position. She said she understood and for some reason thought it was neccessary to mention that my dad was one of their regular customers. She made it clear for the record that she never had sex with my dad, but explained that some of her older coworkers at the escort service really enjoyed spending time with him. She said she can't wait to tell the other sex workers that she met me because apparently my dad loves to talk about his son with the people he pays to fuck. I was not psychologically prepared for the unexpected discussion regarding my dad's sex life. The girl had a severe case of motormouth. When she finally stopped talking, I learned that my dad sleeps with sex workers who kind of look like my mom and that women closing their eyes with too much food in their mouth and saying \"hmmmmmm\" turns him on. \n\nThe girl apologized for abusing my \"good listening skills\" and asked if there was nothing she could do for me. I said she could keep my sexuality between the two of us. She said her lips were sealed until the time comes to suck cock. My dad was passed out in the living room when we approached the front door. I went back to bed when the girl was gone and eventually fell asleep. The following morning I confronted my dad. I said I didn't appreciate what he did and made sure he understood that he wasted his money because nothing happened. My dad was apologetic and promised never to cross that line again, no matter how much alcohol is involved. Despite his apology, the mood was still somewhat tense. I decided to break the tension by closing my eyes and saying hmmmmmm while eating breakfast. \n\nThe look on my dad's face was priceless. I lost my appetite soon afterwards because I instantly regretted doing something that might arouse my father. \n\nTL:DR Told my dad I was still a virgin and his response was to blindside me in the middle of the night with a sex worker who realized I was not into girls and ended up telling me more than I wanted to know about my dad's history with other sex workers.",

Suddenly, though, to my surprise, the ants from enclosure one ran into their little hill, seemingly going into hiding.\n\nAround twenty minutes later, some of the large soldier ants from enclosure two began to poke around inside the hole to the hill of enclosure one. Chaos, and I mean utter fucking chaos ensued... The ants from enclosure one began pouring out into the sand. I didn't even know there were so many in there. Within seconds, they were fighting, the soldiers from enclosure two tearing them in half like fucking maniacs.\n\nAt this point, I really wanted to intervene, desperate to stop the brutal madness, but it was too late. With almost all of the solider ants from enclosure one laying bloodied and decimated, one of the soldiers from enclosure two made a move for the hill's sandy entrance. This girl was absolutely huge, almost a third as big as the Queen. Noticing the attempted attack, the surviving worker ants from enclosure one moved in on her position from the surrounding sand. They piled on her, literally covering her entire body, biting into her with vicious fury. Yet, she kept moving, entering the small hole like a damned tank.\n\nAt this point in the war, I didn't have a clear view of the battle which was taking place within the hill. I tired to rotate the connected enclosures, but, alas, the siege was taking place in a sandy part of the hill.\n\nAfter around ten minutes, I see the soldier ant from enclosure two's ass, backing out of the hole, one of her back-left legs missing. To my absolute fucking horror, she begins to drag the queen out of the hole by her head. All the while, she's biting down into the soldier's seemingly impenetrable skull with everything she has, her workers still climbing all over this absolute monster.\n\nAfter a good minute of tugging on enclosure one's Queen, thrashing from side to side, her insides being bitten into, the soldier just jerks the hell backward. In this single, decisive tug, she tears the Queen's head right the hell off. She then turns, examines the corpses of her fallen sisters, who've died in the meantime, and she simply begins to walk away, the Queen's decapitated head held within her mandibles, a trophy of war.\n\nAs of now, enclosure one has no Queen, and only twelve workers remain, from what I can see anyway. The solider, believe it or not, is still very much alive. She's returned home to enclosure two, with the Queen's head in tow. She's resting inside the hill, beside her own Queen, preparing for possible retaliation.\n\nI've disconnected the two enclosures, but I honestly don't know what to do now... It's the most brutal thing I've ever witnessed, and I feel like I've just fucked up an entire world with nothing more than a bit of plastic tubing...\n\nTl;DR - I decimated an entire colony of ants by allowing another colony to behead their queen...\n\nI'll try and add pics when I get home from work.\n\nUPDATE!\n\nAlrighty. Here's a pic of enclosure one's battlefield, and the many bodies, some of which have recieved a soldier's burial (many of the black spots further toward the hill). I've also added a pic of Kratos, the ant Slayer, but she's currently in hiding, and a little tricky to see, you know, with the mass genocide and all... Her lil murderous ass is circled, next to her Queen. \n\nBattlefield of the dead https://imgur.com/gallery/UvNDZKY\n\nKratos, Slayer of ants https://imgur.com/gallery/q8WCgQ1\n\nSorry the pics aren't terribly dramatic lol. My phone's camera sucks. \n\nAlso, I was being coy in some of my comments with regards to my writing, as I'm always deeply nervous about sharing stuff with the outside world, but I'm actually an author of horror, thrillers, and weird fiction. With that said, I don't know if I'm allowed to share my links here, but my pen name on Amazon is Jennah Walters. So, if you want to check that out, it's up to you. \n\nScrew it. If Kratos can slaughter an entire race, I can sneak in a link and toot my own horn. \n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Jennah-Walters/e/B07DCHDJMQ%3Fref=dbs_a_mng_rwt_scns_share\n\nThank you all so much for the kind words, premium, and awards. I hope you have an amazing day. I'm sorry I can't reply to all your comments. There's just too many, and the constant phone vibration is making my coworkers think I'm smuggling a sex toy. \n\nI didn't expect this post to blow the hell up like it did lol. I'll make sure to keep caring for my ants as best I can, while maintaining a healthy level of fear toward the one they call Kratos!\n\nFinally, I just wanted to say that you've all made my day. I expected to maybe entertain a few people with this story of events, but, damn... Also, yes, I know Kratos is a female. \u2665\n\nUPDATE! Many of you kept asking for a short story retelling of these events, so I went ahead and did just that. You'll find the dramatic short story/flash fiction of Kratos, the ant slayer, below. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/user/CascadeThrowAway35/comments/p3yoy7/kratos_the_destroyer/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share",

            ">In the first age, in the first battle, when the shadows first lengthened, one stood. Burned by the embers of Armageddon, his soul blistered by the fires of Hell and tainted beyond ascension, he chose the path of perpetual torment. In his ravenous hatred he found no peace; and with boiling blood he scoured the Umbral Plains seeking vengeance against the dark lords who had wronged him. He wore the crown of the Night Sentinels, and those that tasted the bite of his sword named him... the Doom Slayer.\n\n>Tempered by the fires of Hell, his iron will remained steadfast through the passage that preys upon the weak. For he alone was the Hell Walker, the Unchained Predator, who sought retribution in all quarters, dark and light, fire and ice, in the beginning and the end, and he hunted the slaves of Doom with barbarous cruelty; for he passed through the divide as none but demon had before.\n\n>And in his conquest against the blackened souls of the doomed, his prowess was shown. In his crusade, the seraphim bestowed upon him terrible power and speed, and with his might he crushed the obsidian pillars of the Blood Temples. He set forth without pity upon the beasts of the nine circles. Unbreakable, incorruptible, unyielding, the Doom Slayer sought to end the dominion of the dark realm.\n\n>The age of his reckoning was uncounted. The scribes carved his name deep in the tablets of Hell across eons, and each battle etched terror in the hearts of the demons. They knew he would come, as he always had, as he always will, to feast on the blood of the wicked. For he alone could draw strength from his fallen foes, and ever his power grew, swift and unrelenting.\n\n>None could stand before the horde but the Doom Slayer. Despair spread before him like a plague, striking fear into the shadow-dwellers, driving them to deeper and darker pits. But from the depths of the abyss rose The Great One, a champion mightier than all who had come before. The Titan, of immeasurable power and ferocity. He strode upon the plain and faced the Doom Slayer, and a mighty battle was fought on the desolate plains. The Titan fought with the fury of the countless that had fallen at the Doom Slayer's hand, but there fell the Titan, and in his defeat the shadow horde were routed.\n\n>And in his terrible rancor between worlds and through time, the Hell Walker found the wretch who shall not be named, but in his heresy was loyal to his evil cause. The wretch adorned the Doom Slayer in a mighty armor, wrought in the forges of Hell, impenetrable and unyielding. With sword and shield of adamantine strength, the Doom Slayer set to banishing all that were left unbroken by his savagery to the void. Yet as the mighty Titan fell and dread engulfed the armies of Doom, the demon priests of the Blood Temples laid a trap to capture this scourge of Hell. Insatiable, even by the vanquishing of the Great One, the Hell Walker sought prey in the tombs of the Blood Keep. And blinded by his fervor, the lure drew him in. The priests brought down the temple upon the Doom Slayer, and in his defeat entombed him in the cursed sarcophagus. The mark of the Doom Slayer was burned upon his crypt, a warning to all of Hell that the terror within must never be freed. There he lies still, and ever more, in silent suffering.",

Especially when it comes to normal body functions such as pooping, burping, and farting. \n\nAnyway, one day about six months ago, I thought I was being really cute rocking the \"winnie the pooh\" (shirt w/ no bottoms.)  It started with a casual conversation while my husband was sitting on the toilet. I was standing outside of the bathroom, while the door was open, and we're just chatting. I look at him straight in the eye, trying to be cute, and I went for a \"toot.\"\n\nGuys. This was not a fucking toot that came out of me. I looked my husband dead in the eye, thinking that I was cute and silly, THEN SHIT ON THE FUCKING FLOOR. Yup. Literally sharted. And because I was rocking the T-Shirt with no pants look, it had no where to go, but the floor. I was DEVASTATED. I thought I might be looking at divorce. I've never felt so humiliated. \n\nHusband here: At the moment of release I was looking her dead in the eye. I was expecting to hear a gnarly ass fart... all I heard was a wet plop/thud noise. It took my brain a second to process it, but as soon as I did I found myself looking at my wife in sheer/horror disbelief. The love of my life just shit on the floor like a filthy fucking animal. She turned bright red and slammed the door. I just sat on the toilet in disbelief.\n\nTL;DR I tried to he cute and toot with no pants on, and I shit on the floor while looking my husband dead in the eye.",

Never had an issue.\n\nToday I went in for lunch and the line for the drive thru was wrapped around the building, so I said fuck this imma go in and eat.\n\nThe line inside is long to 6, so I utilize the order online feature, and wait. \n\nThat poor woman didn't even realize when she went to call my name. I wasn't expecting it. I forgot all about signing up with my Google account. \n\n\"DIXIE NORMUS\"\n\nI felt worse for her than I did myself, the whole room stared at her, and I saw her show the receipt to co workers.

About 3/4 through the lesson the sub realized he was gone and she started asking where he went, quite insistently:\n\n\"Where's Mike Hunt?\" Over and over, not understanding why we were all trying to suppress our snickering.

I am currently sitting in the hospital, alone, feeling defeated. I have done this to myself. \n\nSo I\u2019ll start with some backstory. I\u2019m a closeted gay 18 year old boy living with his parents. I\u2019m in high school, but just got off for Christmas break. About a month ago, I was scrolling through Wish (that shopping app where everything is insanely cheap) to see if I could find any funny gifts to get my family for Christmas. Though, lots and lots of sex toys kept popping up. I had never purchased one and since they were so cheap, I figured \u201cWhy the hell not?\u201d.  It was a small dildo. \n\nIt took about 3 weeks to arrive, which was actually earlier than expected. I wasn\u2019t surprised, since most of my past orders from Wish came sporadically. I opened it up and it reeked of a chemical odor. I expected there to be some smell, assuming that it was made out of silicon, but damn did it smell awful. I took a shower that day and decided to clean it thoroughly while I was in there. The smell never completely went away, but it got less pungent. \n\nWhen I got back to my room, I started searching for a good place to hide it. My room has endless nooks and crannies to hide things in, so it wasn\u2019t really an issue. I placed it in a shoebox in the corner of my closet and left it there. \n\nFast forward to today. I had completely forgotten about the dildo because school had me constantly busy and worried about a million different things at all times.  But now it was Saturday, christmas break, and a ton of free time on my hands. I was laying in bed on my phone and randomly remembered about it, so I decided I would finally use it tonight. \n\nThe night rolls around, and both my parents went to sleep. Perfect. I went in my closet, pulled out the dildo, and pulled up some porn on my computer. It was all going well for about 30 minutes, until I felt an itch coming from inside my butthole. I pulled it out, looked at it, and there were ANTS crawling out of the dildo\u2019s pee hole. The makers of the dildo thought it would be a good idea to put an actual hole in the dildo for some godforsaken reason. I didn\u2019t know how to react, so I just sat there, staring at it for a good 30 seconds. After my brain processed what the fuck had just happened, I ran to the bathroom and sat on the toilet. I tried to push, but nothing felt like it was coming out. I kept trying for a couple minutes, but still nothing. So I finally stood up, bent down to flush the toilet, and saw AT LEAST 50 ants just chilling in the water. I. Was. Mortified. \n\nI could still feel that itch in my butt, so I decided I needed to go to the hospital. I didn\u2019t want any ants crawling up my god damn rectum. I wasn\u2019t about to tell my parents what happened, so in my frantic state I just left.  Got in my car, and went to the hospital. \n\nSo here we are. I can definitely say telling the doctor what happened is the most embarrassing thing I have ever had to do. I\u2019m writing this here because I need to tell someone what happened. My parents are at home, sound asleep, probably dreaming about me leaving for college. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do when they wake up, I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ll be here, I don\u2019t really know what the hell happens after this. \n\nFuck me.\n\nTL;DR: Used a cheap Chinese dildo. Put it in my closet, ants invaded it like suburban moms invading the hand sanitizers at Bath & Body Works. Used it, ants up the ass. Chilling at hospital.\n\nEDIT: The long awaited update is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/eeecdy/tifupdate_by_trusting_a_cheap_chinese_toy_to_do/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf).",

            "If you\u2019re being honest, I apologize in advance - but I gotta say - this story is quite hard to believe.   There\u2019s no reason why ants would hide in a sex toy (or survive long in there if they did). They\u2019re seeking food pretty much constantly and if they were in there to start, it\u2019s unlikely you could keep them in there even if you wanted to!  If you washed it thoroughly in advance it\u2019s hard to believe that you wouldn\u2019t see some sign of the problem in advance. Ants in your ass isn\u2019t the kind of thing they would keep you in the hospital for - unless they were a dangerous species.  I would imagine they would send you home with some preparation H and tell you to wait it out. Ants wouldn\u2019t survive IN your ass long enough to still be causing problems by the time you saw a doctor.  The worst possible outcome would be slight itching and swelling.  You\u2019d be more traumatized from the embarrassment than anything else.  Things that would make sense:  severe bacterial infection, allergic reaction to the materials, something needing to be extracted by the doctor, electric shock from plug in toy....   there\u2019s a kernel of a good Reddit yarn hiding in here :)",
            "I will be the first to say it: no way this actually happened.\n\nLet's assume that the dildo actually had a hole and some ants got in it. Without a source of food and water, the ants would all be dead within 1-2 weeks. There's also zero chance that the ants would decide to nest in just a single solitary dildo.\n\nBut even if that were true, what are the odds that the OP didnt see ants when he pulled it out of the package, and had it in the shower, and magically the ants pour out the second it gets up his butt...",

Buy from reputable retailers and manufacturers.\n\n- silicone is the only soft material for sex toys that is not only non-toxic but non-porous. Other toy materials can harbor bacteria, or even leach plastic softeners into the body as they slowly break down. You cannot stop this, not even with a condom, so it's ALWAYS better to stick with safe sex toy materials.\n\n- **lastly, pics or GTFO, there's no way a manufacturer would have given enough of a crap about a cheaply made non-silicone toy to add a urethral hole deep enough to hide multiple ants inside it.**\n\nSource: mod of r/SexToys, work at a toy store for close to 5 years, own 2 suitcases of toys myself.",

Lets call her Lizzie. Anyways, i was fairly tired at that moment and only glanced over the bio. This was the fuckup. \n\nLizzie and i match and get to talking. She is really nice, into the same nerdy shit i am, a fantastic shitposter, good conversationalist. and Very,Very cute. I'm thinking she is already my next girlfriend assuming things go well when we meet.\n\nCouple days later we go on the date. Now, I've been catfished before, so I'm already expecting that she won't be as cute as she was online. Nope. She shows up looking fantastic. (Just like in the simulations!) We get sushi and are having a good time, so we decide to go back to my place. \n\n After a drink, some anime and good conversation, we start making out. Things are getting...heavy so we go into my room, she takes off my pants and starts giving me head. Awesome.  She took off her bra, not flat chested either, double awesome. (BIG TITTY GOTH GF REEEE) Anyways I'm not the type to keep a girl waiting on her knees. (*tips fedora*) So i ask her to get on the bed and we make out some more and i go to take off her skirt. The next few moments were something like this:\n\n\"Uhh... whatcha got there..?\"\n\n\"Oh my god i thought you knew\"\n\n*windows shutdown noice as my boner collapses*\n\n\"..nope. I had no clue\"\n\nSoooooo, she had a dick. Turns out, she did say she was trans in her bio. Pre op.  Been on hormones for a while and is going to make the switch. While im not transphobic or homophobic, i do have boundaries. I didn't freak out or anything. I assured her its fine, y'know shit happens. We ended up getting dressed, knocking back a few more shots and exchanging life stories until she sobered up and went home. Ended up friends after all was said and done. \n\nAlways. Read. Bios.\n\nTLDR: didn't read a tinder bio, got my dick sucked by a pre op trans girl. Took off her skirt, saw a dick.\n\nEDIT: This is my first ever post on reddit. Cant believe its made so many people laugh. Glad more people got something out of my potentially awkward situation!\n\nEDIT: A lot of people asked if i would consider dating her post op. Yeah. Why not? I felt like we hit it off. \n\n UPDATE: she replied.

        "selftext": "Mandatory this didn't happen today, but rather a few years ago...\n\nBack when I was at Uni my best friend (James) and I used to always try prank each other creatively by getting on each other's Facebooks/social media. Think things like messaging our friends with odd messages trying to sell them a ridiculous pyramid scheme , changing each other's profile picture, etc... you get the idea.\n\nOne day near the end of my final year, we are in his room about to go for a night out and James goes to the bathroom, leaving his laptop unlocked (with facebook logged in). I take this as my opportunity to execute my latest master plan - I was going to change his post settings on facebook to \"only me\" (i.e. his posts would be invisible to anyone else) and post something outrageous and completely inappropriate (knowing he has his family on facebook). Plan was that he would come in, see the post and freak out / get super pissed, for me to reveal the gaff to him and have a laugh.\n\nHowever, I only managed to execute the first part of my plan (i.e. changing the setting to \"only me\") before he came back into the room, and I had to quickly exit facebook to avoid being found out.\n\nNow, the fuck up was that we went out, got quite drunk, came back home, and I COMPLETELY forgot about this prank. Fast forward to almost a year later...\n\nMy friend is still at Uni (doing a masters degree) while I have moved to another city and started working. I should add that James is a big time electric guitar player, and in the last year got into recording videos of himself and posting them on youtube / social media. He messages me one day asking what I thought of his latest video on facebook. I went to his page and noticed there was no post... in fact, there were no posts for around a year...\n\nI call him and tell him there's no post, to which he says that can't be, I posted it yesterday and am looking at the post now. I'm on the phone with him when it suddenly just \\*clicks\\* and I am immediately MORTIFIED - This entire time, I had left the \"only me\" setting on, and he hadn't realised. I hang up to compose myself before calling him back and telling him the truth.\n\nFor the last year or so, he had been posting several videos and had received 0 likes or comments. He had taken most of his previous videos down, had wondered why nobody liked his videos, if people just hated him since most of his friends graduated, if he was really crap at guitar... One thing he told me in particular was particularly heart-breaking - \"I often layed awake at night thinking about this\". I don't want to use the term depression too loosely, but it really affected him and he considered going for counselling.\n\nLuckily he was good about it and didn't hold a grudge, and we now laugh about it. Bought him a lot of drinks next time I saw him though.\n\nTL;DR  Forgot I changed my friend's facebook settings so that nobody else could see his posts, he thought nobody liked him and was mildly depressed for a year.\n\nEdit: Grammar\n\nEdit 2: I should add that I was of course extremely apologetic and remorseful after this happened, and still feel terrible when I think about it. He understandably was pissed at first, but realised it was completely accidental and was just a colossal fuck up. The \"reveal\" itself was over 6 months ago, I was reminded earlier today when I saw an obvious \"stupid facebook prank\". We still talk amost daily, and he is staying with me until he finds a flat once he also moves to the same city as me for work in a couple weeks (will make sure to keep my laptop locked though...)\n\nEdit 3: Just to clarify, he wasn't just starting to play guitar. He has played since he was a kid and is genuinely a great guitar player. During his masters, he started filming cover videos/recordings as a hobby. His videos now get several likes and complimentary comments\n\nEdit 4: So a lot of people have been asking for posting a link to his videos. After watching this blow up, I called my friend and linked him the reddit. He is amazed and wants everyone to know he's fine. He isn't keen on me sharing his actual profile for privacy reasons, but said I could post some (starting with one) of his videos on a separate youtube account and linking it to this post. Here is the cover he wanted to share with me that exposed the fuck up: [https://youtu.be/eH\\_m88IUoVk](https://youtu.be/eH_m88IUoVk).\n\nEdit 5: Final video, a much newer cover he did for his girlfriend: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDpMmSuNoI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDpMmSuNoI)",

            "Ok so when I was 18, me and my buddy would sometimes hang out and get super drunk (like a few times a year, and we didn't drink at all aside from that).  Since his parents had a huge house and he and his sister lived in the basement suite, we would drink there.  \n\nAnyway, one night we did our thing, had a blast, and when we woke up the next morning my buddy and his sister (who was my girlfriend at the time) were like \"uhh....do you have any idea what you did last night??\"  And I had no clue.  they went on to explain that I tried to run upstairs to get into bed with their mom.  They told me they had to physically restrain me from doing so.  I was absolutely shocked. I had absolutely no recollection of this whatsoever.  I quit drinking entirely since clearly I couldn't trust my behaviour.\n\nAnyway, the months went by, to the point where I was no longer super embarrassed about this and I figured I could start joking about it.  One day I went \"lol remember that one time I tried to sleep with your mom\" and my girlfriend (buddy's sister) went \"Oh shit did we never tell you?  We made that up as a joke.  That never happened.\"\n\napparently it was all their moms' idea.",

At least enough to cherish your friendship with him. \n\nI gather it would do both you and your friend good for you to do something nice for him. Acknowledge your friendship with him, a gesture of appreciation in some ways. Even a small gesture would go a long way in balancing the Karmic wheel, na mean? \n\nDon\u2019t make it weird and make it seem like you\u2019re gay for him or anything.

            "Similar thing happened to me a few years back. I was a Division III NCAA cross country and track runner. I lived in a house my senior year with 6 other distance runners on the team. We were a very competitive D3 team with a D1 coaching staff but thankfully our young coach never forced a dry season on us because we competed all 3 seasons (so the whole school year) and trained all summer long. His approach was that as long as we were training hard and being responsible enough to the point where our running and academics weren\u2019t suffering we could party. In an effort to help us make better decisions, if we didn\u2019t compete one weekend we had Sunday morning long runs, but that often didn\u2019t stop us from drinking but it at least kept us from drinking too much (we actually found that morning long runs were the best cure for a light hangover).\n\nThis weekend in particular I decided to stay in. It was late in the season my senior year and I was a lot more focused on running my best during my last semester rather than enjoying my last semester of college. We had a 7am long run scheduled and my roommate came stumbling in drunk at like 1 or 2am and was very loud. I thought he was getting up and getting ready so instinctively flung myself out of bed, turned on my desk lamp and was getting my running clothes on. My roommate had gone to the bathroom and came back to me pretty much ready to go as I was lacing up my running shoes. He looks down at me and says \u201cdude what are you doing?\u201d I was like \u201cuh, we have practice man.\u201d He replied with \u201cnah dude I\u2019m goin to bed.\u201d At this point I could tell he was drunk, I checked the time on my phone and it finally clicked that he was just getting home.",

She began by explaining the difference between manslaughter and murder and begin to tell us of a real case example.\n\nThe lecturer who ended up quite red in the face explained about a couple engaging in some form of roleplay and eventually ended with him fisting his partner. A signet ring he was wearing caught inside her and she unfortunately ended up bleeding to death.\n\nNow comes the fuck up, obviously after this story there was a very awkward silence. Dave thought this break in noise was the perfect time to ask me a pertaining question in his innocence. 'I get why that would be considered manslaughter but why does she keep saying fisting instead of punching?'\n\nThe question was so hilariously innocent at the worst ever time. I'm now sitting cry-laughing unbelievably loudly after this absolute horrible story. It was 100 times funnier like a joke at a funeral because I knew how surreal it must be for everyone else in attendance of me laughing so hard I can barely breathe.\n\nTL;DR: Woman that died from being fisted caused me to cry-laugh in front of 100 people because my friend thought that fisting was synonymous with punching and asked a question about it at the worst possible time.",

One day he started to tell us a story about growing up with an older brother. It was a story about self worth and confidence, and went something like this (read in a _heavy_ Italian accent):\n\nWhen I grew up I had an older brother. Growing up he was always bigger and stronger than me. He used to fist me all the time, and as we got older the fisting got harder and started to hurt and hurt but he would never stop fisting me. One day though, I said enough and started to fist him back. At first my fisting wasn't very strong, but I was determined to fist him back and just kept doing it. One day I finally grew strong enough to fist him back just as hard and his fisting immediately stopped. Every time he said \"fisting,\" he would do a fisting motion in the air with his hands and we were all trying to hold back our laughter. \n\nWhen he stopped talking, the class was silent for about 30 straight seconds. Then in the chat (we were on zoom at the time) somebody posted \"uhh, did you mean to say 'punching,'\" and then posted a link to urban dictionary for \"fisting.\" The entire class erupted in laughter (including our professor) who then had to explain that the Italian word for \"punch,\" basically translates to \"to fist,\" \ud83d\ude02",

It was the funniest kind of over-acting. Then he paused for effect, took a deep breath, and continued with the next verse with even more holy expressiveness.\n\nMe and my brother both tried to stifle the laughter but it didn't work.

Everyone seemed to treat it as the saddest condition causing major life disruption, which it is.\n\nI was able to do that right up until they decided to test physical activity, where two narcolepsy sufferers threw a Frisbee to each other, then almost simultaneously fell to the ground asleep while the Frisbee hit one of them in the head.\n\nDid it highlight a serious condition and some of the attempts to understand the effects of different stimuli?\nAbsolutely\n\nDid it also look like some sort of absurd Monty Python skit?\nDefinitely.\n\nDid I inappropriately laugh out loud, catch the giggles and need to leave the room? \nYes, yes I did.",

We all started laughing but made sure not enough to not be noted by our professor but the professor somehow noticed us and asked us to come to the front and tell him the joke we that made us laugh. And to add to the stupidity of my friend, he recited it out loud and rather than being embarrassed, we all started laughing hysterically and left the hall without even asking the professor and continued laughing for like good 10 minutes. The whole class thought we were on some kind of drugs\ud83e\udd23",

My wife's family always has a softball team every year in their church league and our team consists of my wife, her 3 other sisters, their husband's, my father in law, myself and normally one random girl that normally changes from year to year.\n\nJust a little back story, my wife is 135 lbs but also has a generously large behind for her size and I being a male, enjoy smacking it for obvious reasons. (told you it was a little back story) \n\nCut to me making the 3rd out by catching a fly ball in left center and jogging into the dugout behind everyone. Upon reaching the dug out, I see my wife in front of me walking in. I decided to take my baseball glove, reach back, and slap her on the ass.  Immediately something felt off. I've smacked my wife's ass a lot, she enjoys it and she knows I enjoy it. The reciprocating ripple that normally can be felt when slapping her behind normally was not felt. My wife's sister turns around (who is much much MUCH more conservative when it comes to intimacy or even being premiscoous) and my jaw drops. \n\"I.. Uh... Thought you were.. Zelda\" I babbled \nI start panicking because I just spanked my sister in law's ass in front of the entire game and didn't want to be murdered by my wife. I turn some shade of red and started contemplating how to injure myself so I could get away from my soon to be death. \nLuckily my wife and all of her sisters are practically clones of each other, blonde hair blue eyes, and extremely beautiful (my wife being the best out of them all) they have been mistaken for each of the other ones their entire lives.\nThey all laugh and I am still made fun of every time we play. I now always make sure to look at my wife's face prior to spanking her bottom (in public) \n\nMy wife loves bringing this story up to embarrass me now. \n\nTL:DR smacked my wife's sister on the ass because they all look the same and have the same body types, didn't get murdered but get made fun of to this day for it still",

        "selftext": "Yea yea what a nerd, he collects the periodic table.\n\nWell I do, it\u2019s not the largest but contains some of the more interesting or rare elements. It sits in a display case in my room, and looks like this\nhttps://imgur.com/a/DRj8sjr\n\nSo the fuck up begins when I order the element Cobalt. It has to ship from Italy where I get the elements + jars, and it arrived broken.\nI emailed them, and they responded [in a very wholesome and google translated email](https://i.imgur.com/V5vODvy.jpg) saying they would replace the jar. \n\nSo the jar arrives and I transfer the cobalt sample from some other storage container into it\u2019s designated jar. Everyone would be fine if it stays in the jar. My girlfriend is at my house at the time, and I hand it to her to put in the display case, which she spends a while at.\n\n I assume she\u2019s looking at some of the cooler samples like gold, platinum, or gallium,  I think nothing of it. Later on her hand gets really red and itchy. Like reeallly bad. It looks like she stuck her hand into poison ivy.\nShe\u2019s in a lot of irritation and some pain and I think I know the cause.\n\n\u201cDid you take the cobalt out of its jar\u201d\n\n\u201cYea I held it and looked at it\u201d\n\nI know she did more than that, probably shook it around in her hand or something.\nFor those of you who don\u2019t know, cobalt has an effect called \u201ccontact dermatitis\u201d which basically means, you touch it, and it makes you really uncomfortable. Once you have one reaction, you\u2019ll most likely develop a lifelong allergy. Cobalt also known to cause cancer, but only with frequent contact. \n\nSo now her hand was feeling a bit better but it looked terrible. There wasn\u2019t much anyone could do, so that sucks for her.\nI had to deal with the fact that I handed her a very toxic metal and didn\u2019t tell her. Yay for me. Major fuck up and I\u2019m an idiot. \n\nTL;DR I handed my girlfriend a toxic metal and she touched it causing a painful reaction and probably gave her a lifelong allergy to it. Oh and the metal also causes cancer.\n\n*Edit:* Ok also I want to to throw this in there, that this probably won\u2019t be that much of a problem. She doesn\u2019t want to study chemistry, and how many times in your life will you come into contact with elemental cobalt? Yea, zero. It would have to be pure elemental cobalt, not alloys. She wasn\u2019t mad about it either, we laugh about it.\n\nEdit 2: I need to be more specific about the allergy. Everyone will have a reaction to cobalt. We are all allergic. But after your first serious exposure, you\u2019re significantly more sensitive to it. I didn\u2019t really _give_ her an allergy, I just made her more vulnerable to cobalt. Also, don\u2019t blame her. This is my fault and I should have been more clear. She is a smart person and it\u2019s not her fault. This is TIFU not \u201cToday someone else fucked up\u201d\n\nEdit 3: so more people are expressing interest in element collecting rather than in expressing sympathy for my poor girlfriend. I created a sub, r/CollectingElements to start you people up. In case you were curious, here are my current elements and the _cursed cobalt_ \nhttps://imgur.com/a/QXVH8tk",

When I ask if she's a 45 year old man trying to harvest my organs, she proceeds to send me 15 pictures in a row that look like they're straight from Facebook. Because that's how you convince somebody you're real (not true).\n\n\n\n\nNow normally I don't accept propositions like this because I'm thinking \"what's the catch?\" Well, I decide to live a little on the YOLO side...and since it's right next to a Subway Sandwich shop I think that the worst that could happen is it's a 45 year old lonely man, I give him a big hug because I know the feeling as a 25 year old lonely man, get a tasty sandwich, then go home. Apparently that was NOT the worst thing that could happen.\n\n\n\n\nI show up. She shows up. She's real. I'm surprised. I buy her coffee because I subscribe to traditional gender roles unless requested otherwise. She uses her McCafe frequent buyers card so she gets stamps. Its cute. While the guy is making her drink, she tells me to go find a table outside in the sun. I go outside and find the perfect goddamn table because I'm a romantic at heart. 5 minutes later. 10 minutes later. 15 minutes later. No girl. I text her the typical guy message \"lol u get lost???\". No response. Turns out she took the coffee and left.\n\n\n\n\nSo I'm not saying it's bad to leave a date if you feel uncomfortable or aren't attracted to them. It's totally your decision. But I don't think that's the case...I think this girl is a serial McCafe dater. And I don't think this was her first time. It was too professional. Too clean. It was the perfect McHeist.

        "selftext": "This happened to me 30 minutes ago and I didn't know what to do some I am going to chronicle it here.\n\nIt all started with my son asking if I could use AirPlay to stream some League of Legends games to his T.V. since Worlds are going on. I was reluctant at first since it was almost his bedtime, however I figured what the hell I do things like that all the time so I should go ahead and let him watch until 12ish. He tells me what games he wants to watch and I set up the connection and explain to him that I would let him stay up until 12, however he isn't to tell his mom because she would kill me since his bed time is 10.\n\nMy wife works from home and does most of her work at night while everyone is in bed because me and my son are \"loud and obnoxious\". At the time of the incident she is in her office, which is across the hall from my son's room, with the door locked while she is working. I was watching some Carnival Row and I said to myself \"self, now is an opportune time to stroodle the ole noodle. I pull out my phone and go to my incognito mode, ;) gotta be safe, and precede to search me out a suitable video. After a few minutes of searching I found some material and decided to go ahead and start it while I gathered the appropriate tools for the job. I press play and lay my phone on the bed and go grab some lotion and tissues. I jump back into bed placed my items beside of me and reached for my phone. That is when I realized it. I am panicking, FUCK FUCK FUCK, across my screen it has airplay and my son's T.V. was selected. 2 minutes has passed in the video and I thought ok maybe nothing has showed yet so I change it back to league and started to gather myself to go talk to him.\n\nThat is when I hear it. My wife is screaming to the top of her lungs and I hear my son pleading with her and I here him say something about dad (you little tattle tale). She is on a war-path now. uh oh. I start panicking \"oh shit oh shit oh shit\" it is like getting caught watching porn by your own mom. Then things go silent and I know she is coming for me I hastily throw the tissues and lotion under the bed and roll over and try to pretend I went to sleep. She kicks the door open, and I pressing my head through my pillow at this moment. She screams my name. My mind went blank and I made a snoring sound. That was probably the real fuck up. I heard her say, \"oh this bitch going to pretend to be asleep, ok ok.\" I decided I needed to answer her or I am a dead man. I rolled over and said ....yea? At this point I am waiting for her to make like a cartoon and turn into a steam whistle. She precedes to chew me a new one. To paraphrase something like \"here I am working then I hear people fucking across the hall and come to find out your streaming porn to his room, blah blah irresponsible, blah blah dumbass, blah blah sleeping on the couch\". She storms off and I heard her office door slam. I gather a blanket and my pillow and go to the couch, my son's door is shut and I don't want to press my luck as I walk by. I head to the couch and thought you know this needs to go to TIFU and here I am. Hopefully she doesn't smother me in my sleep lol.\n\nThanks for the silver and gold kind strangers, you honor me. WoW and platinum, thanks a lot. :D\n\nEdit/update 1: WoW, woke up and this post really blew up. Wife woke me up this mourning so we could talk about what happened lol. She wasn't upset by the porn, she was upset because she thought our son had porn blasting on his T.V. at 12 at night while he was suppose to be asleep and interrupting her work. Which escalated when she found out that I told him he could stay up until 12 and I, in fact, was the one who did the Porn streaming. Which escalated when she opened the door and I was pretending to be asleep. One thing I wanted to address is that she is by no means a bitch, she is an amazing and wonderful woman that just lost her cool. We have all been there at some point. We don't have an abusive relationship. She is the authoritarian in the house and I am a bit of a goofball, however we are fine with that as we rarely have a disagreement and compliment each other very well.\n\nUpdate 2: Talked to my son while taking him to school and he finds the situation hilarious and can't wait to tell his friends. When I told him I can't believe he threw me under the bus he told me I would do the same and he is right.\n\nUpdate 3: Sorry I have no intention of linking the \"sauce\" some mysteries are better left unsolved.\n\nTL:DR I was using Airplay to stream videos to my sons room while he was suppose to be sleeping, decided to spank it and accidentally streamed porn to my son's room while my wife was right across the hall from him.",

A bit later my parents made a huge deal about some 5 second titty scene in a movie and that moment on i was super intrigued about it and loved trying to find porn, aside from being a boy and naturally being curious, but now it was a mission to get porn after that huge ordeal, and basically being an extreme womanizer till 30ish, lucky i broke the cycle and have a healthy relationship.

From the looks of it, my sister had not touched the food, so it was all there, gathering immense amounts of mold and turning to mush.\n\nAfter throwing away 3 or 4 bags of unidentifiable fruits and vegetables, I came across the thermos. Why I didnt follow my gut instinct to throw this thing out is beyond me at this point, but I made an attempt to open it. I tried to unscrew the cap, with absolutely no success. Trying a little harder, again I went to unscrew it. At this point the bottle was taunting me, it had waged a war that it already knew it had won. I was pulling out every trick imaginable, running it under hot water, using a towel for better grip, tapping it against a hard surface, but the capsule remained vigilant.\n\nI finally admitted defeat and turned to get reinforcements, but this is the exact moment that it had been waiting for. After I got about 10 feet from the sink, I heard an explosion. A wave of pure nauseating, vile putridness hit my nose before I even heard the cap hit the floor! The microbes had been preparing for this moment for two years, and I unsuspectingly activated their trap card. My eyes were watering and I was futally attempting to suppress the gagging that ensued. I have smelt many awful things in my life, skunk, weed, rotting human feces, but none have left NEARLY as deep of a scar as what I have experienced today. The only way I can describe the smell is pure danger. My nose was screaming biohazard.\n\nI ran back to the sink to finish what I had started and dumped probably and inch or two of soap on the mac and cheese that was left rotting twice through the summer, fall, winter and spring in a pathetic attempt to mask the smell. I dumped the vile blob down the irrigator, praying that I would live. I could feel the life force draining from me as the smell continued to permeate my nose.\n\nI retreated from the house for a couple hours, begging that the smell had left, but the faint smell of rotten dairy still lurked in the house. I dont know how long exactly it took, but it eventually dissipated and I've been left only with the scar of my stupidity.\n\nTLDR: I opened a thermos filled with rotting mac and cheese, only to be assaulted by the worst smell I have ever experienced.\n\nEDIT: To those questioning my use of weed as a bad smell, it smells awful to me. I get that some people might really enjoy it, but to me you might as well hold a skunk up to my nose.\n\nEDIT 2: its come to my attention that there is a difference between the smell of buds and the smell of smoke. For clarification, when I say weed, I am referring to the smoke.",

He must have been a bit distraught because he left his food in a plastic container.\n\nOne of my coworkers pointed it out a few days later, telling me the food was starting to smell a little. When I touched the sealed container, a fly flew away (though it probably didn't come from inside). I didn't want to just throw it away as I thought the coworker might come back to claim it. But since there was a faint smell, and none of us had the courage  to open and clean it, we moved the container to our faraway, closed archive room.\n\nThis was 2 months ago and, after reading your post, I'm just gonna throw it away without a second thought.",

            "Lol! Great story! I have kind of a similar one\n\nWhen I was in high school I used a powdered espresso in a thermos, but didn\u2019t finish it and forgot to dump it out. End of the school year approaches and I have a free period so I go to gets head start and clean out my locker. Our school is cheap on AC so it\u2019s a humid 80 degrees in Michigan. I find said mug- open it, its curdled and smells overpoweringly rancid, plus the pressure forming inside results in a significant glop falling on the ground in front of my locker when I remove the lid. Who would\u2019ve thought powdered espresso would curdle and go that rancid in ~6 months?\n\nTrying to remedy- I go down the hall about 100 ft to try to rinse out the thermos in a drinking fountain thinking my mom would be cross if I just threw it away. The gross won\u2019t come out of the mug properly and the sludge isn\u2019t going down the drain. Just a giant chunk sitting in the fountain stinking up the area.\n\nI determine my efforts futile and dump the mug in a garbage 100 ft further down the hall. I should\u2019ve probably put the lid back on. I realize that the hallway now smells terrible but I\u2019m a shitty teenager and don\u2019t know to do anything about it (like find a janitor for help) so I leave the scene of the crime.\n\nFast forward to the bell when students are piling out of classrooms into this hallway- everyone is gagging because the whole hall smells TERRIBLE. Kids are complaining of illness and needing to go home, the school resource officer is called in to investigate a possible stink bomb, janitors are scouring for the source including sewer leaks...\n\nI never said a damn word. I still kinda feel bad.",

            "This reminds me of something that happened to me in elementary school. I was with my friend Simon, eating muffins during recess. Somehow a bit of water ended up in his ziploc container, wetting a barely munched carrot muffin.\n\nNow I was a very tranquil kid, but somehow, *somehow*, it occurred to me  that we could fill it with water and see what happens, as a kind of experiment. So we did just that, and after getting back inside, Simon put it at the back of his desk.\n\nWe completely forgot about it, and that was the end of it for a while. Fast forward 3 months later, its the end of school session and kids are emptying their desks. Thing is, Simon was a messy kid, his desk was notorious for being untidy as hell, and he ended up knocking the ziploc container open. RIP.\n\nThe ungodly smell came first, like the hot smell of acrid vomit. People were getting confused, thinking someone was sick, but nobody was, and it was so freaking strong that it wasn't really possible to pinpoint where it was coming from. In a flash of lucidity, I remembered the muffin, but I was way too scared to take any responsibility for it.\n\nIt began smelling so strong, teachers from other parts of the school came to see wtf was going on. At some point it basically filled half the school (open classrooms), and the principal made everyone (\\~300 people) evacuate the building. They thought a pipe might have burst of something.\n\nEventually they found out the source of the smell and Simon got lambasted (nothing serious, but still). I never thought something so small could smell so bad.",

If you haven't been to Texas, cars can basically become ovens. That milk became the most vile thing, and the smell *never* came out.

            "I lived in a mobile home (trailer) for the summer in a field in a quiet countryside place in the west of Ireland about 30 years ago. It had been there for so long if you tried to move it it would have fallen apart. Real hippy living. No electricity. No running water. Tap in the next field beside a cattle trough was the only water source. Bottle gas cooker, candles and a lantern for light at night. The previous occupant had cleared out most of his stuff but whatever bits and pieces he left behind were all stuffed into a tiny room at the back of the trailer and everything was stacked almost ceiling high and looked like it had been undisturbed for years. I never really bothered looking in that room until one hot summer afternoon I decided to clear it out as I wanted to use it for storage myself. Turns out it was crammed full of not just the previous occupant\u2019s stuff but junk from many other people who\u2019d lived there going back years. I had thrown out most of the junk and the pile was getting down to just above knee height when I noticed a large square plastic box. I thought it might have been a cooler box for food/drinks etc. or something of that nature. Boy was I wrong. \n\nTurns out it was a chemical toilet. A full to the brim chemical toilet! I doubt there were any chemicals in it but there was plenty of urine and faeces that had been sitting there untouched, brewing and fermenting for years until yours truly opened it. The most poisonous, noxious, disgusting cloud of human urine/faeces gas hit me in the face like a mushroom cloud from a nuclear bomb. I ran out into the field in mid projectile vomit and kept vomiting for about 45 minutes, eyes streaming, retching like I was about to vomit up every organ inside me. Easily the worst thing I have ever smelled. Turns my stomach even thinking about it. It took days and a lot of scrubbing and constant incense burning to get rid of the smell.",

I panicked and just threw the thermos back in my locker and speed walked to class, leaving the new birth on the floor. Half way through class I started smelling this strong putrid nose stinging smell. Everyone could smell it and were talking about it. I didn\u2019t think it was my thermos blob because I was three halls away. I was so wrong. They had to evacuate the whole school to the soccer field while they figured out what was going on.

            "Yesterday the guy I just moved in with did something similar. I've been here almost 3 weeks now. While cooking for us, I realized he had a number of expired items in his fridge and pantry, and since he will not even think about consuming a food item even 1 day past its expiration date, I took it upon myself to clean these items out. I found items that expired back in 2018! I rounded up the items and put them in a pile, to be taken out to the trash bin. \n\nAmong the items I put in the trash pile was a clear container with some murky brown, thick liquid. When he threw away the trash, he didn't throw away that container and instead put it in the sink, which I didn't realize until he asked me to wash the dishes while he fixed a curtain that fell. \n\nI began washing the dishes but knew I did not want to wash that container. I wanted it in the trash, asap. I told him so. He said okay but that in order to get rid of it, it needed to be cleaned first. I expressed my worries about the smell and that I wanted the container, thick liquid and all, in the bin. \n\nHis response was that he used to be a dishwasher and wasn't bothered by smells. I don't do well with rotting food smells so I still didn't want to open or wash the container. I told him this and he said he'd do it. He walked over to the sink, turned on the water, opened the container and began rinsing its contents out. \n\nI had moved away to avoid the smell because I like this guy and dont want him to see me puking if I can avoid it. It smells AWFUL and I tried not to gag. I told him I was taking a break and went to our bedroom and tried to get the smell out of my nose. I lit a candle and put on scented lotion, making sure I placed some near my nose. \n\nA few minutes go by and I decide to go see if he's done. As soon as I'm a few steps from the kitchen, the smell hits me again. He tells me he has no idea what was in that container or why it had bones in it. I stop in my tracks but he tells me to take over washing the rest of the dishes, which mind you, had been in the sink as he poured out the container's contents down the drain. I begin to protest but his response again, is that he used to be a dishwasher and you get used to it. \n\nIn the end, I opened the kitchen window and held my breath as best as I could as I washed the dishes. I did it because he's an essential worker and has been working his butt off. I knew he was exhausted. We finished up cleaning/fixing the curtain and each browsed our phones. He fell asleep minutes later but the smell permeated the air for hours. It's still not completely gone today. \n\nBut lesson learned. If there's ever something I want thrown out, I need to take it outside and put it in the bin myself.",

            "This reminds me of something similar I did a few years back. I was in college living in an apartment with roommates, and we were all coming back to the apartment after going away for 2 or 3 weeks during winter vacation between the Fall and Spring semesters.\n\nI was settling in when I noticed I left my mini rice cooker out on the kitchen countertop. Strange, I thought, I'm usually pretty good at putting my things away after I finished cleaning up. Guess I must've missed it when I was rushing out the day I left for home. So I went ahead and opened it up, as one naturally does, not thinking much of it.\n\n>I'm usually pretty good at putting things away after I finished cleaning up.\n\n>after I finished cleaning up.\n\nOh.\n\nOh no.\n\nNow I don't have quite the vernacular to describe what I saw and smelled in there quite as wonderfully as OP did, but suffice it to say that I regretted opening up that rice cooker.\n\nApparently I had made lunch or dinner the day I was leaving and in my rush to catch the bus, I had forgotten to toss out the leftover rice. Why past me would make more food than I know I could finish on the day I was leaving for weeks, I don't know. But I'm glad I at least had the sense to unplug it before I left so the apartment didn't catch on fire, or that the rice cooker didn't become a very warm incubator (more than it already was an incubator) for whatever abomination resided in there.\n\nI wasn't as brave as OP was. I couldn't face it. I was weak. But I wasn't willing to lose the rice cooker either. So I paid my roommate $20 to clean it out for me. He's still one of my closest friends to this day.",

I thought it had warped during years of use. \n\nNope. It had warped because of weeks of being milk sitting in the car during early June. I brought everything in the house and started my routine. Grab cup, open, separate pieces, rinse and dishwasher. \n\nI reached for the warped cup, and gave it a little squeeze as I reached for the lid and \"POP\" the top just popped off and it was damn near instant.

Some old newspapers and canned goods mostly but we also found a 20 year old paper carton of milk still sealed. I finished cleaning up the floor while he went to take the food items to the dumpster. Well he only made it an isle or 2 away before dropping the milk carton which split up the side. It was by far one of the worse things I have ever smelled and that smell quickly spread over 6 isles or so it was nasty.

            "Once as a teenager, I bought a carton of a dozen eggs to use for egging. It was hidden under the old recliner (clear of the folding mechanism) in my bedroom. Quite a while later, I noticed that my room started to have a faint kind of sour trashy smell. It wasn't a rotten egg smell, so my teen brain wasn't reminded of my stash of eggs. After over a couple of  weeks of a gradually intensifying stench, the odor was so bad that I wanted to sleep elsewhere in the house. My Mom told me to clean my room and find out what was the source of the smell. Once I looked under the recliner, I spotted the carton and immediately recalled buying them weeks or a month or two ago. I carefully opened the lid and 11 eggs looked perfectly normal. The twelfth egg had some dark blue-green fault lines at the pointy end and some staining in a lighter shade. Maybe it actually had a chick in it? I got them outside without any further mishap. \n\nThen there was the time a few years ago that some animal  got into the attic and fell into the wall between the drywall and the exterior wall of the house in my younger daughter's bedroom. We heard is scratching for a couple of days, then it got quiet. Then smelly. Kind of a rotten chicken acrid decomposition odor. Then we could smell it as soon as we climbed the stairs to the second floor after a few more days. After a few months,  the smell faded to a barely noticeable hint of a faint, acrid, rotten chicken smell. Surprisingly that was about the only thing my pre-teen daughter DIDN'T complain about that summer. A few years later, after a divorce, we sold the home and did not tell the new owner about it. There was no noticeable smell by that time.",

One day near the end of Summer, one of our crew that regularly worked the paddle wheel boat that we did lunches and dinners on came back in with our missing  Cambro. He was all pleased and laughing about it. I asked him where it had been and he replied that it had just gotten some stuff piled up on top of it and left on the dock. \n\nHe goes to open it up, but I quickly stop him and tell him that he has to take it outside. He argues a bit with me but I insist and he grudgingly takes it out to the loading area.\n\n\" Nope, further out\" I tell him, and he complains some more. I explain to him that it was his fault it got lost and that while I was glad he found it, he was gonna clean it and he was going to do so at the far end of the parking lot. He bitched some more, but eventually picked up the Cambro and walked towards the back corner. He went to stop a few more times, but I continued to wave him further on while I stayed on the dock. I finally gave him the thumbs up and he went to start his new project.\n\nNow, pretty much the entire staff had heard all this and followed us out to see what was going on. I even held a couple of guys back that had been going out to help him. \n\nThat Cambro had sat on the dock for at least a full month, if not two, in the middle of an exceptionally scorching Summer.

He was on the couch and I was on an air mattress struggling to get to sleep, as I'm laying there I see his silhouette in the darkness stand up, face the couch he is sleeping on and the pee all over his grandmother's couch, pull his pants up and lay back down on the same couch he peed on.

            "Sleepwalking is insanely weird. When I was 14 I was up late at night playing video games when I heard a knock on the door. I was like wtf? It's almost 1 am. I was going to get my dad but first I check through the peephole and I see is the girl next door. I had seen her a few times, her dad and my dad were friends so I didn't think much of it. \n\n\nI open the door and immediately I can tell something is very wrong. She's clearly out of it, messy bed hair, her eyes look weird, she's barefoot, wearing a thin sleeve less shirt and she's wearing no panties. I'm thinking \"holy crap WTF is going on?!\". I'm extremely confused and all I could say is \"yeah...hello?\". \"We are having people over and we need some extra chairs and plates\" she says in a very monotonous tone. I'm like, are you sure?. Then she starts explaining how it's just for tonight and she's pointing at her house and moving her hands around when one boob straight up popped out of her shirt. She finishes her bizarre explanation that I could barely pay attention to and just stands there, staring at me with creepy dead eyes, while she's almost naked with one huge boob out like it's nothing. This all happened in the span of 10 seconds and I still couldn't process what was happening. Do I just give her the stuff? Do I have to help her with the chairs? These chairs are heavy as hell, I'm going to have to do multiple trips with this crazy naked girl. I ended up telling her that no, she couldn't borrow our stuff and she just left without saying anything. \n\nWhat made the whole thing even more crazy was the fact that I didn't know sleepwalking was actually a real thing, let alone that they could say half coherent sentences.

            "Sounds like a story I heard about my parents while living with my mothers parents. My parents were working different shifts. Basically just trading off the car in the driveway. Well one day my mother comes home from work to hear from my grandmother what happened with my father. Grandparents are sleeping in bed when grandma gets the feeling like shes being watched. She wakes up and rolls over to find my father standing over her in nothing but his underwear. He then walks over to their closet and starts going through it. At this point my grandmother is freaking out and wakes up my grandfather. When my grandfather questioned my father on what he was doing, the response was \"I'm looking for my accountant\". At some point my grandparents realized my father was sleepwalking. After having no luck with the search for the elusive accountant, my father walked out of the room. My grandmother worried that he might wander outside or something has sent my grandfather to follow. Grandpa found my dad down the hallway. Taking a leak in the bathroom. With the door wide open. Afterwards, dad went right back to bed and had no memory of anything that happened. My mother was filled in when she returned from work.",

        "selftext": "So this happened yesterday, but still, close enough I say. \n\nSo I wake up on a fine Sunday morning and my lovely wife snuggles into me for a cuddle. We're comfortable enough with each other that farting is not really an issue so I let one rip.\n\nThis was quite possibly the best fart I've ever done. I swear the covers lifted a fraction from the sheer force.\n\nMy wife looks up with a mix of admiration and disgust at the stupid grin on my face and inspiration strikes. I quickly grab the blanket and pull it over her head. Brilliant! Or so I thought.\n\nActing far quicker than I ever thought possible she manages to kidney punch me, escape from the blankets, drag them up over my head and drop the dirtiest fart I've ever smelt right in my face.\n\nAs a little extra flavour, my wife is lactose intolerant, and also in denial about her lactose intolerance. The phrase 'a little bit won't hurt' is her life motto. Often followed by horrible bloating and gas.\n\nThe previous night she had eaten a bunch of pizza and chocolate. I couldn't breathe.\n\nTo add insult to injury she then called in my two little devilspawn daughters and told them to jump on me, causing me to gasp as two seperate impacts rocked me under the bed.\n\nNeedless to say I won't be trying that stunt again for a while.\n\nTl;dr: tried to Dutch oven my wife and she won.\n\nEdit: holy crap this blew up. Thanks for all the love guys. Yes, I know that my wife is amazing and I have no idea how she's put up with me for 8 years of marriage.\n\nEdit again: A lot of people have asked so I did a bit of research. Apparently the term comes from the 17th century when the British and the Dutch fought a bunch of wars and the British started coming up with slang and insults for the Dutch. That's where stuff like 'double Dutch' comes from too. It's derived from the Dutch oven crockpot that keeps all the smells and heat in.",

She just doesnt deserve that. Nothing against couples that are all about that and I know its probably not connected but I often ponder about relationships losing the spark and the mystery and become stale and then I think when both parties dont have the desire to shield their partner from their shit then yanoo these things add up. Id hate for my girlfriend to associate or look at me with disgust or repulsion and im not going to contribute to that. I guess its just the little things though. Gone two and a half years without puffing in front of my missus and vice versa. It's not too difficult. I just think once you've inhaled someone's gas something changes, maybe you become more connected and comfortable by feeling like you can just blow off all the time but I dont necessarily think that's what relationships need and I've never felt like I'm missing out. In fact in 11 years I've never puffed in front of a girl. It just isn't a thing to me. Some stuff you cant get around, shes gonna walk in after I've been sat on the pot. We live together. I still spray and gel the toilet though. Shes gonna walk into my music room when I'm in my own world and ive let off a couple and yanoo theres just nothing we can do about that.

I suddenly see her baby accidentally let go of his balloon so I instantly turn on my hero-mode and extend my hand to grab the balloon string. It was a really epic and glorious moment and in my mind I was already playing out how cool I looked and how the lady would thank me for saving the balloon. Unfortunately, I did not manage to grab it in time. I did however end up with my hand in a closed fist straight into another man's cheek who was walking next to me. Now there's a crying baby in front of me and a very shocked, confused and upset stranger beside me. I think after the initial shock he did realise I was only trying to do a good deed so he didn't say anything to me but either way I immediately slowed down in embarrassment  and let them walk ahead of me...I am the hero this city does not need.\n\nTL;DR Tried to save a baby's balloon from flying away but ended up punching a stranger in the face.",

I stopped the car and managed to get it to actually hop in on it's own. Luckily the collar had a phone number so I gave it a call and the lady who answered sounding like she was crying because she was so happy I found their family pet. I was less than a mile from where they lived so I went ahead and followed her instructions to her house. Standing out front was the lady with tears streaming down her face and like 3-4 little kids jumping and clapping for joy. I felt like a big god damn hero getting out of the car carrying the dog as the kids cheered and the lady blubbered her thanks through tears of joy.\n\nI was late to work but spent the entire day on cloud 9.\n    \nThe next day, when driving to work, I came across the same fucking dog in the same part of the road he was on the day before. Kept driving. I saw that dog wandering around on and off for the next month or two so apparently people kept returning it and the stupid lady would just put it right back in the backyard where there was clearly an easy way to escape. \n  \nI'm convinced that lady put on the same show each time too.",

She\u2019s been undergoing chemotherapy and as a result has lost all of her hair. Yesterday my wife was with her and one other friend. They decided that they\u2019d shave off all their hair to support their friend and cheer her up. And they did. It\u2019s a great gesture and all, but I wasn\u2019t aware of this. \n\nI was working on my laptop on the bed when my wife comes up and asks me if I find bald women attractive. I wasn\u2019t looking at her and hadn\u2019t seen that *she* was bald, so I say, \u2018Nope. Not my type. Not attracted at all. Why?\u2019 Then I look up and, lo and behold, my wife was bald. Not a single hair on her head. I was so shocked my face could\u2019ve probably become a viral meme. \n\nShe says that I don\u2019t find her attractive now and starts crying. I try to salvage the situation by telling her that I don\u2019t find *other* bald women attractive, but she looked hot without hair. She told me I was lying. I tell her that it\u2019s just hair and will grow back. This was apparently not a good thing to say as she started crying again. \n\nMy mom, who\u2019s been living with us, told me I\u2019m an ass for making her cry. Wife slept in a different room. She\u2019s been also looking in the mirror quite often. I\u2019ve tried telling her that I don\u2019t care about the hair and she did a great thing supporting her friend but she says that I\u2019ve given her a small insecurity issue for the time being. \n\nTL;DR wife asks me if I find bald women attractive, I say no without looking. When I look up, wife was bald.\n\nEdit : Wow this blew up. Since some of y\u2019all are asking, she\u2019s not generally this emotional. Just that her friend probably won\u2019t survive the cancer and has limited time. That\u2019s been messing up with her state of mind lately.\n\nEdit 2: Everyone wants me to shave my head. Not happening. Nope. I quite like my head full of hair. What if it never grows back lmao?",

            "As someone who has survived cancer I wouldn\u2019t ever want my friends to shave their hair just for support (charity fund raising is different). Nice gesture aside, she seems to not have been 100% in on the hair shaving and perhaps needed your validation after regret sunk in. \n\nThat stuff doesn\u2019t really matter now though. Time to be supportive and maybe make some big gesture yourself to let her know you are attracted to and love her regardless of looks. Wounds heal, hair regrows, but emotional scars will remain forever if not tended. Good luck",

Why do you ask?\n\nHer:  Well, I made my mom\u2019s famous meatloaf recipe.\n\nYou:  Really?  That\u2019s exactly what I wanted!  You\u2019re the best!\n\nHer:  I know.  Smash later?\n\nBut if you\u2019d said \u201cFried Chicken\u201d, the meatloaf would have gone in the trash and you\u2019d be making yourself a ham sandwich and taking care of that other thing on your own for the rest of the week.",

The last thing a spouse would want to be worrying about when going through chemo was the one time you said that you didn\u2019t like bald women. \u201cI mean, some women could pull it off. I can\u2019t think of anyone specifically though.\u201d I know you said it was a friend, but I\u2019m just giving advice that I use.",

            "I know I will get downvotes for this, but women are super conditioned to attach their own self worth and value directly to their appearance. A man can be funny, smart, kind, etc and still be ugly and still be considered of worth. A woman's main commodity, according to most of our society, is our appearance. Before anyone gets up in arms about that statement, just think back to any reddit post where the woman is not conventionally attractive and you will find just as many comments on her appearance as you would the actual content of the video. \n\nSo I assume what happened was that she made a snap decision out of kindness, compassion, and affection for her friend and then later realized that while all those traits of hers are amazing, we still *have* to feel attractive or else we don't feel worthy. \n\nShe did kinda trap you into giving an honest answer, which sucks. But it was honest, and there's nothing you should say or do to take it back. But what you should do is commend her on being such a supportive friend and remind her that there are many many things beyond her basic appearance that makes you love her. \n\nIt sucks, but when it comes to women and feeling unattractive, it is a complicated and slippery slope.",
            "I don't think it's an asshole move or anything you did was messed up. Though I do understand her reaction. You should try and clarify that it ain't a big deal to you. It's awesome that she's supporting her friend. And on her end, I think she'll need to come to terms with that fact that you have preferences and this isn't some huge deal to you.",
            "Once she\u2019s calmed down, tell her yes, you don\u2019t find bald women attractive, but she\u2019s not just a bald woman, she\u2019s your wife and you\u2019d find her attractive no matter what. And then buy her flowers and take her out for a nice meal (or takeout if you\u2019re in America and can\u2019t go out to eat)",

You say you are attracted to her and you love her because you know that if she\u2019ll go to this length to support a friend in a bad a spot, you know she\u2019ll do anything for you. And then here is the kicker\u2014you tell her that you\u2019d do the same for her. And if you do it right, you\u2019ll probably be just fine.",

Maybe she\u2019s thinking if she had cancer and that happened to her a little longer term, you wouldn\u2019t find her attractive/support her. Who knows - we can all twist things in our mind. \n\nWhen she\u2019s calmer, maybe you can talk about how she feels about the bald head and reassure her that you find her attractive. Time to reconnect a bit.",
            "Not your fault. \n\nIf your opinion mattered that much, why didn't she say something before? Or maybe she didn't say anything in case your opinion changed her mind.\n\nShaving your head isn't easy for some people. But, she did it to support her friend who doesn't have a choice. A kind heart is attractive. \n\nMaybe it isn't your favorite haircut. But, that doesn't change her as a person. I think she just needs to hear that you know that. \n\nBut, if you can't bear to look at her, that would make you an AH because you can't see beyond hair.",

AITA?\n\nWhat she did was really nice, and I understand that she might feel bad, I'm just saying.",
            "You definitely are not the asshole here. If baldness was an attractive feature on most women, their friends wouldn\u2019t shave their heads to make her feel better. \n\nYour wife decided to be a little less attractive, in solidarity with her friend, which is a great gesture. But crying over it means that maybe she wasn\u2019t ready for it?",
            "Bit of an overreaction. Not at all like you were saying she wasn't attractive anymore, you just prefer hair, which is pretty damn normal. And you think she looks better with hair. Everyone whether they'd admit it or not. Has preferences on their SO, it's how atractiveness works. But it's not black and white, maybe you prefer long curly hair and your SO cuts it and straightens it. You're still going to find them attractive. Or at least you would if you aren't shallow and thoroughly love them.",

Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.\n\nYou can redeem yourself by saying \u201cit\u2019s not my preference, but it\u2019s particularly noble that you shaved your head to support your friend and I\u2019m proud of you\u201d but I don\u2019t feel like you need to apologise for your initial answer.",
            "Possibly controversial opinion: Your wife should have told you first that she was planning on shaving her head.\n\nYes I know it's her body her choice yada yada yada. I'm sure his wife wouldn't appreciate it if he got a big henna tattoo on his face.",
            "Just tell her that you've never found her attractive in the first place. That should take her mind off her baldness.",

I read a lot of situations were partner do this menacingly to emotionally manipulate their SO. I guess there are whole twitter accounts that goes like \u201eif your partner doesn\u2019t accepts you changing something extreme about yourself he/she doesn\u2019t really love you\u201c which is not how love and relationship works. She put you on the spot and should have seen this coming.  At least she is doing it for a reasonable cause and not just to fuck with you, but she could have handled that a lot better.",

I try to salvage the situation by telling her that I don\u2019t find *other* bald women attractive, but she looked hot without hair. She told me I was lying. \n\nBe honest OP, you were lying. And there's nothing wrong with not liking bald women, your wife is obviously stressed out but lying never helps IMO. I agree with the others that shaving your head will be a nice sign of solidarity and support, but only if you actually want to, you shouldn't feel obliged to do so in any way, and no one should make you feel bad since you did absolutely nothing wrong.",

            "The only reason people shave their heads in support of someone is *because* it's not generally seen as attractive. If it was something fashionable then you'd just be doing something nice for yourself.\nThe person shaving their head is making a statement by shaving it despite it being unattractive, because they want to send the message that supporting their friend is more important to them than their appearance. \n\nSeems like your wife did not understand what she was getting herself into and was peer pressured into doing it, while not understanding the motivation.",

            "Going to state an unpopular opinion. Doing a safer and less involved form of wailing and rending your clothing is generally nonsense. It\u2019s often done to attract attention to the person doing it and lets them become part of what\u2019s going on. \n\nWhen my grandmother lost her hair during chemotherapy my cousin made a big scene of being shaven, done, of course, on social media. I\u2019m sure she enjoyed all the attention from well wishers and those pitying the difficult time she was going through. Why, she\u2019d do anything to make her grandmother\u2019s struggle a little better. \n\nExcept, of course, actually going to see her or to do the things around my grand parent\u2019s home they needed done. Cleaning the bathroom or washing clothes won\u2019t get those likes, after all.  \n\nJesus was very clear about charity and good deeds. \n\nTake heed that you do not do your charitable deeds before men, to be seen by them. Otherwise you have no reward from your Father in heaven. Therefore, when you do a charitable deed, do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory from men. Assuredly, I say to you, they have their reward. But when you do a charitable deed, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, that your charitable deed may be in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will Himself reward you openly.",

            "If your opinion means so much to her emotional well-being, maybe she should have asked you before she decided to shave it off? Or maybe she could have shown you her new look and then asked if you liked it?\n\nInstead, she walked right into it by asking your honest opinion, which you rightly gave, and now somehow YOU are in trouble. \n\nAll you said was the truth, and you\u2019d have had no way to know that speaking that truth would have hurt her feelings. You are 100% in the right here and did nothing wrong. Your wife needs to learn not to set people up like this, and needs to deal with her hurt feelings and put on her big girl pants. Punishing you for just being honest in the moment is very immature.",
            "If only Admiral Ackbar was around; he definitely would have informed you that it was a trap",
            "For the record you are not the asshole. Your mom kind of is though.",
            "I almost feel like this was a trap. She knew what she was doing. Why didnt she ask if he would like HER if she was bald instead of asking if he likes WOMEN if they were bald? The typical answer to that would be no, from any man. But if she would have specified her question, the answer would have been different. Like one commenter said, she was having regrets and was looking for validation. She might be mad at herself and is just looking for someone to blame. The husband was an easy target. Just my opinion.",
            "Sorry but i think shaving your own hair for support grown adults isn't something that people should do, I understand if it's your kid or little sister for sure but otherwise I'm not for it.\nAnd yeah I agree that bald women don't look good,  she probably regrets it herself too. It's not just cause of your reaction, you did what you could.",
            "Lesson for her: Don't as a question you don't want the answer to.",
            "Idk. Was she sure you'd like her that way? If yes, why ask? If no, why NOT ask before? Was she sure she'd be okay with you finding her unattractive for a few months for a pretty damn good reason? If yes, why ask? If no, why NOT wonder before?\n\nThere are so many layers of why what she did makes no sense.",
            "i mean if your wife did it for her friend she shouldn\u2019t be concerned about what you think now. she did it anyway. tell her to get over it lol she didn\u2019t do it to look sexy so why bother being sad now.",
            "NTA. You didn't know she shaved her head.",
            "Correction: today your wife fucked up by being peer pressured into shaving her head to \u201csupport\u201d a friend (which, ok, adults doing it for children is good, adults for adults is a bad friend or someone not knowing how to actually support others) when she really didn\u2019t want to and was hoping that she could find some light in the tunnel and blind sided you with a drastic change",
            "The only thing left to do now is say that you never liked her hair anyway.",
            "NTA! lol\n\n&#x200B;\n\nlook you fucked up, but in a totally understandable way.  People are emotional, you hurt her feelings, you apologized.... life moves on.  She'll get over it.",

            "I am a two time cancer survivor and I would never have anyone shave their head for me. I personally don\u2019t understand how that would make me feel better. \u201cCool we\u2019re all bald and I\u2019m still the only one with stage four cancer.\u201d I am also not the type of \u201cmisery loves company\u201d person. You shouldn\u2019t feel too bad. It sounds like she is being overly dramatic by sleeping in a different room. Life is too short to be that upset about this and she isn\u2019t the one who has the cancer. Her hair will be down to at least her shoulders in four years. I think a big gesture to show how much you love her should do the trick. At the end of the day when you said your vows you meant it and you will love her no matter what. Oooh maybe a vow renewal. No better way to say I love you no matter what than getting remarried.",
            "Most women don't shave their heads bald, i agree with ya, its not a good look.   But the reason she did it was great and she should be commended for it.  That doesn't mean you instantly like bald chick's because of her choice.  You were honest but also respected what she did, she's having regrets doing it and probably why she reacted that way",
            "why the fuck do people do something, ask somebody their opinion, then get angry from the answer. dont ask if u dont like",
            "Your wife set you up with a shitty question.",
            "What the fuck kind of stupid question is that even? The percentage of men that find bald women attractive has to be incredibly small. Why would a woman shave her head completely bald and then assume her significant other would find that attractive?\n\nHell, I'd be willing to bet a majority of women don't find bald guys attractive (or at least not as attractive as guys with hair) and being bald is a common thing in men...",
            "You have a silly wife",
            "Pff. Her fault. She asked but couldn't handle the truth.\n\nNow I wait for the down votes.\n\nOh, and the way you tried to salvage everything? I would probably do the same...",
            "Wife is being an idiot.  She didn\u2019t shave her head in order to look hot.  She did it as a gesture of solidarity with someone who also doesn\u2019t think it looks hot, who hates the fact that her own hair is falling out from chemo because she doesn\u2019t feel hot without her hair.  If it looked hot, people would be doing it all the damn time as a fashion exercise, bald women would be so common on the streets that nobody would take the slightest notice except for the ones complimenting her on what a hottie she is with \u201cthe naked look\u201d \u2014 all of which would render the gesture of support completely meaningless.\n\nShe needs to make up her mind, if she can find where she left it.",
            "I\u2019d ask if your wife is now single...\n\nBut I\u2019m not attracted to bald women either.",
            "Well you can try telling her that you thought she was asking if you have a bald fetish or something like that, and that she'll always be the love of your life, even without her hair, or those teeth.",
            "I mean if she shaved her head assuming she\u2019d still feel sexy she missed the point like entirely.",

        "selftext": "Just happened 15 minutes ago.\n\nSo this evening was much like any other (well, any other quarantine evening). I wrapped work at home, my girlfriend & I walked the dog around the park, and then went back to the apartment to relax before dinner. We were missing a few key dinner items (beer) so I ran to the store to pick them up. When I got back home and walked through the door, my girlfriend (who is the best) had dressed up in full sexy teacher regalia (see) - skirt, glasses and all. Fuck. Yes.\n\nAs things were just about to get started, my phone rang. I wasn't about to interrupt what was going down so I naturally ignored the call. Ah, but then the text tone. And then my girlfriend's text tone. We checked and it turned out it was a good friend dropping off food gifts but couldn't get into the apartment building. I hated to pause but it was super sweet of her so, as the one not in costume, I ran down. My flaw here (and don't judge me guys) is that me and this friend started to catch up a little bit and suddenly 20 minutes had gone by. Damnit. I hurried myself back to the apartment but when I walked in she was no longer on the couch - she was dicing jalapenos, finishing making guacamole in the kitchen, still in costume. I loved it, don't get me wrong, but also had other intentions. I think the more astute of you might know where this is going...\n\nWe wound up getting hot and heavy in the kitchen and moved to the bedroom. We started with hand play, she went down on me, then I went down on her. All was right with the world. And then I started to feel an uncomfortable tingle on my nethers, a strengthening tingle, god-like, especially on my huevos. And all of a sudden I'm on fire.\n\nI didn't want to kill the mood. I really didn't. I tried to power through for another 30 seconds, but eventually it occurred to me that a.) this wasn't going away and b.) when we did get to where we were going, she was going to catch the pain too. I paused and looked up:\n\n\"Babe...did you wash your hands after you cut up those jalapenos?\" \"Yeah...why?..oh...\" \"Babe, I...\" and suddenly I just started laughing as the heat continued to grow. \"I gotta go!\"\n\nI ran straight to the bathroom and started to wash things off. She ran in after me, apologizing the whole way. As I stood balls-to-sink, she rummaged through her bathroom cabinet looking for remedies.\n\n\"Aloe, aloe\" \"I know, I know\"\n\nFinally she pulled out an old bottle with \"ALOE\" in giant letters across it. Sweet baby Jesus, yes. I palmed up and slapped it on. As I waited for relief to wash over, I felt something else entirely. An even stronger burn. We look at the bottle and notice the subtext under \"ALOE\"...it says \"with lidocaine\". Between the jalapeno and the lidocaine, my balls were somewhere between the 4th of July and the Chinese New Year.\n\nAfter much rinsing, laughter, and a few tears, I am now on the couch with an ice pack on my balls watching Netflix. I feel mostly back to normal but it has been quite the ride. In another hour or so, I might even be fully functional again. Who knows?\n\nHappy Thursday everyone!\n\ntl;dr - girlfriend cooked in a kink, brought my balls to the brink, and I wound up washing twice in the bathroom sink.\n\n\n\nUPDATE - Well this has been a fun surprise! Many thanks to all for the comments and involvement. We read many of them in morning before work, laughing our asses off the whole time. A few updates. 1.) I am completely back to normal after my brush with the fires of the underworld 2.) I am now much more educated on what lidocaine is thanks to you trusty folks! I checked the back of the bottle and I now highly suspect it was the spearmint leaf oil that doubled my fun. 3.)  We have decided that in the future we will place a ceremonial bowl of milk next to the bed on Mexican food nights for pre- and post- dips, just to be safe. Thanks everyone and happy Friday!",
