In fact, business is the absolute worst.\u201d\n\nNobody else is at fault here but myself of course, and at this point I can\u2019t help but laugh. I could\u2019ve changed my major at some point, I certainly had to enough time to do so during the 5 FUCKING YEARS IT TOOK ME TO GRADUATE, but instead my dumbass just hoped that business would end up growing on me. It did not. \n\nI always loved the arts but I couldn\u2019t stomach the idea of pursuing a degree that seems to offer such serious job insecurity. Instead I chose the safe route, and now that\u2019s even harder to stomach. Hah oh dear...\n\nI made my bed time to sleep in it I guess lol whoops.\n\nTLDR: I chose safety instead of fulfillment and now I have a degree that I don\u2019t give a gosh darn fuck about.

            "The degree is what matters to most employers. You can use that business degree in the arts though easily. Run the business side of a gallery or a music bar or a theatre. You accomplished the degree most employers look for dedication at a task. The specifics of that task IE business over liberal arts or whatever is secondary. Find a unique way to use your skill set to your advantage and follow your dream young Jedi.",
            "You know what? It\u2019s way more important these days to just HAVE your degree. ~congrats btw~\nThe principal of the school I work at makes bank and has a degree in world politics, not education. A professor I know who teaches mathematics has their degree in psychology. I have a friend with an environmental science degree who makes a buttload every year organizing events for a large company.\n\nBe super proud- YOU DID IT. You got your degree. Celebrate, don\u2019t think that you did anything wasteful. This is your life and a huge accomplishment!!",
            "Sounds about right. My degree is in history, I work in tech and I would rather work with animals. Cannot do that now.\n\nFucked myself 3 fold.",
            "I\u2019ve gotta say it really doesn\u2019t matter all that much - most of my coworkers have degrees in completely unrelated fields.\n\nBusiness is also a broad enough field that you can take that baseline knowledge from your degree pretty much anywhere. I would say don\u2019t stress about it too much, just because you have a degree in a field doesn\u2019t mean you have to stay in that field! To look at it another way, a degree in business *does* offer a bit more stability than the uncertainty of an arts degree, you even said so yourself. So you have a safe fallback if other things don\u2019t work out.\n\nFollow your passion, man! Being an adult is awesome because you get to shape your own life path, and you don\u2019t have to let your schooling dictate how you want to make your living :)",
            "Well on the flip side... I pursued the degree of my dreams only to realize I would be broke for the rest of my life. \n\nEventually got into analytics, went back to grad school after i\u2019d maxed out the options from Google University...and now at 40 i\u2019m finally on track with a decent career and a shot at early retirement. \n\nTwo of the biggest lies told to young people are that :\n- you should follow your passion and be poor\n\nOR\n- screw your dreams, you should only value education for its earning potential\n\nThis is a false dichotomy. There\u2019s nothing wrong with having a job you don\u2019t love passionately, but that keeps you engaged enough to comfortably pay your bills without too much existential misery. \n\nAlso, it can really suck the fun out of your passion, when you depend on it for subsistence. \n\nThere\u2019s always a middle ground. Nothing wrong with building a side gig (business backgrounds are useful, trust me) and laying the ground for financial independence while working your 9-5. \n\nEnjoy your creative pursuits in your free time. Leverage your business degree to get a job you don\u2019t hate, and save money so you can retire early. Enjoy not being broke for the next 40 yrs. Heck, you could even go back to grad school eventually and study something you truly love. \n\nWhy not have your cake and eat it too? I\u2019m enjoying the prospect of paying my dues to the corporate overlords while I plot my escape in the next 5-10yrs. I wish i had gotten started earlier with a more practical major. \n\nA good education is the door to a good income. Learn to invest your money and you can quit the rat race while you still have life in you. \n\nBest of luck, you have a good life ahead of you.",
            "Relax, man.. your degree doesn't define your career. There are a ton of creative jobs out there that a business degree would be helpful in. Especially stuff like project management. Tons of movies, games, etc.. get designed by huge teams and there are a lot of jobs in those companies that need some amount of knowledge in a technical field. Your degree qualifies you for a lot of jobs that you might really want to do.\n\nThe idea that someone who likes the arts needs to abandon career opportunities and live in poverty is outdated and silly. Nearly every single thing you own or use required someone creative to design it. Clothes, furniture, technology, software, even stuff like advertisements and product labels. Depending on the company you end up working for you might find a job you are really passionate about. Good luck.",
            "Business is super broad yo, you can take that and go into a lot of areas. Running the business side of an art studio or arts festival? Help run a theatre or pottery shop? I know so many artists that are dumb with money and businesses (not thinking they should charge much for thier beautiful creations). And of course these arent going to be the top earners for fat stacks of cash, but i know a lot of small shops could add up if you were a consultant. And finding something you truly love will allow you to use the book learnings you have to help others. \n\nNot that you couldnt pursue artistic endevours yourself, but there a huge market around funding and sustaining the arts.",
            "What jobs would you like?  Apply and see what happens.",
            "I hope it's not too late to tell you this, but as somebody who did major in arts and has known a lot of artists in various mediums, I can tell you for an absolute fact that just as many of the people who ultimately make a living as an artist didn't major in any art at college as did.  Your business degree won't hold you back in any meaningful way.  You can sleep in the bed for now, but it doesn't prevent you from making a completely different new bed to sleep in.  Your college experience is not sufficient data with which to make any accurate prediction about your future career path.",

Life is more than your education, but your education will really help you in the rest of your life.  \n\nDo what you feel like and enjoy life and don't worry.",
            "I am struggling to not insult this post\n\nEvery single company people work for is a business. If you are self employed that is a business. No matter what job you are doing business will always be a factor. \n\nWhile you didn't get a more targeted degree, which could easily work for or against you, you have a degree that opens doors and makes you a suitable hire for a vast range of jobs and careers. \n\nYou are young and could have done much worse. Figuring out what you want to do in life doesn't stop with college. \n\nRead the book \"Be So Good They Can't Ignore You\" or read a summary of it. Two take aways.. Best not to follow your passion. You only start loving what you do when you become an expert.",

            "Same line as everyone else, but also if you don\u2019t want to do business at all, even in a cool field, that\u2019s a good degree to fall back on as a safety net.

            "I have a degree in the arts (visual communication, a.k.a. graphic design... I love art!) but worked in the field professionally for a year or so and hated it. Clients are terrible because they always know what they want (sarcastic there), projects require zero passion and are rarely ever creative, deadlines are tight and you feel like you're just a machine cranking out cliches 98% of the time. Long days and nights thinking about and working to meet deadlines for ungrateful companies, etc.\n\nI entered education and went back to school at the same time. It was tough at the time, but I see that it's the best decision ever. Been teaching for the past 11 years, maybe a little longer. I'm utilizing my skills as a graphic artist constantly, I get to decorate my classroom and create posters etc. My audience is just different, but I feel so much more fulfilled in every way. I also discovered that one thing I like about graphic design is the problem solving aspect of it. I'm constantly challenged in this way.",

Congratulations!!!\n\nNow I know it sucks to have a degree in a field that you have no interest in, it feels like you wasted 5 yrs and 73,000.00, but that degree will open more doors for you than not having one.  Plus your degree is universal.  Business and finance are in EVERYTHING including the arts.  You have the ability to find a way to get into the arts but in a different capacity than you originally would have liked.\n\nYour degree gives you the ability to make a living while you find your passion.

            "Hey, look, you did NOT f**k up, and I'll tell you why. A few years ago i did an interview project where I interviewed archaeologists about how they became archaeologists. This included archaeologists in academic and non academic jobs. To a person, the ones in non academic jobs told me they wished they knew something about business because that's what as lot of non academic archaeology actually is. You really have to know about business to be able to stay alive in compliance archaeology. AND i am currently working as an archaeologist in public service. I'm working with academic archaeologists on various projects. The fact that they do not know anything about business and how a business or finances or contacts work has been highly detrimental to their ability to work with us. To add to that, my skills as an archaeologist are not what got me hired on my present job, it was my experience with the legal process of working with agencies to do archaeological work.\n\nMy point is that you can take that degree and do SO MUCH with it, and probably more competently than a lot of other people. Pursue your interests and your dreams building on this wonderful foundation you have set for yourself.",

I know others have done this as well. \n\nMilk that degree to fund your dreams! And business is a fantastic thing to know about as you pursue the arts. \n\nBest of luck!",

            "Hey man, don't be too hard on yourself. Many people study one thing in school but end up doing something else afterwards. I used to work for someone who studied dance but ended up working in Finance because she wanted a more lucrative career. The important thing is that you are aware of this right now and take action to pursue what you're really interested in. It's going to take time and there will be times when you feel like taking the safe route but you just gotta keep pushing through. A degree nowadays don't mean anything other than the fact that you're \"somewhat more educated than someone without it\". It's like an entry ticket should you pursue a corporate or office-related job. \n\nAlso you never know when that degree may come in handy down the line. You say you're interested in the arts and couldn't care less about business but down the line, who knows if you decide to take a more business approach to your interests in arts. For example, I know someone who was a bassist in a rock and roll band who had zero business intellect but eventually after his time in music, he decided to open his own label. He's now a successful entrepreneur. You can't dread and regret the major and degree that you've obtained because there's no way to rewind the clock. You'll soon realize that many of your peers and seniors have degrees that they never used but are incredibly successful in the path they took.",
            "^(well 2 thoughts here: you can do a job you're not interested in for money, that doesn't exclude you from pursuing your interests in your free time. it likely will pay well enough that you have the luxury of enjoying your time off without worrying about money. secondly, you don't need an arts degree to pursue art. go get yourself an art studio in your house and enjoy.)",

You have a degree, and now you can start to make plans to build toward what you want to do. \n\nFor instance, you mention in a comment that you want to write. This is the time to start pursuing that:\n\n* Set aside time to read and write every day\n* Join a book club or writer's group, or otherwise find a community\n* If you're interested in writing professionally (technical writing, for instance), look into the field, start to learn common tools, and build up a portfolio\n* Find ways to pursue what you love at your current work\n\nIf you interview five people about how they found their career path, you'll have at least one (and likely more) who started out in a completely different place: studying neurobiology only to eventually become an English professor; starting out in IT and ending up in curricular design; starting out in construction and becoming a trader. The leaps may not always be intuitive, but they would not have gotten to where they are without those previous experiences. So you're not behind; you're on your own track.",

            "Art major here! 3 years and a pretty much useless bachelors with honors later, I can safely say, don\u2019t worry dude. Art is so closely linked with business nowadays that you can use your business degree to further any artistic endeavours. I had a business class come in to the gallery I worked at cause they wanted to know how to make art profitable. So, you know, it\u2019s happening. Obviously art shouldn\u2019t be used as a product like that, but if you want to make a living off of it and can find a niche that works for you, your degree can be very very useful. Lastly, art degrees are useless because they teach you all the things you can learn online. I cannot tell you how boring it is to be either fitted to the mold the school wants you to fit in or just lose all hope in art altogether because they tried. Whatever art you\u2019re into, the best way to learn is by doing. Even Michelangelo learned his techniques by copying those that came before him. So, long story short, your degree is still more useful, even if you don\u2019t want it. Entrepreneuship is the connecting piece between business and a successful career in art.",
            "Counterpoint: I was passionate about the arts, defied my family's wishes by going to art school, and now lack the time and energy to do much artsy stuff because I have to slave away like a rented mule doing non-artsy things to keep a roof overhead. Meanwhile, a friend who majored in something profitable just got her first novel published. Hope that makes you feel better.",
            "If it makes you feel any better, I have a degree in Fine Arts that I never really used, and now could really use more knowledge about general \"business.\"  But still, as others have said, just having a degree has made a pretty big difference.

I started PMing in advertising, now I work with one IT team, our R&D guy who\u2019s also a solutions architect, and I\u2019m also the PM who works as the bridge with our marketing team to help meet their tech needs, so I still get to be involved in the design process.

Too many people are graduating with a degree in their hobbies and passions rather than in something that pays the bills. This is a big proponent as to why we have a student debt crisis in America. The lucky ones are passionate in something that happens to be lucrative, but it\u2019s not true for the majority. I\u2019ve spoken to many successful people in previous generations and they sacrificed career paths in their hobbies for one that puts food on the table. I believe it\u2019s a part of growing up and making mature decisions. Keep your passion in the arts, but keep it as a hobby. Chances are, you\u2019ll like that passion way more as a hobby than a job anyways.",

Nothing insane like computer science or stats or accounting, but a decent field with decent career opportunities. \n\nNowadays I am literally trapped at a job I largely hate because the field is so impacted as so many people want to be biologists. I've been applying for years and can't even get entry level positions anymore because there are people with MS or PhDs going for those just to get their foot in the door.

After 5 years wanted to move up and got the job because he had a finance degree (even though he had not used his degree for 15 years). Almost 40 years remove from a degree he hated he is Senior Vice President of one of the largest hospital groups because he was a plumber with a finance degree ... that he hated.",
            "This is the problem with our society.\nYour career doesn\u2019t have to fulfill you. Just get a good job with a good paycheck so you can have time with your family or have enough money/time to do whatever does fulfill you on the weekends. My mom hates being an accountant but she has 3 wonderful kids (not biased lol) and is happy with the rest of her life and is excited to retire. Sure she loves art and is talented, but she finds time for her artistic stuff and has incorporated it into her life a lot. \nI\u2019d rather give my future kids a good life and be able to retire at a good age with my SO than be fulfilled by my job.

            "To set the context: I\u2019m a teen that wants to produce electronic music, and I live in India. \n\nHere in India, there are two jobs that are pushed extremely heavily, and which education seems to revolve around: engineering and medical. All coaching centres and schools boast about their students having the highest scores in JEE and NEET, which are the two premier exams in the education system, which secure you seats in Engineering and Medical colleges respectively. But the thing is, it\u2019s an ENDLESS Sinkhole. So many students go into these two fields only because 1. It pays the most and 2. These are the two most \u201chyped\u201d fields. But I know people who have studied for hundreds of hours and poured years of their lives into sitting in their rooms looking at the same book and solving the same problems over and over in the hope that they can become the best and score well in these exams, but still can\u2019t achieve the standards set for themselves. Maybe I\u2019m immatured or disillusioned or something, but I hear stories everyday from adults around me about the sheer number of engineering students who have gone to become janitors and fast food workers because they couldn\u2019t attend prestigious colleges or because there are no actual engineering jobs for them. (Just saying, this isn\u2019t meant to discredit who are passionate about engineering and medical professions, power to you guys)\n\nFrom the start, I never wanted to go down this path, but it seemed like the only way. I didn\u2019t know any other way because no one told me that there was another way other that attending NEET and JEE. But by some kind of blessing or miracle, I found out about a business PU and college that contacted my parents and offered me a seat there. Now I\u2019m going to attend a business college, and I\u2019m happy because it will 1. Enable me to get a job out of college so that I can focus on music on the side, 2. Give me a fallback in case music doesn\u2019t work out for me, and 3. Teach me stuff like business, media and digital marketing to help me gain a following as a producer one day. \n\nI could take an arts degree but the thing is: unless I go to an institution specifically for music or arts in general, taking a regular arts degree isn\u2019t worth in at all. Also after hours of research, so many people say that learning music production on my own is far easier because the biggest thing you can get out of music college is connections, which are already obtainable due to social media and collaboration. \n\nSo yeah, sorry for the long rant, but I just wanted to say: I seem to be going down a similar path as you have, but learning music while supporting myself with a good job seems like the most optimal way here. \n\nAgain, sorry for the long rant lol",
            "Hello alternate reality version of me!\n\nI graduated with an arts degree in 5 years because I couldn\u2019t stomach getting a safer, business-related degree that would look good in various industries. \n\nKinda annoyed by the art now. Still miserable.",

        "selftext": "This just happened.\n\nTo begin, I recently graduated from college and my lease ended. I planned on moving in with my girlfriend, but due to COVID she moved out of her place and into her mom's. Therefore, I have temporarily moved into her mom's as well until I find a job.\n\nSo last night we finished unpacking and after her family fell asleep we decided to have sex. After some fun, we both felt sweaty and hot in her stuffy room so I opened her bedroom door to let the room cool down.\n\nMy girlfriend then told me to watch out for her mom's cat because when she used to live here it would always get into the trash in her room, and to not leave the door open if I'm not in it.\n\nFast forwarding to today, I picked up some herb from the dispensary and packed a bowl. Since we don't smoke inside I grabbed my bubbler, grinder and such leaving my hands full and headed to the back porch for a sesh. Because my hands were full I forgot to shut the bedroom door.\n\nThis is where the fucked up part begins. Her family knows and doesn't care that I smoke. I have my medical card so I smoked even though her mom, dad, older sister and mom's neighbor friend were watching TV together in the living room with doors to the back porch.\n\nI get to the end of my session and I'm rather baked, and while writing this I'm still pretty stoned and cringing from all of this embarrassment. But anyway, due to the fact that I got more intoxicated than I anticipated I wanted to sneak off from her family and chill alone for a while to sober up, and play some Luigi's Mansion in the room while my girlfriend napped.\n\nWell that didn't happen. I open the screen door and as I walk in her family looks at me and I anxiously ask, \"Watcha guys watching?\" even though I asked that on the way out. Her mom chuckled and reminded me that they're still watching Tudors and then stopped speaking mid-sentence.\n\nShe gasped and looked at the floor causing the rest of the group to shift their attention from the TV.\n\"Ummmm... Professoroac... I think the cat has something of yours....\"\n\nI look at the look of horror on the neighbor's face, the disgust from her sister and honestly a disturbing lack of expression from her dad and then look to the cat.\n\nThe cat has a used condom in her mouth from the trash in our room. My hands are full, I'm stoned in a room full of my sleeping girlfriend's family and my cum is dripping from their cat's mouth onto the hardwood floors.\n\nI drop everything in my hands on the kitchen counter. I went for the cat who then began running around the living room spilling my seed now on the rug. Her neighbor friend jumps up on the couch and starts screeching and yelling \"ew\". Her mom can't stop laughing at this point.\n\nI finally grab the cat and take the condom from its mouth. I felt like I sprinted across the room. Threw it in the main garbage and grabbed papertowels for the baby trail left behind.\n\nWhile wiping up my mess no one says anything but I can feel their gazes burning into the back of my head. I threw it away and then ran into the bathroom to clean up.\n\nNow I'm still in the bathroom too high and anxious to face everyone again. My girlfriend won't answer my texts so I assume she is still in her room sleeping. I hear the TV is turned back on so maybe I can slip by them.\n\nMy thoughts are racing but I plan on trying to get back into our room without talking about what happened until another time. If someone says something I'll probably just make a joke or something and nope out of the room.\n\nTL;DR Went outside to smoke some weed. Came back inside to greet my girlfriend's family only to have her cat enter the room with a recently used condom of mine. An awkward chase ensued and now I'm cringing in the bathroom stoned as shit.\n\nEdit: Many people have preferred leaving the post with an open ending so the update has been moved to a TIFUpdate post with proof [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/i14yw5/tifupdate_to_tifu_by_leaving_the_bedroom_door_open/).",

My friend, B, said something funny and he\u2019s pretty talkative. I wanted to get a quick response in (like a couple words that didnt even matter. Something like \u201ci know, right?!\u201d) so i swallowed and went to talk. Only no words came out. \n\nI wasnt even really coughing. It was lodged solidly in my throat and the more I struggled the further down it slid. Slowly. B noticed and asked if I was choking and i couldnt respond so i just kind of coughed into the phone to confirm it. He tried to call 911 but lives in another state that will not connect you to another state\u2019s emergency services so it wasnt going to be quick enough. And theres like multiple locked doors for them to get through before they even get to me anyway. \n\nI was going to die. I started not being able to stand and started getting tunnel vision. I had tears and snot streaming down my face into my open mouth and didnt even care. I shoved my entire hand down my throat and nothing. Remember how i said i wasnt coughing and it was sitting in my throat? I had to actually make myself cough to move it at all. \n\nAnd then as i randomly started thinking of irrelevant things (i was losing consciousness and my focus was fading) i remembered this thing my ex liked when id go down on him. I had learned how to utilize my throat muscles in uhh interesting ways. So with my last ounce of energy i manipulated my throat muscles and forced them to shove the food back up. I threw up a golfball sized chunk of food right into my hands and stared at it (why was it so big?! Did i not chew AT ALL?!) before I threw it away and collected myself. \n\nYall i sat there stunned for like 5 minutes while B frantically begged me to tell him I was okay. I finally burst out laughing in relief and confirmed what was happening. Then i told him what i did to save myself and we both cracked up. But holy shit man, next time i might not be so lucky. \n\nTL;DR: I almost died. I gotta learn the self heimlich, i guess.",

I\u2019ve been in a similar position. Also, the dentist loves me, cleaning my tongue is a lot less unpleasant,  and when I had to be put on a ventilator I had less problems. I had aspirated and they hooked up the ventilator and waited for the fluid in my lungs to dry or something. When they took the tube out it was either cough all the gunk up or probably die. Having stronger than average muscles involved in the mix might have saved my life. Also, if it wasn\u2019t that.... so I overdosed off heroin. I\u2019m sober now it was a whole ordeal. But I was only using every 7 days at the time so I wasn\u2019t physically addicted. I was physically addicted to Benzo\u2019s. I wasn\u2019t awake to tell them this so the doctors assumed I was withdrawing off opiates. They gave me more and more fentanyl to treat the withdrawal and it did nothing for about 72 hours when the Benzo withdrawal let up.

For maybe a year prior to this, I had felt like I had something sharp stuck in the back of my throat. I thought it was a fish bone, about the same time it started, I had eaten some fish with really fine bones still in it. So, being the genius I am, I googled how to dislodge stuck fish bones from your throat. One suggestion was to ball up a piece of bread and swallow it with water.\n\nIn hindsight, there were multiple things that should have indicated this was a Bad Idea.\n\nI balled up what I thought was a reasonable size. Got some water. Popped it in, took a mouthful of water and swallowed. Sort of. Tried drinking more water. Drooled all over myself instead.

            "I saw your comment about the self Heimlich and it\u2019s very simple and easy. So the normal heimlich is to apply pressure to the diaphragm to force air through your airway to clear the blockage. When performing this on another, you clasp hands together and pull into the bottom of their sternum underneath the bone. You cannot apply enough force when doing this to yourself with your own muscles. What you do is clasp your hands in the same way, and put them there on your torso. Then lean up against a sturdy surface edge. The edge of a table or the top of a wooden chair. Then just thrust your body onto your chair or whatever through your hands into your stomach. It applies the necessary pressure at the spot you need and could save your life.",

There was this sheet of used plywood near this little hillock of dirt a couple of feet high, and I moved the plywood over to make a kind of a tilt board. \n\nI was on it, rocking this way and that, when I inhaled the spherical jawbreaker that had been in my mouth. There was this flash of weird quizzical mystery as I realized my lungs were utterly corked. I tried hard to exhale and force it up, but nothing at all was happening.\n\nSo I thought: _I'm going to see what God is like in a bit_. I was totally calm and unafraid. People tend not to believe me when I say this, but this is all true.\n\nI couldn't stand anymore and sank to my knees. Everything got kinda golden and sparkly, like the surrounding space was overlaid with backlit ginger ale. \n\nAnd then the jawbreaker shot out of my mouth and landed about 5 feet away.

I don't need any more qualifiers.~~\n I also did not intend for this post to become a chat about encouraging unhealthy and damaging eating habits. Please seek help if you are suffering from an ED or trying to find a \"quick and easy diet\" in the form of laxatives or other methods; these are damaging. I did not consider this intially, but it's something that has been made aware to me. The story might be written in a funny way, but that's my process of the events. It wasn't funny or cool that I lost weight and dehydrayed myself in this method. It was painful and I'm going to need some recovery.*\n\nEdit 2: Removed indentifiers and potential encouragement for harmful ED behaviors\n\n\n\nSo, here's the thing. I may or may not have a slight to moderate addiction to these delicious violet mint candies.\n(I'm choosing not to give away the name of the maker of these candies ~~in an effort to protect the small company.~~ I won't sully their reputation because I sullied my toilet.) \n\nI recently found these succulent fragrant treats again after trying them years ago on a whim. They are the perfect blend of strong fragrance and chalky texture. I am enthralled with them. \nOr...I *was*.\n\nI forgot all about them until that first fateful day, about 4 or 5 weeks ago, while browsing online for nostalgic candies.\n\nFuck up 1: I found the same brand of violet candies and was very excited to have them again. I ate all four packages of mints in an embarrassingly short time. I started having some minor poopy issues here and there, but chalked it up to basic bacteria and subsequently forgot about them. I even went to so far as to passively blame by boyfriend by asking him if our dinners were giving him issues too. \n(He has been picking up a lot of the slack in the cooking department since I got a second job. Bless him.)\n\nFuck up 2: Seeing how I needed to refuel my latest addiction, I went directly to the manufacturer's website and...you guessed it...ordered 2 WHOLE BOXES of mints. \n\n-Fuck up 2.0: Almost a moment of clarity-\nSomething told me look up the ingredients of the mints, just for shits (lol) and giggles. I briefly read something about - specific chemical name-, but the article had too much of that darn fancy science mumbo jumbo. So, I went on with my life, or...what was to become of it, my careless days of yore.\nI should have trusted my gut...literally. I've read that animals have basic instincts of impending doom, like a signal of their own death. If only I knew my impending doom would result in the lament of my toilet. My triumph turned to tragedy. My seemingly harmless addiction leading me into a dark bathroom of despair.\n\nThird and final fuck up, or, \"The Violet Flower Enrapture and Evacuation of the Bowels\": \nSince the delivery date of my precious violet goldmine, I prided myself in how well I was conserving the candies. I only ate a few here or there, and would just pop a few in my mouth at work. Luckily I have been busy with both of my jobs, so I only ate them at home for the most part.\n\nAnd so began the turmoil of my poor gastrointestinal system. I began to notice more frequent trips to the bathroom, oftentimes more and more painful and horribly-smelling diarrhea. I mentioned it to my boyfriend because I was becoming concerned. I told him \"It's the smell...it's like nothing I've ever dealt with. It's not normal, but more like a chemical smell?\" I even asked my boyfriend a few more times if he was having similar issues.\nI was also very projective and passive-aggressive about his cleanliness around the kitchen. I feel awful and know I owe him a big fat apology when I see him. Poor guy :( \n\n(Sidenote: I chalked these bathroom trips to stress from the recent zoom family therapy  sessions, thinking I was so clever for remembering that \"stress can do that to you, y'know.\" I totally didn't take into account that I was EATING THE MINTS DURING THERAPY. Yeah, I'm *such* an academic.)\n\n\nFuck up assurance and toilet resolution:\nA few days ago I started noticing my weight was dropping pretty fast. Again, in my brilliance, I credited this to me working a lot as well as quitting soda. I switched to tea and coffee. (I also thought the coffee was to blame, but coffee never gave me those painful, cramping, and horrid blowouts.)\n\nLast night I stayed up very late talking on the phone for almost 3 hours with my sister, catching up about stuff that happened in our family therapy. By the time our call was up, I had consumed 1 and one-third entire packages....about 20 mints or so in just that phone call's time. A new record. But there are no wins here, only profound losses.\n\nToday's Fuck Up Confirmation:\nI woke up a few hours later at the asscrack (lol) of dawn. I was strangely feeling hungry. Bf went to work. I kissed him goodbye and went back to bed. Or so I thought. A violent violet cramp began to rumble until I was nearly doubling over on my way to the bathroom. Total (violet) Recall. (Bonus Willy Wonka quote: \"You're pooping violent violet!\")\n\nAnd somewhere between my agony and my confusion, something just *clicked*.\nI went to search that pesky chemical I remembered from the ingredient list. \nAnd welp, what would you know: magnesium stearate, when consumed beyond small doses, acts like a LAXATIVE EFFECT...........Fuck.\n\nFor clarification: I consumed almost 14 entire packs of mints, plus a few extra from the first order, in 4-5 GODDAMN WEEKS?! I did the math for 18 packages....that's 270 MINTS. 270?!?!?!\n(My bowels when reading this: I gotta get outta here!)\n\nPls kill me.\n\nJesus Christ I'm so dumb it hurts. It literally hurts. My butthole. My pride. My self-assurance. But most of all, my butthole. \nThe memory of these mints has been tainted by my willful ignorance, now conditioned by my folly. I feel sick just looking at them now. \n\nRIP my sweet violet mints of long ago: once held in the light of careless happiness, now fallen to the deepest recesses of a hell where toilet blowouts reign.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - \nBut most of all, I'm sorry to you, my sweet innocent boyfriend. You're amazing and I will be reading you this after work. Love u bby :{\n\nTL;DR for those with normal gut health: I ate a fuckton of violet candies in a very short time and got horrible diarrhea for weeks. Turns out it was a chemical ingredient that caused a laxative effect. \n\nTL;DR Lite Version: Bad thing in candy make tum tum go ouchie. Ate many candy in short time. Feel sad and not smart in brain.",

            "So this was my mistake when I found a giant 5 lb bag of Andes mints on Amazon. My mom always gets me a small box from the store for Christmas and puts it in my stocking (I swear, my stocking is just my mom's excuse to buy more chocolate, so she can say she's using it for my stocking and then eats half of it before it makes it in. Not complaining... I mean, I'm 37 and still get a Christmas stocking full of candy from my mom, and I'll take any excuse to eat candy...) but I've never gone crazy with large amounts of them because I've never had access to large amounts of them.\n\nSo I was recovering from a lupus flare and a broken arm, stuck in bed for large parts of the day, and home alone for the most part because hubs worked from the office mostly. I get this giant box delivered, and my husband brings it up, watches me open it, and just goes \"this is going to end badly.\" I'd lay in bed either watching Netflix or reading books, and I'd snack on them without really thinking about it. \n\nI was fine, mostly, other than a sugar high, for the first couple days, but the 3rd day my husband came home to find me laying on the bathroom floor, moaning, with the cats all sitting around on various perches looking worried. (Well, ok, except Raijin, who is an asshole, and he was laying on my side, staring down at me like he was just waiting on me to stop moving so he could start nibbling on me... but that's him 24/7)\n\nI ended up sleeping on the bathroom floor, because I wasn't 100% sure that I'd make it from the bed to our attached bathroom in time. I actually broke down and ordered adult diapers after my second night on the floor, so that I could move back to the bed. \n\nDid that stop me from finishing the bag? Not a chance. But it's definitely on my banned purchases now. I'll stick with the small boxes that have like 20-30 of the mints in them.",

        "selftext": "So backstory. I, (36M) am the youngest of 5 children (boy-girl-boy-girl-boy) and we grew up in absolute poverty. Mom loved having kids but she didn't work and dad didn't make enough to support everyone. Poor enough that I remember as an 11 or 12 year old receiving a single plastic slinky and being absolutely thrilled I got anything.\n\nGrowing up with that kind of family was rough, parents got divorced and dad lived locally but didn't really do much to try to be a dad. Just support financially when legally necessary, and he let it slip once to me that he never wanted any kids. He just loved my mom and she wanted kids so he went along with it. Obviously with this kind of dynamic and the absolute lack of resources, home life wasn't great prior to the divorce.\n\nI was helping fix drywall at like 5 years old because we could only afford to live in crumby run down houses. I remember stripping paint with a steamer and putty knife at about 6 or 7 and only learned recently that the house had lead paint. Oldest siblings did even more housework and probably inhaled a bunch of lead dust and toxic substances. Couple that with the emotional abuse of our parents and they didn't grow up to be good people.\n\nMy oldest brother had anger issues and got kicked out of college for fighting people. He also got arrested a few times for stuff involving theft or violence. Oldest sister struggled with substance abuse, got arrested a few times, ended up involuntarily committed for 72hrs once. She's doing a lot better nowadays but still an unpleasant person. Next brother went on to just be an employee at a large chain store where I think he might be a manager now. All 3 still live in the impoverished town we grew up in.\n\nMy next sister and I are close enough in age that we're very similar. Both joined the military to escape the poverty trap of our hometown. I joined the Army and she went Navy, even at about the same time. While in the service, we both pieced together a bunch of things about  our siblings and parents that made everything clear. It was like we both had half of a connect-the-dots puzzle that made no sense, and when put together the outcome was a big sign that said \"EVERYONE IN THIS FAMILY IS AWFUL.\"\n\nShe confronted them about it after her contract ended and got kind of dragged into the drama all over again. She moved to a city near the hometown (about 1 hour away) and started working there right away. I cut everyone else out of my life. I hadn't spoken to most of them in years, and the others are cursory and obligatory in nature.\n\nAfter my contract ended I started college using the GI Bill which not only paid for my tuition, but also paid a monthly housing stipend so I can focus on school. My family fucking HATED that I was basically getting free school to them. Couldn't explain that it meant giving up 4 years of my life for active duty and I have to drill every month in the reserves, and part of my body is permanently wrecked; to them it is an unfair advantage. While in school, I had a habit of buying a lottery ticket every month when the GI Bill hit my account. It was borderline superstitious as I never had any notion of winning because I remember a statistic once that said men in California have a higher chance at actually being Brad Pitt than winning the lottery.\n\nMy final semester I won. I didn't win Fuck-You money by any means. I won the type of money where you could pay cash for a 3 bedroom, 2 bath house with .36 acres in a county where housing prices were below the national average and then have nothing left. Yes it's specific because that's what I did. I never told any family, including my cool older sister because as much as I love her she would almost be obligated to tell the rest of them. The purchase of that home happened when I was 25, so 11 years ago. Since then I got married and had a kid and have an all around nice and pleasant life.\n\nAbout a year ago, oldest sister was going to be near where I lived (several time zones away from family) for work and she wanted to visit me so she could meet my daughter and catch up. Against better judgment, I agreed because my wife wanted to know more about my family who she had never met.\n\nSo sister was staying with us for 3 days before she had to go do her work stuff and spent the whole time just reminiscing and catching up. At one point during dinner on the 2nd night she asked about what my mortgage must be like, since she paid $900 in rent for something much smaller and with no yard. My wife scoffed briefly, unaware that my family didn't know of my financial windfall.\n\nSister, though a troubled individual, is no dummy and picked up on that. Her tone shifted from casual to serious and asked \"What does that mean?\"\n\nI am not great at lying, improv, or doing anything without excess planning. I sat stupified while trying to figure out what to say before my wife said \"Well he used his winnings to just buy the house.\"\n\nThus setting off the chain reaction of questions that culminated with sister finding out I made 6 digits for free while \"attending college for free\" and \"getting rent paid while not doing any fucking work.\" She was absolutely livid and left for a hotel.\n\nAbout 2 hours later the phone calls began from every member of my family accusing me of cutting them off so I wouldn't have to share this gift from god. The sister I got along with even got angry at me for keeping it a secret, but she understood that it would have put her in a bad position of lying to family. My phone, email, and wife's phone began blowing up for the next week while family tried to get money from me not understanding that there wasn't any left. They kept saying that they're about to file for bankruptcy because of debt and I could save the family but I'm just being selfish.\n\nAfter a week, lawyers got involved because my family started threatening to sue me for damages for everything wrong in our family (they eventually did file). Every single thing that could even remotely justify going to small claims court or a full lawsuit was brought up. They even added up an estimated amount of gas money I borrowed since starting to drive at 16 with verbal agreements to \"pay you back later\" taking into account inflation and current gas prices. Everything together they asked for would have just been short of buying another house in cash.\n\nI'm able to post this now because I was able to get about 90% of it dropped for being absolutely ridiculous, and showing that a lot of their claims occurred during a time when I had no contact with them (thank you phone and email records). The remaining 10% of what they wanted was stuff that happened when I was 17 or 18, like denting one of their cars or injuring them when I threw an empty beer bottle during a fight and leaving a permanent scar where the glass cut them.\n\nAfter lawyer and court fees plus paying damages, I lost a bit more than $10k to family. The stress from the legal battle affected me at work and when it got out I was being sued by family after winning a lottery, all my coworkers began asking for help financially. It got bad enough (people coming to my home at night) that I had to request a transfer to a different branch where nobody knew me. Now I'm having to sell the home I bought, where my daughter was growing up in, and move to a more expensive city where the other branch is. All because I let my family back into my life\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: grew up poor, family sucked, joined military to escape poverty, found out family sucked even more than previously thought, went to college, basically won a house in the lottery, never told family, a decade later family found out, they sued me for every single thing they thought they could, I lost $10k due to fees, had to leave my job and move to a bigger city, all because my family sucks.\n\nMoral of the story: Don't let family back in",

But I was just reminded due to a past due bill in my emails, and you all seem to love my stories so, enjoy lol.\n\nI\u2019m pretty well endowed, and skinny, and flexible, and have the unique talent of being able to suck my own cock.  Judge all you want, make your gay comments, but if you could, you would.  No, it doesn\u2019t quite feel like getting a blow job, just like jerking off doesn\u2019t quite feel like getting a hand job.  But it feels fucking amazing, and i\u2019m a bit of a sexual deviant so it\u2019s just some added freakiness to a normal horny day sometimes.  I love it.  And ex girlfriends have loved it, random hook ups have loved it.  It\u2019s quite a party trick, let me tell you.  Lol.\n\nSo I met a girl on Tinder who, for whatever reason, our conversation swayed to this.  We hooked up, she really really enjoyed watching me suck my cock.  Now not to be too descriptive - but i have a very large head of my cock when I\u2019m super turned on.  Which, if I\u2019m sucking my cock I\u2019m super turned on lol.  I can get my mouth around the head, but I can\u2019t get much down the shaft.  especially as not much as I used to.  She kind of put me in these yoga positions to help, and it was insane I was able to get much deeper.\n\nLogically, I went home later and researched this and kinds of yoga and decided I was going to go to yoga to get more flexible so I could suck my own cock a little deeper.  Yup.\n\nI found a yoga place, signed up, and went to the first few classes.  I enjoyed it, but it wasn\u2019t really helping much and we really weren\u2019t doing the positions that Tinder girl put me in.  The next class, the instructor was helping out, and when she came to me she helped move me a little and it was super helpful.  Not in a self fellating way, but a yoga way.  After class she was chatting with people and to me she mentioned about working on the position at home and how to address it alone.   \n\nShe asked if I had been practicing long, and what my intentions with the practice are, and honestly, i don\u2019t know wtf i was thinking, but I fucking said it.  I said it!  Super non-chalantly too, I said \u201cwell, it\u2019s to help with sucking my own dick\u201d  \n\nShe didn\u2019t laugh.  She didn\u2019t say \u201cwhat?\u201d.  She just walked away.  Like quickly and angrily.  Not sure if anyone else around me heard, but it felt like I said it over the loud speaker.  I was cringing beyond belief and couldn\u2019t even hear anything but my heartbeat. I just grabbed my shit and left as quickly as I could.\n\nThe next day, I got a call from the studio saying the don\u2019t tolerate sexual harassment or inappropriate behavior of any kind.  I am banned from all 4 of their establishments and I am lucky the instructor doesn\u2019t want to press charges.  I wrote back apologizing and saying it came out wrong, but it sounded defensive, it is absolutely insane that I said that.  \n\nI think i\u2019m done with yoga.  And I\u2019ll just be okay with my self sucking skills as they are.\n\ntl:dr - went to yoga to get more flexible so i could suck my cock deeper.  and I told the instructor.\n\nedit - to answer some public and private questions... \nsure, I guess it feels like a dick is in your mouth, but in the same way jerking off feels like a dick in your hand, or playing with your pussy feels like you\u2019re playing with a pussy (i\u2019m guessing, lol).  to me the pleasure is the focal point.  but i\u2019m kinky and weird, so who knows.  i\u2019m guessing to enjoy it, you have to be comfortable with your own dick in your own mouth.  big deal.  i\u2019m more than comfortable with that.\n\nand onto the next question.  yes, I cum in my mouth.  Not every time, but i have many times.  judge away\n\nedit 2:  yes I have swallowed.  often the position requires i swallow or id spit it up all over myself.\n\nedit 3: yes, i\u2019ve cum on my face.  i don\u2019t think i\u2019m the only guy that\u2019s done that, that\u2019s happened just jerking off before.\n\nedit 4: okay, the photos in women\u2019s thongs are a a whole other story.  that doesn\u2019t make me gay still, i\u2019m not confused.  i just know what i like sexually!\n\nedit 5:  my r4r posts.... yes, I have met up before just to jerk off for them.  no i have never met someone before to do this act.\n\nedit 6: I\u2019m 41 years old\n\nedit 7:  I first tried sucking my cock in my teen years when i realized i was well-endowed.  i thought that self-sucking was the benefit of a big dick, later I learned about girls and stuff.\n\nedit 8: some of you are very mean, lol.  to go out of your way to DM me the things you\u2019re saying is weirder than sucking your own cock.  who cares what I do.\n\nedit 9:  i know i fucked up!  i was totally wrong and I believe she would be well within her rights to press charges against me and I\u2019m very thankful she didn\u2019t.\n\nedit 10:  damn people got real mean once this ended up on the front page.  yikes.  i guess the tifu crowd is a little more accepting than the popular crowd.  that was fun for a while but not really any more.  goodnight!",

Pregnancy brain kicked in fast, though, and I carelessly dropped the test in the trash under some toilet paper (I didn't what to touch my pee covered stick more than necessary) while forgetting my husband is the one who takes out the trash. \n\nCome next morning after the trash is taken out, my husband doesn't say anything so I think he didn't notice it. Come the 15th, we're grocery shopping when suddenly my husband starts crying and goes to the bathroom, I didn't want to drag the kids inside the men's bathroom so I call him on the phone and he, still crying, asks if it's his baby. \n\nThis MAN- \n\nI'm not about to have this conversation inside of a Fry's so I manage to get him out of the bathroom, we go outside, I tell him my plan and give him a hug and apologize and he's laughing so hard he can't breath and then tells me to never do that again before he apologized for running to conclusions.\n\nAnd then we went to get frozen yogurt. Food for the soul. \n\nTLDR - didn't tell my husband that I was pregnant, he thinks I'm cheating on him, breaks down in a grocery store, and then we go eat frozen yogurt.",

If you have a 4-year-old child together then presumably your relationship has lasted at least 5 years; if he's still so hung up on having been cheated on before that, it might be time to admit that it's impacting his life and he's not going to get over it on his own.

I asked if he was going by the bank, could he make a deposit for me? No problem. Gene rode his motorcycle to town. Long hair, beard, bandana, dark glasses, overalls, gloves.

Yesterday evening we went out to get some drinks and celebrate my successful second semester. My dad and me were pretty drunk, so we went home and fell into bed. Next morning my lovely mom made some breakfast for us, while we were still asleep. She woke us up with some coffee so we sat down in the kitchen. I couldn't eat anything cause my hangover was pretty bad. So my mom and dad started eating some scrambled eggs and some Wurstbrot (sausage sandwich). After a few minutes I started eating too. I took my first bite of the bread and recognized/tasted  what just happened. I had made some weed butter with some friends a while ago to bake some cookies. We made way to much of it so I kept the rest inside a plastic box in my fridge. Yeah.. so I took my first bite and realised that my mom took this butter to cook the scrambled eggs and even used it for the Wurstbrot. I was shocked and felt like frozen. I didn't know how to explain or even what to do from there on. My mom noticed my reaction and asked if everything is all right. I asked her which butter she used and she told me that she used the one which was already opened in the box. So I started carefully to explain what just happened before the weed may kick in without them knowing what is going on. My mom started to panic, cause she never done drugs and has completely no relationship to weed. For her its a real, hard drug.My dads reaction was pretty chill. He started laughing and tried to calm down my mom, cause he was smoking pot in his youth too. An hour later after my dad could relax my mom a bit, she felt asleep while my dad got pretty high. He started talking a lot about his time as a teenager and told me stories about some of his trips in and to Amsterdam. I am pretty glad my dad reacted that cool! Cause my mom isn't fine with it at all.As soon as my mom woke up the drama began again. She is still pretty angry at me and is disappointed cause she thought I would never do drugs. My dad told me she would calm down soon. They drove home a few hours ago.I think I never felt that weird and kind of helpless as today. Its hard to describe how it felt... awkward for sure!\n\nTLDR: My mom took my weed butter without knowing and made breakfast with it. My dad got high while my mom was groundbreaking disappointed and fell asleep.\n\nEDIT: So my mom called me today. She apologised that she seemed so disappointed she was only afraid of it. She told me that she never came in contact with weed even in her youth. She has absolutely no relationship to it. She said that she is proud of me and that I should be carefully with smoking weed.   \nThanks for all the likes, comments and awards! Didn't expect that to happen. I try to call my dad later and ask him if he is still into smoking weed.",

        "selftext": "Obligatory, this didn't happen today, rather three days ago.\n\n\nI've been single now for three years and haven't knocked boots with anyone in at least 2 so, finally fed up with celibacy and buffered by my friends success story, I joined a dating site.  \n\n\nI started talking to this pretty good looking guy. He was a little boring, we didn't have much in common but i figured meh, may as well meet up for a drink and so we did on Thursday evening. He looked exactly as he did on his profile (6\"8' power lifter who looked like a legit Viking) so there was an overwhelming feeling of relief that I hadn't been catfiished but I was pretty sure I didn\u2019t want to see him again after about half an hour of chatting. That said, he didn\u2019t seem like a murderer and there was a stirring in my loins, so I invited him back to mine. \n\n\nIt started well and I was like fuck YES, let\u2019s do this! So I said as much. I also said you\u2019re not going to call me back if we do this are you? He said he would. He\u2019s a liar. So bullet dodged. \n\n\nAnyway, he proceeds to pick me up like I weighed literally nothing which was exciting tbh because no one else has ever been capable of such a feat (I'm pretty large) and carries me to the bedroom. I\u2019m like STRIP because I\u2019ve gone rabid by this point from the carrying and the dominance. At this juncture, I realise that this guy is completely in proportion if you catch my drift but I figure babies come out of there so I'm grand.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s a warm up wristy and a little Spiderman and then we get down to bi'ness. It\u2019s over pretty fucking fast, like under a minute, so I open my eyes trying desperately not to look disappointed and he\u2019s just kneeling there with that soooorrrryyy look on his face. \n\n\nSo I\u2019m trying my best to reassure him that 12 seconds is totally enough then he looks down and his face goes pale and he asks have I got a tissue? My first reaction is shit, the condom broke but nah, it was much worse. \n\n\nBlood.jpeg\n\n\nSo much fucking blood. Well, I know it\u2019s not a wild period since I\u2019m not afflicted with that shit. I RUN to the bathroom (cream carpets) and holy fucking shit. I\u2019m like get me a bandage or a nappy or some shit. Meanwhile I\u2019ve never seen someone get dressed faster in my life. \n\n\nWe have a hasty conversation about the first inane bullshit subject that comes to mind and he leaves. I clean up the crime scene which is my bed and go to sleep thinking no more of it. Like it\u2019ll stop. \n\n\nNope. Next day is agony and still going. Trying not to do that thing at work where you have to lower yourself into your seat super carefully since a few people know I went on a date and I don\u2019t want them thinking I\u2019m some harlot. I'm still optimistic at this point that it'll stop.\n\n\nWake up Saturday, bleeding is worse than ever. But like fresh, bullet wound type blood. And I felt so sick and dizzy. I'm freaking the fuck out. Obviously can\u2019t tell my Mum because catholic shame so I go to the out of hours doctor by myself on the advice of the 111 lady (who I think thought I had been raped because I was crying so much because I\u2019ve broken my vagina) and just sit in the waiting room, silently crying whenever I think for too long about how this is probably the last time I\u2019ll ever have sex and it wasn\u2019t even that good. Mercifully, my buddy came to keep me company because she\u2019s wonderful.\n\n\nGet in to see the doctor. After a very sweet but obviously terrified middle aged Asian man and 2 nurse practitioners having a good old look, it's determined that I have a pretty substantial tear/graze which is going though a small blood vessel and because it's on a particularly mobile area of my lady garden, its unlikely to heal without a little help. Brilliant.\n\nTheres surgical glue on my vagina. I'm never dating again.\n\ntl;dr: Had sex with a giant Viking power lifter, ended up getting my vagina skin glued back together.\n\nEDIT: First, wow. I didn't expect this to blow up like this. Thanks for reading and thanks for the gold to those who gave it.\n\nSecond. To clarify, a Spider-man as I meant it is also known as the finger trick (middle and ring fingers in, the rest out, pull up repeatedly) although the PLAH!! Spider-man version is also great! Hope that helps.\n\n",

I\u2019ve been laid up in a hospital bed since then, so give me a break and just read the damn thing. \n\nWednesday night the BF and I were kid free for the evening and decided to go out on a quick date. Ended up having a blast at our local joint, then came home and did the deed. Wanting to spice things up a bit, we tried a new position. Don\u2019t get too excited, it wasn\u2019t anything acrobatic, just different for *us*.  I jokingly said afterward that I needed some Advil after cause I doubted I could walk afterwards. \n\n*ha ha ha*\n\nI would live to regret that joke. \n\nMy pelvic area began to ache about 10 minutes afterwards. I said to him \u201cI\u2019ll be right back, I guess I really do need an Advil\u201d and went downstairs. My pelvis began to hurt so I stopped  in the bathroom and immediately collapsed. The pain was surreal. My body began to shake. I started to sweat. I had my phone with me and frantically tried to dial my BF cause I couldn\u2019t muster up the breath to scream for him. My fingers fumbled about, I couldn\u2019t get my phone to work. I was losing consciousness. A few seconds later my BF comes downstairs to get something to drink and finds me on the bathroom floor. \n\nNext thing you know I\u2019m at the emergency room. 12 hours I was in the ER unable to move due to the extreme pain. I cried out and my vitals were crashing, I looked 3 months pregnant, my stomach was swelling. \n\nThankfully a nurse named Hannah stopped by and recognized my symptoms just as my stomach went rigid and my vitals tanked. I was rushed to the OR. \n\n2 hours later I\u2019m being awoken by a nurse and told that I had what was called a Hemorrhagic Cyst of about 6cm that had ruptured as a result of our sexual endeavor and was bleeding out into my abdomen at an alarming rate. How alarming? 2.5 liters of blood was removed during surgery from my abdomen. That\u2019s how much. I required a blood transfusion. \n\nRecovery will be long. My body is totally wiped. But at least I can say the sex was good. \n\nTLDR; Had sex and ended up almost dying due to internal bleeding from a ruptured cyst. Better now.\n\nEDIT:: Apparently the position is called \u201cThe Mating Press\u201d. \n\nAnd for the assholes who keep messaging me that I\u2019m a damn liar, here\u2019s some photos from the [ER VISIT](https://imgur.com/a/YmkQa5l).

            "The same thing happened to me - well not exactly the same, but I ended up in the hospital and unable to work for nearly 3 months because of a sex position that I never should've tried lol. I was 22 at the time and my gf was 19. She had a Cosmopolitan version of the Kama sutra and thought it would be fun to try some new positions. There was like a rating system for the difficulty of these positions; 1-5 stars, with 1 being something like missionary, and 5 stars being 9positions recommended for gymnasts and very flexible people. Of course the 5 star positions look fun and different so she wants to try one. Being the kind of guy that will do anything to please the woman I love, I make the mistake of agreeing to this. So we do this position and in the middle of it I feel an intense, stabbing pain in my lower back on the left and immediately have to stop. I'm in absolute agony and my back feels like someone stabbed me with an icepick and was wiggling it around. Eventually the pain lessens and I manage to get to sleep. That night the pain comes back and is just as bad as before, it hurts enough to wake me up. I decide to go to the hospital because this is definitely not normal and I had never felt this kind of pain before. So I go to the nearest ER and after about 6 hours and a few x-rays/CT scans the doctor comes in to tell me that I did indeed injure myself. It turns out that during these intense bedroom acrobatics (as I like to call it) I managed to herniate 2 discs in my back, an L5 S1 for sure and I think the other was L3 L4. So the doctor prescribed me percs and that led to a whole new problem that lasted 10+ years. \n\nAnyway, the injury was so painful that I couldn't work, often had to use a cane and I couldn't even stand in the shower. I had to get a bench to shower because simply standing on the very slight curve of the shower floor caused intense pain. I was out of work for nearly 3 months because I could barely walk and I had to decide if I wanted to have back surgery or just let it eventually fix itself (which seems to be pretty common). I had heard that back surgery is risky and that it could go either way; I could get better or I could get much worse. Eventually the pain subsides in a few months and I'm able to walk and work again. I made the decision at that point to not have surgery and to just hope that my discs will slide back into place or something. It's been about 12 years since it happened and my back is in pretty good shape now, I believe. I never got surgery and aside from some occasional back pain, it's never hurt quite that badly since. I have considered surgery over the years because there have been a few times where the pain came back and I couldn't really turn and flex because it would cause severe pain, but those incidents have been few & far between, and usually pass within a few hours or a day or two at most.",

I'm comfortable with my sexuality but the trade is inherently very macho and homophobic.(important later) So anyways, I had been looking for work for about half a year and finally landed a job with a local contractor. We seemed to get along fairly well so I was looking forward to working for him. \n\nWell, me being fresh out of trade school, I was naive and had a toolbox chock full of \"gimmicky\" tools and apparatus that were supposed to make my life easier but any veteran tradesmen would know is absolutely useless crap. One such example, my toolbelt had \"new and improved!\" hammer loops, which was a partial loop with two little spring loaded arms (they looked like pinball paddles) so you could just slap the hammer into the loop instead of sliding it in from the top. Sooo amazing...\n\nI show up for my first day decked out in my future-age carpentry gadgets and about 20 pounds of clothes because it was the dead of winter. After exchanging pleasantries with my new crew, I was shown where I'd be working: 30 feet up on a narrow scaffold plank with my new boss. No biggie.\n\nSo him and I scale the scaffold and begin working. At some point, my boss needs to get on the other side of me, so I scoot to the edge of the plank and he starts sliding behind me...\n\n*CLICK*\n\nThe front of his belt promptly gets lodged into my fuckin hammer holder. Like I said, we were wearing lots of clothes so it took a minute to see why we were stuck ass-to-balls, and we embarrassingly chuckled before trying to free ourselves. My hammer was in the loop already, so with his part of the belt in there as well, there wasnt enough room for the little arms to fold back and release me from my nightmare.\n\n For about fifteen minutes we shared that intimate moment on that scaffold, before another coworker came around the corner. After asking what the fuck we were doing, he proceeded to take a wedding's worth of pictures of us while laughing hysterically. I had had enough. I took my pliers and ripped off the arms on the hammer holder. Free at last, we worked the rest of the day in silence.\n\nI promptly went home and threw my belt into my wood boiler. If you ever want to break the ice with a new employer, just force them to spoon you on your first day.\n\nTL;DR my boss and I got stuck together ass-to-balls on my first day working because of my stupid belt\n\nEdit: it was extremely cold out and the suspenders attached to my belt were under about 3 layers of clothes. The only way to take my belt off was to undress, attached to my boss, on top of a 30' scaffold. Not happening. It may not have been 15 minutes, I didn't get out my stopwatch, but it sure as hell felt longer than that.\n\nEdit#2: The coworker taking the pics was my boss's stepson, so I'm not about to message him and ask \"hey remember 6 years ago when you caught me and your Pa spooning? Mind sending me the pics?\" Sorry to disappoint:(",

            "So my friends and I all planned a trip to sand dunes when we were teenagers in Arizona. We had a sandrail and a few dirt bikes with paddle tires all loaded up on a trailer and off we went. Things are going great and for several of us it's our first time seeing sand dunes and shit was a blast.    \n\n\n\nAll of this was put together by our friend Arian. Arian was a super nice guy, super funny, super caring, and the most fucking insane person I have ever met. Adrenaline junkie doesn't qualify, because I think even adrenaline junkies get scared sometimes. I'd never fuckin seen that guy scared. He sure was fun though. All the stuff we brought was his, except one dirt bike, I think.    \n\n\n\nThat sandrail had a v8 engine and 4 of us could lift the entire vehicle, so uhh...basically it was like riding an engine with 4 wheels and 5 point harness for driver and passenger. Saying it was powerful is liking saying, \"Hurricane? Let me get a seat beat on first.\"    \n\n\n\nWell, Arian took off with one of our friends and then they never came back. Dark rolls around, here comes Arian walking back to camp. Says they blew off the back tire, needs some tools, a bike, and a helper to go back with him.    \n\n\n\nI volunteered, because you know, I'm a fuckin moron. So anyways, he says, \"Hop on back and hold this flashlight so that I can see where we're going!\"   \n\n\n\nI think this sound reasonable, yeah...totally makes sense, he needs to see. We need to get the rail working and also save our friend that's waiting with the rail.    \n\n\n\nHey, you remember how Arian is fuckin insane? Dude wastes no fuckin time getting that 250 up to 6th gear and pretty sure we were gassing it through every band of power it had. It's pitch black. It's fine, I'm holding a Maglite...You know, so the driver can see.   \n\n\n\nI'm almost holding onto this psychos ribs tight enough to crush them and I'm barely staying on the bike. I can't see a fucking thing ahead of us. I sure as fuck know he can't either, because whatever light the fucking flashlight is providing is bouncing from heaven to hell. This is fine though, everything is fine.    \n\n\n\n\nThen the bouncing stops. It's suddenly a perfect smooth ride. I can hear wind gently kissing my ears as we are flying through this desert. I don't mean metaphorically flying. I mean we left the ground many, many seconds ago. We hit the top of a dune going, oh I don't know, 50-60 miles an hour?    \n\n\n\n\nSo after what seemed ten minutes, flying through a pitch black wind tunnel, we landed. You expect to land on wheels again, because that's...just how brains are designed to think when they're blind and the last thing you experienced was being upright.     \n\n\n\nWe did not land on wheels, we landed on our side, on the side of a dune. It knocks the wind out of both of us. We're both doing that, \"hoooooooo-eeeeeeeew-awwwwwwwww\" thing your body does when you've had the shit knocked out of you. We both still can't see. Neither of us know what the fuck is up or down. Neither of us can move.   \n\n\n\n\nThe sand dune impact was in a witches eye, a soft spot in the sand that was made from a dust devil swirling on that spot, or from wind cruising through two dunes in a way that makes a swirl constantly there. We were both buried to our right side collarbone, our right legs were buried. The entire right side of the bike was buried. It was like going to the beach and having someone bury just your entire right side, plus a friend, plus a dirt bike.    \n\n\n\n\n\nNothing is hurting on me and I ask Arian if he's okay. He says, \"Well I would be, if you had *held* the damn flashlight still, gosh\" this mother fucker! Now it dawns on me, we're just laying here....all snuggled up, nice and sweet. I've got Arian around his waist, my arms buried...just huggin a bro. He realizes it, too. He says, \"Can you get off me?\" and I'm 100% immobile. I can't even wiggle a tiny bit. I say, \"Nope.\" he starts asking, \"Well, can you move at all?\"   \n\n\n\nSo I nuzzled his neck, \"How's that, bro? That help?\"   \n\n\n\nApparently not. He got the picture and started digging us both out with his free left hand. Took us about 30-45 minutes.",

        "selftext": "As it\u2019s often the case, this didn\u2019t happen today, but a few years ago when I was maybe 15yo, young and naive.\n\nMy mom\u2019s best friend back then was V, a young woman in her late-30s, the widow of a really great man that had died a few years earlier, too young, because of a disease.\n\nV is a bright, intelligent, well-mannered and good-looking woman. After losing her husband and mourning his death for a long time, she started dating again. She brought to our home a few men over the years.\n\nOne of those times, V had invited over for dinner a man (let\u2019s call him A) who she introduced to us as a \u201cgood friend\u201d. A was a middle-aged man originally from Bosnia. He now lived in my hometown and run his construction business.\n\nFor those of you not fully aware of Bosnia and the things that happened there, brief history lesson. It\u2019s a small country in the Balkans (Eastern Europe, north of Greece), and it used to be part of the former Yugoslavia. Long story short, in the 1990s a civil war broke out there, and things got really, really ugly, many were murdered, and many fled, including A.\n\nThat evening, at dinner we were all trying to get to know A better. He seemed a nice, soft-spoken man, mature, and with a lot of experience on his shoulders. We start asking him questions about how long he\u2019s been out of Bosnia, etc.\n\nI start to think of something witty to say to \u201cvet\u201d him. Something funny.\n\nI asked him if he\u2019d ever killed someone, jokingly.\n\nHe looked at me, all serious. He said yes. Everyone became silent.\n\nHe went on to explaining that during the war he had to make some difficult actions a couple of times. They were those situations where it was either his life (and the lives of his beloved ones), or the other person\u2019s. He wasn\u2019t a soldier, but just a regular civilian looking out for himself.\n\nI felt horrible for asking this. When I thought I was just making a joke, I opened up some really painful memories. Things that were not easy for him. Still today, many years later, i can\u2019t imagine how he must feel living with such memories. And it was also the first time young me started to realize what war actually is, how it impacts real people around us.\n\nAfter a short moment in which everyone was trying to cope with strong emotions, the dinner slowly went back to normal. We never spoke about that again.\n\n\u2014\n\nTL;DR: I thought I\u2019d make a funny joke and ask my friends\u2019 date at dinner if he\u2019d ever killed anyone. Turns out, he did during the civil war in former Yugoslavia, to save his and his loved ones lives. The joke became immediately too serious and thinking about it still makes me uncomfortable to this day.",

            "First time commenting because this happened to me. I am an army guy (national guard now) and I work from home (Colorado) most of the time for a civilian employer in CA. I went out there to put some faces to the names and some stuff is just easier in person. My boss (that knows about my military junk) takes us all out to dinner to meet everyone and people start asking me questions about being in the army and what not. Mostly we talk about the dumbest thing that ever happened, how annoying all the bureaucracy is and the like. \n\nWhen relating to civilians I just sort of don't say stuff that either sounds psychotic or so ridiculous they won't believe you anyway. As a civilian I am a data nerd so the people I work with don't think all the tactical stuff is cool and I don't need to be on r/iamverybadass so mostly it is \"Sgt. Bilko\" stories all the way.\n\nWe were all having fun and this one woman let's call her G because she is great and I love working with her says \"what is the worst thing that ever happened to you?\" I was totally unprepared for the question, I dont ever think about that stuff. I just tried to say something to play it off, but I couldn't keep it together I completely broke  for like 10 seconds got all choked up tears running down my face etc. Anyway I felt horrible I could see everyone's face like total terror. (I am a medic btw) I pulled it together (sort of) and said something about \"how sometimes you are working on your buddy and you know there is nothing in your bag that is going to save him but you just keep putting more bandages and chest seals, look for more holes, add another IV, do a needle decompression, elevate the legs, wrap him up, take good notes, another set of vitals... You hold him and he cries for his mom and you cry a little and you just keep holding him and looking for the magic \"thing\" that will make the bird get there faster or make the chesttube work better. And you hold him and he dies.\" I am pretty sure I sounded like that one time you heard your dad cry when you were 9.\n\nThe reason I commented is because I felt like a total drag. I definitely wasn't upset at G and she probably feels terrible but I hope she knows that my bad experiances are not her fault. You asked a question as a joke or just out of curiosity and shouldn't feel like you did anything wrong.\n\nEdit for clarification: Very few service members are ever really prepared to kill anyone, it just isnt the job description for most of them. They are mechanics or clerks, unfortunately all the movies show the fighting, so people often feel inadequate if they never really saw any fighting. Some people end up in the wrong place and end up seeing way more than they were ever prepared to see; so on the one hand you often make people uncomfortable about their service like it wasn't enough or uncomfortable because it was too much. If you ask a Green Beret or a SEAL that has been around a while and you are friends they will talk to you about it if you are honestly curious.",

At the time, the Serbians had a doctrine of genocide against Bosnian Muslims. They would enter villages and murder all the men. My uncle's unit would figure out which villages were next and evacuate them. Severely underhanded, they usually had to march these villages out on foot. Many died of starvation just trying to get away. One day my uncle's unit captured a Serbian wearing a literal necklace of ears collected from Bosnian women and children. I shit you not. My uncle is honestly not a violent man. He would be such a gentle soul. After they were done interrogating, a couple men beat the guy to death but my uncle didn't participate. That's not to say he didn't have to take lives.

            "Well, this is bringing all sorts of stuff up for me. About 15 years ago, when I was still young and kind of stupid, I was driving down the main street in my town. It was a really rainy day, and the traffic was backed up. I was in a hurry to get somewhere, but it wasn't even important enough for me to remember. There was a traffic cop, and I rolled down my window and said to him, \"did someone die or something?\" To this day, I am mortified by my behavior.\n\nThe cop responded that a boy from the town had died in Afghanistan. He had graduated from one of the local high schools and the traffic was from all of the people waiting to pay their respects to him. I think I said \"oh my God\" and rolled up my window and tried to get as far away as possible. \n\nA few years later, I moved away, but I never stopped thinking about that boy, especially after I started really developing an interest in military issues.After four years away from my town, I moved back. The first year I was back, I went to his grave. I took flowers to his grave and wrote him a note. I told him how terrible I felt for the way I behaved on the day of his funeral and that I would do whatever I could in my life to redeem myself. It was again raining, so I put the note in a plastic baggie and laid it on his grave. I just really hoped that somehow, he would know how sorry I was. For the next six years, I took flowers to him every Memorial Day, and sometimes stopped by his grave to talk to him and to clean up the grounds a little bit.\n\nI forgot how it happened, but I ended up being connected with some of his friends and even his mom after I left that note for him. I guess they had been looking for me after they read it because they were touched by it. We are all still in touch. It makes me feel good to know that they're out there, living their lives, but that none of us have forgotten about him. I again left that town, this time probably for good, and before I left, I spent some time with him. Just talking to him and thanking him for his sacrifice. I am working on my PhD in counseling, and my specialization area is combat trauma. If I can just make life a little bit easier or better for somebody who has served my country, I feel like maybe I will have redeemed myself.",

And i noticed when he was napping when we didn\u2019t have anything to do, he allways slept with his right hand behind his head or pillow. And his eyes were slightly open as he was sleeping. One day we were driving a broadcast truck to our next location and asked if he knew that his eyes where open as he slept. And he told me that during the war he allways slept with a handgun under his pillow with his hand close to it. And he knew about his eyes because his wife told him he started doing that during the war. Probably because of stress or something. He also said he saw shit that nobody needs to see in your life.",

            "I've done worse. In college I met this guy who had the same name as a family  who owned the largest real estate business in town.  I asked him if his father was in real estate.\n\nHe said, \"yes, about 6 feet of it, he died last month\". \n\nI had no idea how to react.",

            "One time when I was like 10, my mom took me to her job with her. We were cleaning someone's house and the woman who hired my mom started talking about how she's lived in this home since the day she was born. So naturally me being a little idiot who got curious, I asked how old the house was.\n\nThis was then interpreted by everyone as me asking how old the woman was (she had to be in her late 60's). But no, I literally wanted to know how old the house was not her. My mom gave me a horrible look and said that's a very rude thing to ask while the woman and her husband gave an awkward laugh. So idk it confused the hell out of me for years and I never did find out how old the house was.",
            "Something similar when i was in sunday school. We were 8th grade and we went on a kick where us kids picked the topicas and how they related to church and religion etc. I chose the death penalty and if it breaks the commandment thou shall not kill. Little did i know one of my teachers had an uncle who was put to death by the state of Iowa for participating in a robbery where his partner shot and killed a guy. It happened in the 1960s and she explaind how he was the cool uncle that would show up for special family events  with rock albums and other cool items for all the kids. She never knew what he did for \"work\" until he got arrested.\n\nWe had a great discussion and we all learned a lot. She had a rough time but was happy to share her story. He was the last person killed by Iowa. They did it by hanging.",

            "Don't feel bad. I once invited a new friend over for dinner and, during conversation, found out he planned on going to dental school to be a dentist.

Finally the man told us a brief story that still haunts me.\n\nI won\u2019t tell it, because it isn\u2019t my experience to tell.

You had peeled of the scab and not looked into the wound. \n\nAs a curious child I pressed my father and remaining uncles for more information on my namesake's life and (untimely in Vietnam) death.\n\nDifficult as it was for them to talk to me about it, I feel like after my curiosity was satiated, we had a  deeper relationship. \n\nNow that they are all gone, I realize I may have been treated differently from my siblings/cousins just because I gleaned that bit of understanding as a young curious kid."

        "selftext": "I recently closed my lease in Florida to move back into my dad\u2019s house, in Chicago. I\u2019m working from home, don\u2019t need to be paying rent in FL if I can just live with family instead.\n\nSo, I pack my shit up, store the rest in a storage unit, close my lease, and hit the road. My cat, Randall Flagg, accompanied me in the car as we drove through Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, and then Kentucky.\n\nI was going about 105 mph in a 70 MPH zone when the KY State Trooper pulled me over. I was making incredible time moving that quickly, but obviously the risk is being pulled over. Or death.\n\nAnyway, State Trooper comes to the passenger side of my car to stay away from highway speed traffic. My car was already off, so my window did not roll down when I tried that. Instead, he opened the door.\n\nDuring the discussion, we actually addressed the fact that my cat Randall could escape, and I asked if I could step out and keep the car sealed. That didn\u2019t end up happening.\n\nAfter the traffic stop, maybe about a minute of driving later, I realize Randall is not in the car anymore.\n\n*Bolt of absolute panic*\n\nI pull over, again. This time without a state trooper behind me. I frantically shout for him inside the car. Check the foot boxes, seats, his little nooks, Nothing.\n\nMy mind racing, I leave the car on the side of the highway, and begin running back south to where I was pulled over. I reach the area, completely spent. Voice is totally thrashed from shouting over the sound of the highway for Randall.\n\nThe women who lives next to the highway, where I was pulled over, hasn\u2019t seen him.\n\nI have burrs all over my shoes and shorts from tromping through the Kentucky woods and fields next to the highway.\n\nI call the non-emergency number, my vet, my mom. Dad.\n\n45 minutes of shouting and walking along the highway.\n\nSerious emotional distress. My boy, my best bud is lost in these fucking woods somewhere.\n\nI see a state trooper nearby, he\u2019s very helpful and actually drives me back around to the area I lost Randall to keep looking, and gets the officer who pulled me over to come back also.\n\nNo luck.\n\nI interact with more nice families in the area, leaving my number with them.\n\nRandall Flagg is hiding somewhere out there and he is too scared to come out.\n\nOr. God forbid. He was hit. Cant think about that right now.\n\nThe officers help me relax, take me back to my car back north up the highway.\n\nA detective with the troopers helps me look around the car again, just in case. No Randall.\n\nMy car is now dead when I try to start it bc the hazards were on too long.\n\nGreat. I have some jumper cables stuffed inside somewhere, but it\u2019s full of my shit as I\u2019m moving, so I have to start pulling things out. The Trooper with me didn\u2019t have cables, somehow.\n\nSo I\u2019m pulling bags out to access the area where the cables are, when I see motherfucking Randall Flagg\u2019s fuzzy black ass inside a half-full garbage bag that had a lot of my clothes and towels in it.\n\nHe\u2019s totally asleep, peaceful as a fat baby.\n\nI apologize to the officers profusely but they are completely professional about it, just glad that he\u2019s been found. They help me jump my car, and I get rollin again.\n\nStayed much closer to the speed limit after that.\n\nRandall Flagg and I safely made it to Chicago the next day. He\u2019s extremely comfortable here at my dads.\n\nTL;DR I was pulled over and my [cat](https://imgur.com/a/7J6PxRU) escaped into the Kentucky woods next to a highway, but not really, he was just asleep in my car. I worked on my cardio and made friends in rural Kentucky while looking for him.",

Crazy experiences make good stories.\n\nPro Tip: Next time get a cage for him, or a leash. I have a modified leash with a seat belt clip. I just buckle him up so he wouldn't get out but at the same time it wont be restricting his freedom to move.\n\nCheers!",
            "My cat actually did escape at a truck stop once. I ended up buying a raccoon trap (one of the humane, live capture ones) and stayed there overnight looking for him. I was able to find him the next morning, but I was frantic until then. I\u2019m glad your fuzzball is safe and sound!",

I had rented a nice place, there was really no way for him to get out. I had to start work immediately, and I came home, and no kid.

Everything in the camper had been throw everywhere.  Nothing was left in the cabinets and most people would have rolled their rig with this kind of accident.  We looked for my cat in there for the 4 days it took to get things straightened out with the insurance and get a trailer to put our stuff in.  We tried calling him and looking under things and we couldn't find him anywhere.\n\nMy dad went in to check one more time before we let them trash it.

Also comes in handy if he likes to go for walks or on hikes with you. I have an old cat who prefers a harness to a carrier myself.\n\nThey also sell cat and dog harnesses for this purpose at the pet store for like $8.99, of course, but I figured the Walkin' Dude might like tooled leather with his name on it, like a cowboy boot, done up specially with a chamois lining so as not to muss his infinitely black fur.",

At some point, on the grassy shoulder (along the wooded side), we see a tiny, white, floofy dog. Running free as a bird, not a care in the world. Just happy as could be. Running.\n\nWe looked at each other, puzzled, and then sort of chuckled at the strange scene. He was just SO happy. I remember that vividly. There were a few houses along there that backed up to the interstate, figured he must have escaped from one of them, but honestly we didn\u2019t give it much thought. Just an odd occurrence that\u2019s instantly forgotten. \n\nWe continue on at 70+mph, and a mile or two further, we see an entire family on the shoulder of the road. They were looking all around the car, shouting into the woods, etc. Mind you, we\u2019re still running 70+, but by this point, we had moved to the left lane to pass some other cars. By the time we put two-and-two together, we were probably almost a mile past the family. Let me tell you, when we finally figured it out, we just sat in silence. Completely crushed. There was no way to get over in time to pull off; no way to turn around; no way to tell the family that their dog was a mile behind them, and getting further away every second. It was completely heartbreaking. I really hope the dog got tired of running and turned around to go back to his family.",

It\u2019s like every single cat-loving person is a victim of Stockholm\u2019s syndrome. I\u2019ve lived with cats, so dont give me some BS about how I wouldn\u2019t understand.  When I worked on a ranch, we had barn cats to kill vermin on the property.  When the owner got some ratting-terriers, they proved so much more friendly, reliable, and effective.  All the ranch hands enjoyed their company so much more than the taciturn felines that did nothing but shred people\u2019s belongings and leave shit and carcasses everywhere, the owner ended up putting as many cats as he could into a canvas sack and drowning them in the pond. The owner\u2019s wife was beyond happy to have squirrels, rabbits, birds and other small animals on the property again - she\u2019d missed listening to birdsong on the porch in the 7 years they\u2019d had cats on the property.  No one cared, because the cats never cared about us. \n\nWhat about them is so endearing?  What do they do for you?  By what Quantifiable or qualifiable metric do they improve your life?  Guarantee the only answers are \u201cthey push heavy things on my head because they love me\u201d \u201cthey go for weak spots like femoral and carotid arteries and Achilles heels because that\u2019s how they play!\u201d \u201ccasually destroying every piece of property in my residence is just how they establish territory\u201d \u201cwho cares about property value?  I\u2019m high on Toxoplasmosis fumes and ammonia!\u201d \u201cWhen they approach me to pet them for their own selfish pleasure and then walk away when they\u2019re content, they\u2019re showing *empathy*\u201d. \n\nYour cat is totally indifferent towards you and would kill you if it could.  It\u2019s life experiences, relative to you as the owner, will be an amalgamation of stories similar to this one. They are not pets or friends - they are solely self-motivated apex predators who try to kill everything they come across or milk them for unreciprocated aid. Just because it enjoys being pet by you does not mean it wouldn\u2019t be just as happy hanging out with a total stranger.  Best case scenario is to actually pick that dude out of your car and leave him on the side of the road. They are wild animals who prefer the woods anyways.",

I called him to tell him that we would be there in a few minutes. I didn\u2019t think about telling him that I already had the girls in my car. He asked me what to bring and after talking a bit he asked if I had brought some condoms. After a few seconds of awkward silence I just burst out in laughter and told him that he wouldn\u2018t need them anymore and hung up. His face when we picked him up was priceless. The girls kind of took it with humor aswell, but the next minutes of the drive were definitely a weird mix of awkwardness and laughter.\n\nThen I fucked up again after picking him up by reversing into another car :/\n\nTL;DR Had two girls in the car that me and a friend were about to double date, I call him on the car\u2018s speakers and he asks me if I have condoms.",

I'm the drummer, everytime I kick the drum it digs into my leg. I stopped a song. I stood up and waved everyone off and made everyone stop playing and did the whole,\" WTF is in my pocket it hurts!!\" Then took at a shinny condom wrapper and everyone saw, and I looked right at my now wife who just turned beet red.

            "This really counts in conference rooms that are equipped with table-top speaker phones. I NEVER say anything untoward about anything or anyone if I\u2019m in a room with those black discs of doom on the table. No matter what, it seems that someone \u2018thinks\u2019 they\u2019re on mute only to tragically discover they are not.\n\nCase in point: 10 years ago I was working on a truck product team for a major automaker and we had meetings with us folks at corporate and the assembly and components plants around North America. It was almost comical how often people would forget about those speaker phones and blabber about something they did NOT want overheard.\n\nOne day, the VP of the entire product line showed up for the call, which was not a regular occurrence. At that precise moment, some dick nozzle at the Wisconsin plant decided to make a joke about \u201cb\u00edtch boss lady\u201d and her brass balls. The entire room I was in Detroit just sat speechless as \u201cbitch boss lady\u201d took her chair and said, \u201cSo who is that talking so fondly about my testicles?\u201d The plant conference room was visible on a cctv screen in the room with us - 25 tragic \u201coops faces\u201d with eyes the size of dinner plates - until a moment later when the screen went dark and the call dropped.\n\nBoss lady had identified her \u201cfan\u201d by the end of the day. She took no direct retaliation against him but he was \u201cstrongly encouraged\u201d to take a buy-out deal and he was gone from a 23-year career by the summer.\n\nMy moral to the story is to always assume EVERY call is unmuted and EVERY mic is hot. It has served me well.",

            "I mean to be fair it's not unreasonable to assume a date may possibly lead to sex, and I don't think it's really rude to be ready for that. It IS rude to go on a date with the expectation that it will lead to sex. Better he asked if you had condoms like an adult than made some unnecessarily lewd remarks about what he planned to do with his date later or whatever. I think most reasonable women might be slightly taken aback by the remark, but wouldn't necessarily see it as this awful thing that kills the mood of the date. In fact it's kind of one of those charming \"life is awkward\" moments where you get to see behind the veil and into someone else's life and realize we're all goofy and awkward and fumbling around in the dark. I feel like most guys go on a date with at least some condoms in the car somewhere, even if they don't really think they'll use them. There's a good chance those girls probably discussed the possibility with each other before they got in the car with you. Now granted everything I've said assumes that beyond the condoms themselves you and your friend were otherwise upstanding gentlemen to the ladies in question, if you went on this date specifically to get your dick wet women tend to react negatively to that sort of thing-most of the time anyway... \n\nIt's also rude to reverse into someone else's car though. Can't help you there.",

It\u2019s quite funny. Go do something productive and donate to BLM organizations or post bail for a protester. Don\u2019t be a keyboard warrior\n\n\n\nThis happened earlier this evening. So it\u2019s my day off and I decided to take the day to pamper myself and this routine includes doing a charcoal face mask. This mask is, obviously, black. Masks are so normal that I have never once considered that it may look wrong on anyone\u2019s face, hence why I\u2019m a dumbass and didn\u2019t think twice about leaving the house with it on. \n\nI also never care much about what I look like. So when it was near time for my boyfriend to come home, right after applying my mask, I went to make dinner but felt really lazy and decided I was going to go through a drive thru instead. I honestly forgot for a split second I even had a mask on my face. \n\nSo I get there, order, and pull up to the window. The woman is an older (white) lady and she looks at me very weirdly, with a look of horror on her face. She doesn\u2019t say anything. I think, \u201cwhy is she looking at me that way?\u201d and hand her my card. I ask how she\u2019s doing and she doesn\u2019t say anything as she takes my card and shuts the window. I\u2019m like huh, okay. It dawns on me as I sit there that she\u2019s probably totally judging me for wearing a face mask out like a complete slob, and I chuckle about it. Then she comes back. \n\nShe\u2019s mad this time. She hands me my card back and goes \u201cactually, we\u2019re not going to be serving you. We have a zero tolerance policy for behavior like this and I\u2019m disgusted at what you\u2019re doing. Do you think doing this is a joke?\u201d And I am *completely* taken aback. I think she must have the wrong person and ask what I\u2019ve done wrong, to which she replies \u201creally? You\u2019re going to sit there and pretend you don\u2019t know exactly what you\u2019re doing? How can you be so disrespectful and do black face, especially with everything that is happening right now. What is wrong with you?\u201d And she\u2019s waving her hands at me while she\u2019s yelling. My stomach instantly drops when I start making sense of the situation and I start panicking. Word vomit starts tumbling out and I\u2019m trying to tell her that it isn\u2019t like that but she keeps yelling, and finally the manager comes over to the window. I\u2019m in tears at this point, not because she\u2019s yelling at me but because someone actually thinks I\u2019m doing something so incredibly vile toward other human beings. \n\nThe manager looks at me panicking, looks at my face and tells the lady to stop talking. I quickly tell the manager that I am *not* in black face, I\u2019m just in a face mask, and I\u2019m incredibly sorry for even leaving the house in it, but I figured it was okay going through a drive thru. The manager sighs really deeply and tells me she can definitely tell that I\u2019m in a face mask, and starts apologizing to me. She tells the lady \u201cDonna, people use face masks for their skin. That is not black face and you have completely embarrassed this customer....\u201d and starts chewing her out right there while I sit there awkwardly. \n\nAnyway, I ended up getting our meals for free, but I now know how incredibly stupid it is to leave the house wearing a face mask. \n\nTL;DR went through a drive thru in a charcoal face mask, lady yells at me and accuses me of doing black face, I freak out, manager comes and apologizes, I have learned my lesson",

It was a really cool project and he got some amazing photos.\n\nBecause he had the ultra violet camera anyway, and because it was summer time, we played around with it and he took portraits of me and some other friends. You can see some of the sun's damaging effects on the skin, especially if you're white, with a UV camera. We also took pictures of ourselves wearing sunscreen.\n\nIf you wear sunscreen and take a pic with a UV camera, it looks black because sunscreen is opaque to UV light. \n\nHe posted this pictures on Facebook and I was tagged in mine.\n\nSomehow it got shared and some idiot was going around saying I and some of my friends took pictures of ourselves wearing blackface.\n\nTo this day there is a picture of me wearing that sunscreen that is supposedly an example of me wearing 'blackface'.

I decided to take the bristles and carefully place them in my grandmother\u2019s hair, one by one. My mom was obviously in on it and kept her distracted by front seat conversation.\n\nBy the time we got to a rest stop an hour or so later, my grandmother basically looked like someone out of Hellraiser. We didn\u2019t tell her and she went to get her McDonald\u2019s coffee, completely oblivious. My mom was with her, and apparently everyone treated her with confusion and awkward, excessive politeness.

It was all laughs and funny - looking at people\u2019s cringe emo photos from HS, seeing people\u2019s questionable fashion choices, etc. Then he got to my profile, found those photos, and just went silent for a second before being like, \u201cDude... did you guys do blackface?

        "selftext": "This happened January, 2018.\n\nI was desperate to find a new job and was basically applying for anything that was asking for at least a Bachelor's degree. To provide some background, I graduated with a sciences degree and there was a job posting for a junior risk management position at an accounting firm that allowed folks with a STEM major to apply. And so I did even though I barely knew anything about the field of accounting or risk management. But hey, might as well.\n\nSurprisingly, they invited me to do a \"1-on-0\" interview where you basically stare at your computer webcam and answer questions that the company has prepared for you ahead of time while recording your answer... it's a pretty awful experience. However, they were all soft-skill questions so I could answer them pretty decently. After that, I surprisingly got an invitation to have an interview in-person at their office. I was very excited.\n\nNow for the fuckup: My family has an assortment of dress shoes that I could wear for the interview and I ended up grabbing a pair that belonged to my late grandpa. They were lookin fresh. I put em on and my parents dropped me off in front of the building.\n\nI entered the building and entered the conference room where the other 5 candidates were alongside some company reps. I was cool as a cucumber and just sat in my seat until everyone arrived. Right as everyone got up to enter the \"group case\" room, I looked down at my feet and noticed there were these black things scattered all around my shoes. I quickly deducted that they were shoe crumbs.\n\nIt turns out that the shoes I wore were so old and no one had worn them since... a long ass time ago. They were so old that the polymer in the soles were extremely brittle and my shoes were deteriorating in front of my eyes solely due to pressure and friction.\n\nAt that moment, I was just thinking \"oh god oh man\" but didn't want to let anyone know about it so after I got up, I pushed in my chair to hide the shoe crumbs. Unluckily for me, everywhere I walked more traces of my shoes came off, leaving a trailing of black shit behind me. It was a nightmare. Thankfully the carpet was greyish color so it wasn't too prominent with my black shoe crumbs but it was only a matter of time before people were going to notice. We walked to a different conference room nearby where we did a group case. It didn't go too well and I left another big mess in there but oh well.\n\nAfterwards, we were going to do the in-person interviews with the company directors and partners and divided us into two groups where three of us would go the interview first and the other three would do it after. I was a part of the latter team so we had time to kill. One of the company reps wanted to show us around the two floors and in my mind I was screaming. I wanted to minimize walking to prevent my shoes from breaking off even more.\n\nI ended up leaving a trail of crumbs all throughout both floors and then we decided to grab some Starbucks on the main floor. When I went to go grab a straw for my iced coffee, a giant block from my right shoe came off. Holy shit. I kicked it into the little condiments corner and hoped no one saw. We sat down at a table until our turn for interview was approaching. On the way back to the office floor, a second massive chunk came off, this time from my left shoe. However, this time I was in the middle of the cafeteria and couldn't go back to grab it or something. So I just continued walking and just left this black shoe turd in the middle of an open space. At this point, so much of my shoes have fallen off that I was starting to walk weirdly, as my shoes has gotten so much fucked at this point.\n\nWe got back to the conference room and the moment I entered the room, I noticed two other people hovering around where I was sitting originally and said \"what's all this black stuff?\" looking at debris I had left earlier. I pretended to not hear them and sat at a different chair, attempting to engage in conversation with someone else. At this point, I was 99% sure everyone knew it was me. However, I continued to play innocent and not acknowledge the amount of debris I was leaving behind everywhere.\n\nFinally, it was my turn to do the interview and I walked to yet another office to do it, and of course that meant leaving more shoe crumbs along the way and in the boss's office. He told me he was gonna take a quick bathroom break after we entered and will be right back. I was so glad he did that as I frantically picked up the crumbs that I had already laid waste upon his office and quickly stuffed as much as I could in my pockets while he was gone. As I was doing this, all I could think was \"how did it come to this...\". The interview itself went pretty well though.\n\nAfter everyone was done, the reps ended up buying lunch for us at a nearby restaurant. All I can say is RIP to the cleaning staff over there. By the time I got home, you could almost look through my shoe, top-down.\n\nNeedless to say, I did not get the job.\n\nTL;DR: Wore old af shoes to an interview, the soles began to deteriorate as I walked around and shuffled them, leaving an absolute disaster of a mess all around their offices as I continued to not acknowledge that I was the culprit even though I'm very certain everyone knew it was me.",

I ended up shuffling home in shame and sending my professor the bizarre explanation for why I wasn't in class. I don't think she bought it.",
            "I am in tears of laughter.  What a hilarious story.  Sorry about the job, but I'm sure when it's your turn to be grandpa, you'll have a great story to tell.",
            "wtf. I feel you. This actually happened to me before. But yours is worse since it was a job interview. My grandma gave me a pair of black shoes for school (we had uniforms) I was told that it was new. And that's the thing, it looked new. I wore it for the first time that day. I was in the public transpo and I noticed that there were little black crumbs around my feet and whenever I moved, more fell off. I thought it was gonna hold until the end of the day. I was wrong. I got to the front of the school and a huge chunk fell off from my shoe. I was horrified. I figured I was gonna end up not having any shoes if I waited so I just went home. By the time I got home, my shoes were barely shoes. I changed and went back to school (1h commute to get there) That day was unforgettable for two things- because of the shoes and because my dog died when I was back in school. I saw him for the last time when I went back home so I'm actually thankful for the self-destructive pair of black shoes.",

The flooring had been ripped out so it was rough cement like texture everywhere you walk. I didnt want any of my sneakers to potentially get covered in paint and found an old pair of nikes in the garage. Essentially the foam was so old and brittle as its been years since anyone worn it that every step I took it was as if little crumbs of cheese was coming off. In less than 10 min walking around to paint both shoes broke apart. To make it worse I was stuck at that house for 12 hrs and having basically been barefoot 10 minutes in was far from ideal.

        "selftext": "I currently live in an apartment building in Seattle. Nearby my unit is a man named \"Frank\" and his girlfriend (who is quite vocal, thus why I know her boyfriend's name). Now Frank and his girlfriend have incredibly loud sex throughout the entirety of Friday and Saturday nights. Annoyed by all of the sound and trying to find a way to blot it out, I began a habit a few months ago of playing music (singing, playing guitar) whenever they would start doing the dirty over the course of the last couple months. As an added bonus, I could hear my neighbors yell \"sing\" throughout the night, so I assumed that my playing was a helpful solution to an unfortunate circumstance borne by all of the other neighbors around me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, tonight, I noticed something kind of strange. They were having sex, per usual, and I began to play music to cover up the sound. I stopped to drink some water between songs, when some of my neighbors started yelling \"play.\" For some reason, though, I didn't do anything for a few seconds, and I heard the guy, Frank's, voice call out \"keep playing or I'm not going to cum\" through the walls. I listened a while longer to see if I'd heard correctly, and they both kept moaning the same thing. It was at this point that I came to a terrible conclusion. In my attempts to cover up the sound of them having sex, I managed to pull some weird Pavlovian trick where whenever they had sex, I played guitar and sang. Thus, whenever I started to play guitar to cover up an original sound, it just added to their voyeuristic thrill and they started to depend upon it to finish. When I'd heard my presumed neighbors yell sing, it was actually Frank and his girlfriend. Unsure if I was right, I started playing another song and when I finished, they were going as hard as possible and moaning heavily so I figured that I'd assumed correctly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy neighbors them get understandably angry that my music playing has made this neighbor couple have sex, so then ***they*** begin to have really rough revenge sex against my wall because they think that I've caused this problem (which I have). At this point, I'm listening to Frank and his girlfriend and the couple next to my wall, one couple horny and one full of revenge, and all of this was because I tried to save myself from listening to sex in the first place.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: here's a video I uploaded as proof that I'm actually playing music. They weren't having sex this morning, so everyone will have to leave that part to their imagination.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYOP3n2pxac&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYOP3n2pxac&feature=youtu.be)\n\n2nd Edit: Wow, this really blew up. Hopefully everyone enjoyed the story! Regarding proof of their sex, I\u2019m not going to record the sound of my neighbors screwing and upload it to the internet, so my apologies there. To answer everyone\u2019s questions, the song is an original, but I\u2019ve never recorded anything professionally and I play as a hobby.\n\n3rd Edit: This a few months later, but some people said that we should try to record the song, so we did! Hope those few that see this enjoy it!

Neighbors had angry sex against my bedroom wall as revenge for disturbing their sleep because I acted as a musical facilitator.",

        "selftext": "So I'm absolutely fucking obsessed with the Fruit Adventure flavor of Tic-Tacs. The flavor combined with the soft *smush* they make between your teeth when you chew them makes my brain very happy. I've been buying them in bulk, where each container has 200 candies each, and they come in bulk packs of 12 containers. I tend to eat them by the handful while I'm working or gaming, so in a day I can easily slam through 1-2 containers. \n\nNow keep in mind that on the nutrition label, it says the serving size is 1 candy, and is listed as having 0 calories, which I thought was awesome because I could have as many as I want! \n\nOver the past year, I found that I gained about 40lbs, and nothing about my eating habits had changed as far as I was aware. I told my doctor about it and she was a bit worried, so she had me do a bunch of bloodwork to see if there was a reason why I gained so much weight in a short period of time. Everything came back normal. She referred me to see a weight loss doctor who would also have me see a dietician. \n\nI had been working with the dietician for a few months now, and we have me keep a food log. I had a virtual visit with her today and during it, I was fiddling around with an empty container to keep my hands busy. She saw it and asked where I got such a large container from, so I told her about it and how I eat 1-2 of those per day. She asked why those weren't on my food tracker and I said it was because they're 0 calories so they wouldn't count. \n\nApparently I was very, very wrong about this. She explained to me that food companies can label something as being \"0 calories\" if the food's serving size contains 5 or less calories. In reality, each individual Tic-Tac actully has about 2 calories. So essentially, since each container has 200 pieces and I typically have 1-2 of those, I've been eating 400-800+ calories *per day* of Tic-Tacs, in addition to all the other food I've been eating - which is very likely why I've gained so much weight. \n\nTL;DR: Didn't realize that tic-tacs weren't actually 0 calories and gained a ton of weight because I eat so many a day. \n\nEdit: Just wanted to clarify that I'm aware that sugar will in fact make you gain weight (I'm not *that* stupid), but I never actually read the product ingredients. I assumed they must have been made with something like Xylitol or some other artificial sweetener to make them \"0 calories\" so it never crossed my mind to check!\n\nEdit 2: Dang y'all are brutal lmao. But at least some good came out of it since apparently, like me, a lot of people didn't realize about the \"less than 5 calories per serving\" rule can legally be classified as 0 in the US. Personally I wish we could have the model they do in other countries where they list calories per X amount of grams. \n\nEdit 3: MY TEETH ARE FINE \ud83d\ude02 I actually just had a dentist appointment two weeks ago. No cavities or decay, gums are healthy. Despite my candy habit I do take good care of my teeth!",

I asked him why he didn't just use butter or margarine and he said it was because the spray butter was zero calories. I had to explain the whole concept of \"per spray\" and did the math to show it had almost the exact same calories as margarine. His wife had gained about 30 lbs since they'd married the year before, and it was apparently because most of his diet hacks meant she was actually eating more calories than ever.\n\n\nETA: Remembered another one. He was buying low calorie bread, but never compared the calories to regular bread. Just assumed it was much, much less. Instead of serving her 2 slices of regular bread each morning (190 calories) he was serving her 4 slices of lower calorie bread (240 calories - slathered with \"zero calorie\" butter spray, of course).",

        "selftext": "I have been working from home recently (obviously), and I am pretty fortunate because basically there is no function of my job I need to be in the office for. But I have let some bad habits seep in. \n\nI'm sure anyone in an office knows that like 80% of the meetings you attend could probably just be an email. But since we are meeting via Zoom, and since a lot of people don't even enable video, if I am in a meeting I know isn't important and where I probably won't even have to speak, I just mute myself and go sit on the sofa and play a video game on mute or browse the internet or whatever. Or eat lunch. \n\nI have an odd quirk that I do when I eat by myself. I talk to my food and to myself. On the day in question my lunch I had a sandwich and some pita chips with hummus. So, for example, I said something like \"Mmmmm, there's hummus among us!\" Or when I had a chip I would say things like \"That's what I call a chip!\" or \"Welcome to my Mouth, Mr. Pita!\" \n\nAnd the sandwich, I pretended it insulted me, so I was like \"Did you just call me a bitch? Hooo boy, you just buttered the wrong biscuit. NOM NOM NOM NOM!!!\" Or later I would comfort it, like \"Don't worry, had my fiber gummy, you're coming out smooth. Mm hmmmm.\" \n\nI wasn't really listening to what was happening in the meeting, but finally I heard my name a few times. To my horror, I had not muted my mic. They heard it all. My Manager was saying rather curtly, \"Can you please mute yourself?\" Some people were laughing. I mumbled an apology and muted myself. I got a stern message from him later saying I should wait for lunch until after a meeting, and if i had to eat during a meeting, mute myself. \n\nIn our Slack channels people are making fun of for talking to my food. But it is clear, they think I am insane. In the eyes of my Manager I have lost all stature, and in the eyes of my co-workers I am a lunatic. This could have negative effects on my career. I am actually thinking of quitting tomorrow. \n\nTL;DR - I didn't mute myself during a Zoom meeting and my boss and co-workers heard me talking to my food.",

Which, we get it. No one wants to be on a meeting that could/should have been an email. But someone scheduled that meeting, someone is talking and presenting, which means there's someone invested in it and you basically told that someone, \"Your meeting is fucking worthless and a waste of my time.\" \n\nObviously you didn't mean it that way, but that's the message that's going out. And as your manager, your behavior reflects on me, which means even if I don't really give a shit that you're making small talk with your comestibles, I'm still obligated to say something so that it's clear I don't condone unprofessional behavior.

Also treat online meetings as actual meetings and try not to multitask house chores.\n\nA side note is for chatting, it is better to use a separate device for personal chats as not to accidentally send personal messages to coworkers.",

I'm going to the doctor later today, but in the meantime had to attend a Zoom meeting this morning.\n\nI was in this Zoom meeting with about 15 other people when I unmuted to ask a question. I leaned back in my chair to really give off the beard-stroking academic vibe, and I heard a crack as some piece in my old AF Ikea desk chair exploded and the chair back went all the way backwards. And so did I.\n\nBoth of my cats, situated nicely under the computer monitors on my desk, did what cats do when there's an unexpected noise and completely lost their noodles. In classic kitty form, they destroyed everything in their path, knocking my mug off the desk and onto the floor, shattering it.\n\nMeanwhile, I lay on the floor on my back having a huge coughing fit. I untangled myself from my chair and headphone wires and got up to go grab my inhaler. In the process, I stepped on some pieces from the shattered mug with my bare feet. I let out another round of cough-laden expletives as I walked away.\n\nA few minutes later, I had my shit sorted out and came back to my desk and keeping with the theme of pandemic-related TIFU posts, I realized I had been unmuted the whole time and with my video on. Apparently my colleagues had just spent that time conjecturing on whether I had left my earthly body behind or what.\n\nMinus 5 points professionalism for me, plus 10 points hilarity.\n\nTLDR - unmuted on Zoom, chaos ensued.\n\nedit: removed cat tax so my fuzzballs don't dox me",

His 2 kids ran in, around 2-4 years old and he jumped up to usher them out and was in his boxers! He came back and saw himself in his underwear on the screen and was embarrassed and kept apologizing. \"I'm so sorry, that was unprofessional of me. It won't happen again.\" The older man, his superior, said \"that's alright\" and stood up showing his boxers too. It was so funny! \nPS. The kids were adorable and that was cute too.",

I thought I was deep in the woods. I was pulling my two toddlers behind me in one of those cart things you can hitch to the back of a bike for kids to ride in.

I ditched my bra and was wearing a loose tank with buttons all the way down the front. I undid them all. Was at a level of \u201cfuck it we are all going to die here\u201d. GPS was not working.\n\nAnd then ....I stumbled into a field adjacent to a parking lot I\u2019d never been to before. Into a crowd of 14yos and their parents. Some had grad gowns. I had my tits flapping in the wind, my progeny hauled behind me (tied to my butt, like the banana boat girl), and mud almost to my elbows.\n\nA nice gentlemen offered me directions.

        "selftext": "WARNING: THIS IS A LONG ONE. SCROLL DOWN TO THE TL;DR IF YOU DON'T WANT THE FULL STORY. \n\nYeah... I f***ed up today. See, I've been dating my GF (K) for 5 years. We are deeply in love, we have pets together, we live together, etc. I've wanted to propose to her for about 2 years. The reason I haven't is that about 2 years ago, I got diagnosed with a rare disease and have been on and off several medications and chemotherapy. \n\nIt's been VERY rough on the two of us, but K has stuck with  me every step of the way. My disease, GPA, is chronic, deadly when left alone, and tough to beat in my particular case. I'm starting drugs that haven't been FDA approved for my condition. All other typical forms of treatment have failed and things are kinda bleak, but not terrible just yet. This new drug is promising, but hasn't been guaranteed to work. I'm terrified to say the least. All of this medical stuff has prevented me from being able to go outside, let alone commit to anything serious. \n\nI want to be healthy and stable before I even think about marriage. I don't want to leave K as a widow with no support! K & I had talked here and there about getting married, but had always come to the conclusion that I needed to go into remission first. We agreed to it, or so I thought. Flash foreword to a few hours ago and K is with MY FAMILY in a public restaurant, holding a ring and getting down on one knee. \n\nI saw my father, who has an extensive history of butting into my private affairs without asking to be involved, with his eyes wide and smiling. I immediately started freaking out. First thought: I haven't even gone into remission yet and I have no clue if I'm going to get better. I cannot get married and then hear that the drugs aren't working. What if I die from all of this? Second thought: GODDAMN IT DAD! Why do you always have to try and manipulate everything from behind the scenes?!\n\nI guess I'm coming off as a bit of a brat here, but my Dad was a very involved parent when I was young. When I entered High-school, my father would play me up to college recruiters, my boss at the time, and to teachers. The expectations would get so high that I couldn't live up to them. Similar situations happened with friends and extended family as well. Both my brothers and I find this to be a real problem, if my Dad is left unchecked. I would go more in depth, but that is a post for another r/. Back to the story!\n\nAnyway, I'm freaking out. I just start sputtering the first words that come out of my mouth. Sadly those words came out as a hodgepodge of \"no-nno waaay!\" With my heart beating out of my chest and a lump in my throat, I ran out of the building... I made the love of my life cry as I selfishly drove off and everyone in the restaurant dropped their jaws. I've never felt so ashamed in my life... After calming down, I talked to my Mother, and drove back to talk to K.\n\nIn the parking lot, without my family, we discussed what went down. Tears were shed and things were said. K told me I was being selfish. \"We've been dating for years, who cares if you die, I want to marry you!\" She also explained that the whole proposal was her idea, my dad had nothing to do with it. She understood why I would be paranoid about my dad though. K understands that my Dad has boundary issues and admitted that it would have been better if she didn't include them.\n\nIn the end, we reconciled. We made up, decided that I was being redicules and paranoid, and she wasn't forthcoming with her real feelings on marriage, engagement, and how my disease effects our relationship. We came to the conclusion that we should be engaged. We want to spend the rest of our lives together, no matter what the circumstances.\n\nNow I'm engaged, still have no idea if my new drug is gonna save me, but if I do end up in an even worse place medically during it all, I'll be with my best friend/lover. K is my world, and I'm an idiot for ever considering not spending my life with her. \n\nThanks for listening.\n\n\n\nTL;DR\nI said no when my GF proposed bc I'm on chemo and don't know if I'm gonna go into remission or die. Decided I was being stupid and reversed my idiotic decision to yes.\n\nEDIT: Thank you so very much for the silver, gold and platinum!",

            "If you have a possibly terminal illness, marriage makes a BIG difference to you and your partner. It means that nothing and no one can deny K the right to visit you and be with you if and when you are dying.  It means that she, and not your parents, will have permission to make medical decisions for you if you are incapacitated -- this may be very important to you if your dad tends to be controlling. And it will make it easier to pass on any property to her if you do die; you would likely make her the beneficiary of your life insurance. Whether or not you get married or are merely engaged, you should write a will and a medical directive.",

If you were to die everything you have (unless your will said otherwise) would likely go to her including life insurance policies. If she were just your girlfriend anyone else further up the line (pretty much any family member) could get a lawyer and come after everything. \n\nSure it sucks but honestly marriage doesn't hurt you in any way and she already has the emotional attachment that you would leave her behind with if you passed.

            " Sorry for long post- I just relate a lot to what you've said!\n\nI was diagnosed with GPA Spring of 2018 in the middle of my engagement. It was absolutely horrible, and at one point I was lucky to get an hour of sleep a day. I could hardly eat, couldn't shower on my own, couldn't even open a pill bottle on my own. I 100% would not have made it through the whole process without my (now) husband by my side the whole time. He slept next to me on the couch for months when I couldn't walk the steps up to our bed, he took care of everything at home, stayed for days on a horribly uncomfortable recliner in my hospital room, he was amazing. And through all of it, he was just as terrified (if not more) as I was.\n\nI've been in remission since Summer 2018, and in August 2018, I married my husband. My wedding was a million times more special after what we went through, and it was a stark reminder that nothing is ever promised and sometimes you have to live in the moment instead of waiting for the ideal circumstances to arise. I remember being terrified that I wouldn't be better by my wedding, but I was determined to tie the knot, even if I had to be wheeled down the aisle (I was completely fine by my wedding, just hopped up on a TON of prednisone). It was vital for us to profess our love to each other and make that commitment no matter what the rest of our life looked like.\n\nI'm incredibly lucky to live an hour from the Cleveland Clinic. After my hometown doctors brushed off my symptoms for months, I was finally able to see a rheum at the Clinic, and was eventually admitted there for a week due to renal infarcts. The Clinic has one of the best vasculitis programs in the world, and if you continue to have problems I highly recommend trying to get there if you have the means. They quite literally saved my life.\n\nI know how you feel right now, but just know that things can get better. You will get past this. Aside from taking some lovely maintenance drugs daily, I'm doing better than I was before my diagnosis, and my husband and I are expecting our first child this November. Stay strong, and lean on each other through it all. I wish you a life full of health, love and happiness, TOGETHER.",
            "I\u2019m having a lot of health issues as well. And I\u2019ve been with my husband for almost 5 years. We got married this past June because as I told him, if god forbid something happen to me, I want to know you\u2019ll be there in the room with me. I don\u2019t want any fucking person telling me that my husband (yes I\u2019m a gay male) that he can\u2019t be in the room because he isn\u2019t my \u201cfamily.\u201d I also wanted to ensure he\u2019d be able to care for me if I ever can\u2019t care for myself. We\u2019re both very afraid of the future; he afraid of being alone without me and I being afraid that he\u2019ll lose himself if I pass. Marriage is something that\u2019s special and worthwhile but do it when you\u2019re ready but keep in mind: if you get too sick and you\u2019re family for any reason doesn\u2019t like your girlfriend or partner down the road, they can legally bar them from being in the room because they won\u2019t be viewed as family. It\u2019s a terrible thing but it happens, mainly to gay people but still something to consider. I hope you get well and can live a happy life with your love! Have faith and keep your head up!",

She doesn't see it the same way a lot of the time, she feels like a burden or a loser because she cant work due to constant hospital stays. I would highly suggest seeking out a therapist for yourself, that is the one thing that has always helped my gf and i recently found out she started going to her therapist again and I can already see the difference.

Sure your parents may be involved, and she'll probably turn to them in any event, but she's confirmed in front of your family she wants to be involved in your life.  \n\nYou are at a frightening time, we all understand that,  and it weighs heavily on your decisions.

Being married will give her extra benefits, she will be your next of kin and able to make medical decisions for you instead of your parents (without jumping through extra hoops to allow her to if you were just engaged.) If you have life insurance she will be the default beneficiary. If there's a medical emergency, she will be allowed in as family without jumping through hoops.\n\nThere are a lot of stories here about people who have been in similar situations. I'll throw one in about my best friend- My best friend got engaged and before the wedding she was diagnosed with what turned out to be terminal cancer (so a little different on the timing). They went head and hurriedly did the wedding in her hospital room (it was beautiful) right before her bone marrow transplant. They planned a \"Remission/Wedding\" for when that day came. They opted to get married right away for a number of reasons, both practical and sentimental. She was able to take his last name, which was deeply meaningful for her, he was able to take family leave from his job, among other benefits. Unfortunately that day never came, but I know they were both very grateful to have been married to each other, even though it was only for a few months. Their marriage also gave him a permanent second family, as he is still very close with her family. She will always be his first wife if he remarries. Not just another girlfriend.\n\nHopefully things work out better for you. But if not, K's life is going to be impacted to the same emotional level regardless of whether you are married or not. There is a wonderful community that comes with widowhood, K could carry your last name if she chose to, she could receive benefits, depending on your circumstances. You may be better able to look after her if you pass if you two were married. It is worth conversation, I think. \n\nGood luck with your treatments! I hope you and K have a long, happy marriage!",

If you continue to spend money on treatments after you get married, they may be able to go after her assets too (though I don't believe they'd be able to get your debts that you held prior to your marriage).  Also, be wary of common law marriage.

It's typically a wrong number call. I'll pick up the phone, say hello, and the person apologizes and hangs up. \n\nBut lately I've been getting a lot of spam calls about some car I don't own. Almost every other day they call me, and it gets annoying. So I've started answering in strange ways. You know the drill, pretending you're from a Denny's in New Mexico, pretending to be a scammer, etc. No harm done, right?\n\nWell, just a few minutes ago, I got a call from an unknown number. I thought it was the car people. So I answered, in my best peppy receptionist voice: \"This is Jimmy's euthanasia clinic and buffet, where yesterday's loss goes in the sauce! How may I help you today?\" There was a long pause. After a few seconds, I said, \"Just kidding. This is \\[my name\\]. Who is this?\" A few shuffling noises came from the other end, then silence. I hung up.\n\nAbout thirty seconds later, I got a call from the same number. I said hello like a normal human being, and the caller introduced himself. It was the tech guy. From my school. He was calling to follow up on a very professional, respectful email I sent him a few months ago about school-issued computers. \n\nYikes.\n\nTL;DR I answered what I thought was a spam call and said something stupid.

If you\u2019ve ever dealt with them, you know they\u2019re the worst about this. So one day, I got a call from an unknown number and decided I would answer in my politest, highest pitched voice, then switch to yelling at them to stop calling me. Before I could yell at them, I figured out the person on the line was calling to ask me about a job application I had put in.

I would give crazy out of the way directions to anyone that asked how to get there.  Customers started calling corporate pissed off and wanted to \"fire the guy that answered the phone\".

I was tired of coming home to half a dozen blank messages, so I changed my answering machine message to the following:\n\nHi, I can't come to the phone right now, but if you leave a message, I'll get back to you as quickly as I can. (The previous standard message.) If you hang up on my fucking answering machine, I will hunt you down and kill you.\n\nWhat can I say, I was 19 maybe.\n\nAnd then I went to the eye doctor to pick up my glasses after getting a message on my machine that they were ready. When I showed up and gave my name, the two girls at the front desk looked at each other and said \"we didn't hang up, we swear!\"\n\nAnd then I changed my message back.",

            "To keep myself amused, I used to answer my work phone (when it was an outside line calling in) using different accents - mostly Irish or Scottish. Generally the calls were 2 minute calls and I could keep the accent going for the duration (people calling to ask something simple about a document in our Land Titles system). \n\nThe day I decided to stop doing this, I answered with a pretty flamboyant Irish accent. The caller, who was actually Irish, was calling to inquire about a sole survivorship application - his wife had just passed away. I flipped into professional and compassionate mode but had to try to keep the accent... for what turned in to a 25 minute call. \nMy Irish accent sometimes flips to different regional accents, occasionally it even sounds Scottish if I try to do it for too long. I have no idea what he thought of the situation, but after that call, I vowed never to do it again.",
            "I got this call from the \u201cIRS\u201d. The person accused me of owing them money and that i better make a payment or face jail time. I listened and gasped at the right times while I rooted in my desk drawer for this little package of fireworks that I had found in a storage locker I bought and threw in there to light some time. I pulled one out and went outside to my packing station where I have two large army tins that I use for trash and recycling. I told the guy my Nana was sick and that I needed those $500 for her medicine. Guy on the line starts berating me even more and keeps insisting I\u2019m going to jail. I light the firecracker and throw it into the almost empty bin. I had been growing more upset and frantically begged him for mercy. \u201c I can\u2019t take it anymore! I screamed dramatically and put the phone next to the outside of the can. There was a loud bang. I put the phone up to my ear. \u201cOh fuck oh fuck oh fuck\u201d he said. Sir! Are you all right!

Testing wasn't widely available in my country at that point so I had no choice but to stay home despite otherwise having pretty safe working conditions at the office. Anyway, I had to give my private cell phone number to a notoriously annoying guy who worked for one of my customers. We're talking about a guy so annoying that even everyone at that company itself makes fun of him behind his back but who won't ever be fired because he's friends with the owner.\n\nWe had our call in April and it was all fine, but then months later I got another call from him on my phone. I helped him with his problem and politely asked him to call our office phone next time because I was back at the office and the number he had stored was my private number. He said ok and we ended the call.\n\nA few weeks after that I received a call from a number I didn't recognize in a week when I had been bothered by several LinkedIn recruiters. After picking up the guy on the other end said his name rapidly and unintelligibly which I've started associating with annoying recruiters, so when he asked if he called at a convenient time I replied pretty bluntly that I was working. Only after that did it become clear who he was so I ended up sort-of apologizing and mentioning once again that he needed to stop calling my personal number.\n\nA week later he called again during my vacation and this time I recognized the number.

        "selftext": "During puberty, the body goes through many changes as a boy becomes a man.     \nThe voice deepens, musculature increases, genitals grow and gain hair, a beard and moustache come in, and the feet develop a hard, protective crust.    \nAll natural physical development. \n\nOr so I had assumed until this weekend, when our \"pod\" got together at the beach for a little summer fun.   \n\nI've always enjoyed walking barefoot on the beach, as the gritty sand tends to wear down the thicker calluses and slough off shedding skin layers.   \nSometimes I would even use a pumice stone to sand them down thinner so that they wouldn't tear up socks as badly as when left natural.\n\nNow, I've never really paid attention to feet, never really looked at them closely or had a fetish for them like you hear about, so even with partners playing with their feet just wasn't something I ever did. I've seen women's feet in movies like the toes scene in The Big Lebowski, but assumed women just have softer feet than men. I probably had plenty of opportunities to see other mens' feet at the pool or gym showers, or wherever, but without having really any interest in feet, I can't say I've looked closely at anyone's feet, ever. \n\nBut on this day, one of my guy friends was wearing bright purple nail polish.   \n\nIt caught my eye, naturally, and it occurred to me that somehow his toenails were long and flat, like fingernails, not white and bunched up like toenails.  And his protective calluses were almost missing!  Not the sanded-down smooth appearance from walking in sand or using a pumice stone, but virtually absent altogether!  I wondered if this meant he didn't often walk barefoot, and so never developed them, or if he had some method better to sand them down.\n\nSo I asked, \"Hey, I noticed your nail polish, your new style?\"        \n\"Ha, no, my daughter wanted to practice, and couldn't say no!\"      \n\"I couldn't help notice how flat your toenails are, and you have almost no calluses -- do you use some sort of special cream or trimmer to get them to look like that?\"      \n\"No, they're just normal feet.\"       \n\"But you don't have any calluses on the bottom.  Normal feet have calluses to protect them when walking on hard or rough surfaces.\"  \n\nAnd showed my foot as an example.\n\n\"Um, wow,\" he said, \"how long have you had that? Are you taking any medicine?\"        \n\"Taking medicine? For what?  These are just normal feet with normal calluses.\"        \n\"No, no they're not, that's like the worst case of athlete's foot I've ever seen.  How long have you had it?\"    \n\"I don't know what you mean ... my feet have always been like this ... this is just how feet _are_.    ... isn't it?\"      \n\"No, not at all.  That's foot disease.  It's some sort of fungal infection.  There's medicine for it.  Have you never heard of athlete's foot?\"      \n\nYes, I had heard of athlete's foot.  From TV commercials advertising creams to treat it.  But they never showed _pictures_ of it, nobody had ever told me what it _was_, and nobody for over thirty years after I went through puberty mentioned that there was anything at all wrong with my feet.\n\nNever has a doctor mentioned it to me.     \nNever has a partner mentioned it to me.    \nNever has a coach mentioned it to me.  \nNever has _anyone_ mentioned it to me.\n\nI just thought that's how feet _are_.\n\nEpilogue: with the obligatory \"this happened two weeks ago,\" I immediately visited a dermatologist the next business day, got a diagnosis and medication, and my feet are already halfway through a magical transformation.  It's incredible.\n\n---\n\nTL;DR: While going through puberty my feet developed thick calluses and I thought this was a normal part of growing up.  Nobody ever told me my feet looked strange, I never compared my feet to others, and I never realized anything was wrong with my feet until asking a friend how they made theirs so smooth and they told me I had athlete's foot for thirty years.     \n          \n^(Edit: typos, formatting, &c.)\n\n---\n\nUPDATE: Since everyone is asking for photos, I've uploaded in-progress treatment photos [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/vUtBQZl).  The first photo is of my toenails, the second of my heel.  All toenails used to look like my little toe looks now. They are growing in flat and translucent now.  The pinkish areas on my heel and side of foot were also covered in the same white-yellow callus three weeks ago before seeing the doctor.  And the callus was _MUCH_ thicker and flakier.\n\nFor illustration, the top picture in the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athlete%27s_foot) and the \"side of foot\" photo on the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/athletes-foot/symptoms-causes/syc-20353841#dialogId27257934) site are almost _exactly_ what my feet looked like before.\n\n---\n\nUPDATE 2: The medicine prescribed was Terbinafine, a prescription daily oral anti-fungal pill. It is apparently quite strong, requiring regular blood work to monitor liver function. The doctor expects it to take six months to be completely cured including new toenails growing out cleanly.   The doctor took skin samples and ran tests to confirm it is indeed Athlete's Foot, not other similar conditions people have mentioned.\nNOTE: This is apparently a very powerful medication which as noted can affect liver function, and many pharmacists and others have commented to note that people taking it are not supposed to take paracemetol/acetaminophen or drink alcohol during the treatment.\n\n---\n\nUPDATE 3: The kind redditor /u/berneealf wrote out a [lengthy comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/o9fipx/tifu_by_seeing_a_friends_bare_feet_asking_their/h3ddmaw/?context=3) detailing a care regimen that mirrors a lot of the other good advice given in the various comment threads.

            "Alright my man, I have some advice you should read. I have fended off athlete's foot since I can remember and I have never had to use any ingested medicine. I think you should follow your doctor's advice, but that medicine may trash your liver. DO NOT take any other medicaments during this period without consulting with a doctor. Painkillers (ibuprofene, paracetamol, aspirine) are all synthesized in your liver. Combining them with Terbinafine can be really dangerous. Alcohol is also synthesized in your liver, I don't know if your doctor told you to suspend alcoholic beverages, but at least take it easy on the drinking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow on to my personal treatment. Your feet look like a pretty advanced micotic infection, dermatrophyte fungi like the one you have require a damp environment to thrive. This may mean you have a case of hyperhidrosis AKA you're a sweaty bastard. Most people never develop micotic infections up to this point. The problem is, after you are done with your treatment and are dishcarged by your doctor, your feet will still be sweaty bastards, therefore you are prone to developing an infection again. That is not the only problem. Fungi spread through spores like plants spread through seeds. Spores are microscopical and airborne so they are likely everywhere in your closet (specially your shoes and socks). Sweaty feet + spores = relapse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow to combat it: This will not in any way hinder the treatment prescribed by your doctor, on the contrary, it is likely to accelerate your healing so you may drop the Terbinafine sooner.\n\nAbout 6 years ago, I read that the US army treats athlete's foot with vinegar. Soldiers have little choice for footwear and socks, so they repeat often and end up with damp feet, add that to comunal showers where spores spread from one foot to another and you end up with an institution that knows how to handle athlete's foot. \n\nFungi cannot handle a strongly acidic or basic PH. Mix 1 part of white cooking vinegar and 1 part of water, soak your feet for 10 min daily and dry thouroughly. This treatment has worked wonders for me and it's easy and cheap. \n\nPurchase an over the counter anti micotic cream. There are many avaliable and they work well. Apply it once a day on clean feet.\n\nSpend as much time as possible barefoot. Airing prevents dampness.\n\nLast step: rub your feet with a callous remover once or twice a week, this will help you remove the dead skin that provides a perfect environment for fungus, and your feet will recover faster.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat is it for my treatment, but you might want to think about addressing the spore situation (the fact that there are spores all over your closet). I'll be honest with this one, it hasn't worked for me. I enacted a very thorough closet cleanup twice in the past when I was sure I had no present infection. In the end the infection returned after some time (granted, a lot of time). So I ended up with a halfway solution. As I said, spores are microscopic and airborne so I wasn't able to eliminate them entirely (or I might have caught them soewhere else). The solution I came up with was using vinegar to kill the spores in my shoes and socks. Make a stronger mix than what you use on your feet (2 parts vinegar for 1 part water). And soak your shoes and socks everytime you wash them. Voila! You have succesfully hindered their reproductive cycle.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPrevention of future infections: \n\n1. The most important step is to cycle your shoes, and have a wider assortment of shoes so you don't repeat often (hey you will also devolop a more fashionable closet). Overusing the same shoes leads to accelerating fungal development. Don't store your shoes in your closet when you take them off, give them one day to air-dry before storing.\n2. Prevent dampness by spending as much time as possible with bare feet, and applying talc on your shoes before putting them on.\n3. Check your feet: The fungus is very likely to return, but it will be very easy to get rid off if you catch it early. Early signs of infection are bad smell, itchyness, small lumps and redness in the skin.\n4. Keep one of those anti micotic creams and some white vinegar at hand. Once you notice an infection, you can effectively treat it in under a week with those 2 things.\n5. Keep an eye for itchyness on other parts of your body. Crotch-itch is caused by the same fungus as athlete's foot. In my case, I noticed that by using a special sponge just for my feet (I used to use 1 for all of my body) I greatly reduced breakouts on my face. Fucking fungus was givind me some acne.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell my friend I put some effort into writing this for you in hopes you will find it helpful.

Now, I generally go to my parents house to work on my truck (my dad has spent a lot of money on his truck, and thus has a well stocked garage. Plus I live in an apartment complex and don\u2019t have a garage).\n\n\nSo I\u2019m going over there to do a few things, put some braided stainless brake lines on, and do an oil change.\n\n\nThis is where it happens. Now, my parents have two dogs. And I was trying to sneak into the house and being as quiet as possible, as I knew my eldest sister was house sitting and I didn\u2019t want them to lose their shit.\n\n\nThis is where the fuckup happens.\n\n\nIt works. I\u2019m quiet. I sneak into the house, and silently close the door. I heard some strange noises coming from the living room, so I go, thinking the dogs were playing.\n\n\nIt was not the dogs playing.\n\n\nIt was, in fact, my eldest sister and her boyfriend. On the couch.\n\nWith her sitting on his lap facing away from him, towards me with her eyes closed.\n\n\nI have now seen my sisters birthday suit being penetrated by her boyfriend.\n\n\nI also now know what my sisters face looks like in this process. \n\n\nAnd what she sounds like.\n\n\nI literally screamed \u201cmy eyes\u201d covered them and ran out of the house.\n\n\nI\u2019m outside, sitting in my truck contemplating my life.\n\n\nSend help.\n\n\n\nTL;DR Parents home is vacant other than my sister dog sitting. Went to work on my truck, saw my sister getting worked on, reverse cowgirl style.\n\n\nEdit: Based on a lot of the responses, apparently reddit wants me to either A) Describe my sisters tits, B) Make a porno, or C) Go all r/sweethomealabama with her.\nY\u2019all are animals.\n\nEdit 2: Holy shit this blew up.

I\u2019d had a couple close calls with people riding bikes along the path (my fault, I only really owned dark colours), so whenever she looked behind her, I\u2019d turn around and look behind me, because I thought she may have heard a bike bell that I hadn\u2019t heard over my music. Meanwhile I kept my speed up because I was on pace to beat her in our race to my turnaround point.\n\nNear to my turnaround point it gets quite dark, because trees hang over the path; and it\u2019s of course here that I finally catch up with her..\n\nAs I get within two metres of her, she suddenly spins around and enters into what I can only describe as a karate/taekwondo attack position (legs braced and arms ready). Aimed directly at me.\n\nI immediately realise what I\u2019ve done (wearing dark colours, looking behind me when she did, powerwalking towards her).\nI gave her the most awkward smile in the world while I powerwalked past her, walked WAYY past my turnaround point so I could avoid her on the way back, and seriously considered powerwalking myself off the nearest cliff.\n\nAs an added \u201cbonus\u201d, I later learned that there was a notorious rapist named \u201cthe bike path rapist\u201d that operated in that specific area of the bike path a few years prior.\n\nTL;DR Decided to race a stranger without their knowledge, awkwardly followed them, caught up to them in the darkest section of the path, nearly got Bruce Lee\u2019d, awkwardly smiled and powerwalked away.",

            "Fun story - When I was in highschool me and my friend would get together most nights of the summer to hang out, drink our parents booze and smoke of that green machine.  \n\nIt got late and I decided to head home which was about a 20 minute walk down a pretty main street. As I was walking home I noticed a stranger on the opposite side of the street walking the same direction who was walking at roughly the same speed.  As I was finding something to kill the boredom of the walk I thought to myself \"You can beat this guy!\" so I started walking faster and faster trying to out pace him.  This went on for several blocks and I'm started to get pretty tired and feel like I'm walking about the same speed a speed walker would be going at...like I was basically running but still keeping it to a walk.  However every time I turned my head there he was keeping pace without even knowing I was racing him.  And I was GUNNING IT so I really couldn't understand how he was doing it.  Especially since he didn't know I was racing him.  \n\nWhen we arrived at the street I turn off to go home I had to cross the street and wait on the same corner as the guy I was racing for the light to change.  As I get to his side I can see he is as gassed as I was, sweat pouring from his head  and he just looks at me with a BIIIG smile and says \"Wow! That was one HELL of a race huh?!\".  We both chuckled for a bit as I realized he was racing me too! We chatted for a while about it and said our good nights.  I still laugh when I think about it.  Life's funny sometimes.",

            "Did this once myself. I'm about 6' tall, 195lbs. Love to hike and was hiking a path in the woods between two neighborhoods. It wasn't night, but it was closing in on dusk and even with the majority of leaves already fallen, it was a bit darker in the woods. It was late fall so I was wearing a hoodie, wool cap, wearing a backpack, and had fairly thick beard growing. I like the exercise so I was walking at a pretty brisk pace. Mostly I had my eyes down since there were a lot of roots, rocks, and leaves along the path. I glanced up to see a teenage girl walking her little dog. She's maybe a hundred yards in front of me. She appeared as if she was looking past me and she looked terrified. She abruptly turned the other direction and starting moving away from me quickly.  I'm normally not worried hiking in the woods, but that look on her face made me instantly jog a few quick steps just to put some space between me and whatever she saw. I glanced over my shoulder, but didn't see anything. When I looked back up towards her, she had picked up her little dog and started running up the path away from me. Now, I'm full on scared. I spin back around trying to locate whatever she saw. I spun my backpack around to the front-side, unzipped it quickly, and pull out a hatchet and knife that I always have in there. I still can't locate anything as I'm slowly backing up. I glance over my shoulder toward the girl who has turned up a path that leads to a neighborhood. I don't know if she saw me still, but she was running as fast as she could. For the life of me I couldn't find what had scared her so much. I was assuming it was a rabid dog or maybe the rare, but not unheard of, mountain lion. With the lack of light and prior experience encountering big cats on a wilderness trail, it was about the most scared I've ever been. After few seconds, I also bolted up the trail, stopping and covering my back every 10 yards or so. It only took me a few minutes before I got out of the woods and into the neighborhood, which is also the neighborhood I grew up in and where my parents still live. I walked to my parents house and told my mom all about it. At which point she kind of laughed and informed me that the most likely cause of this girls fear was me, the big, dark-hooded, thick-bearded stranger who was double-timing it right at her. \n\nDuh. \n\nIt would have been hysterical to have some footage of me running up the trail, spinning around every few yards, wide-eyed and white knuckled, defending my back from some unseen entity that only existed in my mind...ready to fight to the death.

I can't stand the family that lives across the street because their kid is always fucking freaking out and screaming, slapping shit, having tantrums, throwing shit across the street and into my yard...you name it, he does it. I can literally hear his fucking tantrums from my house across the way. He's a little fucking hellion. \n\nHis hobby, other than having shitfits, seems to be hanging out right by the picture window and staring me down when I get into my car and leave for work. I got so sick of being stared at by this little asshole, so I flipped him off and gave him a nasty look as I was getting into my car. He immediately started screaming and crying. As I drove off, I felt...weirdly satisfied. Seriously, it was the most fulfilled I'd felt in WEEKS. So, I immediately did it again the next day, the next one after that, and the day after that. Each time he'd start screaming and freaking out. It made me bitterly happy.\n\nThis morning, as I was getting ready to leave, I saw the demon child in the window again...giving me THE STARE...and I flipped him off. Only this time I heard the bellow of \"HEY FUCKER!\". The kid's fucking dad had been standing behind him and I didn't see him. I sprinted into my car just as he came running out of the house. I got in before he caught up with me, but that still didn't stop him from throwing a potted plant at my tail light.\n\nI'm at my girlfriend's place right now; my roommate tells me that the fucking psycho has been to the house twice looking for me. Kind of dreading going back; thinking that I'll just hang out here for the long weekend and hope it all blows over.\n\nTL;DR: I've been flipping off my nasty little four year old troll of a neighbor for almost a week now. His daddy caught me doing it this morning and now I'm probably gonna get my ass beat.",

My gf is planning to surprise me on my birthday by reuniting with her high school metal band and putting on a show for me.\n2. My gf wants to tattoo the names of literally all the Harry Potter spells on her back, but she doesn't know how to tell me because she's afraid I'll talk her out of it.\n3. My gf casually mentioned that one of the unexpected differences between her glasses and her contact lenses is that when she's on her knees looking up at me with her glasses on, my penis looks much bigger compared to what it looks like through her contact lenses, which is why she's keeping her glasses on during sex (ouch).\n4. My gf is convinced that my parents are swingers because apparently there are always attractive couples hanging out at my mom and dad's house whenever we visit. \n5. My gf secretly finished the entire series of Better Call Saul without me, even though we agreed to finish it together, so now she's pretending to have no idea how the show ends. \n6. My gf is thinking about cancelling the high school metal band reunion for my birthday because she's no longer sure if it's appropriate to team up with two of her exes that are original members of the band. \n7. My gf expects her dad not to like me. \n\nI would've preferred not knowing most of those things to be honest, but there is no way for me to unlearn Afrikaans, so now I'm cursed with knowing too much while having to pretend I know nothing.\n\n**TL:DR** \n\nI secretly learned my girlfriend's native language as a surprise, but during my learning phase I became capable of understanding what my girlfriend was gossiping about with her friends when she thought I didn't understand. I've come to regret not telling my gf that I was learning her language from the beginning because I know things now that I wish I never knew.",

This is gonna win him over.\n\nLater that night when she asks when you learned it, and I mean after everyone else has gone home, you can tell her the truth about how long you have been practicing but take the high road from there dude. She hasn't cheated on you. She hasn't done anything that would make most couples break up. She just has some small things she is embarrassed about and doesn't want to lessen your opinion of her.

Turn it into the fact that you are just an awesome boyfriend who learned a new language to impress her and her family when you met them, and who had let the small stuff slide if she asks if you've over heard her.

I'm a sporty person, mountain biking, hiking year round, etc. I also have apparently a hairy butthole, which means wiping the ol' pooper can be somewhat of a chore at times. Sometimes, unbeknowst to me, not everything gets removed, and I don't know if you have ever let somewhat digested stomach acid (AKA the Taco Bell runs) gently rub between your greater cheeks for an entire day before, but it AIN'T FUN. So I had the bright idea to shave my bunghole. Less hair, less clean-up, less chance of rectum-related-rashes on the next mountain bike ride. So I trimmed it off at night, added some Aquaphor to the affected area (that stuff is magic), and the wiping job is smooth as butter the next day. Win-win!\n\nFast forward two days, and I'm going on a first date with a pretty cute girl. Classic dinner and dessert kinda thing, cuz she's like the best looking girl I've dated, so I wanna shell out the monies of course. Dinner went pretty well, and we got Coldstone afterward, and then we decided to head to my place (hoping my roommates aren't home) for a movie. Turns out they aren't home...which is extra nice, because we both were throwing mad hints to each other about how attractive we found each other.\n\nBut, guys, I can feel it building...inside me...the gas, not the sexual tension, unfortunately.  We're sitting there on the couch watching a movie, and I just had to let one out. I'm usually pretty good at silent farts, so I'm not paying attention to the fact that we're in a quiet spot in the movie. And this fart was NOT SILENT! It was the loudest, flappiest, most percussive fart I've ever had in my entire life, hands down. I was mortified. She immediately turned her head toward me with an expression of pure disgust, and I of course was super smooth about it and tried to awkward-laugh it off, which is my response to most tense social situations. She did not laugh with me...No text-backs so far.\n\nI googled it this morning, and it turns out shaving your butt makes your farts extra loud, cuz your buttcheeks slap around with no hair to muffle the sound. So a little TIL there for you inside this TIFU. Just waiting for my anal fuzz to grow back now, so I can go on dates again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit2: Man I shouldve used my real account for the awards! Guess I'll have to switch over to this baby.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - I shaved my butthole to make wiping easier and prevent rashes. Turns out it makes your farts super loud, which I discovered during a movie in my apartment on a date, which ended awkwardly and soon after.",

            "Obligatory...\n\n> I have recently made a mistake in my life, and I offer my story to all though tasteless, that you may learn from my error. It all started, as many things do, with me having trouble pooping. No, I was not constipated; this was not a regularity problem but a matter of technique.\n> It seems my ass-hair had grown to such a length that tiny grogans were constantly getting tied up in the matted jungle between my asscheeks. It led to much frustration, with me KNOWING that I still had something to drop, but unable to shake the tenacious turd loose from its butthair dwelling.\n> \n> Eventually I would have to do two things: either reach down with somepaper and try to pinch off the lingering loaf (which required careful precision to avoid smearing the creature all over my rear, especially since I had no way of seeing what I was doing) or just go for broke, start wiping, and hope that I could remove all the leftover fecal matter before the toilet paper reached its Can't-Be-Flushed threshold. I was contemplating this problem, when I had what seemed at the time to be a bright idea. \"Hey, this is my butt and my butt-hair, right? So why don't I just eliminate all the hair, and then my grogans will flow out like beer from a keg!\" I said to myself. It is a statement that will go down in history with a lot of other regretted statements. \"How many Indians could there be?\" said by General Custer. \"Looks like a good day for a drive!\" by JFK. \"There! America On-line now has complete Usenet access!\" by some idiot system tech. Such was my anal shaving idea.\n> \n> I performed the operation that night, with a cheap disposable razor and a towel to sit on. Starting from the bottom, and shaving from the crack to the cheeks, I began the arduous process of ridding my ass of hair. Occasionally, I would have to clean the razor of accumulated hair, which I did by wiping it on the towel. Slowly, my twin mounds and the between-ravine began to resemble the hairless cheeks of a newborn babe. Finally, I wiped the razor one last time, and surveyed my work. The towel was covered with a pile of hair. My ass was smooth as ivory. I smiled, satisfied, thinking my troubles were over.\n> \n> Little did I know. I now have a great respect for anal-hair. Like everything in this world God created, it has its mighty purpose in existence. It was only after I had removed it that I started to learn how much I had been taking it for granted. For one, it provides friction. I learned this the next day, when I walked out into the sun heading for class. After climbing two flights of stairs and starting to sweat, I started to notice something unpleasant. The sweat was accumulating in my crack, and was causing the unpleasant sensation of my two asscheeks sliding past each other with every step. I thought about going to the bathroom and wiping it off, but had to get to class. Eventually, I\n> thought, it would dry. Unfortunately, it did dry, but only after mingling with the microscopic poop -molecules lingering around my brown starfish. When I stood up after class, my cheeks were stuck together with a slimy sticky poop/sweat combination. As I made my way back to my dorm, it started to itch. God-DAMN, did it itch! Felt like a swarm of ants was making its way up and down my crack. Fighting to keep from jamming my hand down there\n> and scratching away, I rushed back to the dorm. Unfortunately, this exertion caused me to sweat, and when I finally\n> reached my room, my cheeks were sliding back and forth against each other like a pair of horny cane-toads. I quickly dropped my pants, and attempted to dry my ass off by sticking it in front of a fan and spreading my cheeks.\n> \n> As I pulled the two mounds of flesh apart, a horrible stench burst free and filled the room. Every dog within a 4 block radius started to howl. I had it worst of all, as the ripe aroma of festering poop/sweat went into the fan and blew back into my face. I fought to keep from heaving. And as I sat there, fighting vomit, my ass cheeks spread and dripping, with the concentrated aroma of my body odor mixed with the tangy smell of my own poop blowing right into my face, I had only one thought: \"It will be like this until the hair grows back. Weeks.\" Later on, trying to deal as best I could, wiping my ass at every opportunity, I discovered another wonderful use for ass-hair - ventilation. I attempted to launch a fart, only to have it get stuck between my asscheeks.\n> \n> Apparently, with no hair, the two pink twins can get vacuum sealed together, and the result was a frustrating fart that slid up and down between my cheeks like a lost gerbil. As if that wasn't\n> enough, I am now enduring further torture. As anyone who has ever shaved anything knows, when hair is first growing in, it comes in as stubble. Imagine your ass having the texture of a brillo pad.\n> \n> Well, that is what I am dealing with now. It is a hellish torture, and there are many times when I just look out the window and contemplate why I shouldn't just jump out and get it all over with in one fleshy splat, rather than endure this constant agony.\n> \n> Friends-DON'T SHAVE YOUR ARSE-HAIR!",

This is a few months old but I feel like I have to get it out of my head.\n\nSo I know most people masturbate in the shower or in the toilet but I've always done it in bed. I am living with my parents so I guess I just like the privacy of my room. Then - and this is what I now realize is me being a fucking weirdo - when it was time I would just pull up the blanket, roll over to the side a bit and cum onto the wall/below the bed. I never really thought much of it and it never smelled bad so I just kept doing it because it was easy... Nobody noticed and people seldom visited my room anyway.\n\nAfter some years of doing this I recently reached a few difficult points in my life and this exacerbated my masturbation habits. I used to only masturbate like once a week or so (maybe that's why it didn't smell?) but for a couple of weeks I started doing it every day, sometimes a few times a day. This usually wouldn't be anything out of the ordinary for a teenager but since I was always ejaculating on my wall/bed I began to get a bad cockroach infestation there. \n\nI didn't notice at first and since I've never had cockroaches before I didn't really know what they were but eventually I read up on the internet that cockroaches like to live in dark, moist places in the house and that made sense... At first I felt really disgusted. I wanted to exterminate them but I definitely didn't want my parents to find out what happened, so I tried to kill them by flicking them into a bowl of water and watching them drown. But then I felt really bad.\n\n\n\nI don't know why but it felt like murder. I didn't really dislike the cockroaches. I had never even seen cockroaches before and they were kind of interesting. So I decided to stop killing them and kind of just let them be for like a week (at this point I finally began masturbating in the shower). I know this sounds really weird but I kind of began thinking of them as my children. It started out as a joke-thought but then it got more serious. Like, they were literally borne out of my sperm... so in my mind it made sense that they were my offspring in a way. I actually want kids when I grow up. And this was kind of like that - I used to bring them food and stuff from the kitchen and play with them by moving them around the room or letting them crawl on me and I just got really emotionally attached to them for a while even though they were obviously just insects.\n\n\n\nThen my parents found out. I think my dad saw one in the kitchen and immediately freaked out and called the exterminator the same day while I was at school. \n\n\n\nSo we had to move out for about a week to an Airbnb and I was really depressed the entire time but I couldn't tell them why. They thought I just didn't like the Airbnb.\n\nTL;DR I jerked off onto the wall and got a cockroach infestation",

        "selftext": "Found out today this humorous chain of events - well humorous depending on where you are in the chain.\n\nI saw a month or so ago that someone bought a box of ferrero rocher chocolate and wrapped Brussel sprouts in the wrappers so I did this to my daughter. I unwrapped each piece and carefully wrapped a Brussel sprout in each wrapper and returned it to the box. Then I sent the gift and waited.\n\nChristmas morning we talked and she thanked me for the candy. I asked her if she enjoyed them and she said yes - I knew she hadn't opened the gift yet, but why lie? I then realized that she probably re-gifted them. Then I asked again and she admitted that she had too much candy and wanted to get rid of some of it and her boss loves ferrero rocher. So I told her what I did.\n\nShe was amused but mad - mad at herself for regifting something I gave her as we are always doing stuff like that. It gets better.\n\nShe called her boss on Christmas day to tell her and her boss was like, \"Oh shit!\" She had re-gifted them to a client she was trying to keep after they'd had a heated exchange. The client is overweight and by the time my daughter's boss was able to call her it was too late. She wouldn't come to the phone. She was convinced that the wrapped vegetables was a slight and a message.\n\nAs far as I know she lost the client but isn't mad at my daughter.\n\nEDIT: Glad this post amused so many people. Here are a few notes addressing the comments.\n\n* It wasn't a giant box of candy, it was a 5 piece box. \n* I ate the candy as I wrapped the sprouts. No chocolate was harmed as a result of this prank.\n* The candy was one of many gifts and stocking stuffers we brought over. It wasn't like a $200 box of chocolate was re-gifted. \n* I wrapped the sprouts on the 23rd and gave them to my daughter that afternoon. She took them as an afterthought to a party at her boss' house to add to a gift box she gave  to her boss.\n* Her boss dropped them at the clients house on the 24th. \n* My family all agreed a few years ago to stop giving each other candy at holidays as we are all always trying to lose weight. \n* My opinion on regifting. It's actually a great thing if thought is applied. When it comes to gift giving I believe that it is the thought that counts. If I give a gift you can appreciate the thought and still share the gift with someone else. Whatever. To each is own. Thanks everyone :)\n\nTL;DR I gave a gag gift that was re-gifted until it ruined someone's Christmas.",

            ">I knew she hadn't opened the gift yet, but why lie?\n\nThere is nothing worse than getting caught in a lie and I almost did that and would have massively embarrassed myself.\n\nI was sitting in my cube one day and a co-worker gives me a scratch-off ticket as a gift and he went back to his cube.  I scratched it and it was a 10k winner and I had a mini-heart attack.  \n\nDo I split it?  Do I even say it was a winner?  If I split it, will people think I should just give the whole thing over?  Do I even have to split it at all?  Will the entire office expect me to take them to a fancy lunch and drop a couple grand?  Everyone in the office will have an opinion and some will turn hostile and jealous.  This is about to be a can of worms.\n\nSo he comes back over and asks, \"Did you scratch it?\"  And I said, \"not yet\" and he walks away again.  I need time to think.\n\nI'm still contemplating what to do.  While doing that, I decide to turn it over and read how to claim it.  As you probably have guessed by now, it was a gag ticket.  Godfuckingdammitsomuch.\n\nI can't even imagine what stink it would have caused if I had said it wasn't a winner, everyone would have called me out for being horrible, which wouldn't be wrong.  I would have had a mark on me for the rest of my career there.\n\nI would rather hand over 5 grand not to have that stigma, I'm so glad I kept my mouth shut.

I was working on a 2013 grand caravan to replace a timing chain guide and everything was going good until I tried to start it. Well, the timing was slightly off and I didn't know the sensors for the valve train had to be reset. Well, I got it put together and tried starting. No start. Gave it back to the customer on a tow truck and told them to take it to a different shop. Bent valves, off time and messed up cylinder heads is the damage. I didn't take any payment and I told them that I would cover the cost of any repairs as any honest mechanic should, but I didn't realize the extent of the damage and now I have to make it right and pay $4,138 to get it fixed properly from a different shop. Thankfully the customer was civil about it and will hopefully not put any bad on my name, but yeah, I messed up and now I have to pay for my mess up. \n\nTL;DR TIFU And took on a job I couldn't do so now I have to pay someone else to fix my mess up.",

No mechanic worth their salt would have just done that job without having clear instructions. Even seasoned veterans would be using a guide. Changing timing parts is actually quite easy.

My first brake job on a BMW (like 2012ish) I had no idea it had a brake pad sensor..... I broke all 4. Stupid things that look like nothing more than a small abs sensor cost me almost $1000. That's a lesson 18yr old me never forgot. I started that thing after I was done and that dash lit up like a Christmas tree. For the next year they called me lite bright and I got called to \"consult\" on every non Ford brake job. \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01\n\nThe shop I worked in had 20+ mechanics and I seen people with 10-30 years experience make catastrophic mistakes. It happens. It's all in how you deal with it and you did good. Anyone on here saying anything else or putting you down has no idea what it's like to work on cars now a days.\n\nGoogle is your friend in this day and age. You can find it all. Somebody mentioned Alldata and Mitchell is another and Snapon has a scan tool that comes with software like that also {but it's Snapon expensive). Good luck brother.",

            "Former mechanic here. I used to do work on the side. I stopped for the most part because of stuff like this. I had to do a brake line and the customer told me he just noticed it was leaking and didn't drive it since. He lied. I repaired both brake lines to the rear and no amount of bleeding would give me a good brake pedal. Apparently he drove it with a leaky line for a bit and got air in the whole system, including the ABS module. I tried to bleed it in the driveway for three days using one floor jack and jack stand. In the end I had to send it down to the shop. It made me realise how woefully under prepared I was for anything requiring a fully capable diagnostic computer. I now usually don't do that kind of stuff for anyone other than family. It's too much risk and can take too much time and hassle since the work is usually a 45 min one way drive from my toolbox. I feel ya, friend. Good on you for making your client whole. Regardless of what they say you know you did your best to keep them happy and make the best of a shitty situation. Thank you for not giving mechanics a bad rap. Good luck on the next job hope it goes much better :)",

When there is doubt or lack of experience in any issue with a vehicle always call for help to other shops you may do business with. Either to get information or to see if you can sublet the job. This way, if you sublet it, you still make a few bucks while keeping your reputation AND you don't have to do the work. Shit happens, we fucked up timing on a Sante fe and had to put an engine in the customers car, ircc there was an issue with the tensioner.  Shit happens, but it is preventable.

But absolutely kudos to you for doing all you can to make it right.     \n\n\nThat said, this should be a wake up call to engage in continuing education, and surround yourself with knowledgeable people.    Every profession, especially those where technology changes rapidly, as do design iterations, should have people who engage with continuing education.   \n\n\nIf you've been doing this for a while, that could actually work against you.   As a mechanic, continuing education could mean workshops, internet research, or even just working with someone younger and more ''inexperienced'' that is a RECENT grad of a Mechanic certification program.   \n\n\nThere are professions now where your 10-20+ years of experience don't mean anything anymore, because technology and design has moved well beyond what you were taught.    \n\n\nEither way, you should never be afraid to ask when you don't know, or are working on a vehicle you have never seen before, or a problem you haven't tackled before.

It had lost the timing belt on the highway, I bought it for $500, and had already had the heads repaired. So I spent a weekend putting it back together and drove that for the next 3 years. \n\nUnfortunately the Legacy never drove again, but after it went to the junk yard it lived a brief life as a stolen car.

            "I commiserate, but you aren't the first. My ex was the PA for a guy who ran a chain of dealerships in the UK. She used to come home and tell me the shit she heard about that day. Her boss played a lot of golf and left her to decide how to deal with most of it. I had two friends who worked at a local Nissan dealer as a service writer and the other at a local GM dealer. Whatever I told them had happened, they'd done it themselves or one of their friends had. One of my wife company's mechanics took a brand new very hard to get high performance car, it arrived with them needing a brake recall before it could be handed over, rerouting a sensor wire of something. It was a cold day so they had the shop doors closed. Our hero completed the brake work, which had included dismounting the brake calipers. He fired up the beast and accelerated towards the door while hitting the opener. He hit the brakes and his foot went to the floor. He hadn't pumped them up. He put the car straight through the almost closed door. Right through the heavy bar across the bottom. Door and car were ruined. They found another one at another local dealer and begged them for it, eventually cut a deal involving selling something below cost to them and finding them a replacement which could be there in a week. Customer turned up the next day and the car new new car was ready. Behind the scenes they lost a bunch of money on the repairs, then selling the 'used' car after running it as a demo for a while. When I'd finished telling the lads they had an array of similar stories. Dropped cars off lifts, driven into pits, crashed on road tests, grabbed the wrong gear (only disabled people drive automatics in the UK) and blown apart a bell housing, or trashed an engine. So what I learned no matter how bad you think you fucked up, someone else already did it.",

Dealership did they'd take a look and make sure nothing else was damaged once it was back in their shop. Come to find out, the tensioner broke. No biggie, fixed and back on the road. Then a few days later, things were running really rough so I had them look again. There was suddenly a hole in my transmission. Their guess was a bolt got lost from something and lodged in there. They said it was most likely from having someone work on my engine and asked who had worked on it recently. I told them they were and the last shop that had was month prior for an oil change. Blank stares and then some spiel about there's no way it came from their work etc and I had to pay for Partially new transmission, which was about $3,000 and due to covid, I was only getting about $200 a month.\n\nI hope you benefit from this long term, because I have yet to go back or even recommend anyone go back there.

Some time in this whole play activity, she asked if I could stick my penis in a bottle.\n\nNow, this was a weird thing to me but I thought maybe it was one of her fetishes so I went ahead and did it. It didn't fit in the first two bottles we could find (yes I know...humblebrag) but the third one had a wide enough neck/opening for at least most of it to go in rather snuggly. She started laughing and I started forcing a fake laugh and then asked her, how long she wants me to do it for. She never replied and then she just started playing with the part of my twig and berries that was not in the bottle...causing me to get hard. She knew what she was doing was causing this but would not stop. I begged her to stop but she would not stop and continued to stroke me. Now my dick was straining and I started to get really worried. Then she started screaming...blood was coming out of my dick.\n\nLong story short, she started crying and finally stopped. The bleeding continued for a few minutes (only small amounts).

            "This sucks man, I'm sorry it happened to you. I'll relate this to my Not So Fun Penile Damage Story.\n\nSo, I was pretty young, around 10. I LOVED off road dirt biking, and I had just learned how to do jumps. My bike was too small for me, so I went off my first jump, feet came off the pegs and I landed riiight on the back wheel. \n\nBest part?\n\nI was still holding on to the handlebars and the throttle. Since I was basically riding the back wheel, I was hanging on the throttle with all my weight.  Went for a few meters and hit a fence. In the end, I wasn't physically sitting on my cock n balls, but the perinium (I think that's what it's called) basically between my balls and ass. What happened was it hurt to pee, I peed a bit of blood, and had some bruising. However! It went away! Cured right?\n\nWrong. Very wrong. What had happened was I broke my urethra in 2 places, but it healed itself. For maybe half a year I was good. \n\nThen it started getting hard to pee, it hurt too. It progressively got worse and I went to the doctors. Had to have surgery. \n\nBasically what happened was after it broke, it healed itself. Inside the urethra, there was scar tissue. Since I hit puberty, shit started growing, the scar tissue did not. It started progressively constricting urine flow. The surgery entailed me going under, them shooting lubricant up my dick, shoving a camera with a laser on it up my urethra it and lazering the scar tissue off. Fun.\n\nThe worst part was peeing afterwards. ( especially how an entire wing of nurses clapped when I took a piss... all of them seeing my naked ass) For the next 6 days I was peeing out blood, lumps of lubricant, and air that got into my bladder (laughed when I saw my dick fart. Cried when it hurt like FUCK) it was the worst pain I've ever felt. Broken bones, welding burns, dislocations, deep cuts ect were still better than this. Go to the doctors. Seriously. Go see a doctor and get the problem dealt with right away. Good luck man. PS: Pee standing up, not sitting down. Hurts much less.\n\nTLDR: was around 10, rode the back wheel of a motorcycle, hurt to pee, ignored it, pain and shit came back 6 months later, went to the doctors, turns out I broke my urethra in 2 places, scar tissue in my urethra was closing up, needed surgery to get the scar tissue lazered off, did the surgery, peed in the hospital bathroom, nurses opened door and clapped (it's a good story), bled blood, chunks of lubricant and scar tissue for the next 6 days, dick also farted.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Any one who is blaming you at all is ass backward and supports sexual assault, which you were sexually assaulted given your description of events. The onus is not on you to walk away or overpower her. Once consent was withdrawn, that's that.

It's likely far from the first situation she's treated you so poorly.\nI hope, if it is, and you choose to continue the relationship, she does a 180 and truly understands the consequences (not just physical ones) of her actions and respects you in all ways from here on out. \nYou didn't fuck up today, she did.

        "selftext": "I'm in marketing, particularly in the business of slogans. So, a few days ago I was writing the slogan for this local wine-and-pizza restaurant and they told me they had a problem: They had an uncharacteristically shitty location.\n\nThere's no way people were just finding this place on their own. It was buried on the backside of a fucking strip mall on a desolate road 10 miles outside of town. So, of course with a location like that, foot traffic was suffering and the business as a whole was failing.\n\nLast night, I went there to get some food... for research, ya know... Anyway, I was surprised at the atmosphere and the quality of the meal. The pizza was really good. The beer selection was varied. They had a little play area where parents could drink and watch their kids play in a pretty fancy jungle gym. Pretty good stuff. Even if I wasn't writing for them, I would've given them 5 stars on Yelp, is what I mean.\n\nWhen I was driving home it dawned on me... the way to get this place on the map (literally) was to make it feel like a destination unto itself.\n\nI wrote a lot of garbage for a while (\"Where Wine Country Is Next Door!\"), but I was determined to get something usable. \n\nFinally, it hit me: \"Go Somewhere.\" It had nearly everything I wanted... a sense of agency and urgency, a subtle association with class and elegance, the claim that this place was, indeed, somewhere to be.\n\nBut, still, it wasn't quite there. It lacked the feel I wanted, felt a little too abstract. Customers didn't need to just go *somewhere,* but rather a particular direction. They needed to be pointed.\n\nAfter another hour or so, I had it.\n\nEventually, the slogan I pitched these poor people was this:\n\n\"Go Somewhere Else\"\n\nWhich, I believe the corporate equivalent of is like \"Get the fuck out of my face.\"\n\nThey haven't emailed me back.\n\nTL;DR: Today I fucked up by not thinking of the whole context of a slogan I wrote and I'm pretty sure I definitely lost a client because of it.",

A slogan is the last thing they need.\n\nThey need to (1) move to a better location or (2) spend a ton of money and effort on signage, promotion, and advertising to clearly identify how to find them, especially for drive-by customers.

He had just retired and we were all really sad that he wasn\u2019t going to be able to enjoy retirement with his wife (he remarried after my grandma). He was a goofy guy who wore pants with embroidered ducks on them and always had a magic trick to show everyone when we would visit. During his last day alive, my mother, sister and myself came over to support his wife. There were also neighbors coming in and out of the house saying their goodbyes and just consoling each other. When my grandfather passed away, we were all in the room with him and told him we loved him and that it was okay to let go.\n\nAfter we left the room to give his wife some time alone, my sister, my mom and I went downstairs to join the neighbors at the dining room table. This table was able to seat about 8 people and it was full so I was standing next to my mom at the head of the table. People had brought food to snack on and someone brought a cheese plate. I did not notice this cheese plate, so I started to comment about how stinky the room was to my mom and sister. Eventually I said the words \u201cit smells like a dead body\u201d OUT LOUD in front of everyone. The room was silent except for my mom and sister\u2019s attempts to conceal their laughter. I turned beet red and added \u201cerm...dead cat\u201d to the sentence and then abruptly left to use the bathroom and reassess my life. I know my grandpa would\u2019ve laughed if he heard it so that makes me feel better, but I can never look any of those neighbors in the face without remember that moment \ud83d\ude43.\n\nTL:DR While standing in a house that had my recently deceased grandfather upstairs, I said \u201cit smells like a dead body...erm dead cat\u201d because someone brought a stinky cheese plate.\n\n[My Poppop at art school in the 50s](https://imgur.com/a/DDg9vLV)",

            "When I was in my 30's, a childhood friend of mine died unexpectedly. This guy was the stereotypical class clown that made everyone laugh. He happened to also be a physically large person. While alive, he spent a lot of his time catching trout on a local river. After he died, his family thought it would be appropriate to have him cremated and then spread his ashes on his favorite river.\n\nSo, all of the decedent's family and friends are gathered on the river bank, as the minister is conducting the funeral. Myself and my group of jackass friends are standing together and paying our respects. It's a beautiful day with perfect weather. The river water is crystal clear and flowing at a nice pace. \n\nThe moment arrives where the minister is to open the urn and dump the contents into the beautiful flowing river. The ashes are to become one with the water and carried to the four corners of the earth. My friend is to travel to places in death that he never did in life. A fitting celebration to the life of a beautiful soul.\n\nAs the minister tilts the urn, the ashes come spilling out. They hit the water and sink. As he continues to pour, the ashes start piling up at the bottom of the river. It starts as small pile and grows to a larger mound. There was no beautiful cloud in the water. There was no becoming one with the river. There was just a small hill of cremated human remains in the bottom of a river. \n\nWitnessing these events, one of the jackass friends says too loudly, \"damn, even his ashes are heavy.\" Our little degenerate group busts out laughing in the middle of the funeral, on the banks of that crystal clear river. I started laughing even harder when it occurred to me how much my friend would have enjoyed that stupid comment.\n\nSometimes it takes laughter to get through the tough times. It sounds like your grandfather was a special person.",
            "God, I love funny stories like this. It reminds me of my grandfather.\n\nMy grandfather passed at age 90. The were putting him on hospice and were giving him 1-2 months, but said he was perfectly stable and not going anywhere that day. Well he was convinced he was going that very minute. He made my mom and I hold his hands while he'd try to say some picture perfect last words, take a deep breathe, and then sit there in silence. After a minute of that, he'd do it again, and switch the words up a little bit. But he just wouldn't die....it was like trying to watch Michael Scott sink a behind the back shot. My dad, who was leaning against the wall during all of this, shifted his weight and accidently hit the light switch, turning the reading light on right over my grandfather. You could here the excitement in his voice \"There it is, I see the light, it's finally time\"....while we have to hold back the weirdest mix of grief and comedy tears I've ever had in my life.",
            "Similar experience. Had a college class held on the main floor of a dorm, and over the course of a week the smell in the hallway continuously got worse. This led to our professor finally leading a rousing game of \u201cname that smell\u201d, with used kitty litter slightly beating out burned ramen. They found a body in the basement of the dorm that evening. No one mentioned the game again.",

            "Humour is one of the best coping mechanisms. I remember when my dad died, we had him cremated. We had a funeral service to bury his ashes in the family plot. When we were standing in the funeral home, I was carrying the urn and I turned to my sister and said \"well, I guess he's finally lost some weight\"The whole room erupted with laughter and you could feel the tension lifting.

            "This was fantastic lol. \n\nWhen I was away at college my grandfather that I was close to passed in the middle of a very tough semester class-wise. I had an organic chemistry lab later that afternoon and it was going to be more of a pain in the ass to skip and make up the lab later than to just go and muddle through it. My flight back home was scheduled the next morning so I needed to do my lab write-up and hand it in that night before leaving so I went straight to the library and spent like 6 hours alternating between silently crying, running to the bathroom to sob, and trying to crank out a four page report. I fiiiiinally finished and was on my way to the printers to get my report and a mutual acquaintance saw me and came up to say hi when I turned around and she saw my face. Her first instinct was to loudly say \"oh wow, who died?\" in a joking manner so I stared her in the face and equally loudly said \"MY GRANDFATHER\". Her face was amaaaaaaaaazing, including the horror-struck students within earshot. The whole thing was so funny that I started laugh-sobbing while she awkwardly tried to comfort someone she barely knew in passing. The entire time all I could think of was that my grandfather would've shat himself laughing at the whole ordeal.",
            "Sounds like you have a good family, that sounds like actually a happy funny moment amongst a sad day, nice job....my grandmother had a big problem with punctuality. She used to joke that she was going to be late to her own funeral. Well...on the way from the church to the cemetery, the hearse broke down. And they had to load her into a different hearse. She was late to her own funeral...this made celebrating her life even better, as she had a great sense of humor, and she got the last laugh.",
            "I have a notoriously inappropriate sense of humour. When my mum was dying (literally taking her last breaths) I was talking to her to try and make her passing easier and in amongst all the generic waffle I told her I would remind my dad to put on clean underwear. My dad, who was standing on the other side of her bed, stopped crying long enough to gape at me, while the nurse behind me made a choking sound. She later told me she had never almost laughed at a deathbed in quite a few years of standing witness. \n\nLater that day, I booked the funeral director and picked out the funeral plan. It was cheaper to buy a double plot than 2 singles so I said we'd take the double, at which point my dad walked into the room and asked why we were getting a double. I told him it was so he'd know where he was going for once (his sense of direction is basically non-existent). The woman on the other end of the phone went silent but luckily my dad thought it was hilarious and burst out laughing. \n\nI also wrote and delivered my mum's eulogy. It was the hardest thing I have ever written and took me so long to get done that I only finished it the night before the funeral. When people asked how it was going I told them I was debating trying out some stand-up on the captive audience of the congregation. It turned out not to be necessary but I did take quotes from Harry Potter and Winnie-the-pooh.",

            "I\u2019ve heard some weird and funny things said at funerals but that is probably the most \u201cfoot in mouth\u201d moment I\u2019ve heard.  \n\nSpeaking of funerals, I will never forget the time at a funeral when and old lady leaned over the grave to toss flowers and fell into the grave and the cemetery workers had to jump in the grave and stand on the coffin and get the old lady out.  It was the funniest shit I\u2019ve ever seen but at the time it wasn\u2019t so funny because obviously the old lady took a bad tumble but it was just so farcical watching the guys get muddy boot prints all over this nice shiny coffin and the old lady screaming \u201chelp! help!\u201d from the grave.  \n\nAnother one I saw was when lowering a coffin after a very heavy rainstorm, the funeral worker slipped and the strap using to lower the coffin snapped and then the side of the grave collapsed and the coffin slid into the grave headfirst and came to a stop upside down with the headstone of the adjoining grave came crashing down and wedged into the grave.  The funeral was cancelled and as far as I know the family sued the funeral home.  Not exactly the most dignified send off for Granny but I bet they never forget her funeral.",

Her middle child was 3 or 4 at the time, and my youngest about 10. They were being silly and as we were trying to gather the kids to make it to the cemetery, I see my great nephew sprawled on the floor \u201cdramatically\u201d dead with my daughter over him, checking his pulse at his neck and calls over \u201cwe got another fresh body for the coroner, tag and bag em\u201d (she has overheard work stories from the hubby and myself working in emergency services/legal avenues, and I\u2019m sure she picked it up then) \n\nYou could imagine my embarrassment lol \n\nWhat\u2019s even more silly, after the cemetery we were saying bye to my family, and my hubby says bye to my nieces hubby and claps him on the shoulder while shaking the other hand and he says, \u201csee ya guys at the next one\u201d  -_- idiot lol\n\nHe didn\u2019t mean it that way, but it was eerily strange to have been at another one of my family members funerals a year before then.

            "Lmao this reminded me of when my Grandpa passed. We took him in because he was going through some very heavy chemo and radiation, and we knew he didn't have much longer. We actually came to find out it was terminal, but we can't seem to determine why he didn't tell us. Anyways, he had days where his memory just wasn't there, but he did have a few good days. One of these days, I woke up, and I saw him in the living room. He looked confused, so I assumed he was off.\n\nHe looked at me and said \"Who the fuck are you?\" And I gave him a quick reminder, but midway through he just started smirking at me and said \"I know who you are dumbass, I'm fucking with you.\" That was one of the few moments I got to really bond with him, and I cherish that moment. (He wasn't being rude, that's just our family's sense of humor.)\n\nUnfortunately, he passed a week later, and I wish I would have gotten more moments like that with him. Ironically, he actually passed at age 69. We all thought that there was no better age that described him.\n\nEdit: Needed to add something :)",

My mom decided to let me see him at the funeral, and she says I just stood and stared silently for a few minutes. \n\nAt the wake, I was sitting on my grandmothers lap (it was her fathers funeral) and I could smell her makeup.

It's quite hard to describe in English, but she was essentially pronouncing the first 'e' in a different way which resembled another accent from a region nearby.

On one instance, I had briefed the chaplain that once I had given him the signal, he could proceed with the ceremony (in this case, the deadly departed was an admiral!) As we were descending on-station, the pilot sent me to the back of the plane to let the chaplain know we were still depressurizing.

            "Back during the Vietnam War I was in high school, and the possibility of being drafted and sent to fight in Vietnam weighed heavily on everybody's mind.  I was a member of the Unitarian-Universalist church (Thomas Jefferson was a Universalist, for context) and my church had come out as being opposed to the war, and strongly supported anyone who declared as a conscientious objector.  After consulting with my pastor, I filed a declaration of conscientious objection to service in the armed forces with my local draft board, and was granted CO status.  As part of my CO service, I had to go get a job that met the requirements of \"public service,\" for 24 consecutive months (the same length of service for military draftees) and I went to work as an orderly and truck driver in a rehabilitation hospital for people who were paralyzed.  The draft board approved it.\n\nI worked on a unit of 14 paralyzed men and 14 teenaged boys over the age of 16.  One ward of the unit was the boys, and the other ward was adult men, many of whom had been injured in car wrecks or industrial accidents.  (The boys were mostly injured in car and motorcycle wrecks.)  My duties included a lot of feeding patients, emptying urine bags, cleaning BM off of people, bed baths, changing sheets and transfers of people into and out of wheelchairs.  It was hard work.\n\nOne of our male patients was a very large truck driver.  He was a DNR and had passed away on the unit of a heart attack (DNR stands for Do Not Resuscitate-- if the patient goes into cardiac arrest the staff is to do nothing.  It is a choice made by the patient, not by the hospital.)\n\nAnyway, this truck driver had passed away, and it was our job to prepare him for transport to a funeral home right at shift change at 0630.  The body was awaiting transfer in a very small, cramped room that was normally used for urinary cystography procedures.  It was not on the unit where other patients could see or hear.\n\nIn order to move him from a hospital gurney to a funeral home stretcher, we had to \"log roll\" him using whatever available staff could be shanghai'ed for the task.  There were three men and two (very reluctant) women for the transfer team.  The largest and strongest of us three men took the shoulders and chest.  I took the hips and lower torso, the two women took the legs and feet, and the third guy, a very nervous, nearly histrionic and somewhat effeminate black gay guy, took the head.  When we \"rolled the body up\" for the transfer he was so heavy that the guy lifting the shoulders and I had to really exercise maximum effort, and doing so unexpectedly depressed the body's diaphragm, causing the body to expel a loud sigh.  It startled the guy holding the head, who dropped his part, threw up his hands and started screaming, \"He's *alive,* he's *alive!*\" which freaked out the two women, who also started screaming and who nearly dropped the body's feet and legs, causing the guy on the shoulders and I to nearly drop the entire body.  It came down on the funeral stretcher (Thank God) with a resounding crash, nearly tipping the stretcher over, which caused even more pandemonium.\n\nFinally, after everybody calmed down, the guy on the shoulders and I had to help load this heavy-ass body (covered with a sheet and prepared for transport) into the funeral transport station wagon.  I was *so* glad that no other patients witnessed this debacle.  It was caused by the fear of dead bodies in the three people who freaked out, something for which I was totally unprepared--they were *adults,* and were *hospital employees.*  (It was like, \"What the fuck do you think we *do* here?  We deal with death and tragedy, *duh.*\")\n\n(Edit: I completed my CO duty at age 21, and continued to resist the Vietnam War for a while, but I began to have serious misgivings about my having become a conscientious objector.  There were two main considerations--first, I came to the uneasy and startling realization that I was not truly a religious pacifist, (which is a prerequisite for CO status.)  Secondly, I began to have serious feelings of guilt, and shame about having avoided being drafted, because the theoretical upshot of that was that somebody else had been sent to Vietnam in my place.  At age 26 (very old to be a soldier), I renounced my former sincerely-held religious beliefs about military service and volunteered for the Marine Corps.  I requested \"infantry,\"  (I was determined to serve as a rifleman--an \"MOS 0311\" because I considered service in a rifle company to be the most likely to be hazardous) but was sent to small arms repair school despite my request.  (Marines pretty much \"go where they're sent.\")  I served four years in an infantry battalion as an armorer (MOS 2111,) but saw no combat.  I was a *peacetime Marine.*  Still, service in the Marine Corps is pretty hazardous, even in peacetime.  Marines \"train like they fight\", and doing so with live ammunition is definitely a little scary.  I'm glad I enlisted, but I would not volunteer for military service again unless our country was in desperate danger.  Essentially, I fulfilled my military obligation *twice,* once as a CO and once as a Marine.)",

But I am so damn CLUELESS that I ask them that I can\u2019t believe they haven\u2019t seen the movie because it\u2019s great. 2 hours later it hits me, and I\u2019ve been mortified ever since, luckily we broke up and the chance of me seeing them again is pretty slim.",

Friends and family came to the bedside to say their good byes and the pastor even gave him the Lutheran last rites.\n\nAfter everyone left Ole alone in his bed he smelled the most delicious thing; fresh baked bars! They smelled so good that  Ole roused a bit, got out of bed and actually shuffled his way down to the kitchen where he saw a platter piled high with amazing chocolate chip bars hot out of the oven. He reached a feeble old hand towards the plate to take hold of one of the delights when Lena slapped his wrist.\n\n\"Ole! Dose are for da funeral!\"",

            "My brother was killed in a car wreck almost 2 years ago. As Mum and Dad were organising what he would wear in his casket, they were wondering if his suit they provided to the funeral home would still fit ( he was a big guy). Mum said they would just make it fit by cutting the back of the suit open. Dad said \"they couldn't do that, imagine him turning up at the pearly gates with the back of his suit open\" and Mum replied \"well I'm sure your mother will fix it for him when he gets there\" (my grandmother had passed years earlier and was an amazing seamstress). \nI had to go outside for a smoke and a giggle at that one.\n\n As it ended up, the suit fit, so he was cremated in his suit, wearing fluffy bear claw slippers, a packet of cigarettes in his suit pocket, but no lighter or matches. He would have loved his outfit, and been cursing me for buying him smokes, but nothing to light them with. That image still makes me smile everytime I think of it.",

My sister and I turned to each and said, way too loudly and in unison: Well, I guess his ass is covered!  We both got the giggles and snickered throughout the rest of the service. \n\nAt the viewing, my Mom approached the open casket and blurted out \u201cOh my god!

        "selftext": "This happened a couple of years ago, but is by far the biggest fuck-up I've ever committed.\n\nI was working in a cinema at the time and Avengers: Endgame was out. I was working the day shift in the week so it was relatively quiet. A woman came out of her Avengers screening complaining about the sound balance. I went to check in the screen and the movie sounded normal. So I went to check the sound level on the speakers and they were all set to the normal levels.\n\nI came back and explained to the woman that all of our levels were normal. She insisted that they weren't. Now, I'm somewhat of a movie buff and have noticed a trend in recent years of action films having really poor sound mixing. The dialogue is usually too quiet and the action too loud. I don't know where this trend came from, but everyone seemed to finally realise when Tenet came out and they couldn't hear a damn thing anyone was saying.\n\nSo, I said to her that that's just how Endgame sounds. That for whatever reason, the sound mixers made the dialogue too quiet and that I find it to be a really annoying stylistic choice in modern filmmaking.\n\nThe look of rage that engulfed her face cannot be described. I don't think I've ever seen someone go from 0-100 on the anger meter that fast.\n\n\"I *AM* THE SOUND MIXER!\" she said. Turns out she worked at Pinewood Studios and was the person responsible for what I had just described as bad sound design to her face.\n\nShe went on a whole tirade about how she knows more than me as I just had to stand there and take it. I still stand by my belief that the sound mixing in Endgame was not good, but I never thought I'd end up saying that to the person responsible for it.\n\nTL;DR Was working at a cinema and a customer complained about Endgame being too quiet. I told her the sound mix was bad, turns out she was one of the sound mixers for the movie.\n\nEDIT: I am talking about Pinewood Studios in London, England, not the one in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nEDIT 2: There's no need to call her a bitch, guys, I've had far more hostile customers, believe me. Maybe she was just having a bad day. I'm sure she's a nice person.\n\nEDIT 3: Please stop suggesting that I should have taken her to personally inspect the equipment. I would have been fired for breaking a myriad of rules. It was a no-win situation.\n\nEDIT 4: The cinema in question wasn't far from several major production studios and several high-profile location sites for big Hollywood movies. So the odds of me serving someone who worked on Endgame (which was partially made essentially down the road from me) are actually pretty high.\n\nEDIT 5: She might have worked at Shepperton Studios, which is next to Pinewood. I'm honestly not sure which one it was.\n\nFINAL EDIT I PROMISE: I fully acknowledge that she knows more about sound mixing than me or most of the people in this thread. However, as consumers, we have a right to voice our opinion if we don't like a product. The fact that the VAST MAJORITY of the commenters agree that action films nowadays are way too loud in some places and quiet in others shows that there is clearly a problem. You don't have to be a professional chef to know if your food tastes bad, and you don't need to be a professional sound mixer to know if a movie sounds like trash.",

            "When Warren Beatty was producing the movie \"Bonnie and Clyde\", he wanted the gunshots to be very loud. So he used a technique that he heard about from the movie \"Shane\".\n\nLater, at a screening, he noticed that the sound was not as loud as he expected in those, so he went to the projectionist. The projectionist was intentionally turning down the volume, claiming that the sound mixing had been done very poorly. The worst he had heard since Shane.\n\n[Source.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/oldmoviesaregreat.wordpress.com/2017/01/20/bonnie-and-clyde-1967/amp/)",

I thought it was me getting old, but good to know that, especially in action films, this may be part of a mixing trend.

My dad said Paul wanted the background sounds (bird sounds and stuff) too loud when they did the final mix. So when he thought the director wasn't paying attention, he slowly turned down the background track. But Paul Verhoeven would notice immediately and ask \"who put that background track softer?\" So in the end, it's the movie director who gets to decide how the movie going to sound, not the sound engineer who mixes it.",

            "I wish movies (at least for at-home consumption) allowed for personalized mixing like video games do. I absolutely loved The Mandalorian, but whenever action scenes started I would turn my volume WAY down, then when someone talked I'd have to turn it WAY up and it was just this constant volume yoyo. And I agree that action movies tend to do the same thing. In theaters I always bring headphones and use the assisted listening devices, and the balance is way better on those, and I can keep it at a non-damaging volume. Honestly those should be standard for everyone. Can't hear people eating popcorn, can't hear people talking, makes it harder for people to talk in the first place... good shit.\n\nAlso, sounds like maybe she should pay attention to the fact that how she mixed the sound doesn't work the same in theaters and act accordingly in the future. Learning experience.",

            "The job role responsible is the re-recording mixer. It's extremely unlikely they're watching the film again at your cinema. They've watched it many many times while mixing it. In a beautiful big dubbing theater. And then possibly again at the premier and maybe a cast and crew event. They've seen it enough.\n\nThe re-recording mixers on Avengers End game were all men (you can check on IMDB). I'm almost certain it was mixed in America in Disney sound studios and not at pinewood UK. \n\nA sound mixer is actually the sound person on set and not at all responsible for the mix levels.\n\nI think either she is making it up or you are. \n\nAlso properly 'lining up' a cinema for audio is something dolby professionals do. They use microphones and apply EQ and level to get the balance right, it's complicated. For every film that's mixed dolby will come in and check the space and make sure it sounds right when you finalise it with everyone. This is known as the print master. If she was the mixer, she is right and your system needs work.",
            "I worked at a movie theater for 14 years. The sound mixing in action films has always been an issue. I can't tell you how many times I went back and forth with the company technician and the customers about this topic.\n\nWe had a professional sound guy come in every quarter and news with the subwoofers, volume controls, etc. And he always yelled at me for changing the volume. \"It's at the industry standard. You should've called me instead of changing the volume.\" Then he'd screw it all up again and we would go through the same cycle.\n\nI'm so glad I am no longer in that industry, honestly. There are a lot of people in the film industry that think they are better than you, along with some customers. For the most part the customers are great. But the bad ones are usually REALLY bad",

Then I burst her bubble and told her I was one of those abused children and when they leave the home things only get worse.  Social workers make things worse in broken families and the children pay when they get involved.  \n\nNeedless to say she only does it for a paycheck who cares about the quality of the program.

It sounds different when you don't use that exact same setup. Now on a different set of speakers in a different environment the sound comes out completely different. \n\nModern blockbuster movies favor sound effects over dialog, to make the movie feel more \"real\". Micheal Bay famously complained about this when the first Transformers came out, lot's of theaters weren't loud enough. So you'll hear that anything from the theater, especially the bigger movies with any action (Marvel, DC, Disney) have hard to hear voices.\n\nI watch the same movie at home with my mid range 2 channel soundbar and now I need to turn on the closed captions to hear anything. The problem is that sound effects channels just overpower anything else and the voices come out to muddy to understand. And that's because the mixer didn't go back and create a mix for anything other than their top of the line gear.\n\nI knew someone who did digital art. She said that when she sent off something to print she would use all the fancy settings.

It could potentially be the quality of the monitors in a wide open space within a cinema. There is all that space for the sound to reverberate and bounce around and somewhere along the lines it gets lost and made unclear. If the studios didn't provide a setting in which they can test the sound in a theatre setting thats neither the engineers fault or the theatres fault, thats on the big suits my dude. But then again, I could be completely wrong. I aint saying this is for certain what happened, just simply stating maybe if its happening to a lot of films then this could possibly be the issue.",

It\u2019s like they go in and edit only for the visuals for standard release - audio at IMAX is always fantastic and clear, outside of that for the action blockbusters it\u2019s often terrible"

I\u2019m still shaking like a leaf but I\u2019m slowly starting to realize how hilarious the situation was.\n\nSo I (F18) recently began drinking cream soda. The bottles look a bit like beer bottles, but it never really dawned on me how similar they were until now.\n\nA few minutes ago I was sitting in my car at a red light. There was a half-drunk bottle of in the car, so I drank some of it while I was sitting at the light. There was a cop car in the lane next to me, but I didn\u2019t think anything of it.\n\nThe light turns green and I go, the cop instantly pulls behind me and turns on full sirens and lights. I was shocked because I\u2019d just pulled forward at a light. I was barely going 10 miles an hour, the light was green, I wasn\u2019t on my phone, I couldn\u2019t think of anything I\u2019d done wrong. But I was the only car he could be signaling to so I pulled over, and this guy gets out of his car and comes over to me as I\u2019m digging around for my license and registration. \n\nHe knocked on the window and said \u201cma\u2019am I need you to step out of the vehicle right now\u201d and I\u2019m sitting there thinking \u201cwhat the hell is going on? What did I do?\u201d but I complied because I\u2019m an anxiety ridden person and I was terrified of what I might be in trouble for. He looked at me for a moment and said \u201cMa\u2019am have you been drinking?\u201d and I said \u201cno, I\u2019m 18.\u201d He looked into my car, frowned, reached in, grabbed the bottle out of my cup holder and said \u201cOh.\u201d\n\nAfter some apologizing on his part and awkward laughter, he explained that he\u2019d seen the bottle and thought that it contained beer rather than soda. I was in shock and wasn\u2019t sure how to react so I just awkwardly laughed and said \u201coh yeah...sorry...it\u2019s soda....\u201d meanwhile I\u2019m standing there shaking because the situation seemed so so bizarre. Cop got back in his car and drove off, and I\u2019m still not sure what happened\ud83d\ude02\n\nTL;DR: I drank cream soda at a stop light, and a cop pulled me over because he thought it was beer, resulting in me being scared sh*tless because I had no idea what was going on.",

            "I got pulled over once back in the day coming back from a high school get together.  My friend had, for some reason, had a bunch of Pepsi and was feeling sick to his stomach, so he's moaning and holding his stomach in the passenger seat.\n\nMy dad was a firefighter in our small town, so all the cops knew him.  Officer Friendly was in the middle of telling me to slow down (47 in a 40) and get home safely as it was after curfew when he noticed my buddy.\n\n\"What's wrong with you, son?\"\n\n\"I drank too much.\"\n\nI felt my vision dim a little as the exquisite cringe hit me, but he then followed up with \"too much Pepsi!\"\n\nAfter a few more questions he was off the hook, as he wasn't actually cognitively impaired by his sugary overindulgence.",

Cops showed up and searched the car. First they found an empty pack of his dad's cigarettes and were very accusatory then they found a empty brown bottle of root beer again very stren and convinced they were up to no good.  Last they found their bag of rock climbing chalk and were convinced a few high schoolers had 1/2 pound of coke in a open canvas bag along with ropes, harnesses, etc. After over an hour they were let go with a warning to not be in the park after it was closed.",
            "I used to work for a beer distributor delivering, restocking, setting up displays etc. It was pretty normal for product to get knocked over/dropped or damaged in some way, so at the end of the day smelling like sweat and old beer wasn't unheard of. One day at my first account I dropped a 18 pack of bottles and it exploded all over my lower half, shoes socks and pants drenched, I clean up the mess and myself the best I could and go on about my day.\n Last account of the day I'm stocking a 24oz can of Miller lite it gets caught on some metal in the freezer and explodes all over my face and shirt. Before I started the drive home the manager of last account jokes that I better not get pulled over cause it smells like I've been on a three day bender. Well of course I had a tail light out and of course I get pulled over, rolled down the window and he was like \"whoa man how much have you had to drink, you smell like a brewery.\" 30 minutes of explaining, showing him my company ID, field sobriety test, and a breathalyzer he must of finally believed me and let me go with a warning about the tail light.",

            "One time I was driving home at like 3 AM and received a text from my ex boyfriend. I didn\u2019t want to text while driving so I pulled into an abandoned dairy queen. Maybe 5 minutes after being there just texting back-and-forth, a cop pulls in and asked me what I\u2019m doing. I was like a  deer in the headlights and just held up my phone and was like, \u201cjust texting officer so I\u2019m not driving while doing it\u201d. Thankfully he took that as good enough and didn\u2019t push it but it was nerve wracking.",
            "Same thing happened to me once. I was still in uniform, had picked up my daughter from child care. We popped in to the shopette, grabbed a bug juice for her and cream soda for me. Got in the car, opened her juice, then cracked open my cream soda. Corner of my eye I see the window go down on the car next to me. Glance over and there is a very angry looking MP glaring out his window.  \n\n\nI slowly rotated the bottle so he could see it and vowed from that point on to save my cream soda drinking for the privacy of my own home.",

Back in the early-mid 2000's my energy drink of choice was [Bawls](https://www.bawls.com/sites/default/files/Bawls%20Energy%20Line%20Up%20fixed_0.jpg). \n\nOn my way home one evening, I got stopped at a DUI checkpoint. The officer came up to me, shined his flashlight in, and saw one of those in my cupholder and 2-3 empties on the passenger side floor. \n\nLuckily for me he was pretty chill and read the bottle and let me go on my way.",
            "I spit a sunflower seed shell out of my window one time, and got pulled over for throwing a cigarette butt.\n\nThe dude took one look at all the sunflower seeds scattering the floor of my car (I had just quit smoking, and the smoking while driving was the biggest hurdle to cross) and apologized.\n\nOn the 60 going east, just after the rural road on ramp in Tempe. He was driving such an old cop car, I was really confused seeing the non led cop lights going off. I thought it was a scam at one point, because he was so young.",
            "The same thing happened to my dad with the glass bottle of root beer and me in the car as a little kid. The cop was so angry when he came to the window and then deflated and cracked up when he saw the bottle closer.",
            "I got pulled over the very first day I had my permit because the cop thought that I had been drinking, when I was just weaving because I hadn't figured out how to keep the car in between the lines. My mom was so surprised that when I started to pull over she thought I was giving up.",
            "Not alcphol related. But I remember going airsofting with friends. And the driver had his gun and his wallet in a backpack and got pulled over. Opened the backpack to get his license and we were quickly on the ground with hand on our head. The cop only saw what looked like a teenager reaching for a gun handle. Scary business.",
            "I drank half of a 'Not Your Father's' Root beer, and then remembered I had to take someone home. I live in a zero tolerance state, so I was running through in my head what I would say to a cop if they pulled me over. \n\nI got home without any trouble (not at all inebriated), but when I opened the car door, I realized I had absent-mindedly placed the beer into the cupholder of the car.",
            "Lol I have been pulled over for exactly the sam reason, a cop was beside me at a light and saw me drinking a root beer from the bottle. When he walked up he said that he saw me drinking a beer back at the light, I said \u201cyes sir I was drinking a beer, a root beer\u201d. He was very embarrassed and apologized I found it very funny.  It was great to finally not get a ticket when I got pulled over.",
            "In 1997 I was serving a mission for my church in rural Alabama, and we got some leftover pizza from a dinner appointment and we're driving back home when a cop pulled us over. Apparently a slice of pepperoni pizza looks a lot like a beer bottle in silhouette, and now some cop gets to tell the story of how he pulled someone over for drinking and not only was there no alcohol, but it was two Mormon missionaries who absolutely did not drink....",

            "Haha my family buys those IBC cream sodas and a couple of weeks ago, I grabbed one out of the fridge to drink in the car on the way to my boyfriend's house. It was only as I was drinking it in the car when I realized \"oh shit, this actually does look like beer from far away. All these other motherfuckers driving around me probably think I'm drinking and driving lol\". I'm glad I didn't get pulled over because I probably would've been anxiety ridden, too.",
            "I was riding in the passenger seat with a friend once. And we were stuck in stand-still traffic. I took a drink from a water bottle and just happened to look out at the window and at the cop in the next lane over from us. He instantly turned on his lights. He said he thought my seat belt wasn't on...even though it very clearly was on the whole time. Let us go when he realized we did absolutely nothing wrong except drink from a water bottle and make accidental eye contact.",

            "I did something similar. Had my 10 year old nephew in the car with me. We did some groceries and I bought us a couple of \"Dad's\" rootbeers. We cracked them in the car (pop offs) in the parking lot but was spotted by a passing couple who gave me a very worried and dirty look and the guy was taking out his phone to likely take a picture and call the cops until I rolled the window down and showed them it was rootbeer.

            "I'm glad I was a teen in the seventies and lived in a small town.   When we did get caught with alcohol, the cops would make us pour it all out and then tell us we were done for the night, go home, and not let him catch us out the rest of the night.   If we got mouthy, the parents were usually notified by the time we got home.   Lessons learned by being grounded by the cops and then punished by the parents if we weren't respectful.",

I was driving my mom\u2019s car and was drinking from a green glass bottle of Perrier (the larger 1 liter size, not the smaller single-serving sizes that are available now.) Cop pulled me over because he thought I was chugging from a wine bottle. I was terrified and mortified to have been pulled over, and felt so guilty that it hadn\u2019t in any way occurred to me what that would look like to someone outside the vehicle. The officer didn\u2019t even say hey, it looked suspicious, but my mistake.

Once he saw they were monsters he tried saying he received a call that two people who looked like us were swearing and throwing rocks at cars 20 minutes earlier. Well 20 minutes earlier we were on a county highway walking with now houses around us. I asked him how did the people in cars hear us going 60 down the highway. He didnt take that well either.

Even if the officer tells you they're going to get the dogs and search you anyway, never consent.

A couple of the employees were inside and I remained in the car and loaded up a corn cob pipe with some fresh tobacco (yes, actually tobacco). I started puffing on my pipe and like 2 minutes later, I have 2 police vehicles near me with one of those blocking me. As it turned out, someone else at the gas station called the police on me because they thought I was smoking weed out of a corn cob pipe. Well, the police asked me what I was smoking and I told them. The officer requested to see the pipe and tobacco so I obliged.  He smelled the pipe and immediately started laughing hysterically. His words to me were \"I'm going to keep this because you're underage, but this situation was definitely a misunderstanding.\"",

We shouldn't fear police but the fact that we do really hammers home how there is something so inherently wrong with the system of police.  OP didn't know she didn't do anything wrong and couldn't think of anything she did wrong.  As far as she knew she was innocent but she was afraid of the potential consequences of an interaction with police.\n\nFurthermore, people don't generally, after childhood, ever identify police with the slogan, \"protect and serve,\" anymore as we know and they know that just isn't true anymore.

            "Tips for the next time you're pulled over: roll down your window, kill the car, and wait with your hands on the wheel until the officer gets to your window and asks for your paperwork instead of rooting around for it. It will make the officer more comfortable because they can see your hands and know that you weren't scrambling to grab or hide anything; that may have been why he told you to step out right away. It's also a good idea to keep POI and registration where you don't have to dig for them in the future. Traffic stops suck, but hopefully this helps your next one be a bit less frightening :-)",

        "selftext": "   When I was around 12 years old and just discovering masturbation I had a hard time figuring out where I should \"unload\" it. I was too afraid to bring tissues into my room as it seemed too obvious so eventually, with my galaxy brain, I realized I could just shoot it down in the gap between my bed and wall. At this point I hadn't quite fully developed object permanence and for over a year assumed it was \"evaporating\" or something down there, out of sight out of mind... until it was time to paint. \n\n   With both of my parents in my room, unscrewing outlet covers, laying blue tape etc. I decided to move my bed and, to my horror a year's worth of cum was crusted, running down the wall. I quickly moved it back and tried to devise some reason for why we should paint another day, I decided that if I went and cooked something I could force my parents to come out and eat it while I went back in my room and painted over all the fucking CUM on my wall. Then not only would I be a good boy for cooking dinner, I would also be a good boy for having painted on my own with the added bonus of saving myself some embarrassment.\n\n  I don't remember what I cooked but I wasn't fast enough, when I came back in my mom was on her knees scrapping all the dry, flakey cum with some sort of metal tool. Before I could say anything she looked at me and said \"This is DISGUSTING. Why would you SPIT all over your wall? If you need to spit do it in the toilet, or just swallow it but you can't spit all over your walls, why would you do that?\"\n\n  I'm almost certain she knew what it was and was saving me from embarrassment, and for that she's a real trooper. I'm 21 now so it may be time to just ask.\n\nTL;DR: I used to cum on the wall next to my bed, my mom moved it and well.... cum wall\n\n\nEDIT: This got bigger than I expected so I'll add a couple things. \n\n1. There was no possible way I could brag to my friends about all the karma I've just aquired without explaining to them what a cum wall is. Naturally they now know what a cum wall is.\n\n2. I take slight comfort in the fact that unlike the shoebox and coconut this mural, as much of a work of art as it was, was never meant to be erected\n\n3. I'm seeing the links to creepily similar stories, looking at my post history you should be able to tell I'm not a troll, I don't even post a lot, just happened to be reminded of this by something a friend said last night.\n\n4.

A year went on and I thought nothing of it, until my mom somehow noticed the texture difference between the tape and the paint. She peeled away the paint and found the plugged holes, and she was LIVID. She called up the builder of the house (we had a few years of \"warranty\" where they'd come touch up paint, patch any marks in the walls, etc.) and chewed them out on the phone for \"covering up their mistake\" and said she wouldn't have been so mad if they just \"fixed it the right away instead of trying to pull a fast one by plugging the holes with tape.\" Me being the little piece of shit I was, I kept my mouth shut to avoid the wrath of my mom. Luckily the builder came out and patched, sanded and painted the wall with no questions asked, so I dodged a bullet there.",

        "selftext": "This is a story of a jail break that actually worked.... for a minute. This was years ago and I will not tell specifics and I will use fake names but this is the most epic FU I have ever heard of and it was me that FU. I was in the military but we were stateside. There was a group of fellow buddies with me. This was the night we all learned what a Jager Bomb Shot was. We had round after round after round after round. The night went by extremely fast and my friend Brian decided he would drive myself and my roommate home to our off base appointment. We left the bar and it was not long before we were pulled over. Turns out that a sedan having 3, 21 year olds leaving a bar at 2 am, near a military base is suspicious. The police officer knew we were all drunk when he got to Brian\u2019s car window and we all admitted to it. The police officer gave Brian a breathalyzer test which he promptly failed. The office handcuffed Brian and put him in the back of the police car. The officer then asked myself and the other passenger, who again was my roommate, if we would like to take a breath test and see if we were below the legal limit to drive Brian\u2019s car to our apartment so that it would not be towed and therefore would save Brian the impound charges. We took our breath tests and promptly failed. This is when things begin to get weird. \n\nThe officer left us with Brian\u2019s car with the car keys also. The officer drove off with Brian to take him to the local jail for booking. To this day I don\u2019t know why he left us with Brian\u2019s keys. From the time the officer pulled us over it had been approximately 20 minutes. My roommate and I had an, \u201coh so bright\u201d, idea.\n\n(Public Service Announcement: This is a good time to mention that this took place several years ago. At a time when DUI\u2019s were only just beginning to become a serious offense and driving under the influence did not hold as serious a punishment as they do today. We were young and very stupid and I do not condone anyone driving under the influence of any mind altering substance. In fact, I am extremely happy that none of us hurt anyone that night and that I can talk about this obnoxiousness today. I do not take lightly the danger we put ourselves and others in that night.)\n\nThis idea was followed by several ideas that escalated very quickly. You see.... my roommate and I were Military Police Officers. We felt bad that we let our friend drive us home and he got into trouble. With an extreme lack of judgment and against all of our common sense we decided that we would drive Brian\u2019s car back to our apartment. We didn\u2019t have far to drive but this doesn\u2019t excuse the absolute stupidity that we were acting upon. \n\nAt some point between the time we started driving Brian\u2019s car and the time we arrived at our apartment, my roommate and I came up with a grand plan of how to get Brian out of jail. This was a multi staged plan and I will break it down:\n1. Get Brian\u2019s car back to our apartment.\n2. Brush our teeth and put gum in. \n3. Shave and get into our Military Police Uniforms.\n4. Attach our guard belts to our waist so that we looked like we were on duty.\n5. Call my precinct on base and inform the dispatch not to call the jail that Brian was at. (Every night my command would call every jail in the area to check for military members so that we could take custody of them) I knew who was working dispatch that night and that person just so happened to owe me a big favor. I made it clear that I would not explain why I was asking dispatch not to call this specific jail. Dispatch agreed not to call. \n6. I called the jail Brian was at and told them that I was my command and that I was checking to see if any military members were in their jail. They stated \u201cYes\u201d and stated Brian\u2019s name. I asked if it would be okay if we come and take Brian into custody. They said \u201cyes\u201d. \n7. Switch cars. Leave Brian\u2019s car at our apartment and drive one of our own to the jail. \n8. One last pep talk and walk out the door. \nWe arrive at the jail and it\u2019s around 4am and very quite, no other cars in the jail parking lot. We go to the jail entrance and ring a buzzer. A corrections officer speaks to us through an intercom system. I speak into the intercom while looking into a camera and I inform the corrections office that we are there to take custody of Brian. They said \u201cokay\u201d. \n\nIt took about 25 minutes before we heard anything further and as you could imagine we were scared out of our minds and it felt like an eternity! It felt like the exact fear you would feel if you were trying to break a friend out of jail! Then without warning a loud buzzer sound goes off. The large thick metal door in front of us slides open and on the other side we see two corrections officers.... and.... Brian in handcuffs. I\u2019ve never personally see a ghost but at that moment I knew what a persons face would look like if they ever had seen one. Brian\u2019s jaw dropped and his face went extremely flush, ghost white! I greeted the corrections officers and told them I will put my handcuffs on Brian so that they can have theirs back. Before doing so I turned Brian around and gave him a pat down. I swapped the handcuffs and.... that was it, I had Brian in custody!!! \n\nMy roommate and I thanked the corrections officers and we turn and walk away with our hearts beating out of our chest! We are walking across the parking lot to our vehicle when my roommate whispers to me, \u201cdon\u2019t get in the car, don\u2019t get in the car\u201d. At that moment a police officer walks up behind us and looks us dead in the eyes then asks us, \u201carn\u2019t you two the passengers of the vehicle I just pull over tonight?\u201d. It was this moment that our hearts stopped and so did our breathing. \n\nLike I said, the parking lot was empty when we had arrived. No one inside or outside of the jail had caught on to us. It just so happens that the arresting officer arrived to the jail while we were in the sally port waiting for Brian to be released to us. The arresting officer was just sitting there doing paperwork in his patrol car in the jail parking lot as we walked Brian out of the jail and to our car. \n\nI\u2019m sure you can guess what happened next. Yup, we all got put in jail. About 8am our command actually came and got us. We got back to base and they told me to go home and that they would call me when they needed me and to get my things in order because this was not going to go over well. I did just that and then arrived back at my command 24 hours later and I did not leave for 45 days and then we were deployed again so I never got off base again during that stateside stay. \n\nI was punished to the fullest extent of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), the military law. I was a disappointment to many people because of this FU. I felt ashamed and I took my punishment. All the while I was the most famous person at my command. I represented what it was to have your fellow military personnel\u2019s back 100 percent! Everyone heard about this attempt to break Brian out of jail and we were practically celebrities. To this day I can not figure how in the hell I had the stupidity to try and pull this off! I am proud to say that this did not ruin my military carrier and that I did get to serve out my enlistment and be discharged honorably. Needless to say I have never FU this bad ever again in my life! The military absolutely did not condone this behavior but in some sort of way we were looked at as the most loyal friends a person could have. Our entire command had comradery like never before. It was crazy, insane, and stupid. However, like many other stories from my youthful years in the military, it\u2019s funny to look back on and I am grateful to have had the opportunity to serve with my brother in arms. Even if we did FU some times. Like breaking someone out of jail.... for a minute. \n\nTL;DR: My buddy got a DUI, I was drinking with him and in the car when he got arrested, I was a military police officer. 2 hours later I broke him out of jail by impersonating an on duty MP (one of my many convictions). The officer that arrested my buddy recognized me in the jail parking lot after I had taken custody of my buddy. We both went to jail. I almost ruined my military carrier but now many years later I look back in awe of my stupidity and the time I tried to break a friend out of jail.",

        "selftext": "So  this happened in the mid 90's.  Spider-man was knee deep in the middle  of the clone saga, one of the most controversial story arcs in comic  history.  As a 12 year old kid, I loved it.  And after reading the  latest issue, I decided to send a letter to Marvel.  E-mail was not as  widespread back then, so I printed out my letter and my mom took me to  the post office to send it.\n\nA few  months pass and I'm reading the latest issue of Spider-man.  I turn to  the letters page and what do I see but my letter, complete with my full  name printed on the back page of the comic book!  \"They printed it!\"  I  told my mom.  My dad was in the room and he asked what was going on.   Now, I love my boomer dad very much.  He's an immigrant who isn't fluent  in English and this was where the confusion started.  I told him how I  sent a letter to Marvel a few months ago and that they printed it in the  latest issue.  Now, something was obviously lost in translation because  my dad thought that I, at the age of twelve, had written and  illustrated a Spider-man story, sent it to Marvel and got published.  He  asked me several times, while looking through the comic book, \"you did  this?  You really did this?\"  I said, yes, excitedly, not knowing that  he was referring to the story and not my letter.  \"My name's right there  at the back, see!\"  I was referring to my letter, but at that point my  dad took it to mean that I was credited by Marvel for my work.\n\nMy  dad was so proud.  A few days later I noticed that my comic book was  missing.  It turns out that my dad took the comic with him and was  bragging about me at work.  \"My son made a comic book!  He wrote and  drew everything!\"  I was clueless of all this but there were a few red  flags that I should have picked up on.  For one, my dad held on that  comic book like glue.  He would look through the pages at night.  I  would also get complimented by people at his work \"there's our little  Picasso\" and so on.\n\nThen one  night, my dad asked me if I had sent anything else to Marvel.  Thinking  that he meant fan mail, I said no, I haven't sent anything since the  last one.  He told me that I should make another one.  He starts talking  to me about my \"talent\", if I want to go to art school, if Marvel paid  me etc.  It was at this point that I realized what actually happened and  how bad it had gotten.  My dad honestly believed that I had written and  illustrated an actual Marvel Comic(I have done a few sketches but  nothing close to professional work).  At that moment, I did not know  what to say.  He seemed so proud, that I was afraid he would be  disappointed if I told him.\n\n\"They did pay you right?\", he asked\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"They paid you, for the story.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"What?!?  They're ripping you off!  This is professional level work!  Is it because you're too young?\"\n\n\"Dad, I didn't write that story\"\n\n\"But you told me a few months ago that they printed it, you're name's right here!\"\n\nI  then explained to him that comic books have letter pages at the back of  the issue.  Fans send letters and Marvel prints them there.  I sent a  letter months ago and they printed it.  That's why my name was at the  back of the book.  My father scratched his head, and from his face, I  could tell that he was going through a TIFU of his own.  He picked up  the comic, flipped to the back and, with his limited knowledge of english, read my letter for the first time.\n\nHe  then starts laughing to himself, in a \"wow I really fucked up\" kind of  way.  I tell him I'm sorry and he tells me no, it's his fault.\n\nWe  still laugh about it to this day, and it's an amusing story to tell  over dinner.  My dad still kept the comic book with him though.\n\nEDIT: I won't tell what issue it was as my real name and address were printed along with the letter.  Also, don't freak out over their printing my name amd address.  Personal data security and doxxing just weren't things back in the 90s.  There was no social media back then and e-mail was just becoming widespread.  It just wasn't a big deal at the time.\n\nTLDR; TIFU by sending fan mail to Marvel Comics and getting it printed.  My dad reads it and thinks that I wrote and illustrated the story, and ends up bragging about it to his friends and coworkers.",

            "\\- SPOILER - Truth be told: Your father was on to your ruse early. His secret alter-ego was a rarely known Spiderman villain. He believed that you had secret communication with Peter Parker/Spiderman via a coded version of the comic. He took the comic to work (where his secret underground lair was located) and tried to decipher the code he thought was in the comic. When that failed, he confronted you and then realized his error. To this day, you never learned his true identity.",

I drew a lot, but mostly only characters she knew like Superman, Batman, and Spider-Man. Anyway, she was so impressed, I didn't have the heart to tell her he wasn't an original creation. Thankfully I've yet to see a Ragman comic, let alone a film so I think my secret's safe!",

            "I have a similar story about my brother and dad. Here in Russia my brother drew a picture of spider-man and green gobbling fighting each other. Then he sent it to publishers and they eventually printed the picture. Dad was so proud. He took the comic issue and showed to everyone he know.",
            "Thats a great one really! Funny how things get lost in translation.\n\nMy old neighbor is a HUGE comic book collector, he has one bedroom of his home absolutely stuffed with boxes of Marvel and DC comics, some worth a lot of money, each encased in plastic. He used to show me some of his amazing drawings of the characters, and later on, dad told me that he actually did calligraphy in some of the old Marvel comic books, and was trying to get on with them to do illustrations, but to no avail. Still pretty neat though! Now, it may not be true, but i wouldnt be surprised if he really did. Dad and him were friends since they were kids, and i mean, the guy has a few different pictures of him with Stan Lee himself, as well as a few illustrators, etc.",

Interns (if there was one) got to read and filter/file the letters. There were a lot of people that hated that story line and sent in very long (two paged, front and back, typed letters) letting them know that. It was always great to get letters that could actually be published! So thanks for taking the time to write that!",

Being proud of you for thinking you wrote it, being mad you don\u2019t get paid, encouraging you to pursue your talent (even if he was wrong in thinking it) and being cool and having it be a life long family moment. I think this all is wonderful and I\u2019m glad you shared it.",

If you could draw a marvel comic book at the age of twelve, you're parents will certainly know about your talent because it doesn't happen without hundreds of hours of work, writing, drawing etc. If his father thinks he had enough time to do that without anyone noticing, he's either stupid or negligent. The fact that he paraded it like it's his achievement at work, without following up on how the fuck his child did this is another red flag.... the other option is that this tifu is just creative writing, but I hate that option.\n\nEdit: The bragging would be absolutely justified if the dad invested in this, bought materials, spent money on lessons. I'm all for proud parents, if they are involved.",

        "selftext": "**Bird audio hyperlinked at the very end**\n\nI am so dead. My roommate is out of town camping until the end of the weekend and he's going to kill me when he finds out.\n\nOk, so we all know the story with [CBAT](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/x35iu6/tifu_my_20f_girlfriend_of_two_years_told_me_the/), no need to go into that. My roommate is out of town for a week, and I have the whole apartment to myself. Four days ago, I (29m) asked my gf (29f) if she would like to enjoy some delicious fun time while blasting CBAT. Her and I are both super weird, and are open to doing this kind of dumb stuff. To no surprise, she laughed and said yes. I just thought it would be funny to experience. To my surprise, it really wasn't as weird as I thought it would be. It might be that the love I have for her is so powerful, that it left only about 5% of my brain power focusing on the dolphin sounds in the background.\n\nThe next day we decided to go at it again, only this time CBAT was a surprise for her. After a few minutes of kissing, I turned on the music and we both started laughing hysterically before getting it on. I even lasted longer than the day before, which I now regret.\n\nHere's the problem which I stupidly did not even take a second to consider. While my roommate is out of town, I'm taking care of his parrot who dwells in our living room, which shares a very thin door with my bedroom. This is no ordinary parrot. This is a chattering lory (same bird as that red one on youtube who goes \"wuewuewue\"). This bird does not shut up. He makes so much noise that I've naturally learned to ignore him after a year of living with it.\n\nAnyway, somehow it never even crossed my mind that these parrots learn words and sounds and mimic them surprisingly accurately. Before leaving for work yesterday morning, I made some coffee and sat down in the living room for a bit just relaxing and closing my eyes. All of a sudden, I hear the first few notes of CBAT in perfect pitch and rhythm. I opened my eyes and this little dude is staring me dead in the face. 5-10 seconds pass, and I hear it again. I just grabbed my things and left for work immediately. I had to escape, figuring I'd just find a way to fix this or explain this later. But the more I think about it, the more I realize that I'm just dead. My roommate isn't weird like me and he hates when I say silly things to the bird. When he comes back this weekend, I'm worried he's gonna give a notice and leave.\n\nAny advice on how to go about this would be greatly appreciated. I'm sweating as I'm writing this.\n\nAnd no, for privacy reasons, I will not be posting a video of the bird.\n\nTL;DR I tried intercourse with my gf twice while blasting CBAT just for the experience, and my roommate's parrot learned the song. My roommate doesn't know about this yet.\n\nEDIT: When I get back home from work today, I will sit by the bird and record audio.\n\nEDIT 2: Hyperlinked CBAT above for those who haven't read the story.\n\nEDIT 3: [Here\u2019s the audio you skeptics](https://voca.ro/16NdnZIFs0d4).

Then, when it makes a noise/displays a behavior that is favorable, shower it with attention. in a bird's brain, the louder, more agitated you get, the more they think they are doing a good thing.\n\nI know it's counterintuitive, but this really is the best way to teach a bird - ignore bad behavior, reward good behavior.",

So I send it away!\n\n...Nope.\n\nHe isn\u2019t excited, and he isn\u2019t laughing. He said it freaks him out.\n\nI asked him why, and assured him it\u2019s just a harmless filter.\n\nWhat he said next broke my heart.\n\n\u201cI know I\u2019ll never see you that old.\u201d\n\nTL;DR: I used the crazed FaceApp to send a photo of my old ass self to my dad, resulting in him being really sad and breaking my heart. Fuck.\n\nEdit: Whoah!! Did not expect this response. Thank you strangers for my first gold!!!\n\nEdit 2: Thank you for my second and third gold!!! Wow.",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m a teacher. A kindergarten teacher. And I should know better. \n\nRight now, for some reasons, Kindergarten is on Zoom. I teach from my dining room table, because it is the best space with the best light. Unfortunately, there\u2019s a big sliding glass door in my dining room and it\u2019s not one of those fancy double pane insulating ones, either. Oh, and I removed the curtains months ago because I wanted all that sweet, sweet sunlight to illuminate my sweet, sweet teaching. So it\u2019s kinda cold. My feet are always freezing. Last night I  asked my dear husband to please bring in the space heater from the garage, so I could put it in the dining room to warm my piggies during Zoom Kindergarten. \n\nNow dear husband is really a dear, and I love him and he loves me. But. BUT. Sometimes he\u2019s a bit of a nag and a worrier. And the space heater lives in the garage because he hates it - always concerned that I\u2019m going to burn the house down or the cat will set herself on fire. Still - because he loves me, he brought it in. And because he\u2019s a worrier and a nag, he reminded me this morning to keep it three feet away from furniture, upholstery, and the (currently nonexistent) curtains. And for god\u2019s sake be careful. And because I love him, I waited until he was out of the room before I rolled my eyes, tucked that bad boy under the table, and fired it up. \n\nNow this hot beast cycles on and off. It was getting me nice and toasty while we reviewed rhyming words. My feet stayed warm while we read \u201cThe Mitten\u201d and cut out animal pictures. It shut off for a while when we were watching a Scholastic Magazine video about arctic animals, so by the time we finished my tootsies were feeling the Arctic Chill. I pulled the heater in just a little closer. The cat was into it, too. I mean, I take full responsibility but we were in this together. \n\nAbout halfway through Measuring Length With Linking Cubes, I felt like my legs were maybe a wee bit to hot, so I tucked my feet back under my chair. We wrapped up with a Jack Hartmann video \u201cCount to 100 and Exercise\u201d and about an hour ago I waved the kinders off for their asynchronous work time, and got up to make myself some tea. Of COURSE I turned the heater off. I\u2019m careful like that. Plus, the cat was sitting closer than she probably should have. \n\nBut as I sat down with my cuppa, I noticed a stinging sensation just below my right knee. I pulled my pant leg up and kids, I was shook. I have angry red splotches on the front of my leg, and the beginnings of a blister. It is not pretty. And now that I look at it, it kinda hurts, too. \n\nFolks, be careful with your space heaters. It was 3 feet away from anything combustible EXCEPT for me and the cat. She\u2019s fine, but I\u2019m slightly flame-broiled. \n\nAnd I am NOT telling my husband. He would be kind and sympathetic and he might even resist the urge to say \u201cI told you so\u201d but he would never never forget. So I\u2019ll be wearing knee high socks to bed for a while until this heals. I\u2019m an idiot. \n\nTLDR: TIFU (yup, today) by broiling my limb on a heater, and now I have to hide it because I, a grown-ass woman, can\u2019t bear to see my husband\u2019s pitying look and read the reproachful \u201cBut I WARNED you!!\u201d in his eyes.\n\nEdit: Sincere thanks to all who showed concern & gave treatment advice. It\u2019s several hours later, and the blister is about the size and shape of a large sunflower seed. I have about 6 similarly sized livid spots below it, and one a little larger. The total amount of injured skin is probably just over a square inch. I\u2019ve treated it with aloe and Vitamin E. \n\nI\u2019m sending the heater back to the garage. The cat will be disappointed.",

You should definitely be able to feel that kind of burning well before blistering point. \n\nMy best friend years ago, at age 18 or so, burned her leg on a heater because her legs were always too cold. Shortly after she was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes, apparently it was part of why she was too cold and didn't feel her leg burning in time. I assume as a teacher you're well beyond the Type 1 diabetes age, but it may be worth looking into whether that's normal.

Once we finished and Were to get ready for the interview in formal attire, one of the dudes comes walking out in his blazer, dress shirt, socks, and shoes.... And gym shorts. Due to the way interviews were done with this agency, we were all shuttled to location and this guy had no chance to figure anything out.

She opened the door in the middle of the night to throw something in the garbage and the door slammed shut behind her. She rang and knocked but my dad did not hear her from the other side of the apartment. Here\u2019s the problem - there was no way to get to the front door to ring the main bell (not that he would have heard it probably) and the other little problem - she was NAKED! She ended up taking the bin liner out of the can and covering herself with it, and walking downstairs to the lobby where the night doorman called upstairs on the phone and then she took the elevator back upstairs and let herself in. \nAnd took a shower, I guess.\nIt\u2019s so funny how she actually told this story to so many people!!",

It was after midnight at this point, so he just went out in his boxer briefs and a t-shirt to dump the water just outside of the complex door - a door that automatically locks. He pushes the door all the way open to prop it so it wouldn't close, and took a few steps into the grass to dump the water. As he turns back around, the door is closing, and he doesn't make it in time, and it locks him out. He doesn't have anything on him except his underwear and a bucket.\n\nNow, it's late. The apartment office is closed. So he cuts his losses and starts walking the half mile to the nearest 24 hour convenience store. He gets there, wants to call someone, but he doesn't know anybody's phone number by memory. None at all. Not our parents. Not me. Not his best friend. So he asks them for a phone book and looks up his best friend's parents and calls them, and his best friend picks him up and lets him stay the night, and they go in the morning to get back into his apartment.\n\nWhen I got married about a year later, we had little stars that we had everyone sign and put their best advice, and his said \"never leave home without pants\".",

We didn't have a spare keys in the conservatory and so we ended up being stuck in there for 3 hours until our mum came home.

So now we're walking down a dark path to meet up with up with friends, and I'm still rolling this ball of wax around in my hand when I decide I don't want it anymore. I don't want to just throw it on the ground. That would be littering. No trash cans nearby, but I've suddenly decided I don't want to hold it anymore.

It was literally someone screaming bloody murder. I have no idea how it got that way or if he was the only person that got that specific greeting.

After a year I forgot I had it. \n\nPeople would intermittently remind me I had it. It wasn\u2019t until a job interview that the potential employer informed me that he thought he called a radio station when calling me. \n\nI panic called tech support at my cell provider asking them to remove it. The tech swore up down left and right that \u201cCHANGING MY PLAN\u201d would reset the ringback tone to default. Well he didn\u2019t inform me that default wasn\u2019t the traditional ringing tone. Default was Eine kleine Nachtmusik by Mozart. \n\nNow I don\u2019t mind classical music at all. I like it. I mind it when people tell me that they, \u201cTried to call you but they kept getting in contact with a Banquet Hall, or an Opera House, instead of you.\u201d I kept reaching out to tech support but they couldn\u2019t figure out how to reset it. \n\nThis lasted from 2004 till 2017 when I finally switched service providers.

        "selftext": "The original fuckup happend Friday last week but I only realized yesterday.\n\nObvious throwaway to not dox myself.\n\nBackground: I work in IT for a rather big school. We're the only school for that education level in the whole state (happend in Europe but so you can better imagine the size of the school). As IT we have to do tasks from other areas too - including managing the system responsible for the speakers and announcements.\n\nSchool ended on June 19, they basically just opened the school to give the students the opportunity to say goodbye to each other. On the first week of summer break there where only a few teachers still there, preparing stuff for next year, organizing their stuff, cleaners and so on.\n\nIn the week of June 29 no body - really nobody - was there except me. Everyone either took vacation or \"worked\" from home. So last Friday I thought it would be funny to meddle a bit with the system for the announcements. What's the funniest thing you could do over speakers? Right. Soviet Anthem. Funnies \\*\\*\\*\\* I've ever seen. Or so I thought. '50 indicates that the lesson has finished and students have a break and should go to the next class, '00 announces start of the next lesson. I replaced both with the soviet anthem, had a good chuckle and went home.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYesterday I went in back again to upgrade a few servers and I was surprised to have lots of cars on the parking lots - including those with military number signs. As soon I entered the building the janitor saw me and then I learned that I massively fucked up. As my country had rising number of corona-cases again the government decided to put up a taskforce. To maintain social distancing of 2m (or 1.5m) they needed big rooms. Well, we have big auditoriums. And the military who also acts as civil defence (don't know the word for it) was involved. Since people from all across the state came and had to help the local hospital and other tasks they decided that they have all meetings in the auditoriums. And the military can sleep in the empty classrooms (to reduce the number of people sharing one room). I mean it made sense, we even had many showers that are intended for emergencies next to the chemistry labs.\n\nThey got blasted with the soviet anthem twice per hour between 07:00 and 17:00. They didn't liked it. The janitor tried to contact my boss at the beginning of the week but my boss cut him off before he could explain (\"something's wrong with the speakers, \" \"I'm on vacation and nobody is at school, don't annoy me!\").\n\nMany speakers got disconnected, they couldn't disconnect those in the classrooms. I feel terrible for those who worked night shifts and had to endure while trying to sleep.\n\nI disabled it and apologized for the inconvenience. Everyone I saw was pretty annoyed.\n\nBoss will be back on Monday and I'll have a lot of explaining to prepare.\n\ntl;dr: Replaced the school announcement system with the soviet anthem without knowing that state government and military will use the school during summer break.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the awards but please don't give me awards. Not only is this a throwaway account , I would prefer it if you donate the equivalent amount of money (even if its just 5 bucks) to a local organization, either helping people who lost their job due corona, animal shelters and so on.

To really get in the mood, we pulled up a youtube video of the 50s soviet anthem and blasted it. We were all trying to sing along even though only one of us knew Russian, but we were taking the piss and having a great time.

This was late 80s time frame so keep in mind most people did not know too much about computers and abilities we take for granted now where magic back then. \n\nI was taking a computer music class and since I was an early adopter for technology and a total geek as a kid, I had fun tools no one else had. I used one such tool to digitize a bunch of sounds and my lab partner and I were using them to sample in the music and do fun things (like the old singing sheep song). \n\nBecause these computers were only used for this one class, and because we were the only class that semester, our workstation was for all purposes exclusively ours for the semester. So of course we adjusted all the settings and of course we set the alert sound to something we digitized, and since we were teen age boys of course that was something inappropriate. \n\nThe following Monday I\u2019m walking past the music room, which is where the computer music class was held, and the regular band/music teacher grabs me and pulls me into his office. He spends the next 10 minutes flipping out on me and all but punching me he is so angry. The whole time I am doing my best not to bust out laughing. \n\nWhy? Well it seems he had a promising student ask for a letter of recommendation, which he was happy to provide and type up right then, while the student and her parents were there discussing the students musical future. By pure dumb luck the computer he decided to use was mine. Late 80s, new to computers, he has issues doing what he wants, triggering the alert sound over and over... my customized alert sound. There in front of a young girl and her parents, this teacher had the computer screaming over and over \u201cPENIS!

The train was the easiest option, with no school buses running close to my place. The train was taken by students from many schools, who for some reason or another always seemed to be cooler than me and my mates, so I took every word they said as gospel. One day I was on the 20 min train ride home from school, and this guy was telling some (I now realise, likely bullshit) story of how he sprained his hand. He recounted to us younger lads how he was fingering some chick and she sneezed, supposedly contracting her whole body and getting his fingers stuck inside, now sprained. Now, being the horny af 14-year-old I was, I thought this was fuckin hot. I had discovered porn but for the most part liked to wank by myself and my own imagination. \n\nHere's the problem. Being a 14-year-old, socially awkward Christian boy who went to an all-boys school, there was little in the way of imaginative content that came my way, so I latched onto this. Most days, for several months, this would be my imagined content for my night-time masturbation. In essence, when wanking, I thought of sneezing.\n\nOne day, I don't even remember when, I STARTED sneezing. I had no idea why, not understanding the implications of what i was doing at all. Now, five years later, I still sneeze without fail, even when thinking of being horny and in turn, any sneeze I have turns me on. I bet any future wife of mine is in for a big surprise.\n\nTL;DR: wanked to a bullshit story about sneezing, now I sneeze when I'm horny and horny when I sneeze\n\nEdit: I thought I should add after the comments I've received that I genuinely had no idea about the genetic link, and so I spent 5 years convinced the above story was the cause of the sneeze. Thank you Reddit for your infinite wisdom, I no longer worry about the power of my own brain.",

No one was in there when I went in so I thought nothing of it, other than it was odd that the Men's room didn't have any urinals. I did my business and as I was getting ready to leave the stall I hear two of my female co-workers walk in chatting.\n\nI was confused as hell, told them I thought they had the wrong bathroom, they laughed and pointed to the sign on the door (it hadn't closed fully yet) and laughed really hard when they realized I didn't know which bathroom I was in. \n\nSuffice it to say, they all had a good laugh at it, and I did as well. When we came in the next day I found that the company's bathroom doors in our department had printed signs on the bathrooms, the women's was a circle with a slash through it in red with my name in it and the Men's had a short sentence, essentially saying, \"This is the right room for you!\" I didn't make a big deal out of it. \n\nI had to learn long ago not to have very much shame because other people will use it against you.

Hers was copper tinted, mine was stainless steel. apart from that they were identical. I loved it! But after a while, being the absent minded person that I am, mine goes missing. \"No biggie\", I said to myself, \"My wife is staying home today, I'll just take her thermos to work.\" So I fixed me up a nice thermos full of black coffee, and headed out the door to work.\n\nThis particular day was rather busy, and I had meetings back to back pretty much all morning. I had my thermos and laptop in tow, and was migrating from one conference room to another, when I realized I needed to run to the urination station. So I dropped off my laptop and thermos, ran and relieved myself, then stopped back by my cubical to pick up a couple of reports for the meeting.\n\nWhile sorting the papers at my desk, I reach over and grab for my thermos and take a big swig of coffee. Immediately, a few alarms and thoughts went through my head. \"This coffee got pretty cold pretty fast today...that's odd. Also I don't remember putting any cream or sugar in it this morning...that's odd. Also what is this texture??\"\n\nAt this point, still mid-gulp, I shift my eyes down to the top of the thermos, which has a clear plastic lid, and I notice a very large floating blob of mold, which I had just taken a sizable chunk out of. Also I notice the thermos is stainless steel, not copper colored.This was my coffee that had been sitting on my computer desk, in plain sight, for a month. Oh no...I thought as I immediately reach for the trashcan to try and lurch the coffee back out, but to my disappointment it would not come back up. So I run to the bathroom and try a full on puking position to try and get it back up, again no luck. I just knew I was going to get deathly ill, but actually I didn't get sick beyond the mental stress of having just consumed an entire family of slimy, chunky mold spores and rotten cream.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Took my thermos to work, forgot about it. Took my wife's to work a few weeks later. Accidentally drank from my month old coffee and got a nice dose of penicillin and rotten cream.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:  My apologies to anyone I made chunder this morning!\n\nEdit 2: For clarification - I just borrowed my wife's thermos, filled it with fresh coffee, and took it to work. Hers wasn't the moldy one. Mine was, as it had been setting at my desk for a month.",

            "I did just about the same thing the other day.  When I'm at the office I drink a couple of cups of tea with a bit of sugar and honey.  I've started working from home a lot more than I used to.  I came back to the office after about 2 weeks of working at home so the first thing I do is grab my tea cup for a cup of tea.\n\nIt's the kind with the strainer and lid mostly used with loose-leaf teas, but I ran out a while back and have been using tea bags lately.  I unscrewed the cap and strainer, pulled the 2 tea bags out that I'd left in it and filled it up with hot water.\n\nGot back to my desk, threw in 2 new tea bags, honey and sugar.  After it cooled down a bit I lifted it up to take a drink and when the cup was almost to my lips and horizontal I saw a big disgusting moldy *thing* waving at me from the bottom of the cup.\n\nEvidently a layer of mold had grown on the bottom of the cup and the hot water dislodged half of it so I stopped myself just in time.  But I feel you,  this:\n\n***\"...the mental stress of having just consumed an entire family of slimy, chunky mold spores and rotten cream.\"***\n\nAlmost made me puke just by reading it.",

            "Uhhh, this reminds me of the time i drank maggots. We had a kettle that we kept on the stove. I'm the only one who ever used it, and I would only boil water in it. Admittedly i should have washed it, considering i hadn't used it in a couple weeks, but i only ever boiled water in it. I always emptied it out afterwards, so I figured all was good.  I filled it up, boiled it, and put it into my cup which had a lot of creamer and instant coffee already in there. About halfway through my coffee, i realized there were these white rice looking things in it. I went to the sink and poored it out to find it was filled with maggots. And i had drank half of it already. After gagging and contemplating life, I investigated the kettle. Apparently, my brother came home drunk one day and made some kinda ramen soup in there. He didn't wash it, just set it right back on the stove. Couple weeks later, maggots! I still get shivers from that. I'll never use another piece of dishware or kitchenware without giving it a top down. Still not sure how exactly maggots got in there. It looks sealed to me.",

I just throw this two liter back like nothing. I take 3-4 BIG chugs off that bottle before I noticed there something was off.

        "selftext": "This actually did happen today and I'm still kind of shaken up from my initial reaction.\n\n\nBasically me and my GF of almost 3 years now are in a long distance relationship due to us both being in college. We're both from the same hometown so during summer we can see each other freely because we both come home to work. Long Distance is hard as fuck, so summer is a great time for us to fuck like Catholics to make up for the time we spent apart. Fortunately she's on the pill so we don't have to use condoms. Great right? Wrong.\n\n\nLast night we were hanging out and were going to get busy, but she ended up getting a headache and as a result wasn't in the mood. I went home with blue balls, and decided that I was tired too and just wanted to sleep it off. After going in and out of sleep, I eventually decided that I needed to get off, and ol' reliable would have to do.\n\n\nI loaded up pornhub and started browsing through the videos until I found one of those casting tapes that looked good enough for me. I got the lotion ready and lathered up my meat scepter, but stopped to do a double take. The girl in the video looked like my girlfriend. Exactly like my girlfriend. I was thinking \"Oh cool this is basically like jerking off to moving nudes\", and began to jack it.\n\n\nBut once the fucking started, my heart stopped. She had the same birthmark as my GF did, same spot below her ass, same shape and everything. This wasn't a look alike, this WAS my girlfriend. I grabbed my earbuds to plug in, and sure enough, it was her voice speaking to the camera explaining how she was doing this because she needed money for college.\n\n\nI checked below the video title and saw that it linked the actors/actresses and saw her screen name. I was hesitant, but clicked on it. Turns out this wasn't a one time quick cash deal, because on my screen I was looking at page after page, video after video of my GF being railed by giant porn dicks. My girl wasn't as innocent as I thought. She was a porn starlet.\n\n\nI was so fucking torn right then. So many feelings started running through my brain. It now made sense why she suddenly decided to go on the pill last year without really having a reason. She was always complaining about money so this made sense why she would do it.\n\n\nI then started freaking out about STDs. None of the videos had the guys using condoms and several were creampies. We were both each other's firsts so once she was on the pill we ditched condoms because we knew neither of us had anything, but now I was terrified I had been duped. Not to mention we had been plowing like crazy over the past few months, so my worries were heightened because this was very much recent. I realized that it was late enough that I couldn't do anything so I went to bed again.\n\n\nI woke up the next morning in cold sweats. I was angry, pissed, and emotionally a wreck. I sent a text to my girlfriend calling her a slut and a liar and everything in the book I could think of. I called up my doctor's office and scheduled an STD test. Fortunately they could take me right then so I drove over. \n\n\nAfter the tests were finished, I got a text from my girlfriend. \"What the fuck are you talking about???\". I was even angrier than before. That little bitch was gonna act dumb about it?  I was furious, but I had evidence. She wasn't gonna get out of this one without some explaining. \n\n\nI fired up pornhub again to find the videos, but I couldn't find the casting one I started on last night. No worries, I remember her stage name. I typed it into the search bar, again surprised by what I found. Not because I was looking at her being railed by other dudes again, but because the videos weren't there. They didn't exist.\n\n\nNow I was just fucking confused. I tried other porn websites, but came up with the same results: nothing. I knew I saw them last night tho, so I knew they were there though, right?\n\n\nAnd that's when the realization hit. Remember how I said I was drifting in and out of sleep before getting up to jerk it? It was all a dream. A very bad dream. My brain decided that a great dream to have would be my Girlfriend being a pornstar, forcing me to watch her bang other dudes.\n\n\nSo here I am explaining to my girlfriend like an idiot how I had a dream she was a pornstar without my knowledge, apologizing for all the names I called her, and sitting in awe at how badly this could've turned out. Fortunately she seems to be mostly understanding of this, so I think we're good for now.\n\n\nTL;DR: Had a very realistic dream that my GF was doing porn, gave myself a heartache, sent her a very angry text over nothing, and wasted my morning in a Doctors office taking STD tests for diseases I don't have.\n\n\nEdit: OK Holy shit this blew up overnight. I can't reply to most of the comments/questions/concerns so I'll try to break it down by groups that I see most frequently commenting.\n\n\nFor everyone saying the relationship is done: Surprisingly not. She took it pretty well and were talking this through pretty openly. I'm gonna go over later tonight in person just to make sure, but it hasn't gone nearly as bad as I thought it would.\n\n\nFor the conspiracy theorist: Nah, the videos don't exist. She didn't pull them or anything, there were enough videos that on a normal PH page there would definitely be at least one re upload. I checked my browser history, nothing there, and nothing is ever deleted on the internet, and I trust my GF so I'm fine on that note.\n\n\nFor the \"YTA\" crowd: Yeah I know that's why this is on TIFU and not on wholesome stuff or smthn.\n\n\nFor the \"sex work is real work, you're just misogynistic\" crowd: Sex work is a real job and I'm not contesting that. I also don't care if my partners body count is as long as Troy Polamalu's hair, or as short as OJ Simpsons prison sentence. What I got mad at was that she was CURRENTLY banging dudes without my knowledge, breaching my trust of her, and crossing a deal breaker for me. Obviously it never happened but that was what I was mad at, not anything else.\n\n\nFor everyone getting mad at me for not knowing how porn STD tests work: thanks. Now I know I guess?\n\n\nAlso shout-out to the one guy who thinks it's fake solely bc he never heard of jacking off in bed before. Can't find your comment but it gave me a good chuckle.",

        "selftext": "This all happened over approximately 5 seconds. It's a lazy Saturday morning and I'm chilling in bed a bit longer than normal, browsing reddit and just hanging out. My cat, approximately 12 weeks old, is somewhere (but not currently bothering me, so it's okay.) While laying in bed, apparently by myself, I am stricken with the urge to fart; being a single mid twenties guy, I think \"better let 'er rip\" and thus began my morning from hell.\n\nThe instant I rumbled the mattress, I felt a mass rush up under the blankets. Unbeknownst to me, my cat was laying under the blankets near, but not touching, my feet; he must have heard the thunder down under and panicked.\n\nIt is important to note that when I make my bed, I tuck the blanket beneath the mattress; it's a holdover from Marine Corps days. Well unfortunately for all involved, the blanket was still tucked on the side the cat was laying on. The poor baby had no way to escape the gas chamber. As a consequence, he panicked. And what do animals do when they panic? That's right, they bite and claw.\n\nMy cat, probably choking to death, thus began to try and dig his way out. Not through the blanket, oh no. He tried to multitask and punish me for my sins by trying to dig right through my back. He clawed and bit so hard he started drawing blood. Now we are both panicking, and I ripped the blanket off as fast as I possibly could; too little too late for him, as he now has Post Traumatic Stank Disorder, and too late for me as I now look like I fought a very disgruntled family of raccoons. He leapt from the bed and turned to give me the DIRTIEST look I've ever seen a cat give a human being before sauntering into the bathroom, where he remains as I type this.\n\nTL;DR thought I was alone in bed, farted, and dutch ovened my cat. Cat panicked and absolutely mauled me. Now we're both upset.\n\nEdit: for spelling\n\nEdit 2: Electric Boogaloo: first if all, thank you for the awards and upvotes. Glad people can enjoy our shared misery. A lot of people are asking for cat tax; there's a few pictures of him elsewhere on my profile so feel free to help yourselves. I can try to get a picture of him but he is still avoiding me this morning. Here is a link to the most recent photo I have of him on reddit. Please don't send the IRS to collect cat tax; I quite like my kneecaps un-shattered. https://www.reddit.com/r/IllegallySmolCats/comments/lx1kjy/this_little_man_followed_me_into_the_bathroom_and/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share\n\nEdit Yet again: someone commented that this is apparently one of the bits done on Impractical Jokers. I have never seen it, and was not familiar with the bit going in.",

            "I'm about to tell a story that seems too silly to be real. But it feels appropriate right now.\n\nOne day many years ago I was playing the OG playstation. I can't remember which game, but it was either Final Fantasy 7, Tomb Raider, or Wipeout XL. I was really into it, and I remember having that feeling you get when you're about to finally accomplish the goal you set out for. \n\nMy cat Cheeto had been somewhere in my periphery, but I was too sucked into this game to acknowledge him. He either wanted food, attention, or he wanted me to let him outside. I don't remember now. In any case, he was getting impatient.\n\nJust as I was reaching my goal, my cat jumped up onto the playstation. It's important to note that the OG playstation had two large buttons on top, the power button, and the open button. If my cat had stepped on the open button, the lid would have lifted, but the game would have probably remained \"paused\" until I closed the lid. My cat stepped on the power button. But that didn't immediately turn my game off. No, the power wouldn't officially turn off until my cat lifted his paw.\n\nThere was nothing I could do, but stair at him while he locked eyes with me -- his foot firmly pressed down on the power button. Just as the situation became clear in my mind -- that my cat had taken control of my life -- the mother fucker *farted.* **Audibly**. Then he casually lifted his paw and walked toward the door so I could let him outside.\n\nSorry, I don't have a picture for the cat tax. He had dramatic grey stripes, with piercing green eyes. He was very much a male cat, with a bulky shoulder area, and skinny back side. He spent a lot of time outside, and could jump from really high distances and smoothly land directly into a sprint. He died about 5 years after that hilarious encounter with the playstation.",

He said cat bites get infected very easily and are typically aggressive; nearly put me in the hospital as a precaution but gave me giant antibio pills and the tetnus shot instead (I'm also mid 20s and hadnt a fever which is probably why. My tetnus was also out of date)\n\nI strongly recommend you get it looked at soon just in case.",

When she stuck her head out of the blanket she was panting a little and the top of her head reeked like eggs so bad it was insane.

        "selftext": "Okay, I just want to start this by admiting something. I am a perv. So is my fianc\u00e9e. It's a pretty nice yin-yang thing except we're both yangs. We make crass jokes fairly frequently, like to phone bone and are adamant memennials (it makes her cringe, had to write it).\n\nAnyway, we've been living apart for a while as we finish college. The last couple of months have been a little rough for us though. I have been hit by not one but two different hurricanes and have not had power or internet until today. On top of that, my program is all gas no brakes. I've had back to back, to back, exams and have had practically zero interaction with my fellow Yang.\n\nToday, I managed to finally gain access to the internet and was able to see her for the first time in what felt like forever. This was an exciting moment to say the least, and I wanted to make the most of it. But how would I do it? Yang didn't know I had internet access yet, so I had a couple hours to ponder and prepare before nightfall. I turned off the lights, lit a few candles and placed them on my desk. Opened my laptop and tilted the screen to the optimal angle and began the call. She answered the phone excitidly, and I greeted Yang with wang while shouting **LAUGH** as I slapped my jimmy dean on the table, thus initiating our romantic rendezvous. Perfect execution. Delivered the package with more gusto than those FedEx drivers in the pornos. But here's the fuck up. There was laughter. Too much laughter for one Yang and one wang.  It happened to be one of her friends birthdays and they were gathered around her phone to say hi. Her face was red, my boner was dead, and the call ended faster than my hopes of getting head.\n\nShe texted me after, freaking out. Telling me that we'll talk later. I appologized because I figured she would be alone at the time. She said her friends won't leave her alone now. I'm pretty sure they're all drunk. Her friends keep sending me small dick memes.\n\n\ntldr: Slapped dick on table for funny sexy time, got laughed at by her friends and am currently getting more small dick memes than a jockey private detective.\n\nUpdate: Holy shit guys...thought my alarm was going off...but no it\u2019s just this post is blowing up at 4 in the morning! Thank you all for the awards and comments. It\u2019s been a pleasure reading them and it is honestly just a great all around experience. But none of you care about thanks! I\u2019m not as small brained as you might think. I know why you\u2019re here. You have questions, I have answers.\n\n1. Let me hijack my own post real quick. The city of Lake Charles really got hit hard by these hurricanes. Pretty much the entire southwestern portion of the state suffered heavy damages. What has been shown in media isn\u2019t comparable to what it has been like in person. So, please show some love to the area if you can!\n\n2. Yes, Jacksepticeye\u2019s famous LAUGH meme was the inspiration behind my mating call. Maybe one day he\u2019ll read this and think about my di...wonderful use of the English language.\n\n3. Her friends sobered up and stopped sending me memes. Honestly think they might have just ran out for the time being. Yang calmed down and laughed about it. She said that her friends were just busting my balls because got a full view of them. I was not nearly as amused.\n\n4. Lastly, as far as size goes, I will not confirm or deny anything. My fianc\u00e9e and unfortunately now her friends will be the only ones privy to that info. So I\u2019ll play the proverbial cocktease. But all good teases have to please at least a little. So, I\u2019ll leave you with another silly rhyme. \n\nIs it big or is it little? Something huge or a tiny skittle? Long, hard, short...uhm...hard. Thicc like a tire or thin as a card? Honestly it doesn\u2019t matter, work with what you have, and give them a good splatter.\n\nEdit: spelling",

        "selftext": "This happened last Thursday on the first week I had my kids after getting forcefully separated from my wife.  In the span of two weeks, I slept in hotels, friends campers, signed a new lease (on life and a house), purchased a bunch of divorced guy furniture from Craigslist, went to court to stand trial and negotiate a settlement, barely interacted with the outside world and never really contemplated the entire sudden fiasco entirely.  I was just trying to create a new home the state would deem worthy of my seeing my kids.  Last Sunday (2/28) was the first time I got to see them for a week at the new house since the break up.  It was rough, brutal, and confusing for everybody involved for the first few days, but we found a rhythm by Wednesday.  That day, I received an email from a local venue about restarting showing movies in their outdoor seating area during the day since the weather had improved considerably.  Just enter your name and those attending with you and win a chance for 6 tickets and a table to watch the movie in mid-afternoon.  Being the new single dad, I wanted everything and signed up and we won, not knowing that everyone who signed up actually won because they needed to generate business since no one had been to the venue since fall.  The contest was a ploy that worked wonderfully to draw folks out.\n\nSPOiler for plot of Inside Out: I'd never heard of Inside Out before because we normally don't attend movies, but watch some netflix.  We show up right as the movie is beginning, order a pizza and wait and watch.  Nothing fancy, then I realize its a movie about emotions that occur after a huge tumultuous break up in a girls life when she moves from the mid-west to California.\n\nLong story short, they comb through the child's entire psyche, reaching all the way back to her childhood, core memories with her parents, joy, sadness, anger, etc.  Tears are streaming down my face as the buzzer lets me know the pizza is ready.  I walk over, grab it and head back.  We are silently munching through our pizza when the forgotten memory rocket ride scene takes place. In it, the emotion,  Joy, and Bing-Bong, the childhood imaginary elephant friend of the protagonist, are trying to escape a pit of forgotten memories.  They are riding an imaginary wagon that is powered by rocket rainbows fueled by singing.  With both of them, its too heavy to make it up a cliff and out to save the main character.  Bing-Bong decides at the last minute to eject himself from the wagon to make it lighter and sacrifice himself so his friend, the main girl, can find happiness again.  I couldn't hold back any longer and straight up wailed and cried so loud other socially distanced tables were looking over and holding their kids close to them. I tried to stop, but 15 years of marriage, two kids, soccer games, schools, vacations, deaths in the families, secret handshakes, whispers, brownies, sunday drives, and beach trips overwhelmed me and everything flooded out at once.  It was terribly embarrassing for me and my kids.  I couldn't hide it or stop it no matter how hard I tried.\n\nJust then the wind picked up and blew the pizza box, plates, napkins, water bottles and coloring books off the table and strewn them across the venue in broad daylight.  The movie is blaring, I'm bawling, my children are confused and crying, and everyone is frantically trying to help me pick up my life.  Luckily, my son, in the middle of the entire fiasco, walks over to a nearby table, stoops down and picks one of our pieces of pizzas off the pavement and removes some trash from it before taking a bite, then turns around looking at me and yells Dad, pick me up one of those waters off the ground will you!  It was the comic relief every table needed and everyone broke into laughter.  We slumped over to our table and finished the movie holding each other and rocking back and forth.  We had not addressed the situation fully at that point, but the ride home was insightful and we talked a great deal.  I still have a lot of work to do and relationship repair, but we are headed in the right direction.\n\nTLDR; recently separated, brought kids to see Inside Out, broke down in front of everyone processing the recent events of my life.\n\nEdit: Thank you all for outright recognition of my situation through posts, messages, awards and generally reading it.  What you all have shared has inspired me to keep going and in some perverse way belong to a great family toiling away everyday in hidden pain that I am now in tune with.  I've always kept everything at a distance, possibly to avoid this pain and perhaps that is what I contributed to the dissolution of my marriage among other behaviors and not getting help sooner. I have done good things, I have helped people before on r/depression who have reached out and made community contributions around town.  I just needed to be seen and heard today. Their mother is great, she is going to be fine and I am going to continually support everything they do because I'll be right here about a mile from their house they could walk over if they wanted to.  You can believe this.\n\nI can assure you this is real and it happened, I'm real and nothing is fabricated. Yes, I contributed to the break-up, but that's not what this is about.  I made sure to rent a house in the same town near their school in order to maintain presence in their lives and minimize the turbulence. I cooked all our favorite meals the first week to make it seem like it was the same and slept on the floor with them the entire week since I took the week off from work. It's just a post about crying uncontrollably in public unexpectedly. That's it.  Just like my life blowing up before my eyes, I never expected this to either.  I am grateful for all of you reaching out, even those banging me for posting and asking for sympathy points.\n\nI know I can do this because so many of you said it could work and that you also did, suffered far worse, are deep in it right now, and shared incredible stories about making connections with your parents because of it.  I am grateful, really, today is my actual birthday in real life and I've been sitting here reading posts and dying all over again.  I'm lonely, but not alone.  Thank you all. I will pay all of your gratitude forward.\n\nI am truly  sorry for misspelling Inside Out in the title, I fixed it here, but everything seems hyper vigilant right now.",

            "Oh god. \n\nHey look. I\u2019m 12 years post-divorce. Our kids are now 17 and 20. They\u2019re doing great. \n\nIt\u2019s ok to let them know you\u2019re sad, and confused. It\u2019s ok for them to see you working hard to create a new stability. I\u2019ll even go so far as to say that it\u2019s ok for them to see that you and your ex are having a hard time getting along and are having hard feelings toward each other.\n\nThere are just two rules to follow: \n\n1. You both must always let your children know you love them and love spending time with them, no matter what. \n2. You must never badmouth your ex before your kids. It\u2019s ok to say, \u201cmom and I have a lot of hurt feelings now\u201d or whatever. It\u2019s okay to be factual. But don\u2019t badmouth their mom. \n\nAnd then rule 3 is don\u2019t force them to confront your dating life yet. Whole other conversation and this is too fresh for you now, but keep that at arms length for a while. \n\nTL;DR: do your best to model healthy grief and constructive rebuilding while shielding your kids from spite.",

It sounds like you and your family are going thru a very emotional time, and I hope it works out well for everyone.

They are what we, in truth, really are.\n\nFuck that material stuff we fill our lives with, it\u2019s other people and how we interact with them that in the end really matters. And considering what you are all going through - as hard as it might be, it might in the end be a good thing for everybody - I think it was a good moment for you and your children, in materializing the change you are all facing right now, in the end together. No need to be embarrassed by that.",

You Will make it through and survive. I hope your children will help you through it and bring you closer to them in the process. It doesn't help to keep stuff bottled up and hidden from your kids, be transparent and work through it.  Keep moving forward and get out all your regrets and emotions when you can. Your family while maybe broken in your eyes now, will grow to be stronger. Your kids will learn from it and improve their adult lives from living through your experiences. Good luck and hope all goes well for you and yours.",
            "Hey buddy. I love this story so much. Let me tell you why.       \n\nMy parents divorced when I was 17. My life was in a tail spin right before this, due to us moving to a cramped 1.5 bedroom house with a 5 person family and a sibling who was spiraling into hardcore drug addiction. I was the youngest. I grew up watching my siblings have the perfect family life during their teenage years. Then I get to mine and it was like everything was fucked. I had so many feelings of bitterness and loneliness surrounding me. A few months later it was just me and my dad in that house. My family never recovered. If anyone asks, I just tell them it\u2019s me and my dad. 90% of my friends don\u2019t even know I have a brother, sister, and a mother who are each living their own individual lives. It\u2019s been a rough life growing into adulthood without them. I have so much pain remember the life I had as child, which was the perfect nuclear family, to the one I have now, which is feeling guilty if I do anything at all that adds to my fathers loneliness on holidays.     \n\nBut you know what amazing, beautiful thing happened during all this? Me and my dad have the worlds greatest, in breakable bond. Forged in fire and pain and all these horrible feelings and yet it came out shiny and new and wondrous. It\u2019s full of emotion and love and tears. I\u2019ve never felt a love and understanding like the one I have for my father. He\u2019s the greatest man I know. Every good thing I am in this life, is because of him and from him. I am in tears writing this. And you know the one thing since I was a child until an adult that we have always had, that has grown more of a thing for us in the last decade than others?       \n\nSeeing films together. Just sitting quietly, experiencing a beautiful artform. Even at its worst. It doesn\u2019t matter. The movie, itself, does not matter. It\u2019s being able to sit next to my dad. Share a giant tub of popcorn. Drink a massive Diet Coke. And just spend time with himself every few movies I notice a few more gray hairs, a few more wrinkles. And the older I get I\u2019m just as thankful to notice them and have one more film together.      \n\nYour kids will love these memories. All the jagged edges of them. Especially the one where your son ate a dirty piece of pizza. Love them hard and they will surely love you back tenfold. :\u2019)",
            "I know the movie, it's extremely smart and touching. It's an explosive demolition for your emotions disguised as a cute kids movie; to get that unexpectedly and in such an emotional background that's just *brutal*. Your story had me tear up in sympathy.\n\nBut on the other hand the movie is insightful AF and it peovides both a starting point and a lingo to have some very challenging conversations with your kids. I wish you the best.",

Her aunt was with us and mentioned that when she was 3, right after her parents divorced her dad had taken her to that movie and sobbed the entire time. \n\nIt\u2019s so important that you\u2019re showing these emotions to your kids but even more important that you\u2019re not just getting in the car and pretending it didn\u2019t happen.

            "I think as we get older we start to forget just how healthy it is to give ourselves a good cry every now and again, and keep putting on a brave face, especially when going through such a life changing event. Inside Out is a wonderful movie to show that. Feeling sadness is perfectly healthy, all of your emotions are as long as they're kept in check.\n\nWhen Inside Out first premiered, I was going through one of the worst depressive episodes in my life to date. When this happened, I felt nothing, was apathetic towards everything and everyone. There was no joy, no anger, just absolutely nothing I was on autopilot basically all of the time, only dragging myself somewhere when absolutely necessary. Ended up seeing Inside Out on whim because I hadn't been out of the house at all besides for work and my brother wanted something to do. \n\nSeeing Riley's emotions realize they couldn't make her feel was like the movie turning a huge, unflattering mirror right at me. Much like you, I absolutely lost it right there. First emotion bomb I'd had in weeks. A lot of contemplation of why and what I was feeling happened slowly over the next few days. I can't say things were fixed overnight, but that movie did show me a few things on just letting me feel what I'm feeling.",
            "I teach a course on Emotion in Psych / Neuroscience, and I teach a specific unit in which we watch this movie in class and explore the theories of human emotion that play into the movie. This means that once every semester, I have to watch this movie in public with all of my students, choking back my own tears because I\u2019m the prof. It\u2019s SO HARD. It\u2019s a powerful, wonderful movie.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry it went down that way, painfully and in public, but your children learned wonderful things about emotional vulnerability and resilience from you. That grief was healthy for them to interact with and understand, especially because you talked it out with them afterward. You did great.",

            "When I was a child and my parents divorced, a very *very* similar thing happened the first time we went out with my Dad. I was very confused and uncomfortable about it at the time, especially in that moment, but: it actually made me feel really good about my Dad. I had always seen him as a stern (but not mean), \"larger-than-life\" guy. It wasn't until he broke down in tears that I realized: he is an actual person, and he feels all those emotions just like I do. It not only made me feel closer to my Dad, but it also made me feel better about myself. I came to realize that all my emotions were ok, and that if *he* was going through all of that too: then it must be normal.\n\n30+ years later and I honestly feel I would not have as good a relationship with him now if that hadn't happened. I certainly can't guarantee that your kids will feel the same about it, but it certainly sounds like you genuinely care and that you are doing your best.

And it\u2019s like pouring salt when you\u2019re feeling raw. This perhaps is why this movie is used in therapy for autistic children, to help them express emotions. So you did what others have felt it did to them as well. \n\nSecond - and most important for where you are right now with yourself and your children... the one thing that helped me the MOST was a simple scene from a Netflix romcom Man Up... \u201cYou are an emotional jigsaw at the moment, but you\u2019re gonna piece yourself back together. Just start with the corners, look for the blue bits.\u201d\n\nSo for yourself... Find your corners, and simple swaths of your emotions to put back together first. No need to rush it. \n\nAnd for your kids... Please just find simple routines that you can carry out with your kids. The only thing kids need is to know that BOTH parents love them beyond anything else, and that there IS a routine in their schedule/life no matter which home they may be at that week. \n\nGood luck my friend!\n\nAnd one more thing... when you have the money and inclination, buy that big TV and speakers.

I'd never really seen my dad cry before then. He then apologized and we talked and went out for food. Parents arent meant to be unwavering, emotionless walls, and divorce can break someone. Your kids will never hold this against you or judge you for it, from what I can see you really just wanna do the best by your kids and love them, love spending time with them.

Parents have emotions and struggles and I'm guessing it was, in a way, relieving for them to see you express such emotion over a situation that has undoubtedly been confusing for them.

You didn't sign up to be a single parent but here you are and you're figuring it out. There's a huge learning curve!

            "Ok... OP, I had almost this EXACT same experience 5 years ago, during my separation, where I'd rekindled a huge crush from high school. It also ended, right before the release of Inside Out and I mistakenly thought I'd be able to handle it. Sure, big man, sure. \n\nThat said, things DO get better. My relationship with my ex is actually reasonable, I'm in a new relationship with someone amazing, and my kids are doing GREAT! \n\nI won't say the usual \"keep your head up!\" crap.

            "Oh, no, Honey, you totally did not FU.  I think you made the best \"mistake\" you could ever have.  Your children were hurting, too, and most likely hiding it, because they thought they were supposed to.  Seeing their dad feeling all his feels opened the door to actual communication.  Most parents will hide their pain over a divorce \"for the sake of the kids\", but they're not really doing their kids a favor.  And good on you for letting them talk, and being honest with them.  You created an environment that is safe for them, and will bring them closer to you.",

Parents act like they\u2019re supposed to have everything together all the time and that makes it weird for kids to understand things. \n2. Men especially are taught never to show emotion and we all see how that\u2019s been going.\n\nSo even though it may have been weird in the moment, your kids seeing their male parent breakdown is in it\u2019s own way, good.

It allows your son to see that men have feelings and can/will experience deep emotional pain. It is important for children, across the gender spectrum, to see emotional pain and struggles. The important thing is to have a conversation about it, because having an open and honest discussion will allow so much growth, whether that's internally for your kids, your self, or your relationship to one another.\n\nOn another note, I'm very sorry to hear about your struggles.

I don\u2019t remember it all that well being so young, however there is one standout memory I have which is when my father had taken my sister and I to McDonald\u2019s, and I think he was talking to us about moving on and starting to see other people and buy a house etc. \n\nI distinctly remember him pointing to the other single dads with their kids in the restaurant and telling us he didn\u2019t want to be one of those dads that only see their kids in places like these on the weekends.\n\nIt was important to him that he move on with his life and be happy, because that in turn will make the times we spend with him happier. And he was right, we spent most weekends with him and my eventual new stepmother and had happy childhood memories with both sets of parents.\n\nI\u2019m a father now, and only in the last few years do I realise how fucking tough it was for my mother to raise us in the weekdays as a single parent (she never settled down with anyone else). Good luck with your new chapter in life, and know that however much sadness and struggle there might be right now, in time your kids will be fine and will adapt, and you\u2019ll create a new, happy home and new memories.",

I felt the same was as you did...\n\nPeople kept telling me \"Dont cry in front of the kids, be strong for the kids\"\n\nYet I realized something, if the mother is not crying, and I am not crying, then the kids dont see that this is actually a SAD thing that is happening.  They will grow up to feel like neither parent showed emotion during this.\n\nInstead, I started to allow myself to cry in front of the kids when I felt it coming.  (Obviously not all day every day like I felt like doing) but I did allow myself to cry a bit in front of them.  \n\nI feel like this did two things\n\n1) Showed my kids that MEN CAN CRY, and its OK  \n2) Showed them that separation/divorce is a sad thing, and its OK to be sad about it.\n\nYou sound like a great father, and I hope things work out well for your new future, and I hope you get to see the kids 50% of the time.",

When I was a kid, maybe 12 or so, my paternal grandfather died. I remember watching Marleu and Me with my brother and dad. At the end of the movie my dad broke down emotionally (it was a very emotional movie, for anyone who hasn't seen it). My brother and I both cried with my dad. We talked about memories and such. It helped me see my dad as human and helped me process my grandfathers death.\n\nLikewise, when my mom died a few years ago, there were several moments between different siblings and my dad and I where we just cried together. It's awkward and embarrassing having boogers and ugly sounds come out, but it is very restorative. Very healing. While I appreciate my dad's strong moments, his \"weak\" emotional moments where the ones that helped me the most. Let me know it was okay to feel things and cry them out. I've done a lot of crying in my life, and while not fun, those are the moments that help me process things and move on. \n\nSo don't look at it as a FU, it's just an experience you guys had together. Remember that your kids are also feeling all sorts of feelings from the divorce and separation. Talking about it and seeing that it is okay to feel the \"bad\" emotions is important for them too.",

The past few days have been very hot where I live (around 30\u00b0C on average), so I left my window open and didn't shut my door. My baby brother was playing with his toys in the hallway and didn't seem to have a care in the world. My mum called me to prepare lunch since she was quite ill so I obliged.\n\nSo I was busy boiling the pasta and making the sauce when my gut instinct told me to just peek out to the hallway. I checked and he wasn't there. *Probably watching TV or something*, I thought and I didn't think much of it. I was about to return to my duty when I froze in my tracks.\n\nYou ever get that sick feeling that twists your guts so hard you know FOR A FACT something so horrible and catastrophic is about to happen? In an instant, I found myself teleporting right outside my room and there he was by the window. He somehow used my bed to climb onto the heater and sit down near the edge of the window.\n\nThe upper half of his body was dangling out and he was busy throwing his toys and being fascinated at how far they can fall and break. He was THIS close to falling to his death, crushing all of his fragile bones.\n\nWithout thinking, I quickly grabbed him and put him out of harm's way and I started hugging him tight while cursing myself repeatedly. My mum was oblivious to what was going on the entire time. I shut the window, closed my room and sat him down with me while I resumed making lunch. I was in shock.\n\nMy brother could've died today. All because of one stupid mistake I've made. Even though I've saved him, I still feel sick and disgusted at myself and this whole incident is playing on loop in my mind currently.\n\n\n\n**TL;DR: Made a huge mistake leaving my window open when I was asked to make lunch, brother somehow got to the window and nearly fell out.**\n\n\n\n\n\n***EDIT: I've just woken up around 30 minutes ago and checked my Reddit.

We went on vacation to Florida and when we arrived at our rental house, we began unpacking - carrying things from the car to the house - but being sure to close the door every time to keep my 3 year old special needs child and my sister-in-laws year-old twins who had started to crawl inside.\n\nNow mind you, my child hadn\u2019t yet figured out how to turn doorknobs in our own home, and yet on this day of all days in places of all places, he figured it out. And at some point during the unpacking, we looked around and realized he was gone. Door bell immediately rings just as the panic sets in and there are two construction workers escorting my son back to us. Not sure how they figured out which house he belonged to, but apparently they found him wandering down the middle of street.\n\nAfter thanking them profusely, I just about threw up. All one million bad things that woulda shoulda coulda happened went through my mind. The fact that he was returned safely is nothing short of a miracle.\n\nNeedless to say, we immediately ran out to Target and bought child-proof doorknob attachments. I still have nightmares were the outcome is much different. Someday it will be a crazy story we tell,  but even a year later, the woulda shoulda coulda haunts me.",

I was terrified I grabbed him and ran in the house hysterically crying even though he was perfectly fine. My mom ran down from the top floor because she heard what was happening she made sure my brother was ok then started comforting me, I felt nauseous, I didn't want to be comforted, she said it wasn't my fault, that I had done the right thing when the glass shattered but I should have asked for help. that's when I realized I had several large shards of glass sticking out of my feet because I ran through the multitude of glass when going outside without noticing. thank god my little brother was ok.

The moms were inside dealing with food while the dads were outside watching the 10+ kids in the pool. I was in the house laying on the floor inside an empty room cooling off and being alone, just staring at the ceiling thinking about nothing, and like getting hit by a bus I got *exactly* that feeling. **Imminent. Guaranteed. Doom.** I got up in a flash, ran through my house, outside, and over to the deep end of the pool. I looked down into the water in a shaded bend of the deep end and there she was, a toddler's hand was just under the surface of the water reaching up to me. I reached in and pulled my 2 year old cousin up and out. Her eyes blinked a few times, went wide, she coughed a bit, and then started crying. Four dads, including hers and mine, were sitting in chairs 10 feet away and never saw anything.\n\nShe was VERY hard to see. She wasn't floating on the surface, she was sort of bobbing upright a few feet under, in a dark and hidden part of the otherwise bright pool. I ran right to and looked right to the spot where she was, quickly enough after she fell in that she had only inhaled a small amount of water.

Today you saved your brother, and that\u2019s what matters and you learned a lesson.\n\nYou should try and convince your mother (or your landlord) to put child guards on the windows though, if only because you saw the post of some random guy on the internet who TIFU\u2019d today and saved their baby sibling by THIS much and that got you thinking (or you could make up a hypothetical case about a guy whose toddler sibling was old and curious enough to open a window and luckily was found on time).\n\nFor myself I have to say, I once went to the mall with my parents, I was about 6-7 years old and tired so while my mom stood outside a store I pulled away and sat with my little legs dangling UNDER the railing. The bottom of this railing was high enough and I was skinny enough that I could have easily slipped through, the only thing keeping me in place was the first slat of this this railing holding my torso and my arms and head peeking over it. I even remember *swinging* my legs like it was a freaking ride while looking DOWN at the people going under me, no less. \n\nIt was probably just a couple minutes but it felt like forever to me. My mom managed to slip quietly behind me, grab me firmly by both arms and yank me so *ferociously* I was confused for a while and wondering WTF happened. Then she lost it on me. Now, my mother is one of the most graceful, collected, calm and understanding person I know; I only remember her berating me 3 times and 2 of those were for fighting with my then-youngest sibling. This was the third. Seeing her like that ensured I never did that again. I don\u2019t resent my mom; I can\u2019t imagine how she must have felt then.\n\nTo hear my aunt tell it: I was super sneaky as a child; they\u2019d see me quietly playing in a room, but in a blink I had already gone and done some mischief (the one I remember: I liked switching salt for sugar lol). My sneaky ways almost got me that time.",

Thankfully, neither of us had any major bodily injuries\u2014cervical sprain for sister, moderate concussion + whiplash for me, and scrapes + bruises for both of us.\n\nThe accident itself was unavoidable.

It didn\u2019t help that my mom, though she *said* she didn\u2019t blame me for the accident, did hold some blame over me.\n\nI don\u2019t remember how long it had been after the accident (thanks, concussion!), but my sister and I had a heart-to-heart where I expressed this guilt and blame I had.\n\nHer response?\n\nShe never blamed me or felt that I put her in danger. She never thought I could\u2019ve \u201cdone better\u201d or avoided the accident all together. She made it clear that it wasn\u2019t my fault, and that I shouldn\u2019t hold this stuff over myself.

Yknow, that \u201cI\u2019m not a kid anymore!\u201d thing... so after slicing the apples up I left the paring knife on the edge of the cutting board which was on the edge of the counter top (the counter was quite tall for me) and went to rinse the sliced apples.

            "I had a similar experience with my little brother when he was 2 and I was 12. The attic in the house I grew up in didn't have a completed floor. Most of the floor had a large board placed over the sheet rock, but there were spots that you could fall through. One such spot was right as you would enter, you would step over the uncovered sheet rock and onto the board. The floor below this spot was concrete, as this attic was over the garage. One day my parents asked me to grab a box out of the attic for them. I opened the attic door thinking I was alone and walked in. Immediately after stepping in I heard a crash and my little brother crying. He had been silently following me and had fallen about 10 feet on to concrete. It just so happens that an old box TV sat right under that hole. He landed on the TV before hitting the concrete. The EMS said that the TV broke his fall and saved him from severe trauma or death. It changed the way I carried myself for the rest of my life.",

            "Hey man shit happens. Let me tell you a story according to my parents when i was a toddler. When i was i think either 1 or 2, my parents and i lived in a trailer. My crib was in my parents room. My parents also liked to sleep with the window open. My mom one day went to go put me down for my nap so she took me to my crib, put me inside tucked me in, and went back to doing house work or whatever she was doing. Apparently i had other plans. Some how, i managed to get out of my crib, walk over to my parents water bed, climb up on top of it, and crawl to the window. Unfortunately for me though, my parents didnt have that gut feeling lol and i crawled out the window. Now im not really religious so i dont know if you want to call it god or a guardian angel but some how, i fell out of the window and the only thing my parents can think of as far as what happened was that i did a complete front flip mid air and landed on my butt. After i fell out the window, my mom was in the kitchen and hear a faint crying. According to her she looked and my dad and said \"OH MY GOD, PAUL,DAVID FELL OUT OF THE WINDOW!\" and i guess my dad straight usain bolted through the whole trailer jumping over toys and whatnot and when he got outside i was perfectly fine lol not a bruise or a scratch on me.",
            "Don\u2019t feel to bad, nothing bad happens and all big brothers fuck up in some way.\nTake me as an example.\nI caught my brother falling but I broke his leg when i grabbed him, fell at an awkward angle on his leg.\nI feel like shit still, this happens 10 years ago now.\nOh or the one time I nutmeged him on a trampoline with my head.\nGave him a bounce boost and the little shit flew higher than expected.\nAnd his dumb ass decided to spread eagle on the way down and boinked his share of the family jewels dead center of my forehead",
            "Such a European thing. Glad your bros safe but there is this thing called a window fly screen. I can\u2019t imagine any window here in sunny southern CA that doesn\u2019t have this. Perhaps look at installing one. It keeps the bugs out",
            "I had a similar experience. I used to live with a family member and my niece almost hung her self she was a terrible little rug rat and loved to climb on stuff. well they had this table that was near a window this thing was kinda cool cause it had these parts that folded out to make it longer and these hinges to lock them up right. well the problem was it was old and cheap if you put anything lets say 10 to 20 pounds on the flaps the hinges would go and the parts that folded up would collapse back down again. anyway i had a bad feeling about something and got up to check on her i saw to my horror that she was standing on the middle of the table all tangled up in the wire that you pull to open the blinds it was around her neck and if she would have taken a step on this thing to one of the flaps it would have dropped down and she would have hung he self. Its weird sometimes you get these hunches and they save lives.",
            "Honestly, not your fault. I once was one and have a baby brother, and I can tell you that they are overly curious of everything. Sure it's better if you close your window, but it's twice as better if you have a little gate around things they can climb, or that are dangerous for them.",

        "selftext": "This TIFU actually happened today! Or at least in the last 24 hours, either way I\u2019m counting it. \n\nI\u2019ll be the first to admit that my feet are sometimes a little bit smelly. Some of my friends and family have lovingly said they are \u201codorly challanged\u201d. I wash them in the shower every day, I\u2019ve tried the fancy creams, but none of it seems to really help and I\u2019ve at this point accepted that I\u2019m just naturally a stinkfoot and will live my life with a constant faint corn chip aroma wafting from my toes.\n\nI live alone, and when in my apartment prefer not to wear socks or shoes. This is occasionally a point of contention with my girlfriend, who visits often and insists I at least wear socks when she comes over. Its mostly fun banter where she teases me for my feet smelling and I tease her for a loud burp or something like that, but sometimes after a particularly long day the foot factory releases emissions that would surely get me fined by EPA, which she rightfully hates. \n\nYesterday she came over for dinner. It was a nice day so we decided to get delivery from one of our favorite restaurants and eat on the balcony. Well, I\u2019m at home and I\u2019ve already liberated my tootsies from their foot prisons, and I figured it\u2019d be nice to set the table with some flowers for my lady. I was outside setting up when she arrived, and she came outside to greet me. IMMEDIATELY she smelled my feet and recoiled in disgust. The most dramatic reaction ever. Fake vomiting, fake crying, she was hamming it up as part of our banter. I HAVE gone a bit nose blind to them over the years, so I lean against the railing to balance and go to smell them myself to see how bad they were. This was my mistake. I\u2019m a burly guy, and this poor railing could not handle my equally overdramatic reaction of throwing my head back and screaming. It gave way.\n\nLuckily I\u2019m only on the second floor, so I only fell maybe 25 feet, but it felt like it lasted a solid minute. It was at least long enough of a fall for me to reflect on the situation and feel like an idiot for dying from smelling my own feet. The aftermath is a fractured rib and dislocated shoulder, and my girlfriend never letting me live this down. \n\nTL;DR: smelled my feet, railing went yeet, almost died and I feel like sheet.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nEdit: Okay guys, I appreciate the foot health advice but please stop PMing me weird remedies. I\u2019m not going to pee on them or soak them in a tomato-bleach medley. I will go back to to the doctor though once I\u2019m all healed up!",

            "On top of treating a likely fungal infection with a topical cream, here's some tips to prevent it from recurring:\n\n* Get new shoes & new socks, the fungus you've been dealing with has invaded those and will just recolonize your toes if you go back to your old footwear.\n* Foot powder with tea-tree oil.  Lush makes one called T is for Toes I use when I wear closed-toe shoes w/o socks.  There are probably other similar options at the market, especially at a natural foods store.\n   * If rubbing the foot powder into your feet everyday feels like a chore, you can also sprinkle some into your socks before putting the socks on your feet.\n* When you get home, wash & dry your feet!\n* Set your shoes outside somewhere (patio or garage) to let them dry out before you put them back in a shoebox.\n   * Please use a shoebox to store your shoes, having a closed container will help keep your bedroom / closet / home from smelling like your stank ass shoes.  Feel free to slip crumpled newspaper in them to absorb extra moisture, or use a half dryer sheet to help them smell better.\n\nThank you for coming to my Ted Talk.",

Guard rails are meant to stop people from falling and absolutely should have been able to support your weight leaning against it. I wouldn't be surprised if this triggered an inspection of all balcony railings at your apartment complex. I've seen countless apartments replace balconies and their railings over the years due to water damage, it's a fairly common occurrence.\n\nWhile I'm not advocating for you to sue your complex, you'd absolutely have a case for them to cover your medical costs and lost wages at a minimum. Up to you whether you'd want to, but I'd retain a lawyer and absolutely wouldn't sign anything brought to you by your apartment complex trying to absolve them of responsibility. Don't even talk to them or say anything more than \"I leaned up against the railing and it gave way\".\n\nThe real fuck up here is the lack of adequately safe railing on your balcony.

I'm sorry man, i've not once had foot odor become a common point of contention. If your feet have become a meme in your relationship, well just like stereotypes the baseline comes from a common truth. She likes you enough with it, but it IS an actual issue.\n\nSee a doctor about it. No joke. Without knowing anything about it, you likely have a toenail fungus. Regardless of that, if you ever want this girlfriend thing to go beyond that you have to change yourself and start becoming a socks guy. Buy/make a footwash station and wash them when you get home. It may seem excessive, but to make a comparative example if you were someone that excessively sweats a lot you wouldn't come home with a completely soaked shirt, and i meant 100% all over damp, and just change the shirt while basting in your residue. If those two fails or are too \"hard\" to start getting into the habit of then start keeping baking soda around the house and just douse your feet in them. Probably not the best for your skin but you gotta do something.",

Your expenses should include medical, damage to property, and lost wages.",

Showering as soon as he got back from class. Fabreeze spraying, getting a timed scent sprayer, baby powering his feet every morning and night.\n\nNothing helped.

        "selftext": "Obligatory this happened a few weeks ago.\n\nMy husband and I have been together for 13 years. I have no idea how this started really, but I've been powdering and rubbing his balls for years now. It is just something that we do. It's weirdly comforting and puts us both to sleep. Plus, who doesn't like freshly powdered balls instead of gross swamp balls? Not to mention the wonders it does for chafing.\n\nAnyway, one day I can't find the powder for our 2 yr old's butt. No biggie. I go to the store to get more, but I figured I could get Man powder too. A nice smelling one that just smells like... Man. NOT the after work gross man smell... this is what we are trying to get rid of my dudes. So I get a new powder for him and just regular ol' Johnson's for the baby. It'll be a nice surprise for when he comes home since he's been working out of town.\n\nHere's my fuck up...\n\nI DID NOT READ THE LABEL PROPERLY. I saw that it said \"Absorbing. Cooling. Refreshing.\" I saw that it said \"...odor + wetness control...\" and just thought of how awesome it would be for him to not have swamp balls. Being a bit of an airhead, it did not occur to me to read further into that.\n\nSo fast forward a few days later to when husband finally comes home from working out of town. Night rolls around and we're in bed. My husband asks for Powder and Ball Rubs. After a full week, without his wife to powder his balls for him, I say \"no prob. I got you, boo.\" I bust out the new Men's Essentials Man Powder. It smells good. I dig it. I turn around to put it away and he asks me what I put on him. I turn back to him and can see he's clearly uncomfortable. I look at the label and see that the cooling effect comes from menthol. Now, I feel awful at this point, but honestly, I can't stop laughing. He's complaining its like IcyHot so I tell him to take a shower and see if that works. He hops in the shower and washes his balls. Nope. He is still feeling it. I'm still laughing at my poor husbands predicament that I created by trying to buy him something new for his balls. I ended up using the Johnson's on him, but he was still uncomfortable. I felt pretty bad about it, despite laughing like a hyena the entire time.\n\nThat night he said I should post this here, but I wanted to surprise him so I've waited. I do still powder his balls when he's home. I am going to stick with Johnson's Baby Powder though.\n\nBabe, if you are reading this, I am very sorry for causing your balls discomfort, but it was so damn funny. I love you. Sorry for being an airhead some times.\n\nTL;DR TIFU by powdering my husband's balls with powder that made him feel like he had IcyHot on his balls.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate: First of all, those of you who awarded my weird and wholesome post are the real MVPs here. I humbly thank you. When I made this post, I had no idea it would blow up like this. Made my day reading most of these comments, but then again the comments are usually where its at. Some of you really need to broaden your horizons and just caress those balls because they need love too. My husband does manual labor so yes he gets shweddy balls. He showers and asks for powder. I have had his penis in me, had his children, I really don't think touching his balls is that far out there. And you all have opened my eyes and educated me on the dangers of talcum powders. I have been looking at new things to try instead of J&J Baby Powder. I thank you for that and I'm sure my husband's balls will too. ",

            "I\u2019m a little late to the party, but here\u2019s a perspective from a male GYN:\n\nI try to defuse awkwardness as much as possible in what\u2019s inherently an awkward exam in the awkward setting of a doctor visit: \n\nKeep conversation very dry and clinical but understandable. \u201cI am going to collect a vaginitis swab to check. For any bacterial imbalances, but your pap was normal last year and you\u2019re not due for another 2 years, so I\u2019m not collecting that today\u201d. \n\nTalk people through the exam and what to expect, whether they\u2019re relatively new to GYN exams or already know what to expect. \u201cThe speculum should cause pressure but should not hurt. Let me know if you feel pain, that\u2019s a sign of something not normal.\u201d\n\nUse lame jokes liberally and never use double-entendres. \u201cI\u2019ll have you know that us OBGYN\u2019s see lots of socks, and you have a good style sense with socks!\u201d\n\nI definitely would have taken the OP\u2019s comment as the GYN took it. I likely would\u2019ve responded the same way, possibly because the implied lack of intercourse might be a sign of a medical problem (hypoactive sexual desire disorder). The doctor\u2019s response was another medical history question. I\u2019m sure it made for a good laugh later and he probably remembered the exchange that afternoon but would\u2019ve forgotten by next week. More than a few awkward things happen daily in the GYN\u2019s office, we\u2019ve seen it all!

I am an awkward person that uses jokes to make me feel comfortable with those types of situations. And my doctor gets it. He laughs.

            "If it makes you feel any better OP, I have a sort-of related story:\n\nIn the country where I live it's usual for nurses do various checkups for things like thrush/BV/STIs etc (OBGYN referrals are for stuff that needs further tests).  So I'm at the nurse because I had a recurring issue.  She has a look, takes a swab, diagnoses thrush, then asks me since she's down there do I want an STI test.  I say sure, why not.  This test involves some new finicky thing that takes a sample from the vagina, so the nurse is riiiiight up in there face to face with my bits while she's fiddling with it getting a sample.  I don't really mind because she's a nurse and she's seen it all before.\n\nAfter all that's done, the nurse asks me to wait for a little bit so she can double check with my doctor about something.  I say I don't have too much time because I'm going to a funeral in an hour, and she asks what time and where.  When I told her, she asked if it was \\*name of my grandmother\\*'s funeral.  Long story short, the nurse is my cousin once removed.  We're both like \"Ohhhh hey fam\" and then at the exact same moment we both look at each other in horror when we remember she had her face inches away from my genitals 2 minutes prior.\n\nShe was also my asthma nurse so I had to see her several more times after that.  I think we both found it a bit weird.\n\nAlso, I don't think you fucked up, I think your story was funny!",

            "Honestly, as a male gynecologist, none of the small talk we make with you really matters. We barely remember different patients, that's why we make a note at the end of each visit. Your gynecologist likely doesn't even remember this interaction. It's just something you remember. Definitely not a big deal. We've seen sooooo much worse, it wouldnt even cross our radar.

Perhaps one of the patients before you was concerned about their lack of sex life and that\u2019s where this Dr. \u2018s mind went at first. In any case, any OB/GYN worth seeing will have their thoughts focused on you and your health and well being and what you say will be interpreted through that lens rather than their office decor.

So they are technically married when I first meet them. \n\nOne day... I'm having a consultation, they bring a child, maybe 8 years old, and we put him in front of the office tv while we talk. Again not uncommon for courthouse marriage couples to already have kids together.\n\nThe meeting goes well and they write me a deposit check. The check has both their names on it and the last names are the same. \n\nMy brain does maths and I figure... Joint checking account + same last name + kid in tow = they are already married so I say...\"You two are prepared, you already have new checks printed with the same last name.\" To which the bride to be replies... \"I'm kinda still married to his brother.\" And she ended that story with \"...most of his family doesn't approve.\"\n\nI was mortified and tongue tied not knowing what to say next as we continued to plan a wedding between this little boys Mom and his new \"Uncle Dad\" as he watched cartoons in front of my TV.  \n\nTL;DR ask couple if they were married as they hired me to be their wedding photographer and the answer was no, she had the same last name because she was still married to his brother.\n\nEdited to fix a typo.",

        "selftext": "Obligatory this happened last night. Also obligatory, I\u2019m an adult male, and I\u2019m 100% sure this was an accident. TLDR at the bottom. \n\nSo I\u2019m taking online piano lessons with a teacher that I\u2019m well acquainted with. They\u2019ve been going smoothly. I\u2019m already used to zoom because I finished my semester of school on it anyway, and I figured this would be a good time to reunite with my instrument. \n\nwe switched up the times for the recurring lessons a week ago, and that caused some confusion as to when last night\u2019s lesson was to begin. He sends me a zoom link and a text at around 5pm and I thought the lesson wasn\u2019t until 5:30pm, so instead of texting him, since I was sitting there giving all of my assignments a final practice run through anyway, I just clicked on the invite link and opened zoom to ask if it would be okay to wait thirty minutes. He says it\u2019s fine, so I leave the meeting and close out of zoom. \n\nI spend the next twenty-five or so minutes practicing, and decide, \u201ceh, close enough,\u201d and open the email with the same link again. What\u2019s the harm in being a few minutes early? \n\nThis is where the fuck up happens. \n\nI figured he\u2019d have closed out of zoom as well, but apparently, he\u2019d just left the meeting running, but had forgotten about it. He must have been viewing another window. But his webcam didn\u2019t know the difference, of course. And as soon as I connect, I\u2019m greeted with a spectacle I can\u2019t immediately make sense of. \n\nHe\u2019s standing up in front of his computer, the camera cutting him off right above the neck, and right below the waist, so all I can really see is his torso, but his hand is below the camera, and he appears to be...jerking it? My mind does a bit of an acrobatic feat for a moment. He knew I was logging back on within the next couple minutes. Maybe he\u2019s just Fucking with me. \n\nSo I say \u201chey, man!\u201d And he doesn\u2019t respond. His hand just keeps going just below the cutoff of my view (thank god), but that\u2019s when I notice, just at the bottom of the camera, where his shirt ends, it\u2019s just skin. And the control panel at the bottom of the screen isn\u2019t so much cutting off the action as it\u2019s merely blurring it, and it\u2019s all skin color. He didn\u2019t reply to me, so my audio must be going through headphones he\u2019s not wearing, and if he doesn\u2019t have zoom open at the moment, he has no way of knowing I even signed on. So I just leave the meeting. \n\nI sit there in silence with my jaw dropped for a moment, wondering what I should do. I paid for this lesson. I want to keep taking them. Is this even a big deal? Can I just... get over it? Make like it never happened? Should I even tell him? \n\nA minute later, my phone buzzes. He\u2019s texting me that I can go ahead and join the meeting again via the same link. Oh, don\u2019t I know it. So, I hold my breath, and click the link again half expecting to be faced with another display of masturbation, but no. He\u2019s just sitting there with pants on ready to begin the lesson. \n\nSo I put it out of my mind, had a very productive lesson (though the thought reoccured to me a few times), and as soon as we are logged off, I VERY carefully turn everything off, and burst out laughing. I saved this laughter up the whole time. I couldn\u2019t stop laughing for five solid minutes. \n\nI couldn\u2019t decide if I should tell him or not, but no. I think not. To me, it\u2019s just funny. Really funny. I can handle the hilarity, but if I were him, my humiliation would be beyond reckoning.\n\nTLDR; rejoined a zoom meeting a few minutes early and caught my music teacher jerking off.",

            "As a music teacher who went online at the start of the pandemic, this is the nightmare! Personally, if I knew I was going to be teaching in a few minutes, that would not be my chosen time to do anything similar to what your teacher did, but I\u2019ve still had paranoia about accidentally broadcasting whatever significantly more mundane activities I\u2019m getting up to in my studio while I wait for my students. \n\nHOWEVER, that\u2019s what the \u201cWaiting Room\u201d feature is for\u2014 to ensure that meeting attendees can\u2019t connect until you\u2019re ready. Your teacher should already know that, but I wonder if there\u2019s a way to bring it up stealthily, in order to bring it to his attention, as another commenter suggested.\n\nI would be cringing at the idea of bringing up what happened, but my biggest concern is this: what if this person teaches children? Most piano teachers do, and if this had happened to a kid or their parent, he could be in real trouble. Jerking off in his own home is perfectly fine, and I\u2019m sure he had NO INTENTION of doing it in front of you or any student. You seem blessedly chill, and for your teacher\u2019s sake, thank goodness. But if this had happened to someone other than you, whose ultimate reaction wasn\u2019t just laughter in the face of awkwardness, it could have huge consequences.\n\nIf you like your teacher as a person and want to give him a heads up without the awkwardness, maybe share a hilarious story you heard from a \u201cfriend\u201d about some horrible Zoom accident. It can be somewhat more innocuous than what you witnessed, but pick something embarrassing that has to do with one person not being aware of their visibility on a video meeting. He\u2019ll immediately think of his own activities when in front of his teaching setup, and if he\u2019s at all smart or careful, will start being much more careful, blocking off his webcam, and set up the darn waiting room.

I honestly think the only decent thing is to put your own feelings of discomfort aside, and tell him.  If you think there is any chance this dude could do this again and you want the best for him, then advising him of his lack of understanding on how the program works is the only right thing to do. I would personally say something like \"I am not really sure what I saw, but I could tell it wasn't intended for class, and before I risked intruding on a private moment I decided to d/c but I thought you'd like to know just in case....\" That way you are off the hook but he KNOWS what you think you saw, but he gets to believe you didn't really see anything.

            "Fucking hell that made me laugh!",
            "Just wanted to chime in here as someone who takes testosterone injections:\n\nTestogel is as \"effective\" as IM cypionate, but is far more prone to user error.  It's daily instead of weekly like injections.  It's also much more expensive and is less likely to be covered by insurance.  Not only that, but if you come in contact with where he puts the cream, you will also absorb it.\n\nSecondly, it's odd that he's being told to inject into the ventrogluteus.  The most commonly recommended site for IM testosterone is the vastus lateralis.  This is a location that he can inject himself without issue.  He may want to bring this up with his doctor unless there is a reason why he was advised to inject in this location.\n\nNow, to allay some of your needle concerns.  He is very likely injecting with a 23g needle.  Needles are made of stainless or carbon steel and are flexible at this size.  Go ahead and *try* to break one.  You'll find that they just bend and require quite a bit of pressure to do so.  You would have to actually cut it off in the skin to get it \"stuck\" in there.  At that point, it wouldn't go anywhere.  A 1\" needle isn't going to somehow hone in on a blood vessel and cruise through the bloodstream.  It'll stay right where it is and you can apply pressure to the surrounding tissues until you can see the end and remove it with tweezers.  But again, it wouldn't happen to begin with.\n\nOnce they get his dosage stable, if this is something he's going to need long term, there are other options such as subdermal pellets that are implanted in the upper buttock area.  They last for months, so no more shots.\n\nGood luck to both of you!",
            "I'm a trans man, been plunging inch and a half long needles in my legs once a week for over 5 years.\n\nWhether it's a subcutaneous or intramuscular injection (like me!), he can and should do these injections himself. It doesn't have to go in his buttcheek. I inject into my quads, alternating left and right each injection.\n\nIf you want self-injection pro tips to pass along to him, pm me, I have a TON of great tips to make it as easy and painless as possible. I've never had a problem (other than the rare soreness) in all my time.",
            "Thanks for the laugh :)\n\nIf needles make you that uncomfortable though, he could learn to inject himself. It\u2019s not terribly difficult, I was on injectable antibiotics intramuscularly for a few weeks at the start of the year (pneumonia) and since my husband is super squeamish about needles I learned to inject myself (upper thigh area). The first time I felt a bit squicky but I got used to it pretty fast.",

I knew my ass was burning so I didn't even think about it NOT being in my butt. We called my doctor, and they said to go to the ER.\n\nI was like, there's got to be a better option, so we called around and an urgent care center said they would be able to remove it ($100 is way better than $500+ and I figured it would be faster), so that's where we went.\n\nGot there, waited an hr, then got taken back, laid down on my belly and proceeded to get my ass checked out by 5 different people (all women of course), meanwhile my wife is in the corner bearly holding herself together while they poke and prod my ass looking for a broken needle. \n\nAfter another hr of this, and a ton of x-rays... they still can't find it. Then one of the nurses looks at the packaging that the syringe came out of (my wife brought it with us to show them), they realize it's retractable.\n\nSo 3 hrs later, 5 females playing with my ass, and my wife totally frazzled from the event we are finally able to load up and head out on our trip.

Everyone will tell you that's too small and the testosterone won't go thru, but it will.\n\nUsing that needle, it's easy to do it yourself, sit with legs relaxed and use the muscles on the upper leg (outer half, between hip bone and knee, 3/4 the way closer to hip bone so you are in that giant muscle).\n\nYou'll really have to push the plunger hard and it will be slow, but it won't hurt.  I might get a little pain 1 out of 5 times, resulting in a little soreness for a day or two, but that's it.\n\nAlso, be prepared for ball shrinkage, and realize that it's likely he'll be on this forever. When you replace at high levels, the testicles stop working and atrophy. \n\nThe good news is he should feel better within a couple weeks. For me, my levels were literally lower than the average female. Now I'm at around 700 total testosterone which is high for my age.\n\nAlso, be aware, it can produce \"roid rage\". His temper may be short. You can control this by adjusting the dose over several months. Make sure he's getting tested every 3 months. They should be doing CBC tests and also prostate level tests.

Doing it in the thigh is pretty quick and easy. You're actually not supposed to do it in the butt since there's a large nerve that runs through it. Middle of the quad a bit to the outside is safe.\n\nSecond, he doesn't need a 2in needle unless he's morbidly obese (which could easily be a reason for low T). He probably doesn't even need a 1.5in needle. I've had better results with a 1in vs 1.5.\n\nThird, you didn't specify this, but please make sure he's getting 18g needles to draw it, and 22 or 23g needles to inject it. I've stuck myself with an 18g without thinking and it hurts like hell.\n\nAnd, if all else fails, he can probably just hop over to his doctors office to have them give the shot.

Sometimes I psych myself out really bad and focus too much on the action- I've found that listening to music, especially a favorite song or an earworm, on repeat can help me calm down if I focus on the lyrics and don't overthink the shot itself. \n\nSwift movement in, pull back and see if there's any blood, if not press down the plunger, swift movement out, and you're done!

I started doing the shots myself so I had more control over how and when it went in. Did it in either of my upper thighs. Bit of a pinch going through the surface, then painless getting the rest in. It's important to draw the Plunger back a bit and be sure there's no blood going into it, that you're not injecting into a vein or something. Only thing that bothers me now is that initial little pinch as it goes in, other than that it's not that bad!\n\nAlso, I've had the problem where the T seems to leak a bit from the injection hole.

He should massage the area after & be active, so it flows. Best time is at night when levels are low. Creams & patches may be easier for application, tho can do more harm to the partner thru normal body perspiration. \n\nAlso - very important: cholesterols & estrogen levels need to be closely monitored. Synthetic testosterone causes major increases in both. Addition of meds to block both will counter the side effects. Learned the hard way over the years. A good endocrinologist is well worth it!\nBest of luck :)",

She opens the door and goes, \u201cDid you say something about Santa Clause stealing penises?\u201d\n\nI reply, \u201cI didn\u2019t say any shit like that. I would NEVER ruin Christmas.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how we got there:\n\nI have two daughters and a son. My son was 3 or 4 at the time. He refused to wear clothes and ran around naked or in his underwear. My daughters weren\u2019t having any of it and were like, \u201cThis is your department, old man. Do something.\u201d\n\nI tried to reason with my son and that just didn\u2019t work. I was thinking that I needed something to use that he was afraid to lose. He\u2019s a tiny kid. He\u2019ll play with a cardboard box and be happy. \n\nThat\u2019s when he came running past me with both hands on his junk. That\u2019s it. He loves his dick. I love MY dick. Me and my penis are tight. \n\nSo my son and youngest daughter are eating lunch. I look across the table and go, \u201cHey big guy, you know how sometimes you can\u2019t go to sleep cause you think there\u2019s something in your closet?\u201d\n\nHesitantly, \u201c... yes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to scare you but you\u2019re old enough to know now.\u201d\n\nHis eyes got wide and my daughter had a puzzled look on her face. She\u2019s 4 years older. \n\nI go, \u201cThere\u2019s a goblin that lives in your closet. And if you don\u2019t do what you\u2019re supposed to, like wear underwear and clothes, he creeps out at night while you\u2019re asleep and steals your penis.\u201d\n\nHe incredulously responds, \u201cNAH AH.\u201d\n\nI reassure, \u201cOh yeah. What do you think happened to your mom and sisters?\u201d\n\nAt this point my youngest daughter loses her mind laughing. She\u2019s holding her sides and almost falls out of her seat. \n\nMy son was dead silent. I could almost hear him thinking, \u201cDamn... they don\u2019t have dicks.\u201d\n\nSo where does Santa Clause come in?\n\nAfter I told my wife I would never ruin Christmas, she tells me she heard our son say to our daughter, \u201cYou must have done something really bad for Santa Clause to steal you penis.\u201d\n\nMy guy confused Goblins with Santa somehow and thought Santa Clause was roaming around with a big red sack full of stolen dicks. \n\nFear not. I straightened him out. I googled pics of Santa and pics of goblins from the movie Labyrinth. \n\nTLDR: Tried to scare my son into wearing under wear and he ended up thinking Santa Clause was stealing dicks.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ViftZTfRSt8",

Everyone was having a good time and I was ranting, loudly, to my friend about how so many guys had struggled to take my bra off. I don\u2019t have huge breasts. I wear a standard 2 clasp bra so I was annoyed when guys fumbled around with it. Sometimes they couldn\u2019t even get it off and I had to take it off. Then I decided I needed to try it myself so I yelled \u201cJohn come here. Let me put a bra on you so I can take it off and see how hard it is\u201d. I ran upstairs to get one of my nicer bras that I usually wear on dates and put it on him. I struggled for a while and then realized it was a lot harder than it seems especially since I\u2019m doing it at a different angle. I had to eat crow and now I\u2019m fully impressed when a guy can get my bra off with one hand, or even at all. And don\u2019t mind when guys can\u2019t get it off and I have to do it myself because that shit is hard af.\n\nTL:DR- bitched about guys not being able to take my bra off.

            "LMAO dude thank you for this post. I'll end up deleting this 'cause I had a happy hour earlier and am admittedly pretty wasted but this post is just cracking me up making me remember high school.\n\nI dated this girl in high school for a bit and got to join their group of friends. I was one of like 2 emo kids senior year, but there was this group of sophomore emo kids and one of the girls had taken a liking to me. We started dating for a bit and I ended up in their friend group...\n\nAnyway, it was a true mix of guys and girls, straight up 50/50, and very incestuous... they all had dated eachother or at least had hooked up at some point. As an older (almost 30) guy now, I actually think that it was super weird 'cause everyone was so young doing that but that's another matter.\n\nAnyway, the guys in the group had a game they'd play... the group would hug often and the guys would try to sneakily unhook the bra if they were hugging one of the girls. Being new to the group I felt the need to fit in and _stole one of my mom's bras_ and would practice on it by myself.\n\nI ended up getting pretty good at it, but I never lived up to 2 of the other dudes in the group. They were like bra wizards, I swear they could just unhook a bra just by looking at it.\n\nThat said, I've never been praised for my epic bra unhooking skills, so reading this post brought me back to some good times many years ago. I've never had a problem unhooking a bra after all that, but honestly like /u/deadmonkies said in the top post... I can only do it one handed and left handed lmao. Any other way is a trap I swear.\n\nAnyway, I'm old and rambling. But thank you for reminding me of a good time. Life has been miserable recently and it's nice to remember better times sometimes. Overall life is probably better but those fleeting moments are just so damn nice to recall to remember that depression isn't everything.",

        "selftext": "This happened last night. Put a tampon in around 6pm and went about my evening activities. I had a busy night, but at the end of the night I got to see my boyfriend. Totally forgot about the tampon and we had sex. I have a pretty light flow/low key periods due to an IUD, so between that and my busy day I totally forgot I had a tampon in. \n\nWe wake up this morning and I remember. My stomach drops. I immediately go to the bathroom and I can't feel it. Its gone. I tried switching positions, squatting, had my boyfriend try, everything I could think of. Nothing. After close to a half hour of trying, hoping, and praying to the Vagina Gods, I accept my fate. This shit is GONE. \n\nAt this point I'm worried that I'm never finding this thing and it's going to be stuck inside of me forever. I also know the risk of contracting TSS if I keep it in much longer so I know I need to get it taken care of sooner rather than later. After class I'm off to our Student Health Center. I go to a small college, so the doctor is only in for an hour a day. I strategically timed it so that I WOULDN'T see the doctor-- he teaches one of my classes, Gen Med, at night once a week. I wasn't keen on having my professor dig through my vagina to find a lost tampon, so I was hoping the nurse could do it. \n\nNurse is very nice and reassuring but says I have to wait for the doctor. Great. Some time later I'm in a gown, in the stirrups, waiting for my professor to come in, just full of dread. He comes in and is super friendly because he knows me from class, which is the last thing I wanted. Really wish he would have just stayed silent at this point and pretended that he didn't know me. \n\nHe starts the vaginal exam and the following exchange occurs:\nDr, to the nurse: \"well, she got some pretty good news last night\"\nMe: \".........\"\nDr: \"Theres no final in Gen Med!\"\nMe: \"..oh\"\n\nI for real thought he was commenting that the sex was good. Don't get me wrong, it was, but that was even more mortifying than being in the stirrups, naked from the waist down, having my professor look at my vagina. \n\nHe finds the tampon after 5 long, agonizing minutes of searching. I have his class in a few days. Not sure how I'm going to look at him. I'm a 4.0 student and I've never felt more stupid in my entire life. \n\nTL;DR: forgot I had a tampon in and had sex, losing the tampon. Had to go to the health center to get it removed by my professor, who is also the campus physician. \n\nEdit: i was dumb enough to say \"stupider\" instead of more stupid, as many of you have pointed out. Its been a long day, ya'll. \n \nEdit 2: turns out \"stupider\" was fine. Lesson learned: those terms are interchangeable, trust your gut. Also, take your tampon out before sex. \n\nEdit 3: wow, I didnt really expect this post to blow up like it did. Thanks for making a story about my vagina make the front page, guys. \nFor those of you asking, it ended up near my cervix. It was too small/deep for me to have much success getting it myself, because when you lean forward to do a self-exam, the vaginal canal tightens. \nThanks for the supportive messages, I didn't realize this was such a common problem. Makes me feel a lot better, lol. ",

Eventually, after a while of no success, she just told me to not worry about hurting her and to just get it out.

Stupid has two syllables, so it becomes \"stupider\" or \"stupidest\".\n\nFor example, \"big\" becomes \"bigger\" or \"biggest\"; \"pretty\" becomes \"prettier\" or \"prettiest\"; \"explosive\" becomes \"more explosive\" or \"most explosive\".\n\nSome two-syllable words (like stupid) can be used either way (stupider or more stupid), but both are technically acceptable.\n\nSo, anyone who claims that \"stupider\" is incorrect grammar is, well, stupider than you.  ;-)",

Don't forget the pickles.\" \"Oh and if the day care has an extra jar of pickles I have a five in my wallet\"\n\nYeah.\n\nSo anyway, we can't keep up and eventually she graduated to those giant pickles at one point, they were the ones that only fit like 5-7 in a jar, and that thankfully slowed her down to one a day or so. But one fateful day her craving kicks in hard, she couldn't remember when she wanted, nay, NEEDED pickles this bad, and so she dips in for pickle #2 and after chomping that one down goes about her day.\n\nAbout an hour later she gets super sick and starts throwing up, feeling like she's been totally drained of life. We take her to the Dr, doctor says her sodium levels are through the roof and asks what she ate. We checked the label after we got home, I don't remember the exact number, it could be 500% or 5000% or something like that, but each pickle was like 2 servings and each serving had an insane % of her daily sodium. Girl was about to turn into a raisin Cinderalla style. \n\nThankfully mom, baby were fine.

        "selftext": "For the record, I have no problem with this post getting downvoted or buried.\n\nYesterday one of my ex's friends contacted me. She said she got my number from my ex. Made sense. I blocked and deleted my ex's number since our recent break up, so if my ex wanted to continue communicating with me, she had to get creative. Hence, the friend. She said my ex wanted to meet for coffee and clear the air. The friend made it sound like my ex was really sorry for what she did to me. My head was telling me to save my energy and avoid meeting my ex at all costs, but my heart was telling me I used to love her at some point and maybe hearing her out would be the adult thing to do. I decided to ignore what my head was warning me not to do and agreed to meet with my ex. \n\nMy ex and I saw each other this morning. It became very clear very quickly that she had no intention of apologizing for what she did during our break up. She wanted me to know that she found my Reddit post on TikTok. She showed it to me. It got a lot of attention. She reminded me how she had to find out from another person that I was planning to end our relationship and now she had to find out on TikTok that I shared our private life with strangers on the internet. I said well at least I didn't go down on a random girl moments before kissing someone I supposedly loved. My ex said she involved another person (the guy whose dick DNA was in my mouth) because I invloved another person (my friend that I spoke to about the break up before the break up). \n\nI got frustrated and said I guess that made us even. My ex disagreed. She said if she wanted to get even, she would have to post her side of the story on Reddit or TikTok. She was saying that to low key threaten me, but I didn't care, she didn't scare me, not until she said she might \"accidentally\" refer to me by my name and surname and username on social media. I said nothing would stop me from making the same \"mistake\" and dropping her real name too. She said \"challenge accepted\" and dared me to drag her name through the mud so she could do the same to me, but apparently worse. I called a time out and asked what the fuck she wanted. She insisted that I created another post. You're reading it right now. I was instructed to type the following words from her verbatim: \n\n\"I kissed you after sucking someone else's dick to teach you what someone with balls actually tasted like because you obviously had no balls to tell me it was over between us. We're both to blame for the bad break up, but I blame you for most of our relationship problems because you were under the impression that being an introvert meant I was in charge of communication. I confessed to sucking another dude's dick when I was done making out with you... and guess what? I was still doing all the talking! I'm not perfect, but at least I told you what was going on instead of keeping my mouth shut.\" \n\n\"You can hate me all you want for using a random guy with a random dick to hurt you. However, you've been using me since the beginning of our relationship. I was good enough when you wanted to lose your virginity and enjoy all the perks of having a girlfriend, but as soon as you became more sexually experienced, you realized relationships actually required work. I'll admit, I'm a lot of work. But so were you. Dating a virgin guy with literally zero relationship experience meant I had to take the lead in and out of the bedroom, which wasn't always easy and enjoyable, but I did it because I believed you were worth it. I was wrong. You're just a little boy with a big appetite and a small stomach. Fun fact, you didn't make me cum as much as you think you did.\" \n\nThe end. There you have it. I'm the bad guy. I've done my part. I agreed to share this post if my ex agreed not to turn this into a name and shame game on Reddit or TikTok or whatever. I guess this is the price I had to pay for sharing my relationship drama in the first place. Fuck up number 1 for 2023. Fml.\n\nTL:DR Told Reddit (anonymously) that my ex sucked another man's dick before she kissed me and broke up with me. My post somehow ended up on TikTok and got a lot of attention, including the attention of my ex, who then confronted me and made me create this follow up post to share her side of the story or else she was gonna reveal my real name on the internet.",

I\u2019d also then go a bit more local and find interesting content from a user\u2019s country or continent.\n\nAnd, because all of the current world events can be so heavy, I\u2019d include something light and fun.\n\nLike the poop knife.\n\nAs soon as I said that, the HM gave me this look crossed between disgust and confusion.\n\n**HM:** The poop knife?\n\n**Me:** Yeah you know, the poop knife! *(while mimicking holding a knife and then doing a cutting motion).*\n\n**HM:** I don\u2019t think I know what the poop knife is\u2026 and it sounds like that\u2019s a good thing.\n\n**Me:** Oh yeah, definitely. It\u2019s a pretty gross story.\n\nYou\u2019d think we\u2019d leave it at that but no. I then went on to explain the poop knife story in detail for three minutes, complete with hand actions.\n\nIt felt like I was having an out of body experience. I could see myself word vomiting and saying the words \u201cpoop knife\u201d over and over. I was willing myself to stop talking about the GODDAMN POOP KNIFE but it was like my brain was locked onto this one topic and I couldn\u2019t think of anything else.\n\nThe entire time, the HM\u2019s face got more and more horrified while I happily talked about users cutting up their gigantic poops. Finally, I came out of my daze.\n\n**Me:** So anyway\u2026 recently, users found out there was another Redditor who ALSO had a poop knife. Um\u2026 and everyone thought it was hilarious that two different people had the same poop knife idea. So\u2026 something like that. *(again, while doing a limp cutting motion with my hand)*\n\nI went on to talk about how I\u2019d show inspirational content, funny content, something cute, and other content tailored to the user\u2019s interests. I thought I was out of the woods but my brain was still stuck on the poop knife.\n\n**Me:** And that\u2019s what I\u2019d do! I\u2019d show content from a variety of sources - something global, something local, and something funny. Like the poop knife.\n\nAgain, I did the cutting motion - it was like I had no control over my body and the spirit of the poop knife had decided to channel itself through me. I tried to move onto other topics but the damage was done. The HM still had this look of utter confusion, doubt and disgust on his face as we both said our goodbyes and tried to move past my shitty stories.\n\nNeedless to say, I didn\u2019t get the job.\n\nTL;DR: I was so nervous for a job interview that I couldn't stop talking about the Reddit poop knife story.\n\n**Edit: a few people have asked some questions so to clarify:**\n\n* The role was in content strategy. I had to demonstrate that I understood trends in popular Reddit content and could generate/curate content that would resonate with users.\n\n* I did the interview last Wednesday but this post needed to be manually approved because it contained the word poop.\n\n* I\u2019m not sure if it makes a difference, but I\u2019m a lady, not a dude.\n\n**Edit 2: oh god - we hit the front page and this is now the first post that comes up when you search \u201cpoop knife\u201d.**\n\n**Edit 3: we did it. I got a job at Reddit.**",

            "\nMy family poops big. Maybe it's genetic, maybe it's our diet, but everyone births giant logs of crap. If anyone has laid a mega-poop, you know that sometimes it won't flush. It lays across the hole in the bottom of the bowl and the vortex of draining water merely gives it a spin as it mocks you.\n\nGrowing up, this was a common enough occurrence that our family had a poop knife. It was an old rusty kitchen knife that hung on a nail in the laundry room, only to be used for that purpose. It was normal to walk through the hallway and have someone call out \"hey, can you get me the poop knife\"?\n\nI thought it was standard kit. You have your plunger, your toilet brush, and your poop knife.\n\nFast forward to 22. It's been a day or two between poops and I'm over at my friend's house. My friend was the local dealer and always had 'guests' over, because you can't buy weed without sitting on your ass and sampling it for an hour. I excuse myself and lay a gigantic turd. I look down and see that it's a sideways one, so I crack the door and call out for my friend. He arrives and I ask him for his poop knife.\n\n\"My what?\"\n\nYour poop knife, I say. I need to use it. Please.\n\n\"Wtf is a poop knife?\"\n\nObviously he has one, but maybe he calls it by a more delicate name. A fecal cleaver? A Dung divider? A guano glaive? I explain what it is I want and why I want it.\n\nHe starts giggling. Then laughing. Then lots of people start laughing. It turns out, the music stopped and everyone heard my pleas through the door. It also turns out that none of them had poop knives, it was just my fucked up family with their fucked up bowels. FML.\n\nI told this to my wife last night, who was amused and horrified at the same time. It turns out that she did not know what a poop knife was and had been using the old rusty knife hanging in the utility closet as a basic utility knife. Thankfully she didn't cook with it, but used it to open Amazon boxes.\n\nShe will be getting her own utility knife now.\n\nEdit: Common question - Why was this not in the bathroom instead of the laundry room? Answer. We only had one poop knife, and the laundry room was central to all three bathrooms. I have no idea why we didn't have three poop knives. All I know is that we didn't. We had the one. Possibly because my father was notoriously cheap about the weirdest things. So yes, we shared our poop knife.",

        "selftext": "This TIFU actually happened today. I should start by mentioning that this is likely a common occurrence. But as it was the first time it happened to me, I totally freaked out. Thoughts of a potential hospital visit for such an embarrassing incident plagued my mind. \n\nAfter 6 hours of not sleeping this morning I (26F) decided to masturbate using a tiny 3 inch bullet vibe. I should mention that the vibration is super intense. I can barely stand it. Everything was going swimmingly, till my phone alarm started sounding. It was annoying and I didnt want to wake my boyfriend so I popped the vibe just inside my vagina for a moment, trying to avoid getting lube all over the bed. Little did I know this was a horrible idea. My vagina turned into a vaccuum like critter and sucked that fucker up in seconds. \n\nWhile vibrating. \n\nAfter about 5 minutes of fishing for it and panicking I hobbled out to the living room where my boyfriend was napping to beg for his help. Turns out it was hooked on my Nuva ring and turned slightly. He was eventually successful in retrieving it, but only after he stopped laughing and saying I told you so (he warned me about this exact scenario when buying the toy). \n\nTL;DR\nMy vagina vacuumed up my bullet vibe and my boyfriend had to fish it out\n\nEdit: it happen again. With a butt plug. While my boyfriend was at work. Fuck me.",

Reminded plenty of people that the vagina is an external cavity and sure, go ahead and have fun with egg vibrators, kegel balls, etc. Thanks cervix! Just use flared base toys with backdoor play obviously.\n\n>masturbate using a tiny 3 inch bullet vibe\n\nMost the time these are designed just with vulva/clitoral use in mind for others wanting to avoid this TIFU. \n\n>I should mention that the vibration is super intense. I can barely stand it\n\nBonus info just for all the other comments talking about their vibrators. So there's mainly two types of vibrators. Ones with high frequency BZZZ type feeling and others with low frequency deep rumbles. The buzzy vibrators can get to be numbing and cause overstimulation in an uncomfortable way from surface vibrations. The more rumbly motors tend to be more comfortable and typically voted more pleasurable from deeper vibrations that travel further, but usually more expensive too coming from higher end brands or what not. To each their own of course, but something to think about next time you're doing some intimate shopping.",

Not many people keep extra of those tiny batteries around. I much prefer my toy that uses AAA because you can get rechargeable and just pop those suckers on the charger.",

I had resigned that there was something wrong with me: probably an old head injury, cancer, new onset of autism, too much tiktok, unchecked ADHD or some other mental illness that would never get fixed. About 5 years ago, I was prescribed amphetamines and even went to  a therapist that treated the issue as anxiety and learning to live with what I was experiencing through mindfulness. \n\nIt has only been getting worse after 5 years, so I just resigned myself that I was going to die soon and learned to live like this for years while just coping the best I can. This got even worse just recently when I had a seizure while I was waking up in the morning. \n\nMy focus been gradually going to shit with me lacking even the most basic ability to follow movies or what people were saying to me in conversation. I even worked with someone that would once told me \u201cI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s something in your head that the words don\u2019t catch...\u201d but she was right. I couldn\u2019t even follow the most basic ability to listen to others or read paragraphs from a page while retaining the main idea. \n\nThe other day, during my morning coffee routine, I decided to take a magnesium citrate vitamin that I found in the medicine cabinet just for fun since it mentioned nervous system support on the bottle.\n\nI cannot begin to tell you the un-fucking-believable difference that happened in under 6 hours. It felt like someone rewired my brain into functioning again. 5 years of brain fog is nearly completely gone. I can follow conversations and follow what is being written down like I did 5 years ago. I did the same thing again today and I feel mentally healthier than I\u2019ve been in over half a decade.

There are many possible reasons for poor focus. Also, magnesium overdosing is a thing, so don\u2019t rush to the drugstore to down a bottle.\n\n*EDIT2: [Here is what I swallowed for anyone wondering.](https://imgur.com/gallery/h3z3Pi0) and the front page? Hi mom!\n\n*EDIT3: (UPDATE: 24 days after this post). I\u2019ve been taking magnesium, vitamin D, D3, and a daily men\u2019s multivitamin intermittently over the last 24 days. After a screening, it turns out that the only outstanding issue presently identified clinically was a \n\n*Vitamin B12 deficiency*, \n=\nsurprisingly. I could have potentially fixed a magnesium deficiency since I felt so much better after taking the vitamins over the last 24 days, but I will never know for sure since I was supplementing while I had to wait 3+ weeks to get tested. It seems more likely that the initial magnesium dose I took in this post had other psychological effects or was entirely placebo to begin with. I have to go and supplement *B12* for a while before I update this thread again with more tests in 3+ months.",

It's Chapter One brand by Zahler (link below).  The back label says 100 mg Magnesium Citrate.  I started taking it in hopes it would help with mental focus as an addition to the Adderall (20 mg extended release) I already take for ADHD. (Other than giving me energy, I find it doesn't help that much.  And previously, I've been on Ritalin, Strattera, and Concerta with terrible experiences and side effects.)\n\nLong before starting the magnesium, I had begun taking GNC Women's UltraMega once in the morning and once at night. And earlier in the week, I started taking Vitamin D3 [50 mcg/2,000 IU] daily, and Omega-3 [100mg] with EPA/DHA[50 mg]/ALA[50mg].\n\nNow I am wondering if adding the magnesium was a \"Straw ... say 'hello' to camel's back\" situation.  As other's have mentioned, I think if I keep taking it, my system will adjust.  \n\nBUTT ... pun intended ... how long does everyone think that will take?

I had knee braces, I got a cane, I was in constant pain when walking. Doctors juggled me around, told me I had cartilage damage, I needed physical therapy, and I spent months doing it to little effect. \n\nAnd then I went to a rheumatologist because the issues were in my joints and my family was wondering if it was early-onset rheumatoid arthritis. They did the blood work and woops, you have 17 units of vitamin D when the healthy range is 30 to 100. \n\nThey gave me a few megadoses, put me on a supplement, told me to stop being a cave-dwelling gremlin (my words, not theirs), and now I can walk normally again. \n\nUnfortunately, the damage was permanent and kneeling causes pretty bad pain, I can't support as much weight on my knees, and climbing stairs more than a short flight or two hurts like hell. \n\nBut hey, I can walk 100 feet without a cane, sooooooooooooooo life is better",

I looked into magnesium deficiency and started taking a supplement with magnesium and potassium, and have been feeling better. The US Healthcare system tends to blame any health issues you have on anxiety, especially if you have any type of previous anxiety diagnosis. My sister has had every textbook symptom of MS (started with visual disturbances during her early 20s, oh and our grandfather had MS) and they always tell her it's anxiety. Refuse to refer her to a specialist, refuse to run tests. I feel like there is just a discriminatory train of thought with Healthcare professionals in the US, intentional or not, concerning folks with anxiety. I've seen my sister having episodes of body cramps, fainting spells, and it makes me sad and it scares the shit out of me. I've even toyed with the idea of flying to another country with her to be seen by a doctor who could try and help us get some answers. She has her masters and can't even work because of how severely her symptoms interfere with her life. I hate the US Healthcare system. Sorry about the rant.",

            "...I don't think magnesium supplements work that fast...Please see a doctor and get some blood work done.",
            "Firstly, go to a licensed medical professional. Preferably a traditional physician. Not an ND or non-evidenced-based \u201cdoctor.\u201d \n\nSecondly, a magnesium deficiency would not be  improved let alone resolved with one single tablet, and you would certainly not see any single-dose improvement with an OTC supplement of unknown potency. (If I were to guess, it was probably a 250-400 mg. tablet?)\n\nThirdly, if you are going to order your own tests, which you can do in some states, or see an actual doctor, you should test for magnesium in packed RBCs (erythrocytes). Nothing else. That is the gold standard. \n\nFourth, you should, as mentioned above, have a complete exam with blood panel outside of this one specific test. That would include CMP14, LFT, CBC with differential and platelets, vitamin D3 (25-hydroxy vitamin D), urinalysis, and perhaps lipids and CRP-hs. Again, only a competent, licensed medical professional should make this determination. A 12-lead ECG would also identify significant electrolyte imbalance if reviewed by a skilled practitioner. \n\nFifth, my opinion only, I think you have anxiety. Typically in patients with what you\u2019ve described is the placebo effect. Some will argue that low magnesium causes anxiety, and while that is perhaps true, magnesium deficiency would not be resolved or even alleviated with a single dose. Plenty of PubMed articles for you to search on there. Research and journal articles are a heavy read, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get through them. \n\nSixth, as mentioned elsewhere, focus should also be given on other minerals as well and ensuring your diet is nutritionally complete from foods not pills. Lean meats, seafood, vegetables, fruits, nuts, real cheese, etc. Ensuring you consume adequate calcium, potassium, and magnesium is just a start. There are other trace elements that should be involved in your diet to maintain general wellness. Again, food sourced, not pills. Pills are used to correct deficiencies, but lifestyle changes need to be the long-term plan.  \n\nAnd seventh, human nutrition is a complex topic that is evolving continuously. Daily recommended intakes are variable and influenced by locale and nutrition agencies in each country. We as a population are occasionally revising nutritional standards. My suggestion is you trust evidence-based science, and not checkout aisle fad books or scare tactics that come up in silly Google searches. I will repeat this again, Google searches are not a replacement for competent medical attention. Nutritional supplements are largely unregulated in the US, for example. And each brand has their own marketing trying to influence consumers why their products are best. And there is a lot of uncertainty in nutrition supplements. The biggest one that comes to mind is whether or not in the case of minerals, the label is providing elemental mineral content or molar mass mineral content. \n\nI\u2019ll close out with this final thought. Don\u2019t overdo anything. Humans for some reason think that \u201ca little extra\u201c of a supplement or pill or tablet will have added benefit. \u201cHey, that low-dose really made me feel great. I bet just a little more will do even better.\u201c This can go wrong very quickly. Especially if you have an underlying medical condition like kidney disease. Thus, it\u2019s important for comprehensive, competent medical care. The daily requirement for some nutrients is measured in micrograms. Like vitamin D3. Daily intake of 10 to 20 \u00b5g is sufficient for most populations. Now, go research how small 10 \u00b5g is. And I will caution you to be very careful in units of measure. People get confused very easily and conflate micrograms with milligrams. And that\u2019s 1000x difference! And people get really confused about the difference between vitamin K and potassium (K). Even med students sometimes mess that up.\n\nWhew. I\u2019ve said too much. I wish you the best on your continued journey of improvement and taking control of your health.",

Being a huge nerd I checked the glove compartment for the insurance and registration info which is when I found a baggie full of weed and a small wooden pipe. I just kinda sat there for a minute, grabbed it and went back in the house and found my dad. I handed it to him, said I didn't care who it belonged to but if I ever got pulled over, the cops probably weren't going to believe the 16 year old girl that it wasn't hers. He just put the stuff in his pocket, kinda shrugged and said, \"it's your mom's for her glaucoma\". Whatever, fine, just don't keep it in the car anymore.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was at a family a dinner awhile ago and I can't remember what someone said but I replied with, \"yeah, because mom has glaucoma\" and my mom goes, \"I don't have glaucoma\" and I, incredulously, said \"dad said you had glaucoma\", in which my dad responds to with, \"what the hell are you talking about, I never said that\". After reminding him of said driving incident over a decade ago he just looks at me and burst out laughing, said he had no memory of that at all and couldn't believe I believed his off the cuff lie about my mom having a degenerative eye disease. I told them I had been writing down family history of glaucoma at every doctor and eye visit I'd been on for the past like 15 years. They just laughed harder.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntldr: I found my parent's weed stash when I was 16, they told me it was for glaucoma, I believed them for almost 2 decades.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: this was my first post, thank you so much for the flair!\n\nEdit 2: sorry for those saying this is made up but I really was (am) just a huge nerd/goody two-shoes and was terrified of getting in trouble.

They each had a pinky on one hand that came out at a bit of a funny angle, it's only really clear when they stretch out their fingers. we referred to them as their 'mental pinkies'. They told me once that one brother was walking along and a dog came and jumped at him and managed to bite his finger, so it healed crooked like that, and then the same thing happened to the other brother, so now they're matching. And I just believed that for years. I don't actually know what happened, or if they were just born like that!\n\nThe other story is about my great-uncle. He's mostly deaf. Our family doesn't know for sure how he lost his hearing, one theory is that when his family was sent to Siberia in WW2, he became seriously ill with some type of fever and lost it that way. But one of my siblings once told me that he got that way because as a kid his brother blew a trumpet in his ear and damaged his hearing. I actually went and retold that story in my high school 'speech' class when our teacher was teaching about reasons for hearing loss. ",

        "selftext": "This happened last night. My wife wasn't feeling well and I was tasked to make dinner. I made a nice penne pasta with sausage to which I inhaled, It was delicious. Right after dinner I started to have horrible lower back pain, to the point of on the ground rithing and nausea which only progressed worse and worse. At this point I had a feeling it was another kidney stone as I've had them in the past. My wife drives me to the hospital and I limp in, in excruciating pain. I check in, the nurse gets my vitals and then I waited for them to take me back to get a CT at which point I start vomiting from the naisea in the lobby... in front of everybody, and falling to the ground because it hurt so bad (think hot serrated knife in your back combined with the feeling of having your testicle in a vice). \n\nThey finally got me back to a room in the ER and the Nurse Practitioner (NP) that was on came in and confirmed what I had thought, it was a stone but it was stuck mid left ureter (The stone was about 4.5-5mm and for referenc, the human ureter is about 5mm in diameter, so a tight fit) she left to go order my meds. The nurse and her nursing student came in and got an IV catheter placed, antinausea and pain meds on board which helped bring my pain down from a 10 to about an 8. About 20 min later the pain finally went away, completely away, so we speculate that the stone pushed its way though and finally dropped in my bladder.\n\nNow here is where the fuck up happened. When the NP came back in she had a very concerned look on her face. \"There are some concerning things on your CT scan and I'm just going to come right out and ask, do you do drugs?\" I told her no I don't to which she asked when I ate last. I replied about an hour prior to coming to the hospital and that I made penne pasta. She stared in disbelief. Come to find out the radiologist that read my CT was concerned that I was a drug mule. Apparently, if you don't chew your penne pasta all the way, the shapes and gas patterns they produce look very similar to a bag of drugs. I told the NP that I wasn't a drug mule, but rather a penne mule to which she starts to crack up laughing, she left the room laughing and I could hear my nurse and a few of the other nurses start to crack up. The NP came back and said that she had to go tell the radiologist that it was in fact pasta and not drugs, the radiologist also started to crack up laughing. \n\nAll in all, i was able to urinate after thr pain went away, no fever or bacteria in my urine sample and since the stone finally left my ureter, I wasn't in pain anymore so I got to go home. The NP was even joking about putting \"make sure you chew your food thoroughly\" on my discharge instructions. \n\ntl;dr: if you don't chew your penne pasta fully and need a CT scan, you might be accused of being a drug mule.\n\nEdit: I also have 2 snapshots of the CT which I don't mind sharing if you want to see the stone or what a true penne mule looks like\n\nEdit 2: by popular request, here are the images I managed to get: https://imgur.com/gallery/tVft1Sm\n\nEdit 3: Thank you for all the awards!",

            "Radiologist here. I don\u2019t think the interpreting radiologist was wrong to be alarmed in this case. Despite what others are claiming, the imaging appearance of drug packing is highly variable. For example, the most recent case I saw was a man who placed a prescription bottle full of pills inside a swimming pool noodle, wrapped it in duct tape, and inserted the whole thing into his rectum. \n\nIn the images provided here, the concern lies in the fact that the penne mimics the appearance of capsules. The fact that all of it remains in the stomach makes it look as though all of the \u201ccapsules\u201d might be enclosed together in a bag of some sort. To me this would raise concern for the ingestion of a large number of pills in a suicide attempt, which I have seen before on imaging, and is obviously something the radiologist can\u2019t afford to miss. \n\nApologies for your nephrolithiasis.",
            "'Cracks knuckles'. Yeah, I'm a nuclear med tech. I'm not 'qualified' to diagnose you but we do review scans before we send them to the radiologist and tell them what we see and what they might want to look for. Whatever tech told the radiologist they needed to look at that scan stat needs more training. I'm serious. Gastric contents (Chyme) look relatively similar to this. Granted this is a little odd but there is no reason and I mean NONE that they should have jumped to the conclusion of you having a shit ton of drugs in your stomach.\n\nActual drug packing is very apparent and in this case I'd say it isn't even something that I'd have thought of. I'd just have been like... yeah dude just ate.\n\nAnother technologist or radiologist can tell me I'm an idiot though if they think I'm wrong.",

        "selftext": "So last week I was in Korea and spontaneously decided to download Tinder a day before I was supposed to leave since I had no plans that day. Luckily I found a guy who was willing to meet up with me that day and we planned to meet for dinner in Seoul.\n\nThen he told me he actually had plans at night but was willing to meet up for coffee. I agreed and we end up meeting a few hours later to grab a coffee. He pays for my drink and immediately we connect and talk for a very long time. He was super sweet and very attentive throughout the whole date. I was surprised that we shared many similar interests. He promised that when I visit Korea again, he'd show me around and made tentative plans. He repeatedly told me he wanted to meet again, which I took as a sign of interest. Since I was returning to Japan, I had no intention of continuing to use Tinder, so I asked for another way to contact him. Since we were in Korea, I figured he would have Kakao Talk (a Korean messaging app), so I suggested that I should add him on Kakao. **First big fuckup.** I added him on Kakao through his QR code, despite never using the app before. Then send a quick \"hi\" message and close the app. After that, I forgot about it and we quickly went back to chatting and banter.\n\nEventually, it came around time for dinner, but neither of us wanted to leave early, and since he had his commitment at 9:00 pm, he suggested we walk around and grab dinner. I agreed and we walked around the streets of Seoul to find a place to eat. We settled for street food and talked over dinner. This time, I paid for the meal, as a thank you for the coffee, and we head back to the station. But since neither of us wanted to depart, we made one last pitstop, and he decided to show me a Korean bookstore. We were supposed to end the date at 7:00 pm, but we kept on pushing it back as we found new things to discuss, until it reached almost 7:30. It was finally time to go, so we walked to the station together. He told me that he was very lucky to have met me and that I should call him when I reached my hotel safely. We agreed to keep in touch online.\n\nWe depart and I get on the train. My hotel was 1 hour and 30 minutes away by train, so 45 minutes in, I decided to spontaneously delete tinder. Since I had this guy on Kakao, it shouldn't have been a problem to delete Tinder right? **Second fuckup**. When I finally reached my hotel around 9 pm, I decided to open up Kakao Talk and message him. I look at our chat log and it was empty. I remember thinking \"*weird, I thought I messaged hi earlier\"*, but I quickly dismissed it and tried to send another message. It didn't go through. So I tested another message, and it didn't work. Turns out, I'm partially banned from Kakao Talk because the number I registered with isn't associated with a carrier anymore. This means I can't send messages unless they send the first message. I quickly go into panic mode and try to contact him through other means. However, I deleted my Tinder account, which was my main way of contacting him.\n\nSo I thought that maybe I should make another Kakao Account with my Korean number and contact him through there. So I uninstall and reinstall Kakao Talk and create a new account. **Third Fuckup**. Clearly I wasn't thinking, because there was no way to re-add him since I don't have his Kakao ID. So I backtrack and tried to log in to my old Kakao Account and just wait for him to message me first. Immediately, I receive a popup notification *\"This account is temporarily disabled\"*. I thought the ban only extended to messaging, but apparently, now I can't log in either. I messaged Kakao Support, and they said it would take several weeks to unban me if they don't find anything wrong.\n\nGreat, so now I guess I unwillingly ghosted my first date. I really put in the effort to contact him again by trying to find other social media, but to my avail, I had no luck. So I guess I will never be able to contact him again, and the whole date was just one big fever dream of my time in Korea.\n\n**TL;DR** : Went on an awesome first date with a guy from Tinder while I was traveling in Korea. We had an immediate connection. I added him on a messaging service and prematurely deleted Tinder since I didn't want to use Tinder when I returned to Japan. I found out I was partially banned from that messaging service and locked myself out of my account. So there was no way to contact him again. Therefore, I unwillingly ghosted a guy I had great chemistry with.\n\n**TL;DR 2** Can\u2019t contact guy I went on a great first date with because I deleted tinder and messaging app doesn\u2019t work.\n\nEdit: clarifications. I deleted my Tinder *account*, I tried recreating an account, but he\u2019s not there. I can\u2019t rematch with him because I\u2019m back in Japan now and I\u2019m too far. He doesn\u2019t have fb or instagram, I tried. And I don\u2019t have a phone number (to save money while abroad in Japan), so I never asked for his.\n\nEdit 2: Okay I contacted Tinder Support\n\nEdit 3: Thank you to all the kind strangers offering to pay for a tinder gold subscription, but I will try to exhaust all my free options first. Plus I would feel bad accepting that kind of aid!\n\nEdit 4: Tinder Support's response: *\" After deleting your account, your account can't be restored but you can create a new account just by logging into Tinder again.* *If you've deleted your account, you won't be able to get your matches and messages back*.*\"* :(\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate: [Found Him!

            "I had a similar problem occur, but with a different dating app. Unfortunately, I dropped my phone, breaking it completely. Sadly, when I got my new one, I never got their phone number. I lost my only way to contact the other person! Shortly after that, I ended up moving pretty far away from the area and 2+ years later, I found myself on the same dating app. Coincidentally, so was their friend (whom I had never met before).... What were the odds?!?! Somehow, that friend and I managed to cross paths (it wasnt like tinder where you need to swipe to see them. You can actually message people and view locals in your area). Apparently, the person I was fond of, told their friend about me and when the friend saw me, they instantly had to reach out to reconnect us! I was so worried I was getting catfished, but the friend had a really great heart. The friend reunited us and 4 years later, my partner and I are still together. Funny how life works!

I'm disappointed because the fact that she immediately just said okay and got ready to go makes me think I misread some signs, but then just before she leaves she comes back and says \"can I give you my number?\". Awesome, that never happens to me. She enters her info on my phone, hands it back and tells me to call her soon, pretty good night.

If yes, you can put his initial in it, and if you know full name and surname, or if you remember the place where you two had coffee together, you could try to contact them and put also a small notice or ask that they try to talk to him if he ever comes back (if they remember).\n\nI also think if you post in the korean subreddit and in the one of the city you were in, you might up the ante and receive help and advices from the locals.\n\nThe reason I suggest not relying *just* on Tinder support (as they might still help in some way), is that I had a problem where I suddenly lost all matches I had (and I had way more than I expected to have after traveling in February), all of a sudden and with confirmation from many of them that it looked like I had suddenly unmatched after I spoke on insta and whatsapp. No refund was given to me from the Tinder Gold subscription I had wanted to try, nor any other action was done while I patiently waited for updates. They will probably just offer you to buy a subscription and hope for the best, focusing on getting money from you without using any other mean they (might) have, which is a behaviour I genuinely dislike in matters of love and relationships.\n\nWish you the best of luck, please don't give up!",

We met through an app similar to Grindr. We meet up, hook up, end of it. Never met again. Around 2 weeks or so later I start dating this 20 year old girl. Things are going ok and about 3 weeks in the relationship we are walking through a park when she stops me and tells me that her dad is there and I should meet him. It's a bit soon, sure, but it's not like formal or anything so I agree. Lo and behold though, her daddy is the dude that was calling me daddy a few weeks back. We both freeze and stare at each other in absolute horror not knowing what to say. We awkwardly shake hands, girl attributes it to nervousness. 2 weeks go by and one day she calls me to meet up. When I get there she is absolutely fuming. Like, I can literally see smoke coming out. She goes off on me about how could I possibly do this to her. I obviously have zero clue what she is on about. She tells me that her dad came clean to her and her mom about being bisexual and told his daughter, my gf, to break up with me so he can be with me. And apparently it was my fault because I was the one that turned him gay. So she throws a plastic container at me and storms off. Never heard from any of them again.\n\nTL : DR I meet up with a bisexual dude for an one off, start unknowingly dating his daughter, dude comes out to his family, gf blames me for turning him gay, breaks up with me\n\nEdit 1 : seriously thanks for the awards guys. Never thought I'd get awards on here.\n\nEdit 2 : in case it wasn't clear yes, I am bisexual as well\n\nEdit 3 : I am a man, not a woman as many have thought. I thought that banging a bisexual dude would make it clear \ud83d\ude02",

He is very high functioning but has the mental capacity of about an 8 year old.\nAnyway this patient is very fixated on the fact that I am pregnant. He asks me every time I'm with him if I've picked a name and when I'm having the baby. \nToday as soon as I walked in the door to his house he says \"I know you had sex\" I am a little shocked by this and don't say anything. He follows up by saying \"I know that how you got pregnant.\" His mom is upstairs so I'm stuck navigating this by myself. (Important to the story) So here's where the FU comes. I said to him \"you're not wrong but sex isn't something you and I should talk about together. It's something you should ask your mom about.\" I had completely forgot this kid has an extreme fear of doing anything wrong and took my comment as he shouldn't have said that to me. I thought the conversation was over and done with but then Him, His Mom, and me all get in the car to go to school. \nAs soon as we are all stuck in the car together he very nervously yells \" THE NURSE AND I TALKED ABOUT HAVING SEX TOGETHER.\" Now, as a nurse I've seen and hears many awkward things but this one takes the cake. I very awkwardly had to explain to his mom the situation and no, I did not talk about having sex with her mentally challenged son. She thought it was hilarious but I'm still mortified.\n\nTLDR: the mom of my mentally challenged underage patient thought I talked to him about having sex together",

            "This story reminded me of a moment I still kick myself over. When I was 14 I worked at a roadside produce stand. There was no cash register (cash only) and although I could use the calculator on my phone, I was pretty decent at mental math and you quickly learn the typical denominations ppl would pay with and the change you'd owe them. Anyways, jump to the hottest week of summer when 9 hours into a shift a lady pulled up and ordered a TONNE of produce. Im talking a quarter of what I had, around $80 worth while most just get a dozen ears of corn and go on there way. As I was digging through my float trying to make up the change I said \" I'm sorry I'm just wayyy too hot to do math.\" Eventually I looked up and she was just glaring at me like I was the most conceited prick she'd ever met. I immediately realized my error but being adolescent me I was totally tongue tied until she was driving away. Thanks for the trip down memory lane OP.",

        "selftext": "As the title says, I am currently fucking up by being in my girlfriend\u2019s room. \n\nYou may be thinking she\u2019s here with me, scared to be caught, but she\u2019s not. In fact she\u2019s nowhere near me, because she\u2019s at school.\n\nMy girlfriend and I live about an hour away from each other and she has school so you can imagine seeing each other is not the easier thing right away. My girlfriend also lives with her parents, and she\u2019s Asian, meaning no boyfriend until college (though her mom seems okay with it).\n\nOn Wednesday we developed a plan to have me sleepover her house without getting caught. The plan was simple, I would come when her parents were gone at work (they own a restaurant) and I would leave in the morning when her dad takes her to school because her mom would still be sleeping.\n\nIt went great, I made it out, even ran to my car which wasn\u2019t necessary because by the time her dad was coming back I was driving out of her neighbourhood. \n\nFast forward to that night and I end up going back over. Thursday goes good, I go to her room in the morning and end up going back to sleep until she comes home. \n\nNow it\u2019s Friday morning. Her dad almost caught us because he wanted to take the recycling out but she quickly got it for him. Then she leaves, I lock her bedroom door and settle in her bed where I\u2019ll be for the next 7 hours waiting for her to come back. \n\nHer dad comes back, comes upstairs, tries to open the door. Fuck. It\u2019s locked. He pauses, turns the light on, I assume he looks in her brother\u2019s room, then tries the door again. Still locked for obvious reasons he does not know about. He says something to himself (I don\u2019t speak Chinese but I really wish I did), then goes back downstairs where he sleeps on the couch.\n\nI text girlfriend, almost dying because of how scared I am to get caught. She tells me to chill, tells me they don\u2019t have keys to their doors, the only way to open it is to take the handle off. She texts her dad, saying the doors locked and she can unlock it later, he says okay. Her dad doesn\u2019t always listen so that worries me.\n\nPretty sure her dad went back to sleep now, and her mom isn\u2019t awake. Now I\u2019m currently laying in her bed wide awake, texting her, asking my parents what to do (have had similar experiences and got caught), and trying not to freak the fuck out because I can\u2019t do anything.\n\nEscaping is impossible. Her window has blinds and a screen and is second story. Going downstairs and out the door is foolish, her dad sleeps on the couch and the stairs are noisy. Plus I have no idea what time her mom wakes up.\n\nI have no choice but to sit it out for the next 7 hours, maybe try to get some rest but I doubt I will. Anyone have any advice? She\u2019s 19, I\u2019m 20, her parents don\u2019t even know she has a boyfriend.\n\nI imagine they\u2019ll be beyond pissed if they find out I\u2019m here, we\u2019ll both be fucked. Not only is she dating me but I\u2019m staying in her house without them knowing. It\u2019s scary to think there could be someone in your house and you wouldn\u2019t even know it, I feel bad for doing this but I love my girlfriend and I\u2019m literal melted butter in her hands.\n\nUpdate: probably should have gotten up with her right away but chose to stay in bed... now I have to poop really badly. About 6 more hours to go though. Rip my bowels and my asshole. Also for some reason everything in her house fucking creaks, so I have to be very careful with what I do on the bed, sleeping position wise.\n\nUpdate 09:54 am, about 5 more hours: I still have to poop, not as badly though. However a new probably has arose. I grabbed a hard boiled egg earlier when her dad was gone, two baby oranges, and a piece of Hawaiian bread. I ate the egg obviously because I can\u2019t really eat all day, and most of one of the baby oranges, and two bites off the little square of bread. Tummy feels a bit weird. Hope I don\u2019t throw up because it\u2019s very hard to be silent while your guts spill on the floor. Also think of napping but too afraid I\u2019ll let out a massive fart or make some noise. Girlfriend stopped replying due to class. I\u2019ve given up the idea of escaping a long while ago. The dad is of no concern, pretty mid level threat but low for now. Mom is high level once she wakes up though. Hopefully she\u2019ll leave for work but it looks like that might not happen as she isn\u2019t awake yet and supposedly would leave at 10:30. \n\nQuick update 09:55am: mom is awake and went downstairs, I think she\u2019ll make breakfast or something. Dad is talking to mom, don\u2019t know what about. Hope they don\u2019t try the door again, really feel like I\u2019m gonna shit and throw up now.\n\nGood update 10:03 am: good news, pretty sure the mom just left, pretty sure I can hear her dad snoring. I can finally relax a little. Might actually catch some shut eye. Off to play a bit of fifa mobile and then maybe sleep for a few hours.\n\nOkay another update since it was asked for: 10:20 am, mom\u2019s long gone for sure, dad\u2019s asleep, not snoring but I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s sleeping. Unfortunately girlfriend hasn\u2019t answered texts for the last two hours I think. Finally beat a team in fifa after playing them for the 20th time. Every time the air conditioner turns on it makes this loud ass noise so every time that happens I get spooked. I\u2019m glad everyone is getting a good laugh out of it. Someone thought this post was fake, which is fine. Not really sure how to prove it\u2019s real. As I said before hiding under the bed is impossible, the only place to hide is her closet which will be a tight squeeze. Hoping it doesn\u2019t come to that. Dad will probably sleep all day, as he stays up all night talking to his friends in China so his body is in another time zone. Might just nap when the girlfriend comes home as she usually naps after class. Thanks for the good luck. See you in an hour or when something interesting happens. \n\nUpdated 11:40 am: hello, my girlfriend knows this exists now so hello, enjoy my pain and these comments. So far dad\u2019s still asleep, mom is at work, AC still spooks me. Here\u2019s some answers to questions: gf\u2019s birthday is late, yes dad works but \u201che can\u2019t handle work\u201d so he goes later (around 6 I think?), and I\u2019ll make it clear now I\u2019m not planning to escape, it would be stupid. I truly think gf\u2019s dad doesn\u2019t care enough to try and bust down the door. Also yes, Florida is a Stand Your Ground are but dad doesn\u2019t own guns, just knives (I feel like I could run faster, used to play soccer and have been practicing boxing for years and more recently muay thai so I know how to run and fight). To those asking for proof, if you tell me how to upload a pic then I\u2019d have no problem doing that. As for my poop situation, I still have to go but it\u2019s not that bad anymore. Yes I have a bit or orange and bread left, and I have headphones that are supplying me with some nice Spotify service. Also, I played campaign mode in fifa, finally beat chapter 2 after 3 days. See you in an hour. \n\nNot really an update but I\u2019ll post link to gf and I\u2019d texts and her room door (had to reupload bc her face was exposed) [proof reddit](https://imgur.com/gallery/9Pv91je) \n\nUpdate AGAIN: uhhhhh I didn\u2019t see a post that got deleted. I deleted the link to the pic bc it had her face in it, but I uploaded a new pic and posted the link up above. If this shit is deleted then uhhhh what the fuck reddit you wanna fight? As for my bowels, still gotta go but not as badly. I\u2019m probably going to watch some YouTube or Netflix, since sleeping isn\u2019t a good idea. I\u2019ll update in an hour as always. \n\nUPDATE: try using your phone to view. Anyway GOOD NEWS. As we speak I am shitting in the toilet. Dad left. Pooping has never felt so good. I\u2019ll update you when my girlfriend comes back.\n\nUpdate: girlfriend is home, I pooped as soon as the dad left. Yes I know it\u2019s stupid staying longer but now that my girlfriend is home I\u2019m safe. For those who are asking why didn\u2019t I leave when I got the food, there was a very tiny window to do things, and I didn\u2019t have my bag packed. There will be one more update after this when I get home, the true safe zone. As for now the girlfriend and I are going to play fifa and chill until I have to leave. \n\nFINAL UPDATE: hello I am at my house in bed, nowhere near my girlfriend\u2019s parents. I have pooped twice, it went well thank you for asking. About my girlfriend\u2019s age,,, she went to school in China at first, and has a late birthday, therefore she\u2019s making up credits and will be going to actual uni soon. She\u2019s not finished university and gotten a degree, therefore, NO BOYFRIEND. For those of you saying she\u2019s an adult her parents don\u2019t control her... they do. As long as she lives there and they support her financially. Not to mention she isn\u2019t white... She\u2019s Asian (Chinese specifically). I myself am Italian/Cuban, so the same rules go for me until I move out (planning to before the end of next year).  Many of you ask why I didn\u2019t leave when her dad left to pick her up, instead pooping. First off I had to poop so badly. Secondly I won\u2019t see her for awhile, and recently she got hurt so I\u2019ve been helping tend to her wounds so she doesn\u2019t need to go to the hospital (mom\u2019s a nurse, taught me everything since I was young). I wanted to be there for her in person. Also yes, her parents own a restaurant. I won\u2019t post anymore updates (99.9% chance I won\u2019t bc it\u2019s over) but will reply to DM\u2019s and replies :)\n\nFinal permanent update: yes it\u2019s about almost a year later, she broke up with me a few months ago. I\u2019m glad you all enjoyed my pain lmao just wanted to write this just in case anyone comes back to read this and is wondering what happened almost a year later. I\u2019m currently happy, perhaps have a bit of a thing going on with a different girl, I\u2019m mentally and physically better than when I did this stupid shit. I will never do this again, and I don\u2019t suggest anyone else does it, I had about 5 heart attacks throughout the whole thing and it was a shitty thing to do, if I was the dad and found out I would be beyond pissed. Sorry Mr.Ex\u2019s Dad. Yeah, I hope everyone is doing well, I\u2019m doing better, enjoy your day/night :)\n\n\n\nTLDR: currently staying in my girlfriend\u2019s room while her parents are home, doors locked, dad tried to get in, parents don\u2019t even know I exist, no escape route. Also have to shit really badly.",

I freak out and think about where to hide. My options were hide in the bathroom or hide under the bed.

He eventually left and went back to bed.   \nSo, I proceed to try to leave when I notice there are police lights out the window. I look outside and the police have pulled someone over. I wait and wait for them to be done, but for whatever reason the cops hang out talking after the person they pulled over leaves. I get fed up and I sneak down without them seeing me, only to have the cops finish talking and get back in their cars. One of the cops sees me and since it was 3 AM, he proceeds to pull up next to me while I walk home.

            "Convinced you are myself right now. I\u2019m M 20. This is crazy close to an experience I had this past summer. You seem bored, OP, so i\u2019ll tell you my experience:\n\nI was seeing this girl (F19) for a few months. She\u2019s never had a boyfriend and her parents are crazy religious and protective over her, so having a boy over for the night is absolutely unheard of. We develop this plan that\u2019s absolutely *foolproof* /s\n\nGirl lives an hour and a half away from my house, and a half hour from the airport. therefore the airport is 2 hours from my home. I needed to go to the airport saturday morning to pick up my brother, so we got the great plan that I stay over at her house so I don\u2019t have to drive 2 hours at the ass crack of dawn. I drove to her town during the day, we spent most of the afternoon and evening together. Went to dinner, saw a movie, etc. Come around 23:00, she knows for a fact her parents went to sleep. We quietly open the front door and walk down the hall (past her sleeping parents room) to her room just down the hall. Got in bed, and just slept. Nothing sexual happened at all, we literally just cuddled all night. Or, at least, almost all night because I kept waking up out of fear that someone would come in. There was no lock on her door.\n\nCome 7:00, she had warned me her parents get up early for Saturday work, but never come to check on her. We both lay extremely silently as we hear her parents moving around, not 10 feet away from where we were laying. Dad does to kitchen. Mom follows. Thinking we were safe, I slowly get off the bed and change clothes, then lay back down. Must\u2019ve made some noise or mom got suspicious. Slowly to my horror, the door creaked open just a tiny bit.. someone looked in... then it closed again. Me and my girl laid there in complete astonishment. Fuck. \n\nCue my heart racing at a million miles an hour, repeating \u201ci\u2019ve got to get out of here\u201d like 1000 times in a whisper.  Maybe she didn\u2019t see me. Maybe i can still get out of here. I start gathering all my shit in my backpack as quietly as I can. I wait until I hear both parents walk away to the kitchen, then fling open the window and leave, as per our incredible original escape plan. I chill in the bush outside her window for a bit before making a break for my car, parked at the end of the driveway. I open the trunk with my key and lock myself in it. I didn\u2019t want the sound of my car starting and then driving away after her mother saw a boy in her bed. That would be all the more suspicious. I wait for a text from my girl, she says her mom is in the shower now, that it\u2019s the best time to leave. I bolt out of the trunk, hop in the car, and drive away. Still wearing my PJs.\n\nHere\u2019s to hoping you have a better experience, OP. Keep us updated \ud83d\udc4d",

            "Alright man hang in there. I might know how you can get out of there and this situation. First find a tiny piece of string, it can be anything even a hair tie. Take that string and find a pair of scissors. Check any drawers but make sure to open them quietly. Having a towel on hand or clothes would be good to cover it and maybe dampen any creaks or squeaking noises. Now once you find any, find a long object such as a pencil or pen. If you can't find that, you'll have to go on without it.\nLeave the drawer shut afterwards. This is important and must be followed. \nGo to the window, there should be some rubber seal around the outer area. Find the begining of that seal. You need to get the pen you found earlier and place it at the begining of that and push it upwards to unseat it. Once it's up in the air run the pen along about 4 inches as you'll need about 4 inches of it. Take the scissors or sharp object you found and cut it off. Place it back down so it's not noticible and take the four inches of the rubber seal and pocket it.\nNext what you're going to have to do is put the scissors under the door, just the blade part and tie the string/hair tie you found to the scissors. Leave it like that for now. Don't forget to tie a tight knot so it doesn't break loose.\nGo to her dresser (I'm sure she has one) and open one of the drawers. You'll need a pair of socks, and color will do. Place this near the bed. Put he piece of rubber next to them. Don't forget the scissors.\nNext you have to find the darker area of the room. If this is near the opening of the closet, remember it. Remember the area. It'll be important in the future.\nOpen the drawer again and take out a small article of clothing, cotton is best. Underwear or panties work best for this situation.\n\nNow here's where the scissors come into play. Begin making scratching noises with them along the door. Trust me, I'm going somewhere with this. If her father is asleep then you'll need to be loud. When he gets up to investigate pull it out as soon as he catches a glimpse of the scissors. He will probably exclaim and rush to locked door.\n\nHere's where timing comes into play. Quickly as he's breaking down the door, put the scissors tied to the string on the door handle. Rush to the bed, \nstrip naked and put the socks in your mouth while shoving the rubber seal into your anus. Violently masturbate into the panties knowing it might be your last and as he breaks down the door scream \"TAKE ME OH SEXY FATHER MAN\" as you nut into the panties and hurl them at his shocked face.\nWith any luck you'll either be able to run past him, or he'll end up killing you.

Funny thing is that my sister walked in the room (looking for something possibly?) and briefly sat on the bed!  He had muscular dystrophy and had a small frame.  She was on her cell phone enthralled in the conversation and she was never very observant.  She then walked out and never even knew he was there.  ",
            "My Asian parents are crazy enough to take out the doorknob if I put one that locked in. One time I replaced my non-locking knob with a locking one, and they broke in through the window and replaced it before I got home. The second time they broke the door frame since they didn\u2019t want to replace another glass panel. The third time they kicked down the door so hard, a desk smashed into my wall mirror and cracked it.\n   \nI\u2019m convinced if I were a girl and locked my door they\u2019d nuke/burn down my room in order to get what was hiding inside (I never really \u201chide\u201d stuff, I just like my privacy).",
            "Yeah I'm not buying it. You didn't really have your story straight in your responses either. ",
            "Why did she text her dad telling him her door is locked and she would open it went she got home? \nAs her dad I would have been super freaking suspicious, wondering how she knew I was trying to get tf in her room ",
            "Wait a minute. So your parents doesn't allow you to have a girlfriend until you move out but you texted them about the situation and asked for help?",
            "OP, you need to step outside your girlfriend's room and start making a shitload of noise rattling the door handle and working up a sweat.  Make sure to wake dad up with the noise.\n\nWhen he comes upstairs upset, tell him that your girlfriend texted you and asked if you could help unlock her door, and that you tried not to wake him when you came in.\n\nSuddenly the door is open and you're now a hero and maybe he'll be grateful enough to let you use his toilet or make love to his daughter.",
            "\"The things I do for love.\" - OP right now",
            "I realize you're not able to escape through the window but, if the bathroom situation becomes urgent, you may have to use the window to relieve yourself. If you need to take a piss, it's not difficult to open the window a bit and whizz out of it onto the roof. If you absolutely have to take a dump, I don't see much choice beyond shitting on their roof. At least it'll get washed off the next time it rains. Does your girlfriend's window face any other houses or public areas where you'd be seen?",

        "selftext": "\nSo this actually happened yesterday. I kept getting this puffy tender spot between my P and B after having sex. I, of course, went down a google rabbit hole. Herpes? A cyst? Hemorrhoid? It wasn\u2019t a pustule or clustered so I was pretty sure it wasn\u2019t any of those things. It would start to shrink a little, then grow after particularly excessive days of intercourse. Just to be safe, I made an appointment with my gyno.  She goes through all the basic questions before starting her poking and prodding. \n\nEventually she stops, looks up at me and asks how often I am having intercourse. She raises her eyebrows when I say at least once a day (hey, we are enjoying the early stages of marriage). Then she asks if we engage in rough sex and again I say yes. Last, she tells me this can happen from engaging in rougher sex with a man who is *eyebrow wag* well endowed. \n\nMy insurance had recently changed and I have been seeing her for a while, but she was now out of network. (They chose not to tell me that over the phone before my appointment, but whatever). I had to pay out of pocket for the exam, and that my friends is how I paid $75 for my lady doctor to tell me that my husband is hung. I already knew that.\n\nTL;DR my husband has a big pee pee and it was inflaming the bottom of my vag bag which made me think I had something wrong down there.\n\nEdit:\nMy husband and I are having so much fun reading through your comments! Some of you are getting more upvotes than my post, and I totally understand why.\nLet me cover some things:\n\n\u2022I know what a perineum is, thanks. Some of you obviously don\u2019t know what a colloquialism is.\n\u2022my husband isn\u2019t intentionally putting me in pain. Would I be taking that schlong daily if I didn\u2019t like it? There\u2019s just some mild side effects from being railed every day. \n\u2022the fuck up is that I paid to be told something I already knew. \n\u2022maybe it is a humblebrag? Sue me. \n\u2022insecure men are coming out in full force today to attack this\u2022a professional would certainly say something like this when you have a longstanding relationship with them. I\u2019ve been seeing her for years\n\u2022again with the colloquialisms. I know that penis, vagina, anus and perineum are the proper words\n\nAlso: please stop asking me to post pics or dimensions. In the words of Kash Doll: \n\u201cAnd I never tell a chick about the pipe I get.\n'Cause if she ever disrespect, I have to fight that bitch.\nYou know that beef stick so bomb.\u201d",

Turns out she had a new boyfriend who was rather well endowed. Anyway, we took her to the OR, put a few stitches in, and the next day I checked up on her and told her to just take things slowly with the new BF.

In all seriousness, if you\u2019re having any kind of GYN problems, my advice is to talk to your gynecologist. I\u2019ve had so many patients who are afraid to tell me what\u2019s really going on, and I try my best to normalize our conversations and make sure they feel comfortable asking questions about sex or birth control etc\u2026 Sex Ed in most countries is pretty lacking, and parents don\u2019t usually do much on that front either, so often your doctor is the best person to go to if you have questions. We can\u2019t answer every question, but I\u2019ve never seen any of us get upset or uncomfortable when someone does ask us about something.",

I retreated to an upstairs bedroom, set myself up, and started pumping. \n\nThe fateful combination of baby-induced sleep deprivation, copious carbs, and wine left me feeling...drowsy. As I sat in the rocking chair waiting for the pump to do it's thing I felt myself nodding off. I figured I would doze for a few minutes while I finished pumping and then return to the (Covid-compliant) family gathering in a timely manner. \n\nNo such luck. I awoke over an hour later, clueless as to the length of my slumber, with nipples the size of wine corks emitting sad puffs of dust with each cycle of the pump. Hours later it still feels as though satan himself tried to suck my soul out through my nipples. \n\nOn the plus side, my otherwise latch-struggling baby has had no problems nursing since my nipples grew 3 sizes today. \n\nTL;DR: fell asleep pumping breastmilk, woke up with giant painful nipples.\n\nETA: If you're breastfeeding or pumping and do decide to imbibe, please be aware that pumping and dumping does not lower the alcohol content in your milk. I pumped and dumped to relieve discomfort, but only time can remove alcohol from your breastmilk. It metabolizes out, and generally takes 2-3 hours per beverage consumed.",

            "You don't need to be worried about your breast milk being contaminated by alcohol. Unless you drink yourself into oblivion the alcohol content in your milk after a few glasses will be that of normal yoghurt. I.e. so little noone even bothers putting it on the label. The only reason not to drink when breastfeeding is you shouldn't be drunk when handling your baby. The whole thing is just a myth/misconception due to drinking while pregnant being super bad and people think its the same for breastfeeding. Really stupid stigma imo that needs to go away. \n\nI did a cursory google of this in english and the amount of moralizing is god damned atrocious and I say this as a man. At least here in Sweden we take a more science based approach, here are our recommendations in English (PDF: https://www.livsmedelsverket.se/globalassets/publikationsdatabas/andra-sprak/rad-om-mat-till-dig-som-ammar/advice-about-food-for-you-who-are-breastfeeding.pdf ) \n\nScroll down to alcohol, almost at the end. The thing to keep in mind is that what passes to milk is a concentration very similar to what you have in your bloodstream, which we measure in BAC and that is percentage of blood that is alcohol. Typically you have 0.04 when you're in a party mood. Somewhere around 0.02 after a glass or two depending on your weight and other factors. That is a miniscule amount and doesn't impact a baby at all in any study. \n\nIn fact due to how prevalent trace amounts of alcohol is in food we know it's harmless due to virtually everyone growing up are exposed to similar trace amounts of it. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5421578/",

        "selftext": "TL;DR at bottom.\n\nI work in a corporate environment in the marketing department. A portion of what I do is handling the corporate website. One of our mid-level professionals (I'll call her Gina) has recently published an excellent research paper that is topical, relevant and insightful. It's a pretty big deal for her professionally, and the company as a whole.\n\nEvery year, we get professional headshots done to feature in corporate documents. It's one guy who does every office, and he's usually pretty good, but with 800 staff and unrealistic deadlines, he'll do colour correction, but no retouching.\n\nSo, Gina's paper is being published, and I'm called on to do all the marketing around it. This includes getting professional hard copies of the document, a social media strategy and some conference speaking work.\n\nThe thing is, Gina's headshot is a little... off.\n\nAs a thumbnail, it's fine, but when it's zoomed in, you can see a definite moustache. Not a little \"maybe she ate a chocolate doughnut for lunch\" mo, but a lip full of whiskers that you'd expect to see on a 90 year old woman who enjoys hitting children with her walking stick.\n\nSo, I can't exactly call up and ask if I should do something about this, as it's not really a conversation I want to have, and I'm also not known as the most tactful person. I'm very familiar with Photoshop, and use it all the time (I've got no Graphic Design qualifications though, so I'm very slow by comparison), so I go about just blending and masking her whiskers a bit. I'm zoomed right in on her mouth to clean up the zone.\n\nI work in an open office, but not many people are in my immediate area. Still, it's not something I want to embarrass her about, so any time someone walks by, I alt-tab to a different screen, or move the pic to a different area.\n\nLo and behold, Gina decides to drop by with her feedback on the printed draft that she's marked up. As she comes by, I hear her footsteps and hit the scroll wheel on the mouse. She comes in and freezes, asks what I'm doing. I say Im just tweaking a picture, and when I look at my own screen, it's zoomed right in on her cleavage.\n\nShe gets louder and asks what the fuck I'm doing fixing her chest area. She then asks if I'm making her breasts bigger, or doing something shady. For some reason, I decide to avoid telling her the truth and just say I'm evening out the skin tone.\n\nShe dumps the hard copy draft and walks away.\n\nAbout an hour later, I get an email from HR saying that I need to stop working on this project, and come in for an interview.  I ask if I can speak privately first, and explain the situation. I still get in a lot of trouble for fixing an image without her consent, and that Gina is more than her appearance, and a suggestion that it's sexist to try and \"make her prettier\". I acknowledge that, but also mention that I tidy up all images that are going to be blown up, men and women alike, but to be honest, I'm just trying to get out of the awkwardness. \n\nWe have the meeting, and I had to explain the whole thing to Gina directly. She is adamant that she doesn't have a moustache (an to be fair, while sitting there, she doesn't. She's sorted that out in the days between the pic and this event). She then goes on to suggest that I altered the pic to add the lip hair as an excuse for staring at her chest (worth noting here, she wasn't dressed provocatively or anything, just normal corporate wear).\n\nI then had to get the photographer to re-send the originals to the HR rep, and they indeed show her lip-bristles.\n\nShe's still livid, and HR suggest that I should jump off this project. \n\nI'm actually a bit concerned as to where this leaves me going forward, as she does have a bit of influence. I told my boss the whole story and he's assured me I'll be fine, in-between being sympathetic, and stifling his laughter at my misfortune.\n\nTL:DR: Tried to edit a moustache out of a female colleague's professional headshot, didn't want to embarrass her by letting other people see, she walks by and I reflexively scroll down to hide the mouth and it looks like I'm zoomed in on her breasts.

In the future, I will partner with my manager or HR when uncomfortable interpersonal matters with my fellow colleagues.\n\nPersonally, I would not do or say anything else directly with your colleague. After a few weeks, schedule a meeting with her and your boss to rain down success and adulation upon her for her work and show her how you're on her side. Ask her for feedback about what you could have done differently/better. She won't mention \"the incident,\" if she's mature enough to afford people a mistake. Also, maybe in a few months invite to coffee to ask about her next project. Slowly slowly rebuild your bridge of trust.",

        "selftext": "TIFU up taking my wedding ring off at the gym.\n\nLongtime lurker, first time poster and I am posting from my phone so please forgive formatting.\n\nI have just recently arrived home following this FU.  I, a very happily married 36M with a small herd of children have been going to the gym in my little town since November 2022. I always go after getting the kids to bed which generally puts me there around 830pm.  \n\nThe gym I go to has two rooms. One has cardio equipment (ellipticals, treadmills, bikes etc) the other room has free weights and various other torture devices.  \n\nMy routine begins the same every time with 9.1-9.5 miles on the bike, which leaves me in a state similar to that of a walrus that has just managed to pull himself onto an iceberg, very wet and breathing heavy. This process takes me  to about 8:55 pm.  I enjoy hitting weights at this time because the gym is often (not always) empty and it leaves me to grunt and groan in peace. Tonight the gym was not empty when I entered the weight room.\n\nNow I mentioned that I have been going to the gym since early November. In that time I have gotten used to the people that do spend time in the gym past 9 and this person was new. Not a big deal, she had brought her own yoga mat (the ones in the gym are blue and red and this one was tyedyeish) and she had her phone set up on a stand, I assumed she was making a video. Both of these observations were made as I walked down to my trusty bench to start my bent over rows.\n\nI grabbed my dumbbells and sat down to continue my ritual and TIFU. I always remove my wedding ring before I lift and tuck it in my right sock for safe keeping. If I try to wear it, it digs into my hand and makes things most unpleasant. So I start grunting out reps with ol\u2019 righty and just nicely switched to lefty when I feel a tap on my shoulder. So I stopped what I was doing and turned to see new girl standing behindish me sporting a menacing glare and wielding her iPhone. I popped out my ear bud and asked what was up. The following conversation is as I remember it.\n\nMe: Hey, what\u2019s up?\n\nNew Girl: You\u2019re disgusting.\n\nMe: Excuse me?\n\nNG: You saw me in here and took off your ring, planning on chatting me up? (This is a little paraphrased, she swore a little too and I wasn\u2019t taking perfect notes)\n\nMe: What?\n\nNG: You\u2019re gross.\n\nMe: Ok.\n\nI proceeded to put my earbuds back in and get to work while she stormed to the other side of the gym and started packing up her stuff. I watched her head for the exit while I was resting between sets. Anyway, I\u2019m rowing away and out of no where I\u2019m blasted with a cascade of liquid which leads me to drop my dumbbell and spin around to see what\u2019s going on.  There\u2019s new girl with her recently emptied pink yeti screaming at me ( I\u2019m assuming for being gross, it was unclear as I had my buds in still.) I remove my ear buds so I can understand her and she storms away. I think the highlight of the exchange is that my gym shirt now smells like vodka. Do most people drink at the gym? Am I doing this wrong?\n\nI\u2019m home, showered and explained why my shirt smells like I\u2019ve had a raging party to my wife. We\u2019ve both had a good laugh. If I see new girls video on social media I\u2019ll be sure to share it here. I don\u2019t know who she was but it\u2019s a pretty small town so it might pop up. Cheers.\n\nTL;DR I took off my wedding ring at the gym causing a lady I\u2019ve never met before to go bananas.\n\nEDIT: Well this got a lot of attention!  So I had emailed the gym owner last night at the request of my wife. (She feels the same as many of you that this lady could be dangerous to others).  He has already emailed back. Apparently new girl received a ban early 2022 for aggressive behaviour with another gym patron. Owner is going to call me later today for some follow up. \n\nI will definitely look into the silicone rings, thanks everybody!\n\nEDIT: Final Update. I had initially planned on responding to a bunch of the comments but there are just so many\u2026\n\nAnyway, new girls previous aggression was verbal. The gym owner has deactivated her key fob and placed her on perma ban. He has also called a few of the smaller gyms in the area to give them a heads up (super cool dude).\n\nThanks everybody for the thoughts and advice. I know I\u2019ve let a bunch of you down by not pressing charges etc. But I also know I have made many of you proud by completing my cardio after lifting tonight. Before I left for the gym tonight my wife recommended a rain coat for protection (she\u2019s the best).\n\nThat\u2019s all for now unless the video surfaces.  Cheers.",

I set an alarm for 10am, woke up around 10:30, took my Vyvanse, laid down for a little bit, and somehow fell back to sleep. \n\n\nAt about 11:30-12 I wake back up, still groggy. It takes my Vyvanse about 2 hours to fully kick in, so I\u2019m still a little out of it. This is where I fucked up.\n\n\nI\u2019m so used to waking up and just BEING up that I started my morning routine over again on autopilot. I strolled over the coffee machine, started to make some, and took my dose of Vyvanse. I realized about 10 seconds after I\u2019d taken it that I had already taken it. \n\n\nHere\u2019s the thing, I can\u2019t throw up. I\u2019ve thrown up twice in my entire life. So that wasn\u2019t an option. Cue frantic googling. Pretty much everyone says I\u2019m going to be in for a wild day, and to stay hydrated. I try to look on the bright side\u2014maybe I\u2019ll get a lot of work done today!\u2014but I was foolish. \n\n\nIt\u2019s been 3 hours since my last dose. I\u2019ve peed around twenty times. I can feel my blood. I took one hit from my Juul and transcended time and space. My stomach is furious. I tried to reorganize my room, started to hammer something into the wall, hit my thumb. Cried. Put my clothes in the dryer and then felt like I needed to have them Extra Dry so I ran them again, the lint in there started burning. Cried. All of my whites now smell like Chicago in 1871. \n\n\nMy body is in fight or flight. I\u2019m so anxious. 30 min ago my mom\u2019s best friend texted me \u2018Your parents\u2019 and nothing else. By the time she responded to my \u2018???\u2019 fifteen minutes later with the picture of my mom and dad when they were younger that she meant to attach, I had already accepted that I was an orphan and was halfway through an article re: how to deal with the sudden passing of your parents. My cat came into my bedroom and I got scared. I didn\u2019t like her stance or general demeanor. \n\n\nCurrently, I\u2019m applying for grad school. I don\u2019t know why. I\u2019m not even done with undergrad. But it feels like something I should do right now. \n\n\nAnyway. I\u2019ll be fine.

I appreciate all of the concerns and nice comments lol. I\u2019m doing alright, I\u2019ve had a lot of water and feel 75% normal. Still wide awake, obviously. Hopefully this inspired a few people to use those pill organizers. I just ordered one. Also, I did not finish applying to grad school. I made the amazing decision to take out loans for undergrad in NYC and if I get into any more debt I\u2019ll never be able to afford groceries.\n\nEDIT 2: Again, yes, I did get a pill organizer.

I take 30mg IR adderall twice a day for mine, although I tried Vyvanse for a little while before deciding it didn\u2019t manage my symptoms well enough.\n\n1.\tSkip the coffee when you\u2019re taking your ADHD meds. Caffeine and amphetamines (Vyvanse = lisdexamfetamine) potentiate each other, so the coffee will actually make your heart, cardiovascular system, kidneys, etc. work harder than they need to. Also, idk about you, but caffeine makes my symptoms worse. Seriously, take a month off caffeine while still taking your meds and you won\u2019t miss it once you kick the physical addiction.\n2.\tNicotine is also a stimulant, and like caffeine, nicotine and amphetamines will potentiate each other. I get that you were trying to chill out from the over-stimulations of a double dose of Vyvanse, but stimulants are the worst thing to do when your central nervous system is already overstimulated.\n3.\tIf you\u2019re worried about accidentally taking too much medication in the future, you can ask your doctor for some emergency Xanax or propranolol in case you mess up again. I can\u2019t imagine a doctor saying \u201cno\u201d to giving you two 2mg Xanax a year or whatever for emergencies.

            "Interesting. When i accidentally took double dose of my ADHD meds (54mg metylphenidate aka 108mg) i would not have noticed anything without checking my pill dispenser. Its only way i can be certain if i have taken my meds, and on that occasion i had held it wrong way around when i first took the meds, so i took monday's meds when i was supposed to take sunday's. Something felt bit weird so after some time i checked if i had taken meds, and noticed i had not even though i clearly remembered taking them. So i took sunday's dose. At some point i noticed next day's dose was missing and realized what happened. Also explained why pill dispenser had felt little weird earlier.\n\nAt no point in the day i felt tired, and in fact i felt slightly more calm than usual. I also had some other meds which i took double dose of, i don't remember what i had at the time, but  maybe some of those helped balance each other out. I don't remember when i was first prescribed (small) dose of beta blockers (because ADHD meds increase my heart rate), but those certainly would have balanced heart rate a little.\n\nEDIT: i also had something for anxiety i think, so i guess i took double dose of those as well. \n\nLesson learned: always make sure you have taken ADHD meds before you take ADHD meds to make sure you don't take ADHD meds twice by accident.",

I asked my friend if he had any meds, and he said he had some Tylenol. Handed me 4 and I popped them in my mouth. Turns out they were not Tylenol, they were Adderal. I felt like i could feel my blood passing through my body. Zoning out found a new definition, and the gum in my mouth had no chance of survival due to my intense mastication.\n\nCouple hours later and I'm home lying in bed, staring at he ceiling. Can't sleep. Figure maybe I should should try to rub one out, but that is now impossible. For those who don't know, (I didn't then being my first time) Adderal induces pretty impressive shrinkage. Like so small, I couldn't remember ever having a pecker so tiny. I'm now freaking out. Thinking I now have a micro penis, and I'll be alone for ever. Which lead my to my next adventure. Pimping out my MySpace to compensate for my now microscopic tool. Yes, that was my genius idea. I'm not talking new header and profile pic, I ended deep diving into the coding of MySpace (I know nothing about coding) I learned how to have a transitional background, interactive widgets, games, videos, you name it, my Myspace was now the most dope page in the school.\n\nFeeling accomplished I went and laid back in bed at 4am. Staring at the ceiling, I now have an anxiety attack. People are going to think I'm trying too hard on my MySpace. I need to go delete all of that. I need to be simple and aloof.\n\nSo I deleted it. Got back in bed and chewed on my lip until I fell asleep 6 hours later. Fuck adderal.",

            "This is an old story. It happened while I was in high school, and I'll tell it as best as I can remember.\n\nI used to take 70mg of Vyvanse back in highschool. Like you, I had a morning routine and would mostly operate on autopilot in the morning. I took 150mg by accident one morning. My mom would leave the pill on the table next to my breakfast. This was a daily thing. I would take the medication then I'd wait for the bus to go to school. That day my mom was out of town, and my dad had to make breakfast and get us ready for school. I went through my routine, and while I was outside waiting for the bus, I started doubting if I took it. I rarely remembered anything that happened in the mornings, and it seemed like a normal thing to assume that dad would forget to put the pill on the table; after all, it wasn't something he was used to doing. Anyway, I used my keys to open the door and headed straight to the pantry to get a pill. I didn't even bother asking dad if he had given me the Vyvanse that morning. He was upstairs, so he didn't hear me walk in. I take a pill and go back to waiting for the bus. \n\nEverything seemed normal that morning. I fell asleep on the bus like I would every day. I walked to class feeling completely fine. I walk into the classroom, take a seat, and that is when it starts. Suddenly, everything started moving slowly. I could feel my heart pumping. I could hear the blood flow through my veins. I start panicking, looking for reasons to explain how I felt. It only took me a few moments to realize what I had done\u2014140 mg holy-shit. I had never taken this much. I was in for a very unpleasant day, and the was nothing I could do to get out of it. I was completely out of it most of the day. I tended to be a pretty quiet teenager, but this took it to another level. I avoided any social interactions, and I'm pretty sure I didn't say a single word the whole time I was at school. Classes were horrible. Focusing on anything important was an impossible task. The sensation running through my body were enough to drive me crazy. I wanted to stand up, run around, scream at the top of my lungs. The frustration of having to sit in class and pretend I was fine had me begging for the day to end. I completely lost the notion of time. I just went through the motions and begged for the day to be over. \n\nIn the end, nothing happened. Sure, it was one of the most unpleasant days of my school life, mired with a day-long anxiety attack, but it wasn't so bad. When you get distracted while on Vyvanse, time seems to flow extremely fast. You lose complete notion of it; before you know it, you are out of time, and the day is over. \n\nWhen I got home, I just went into my room, closed the door, and stared at the ceiling for hours. I was in no mood to talk to my siblings or do anything. Later that afternoon, dad got home from work and went into my room to see how my day had gone. He quickly guessed something was wrong. I told him about my day, and he just started laughing. I didn't find it funny, but he certainly did. He turned around to leave guessing that I didn't want company, called me an idiot, reprimanded me for thinking that he would forget about the meds, and told me to sleep more if I wanted to avoid this happening ever again.\n\n2/10 wouldn't recommend\u2014worst high of my life.\n\nTL;DR: Dad is a good parent, and I'm just an idiot."

Let me spin you a tale...a tale of Shit River.\n\n4:30 pm\n\nOur initial impressions of the house were terrific! Our illustrious host, Paul, left a bottle of red for us on the table along with some chocolates and popcorn. Paul was friendly! Check-in was quick and easy so our party settled in. Everything was looking great!\n\n6:00 pm\n\nWe return from purchasing perishables for the weekend. We fill the fridge as we prepare for a relaxing and restorative vacation. We had all traveled far and been looking forward to this rare reunion! A few days on the beach does wonderful things for the soul, but little did we know how our souls would be blackened forevermore.\n\n8:15 pm\n\nAfter a round or five of drinks, we noticed that several members of the party had disappeared and were nowhere to be found. We discovered them, ominous plunger in hand, staring terrified at a slowly rising toilet (one of two in the house). Plunging half successfully, we messaged Paul and let him know the situation. Only one working toilet isn\u2019t ideal for a group of 8 twenty-somethings drunk on beer and full of tacos, but we\u2019d make it work!\n\n8:38 pm\n\nThe remaining toilet won\u2019t flush. The party grows worried. Paul assures us that he will call a plumber.\n\n9:00 pm\n\nPaul has no luck with his usual plumber; they won\u2019t be able to fix the toilets until the next morning. A five second Google search reveals there are twelve (12!) emergency, 24 hour plumbers in Virginia Beach, but Paul did not want to call them. After \u201cinforming\u201d Our Dear Friend Paul of our displeasure, he put his nose to the grindstone and made a few calls. A plumber was found! Magic!\n\n9:30 pm\n\nRaw sewage floods the shower and both toilets. Kitchen sink makes a strange noise when turned on. The House likely possessed. Drinks have been drunk like it\u2019s the end of prohibition and we cannot drive or Uber to safety. After all, where would we go? We pray to whatever Eldritch creature haunts our plumbing to spare us.\n\n10:01 pm\n\nThe stench. Dear god. The STENCH.\n\n11:20 pm\n\nEmergency plumber arrives with Paul and Paul\u2019s Friend in tow. One of them goes to the roof. One of them pounds a Pabst Blue Ribbon. Advance guard sobered up and makes an emergency run to a public bathroom. We split the party.\n\n12:20 am\n\nPlumber ventures inside the splash zone to duct tape garbage bags around the toilets to seal them in preparation for \u201cThe Final Blasting.\u201d Paul\u2019s Friend fails to discover how to \u201cswitch off his nose\u201d and taps out (\u201cI\u2019m out man, I\u2019m out.\u201d). It\u2019s been hours since most of us have relieved ourselves. The backyard beckons us with its soothing siren call, but we resist. *For now.*\n\n12:22 am\n\nPaul assures us the problem will soon be fixed and to keep partying. Classic Paul! We oblige, blithely unaware of the horror shit show still awaiting us.\n\n12:24 am\n\nTHE FINAL BLASTING. The Stench. The Horror. The Splatter. We all take 2d6 damage.\n\n1:00 am\n\nPaul & Co. tell us the bathrooms are fixed but not to flush toilet paper. He requests we instead put used toilet paper in conveniently provided (bagless) trash cans. We decide to maximize our fun and minimize our bathroom usage. We also decide to leave the next morning.\n\n2:00 am: The Witching Hour\n\nLights flicker ominously. The House isn\u2019t finished with us yet\u2026\n\n4:30 am\n\nPaul offers a full refund (excellent). He later tries to convince us to stay and only refund the first night (not excellent). We ask for a full refund and promise to evacuate in the morning. He offers to let us stay for free for the remainder of our reservation (excellent?) but we decline and agree to leave by noon (clairvoyant).\n\n10:30 am\n\nThe party prepares to leave after a night of sheer terror. We take trash to trash cans, clean the kitchen, and prepare a sacrifice to the Toilet Gods.\n\n11:10 am\n\nWe commence the cleansing ritual in the kitchen. After completion, we agree never to speak of this again. Who would believe our onerous, nay odorous, experience?\n\n11:11 am\n\nTHE GREAT GURGLE. We hear, deep from the bowels of hell, a cursed glugging. Was it the broken spirit of Paul's Friend chugging another PBR? NOPE. The shower had once again started flooding with raw sewage.\n\n11:15 am\n\nWe hasten our efforts to flee. Paul is called. We finish packing all but the final suitcases into our cars.\n\n11:30 am\n\nWe convene to discuss departure. Suddenly, one of our party realizes we\u2019ve been cut off from the last of our supplies by a seeping SHIT RIVER POOLING IN THE HALLWAY. Fearing the end is nigh, a brave hero bounds forth, vaulting across the rising flood waters of the Rubicon. We form a fire line to ferry our belongings and our wounded to safety.\n\n11:32 am\n\nWater oozes up from the baseboards. Satan's Septic Tank thirsts for blood. The lights flicker once more.\n\n11: 35 am\n\nOur Dearest Friend Paul arrives, eloquently prophesying: \u201cThis house is fucked.\u201d Agreeing with Paul's uncanny observation, we flee The House. The smell stayed with us for days but the memories will haunt us forever.\n\nTL;DR I trusted my Airbnb to have functional plumbing but instead it exploded.",

            "Ha! Very good story, allow me to commiserate.\n\nI was in the Marines, attending A-School in Pensacola, FL. It was Thursday, our sacred and unwavering day of cleaning. Around 6pm every Thursday the platoons would gather in the designated parking lot and listen to all the ways we were terrible members of the military unless we cleaned our rooms within an inch of their lives.\n\nOn this particular day I was about to shower after returning from the gym before our field day formation. While I was getting undressed I turned the shower on and immediately heard a *gurgle plop gurgle* from the toilet. I lift the lid, peer into the bowl and notice nothing out of the ordinary. I hop in the shower and hear it a few more times, resigning it to crappy plumbing (what else is new in the world of patriotic service?). I exit the shower and while drying I notice there is no water in the bowl of the toilet. \n\nSo I push the plunger in an attempt to flush some water into it. Big fucking mistake. \n\nIt erupted the most foul smelling, shit speckled piss water you've ever had the displeasure of smelling. All over me. In my eyes, my nose, my mouth. Just an ALS Ice Bucket Challenge of shit water from head to toe. And it wasn't done yet, it continued to slowly gurgle shit water into the floor as I stood in shocked disgust wondering how TF I was gonna clean that up. Needless to say I didn't make it to field day formation on time, which is why I was known as Shit Water for a few months.",
            "Hey there, homeowners insurance agent jumping in here with a few tips. I didn't read the comments so apologies if any of this was already gone over.\n\nIf you're a homeowner, it's important to know what is and what is not covered on your policy. The situation that Paul is dealing with here has a very good chance of not being covered because of the way most homeowners policies are set up. Without getting too technical, most policies don't specifically list what is covered, they list what isn't, and water backup like Paul is dealing with here is almost universally excluded on homeowners policies *unless you have water sewer backup endorsed on your policy*. Check your policy to make sure it is covered now because if you have a night like Paul you make be up to your knees in shit with no help from your insurance company for repairs. Water backup is the most common loss across the country, so no matter where you live, you're at risk for a loss.\n\nAlso, it's a good idea to make sure your insurance company is ok with homesharing before you sign up for it. Your policy carries liability coverage for people injured on your property and most companies are not ok with short term tenants (including airbnb) because more people on your property = more opportunities for injuries.  Along with that, short term tenants tend to treat your home with less regard than you as the homeowner or long term tenants would so the chance of damage to the home itself is higher, which insurance companies don't like.",

One night we get a text along the lines of, guests are having trouble with washing machine--can you run take a look? Sure! Whatever. It's like 9:30p. Get into the basement, two middle aged ladies are standing with the washer door open, gray water pooling on the floor. They are visiting from Canada with four teenage boys for a hockey tournament and they wanted to do laundry before they left. The problem is, the hose that leaves the washer and sits above the PTrap is not letting water run out of the hose, so it's spilling all over the floor. We decide there must be some kind of clog. I notice the water smells a little. One woman is stirring the clothes around in the full-of-water washer, since the water has nowhere to drain out to. Turns out the septic tank was full and the outgoing septic pipe was ABOVE the pipe for the washing machine's outtake. The septic tank contents were running back into the washing machine, filling their nice clean laundry with raw sewage. And she is stirring it with her bare forearm. I scream at this stranger to stop immediately and go wash herself, but when she does, the sink begins to also back up. I find them some rubber kitchen gloves, they gather what they can and head out into the night to try and find a laundry mat. The septic tank dude shows up around midnight and proceeds to pump the contents of the septic tank until 2am. If you don't already know, this is very loud and very smelly.

It never has and so I took them home over summer and they've been sitting in my drawers at home ever since.\n\nAnyway, I'm on intersemester break right now so I (19M) was back home, and poking around in my old stuff found some of them. I decided I'd open the wrapper since I'd never actually used one before or tried putting one on (parents took me out of sex-ed for religious reasons), and I thought it might be good to try one on and try out masturbating with it, so promptly opened the wrapper.\n\nAs I discovered, and the majority of the sexually active population probably know, condoms come kind of lubed already and for whatever reason I took a smell since I could kind of tell it smelt weird.\n\nWhen I did this, I realised that I had not only smelt this scent before, but knew exactly how it tasted. I have memories of chewing on uninflated balloons quite a lot when I was younger (same with rubber bands) and the one memory in particular which became very vivid of was finding a balloon in my parents room and happily chewing on that. Except now I realise it *wasn't* a balloon and was in fact, a used condom. I felt pretty sick then.\n\nI wish I could delete memories and that I'd never remembered/realised this.\n\nTL;DR  got out a condom to try it out, realised I've tasted condoms before.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: A lot of people are asking how my parents use both contraception but also took me out of sex-ed. I have no idea how to label their breed of christian but it's definitely not catholic. I think it's something like evangelical or baptist or nondenominational.\n\nI think the reasons for taking me out of sex ed was to shelter me from learning about sex in a non-religious context, such as not being constantly taught that \"pre-marital sex is sin, homosexual sex is sin, oral sex is sin, masturbating is sin, etc.\" I'm also from New Zealand, not North America as a few have assumed. Here it's taught in year 9 and 10 (ages 13-15) which they decided was too early for me, although they never gave me \"the talk\" either.\n\nThe \"balloon\" was also found under my parents bed, not in a drawer.\n\nThank you for the awards, I wish they could make me forget, at least there is a small positive now from fake internet points.",

My older brother gets there first and he is just dying laughing. My stepdad pops out to see what all the ruckus is about and he loses his shit laughing, too.\n\nThere the kid is, he doesn't seem to have the lung strength to blow it up all round like a balloon but there's a condom in his mouth and bless the kid for trying. Erect, limp. Erect, limp. Over and over as he blows into this thing and then stops for breath.\n\nBut he's not the only one that did weird shit. My oldest brother had no clue what a douche bag was for. You know, those non-disposable rubber ones with the hose on the end that leads out to a plastic wand thing. My mother always kept that hanging in the shower and she catches my older brother sitting in the bathtub playing with this thing and blowing into it. He was older than 8, too. Just naive as fuck.

Perfect.\n\nI apologise to him saying we don't have any black coffee, to which he laughs - not sure why at the time. I hand over this milky mug of coffee to him and his face instantly shifts to the most defeated look ever. The couple seconds of silence were ended with him saying \"Cheers mate\" in a disappointed manner.\n\nThis continued for the rest of the day, every time he asked for a coffee until he eventually went home.

While they were at my house I offered a drink: coffee, tea, water?

Works gonna be a little awkward for a while...\n\nTl/Dr:  female workmate said I looked like I was going to go \"finger a cow\" so as my attempt a a witty response I said \"I'll finger you.\" Now workmates are ripping me a new one by constantly making fingering references\n\nEdit: My first silver and gold!

        "selftext": "I'm on mobile at the moment so I apologize in advance for any formatting issues and all that jizz...I mean jazz. That will be funny, soon. Maybe. \nSo let's begin our story with an obligatory: This actually happened today. Just a few minutes ago. \nMy husband, let's call him \"Steven\"  and I were getting it on like married couples do and all was well. I had a one-way ticket to pound town and it was the ride of my life. We're just about to our destination when Steven takes a detour and stands up. He looks at me and says, \"Come here.\" I know the drill. This is the moment I've been training for. I get on my knees and start doing my thing...or his thing, really. Before I know it, bam. Our destination is right around the corner. Our ride to pound town has just about cum to a close. The big finale.\n\n So Steven looks down at me and gives me the look, lifts my chin up, and I open. Now this is where the FU truly begins. I open up my mouth of course but I also decided in the moment that THIS time, I wasn't just going to close my eyes and stick my tongue out. No. THIS time, I was going to stare deep into this man's eyes sensually as he shoots his load into my mouth. I mean, that's a thing, right? Eye contact to show mutual appreciation for the awesome sex you are finishing? Well the real problem was, I wasn't the only one who decided to switch things up. You see, in the same moment I decided to open my eyes and look into Steven's, he had decided that this time he wouldn't just pop that load into my mouth. He was going to let it explode all over my face.\n\nI'm sure you see what's happening here. Which is good, because now I cant see shit. I couldn't really measure it, but I'm fairly certain that 70% of Steven's load went straight into my eyes. I proceeded to close them as if I could squeeze my way out of this problem. Unfortunately there was no un-squeezing what had already been squeezed into these eyeballs. I hopped in the shower, cleaned up, and rinsed my eyes with water, assuming that would be the solution. My eyes felt like they were on fire at this point. I then turned to actual solution. Contact solution, to be exact. I squirted some in each eye and felt my eyes burning from the inside out. Or so I thought. I looked in the mirror to find that I now look higher than every member of the gang on \"That 70s Show\" put together. For those of you that don't understand the effect of doing the weeds, my eyes are bloodshot. Redder the devil's butthole. I've now used some Clear Eyes in hopes that the burning, redness, and twitching of my eyes will soon dwindle away. I'm truly afraid to go to sleep and wake up blind.\n\n Friends, I just want to say that if you have a Steven in your life, please communicate with him about how and where his loads will be shot. Don't be like me. If you think about being sexy and looking into his eyes while he finishes, I implore you to reconsider. If anyone actually reads this, thank you for being a part of this journey with me. Steven is now sound asleep while I wonder if my eyes will fall out before sunrise.\n\nTL;DR Decided to open my eyes during sexy time trying to be sensual, and got literal eyefuls of cum that have caused immense pain, redness, and twitching. If I go blind tonight, I'll miss you Reddit.\n\nEDIT: \n1) Added paragraphs. My eyes were burning and I've never written a post this long on Reddit using mobile before, so I didn't realize you could still paragraph. Whatever. You get the point. \n\n2) For you sweet souls asking me how I am, I still have eyes! My eyes still hurt but not nearly as much as before. According to some comments, I made a mistake in using contact solution, and in using eye drops. What can I say? I'm good at making problems worse than they need to be.\n\n3) I know not everyone who reads this will believe that it's real and that's okay. I seriously did not expect more than five people to ever even come across this post let alone thousands. Thank you to everyone who has read this regardless of whether you believe it's true or not. I honestly wish it wasn't. I'm glad you took the time to read about my ridiculous mishap anyway. \n\n4) Thank you for every award, every kind comment, and message. I knew Reddit was cool but holy cow you guys are amazing and I'm so thankful! You all made my night. Hope you have amazing days/nights and keep cum out of your eyes for all of eternity!",

I went to a zero carb diet for a while and, I'll admit it kept me from hitting the 300+ zone, but staying above 250 for that amount of time left me a husk of a man. I was tired even though I slept 12 or more hours a day, I stopped playing video games because I simply didn't have the energy or focus to enjoy them, and sex was a chore.\n\nAbout two weeks ago, My GP finally said that she would get me an appointment with an endocrinologist. He diagnosed me as type 1 on the spot, did some blood work to prove it, and called my GP \"An absolutely dangerous idiot for waiting this long.\"\n\nNow? I haven't had a single reading above 200. I'm eating carbs again. I had my first bowl of cereal in five years last night and my meter read 116 at the end of two hours after it.\n\nSo, last night, I felt fantastic. I did my old highschool weight lifting routine, I went for a 20 minute jog, and I had the best sex ever with my wife.\n\nGreat, right?\n\nI wake up this morning and notice something. It hurts to breathe. Every muscle and bone in my body hates me.\n\nLearn from my mistake. Don't over do it just because you feel like Superman. You're very much still human.\n\nWaking up to coffee with cream and my wife making oatmeal made it better. \n\nTL;DR I ran way to hard last night. Body is in so much pain. I couldn't be happier.",

You need to follow instruct...\nDad: test how much insulin my body makes\nDoc: i keep telling you that this can be controlled if you...\nDad: I want the test. This is a family thing that I wasn't aware of\nDoc: (argues)\nDad: (insists)\nDoc (gets huffy, tells him it's his dime but it's a waste of money)\n\nTest results come back\nDoc: so, apparently you are only producing about 15% of the normal level of insulin \nDad: exactly.

            "... 5 years ... ?? Were you on insulin? It\u2019s possible that your pancreas was fighting to keep producing some for those 5 years but most of us with T1 diabetes end up at 500 blood sugar in a week or so without treatment because the pancreases insulin production shuts off pretty quick. \n\nI have... so many thoughts on this and the recommendations for T1 so here\u2019s the best ones.\n\nGet a CGM to monitor you lt blood glucose constantly. Get an insulin pump. IMO the best combo is Tandem pump and Dexcom g6 CGM. This pair talk to each other. The pump will give you insulin or stop your base insulin as needed based on your current levels.\n\nLots of other points but mainly it\u2019s about the amazing tech that can kind of replace your pancreas\u2019 islet cells.\n\nCongratulations on getting that shit somewhat solved!

            "Ha, that reminds me of a really old Bloom County comic of Milo's grandfather saying \"I feel good!\" and doing a dance.  The next frame is him collapsing into a chair saying, \"I feel good; not young, but good!\"",
            "Adult diagnosis of T1D isn\u2019t fun... I biked 25 miles the day I was diagnosed and the docs were surprised I didn\u2019t come in via an ambulance from collapsing.",
            "Oh, yeah, overdoing it hurts so much... but I can see in your last line, you'll be back to it as soon as it doesn't hurt quite so much to move.  Hoo-ah!, neighbor.  Congrats on your correct diagnosis!",
            "You should get tested for covid. Muscle soreness is an early symptom and diabetics are more at risk afaik",
            "I wish I actually felt like superman for once. But I'm glad to know that your TIFU experience wasn't as bad as I thought. A few days later and you won't be as sore, etc.",
            "As a type one diabetic myself, I couldn\u2019t imagine being misdiagnosed as type 2. \n\nIt\u2019s good to see you got the correct diagnosis (even though it\u2019s was after five years).",
            "Super late to the party, but I literally kicked off my year with the same discovery. Glad you got your health back! It's incredible what proper treatment can do for you!"
