            "There has been a quiet revolution in the scientific recognition of the effects of childhood trauma on chronic illness in recent years.  It happened as a result of the Adverse Childhood Experiences study (ACEs) which found that childhood trauma is 1) FAR more common that had been assumed, even in relatively affluent populations, and 2) the higher the trauma \"load\" that someone carries, the greater their risk of everything ranging from (of course) depression/anxiety/substance abuse to (more surprising) chronic illnesses like cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular illness - literally every physical system - and the increase in risk due to trauma is often 200-300%.  These studies have now been replicated all over the world with similar results.\n\nOften, people think their multiple ailments are the result of aging - but in fact they are the result of their unresolved trauma.  Conditions like fibromyalgia, TMJ, neuralgias, lower back pain, headaches/migraines, IBS, joint pain/arthritis, autoimmune conditions are very common manifestations of trauma, whether or not you are consciously thinking about it.\n\n[Here's a Wikipedia link.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_childhood_experiences#Adverse_Childhood_Experiences_Study)",
            "1) We have labels for the issues today. As recent as ten years ago, the general public didn't have the language to talk about several topics.\n\n2) We have laws around such behaviors today. As recent as 30 years ago, is some places, domestic violence was a \"if no one saw it, it didn't happen\" affair.\n\n3) Society has become accepting of such conversations.\n\n4) It tremendously helps traumatized people to be able to talk about abuse trauma in the same way people need to talk about other forms of trauma (eg - car accident, broken leg, work stress, etc.) to help them get over the psychological impact of such events.",
            "Therapy used to be a dirty word. For a very long time, people suffering from mental health issues were put away in institutions (if they were from rich families) or ignored and shunned by society.\n\nIts only within the last half century that mental health started to really be treated as a health issue, and the transition was far from instant.\n\nAs the stigma lessens, the more people are willing and able to admit issues that they would have simply stayed silent about in previous generations.\n\nIts similar to how left-handedness became much more prevalent in the decades after it was destigmatized.",
            "It's always been there. Why do you think some older people don't talk about their childhoods. \n\nWe just know the term for it nowadays. In the future there will be other things which will be seen as something that's common for the time, but was never known about in the past. But it exists.",
            "I've not really found that? Theres alot of not great parents out there and you hear more about nowadays because with the Internet we have the voice and platform to share our experience.\n\nThis question is like when people thought murders spiked with the advent of the TV and Internet, ignorance is bliss.",

Then we got ulcers, hypertension, went postal etc. \n\nNow people can say I have bad feelings and only old timers, in general, give them shit.

            "Because we are raised by people.\n\nPeople make mistakes.

You'll either become a fantastic Liar or you become a very docile person who will apologize for everything regardless of fault and be a perfectionist to the point of harming your mental health. Unable to learn from failure and shut down at the Meer thought of being able to do something. Might as well not even try if I'm gonna fail.\n\nPeople are raised by people. And people SUCK.",
            "Shitty parenting used to be \"normal\".  \n\n\nWe now understand the negative effects of it and how much it actually impacts our daily lives and much more light is being shed on it.   \n\n\nIt's probably only going to get worse, its absolutely insane how many parents still defend hitting children as a form of discipline, regardless of how much evidence of its lasting harm.  \n\n\n\"I was beat as a child and i turned out just fine\"   \n.....Yet here you are defending child abuse....You turned out fine alright",
            "Every person from older generations in my family has childhood trauma. Take a child raised in an abusive household with absolutely no other experience of what a parent is, and they will likely not know how to raise a child in a healthy way. Generational trauma is a thing and it creates a cycle that\u2019s extremely hard to break. \n\nI doubt experiencing trauma as a child is any more common now. People are just talking about it more openly than previous generations did. What I personally feel like I\u2019m seeing more of now is people actually wanting to do the hard work necessary to break cycles of neglect that lead to childhood trauma.",
            "It's a mix of people actually recognizing and speaking on it that didn't before eg. because of therapy and social media, and people over-identifying trauma in basic life experiences because the concept is still fuzzy. I think its mostly the former, but I've seen some people slide too far towards the latter on social media.",

            "It's the age of expressing emotions. I think it's a good thing, the first step in acknowledging the mental health issues we are plagued with is knowing they exist. Now it has to be taken carefully because some people will do it purely for attention.",

            "\"These days\" You don't look much into the past do you? A lot of people have messed up childhoods. The only difference is that we're aloud to talk about it now.",
            "Childhood Trauma today used to be called \"Stern upbringing\"\n\nYou'll hear older generations talk proudly of how they got their asses beat. And I don't just mean spanking I mean literally beaten by their parents and they think it helped them.",
            "It's a mixture of some genuine good in allowing therapy to be seen as an acceptable thing, and people with personality disorders using it as an excuse for poor behavior, wether or not they've recieved any trauma at all.",
            "It's complicated. One of the troubling things about mental health in the modern day is that words have lost meaning. As someone with severe PTSD; I literally stopped speaking for a few years after the incident; it annoys me to some extent the way PTSD is thrown around these days.\n\nIt's like using the same word (rape) for cat-calling as being raped in a dark alley. Words matter because they more accurately describe what happened. If you were cat-called, you should probably use the term verbally sexually assaulted or something like that.\n\nA lot of shitty things probably happened in many people's childhoods that are problematic. It is great to use therapy to work through those things. I've gone through a lot of my own, so I know it's value.  People back in the day just took it and moved on. Maybe you were spanked and just dealt with it. Maybe your coping mechanism later in life was to hit other people. Things were more tolerated. Many coping mechanisms are illegal today. \n\nTrauma is very real. My PTSD therapist spent a lot of time on indigenous reservations in Canada. She worked with the schools, because when you are really in a trauma state, your brain physically doesn't operate properly. These kids were not stupid, they needed their trauma resolved. No amount of education can help if nothing can go in. \n\nI guess I'll say it's two main points in the modern day.\n\n1. We know more about the mental illness of trauma and this is a very good thing as mental illness is very serious\n2. Using the same word can sometimes minimize the situation of those who have the more traditional serious mental illness",
            "I don\u2019t. I had a mint childhood. Parents were sweet, used modern parenting techniques, we had enough money. I had lots of pets and my brother and I got on fine. Only one grandparent died when I was young and he was old and sick.\n\nI didn\u2019t get any real trauma until I was in my 30s. I have a pretty good life and I\u2019m happy.\n\nTo your question though, it\u2019s the same reason that there are suddenly lots of LBGTQ+ people - we\u2019re allowed to talk about it now.",
            "I'm of an older generation. Much older than \"PTSD\" being a diagnostic term.\n\nI can assure you with no doubt that childhood trauma is not a new phenomenon, but psychological and psychiatric recognition of it, together with standard diagnostic criteria, definitely is.",
            "we always had it, we just were more ignorant about it. traumatized children just went on to become traumatizing parents and the cycle continued. if anything, the current ability to identify and prevent or correct childhood trauma may eventually lead to it becoming truly as rare it it seemed to be previously.",
            "IMHO, for same reason PTSD and TBI are now talked about in veteran circles\u2026 we know a LOT more about it NOW than we used to in days gone by",
            "My father described himself being beaten by his grandfather, because his cousin would wake him(gramps) up and say my father did it.  My father's in his 60s now. Tell me that's some \"these days\" shit.  It's always been around.  It's just now acceptable to discuss things and try to heal yourself rather than ignore your problems and unintentionally cause more problems to the younger generations.",
            "Society is becoming more \"liberal\" about sharing feelings and emotions.\n\nI personally think it's a great thing, but it's been a gradual process for generations.  The internet is just speeding things along now.\n\nMy Dad actually had some great insight, he said he remembers all the WWII vets coming home and none of them wanted to talk about what happened overseas.  They drank all the time, shoved all their problems aside because things couldn't possibly be as bad as \"during the war\".\n\nAnd since it was an entire generation that felt that way, they allowed each other to raise their kids however they wanted, without the community stepping in to stop abusive situations.  My Dad says about his Uncle who used to beat my Dad's cousin senseless, \" What was anybody going to say?  He survived the Battle of the Bulge\".\n\nSo following a war-torn generation, you have an abused generation, raised with violence and a fierce obedience to order.  Follow the pushback of the 60s.  Now the 60s generation are the old folks, and they've become super-conservative even though in their day, they were burning bras, having huge student protests, and instigating civil unrest that would eventually create the Civil Rights Act.\n\nHistory does have a trend, for sure.",
            "Consider something like death and loss of a loved one.\n\nWhen I was 9 my older sister was murdered.  I saw it happen, as did my older brother.\n\nThis was 1972 - 50 years ago, so as you imagine the idea of talking about it to someone just didn't happen.  My parents didn't even talk about it openly but it disrupted our family.  I grew up haunted - literally - by the experience for the fear, anger, anxiety and guilt - yes guilt, I felt because the sister I loved so much was gone and I was still alive.  For years after I was afraid to even enter what was her bedroom, even though her things had long been taken away.  It wasn't until I was out and on my own decades later that I sought help - even then I didn't dare tell my parents because you just didn't do that stuff.\n\nSome five years of counseling/therapy and medication to deal with depression.  The results were/are not perfect, but a lot of what I was experiencing (reckless behavior, thoughts of suicide, alcohol abuse, etc.) finally had a face and a name, something I could deal with and a means to make changes.\n\nI'm still, at times, haunted by that terrible memory, but it's not nearly the immobilizing nightmare it was when I was a kid and young adult.",
            "The same way how testing for COVID in the early days meant the confirmed amount of cases would increase. Nowadays we just are more aware of these traumas and actually acknowledge them instead of just leaving them unseen.",
            "Because the definition of trauma has become more broad over the recent years and so it's easier to define more childhood experiences as traumatic. Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of cases of legitimate childhood trauma and many people need help to deal with these things; but I also believe that there are those who could easily stretch an experience to be defined as traumatic and nobody can say shit because it would come off as insensitive. The problem is discerning actual trauma from \"not quite trauma\" and being right about it. It seems like an impossible thing to do IMO because you can never walk in another person's shoes. Also defining an experience as traumatic might give a person a reason as to why they feel the way they do. IMO feeling shitty is a complex thing and it's hard to pinpoint it to one specific thing. But as humans it gives us a small sense of security to think we know the cause of what is hurting us.",
            "It's because now with the insurgence of the internet we are able to connect with people all over the world, it also provides anonymity to be able to safely share stuff to people who resonate with it.",
            "There's less stigma regarding mental health so you hear today what people were afraid to say before.",
            "Did something traumatic happen when you were a kid? No? That's far more strange than not having it, tbh.",

            "Have you considered it could be confirmation bias? Meaning you're paying attention to people having mental issues, which are often rooted in the early years but become a burden at the start of adult age. Obviously this doesn't go for *all* mental problems",
            "We were raised by Boomers, \"the Me Generation,\" who had the emotional capacity of a cucumber. You know, the \"sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me\" generation, who would say aphorisms like that about our pains and then spend hours talking about how some random word someone said to them at the grocer was just so wrong and evil and how hurt they were by it. \n\nOur fathers delt with issues by drinking or going out for a pack of cigs. Our mothers either pretended nothing was wrong or spent their time in the wine cooler. \n\nGrowing up we were then also told by teachers and priests that mental health was all quackery, that ADHD meds were just pharma companies trying to make new addicts (something tobacco companies apparently weren't doing to them). Their narcissism prevented them from acknowledging that someone with a master's degree and psychotherapy license could maybe know about mental health than them and their folk heuristics. \n\nPhilosophically, many of our parents resonated with the cultural paradigms of their time. The Modernist agent and meritocracy meant anything that happened to someone was their doing, good or bad. Mixed with Cartesian dualism, this meant they basically didn't even think the brain was anything. They might believe that the mind existed (or the soul, which they likely assumed was the same thing) but the brain with it's chemical processes was just \"reductionist\" to them. So they denounced the ideas of psychology, mental health, developmental neurology, and so forth. \n\nAnd it fucked their children up. And we're still trying to heal from it all.",

            "Because in reality, they do. Mental health was such a touchy subject not even 10-15 years ago and many parents are finally realizing that the things that you say to your children and the actions you take will have lasting effects, some good and some bad but in this case, bad. \n\nChildhood trauma didn\u2019t just pop up at a random point, we have finally been able to recognize that our parents were not perfect and son some cases, should not have been parents at all. \n\nHope this helps",

And it will always be there. \n\nI heard a line once that stuck with me \u201call I can hope to do is to fuck my children up in a different way than my parents did me\u201d. Humans are flawed and children are very perceptive. Everything has an effect on them. It\u2019s not always strictly parents but environmental factors and everything else. I would argue just logically it makes sense for way more people to have experienced something traumatic in their childhood than to go through your entire developmental stages with nothing that fucks with your head. Not saying it doesn\u2019t happen but I wouldn\u2019t expect it to be and overwhelming majority.",
            "It\u2019s not that anything increased, it\u2019s that people are more informed about the topic, get therapy sooner (if not at all), are generally more mindful due to information being more accessible and less expensive. Like back in the day if I wanted to read about mental health I would have to go to the library and be hit from all directions with academic (aka unnecessarily exclusionary language). Now I can go on tiktok and hear a professor of psychiatry describe conditions that I might recognize myself in, and I\u2019d start from there. Not to mention what an absurd impact just google had in this sense. I mean yeah, self-diagnosis is not the end point, but it might be a first step toward an actual, professional diagnosis by someone who\u2019s actually competent. Not to mention the wealth of free academic papers you\u2019ll find instead of them being available only to certain circles. \n\nAlso, survivors have now a voice we didn\u2019t have before. Who would listen to us before we had the possibility to have platforms? Literally nobody, very often not even our family and friends would listen and take us seriously, and this is very relevant in the case of sexual trauma. The internet can be the bane of humanity sometimes, but I think the innate ability to connect with a community you might feel isolated from is a massive win for anyone who\u2019s disenfranchised and alienated in our trauma. The normalization of talking about it is only giving you the impression there are more traumatized people. But truth is, nearly everyone has had childhood trauma, and the earlier you were born the more likely it is that you were traumatized in some way as a kid. And it\u2019s coming out now because we were even minimizing our trauma, thinking \u201cit happens to everybody\u201d and \u201cthis is normal\u201d or \u201cit wasn\u2019t so tragic\u201d. \n\nLuckily, even in this sense more awareness = less mistakes made by parents, teachers, other adults in general. Although of course, it\u2019s still a massive issue that kids now will have to deal with later.",
            "because a lot of people do have childhood trauma lmao",
            "Older generations couldn't even talk about trauma. Trauma was always there, anxiety was always there, we just had different ways of talking about it (i.e people with 'frayed nerves, people with the shakes, etc. All sorts of medical issues couldn't be addressed in the past solely because of social attitudes around them. Hell, think about even how older women don't talk about things like miscarriage, periods, etc vs. women my age being completely open about that shit because it's a medical necessity to start conversations about it.\n\nOn top of that trauma heavily informed things in the past such as significantly pushing victims to things like alcoholism, such as people who saw war becoming horrendous drunks and such like that - the language for openly talking about trauma was very limited, and social or gender norms also shames acknowledging that sort of stuff.\n\nIt was the advent of things like psychoanalytics / therapy that actually addressed how negative life experiences can play critical and formative roles in developing 'trauma,' a response to anxieties, abuse, fears etc based on past experience.\n\nIt's not that there is more or less childhood trauma today, it's just that concepts of what is and isn't trauma have kind of been centralized into a descriptive way of explaining what those feelings are, and there is also now a whole medical and scientific community around identifying and medicating it, and pursuing health outcomes based on it which fundamentally just did not exist (or exist at scale) even 100 or 50 yrs ago.\n\nAnd I mean, older people around you *do* have trauma. You probably have adults in your life approaching their 60s who get unreasonably upset at even the smallest shit and it's probably because their whole bodies anger-response is short fused because of a lifetime of issues never addressed, not because there are reasons to be legitimately upset at something.\n\nHeck, if you grew up in a household with very angry people, you yourself probably grew up with a sense of learning how to mediate/control settings and conversations around trying to mediate and prevent people around you from getting mad - you can't even be yourself around those people because most of your effort goes into leading conversations around their mood and keeping it calm (i.e think about anxiety you feel about family shit around the holidays, is it because your father kicks up shit over the dumbest things and do you try to do what you can to avoid those things happening?)",

Without the larger communication to the outside world that we have now meant that the local gossip train ran harder than ever. My mother was a vile woman who abused me and my sister horribly and even hid it from my father in very clever ways. The abuse happened very regularly while she gave off the appearance to the other families on our street that she was June Cleaver or some other perfect TV show housewife from the 60's. Talking bad about your own family was extremely frowned upon on any level. \n\nTrauma from abuse as well as trauma from any other source did not just mystically start happening the past few decades. We are more aware of it now due to the internet.

            "It's true that people are more aware of it these days: they have the language to discuss it and they feel permitted to do so, socially. At the same time, early trauma is extremely trendy at the moment. It's a powerful narrative that can be applied to explain almost any present unhappiness. I suspect it's emotionally appealing because it provides a clear, simple explanation for suffering that typically absolves the sufferer of all responsibility by framing them as a victim (not that there is necessarily anything wrong with that!). It's probably also appealing to practitioners because it's so easy to explain the complexity of pain using the concept of trauma, giving the practitioner some sense of efficacy and control in their role.

            "I'm a therapist in the UK. I believe that there's a refusal to accept personal responsibility in our lives. Obviously everything is not entirely your own fault, but almost everything has a degree of personal responsibility. Until we recognise that, we cannot truly address our issues. \n\"But\" you say, \"a child subjected to trauma is not responsible for that\". But how they choose to deal with it in later life and in which way they allow it to affect their ability to live a fulfilling life is to some degree their responsibility.\nIt's a whole embracement of blame culture. \nYears ago when I was a kid, if you had an accident, it was either due to you not listening to your parents/guardians, not taking care, not concentrating or perhaps it was actually just an \"accident\"... something that was purely a result of misfortune. \nThere's a notion that everyone needs therapy. In fact, most people really just need someone they can trust to talk to. In many ways that's what therapy is. Externalising the problem, getting it in proportion (when too much is jumbled up in our head, it's very easy to get an unrealistic idea of how important certain matters truly are.\nWithout a doubt, our dependence on digital and social media have contributed to a break down in the kind of relationships that formerly played this role in our lives. \nPerhaps it's merely progress and how things are fated to fall. Perhaps we will realise our error and set aside the devices that are specifically designed to maintain our attention, generating obstacles to the very things that truly matter in our lives. Only when it's too late do we realize that human connection that we once had and played such a vital role in the pursuit of happiness.\nPut down the box that fritters away your time and distances you from the human connection. There's still a world outside worth experiencing and people who do want to know you and you do still matter. \nOnce you have established a healthy mind, thought processes and human interactions, any traumas from the past that need resolving will be evident and can be addressed.\nThere's definitely a good deal of suggestion too. We have a tendency to look back and examine situations in the light of today's values. Remember that the past was a different time and our experiences may not be what we remember them to be.",

Our skills matrix has about 60 things on it, some easier than others, some more well known in the industry than others, and some more important to the business than others. Nobody in the team is the exact same at everything, therefore each individual will have a different \"worth\" to the business. Your pay is what you and the business negotiate and agree. I might be happier at one level of pay, but someone else at another level of pay. \n\n\n2. You also need to consider the overall benefits to a person. That's Pay, Car allowances, expenses policy, but also how close to home, working conditions, flexibility from your boss. Think [Maslow's hierarchy of needs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs). So my overall needs may be met by a package with a lower pay than you, but that I'm happy with. Yours may include a higher pay and less of other things. Discussing just the pay may make me look worse off which could be embarrassing, but overall I'm actually doing alright and I wouldn't want to get into discussing everything\n\n\n3. In my old job I know I got paid less than many people, either as a direct comparison or ratio of their skill & pay to mine. I couldn't get a pay rise and so my only option would be to change jobs. I didn't want to take that risk and so didn't. I wouldn't want to be constantly reminded of my lower pay. Note that the experience I got there helped me to get a better paid job later so swings & roundabouts\n\n\n4. I know I get paid more than people who have been my friends for 15+ years and work in different careers. I have no interest in actually discussing my pay with them. As long as we're all happy why does it matter. Some people see pay as the only indication of how successful you are, I see it as how happy you are doing what you do.",

Now I'm older I realise this was just an attempt to prevent sharing of information. I now see it the other way, if you are getting paid less then someone else doing the same job then you have information and a stronger position to negotiate from in your next pay review...\n\n...and if they won't pay you what you're worth then find another job that will.",

Before they settle you in one place, it was common for the bank to send the HS graduates to a variety of departments, have them work the low end jobs and get reports back from their temporary managers.\n\nSo, I am sent to the basement of the bank, where paper forms are collected and processed for destruction. This was 1980, mind you. In the break room we had a Chinese woman, an immigrant. She would sit alone with a cup of hot water, even though coffee and tea were free and readily available. Some other women thought that was strange, so confronted her about it. The Chinese woman patiently explained that in China it was customary to drink hot water, just to warm you up. Well, it was July, but the AC was on, so maybe that made sense, to her.\n\nBut those other women? As soon as the Chinese woman left they started laughing and making fun of her accent. \"I... drink... hot water!\" Ha ha ha. Yes, very rude. And no, they were not white women exercising that privilege that white people didn't know we had at the time, that allowed us to trample on everyone with no repercussions what so ever. \n\nBut I digress. The point is, it could simply be customary. In Germany I would ask for water and the waiter would ask me \"Gas or no gas?\" And I'm like, what? I found out that the Germans and a lot of other Europeans like to drink carbonated water, with no sugar or syrup like you put into a soda pop.\n\nSo get her that cup of hot water and simply ask her about it. Differences in culture are nothing to be afraid of, especially when it comes to something so simple as water.",

            "Assuming infinitely strong, perfectly rigid etc. it would support its own weight in compression, and not fall.\n\nHowever I'm pretty sure a ring like that wouldn't be stable so you'd need something constantly correcting its position to stop it from drifting and crashing into the Earth.",
            "An object inside a hollow sphere experiences no net gravity. The pull in each direction is the same as the proximity to one edge is balanced by more mass being on the other side. A rigid ring around a planet would be this, but a 2d slice. Any perturbation to the bridge would cause it to drift up or down. You need to constantly adjust the position to correct this, or it will eventually collide with the surface.\n\nIf you scale up your model from a bridge around a planet to a ring around a star, you have Larry Niven's [Ringworld](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringworld). His world had this same issue, and wrote a sequel to fix it when fans pointed it out.",
            "The immediate foil is the tidal force due to the moon, this would immediately cause it to move from its stable position and result in one side experiencing a greater acceleration due to gravity than the other (towards the earth). For a perfect system it is in an unstable equilibrium, so any deviation would result in collapse. I.e. no.",
            "[removed]",
            "You would also somehow need to control the weather and have perfectly calm weather at all times. Because with no supports, over time, even the wind would be a problem. Moreover, you would also need to make sure that there is an even load on all of the surface of this bridge, otherwise it would also crash into the Earth",
            "If you put magnets all along the underneath of it and magnets on the earth which could be causing it to spin and you could control the spin by changing the angle of the magnets you could create a cool spinning thing",
            "Quite a few problems need solving first:\n\n1. There is no known material strong enough to build this from, Earth\u2019s tidal forces would destroy it as soon as you removed all the supports.\n\n2. Earth isn\u2019t a sphere, and less so about the shape but the gravitational pull is different depending on the differing levels of mass under the Earth\u2019s surface. This gravitational pull is also changing constantly due to the core being liquid, so you can\u2019t design a simple bridge to fix this.\n\n3. Removing the supports without that process affecting the bridge. You\u2019d need to time it perfectly across all parts of the world.\n\nI\u2019d say as a theoretical problem, if you had a perfect sphere with uniform density and a bridge with unbreakable/malleable material, then sure, it would work. But it would not work on Earth.",
            "If you take that structure and make it spin, you get an [orbital ring](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_ring): a megaproject which would make space launch far cheaper. Unlike a space elevator, it requires no extraordinary new materials.",
            "I have thought of this before and debated it with my friends. And the conclusion we came to was the following. The ring has a center of gravity and the sphere has a center of gravity. Both centers of gravity is smack dab in the middle of the objects. Gravity acts on the center of gravity and thus if you put the ring around the sphere the centers of gravity of the objects would try to get as close to each other as possible, which means the ring will hover around the sphere. If some guy would push the ring off-center then the two centers of gravity will no longer be aligned and when the guy stops pushing the ring, the two centers of gravity will again try to get as close to each other as possible thus the system is autocorrecting.",
            "There was a vsauce vid on this but to cut to the gist of it , the earth's gravitational field varies from place to place so does the pull of the moon and in result there would be uneven forces acting on the belt causing it to disassemble.",

            "No-depending on the thickness of the earth, the surface gravity differs slightly between locations. Somewhere with higher gravity would pull the ring to the ground, likely destroying it on impact.",
            "If it were perfectly rigid and the Earth were a perfect sphere, then, yes, it would hover without support. It the real world, no material is rigid enough, and the gravity of the Earth is not perfectly symmetric, so it would break and crash.\n\nHowever, if the ring is made to spin fast enough to match orbital speed, you have the basis for an orbital ring. The material doesn't matter in that it's not supporting its own weight, and you only need minimal support to keep it from drifting. At 200 km of altitude for a Low Earth Orbit, it is possible to run tethers to the surface with common mass-produced materials, unlike with a space elevator.",
            "If the bridge itself was rigid and the material was indestructible then yeah it could hover in the air, at times, but it would move around A LOT that includes hitting the surface of the earth, traveling away from its original site. It would be affected by the gravity of the moon, earth's mass and thus gravity not being uniform, wind/weather, etc.",
            "Unless the bridge had a way of actively correcting for gravity fluctuations, I believe it would eventually \"fall\"",
            "I dont think so, even under perfect conditions, let the earth be moving in a particular direction with velocity v the instant b4 the support is removed, the next instant the earth would change its direction slightly but if u consider the bridge, it still would go with velocity v in the initial direction as net force on it due to earth would be zero, so it cant hover around the earth imo, not sure though, feel free to correct me",
            "Depends on where we build the bridge, if we consider the bridge built from east to weast or vv, considering ideal conditions, it would be pretty stable\n whereas if we build the bridge from north to south or vv, it would collapse under its own weight due to gravitational force for sure because the earth is slightly bulged near the equator and gravitational force decreases non linearly from the pole to the equator.\n\nEdit : I read a few other answers which consider external forces like those of other planets and stars, my answer neglects all of that and my system is earth and it's atmosphere only",
            "No, the gravitational pull of the earth isn't consistent.\nId would start to move and crash into the earth. Also the internal forces in the structure would bend/break it.",

This would mean that it wouldn\u2019t have trouble staying in earth\u2019s orbit since there wouldn\u2019t be anything to cause it to fall to the earths surface since gravitation is balanced. The effects on it from other things like the moon and getting hit by debris from space may cause it to drift into the surface of the earth. \n\nIf it drifted enough away from being centered around the earth it would crash into the ground on one side it would then oscillate repeatedly crashing into the earth and destroying everything in it\u2019s path.",
            "This is easily the best question I have seen on here",
            "So what you\u2019re proposing is Halo Forge World?",
            "Nope, wouldn't work. There are numerous factors that would lead to it eventually crashing down on the Earth. Solar winds, random impacts from meteors and cosmic dust, fluctuations in Earths magnetic field, heating and cooling based on surfaces being exposed, then unexposed, to the sun. I can go on. Even satellites need their orbits adjusted periodically to maintain their orbits. Which is refreshing in a way. All of that space junk flying around the Earth won't stay there forever.",
            "If you like it then you shouldn\u2019t put a ring on it.",
            "Air currents are not perfectly even, and the Earth\u2019s density is not uniform.  The ring would quickly drift (instability), and the dynamic instability means the drift itself would make it more unstable, until one edge contacted the ground.  \n\nLikely it would also begin rotating differently from the Earth, leading to a bit of slide also.  Once it dug in, the centtrigufal force would create a wobble, a counterbalance to the Earth\u2019s spin.\n\nAny kind of orbit has what\u2019s called \u201cstationkeeping\u201d.   A ring, a sphere, or even a point mass at certain, interesting orbits \u201cLagrange points\u201d require more stationkeeping effort than a free orbit, because a binary orbit is the same as two rocks tied by a string (gravity is unidirectional) and pulled taut by the spin about the barycenter (orbital motion).",
            "Now, I\u2019m not scientist, but aren\u2019t you essentially proposing something like Saturn\u2019s rings, except more... solid?",
            "It would quickly wobble and crash. Think of it like balancing a pen point down. On paper, the forces balance, but reality isn't that perfect. However! This is similar to an idea called an Orbital Ring. Basically, you have a bunch of satelites in the same orbit around Earth, making a connect-the-dots circuit around the planet. You connect them with pipes and use solar power to push plasma in the direction of the orbit, faster than the orbital velocity. This pushing has the equal-and-opposite reaction of pushing the satelites and piping in the other direction, eventually leaving them stationary relative to the surface. Put several of these rings together and have a computer system manage the velocity of the plasma, and you can place a platform on them. You'd need a few guide wires connected to the surface, and those would be perfect places for transit to the ring - a combination train/elevator taking you to space. You could even have a mass driver sending cargo and passengers into higher orbits for transfer to other parts of the solar system.",

            "No.  This bridge would no doubt have a lot of steel in it's construction. The Earth's magnetic field is not perfectly consistent, so at some point on the bridge, it would be stronger than another point. This would destabilize the bridge and bring it down.",

            "Vsauce\u2019s video \u201cShould You Eat Yourself\u201d answers this question, but a bridge built like this would most likely shatter into a bunch of pieces and fall to earth. If, in the future, we find a truly unbreakable material for this bridge, it will most likely begin spinning around the earth like a hula hoop.",
            "No, even with the assumptions that it's perfectly built and everything, and here's why: gravity from other sources. The sun's gravitational pull on the earth would be different than the sun's gravitational pull on this bridge due to the force of gravity being directly proportional to the mass of either object. Combined with the fact that the earth's orbit is elliptical, meaning that gravity would also be confounded by the inverse indirect proportional relation of distance to the sun (meaning when it gets closer, gravity is stronger), things would not go well.",

            "It is an equilibrium position, but it isn't a stable equilibrium position. If we ignore all of the complicated stuff going on, the surface details of the earth, the variation in gravitational field strength, the rotation of the earth etc and we pretend that there is a stationary sphere the same size as the earth with your bridge around it, it could sit as an unsupported ring. However, just like a pendulum which you can balance upside down (like balancing a pen on your palm), it is not a stable position. There are no net forces on the ring, as the attractive gravitational force is constant at each point (when it is an equal height from the surface). But, when it moves a small distance one side will get closer to the earth and the force of gravity will be larger there (as the attractive force of gravity is stronger with smaller distances). This force will push the ring further out of balance and will cause it to fall.  \n\n\nIf you made this in a perfect computer model you could get it to balance. If added in any tiny detail of reality it would not stay still. It would quickly fall from its starting position.",

Basically an easy way to get above the atmosphere without rockets. \n\nLeft to its own devices it would drift to one side so you have to put thrusters on it for course correction, along with some really strong tethers.\n\nThere is no material that would stay uniform under only its own strength, so one way to cheat is to make its net velocity equal orbital speed. You do this with tubes full of magnetised particles travelling much faster than orbital speed whos force pushes on the rest of the structure which remains stationary.\n\nHeres a nice video with more info on orbital rings: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMbI6sk-62E",
            "You could theoretically make it stable by spinning it up to orbital speed if the circumference was greater than the atmosphere and it would be pretty stable.\n\nTo take the concept a bit further: you could take a steel cable stretching around the earth and have it spinning at double orbital velocity, then encapsulate it in a tube with no velocity and have it magnetically linked to the cable. Then the weight of the tunnel would cancel out the cables extra outward momentum and you would have a ring that seems to magically float above the earth.\n\nAfter that you can attach the ring to the surface of the earth with cables or towers and send power up to spin the cable even faster with electromagnetic motors which will grant the ring to support even more weight allowing you to build on the ring and transport supplies to and from the surface with elevators.\n\nThis allows lots of cool things like launching your spaceships into orbit from the vacuum of space by firing them out of really long maglev tracks saving 90% of your fuel.",
            "Here  is a paragraph  from an article  on how Satellites  stay in orbit  around  earth. \n\n\"In Earth\u2019s case, the gravitational pull is calculated to 9.8 m/s2. However, that is a specific case at the surface of the planet. When calculating objects in orbit about the Earth, the formula v=(GM/R)1/2 applies, where v is velocity of the satellite, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the planet, and R is the distance from the center of the Earth. Relying on this formula, we are able to see that the velocity required for orbit is equal to the square root of the distance from the object to the center of the Earth times the acceleration due to gravity at that distance. So if we wanted to put a satellite in a circular orbit at 500 km above the surface (what scientists would call a Low Earth Orbit LEO), it would need a speed of ((6.67 x 10-11 * 6.0 x 1024)/(6900000))1/2 or 7615.77 m/s. The greater the altitude, the less velocity is needed to maintain the orbit.\"\n\n\nhttps://www.universetoday.com/93077/how-satellites-stay-in-orbit/\nI'm not a scientist  but a science lover  so  take it with a grain of salt.

            "Assuming fully rigid body, constant gravitational pull, and being built high enough initially to clear all surface structures, it will in theory work. It's basically the same way arch bridges supports themselves. When pulled uniformity \"downward\", each elemental sections of the bridge are under compression from it's neighboring elements, resulting in an equal and opposite support force and thus prevent collapsing. However without any additional stabilizing structures, such as cables or pillars, things like wind, tidal force, or minute gravitational fluctuations will cause the system to be out of balance and hit back to earth. Realistically, there's no known material that's rigid enough nor strong enough to achieve this near earth's surface. The only possible way is to build such bridge at or very near orbital height, which allows it to support itself through the balance between gravitational pull and centrifugal force...",

There's no way to make such an arrangement self-stabilizing, where if you pushed it off-center it would tend to re-center itself.  Push the ring off-center, and it tends to move further off-center.\n\nThe second is that at any place in the ring, a cross-section of the bridge would have to support half the bridge's weight.  No material made of atoms is that strong.  Think of piling up, say, sheets of steel to make a tower 5,000 km tall.  The ones at the bottom would be squashed and ooze out as if they were paste.  And we don't have anything readily available that's stronger than anything made out of atoms.\n\nBe cool to see, though, if you could build it.\n\nEdit:  Just occurred to me that one could solve the second problem by spinning the ring / bridge so it was moving at about 10km / second.

            "My parents \"rule\" was that if we were in school they payed for our expenses, except for spending money. If we were working & not in school, we paid for phone, car insurance, gas/personal expenses with the expectation that extra income was going toward paying student loans or saving toward eventually moving out.\n\nAs for the dog in the situation.  \n\n\nHaving a dog is a fairly expensive, time consuming, and long term commitment that shouldn't be taken lightly. Not only will her regular costs increase, but it will also limit potential housing options as she looks toward moving out. If she's really set on keeping the dog, she needs to be paying for its expenses and pet insurance if that's an option or setting aside funds for inevitable future expenses associated with pet ownership. Aside from the costs she needs to consider whether she's willing to schedule her life around a dog. If needs to be walked/taken out to potty multiple times a day, she can't leave it for more than 6 or so hours at a time, no spontaneous overnight trips. I would highly recommend that you refuse to care for the dog (as much as is safe/humane), so that she sees the real impact it will have on her life. She needs to seriously consider whether she's ready for this kind of commitment because it's so much better to rehome the pup now both for her and it before they bond too much.",

            "You've gotten plenty of good advice about the bills, but I think the dog is a separate issue that still needs to be addressed.\n\nA dog is a household decision, and it is not appropriate for one individual in the house to get a dog if everyone else has said they don't want a dog in the house. Further, she is reaching an age where she may soon consider moving out, and between landlords that don't allow pets, landlords that charge insane pet deposits, and roommates that don't want pets, she's potentially eliminating the majority of her future housing options on a decision she didn't think through the consequences of. Realistically she probably needs to return the dog with the understanding that it is something you get when you're at a more mature/stable part of your life, and then help her navigate what that looks like. It it's not a punishment and shouldn't be framed as one, but I think she still has some learning to do.",

You have the right to thrive and they have the responsibility of life, like everyone else.   The fact she got the dog after hearing the household opinions means she needs a wake up call. A big one.  \n\nTurn off her cell and have her get her own account.  It means more when you get the bill in your own name and your service is cut off if you don\u2019t pay.   She also needs her insurance In her own name (I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s car insurance).  Having to pay bills that come to you directly means a lot and is part of the learning process.

I was like...I don't make anything lol.

I think it's more than reasonable for an adult child to pay for their own stuff like a phone and for whatever they cost you extra like adding them to car insurance.

As i got older, my parents had a divorce etc. I payed rent at home from 18 and untill I left home as a 21 year old. My father wanted me to pay rent from the get go (13) but i pulled the law on him stating he was obligated to pay for basic needs as long as I was a kid.

When they start earning i will encourage them to start a savings account. When they turn 18 I'll assist them into investments.

Even if the parents left them money, that money is soon gone because it has no value to them  They did not have to earn it.

The rest of the world will not be so willing to give them an easy way as the parents may have.  And they will not know how to deal with it.  An easy life now could lead to them being homeless on the street once you are gone.  Also, the fact is, it is your house, you pay the bills and your rules should mean something.

            "Personally, I moved into my own place the month I graduated high school at age 18.   I had saved up the money and bought everything I needed to start out on my own during the previous 2 years working after school and on weekends.    I did it all on my own, with  no financial help from my parents (my parents were dirt poor, they had no car, bought a house with no indoor plumbing for quite a while, and raised most of their own food.   they were homesteaders before it became trendy).    Granted, my first place was a 10 year old mobile home on a rented lot, but I bought it and it was mine.   I then started working 2 full time jobs and paying cash for college night classes and in 5 years bought my first apartment building with money I made pumping gas and working in a restaurant kitchen while still supporting myself and going to school part time.\n\n   When I got married later in life, my step children both went to college, mostly using money they had saved although we did take out parent+ loans for both of them.    One lived on campus, the other commuted and worked a full time job as a pharmacy tech nights and weekends.   The one that lived at home while in college we did not ask to pay anything for household expenses during that time, but she bought her own car, clothes, books, and paid her own cell phone bill.    Both of them got their own places as soon as they graduated college, and both had saved for and bought their own first houses within 2 years after that.   With no help from us,\n\n   These are not privileged or exceptional kids.   They come from a middle class home, we are not rich, I work a blue collar job.   The difference between them and most of their friends is that we instilled a strong work ethic in them from a young age, and taught them to save money.   We were there to help if they had a setback or failed, but made it clear they were expected to pay their own way after they were done school and they planned ahead and did.\n\nWant a car as a teen?   Sure; go ahead and buy one.  We helped them get a car loan, which established credit for them, but only after they got steady part time jobs and proved they could make the payments.   Want a $200 pair of sneakers in high school?   Heres $50 towards them, what we budgeted towards school shoes, if you want those more expensive ones you can kick in the difference.   Know what?  although they had the money in the bank, both kids chose to just stick with the cheaper ones.\n\nWant a cell phone?  Sure; Mom put them on her plan, got whatever bottom end phone was included for free, but they had to pay their own share of the bill even as kids.    Want an Iphone?   that you have to pay for when you save up the cash.\n\n   Kids will do what you teach them to do.    If you want them to learn to expect that everything they want will be handed to them, then tell them you dont expect them to pay anything towards those things.    Want them to learn to handle money, budget, and plan for things they want?   Then teach them that is how things are and stick to it.     It's hard when you want to give your kids all the things you never had when you grew up poor, but by making them work and pay for things they want you are teaching them a far more valuable lesson and equipping them with the skills and discipline they will need to be successful later.   they may not appreciate it when it is going on, especially when they have friends that get anything they desire given to them, but they will as adults looking back on it.\n\nedit:   Incidentally, both of those kids just turned 30; both have successful careers and make more money than we do, both have nice homes, excellent credit scores,  and little debt.     I'm proud of them.",

            "I\u2019m 24. My parents are not the most intelligent or financially responsible people. Since I dropped out of high school (around 18 years old) I\u2019ve helped them financially in anyway possible. I worked 60-70 to hours a week in a low pay high production warehouse while both of them were unemployed to just keep money coming in. That was also when we had been evicted from our house and had to live at my grandads place which was an hour and half from where I worked. I was 18 during this moment specifically. During this time I also managed to get my license and finance a loan for a car through a credit union. That was the only vehicle out of me and my parents that we owned. I supported my parents habits the whole time we lived at my grandads, cigarettes, methadone, transportation, whatever else came up. They didn\u2019t find jobs in the 6 months we stayed there. Neither graduated high school nor do they have any skills or trades so they were limited in jobs. We ended up getting kicked out of my granddads after things got pretty crazy and my grandads wife threatened my dad with a knife. So in our situation we moved into this hotel that was in decent enough shape but only had one bed. I slept on the very thin carpeted concrete floor while they got the bed. Atleast that place was closer to my work so that was nice. There\u2019s plenty more that\u2019s happened since then some for the better and some for the worse. But my point is, I\u2019ve never had a parent really keep me stable financially since I was a teenager. So seeing your post makes me realize there\u2019s decent parents who are willing to sacrifice for and or support there children. Just the fact your helping in anyway is awesome, and idk what you will decide to do. But just know that your still doing better than a lot of other parents.",
            "Not a father but when I was 18 I was expected to do one of either thing. \n\n1 - Get a job and contribute to the household. This could be anything you decide from paying for groceries, water + power, a portion of rent (e.g if median rent of your area is 500 per week, she will contribute roughly 25-30% equivalent). You can either put your foot down and make it a \"take it or leave it\" situation or mutually agree on something. Depends on you and your relationship.\n\n2 - Go to school and pay only what I can contribute (could be zero if I wanted). This is so I can focus on school. I would still have a student loan which I would have to pay for in the future. I could work part time but not a requirement.\n\nIf neither of these choices were worthwhile then option 3 is move out.\n\nPersonally, I picked option 1. I personally contributed to groceries and utilities. Having said all this, she is 100% responsible for the dog, please do not fall into a trap of taking care of the dog. As a dog lover myself, I'm sure it will suck to basically reject an animal who is not at fault but you need to be hard on this, otherwise she will expect you to continue to do so because \"you did it before\". Make her take responsibility for her actions.",
            "Not a pro.  Just my opinion.\n\nTell her:  \"If you can afford to support a dog, you can afford to support yourself.  You need to support yourself beginning now\"  Stop paying her bills and don't give her any  money.  Sleeping in your home and eating your food for a while longer, yes, but stop at that. \nEven if/when she gets rid of the dog, thereafter when the subject of support / money comes up: Even when her phone stops working.    Every time she asks to borrow money or the car -- anything:  \"You need to support yourself.\"\n\nIf she's not taking care of the dog and buying food for it and feeding it and cleaning up after it and walking it, tell her to return it.  If/when she leaves you with it home alone to baby sit it,  then consider taking it to a shelter instead of you taking care of it or letting her neglect the dog.\n\nGood luck.",
            "What kind of dog is it? Hopefully not what's considered an aggressive breed i.e. Pitbull, Mastiff, German Shepherd, Rottweiler, Doberman, Akita etc. any of those breeds will usually disqualify people for a lot of apartment complexes. There's also high cost dogs that tend to have a lot more health problems than the average dog like dogs with flat snouts.",
            "Might get lost, but I was once that naive daughter who got a dog without really discussing with my parents while still on their dime. I got a job specifically to support all dog related expenses, as I needed to show them I could support the creature. I was away at school and not living with them, so as long as they didn\u2019t pay for anything they were good. \n\n\nThat being said, if your daughter is living with you, introducing an animal into the house without the consent of everyone is *asking* for trouble. I would set and keep very strict expectations for behavior (both her and the dog). Most first time dog owners do not realize the responsibility of training and care, especially if it\u2019s a puppy. Brand new puppies (8 weeks is the earliest usually) need to be watched carefully and most need to be taken out every 15-30 minutes for potty training to be successful.

Tell her flat out, she has to pay for everything regarding the dog. Food, training, cleaning, medical, the works. \n\nAside from this, if she's going to school full time, I completely see letting her get off without paying her rent or phone bill. If she's not, she should be doing something. If she's working and not in school, she should be paying rent.\n\nRespect is a two way street.

            "Here\u2019s the issue. You\u2019ve referred to her as a 20 year old kid. Stop viewing her as a kid, she\u2019s a grown woman and her priority was getting a dog, what she needs is a job. Stop crippling yourself over this grown child.",

            "Um when my child gets past 18, if he\u2019s in college, I\u2019ll cover most of the expenses. However, if they aren\u2019t in college they\u2019ll be paying the expenses they would be if they were on their own (assuming they\u2019re not under financial duress at the time).",
            "I am 21, living with parents and working. I pay for car fuel and repairs (I am the only one driving it for now). Also for one big family shopping every month where we buy food for all family. It's around 1/6 of what I earn for now.\nI am quite happy with this arrengment.",
            "I mean, I don't really agree that a twenty year old is a kid at all. That's an adult. but yea I would never charge my child any rent, unless they decided to stay at home and do nothing I guess.",

If I got my own let I would expect to pay for it myself.",
            "Last time my boomerrang son moved back in, I required him (mid 20s) to pay rent and so forth. Without telling him, I put it all into a separate account. Then when it came time to kick him out (again), I gave it all back. Eliminated all the excuses about 1st/last, security deposit, etc.\n\nI get the financially crippling part, so you might not have your own financial buffer to do this strategy.\n\nGood luck.",
            "Any you choose. I\u2019m 21 and live with my parents. I pay for half the electricity bill, my share of the phone bill, the wifi, all the streaming services (Netflix, Hulu, prime, HBO, Spotify) and for my share of my truck\u2019s insurance.",
            "It's all about negotiation. With my oldest son, I explained that we provide the basic tier. He gets a cell phone, not the newest shiniest phone. He gets a phone plan, not the top tier. He gets a car, not a brand new current year model. \n\nAnything that he wants in excess of the basics is on him. He wanted a newer phone so he bought it. He wanted unlimited everything on his plan so he pays for it. He wanted comprehensive car insurance instead of minimum coverage, so he pays it. \n\nRent, however, is not a thing. I added him as an authorized user on all of my credit cards when he turned 16. At 18, he got his own card, immediately. He came out of the gate with a 720 credit score and lives with us while he saves up enough for a large down payment on his own house. He will not ever waste money on rent, and when he does acquire his own home, he will get all of the basic tools needed to maintain it. Any additional tools he will buy.",
            "Im a recent grad and the general rules are that if you drive the car, you pay for the gas (and insurance if you have your own), I've paid my rent on my own for school and now I've moved back I pay \"rent\" to stay at home (~$200/mo granted applies only after I got a job) so that I can save but also incentivise moving out. \nGenerally if it wasn't something for the family or a treat, I'd pay for it since it's something I wanted. The phone bill however is \"paid for\" by my chore of taking care of the cats (one I've had since I was 8) so I'm not completely independent but hey I'll shovel cat shit to save $50.",
            "Be honest with her sit down and explain to her that this financial burden is crippling you. She needs to pay her share like cell phone ,insurance ,gas , and play money.  anything she wants she needs to provide that for herself.  She should also contribute some to food since she eats there this will teach her how to be a grown-up to pay her bills and to be responsible to the people she lives with.",
            "I\u2019d say you\u2019re doing a great job handling all expenses already. I don\u2019t think you fucked up at all. That\u2019s just my opinion because that\u2019s what I want to do for my kids when I have them. Not considering other family\u2019s opinions on something that would affect the entire household probably isn\u2019t the best thing. But if she\u2019s willing to take full responsibility for the dog then it sounds like you raised a kid who knows what they want and has the confidence and ability to take care of it. Which is a great thing! \nIf there\u2019s things that you want her to pay for I can understand cell phone and car insurance. I\u2019d tread carefully on the line of making your kid pay rent though, especially if you ever told them that you would never make them do that. If that is a rougher you want to go though take that money and put it into an account for them and give it back when they are ready to move out. Make sure you say that\u2019s what you\u2019re gonna do it\u2019ll help a lot. That\u2019s a big thing and can cause a huge rift in the relationship and that can be very hard to repair. Of course though, the final decision is up to you. You are the parent and how you decide to manage your household and interact with your kids is completely up to you. I don\u2019t know the ages of your kids but if your gonna make one pay for their cellphone bill or something I\u2019d think you\u2019d have to do the same with the other just so they don\u2019t feel like they are being singled out.  Best of luck to you!",
            "Honest reply I paid for everything that was directly linked to me. School, cellphone, car + insurance, etc.",
            "Account for of all the expenses you pay for your kid - let\u2019s say it\u2019s $500/mo for things like cell phone, insurance, etc.. instead of directly paying for these, give her the cash for them and make her pay them. You\u2019re still paying for it, but it builds the habit of managing that money and paying the bills. Then decrease the amount of money you\u2019re giving over the next 5 years until you cut the cord. \n\nThat\u2019s what my parents did and I\u2019m thankful they did it that way."

I'd prefer twenty, unneeded police situations swarming my kids school, over one actual school massacre that wasn't reported by someone else they said it to, in case they were \"joking\". It's a good thing. \n\nI don't live in the US, but if I did, there's not a chance in hell I'd send my kids to any school. It is so frightening to me the amount of times this has happened. They would also not be allowed to go to the shops. Or concerts. Just in public generally. It's very distressing to me. VERY DISTRESSING. \n\nI knew when the Sandy Hook massacre happened, that if little kids being slaughtered wasn't enough for a moratorium on the \"firearms for all\" situation, then nothing will ever change there and the problem was going to get even worse. At first, I was hopeful that this would be the catalyst for gun control and these poor kids didn't die in vain at the hands of an unhinged dickhead-but no. So upsetting.\n\nFuck the NRA and fuck anyone who sticks up for this archaic \"amendment\" like it's some god given right to own a cache of lethal weapons. Your arguments are invalid. You've all proven you aren't capable of controlling yourself with one, or more than one and you're just an arsehole at this point. \n\nThe complacency around them is unbelievable, \"kid finds a loaded, safety off handgun in the couch, next to the bed, in mum's handbag, pulls the trigger and shoots someone\" is a story I regularly see in the news. The amount of social media content of some muppet teen/s playing with guns and accidentally shooting the walls, the road rage incidents that escalate within seconds and then someone pulls a gun. A six year old takes one he finds laying around at home and shoots his teacher... I could go on, but I don't want to. My stomach is already sick. \n\nSo much unnecessary death. It's honestly absurd at this point, to continue to staunchly deny what the main cause of the problem is. You just sound crazy and like you actually enjoy these bloodbaths. \n\nOnly when those in power with the ability to make real changes are affected by a mass shooting of their children at their privileged schools or something, will this change. For now, they're all happy and willing to let those with less privilege, be sacrificed every other day, for the legal rights to own guns themselves. It's sickening.",

These studies cannot be used to assess whether the prevalence of gun ownership in the population affects overall homicide rates\"\n\"Although these studies suggest a relationship between gun ownership and homicide, they are severely limited because of inadequate adjustment for confounding factors\"\n*Incidence rate ratio\u2009=\u20091.009; 95% confidence interval\u2009=\u20091.004, 1.014.* (virtually no change)\n\nThe last was just an article, it was simply an opinion piece that links to several articles consistently showing with no solid basis to actually demonstrate hat gunowners are either disproportionately harmed with their own weapons or with commit a disproportionately higher percentage of crime.\nIt did, however, articulate an obvious need for people taking on the responsibility of carrying firearms to be trained in proper safety and to regularly practice proper shooting techniques.\n\n\nHe also tried to call me a piss baby basically, and told me I was crazy.\n\nThe first link was an Adobe acrobat file I can't find now\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8371731/\n\nhttps://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2013.301409\n\nhttps://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/how-the-good-guy-with-a-gun-became-a-deadly-american-fantasy",

            "I think its a shithole made of echochambers. Its a misinformation mill  that recursively references itself.",
            "It is when /r/catsubs is basically everything you're subbed to. Over time I unsub from stuff and more from that list. Not regretting the trend.",
            "I started my own little sub, after getting kicked out of so many. Yeah, the last week has been really wonderful. I seem to have fallen in with the right people; kind, articulate, and caring. It really is something to look forward to, even on the sorriest days. You're more than welcome to post there. r/homelessandalone\n\nNice to see the bright side of a media platform.",
            "Yes it's my small anonymous glimpse of social media, and the memes and shitposting that I'm addicted to.",
            "My free bear hug to you - keep up the good work!",
            "Yes, I like to go on r/amiugly and give people compliments.",
            "I am really selective about which subs I subscribe to and only ever look at my home page. As a result, reddit puts me in touch with lots of people who share my interests and during these lockdown times I find it constantly interesting and stimulating. Most of the subs I use are pretty low in numbers but that doesn't matter - it means I get to share stuff with fellow enthusiasts and I love that. \n\nI think that if I started looking at the default r/popular or r/all I would just get depressed by the number of idiots there are in the world.",
            "i do have stuff going on, and i found reddit as my go-to platform (next to youtube) just new here and been a great help to pass time\n\nhope u find the light at the end of the tunnel dude",

            "The world needs more of that kinda thing. You're a good person. Well done, sir or madam!\n\nThe world's pretty damn negative, which is enough reason to push out any positivity you can.",
            "The best thing I've done is to stop arguing and fighting with people and try to be positive and avoid the negative (I'm not perfect though done things still piss me off). I'm still having a rough time in life even though professionally I'm doing well. But it feels good if I can ease someone's suffering even just a little bit. I try to imagine a Buddhist approach to it, every little bit of suffering you can take on takes it away from someone else. And it also helps to just see everyone dogs and cats and other pets to put a smile on my face as well.",
            "I tend to do the same thing when I look at Reddit.  I think it\u2019s a good thing.  Spreading kindness when you can.  Some of the most depressed people try to make others smile and laugh, usually in hopes of making themselves feel better, or not wanting others to feel as low as they are because you understand how it feels.  So I completely understand and agree with what you are doing.",
            "Yeah honestly whenever my mind starts thinking about shit in my life that\u2019s making me sad af, I opened Reddit and scroll and read comments anf laugh my ass of and feel a whole lot better. I read some many comments about how negative Reddit is and how everyone\u2019s an asshole shit poster blah blah but I don\u2019t see that. I follow subs of similar interests  of my mine and read about people and their experiences that actually make me feel like I\u2019m not alone and there are a lot of people out there who I wish I knew in real life because they seem cool as hell and I wish they were my friends. I\u2019ve gone through one of the toughest years of my life emotionally and felt so unsupported by people in my life. But anytime I\u2019ve talked about my problems here there are been many many supportive kind people responding to me, making me feel heard and understood. I\u2019ve learned how to diet effectively, how to respond to situations better and see things from a more clear perspective. How it\u2019s ok to have boundaries and stand up for myself. How to react to narcissistic add holes around me in a way that I feel heard but can distance myself from letting it control my thoughts and my mood. I learned a bunch of study techniques for a class I took and it helped me pass my state exam. I fucking love Reddit and think it had helped me in so so many ways. It\u2019s the only social media I use because it\u2019s so cool to actually talk to real people from all around the world about so many different things and I think it\u2019s an awesome community. If Reddit is toxic, then they\u2019re probably just following subs that really aren\u2019t that great.",
            "Typically as long as you avoid the Popular tab and stick the subreddits you choose to subscribe to Reddit is great, it\u2019s when you start falling down the negativity rabbit holes that it starts to seem like every other social media",
            " No. I work afternoons so I kinda hear no news as I\u2019m asleep during the day and so I use Reddit to read catch-up on news and laugh. I generally see an ass ton of negativity on everything so I just ignore it and use Reddit for comic relief and to see cool shit whether it\u2019s new technology cars space rockets whatever the hell",

I was a scrolling stalker for a few weeks before taking the plunge and making an account. I love it bc you get info from basically every platform plus all the cute baby and animal pics and videos.",
            "I use it as an escape myself.  Career wise, I\u2019m fine, but I\u2019m in a crappy marriage that when I try to do the right things, it\u2019s never right.  So I get on and do the same things.  Give people positive reinforcement, give out my free awards and the one thing I never do is burden others with my own problems because that\u2019s not what I\u2019m here to do.  Please do me a favor and don\u2019t comment about my personal issues and ask me anything about it ok.",

            "You're awesome, thanks for existing. And for caring about other people feeling good even though your life is not perfect. That speaks highly of you, keep being awesome.",
            "For me reddit allows you to post an opinion and then have people upvote it or disagree with it, in any case there is a reply. I tried for years to get a following going on Twitter but it never happened. So reddit has become my new social media platform and I am very happy.",
            "Honestly Reddit is more negative and pessimistic than anything, I stay off Reddit if I need real world positivity. There are of course some feel good posts also!",
            "Kinda? It's mostly annoying for me though as I'm not left leaning politically so I feel I can't comment sometimes..",
            "Reddit has been my number one go-to for any advice that I\u2019m looking for. I didn\u2019t grow up with too many positive role models, but I have always been able to count on Reddit to help me learn how to tie a tie, change a tire, budget my finances, and how to create a resume. I owe so much gratitude to each and every one of you for getting me where I am in life today!",
            "Got rid of Facebook about two weeks ago and then realized I don't actually have real life friends so Reddit is my god now. I mostly lurk, obsessively upvote and try to stay away from the toxic parts.",
            "Yes.  And the kindness and humor in most of the subs I read.   I need to know it is still important and still treasured.",
            "Yes! I never look at the front page and only follow subs that make me happy, so reddit is a delightful escape for me :)",
            "thank you for your post. it actually meant a lot and was pretty inspiring.",

            "This is so relatable",
            "You my dear friend and kindred spirit have just described the salvation of the world. \n\nThe only problem is, it's too easy so people don't believe it. Maybe it's because all our bedtime stories and movies and great books are about heroic people doing heroic things. \n\nLegendary things. Things so unbelievable that they MUST be the real answer. They become vastly entertaining to enjoy and pass on to the next generation but the REAL truth is a lot less dramatic. \n\nIt's not one big amazing thing .... it's a billion little acts of kindness.\n\nTHAT is how we, the ordinary everyday shmucks of the world, save the world. \n\nBy being nice.",
            "Same. You can find entire communities of people that are interested in the exact same things as you. Right now I can\u2019t say that for real life. Tried to convince my friends over and over to watch a certain TV show and they refuse to watch it even when they complain about having nothing to watch. Well luckily there is a community dedicated to the show here with thousands of people happy to engage in discussion.",

That whole time I thought it was a famous quote, when I looked it up to find the source it turned out it was an original post made by a Reddit user like you. What you do definitely makes a difference",
            "as sad as it sounds, lately reddit has always been the one to pick me up. When I'm depressed I'd ramble on here and there's always about a dozen of people giving thoughtful replies. I have friends who love me but they have their own lifes and I hate to intrude so it's nice that reddit can be a substitute",
            "I think in this specific scenario you're the beacon @OP \ud83d\ude09",
            "Thank you.",
            "Yeah..I do this a bit.\n\nMostly I try to be civil an friendly. The only time I may get a bit aggro is if someone is rude or insulting to me; then I may fire back.\n\nBut when I see people posting their weight loss pics or family pics or their art or their game...I always encourage them. And why not. They deserve it.\n\nA month ago a guy I had been talking to a few months back contacted me. He'd made a reddit post about feeling suicidal because he felt he had no interests, no friends etc. I'd talked to him for a while and given him some suggestions....and he said it changed his life and wanted to thank me. He no longer wanted to die, and felt his life had improve.\n\nIn turn, the thought that I really made a difference to someone...even if it was just by talking to someone....really gave me a boost too. \n\nSo...be as nice as you can. Like op here.  Times are tough too for many people...",

What do I mean?\n\nJohn Barnetts testimony to Congress had concluded in 2019 with the resulting FAA mandates implemented that same year at Boeings 787 facility. The \u201ctestimony\u201d John was in the midst of *was an appeal for a previously rejected defamation lawsuit* against Boeing - which is notably, NOT whistleblowing. Not only had he already given his testimony the previous two days (and was only pending cross examination), but he hadn\u2019t even suggested he had new information to reveal as he had he not worked for Boeing since 2017.\n\nAs for this individual, he was not a \u201cBoeing whistleblower\u201d. He was a **Spirit AeroSystems** whistleblower (a company that suppliers both Boeing and Airbus) and who **died from pneumonia compounded with MRSA he got while at the hospital** - not some strange mystery as some keep suggesting.\n\nSo if Boeing is killing past whistleblowers, and a guy working for a *supplier*.. and they are doing it to \u201cscare\u201d others.. it won\u2019t effectively scare anyone in the industry because their deaths are so *clearly* not hit jobs. An ambiguous scare tactic that assassinated uninvolved people?\n\nAnd they\u2019d have to scare (or kill) 32 more of them. \n\nhttps://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/4/19/boeing-subject-of-32-whistleblower-complaints-documents-reveal",

            "While these cases are sad, they likely aren't some grand conspiracy to silence whistle-blowers.\n\nThe first death was a suicide and while yes, people see that and immediately think \"Suuuuuuree, that whistleblower just happened to suicide himself, riiiiiiiight\" the reality is that whistleblower had already blown the whistle several years prior and the court case he was involved in was a libel case dealing with proceedings from the case he informed for. He wasn't holding onto information that was going to shed new light on stuff, he was in civil litigation. While it was reported he'd said he wouldn't kill himself, that came from a second hand report from a family friend, his actual spouse wasnt suprised by his suicide and noted that'd he'd been depressed.\n\nIn the second case, the guy had pneumonia and contracted a disease resistant form of staph in the hospital, which killed him. Obviously, that sucks, but that kind of death from medical complications in hospitals arnt unheard of. The guy was also part of a supply subcontractor for Boeing, and again, his case had already been resolved.\n\nNow, obviously, given all the shady crap Boeing has pulled recently in terms of corporate practice, it's easy to look at all this and see conspiracy. Hell, plenty of people on reddit are ready to believe that the government is in cahoots with Boeing to cover up this stuff. Right now, the main thought online is that Boeing is killing whistleblowers to intimidate others from coming forward. But realistically, that doesn't make sense. \n\nThe public didn't know who these two guys were or what they blew the whistle on in Boeing until they died. If Boeing wanted to intimidate witnessess from coming forward and keep this out of the public eye they dont need to kill people, they just have to do the standard corporate thing of tying up all the issues and cases in court and other legal limbos and make life annoying and uncomfortable for the people who blow the whistle. That, more than anything, is arguably what killed these guys. The whistleblower who committed suicide had been stuck in legal proceedings for years, which can take a toll on folks' mental health. I'm not framiliar with the 2nd guys case as throughly, but if he'd been stuck in some kind of legal issues due to blowing the whistle, then those kind of stresses can weaken a bodys immune system making one more susceptible to infection.\n\nObviously, nothing is 100% certain, but realistically, the stresses from being stuck in legal battles with Boeing probably is what most likely killed these two whistleblowers, not shadowy assassin's working on Boeing's dime.",
