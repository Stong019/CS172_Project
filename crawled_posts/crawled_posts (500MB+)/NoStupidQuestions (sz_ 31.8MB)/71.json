            "Most of these physical jobs are not working large muscle groups to a point near failure, which is needed to really develop muscle hypertrophy.  Diet and recovery are also essential to build a muscular physique.  You will find a lot of these trades have above average grip strength due to the repetitions performed with their hands at work.  They also aren't typically moving very heavy loads with their bodies enough to actually build maximum strength either.  They are also working at least five days a week so even if they were moving heavy loads enough or getting muscles to the point of failure, they wouldn't recover well enough to really see results.  The stereotypical diet is energy drinks, gas station food, mountain dew, fast food, and light beer.  None of that is going to produce a muscular frame, but rather a big stomach to park behind the steering wheel of their RAM.",
            "If you want to build big muscles in a body builder/buff movie star way simple physical work won't do much. You'll need to systematically push your muscles to their limits. Something like construction work won't push your body so far.\n\nPeople with physically demanding jobs who don't work out will be stronger (and probably much stronger) than a person who sits in an office 8 hours a day and don't work out, but they won't have the 9-14% body fat needed to look shredded.",

Not to mention there are probably other dietary factors or supplements they consider when your goal is to build muscle.\n\nMe, I was just a guy showing up to make a buck, and it doesn't matter how often I moved equipment, because that equipment always weighted the same, so at a certain point your body feels like its built an appropriate amount of muscle to move an object of a certain weight and stops building muscle.",

            "Training for hypertrophy works because you are lifting weights so heavy you can only do it ten to twelve times. This signals your body to build more muscle tissue as well as to put more glycogen and water into the tissue you have. Doing something that does not cause muscle failure in forty or so seconds signals your body to keep the amount of muscle smaller so it can more efficiently remove lactic acid and other waste products from your muscles.",

They could have grips that would break your bones, and you\u2019d never know it cause they have a beer belly and some chub.",
            "The popular image of what \"strong\" men look like isn't the result of strength. It comes from ultra low fat diets, and dehydrating yourself for camera day. Strong muscles aren't visible by default, it takes extra work, that has nothing to do with being strong, for that to happen. Take a look at strong man competitions, as opposed to body builders. You won't see a cut muscle in the crowd, but they can lift way more than any muscle model could.",
            "Most of the people doing this physical work are reasonably strong, but they both have extra body fat and really aren't lifting completely insane amounts of weight.  Also odds are they aren't eating high protein diets to develop the advanced musculature you see in bodybuilders and powerlifters.  \n\nKeep in mind too that our perception of muscular men is skewed by a fitness and entertainment industry completely filled with steroids.  If you want to see what a lean, muscular, non steroid assisted body looks like then look at UFC or other combat sports which have REALLY strict drug testing, or even Olympic weightlifting.  The Rock, the Avengers, pro wrestlers and many pro athletes?  It's crazy genetics, hard work, and a LOT of steroids. \n\nThe guys at the construction site would probably pass as journeymen weightlifters absent any extra activity, minus a few exceptions that are really muscular.",
            "Bodybuilding is kind of a cheat. You are directly targeting very specific muscles with the absolute optimal amount of reps, with planned progressive weight increases, with an optimal diet specifically to grow these muscles, with an optimal amount of rest and a routine that prevents over training.\n\nIt's not easy, but its 100x easier than reaching those goals any other physical way.",
            "Also, bodyfat percentage has a lot to do with it.",

            "I was a stone cutter and this skinny 130lb man would use a sledge hammer and chisel like nothing. I tried next ...and man this guy had the strength of a 200lb plus man easily. I was taller and bigger muscle wise but couldnt keep up with him and he used heavy ass water saws all day.. Just like when u meet an older women shake her hand and she has an strong as grip...diff muscle groups don't show as much but are lean and strong.Never judge a book by its cover makes perfect sense here.",
            "It is partly to do with muscle fiber types. Slow twitch muscle fibers are what we use for endurance activities. Think of a lean marathon runner. Fast twitch muscle fibers are what we use for fast explosive lifting that ends quickly. Think of a body builder. When you are working all day long your body is going to build up more slow twitch fibers, sacrificing overall force production for endurance. \n\nAdditionally, getting large muscles requires serious dedication and more importantly specification. You want big biceps? You need to repeatedly work the biceps and isolate to only work the biceps. Most manual jobs require the person to do more \u201cglobal\u201d movements where multiple muscles work together in concert to achieve the task. \n\nFinally, getting the have larger cross sectional muscles requires serious caloric and nutritional intake. Most people doing manual jobs have long hours and aren\u2019t eating 5000 calories and a dozen eggs during their shift. \n\nObviously I\u2019m making some sweeping generalizations that don\u2019t apply to everyone.",
            "It\u2019s a lot more efficient to do lifts/exercises that are targeted towards specific muscle groups. That and people who go to the gym are probably more likely to take their diet very seriously as well, which is like 80% of the battle tbh",
            "A lot of that is general fitness plus mental work. I am a fatass. My wife is skinny. I Can walk uphill in a mountainous forest for hours upon hours without food or water or breaks. She can\u2019t. Why? Because i have endurance despite my weight, I\u2019ve walked and hiked my whole life, and it\u2019s something I do to challenge myself. It\u2019s like a job for me and I make sure I do my long challenging hikes. \n\nA lot of those guys may not be bulky, but they are still fit and mentally prepared to do the job and have experience. Plus i promise you a lot of those guys are muscular and lean. Look at someone like Bruce Lee. With his clothes on he looks scrawny but every square inch of his body is muscle. They are also lifting moderately heavy things all day in small amounts. To get bulky and muscular you have to do it deliberately. They are doing the equivalent of doing 50 reps of light weights, as opposed to a body builder who might do 10 super heavy weights at one time",
            "The muscular look that you get from lifting is an aesthetic. You don't get like that just from doing hard labor jobs, you gotta do the specific movements in the gym designed to build those muscles with the right weights, supported by a proper diet.",
            "Bodybuilders give a distorted view of real strength. Go watch a world strongest man competition. They don't look like bodybuilders.",
            "People in gyms work out by using weights in inefficient ways.  People with physical jobs figure out how to do physical work in the most comfortable/effective way they can.\n\nLike I remember reading a magazine interview for some bodybuilder and he explained how he couldn't help his wife move furniture around because he was so dedicated to his min/maxing that he couldn't spare the calories doing things like that.  He was trying to show how dedicated he was to his craft",
            "Back when I worked construction I was cut\n \nBut it wasn't obvious just looking at me\n \nBasically; You tone up, not bulk up",
            "A lot of us grew up farming; I grew up produce farming in the Midwest. Carrying boxes of kale and lettuce and fertilizer will make you strong. I used to load the fertilizer drill by carrying a 50 lb bag on each shoulder, throwing them onto the hopper which was over my head and cutting them open; then repeat 9 times. I moved 30' long 3\" irrigation pipe across fields for hours on end. I dug ditches by hand across fields. I unloaded pallets weighing over a ton off a truck with a pallet jack. Huge muscle isn't necessary for strength, strong muscles that work everyday will always outperform. I'm 45 and I can work circles around the young guys when we pour concrete. Pouring stairs? I'll carry 4 five gallon buckets of concrete up the stairs at a time and pass the gym rat struggling to carrying one bucket. Most days, I'm fueled by caffeine, nicotine, and hatred.",
            "Working man's strength is usually stronger than big muscle strength.",
            "It's because of how the body adapts to stimulus. The body attempts at all times to use the most efficient movement patterns that use the least amount of energy because that's survival. Bodybuilding specifically targets muscle groups in the most *innefcient* way possible to force a hypertrophic muscular response. Contractors are strong, they just may or may not be jacked.",

            "As a gay man, sorry but no. Men can be just as beautiful or bangable as women can, and not just the ultra-coiffed, primped and plucked gay-inspired variety of man either. In fact I often find that a turn-off. Some guys are just perfect despite their plumber's arse or their hairy back or their weird toenails. You know that feeling you get for ultra-hot girls? I get it for guys, and often very surprising guys compared to what is sociallly considered attractive. \n\nI personally think OP's viewpoint is a harmful one (no criticism, no shade), because the number of men I've thought were beautiful who had been told many times that they were ugly or repellent is staggering. And the thing about it is that almost none - perhaps even none - of the men I've thought were near-perfect were wearing any makeup. Not to imply that women wear makeup because they're ugly, because there are a few reasons people but it's a bit insane when one gender is told to fix everything about themselves with makeup and another gender is being told that they're \"ugly asf\" but they're just like that so give up.\n\nMen are hot. Even if you've never looked in the mirror and seen \"attractiveness\" (\"attractiveness\" is a VERY narrow ideal in popular society, but that doesn't represent the truth of who all individual people find attractive, so it means nothing to lots of real people if you're not some chiselled hunk), there's a chance that I, or someone like me, has looked at you and wished you were theirs. \n\nMargot Robbie is not allowed to be called \"mid\", but calling men much worse has been so normalised that nobody even challenges it anymore. Please, believe a gay guy who has spent his entire life in love with the guys only women actually get to have. Lots of y'all are just as beautiful as women. You just can't always see it yourself. Take it from me, though: there are almost no men in existence who don't have at least one thing about them which is beautiful or attractive. Their ears, their voice, their sense of humour, their face, their taste in books, the way they slurp cheese out of bowl full of melted cheese; almost anything can be the lynchpin which holds their interest in you until they learn more things about you they like. But that's all about whole-character stuff, not just looks, so I'll shut up about it now.\n\nThe only thing you really need to remember is that you just can't see it. If you're not sexually interested in men, there will be aspects of that attraction in others which you won't be able to understand by trying to see it from your own perspective, because your body is not built to do so, and even if it was, and you were gay, there's no guarantee they'd be your type specifically.",

They love that we have fairly strong arms and a chest, they love the happy trails, they love our hands that while we probably hate they like something that can grab them during playtime. They like the roughness of our beards and they also like our boyish features.

In fact let's just stop shitting on any/all genders while we are at it. Also a lot of y'all are showing your immature takes. As people mature they tend to enjoy the things that come with it but on the opposite sex.

I know modern media disagrees with me, but I am a big fan of pheromones and men smelling like men (I mean, I don't mean 3-day-old stand sweat, I mean the 20-minute-old sheen from some recent physical activity). A subtle cologne on top is nice, but pair-bonding involves the reality of how people actually smell at different points during the day. \n\nYou make stupid jokes and laugh at them. Sometimes I'm laughing with you, sometimes I'm laughing at how delighted you are by your own joke.\n\nSome of you can cook a fabulous marinara sauce with meatballs out of this world, or you can hunt, butcher, marinate, and cook a venison haunch with bacon and onions, or can help a lady build some raised beds and climbing racks.\n\nSome of you won't hesitate to try to solve our problems as soon as we mention them. \n\nOh, and beards. Tools!\n\nBut then yeah, some of you game way too much, to the point you're ignoring your lives and the people around you. Not sexy. Food stains on your t-shirt, dragon breath, and swamp ass will not work in your favor.  Women will not be attracted to that, and even after you match up, if you can't control it, it will become an issue.

Men laughing, dancing, holding you, having swoopy, floppy, or curly hair, when men dress nicely or talk about something they're excited about, when men have kind of furrowed eyebrows, when men roll up their sleeves, when men are taller or stronger than me, especially if they have visible muscle definition, that look men give you when they're just really enjoying the moment and don't have other expectations. Strong hands, muscular thighs, nice butt, nice shoulders and pectoral muscles...\n\nThat said, women are 1000% less likely to do something that turns me off. I like a lot of the same things about women as I do about men (tall, muscular, etc.), but I'd say I have good interactions with 98% of women I am interested in or who are interested in me, but only with about 50% of men who are interested in me. Women almost never make me uncomfortable, which actually gives me the space to think of them as attractive and decide I want to do things with them.",

I find male faces to be handsome and attractive, male deep voices sound very nice, I like the muscles and definition of the male body, I like hair on those bodies. And of course male genitalia are scrumptious-looking and arouse the kind of hunger I\u2019d have for a cheese-cake but without the calories (all but the calories and protein of an egg).  I like the strength of male arms and how they feel around my waist. I feel safe and I feel like I can learn from the average man, whereas women\u2019s psyche is too clouded by emotion (same goes for men that are too emotional, it\u2019s unattractive and woman-like). I like pondering about the male psyche and I am ever curious of their sexuality, though mine might match the average male, so I can\u2019t speak for all women. And I like male hands, the same hands that operate heavy machinery can also touch my body in gentle ways, again, Very sexual and sensual.\n\nWomen on the other hand are pretty and cute the way pet cats or flowers are pretty, but not something that stirs my sexual desires. You can decorate a lady like you\u2019d decorate your favorite room in the house, but again, not a sexually-appealing thing."

            "\u201cJenny, I love our friendship and respect your beliefs.  I\u2019ve attended your church and can see that it means a lot to you.  I think that\u2019s wonderful and encourage you to follow your beliefs.  \n\nBut Ive decided it\u2019s not for me and i won\u2019t be attending again.   \nI hope you will respect my decision and this won\u2019t interfere in our friendship.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou don\u2019t have to feign a different view of religion (when you don\u2019t have one) or use biblical verses (that have no meaning for you) against her. You don\u2019t have to list out what it is about the church you don\u2019t agree with.   \n\nSimply put, you don\u2019t have to justify or defend your decision.  \nYou can respect her beliefs while politely stating they aren\u2019t yours.   \n\nIf she is unable to accept or respect that, then that is an issue she is going to have to overcome.",

            "Source: I'm a Pastor. You can definitely tell her you are not interested and she should accept it. If she doesn't, or gets upset, you should understand the motivation behind it. I would be she has a deep-rooted fear that you are separated from God and will be into eternity. Whether or not you believe that, she does, and she fears for you (I am guessing). \n\nIf you wanted to deepen the relationship, it might be good to ask, \"why is it so important to you that I go to church?\" I am sure she wants to persuade you that Jesus is the savior, but does not want to have such a straightforward discussion herself. For decades American Christianity has substituted such straightforward discussion with invitations to religious events. I would imagine her real concern is not that you go to church, but that you do not know her God. Maybe shift the conversation to that - why you do/do not believe - as it might lessen the pressure to go to church. \n\nIt does not surprise me or upset me that someone who does not believe what I do does not come to my church. Why would they? If I want them to come, I would need to persuade them to believe what I believe first, not dupe them into joining our fellowship",

She invited me to a campus church called Church of Christ. After about the third time she asked and I declined politely she turned up the heat. One day I was riding the bus and a stranger struck up a conversation, not unusual at college, but then the conversation turned to of I went to church and have I heard of Church of Christ. I noped off that bus at the next stop. Later that week someone asked if they could sit at the cafeteria table I was at, also not unusual, same conversation started. So I had to confront her about this essentially harassment by a cult. I asked her if this was a tactic they use.

I appreciate you thinking highly of me and offering the chance to go with you to Disney, but I think I will pass. Please, don't take it as me saying I don't like you.

Just a thought to keep in mind that while she will be aware of your lack of desire to attend, inviting you to church may always be something she does.

A huge part of life is feeling vulnerable to the fact you may be rejected or disappoint someone. That's where personal growth and sense of self is strengthened. If you lie, it will likely blow up down the road and damage the relationship you have further. It also creates a false relationship with the person you're with, and they won't truly know you, your motives, your feelings, etc. You become what you think they want you to be. So just validate her position, and politely assert yours. \"I truly appreciate you inviting me to your church and church qctivitiest.

But right now, I'm not sure what I believe and not sure if this particular church is right for me. I need to find myself and be truly invested in my beliefs. It's not right to partially commit to Faith \"\n\nThat should cover the bases, and if she doesn't accept that, you've identified her true self and can assess how you feel about the relationship with her. Finding out someone doesn't accept you for who you are and your beliefs could save a lot of trouble down the road. If she does accept you, you've strengthened your relationship with her and she'll really appreciate honesty. The more you lie to protect someone else's feelings, the more chips you take out of your sense of self. Just be you and be sure to validate the other person's position and you're golden.",

Reddit, using oauth for instance, requires an authorization token gained by actual password authentication if you want to post as a specific user / do authenticated things.

One could conceivably extend this and suppose he comes with a new one every day to create a *PS I love you* scenario in the future (I'm sorry all my references are from cheesy movies but bear with me). The latter, though, would be something actually left in his will (which we don't have) so it's not that good an analogue.\n\nThe question then is: under what circumstance(s) could Doc's letter(s) be cancelled?

The analogue of the tracking number here is, of course, the specific bot and intercepting here would be disabling their access to the twitter account.\n\nHowever, note that USPS requires you to log in; the real-world analogue would be presenting an ID to prove you're the sender. If you show a driver's license with the right name but you don't match the photo, the employee is at their discretion to refuse. You get around this by presenting a Power of Attorney saying you are authorized to act on this person's behalf (or, since it *is* at the employee's discretion, you could just explain the situation to them). What is the online analogue for a Power of Attorney? \"They gave me their password\"\n\nWriting the password down where you can see it / find it, legally, is equivalent to handing it to you (real-world analogue would be hanging a key on the wall), so you *have* their authorization.\n\nYou should be fine.",

I change my IP address and location often, and basically every time I log in to some sites, I'm having to respond to a stupid confirmation e-mail or SMS. \n\nIt's effectively two-factor authentication you can't opt out of, and your case is one I wish they had considered before implementing it.\n\nCheck with the executor of his estate and read his will.

When going through who he followed on instagram, I noticed he was following a lot of Andrew Tate pages. When I confronted him about it, and asked if he supported him, he said yes, because Tate was teaching him to be an 'alpha.' This immediately threw me off, but I've known this guy for a few years and I don't want to throw it away over something like this. When I tried to talk more about it, he told me to drop it and not to worry about it, which obviously rang a lot of warning bells in my head. I'm keeping him at arms length for now, but he's moving back to town in a few weeks and I'm concerned for both myself and him, since the area I live in is filled with negative people that would just cement his thinking. Should I just drop him? This opportunity is genuinely a dream come true for me, but he's shown way too many red flags so far that it feels kinda hopeless.\n\nEdit: I'm going to avoid him for a while, and only talk to him if he starts the conversation. I won't be pursuing a relationship with him, I didn't really want a relationship with him to begin with. Thank you so much to everyone who has commented and helped me out, I didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did.Everyone telling me to run, the moment I see any hint of misogyny or sexism, I'll be blocking him. He still has access to me via facebook messenger, so if he wants to talk to me at all, to apologise or otherwise, he can do it through there. As far as I know he's still moving to town, and if he wants to be friends I'll be fine with that, but he'll have to endure the 'friend test.' My best friend is an amazing judge of character, and they will be making a verdict once they meet him in person.I hope that he can see the error in following such a person, and once the heat dies down I'll be sending him some examples of better men to look up to (i.e. Jack Black, Markiplier, Daz Black, Jacksepticeye etc.) Any other respectful men I can send over to him as a better father figure would be greatly appreciated.Thank you so much to everyone who has helped me made a decision, I appreciate the concern and genuine advice everyone has given me. Hopefully he's not active on reddit and doesn't see this, that'd be an interesting conversation.  \n\n\nSECOND EDIT!  \nI messaged him asking if I can just be a mate, and play video games and just be chill, and he immediately turned it into a pity party, blamed me for him being depressed, threatened me, said I was 'nothing compared to him' and said he was going to send members from a gang after me. I have the entire conversation screenshotted, and will keep them if I have to file a police report.   \nHe couldn't handle me actually having a backbone I guess.",

Pregnant coworker jogged out of the way since he wouldn't slow down, and he swerved toward her still. She could feel the wind of the car so strongly. He glared at her and flipped her off after almost hitting her.

Wanting to be more masculine or be more accountable/ dependable in different ways is one thing, and if you like that, cool. No judgement at all. But the alpha, \"high value man\" standards that's spewed typically, is aggression, stubbornness, and dependent on monetary value. This is extremely shallow and sad to me that this is the example he wants to follow. If you continue, maybe introduce him to respectable men in your life that could be a good example for him and be a support system.",

            "I definitely get nostalgia mixed with existential dread. Scares me that time goes by so fast and so many things are in the past that can no longer be accomplished or fixed or brought back. People that passed away, my youth, the time to accomplish things I want to accomplish.\n\nNostalgia makes me not just appreciate or remember fondly, it also makes me sad that I'm no longer there and so much has transpired.",

            "Assuming that the memories weren't themselves of bad times-\n\nIf your nostalgia is related to past happiness but still makes you sad, there is a Portugese term called 'saudade' that might resonate with what you are feeling.\n\nFrom the [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudade):\n\n>Saudade is a deep emotional state of nostalgic or profound melancholic longing for an absent something or someone that one cares for and/or loves. ...  It is the recollection of feelings, experiences, places, or events that once brought excitement, pleasure,  and well-being, which now trigger the senses and make one experience the  pain of separation from those joyous sensations.\n\nIt is best described in English as \"bittersweet nostalgia\". Personally I think it sounds more on the sad side, but a major component of saudade specifically is optimism despite the sadness.\n\nPerhaps it is more like: allowing yourself to feel sad nostalgia, feeling the sorrow, then taking a deep breath and moving on anyway.\n\nIf you are getting lost in nostalgia and feeling only lament and sorrow- assuming, again, that you are not specifically remembering things that were bad for you- maybe you can use the concept of saudade to pursue the optimism that will allow you to have closure on those thoughts and move on when you get stuck in them.",

I tell myself The past is in the past and to pay any mind to it is to make yourself suffer needlessly.  Your childhood isn't gone,  it never existed, adults are all just really big kids.   there was nothing inherently better about the past.  The times haven't changed,  you have.   it's easier to be cynical now but if you choose,  it can be just as easy to find happiness as it was then.   Nothing is lost, there's no 'point to life' that you're missing, we're all just here for the ride anyway.  try to make the most of it in the moment. \n\n\nthat may not all be true,  but convincing myself it is helps me.",

            "Absolutely - this was something I struggled with even in my formative years. All I can say is that as I moved forward and forged new memories I started to realise I was living moments I would eventually feel the same way about - it gave me a sense of beauty inside the sorrow.   \n\n\nIf you're struggling with the same I would suggest trying to center yourself around the good times - not easy given current circumstances, but as aul Dumby says, happiness can be found in even the darkest places, if only we remember to turn on the light.",

            "Yes, usually it starts when I hear a song from childhood/youth I haven't heard in years. Instinctively I try to swallow, but nothing goes in, instead I feel this whomp! in my chest and expect it to cave in.\n\nI think I had too great of a childhood like a jackpot win and it is really challenging to feel new highs instead you steadily glide in land of contentment.",
            "Nostalgia is particularly difficult, when I remember happy periods I just feel sad, because I start yearning for the way things used to be. At least when I remember particularly bad times in my past I can feel slightly happy because remembering them reminds me that things got better  and that my past self had a lot to look forward to. Remembering happier times is painful.",
            "I think nostalgia can be a very toxic and intoxicating process and experience. Overall, I think it\u2019s a negative practice that I\u2019ve worked for to engage in less and less. The past can be remembered in a very inaccurate and edited way, and often focusing on it detracts from our ability to be present in the living  moments we have.",
            "Some it is because people have different interpretations of nostalgia. Or at least, \\*I\\* have several different nostalgias or past-sicknesses. The innocuous nostalgia about childhood/teenhood stuff you also see on r/nostalgia etc. is one thing. I enjoy it, but I don't really feel it that often, and crucially, I don't actually think this was a better time of my life or lamenting that I am not living \"simply\" like that anymore. I don't even find the \"children/teen's (pop -)culture\" or everyday life as a middle/high schooler more appealing than my regular current interests. So my total evaluation of this period of my life is \"I am glad it's over\", despite me actually having a positive/endearing view on its actual (pop-)cultural elements. But I see how one can easily find it more appealing than one's adult life.\n\nThen there is another kind of past-sickness, which is kinda the opposite of nostalgia if you think about it: you lament how *little* has changed, despite many years having passed. Like, your everyday life and your interests n years ago were so deceptively the same, but you of course have changed -- you are older, maybe less naive, maybe more cynical. So in this case of nostalgia you are not actually nostalgic about your past interests/everyday life, but rather the opposite, you are nostalgic for your past body and mental constitution and the sameness of the interests/life serves to underline the \"anti-nostalgic\" feeling. It still feels like nostalgia, just for yourself rather than your surrounding circumstances, and in this case it really does make me depressed.",

            "I have had an extremely blessed and wonderful life.  I feel exactly as you described OP.  I can\u2019t look at old photographs of my kids or, well any old photos because it makes me so nostalgic in a deeply depressing way for the past. A strong sense of how great life was back then and even though it\u2019s still great it will never be that great again.",
            "yes",
            "Yes, I've heard it called melancholy before, if not more sorrowful. For me, it can start out as this warm and fuzzy feeling, as I smile and relive memories. But then it hits me that those moments are gone forever and all I have are the memories, and the melancholy and grief strike.",
            "Yeah it\u2019s a bit of both for me. I got recommended an old video that was called \u201cGoodbye 2010!\u201d And for some reason I felt this sadness. I then started to cry because it made me realise that time is moving way too fast and it made me wish I could go back to a time before 2021 so I could just be a kid again. I had to stop watching the video half way through it cause I just couldn\u2019t stand it any longer. Cause honestly these days I have feelings of loneliness and I have a very boring life. I still have friends from school and all but it just doesn\u2019t feel the same anymore and tbh I can\u2019t be myself around them anymore. I don\u2019t want to grow up and become an adult. \n\nHowever on the other hand, we can\u2019t always wonder what could be. I know it might be hard and it might even be just difficult to do anything in general but we should all try to live our lives a little and make the most of it while we still have it. The past is in the past and it\u2019s hard I know, but you just have to live in the here and now. You only live once so make the most of it. \n\n(Sorry to go all preachy and stuff but I know what you mean. Nostalgia is bittersweet for me personally cause I made a lot of friends at school and had some fun memories but I also got bullied and I had a lot of trust issues I was (and still am) way to scared about what could happen and what could go wrong.

            "Yes. I think part of the reason is I hate the thought of getting older and growing up. The youngest we\u2019ll ever be is this moment right now and that gives me the worst anxiety.",
            "It very much depends on what is causing the nostalgia. I see a lot of comments from people saying they had normal or good childhoods and feel this. Mine was traumatic, and I have very strong positive and negative nostalgia. Negative feelings coke with most reminders of my childhood with the exception of the thi gs that soothed me as a child, which give me immense positive nostalgia, such as my comfort movies.",
            "Yes. I believe this is part of nostalgia- I\u2019m pretty sure the vast majority of people feel this (I could be wrong though). \n\nPersonally though, I don\u2019t actually feel the positives of nostalgia. I don\u2019t feel any happiness or any calming/relieving feeling like you mentioned. Just a weird type of sadness and wishing that I was there (in the past) again.",
            "Oh gosh yes. Regret for not having lived my life like I could have. Pain from remembering the one person who was always on my side and that much of my nostalgia is linked to, worry about how much worse my next 30 years will be. I hate it.",
            "Yes. Mine just feels sad",
            "The older I get the sadder nostalgia gets.  I think the reason is that when I was younger I had the chance to redo the things from my past and actually return there for a time.  Since I didn't have to work I had almost no worry, my time was mine at least in summer.  So for example I could sit around eating snacks, watching cartoons and playing old games without a care in the world.  Now time flies by and I always have to think about consequences, like my health and whatnot.

Every memory ends up circling back to the painful rather than the pleasurable. \n\nIf I think of my childhood home, I try to focus on the fun we had playing in the yard and the creek, but I always move to awful memories where I got hurt or embarrassed or yelled at. \n\nI think the human mind is wired to avoid physical pain and the emotional pain of being ostracized by replaying the mistakes you made in your past on an endless loop. Those memories of pain end up being warnings to avoid future pain. And the longer you live the more of this memory of pain builds up, and the harder it is to remember your past without getting hurt.",

I had a fun job, a cool place to live, a healthy relationship, a solid group of friends, etc. So, I went through old photos and listened to music from the time I lived there just to feel something. And although I was trying to re-live my \u201cglory days,\u201d it made me really sad that I no longer have any of it (except the friends, they\u2019re just far away now). \n\nAnd as sad as that all made me feel, it was still kind of a nice reminder that life can put really beautiful things your path sometimes.

            "My impression is that \u201cnostalgia\u201d is by definition a sort of bittersweet feeling, at best wistful sadness that you aren\u2019t in the good times anymore, but in recent years the meaning of the word has been muddled by corporate media trying to capitalize on things people have fond memories of from their youth (eg gen X being excited about the pop culture references in Stranger Things). \n\nThere\u2019s also the matter of remembering times that were sad, lonely, or even traumatic.

To be honest, understanding my odds for a better future and what it really looks like for me does the same thing. It doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t continue to work for something better or stop my efforts to obtain certain goals, it just means that I understand it won\u2019t be ideal and could\u2019ve been better.",

She was 58 at the time and my closest friend, a wonderful mother and talented teacher. Time has helped although it took me quite a few years. What I discovered was that I was re-living my last days with her, not the many happy memories we shared. I have read that thoughts do actually change neurological paths in your brain. Your brain cannot tell the difference between your memories and the actual event. As a result every time I remembered my 93 yr. old dad sitting beside her and holding her hand while she was near death, it is as if that moment was happening again. I have recently learned to \"change the channel\" in my mind any time I catch myself leaning toward the dark side. \n\n--And I remember a little quote a hospice volunteer sent me after Martha died. It said \"Remember that your loved one's pain has ended. Yours is just beginning.\" That was certainly true, but even the worst pain ends eventually, and we are finally  left with peace.",

When I look at my mum I see her greying hair, I see the pain that lines my grandparents' faces, and the rosy tint of childhood is gone and I see things for what they are now.

            "Oh abso-fucking-lutely.\n\nThere's a whole host of reasons nostalgia doesn't feel good for me the majority of the time, but there's one that really sticks out. It's that besides some isolated cool ass moments here and there, my childhood felt fucking horrible. An autistic boy surrounded by people who really don't know how to properly talk to him or treat him, let alone he fact that barely anyone even wanted to at the time or cared, my fun shit didn't come for a good while.\n\nPeople did and said shit to me I can never forget, I did shit I had to take at least 10 years to forgive myself for (not just the standard embarrassing stuff, I became a bully in reaction to the bullies who filled my life), I love my life *now* so much more than I'll ever love my formative years. I don't hate them and I wouldn't change them if given the chance because it helped to give me some much needed perspective to treat people and myself as well as I do today, but most of it's really not something to celebrate.\n\nAnd that's before you even get into how the majority of the stuff other people my age are nostalgic about I never got to experience for one reason or another.\n\nThe present has a lot of shit to complain about and be upset about, but I'd take 40 years of it before I'd ever go back to relive anything that came before.

In other times my nostalgia is euphoric, especially when I look back fondly on people that I'm still close to and experiences I had alone in solitude in nature. I think about then and now and the growth of relationships.

We ran the art club and stage crew for the theater at my high school. I\u2019d fallen in love for the first time. My mom wasn\u2019t yet an alcoholic, and I still spoke to both of my parents. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t be a teenager again even if you paid me, but I really miss the closeness and emotional intensity of those years.

I was, but I was also trying so hard to be someone I wasn't born to be for most of my life and you can see it in my eyes. There's joy, happiness, but it's... empty.

Poison dart frogs are the size of a quarter, and thus no predator of them would ever attempt something our size, and vice versa.  A jaguar or other large predator would not waste time on prey that was so small, and so would not be conditioned to know that bright color means poisonous.  Predators like large cats hunt based on movement, so it doesn\u2019t matter what you\u2019re wearing, if you\u2019re moving, you\u2019re food.

            "Well jaguars aren\u2019t really predators of frogs. They go for bigger game, like deer, gators, capybaras, and often fish. The major predators that the dart frog has to worry about it are birds, fish, and reptiles. \nFish have shit eyesight to begin with so ya, you could fool em I guess, but there\u2019s the obvious size difference that they would have to check. Fish are pretty fucking stupid tho and wouldn\u2019t go after you in the first place. \nBirds are known for their killer sight. They have a much denser retina than a human eye, so they have more cells to capture all the little details, helping with distance vision, which makes sense with, ya know, the flying thing. Birds can\u2019t smell for shit though so no worries on that field. But you\u2019d really have to be a great frog imitator to fool these guys. \nReptiles! So vision for sneks and friends is super variable from species to species. Most snakes are colorblind. Pythons and boas are the most common in the tropical rain forest, and they each have a second vision organ that helps them have infrared-like vision, This may help but I really think the size difference would be apparent. Fun fact: snakes don\u2019t have a sense of taste so if they eat a PDF (poison dart frog), then don\u2019t taste the poison. They just kinda die. \nNow while all those guys can be fooled by that jazzy poison dart frog cosplay, PDFs have a major predator that has become resistant to its toxins so he doesn\u2019t even care about that technicolor dreamcoat!

So the evolutionary preference of not eating bright colours may not have evolved as this is a different behavior driving them to attack us. There has been selective pressure to not eat bright things, but there hasn't been any selective pressure not to defend your territory from bright things. The jaguar doesn't really know that bright critters are poisonous. It just doesn't have a desire to eat them as jaguars that do desire to eat them perish. \n\nI know there has been work done on sharks that show they are more likely to attack swimmers in bright colours.

As in, humans cannot enter without becoming dinner, and people very much like to enter for various reasons. So they started wearing masks on the back of their heads, hoping the tigers would think they were looking at them. Tigers, being ambush predators, prefer to be sneaky bastards, and not attack when their dinner is watching.\n\nIt works, for the most part. So the answer is, don't just use bright colors, but turn it into a face shape, and piss a tiger off.",

I dont necessarily mind living together, she lets me do anything I want, but the privacy would be nice. \n\nThe only issue is the market is absolutely terrible right now. A 2+ BR rental in my area (CT) usually goes for $700-800 a person per month (before utilities), and I just cant stomach paying that much just to live in a different house than my mom. With other bills such as student loans & car insurance, it makes it difficult to budget for an expense like that. Especially considering my student loan payment is close to being a rental payment...\n\nI guess I'm just curious what others my age are doing for their living situations. My friends are looking to move and me moving with them would make it a lot easier, but I just feel like its kind of a stupid move financially. It seems like im moving out moreso because of the stigma than my own well-being. \n\nLet me know your thoughts. Thanks!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**EDIT**: Thank you everyone for all the input and rewards lol. It is super appreciated. This turned out to be a lot more helpful than intended. Hopefully it helped some other people as well. I really just wanted to get an understanding of what people my age are doing in these rough times, and you guys did an amazing job illustrating that. \n\nSeems like ~99% of people find it to be okay given the circumstances. I think my plan is to save up one more year and see where we're at. If the market is good I just may be able to get myself a house!\n\nOnce again, feedback much appreciated. Although I didnt get to respond to a lot of people, i read almost every notification I got, and I hope everything works out for you guys.

The only thing I dislike about it is that if they would want to move out right now, it would be difficult with rent and cost of living through the roof. Otherwise, I am happy and so very relieved that I am able to provide them with a home and a situation in which they can save up money for their futures. They both pay a household bill, buy their own groceries and pay their personal bills (insurance, cell phone) as well as contribute to household cleaning and care. We all respect each others boundaries and independence and genuinely enjoy each others company when we do hang out together.\n\nMy son says no one has ever questioned or made a rude comment about him living at home. My daughter's boyfriend did once say something about her \"lack of responsibilities\" based on the fact that she did still live at home but she quickly shut that down by saying, \"Oh yeah, how irresponsible of me to choose to live in a place where I can save money and with people who take care of each other and pull their own weight!\" (He's had some ass-clown roommates in the past). \n\nHope this point of view gives you some insight into how your Mom likely feels about it, 'cause hers is really the only other opinion that matters on the living situation, yeah?",

You've got nothing to worry about so long as you're:\n\n1) Contributing (which it sounds like you are)\n2) Working toward something\n3) Being respectful to your mom and her space\n\nAlso, if your situation is working for you and your mom and you're both fine with it, then do it as long as you want. There may be social pressures, but those are always there for a great many things in life and you're better off not letting them be the main thing guiding your decisions.\n\nAlso, best luck as you ride out the housing market!

I even owe a shitload of money in payday loans because my credit and income wasn't high enough to get a more reasonable interest loan. On top of all of this being poor is punished by your bank, I've probably had to pay over $700 in the last 4 years in NSF fees and they will only forgive so much. I am constantly experiencing existential pain and the judgement of other people.

            "Moving out at a young age, is basically only an American boomer and genX thing.  Historically, people lived at home until they married in the US, and this is generally true abroad.\n\nMove out when you feel financially and emotionally able to do so, provided your mom is fine with you staying.  Definitely don't overstay your welcome, but don't feel external pressure to move out.\n\nYour rent is honestly unfair though.  Pitch in more, pay what a fair share of the rent/mortgage your mom is paying, or pay for other things like groceries.  You're not a little kid with no income prospects.  Someone is paying for your housing, $250 a month doesn't cover it, so start taking more responsibility, in preparation for eventually moving out.",
            "Honestly my kids are only 4 and 5 RN but they can stay here as long as they wanna. Here in Germany it is kind of normal that kids are \"thrown out\" by their parents at 18 years old. (not like forced in most cases but it is encouraged I guess). I moved at 21 years old in the middle of my 3 years job training where I didn't make that much of money. I moved in with my BF who earned more and paid for everything until I got my proper job. He was 24 when we moved in together and he had been previously also still living with his parents. Who had basically half a house next to theirs for us to renovate and move into  if we wanted. We didn't, but that's a different story haha. But the option was there. So why not if you get along?",

            "Just echoing what everyone else has already said, but this cultural pressure to be out and independent at 18 is about as dated and practical to today\u2019s society as a $7.25 minimum wage. If families get along and work well together, it makes perfect sense to share a family home.",
            "Having known a few people who had abusive parents, I consider myself **extremely lucky** I was able to keep living with my mom until I was financially independent enough to move out. That was at the age of 24 for me, but I had/have a well-paying job. My youngest sibling is still living with her at the age of 27, and it's a fantastic decision that's helping them both remain financially solvent, and is also making sure someone's there to keep an eye on her.\n\nSo, OP, never feel bad about still living at home. It might be a little awkward if you have a boyfriend/girlfriend come over for sexytimes, but being able to live with financial security is a luxury a lot of people don't have, and which a lot of people lose specifically/explicitly because they're forced out of their homes, either due to pressure, or because of abusive family members.",

It's a relatively modern thing, moving away when younger.

Not sure if you are in the US but at this moment rent and housing prices are so high and expensive it only makes sense financially to stay home and save up",
            "700-800 for a two bedroom?! Jesus H Christ, I would kill for that.  You'll be lucky to find a 0 bedroom apartment, what they call a studio, for under a 1000 a month where I'm at",

            "Every top answer I've seen says yes stay at home so I just want to offer a different perspective. There is NOTHING wrong with staying at home, that much is very much true. However you are your own person and it's really up to you to decide how to live your life. If you reckon you've got your own independence and you aren't stifled then its by far and away the most economical thing to do. If you're aged 25 and you're going to other people's houses at the weekend to get away, or if you're spending a lot if time in your own bedroom, then you shoud look for your own space. \n\nYou know better than strangers what is right for you. Don't let age come into it. Think about the next few steps in your life, and think about how happy you currently are. If you're loving life then crack on and enjoy it! If you feel stifled then make a financial plan and boost. Only you know what's right for you. \n\nAll that said... you aren't really independent until you learn to live on your own and take care of yourself. Some people never need to learn independence - multigenerational families in one house, sharing the load, etc. My 80 uear old grandfather never learned independence. He lost his wife - my gran- and really struggled. I think you learn a lot about yourself living alone. You see exactly how you suck and how you thrive. There's no safety net. If you can live alone you can tackle the world with more confidence. And it isn't about what others think of you. Its what you think of yourself. You will carry yourself stronger if you have to be self sufficient. \n\nSo the question is, do you want to learn and grow and be self sufficient? Or would you prefer to do what's comfortable, and be more financially stable? It's all about you and nothing to do with anyone else. You should NOT make a decision because other people think something of you. It's your life. Do what's right for YOU. (That said, I do have a bias towards being self sufficient. My opinion is, however, one of many and not more important than anyone elses)",

I'm from CT too so I know exactly what you mean about the housing market; my husband and I bought our condo 4 months before covid hit and its worth $50k more than we bought it for in this market.\nI would suggest looking into condos if you want to get out of your moms house but can't justify paying rent. Even if you end up in a condo to start, you OWN it. You won't be paying to live somewhere that isn't yours, and condos are generally small so its a good starting point; rent for the few condos that are rented at our complex is double what our mortgage is. Plus, usually old people own condos, like in our complex, so its often quieter than apartments too.\nThere are HOA fees, but if you find somewhere that they're low its not bad. We pay less than 1,000 a month with our mortgage and HOA fees combined.",

That $250 rent you're paying means a) you're saving money and b) that money is going back into your family, rather than to a landlord.\n\nKeep saving, stay frugal, and hopefully you can make some good headway on your loans and eventually be in a better place to make a move.

Personally I don't see anything wrong with yours or my situation, because all we're doing is saving money that would otherwise be quite literally going down the drain. Renting a place doesn't do anything for you. My mom and I are actually planning on buying a house together in the coming years because we're currently renting and she feels like her rent money is just lacing the landlord's pocket instead of, for example, gaining some equity in a house we own.",
            "I would be really disappointed with anybody that is not ok with this.",
            "The stigma is stupid. I'm 25 and I live with my mum. My mum is 60 and she lives with her mum. I also live with my grandma. \n\nIt only became a norm for the \"kids\" to move out before marriage, or ever, about 100 years ago. About the same time as sleeping communally started being weird.",
            "I'm Asian, and I'm sure you are not just based on the fact you are asking this. If your living on your own at 25 where I'm from, that's when people will be surprised.",
            "I don\u2019t understand our obsession with moving out when we clearly aren\u2019t equipped financially yet - America culture has made living at home so terrible but honestly there are more perks than we might see in the moment . I too want to move out but i had to remind myself not to do it just for the sake of doing it - but to only do it when I am fully ready. It\u2019s great that you\u2019re blessed with a home and a mother who welcomes you and supports you. I say do what makes the most sense to you! Best of luck \ud83d\ude4c",

            "Not your fault the world is completely screwed up.. in large part due to our parents own generation",
            "The reason I think many people would ever look down upon those  living with  parents into  adult years is the traits that some in that situation have that are negative and not really just the fact that you live with your parents.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor example some people live with parents because they are incapable of taking care of themselves either financially or emotionally.  Some people are lazy and taking advantage of their parents for free housing and food and having them do things for them like laundry and cooking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut for someone like OP here who is contributing and has a good relationship with his mom, it seems great for both of them.  And OP seems to be capable of living on his own financially but choses to not waste that money.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI say do your thing as long as you both seem happy with it, save extra money that you would otherwise be spending on rent and invest it.  You will be very happy with the money you saved long term and you will have much more memories of time spent with your mom when you get older.",
            "You're good, as long as you're not taking advantage of her. In a mean way of course, obviously you're taking advantage of cheap rent. My parents are actively trying to get me back to move in with them, and I'm 25.",
            "There is no shame in living with your parents to save money, especially in this economy. If you can swallow your ego, your wallet will thank you.",
            "I plan on letting my kids live with my until they can have a huge down payment on a house. As long as they ain\u2019t shitty and disrespectful.",
            "I felt weird living with my parents before I mkved out at 23 but in retrospect, its such a non issue. In some cultures people live with their parents until their late twenties or until they are married. So do whats best for you.",
            "As a parent I would like my kids to stay as long as possible provided they chip in and relation is still healthy at older age. I love my kids.",
            "My brother lived at home until he was like 30 something.  Its totally normal nowadays.",
            "I'm pushing 43 living with my mom. My ex abused my identity and put me in deep debt that I'm dealing with now.\n I do pay as much as I can to live here. Atleast $650 every month plus some of the groceries. \nNone of us can afford to live alone anyway.",
            "With the way shit is economically now he'll yes it's ok. I'm 35 and if I could I'd move back in with my parents and save every cent away I would do it in a heartbeat and retire at 50.",
            "Living with your parents is just another talking point for insecure people to use to attack your worth. Don't believe a word of it\n\nIf you were being a parasite, not working, not studying and not paying rent or maintaining the house there might be cause for alarm, but in your case if ya mumma is happy and you're happy then you're all good man",

Ended up being 5 years before I bought a house on my own and then met my now wife and we have a son . Looking back I was worried about what others thought but reflecting back it was a period of time I will look back with happiness especially after nearly losing my dad. Fuck what anyone else thinks"
