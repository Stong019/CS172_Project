If you look at the winners and nominees, it's so baffling how they so frequently fuck it up. The mentality is just give it to Pixar, Disney Animation, or Dreamworks. The ONLY reason Spirited Away won in 2002 (still the best movie to even win the award) was because Disney backed it and Pixar didn't release anything that year.\n\nTo be fair, a lot of those movies are legitimately great. But then we get some dumb years where Lego Movie doesn't even get nominated, Brave beats Wreck-It Ralph, Happy Feet wins, Wallace and Gromit (admittedly, a good film) beats Howl's Moving Castle, and the criminal underrepresentation of foreign animated films.\n\nAnd I know some might say \"Hey, this is an American award show, so why should they care about foreign films?\" Well, firstly Best Animated historically has featured a lot of foreign films (Ireland, Poland, the UK, and Japan, among others, have been represented over the years), and also America is far from the gold standard of animation in the world. There are so many damn good films from Japan alone that could easily beat the snot out of whatever wins at the Oscars each year. 2016 was a very strong year with both Kubo and the Two Strings and Zootopia nominated among other strong contenders, but come on, Your Name smokes all of them.

Then people started complaining that a (horror of horrors) cartoon couldn\u2019t win Best Picture over the \u201creal movies\u201d. The award ended up going to \u201cSilence of the Lambs\u201d (admittedly another movie from a genre that often gets the shaft in the Oscars), and the Best Animated Feature category was created a few years later to make sure that an animated movie would never, ever get nominated for Best Picture ever again.\n\n(The first movie to win that was Shrek, by the way)",

Which is the case for most categories but is even more egregious for animation considering how concentrated animation talent is in the US. \n\nAlso I would hate that category because it would end up going to a celebrity who gave a solid performance instead of professional voice actors who are no offense much better at portraying their emotions through their voices than actors who normally don\u2019t have just their voice.

Most people take that as sacred and will not push it.  Lastly, and most simply, just say \"I can't for personal reasons.\" Just don't elaborate.  If they push you, just don't back down.

This question was sparked by the recent scandal at Rooster Teeth where two people were fired when their nudes were leaked.

Also I can do whatever I want with my body. Again, if someone exploits my vulnerability against my consent that is a crime on their end and a real shitty thing to do. It speaks more to the awfulness of the person leaking them than of the person who took them.",
            "Same answer as a separate comment. I'm an exhibitionist. \n\nI live in a large liberal city where I have the opportunity to be naked in public (legally) and often am, and I enjoy the ego boost from sending them to someone I like. I joke often that half the city has seen me naked between figure modeling, nude beaches and clubs, and it's probably true.\n\nThat being said, I am very tattooed with very large and distinct images. It's literally impossible to not identify me whether my face is in them or not. I don't work for the government, or with children. I don't date the kind of person who would give a shit if I were \"exposed\" and if anyone in my family saw them they would roll their eyes, maybe giggle and move on. Any of my employers would not particularly care and if they leaked on social media, I would probably just enjoy another ego boost and maybe lose a couple followers from highschool that I keep around because their conservative views are entertainment to me at this point.\n\nI'm not saying that these things wouldn't bother people, but to me all of the standard reasons to be afraid of shit leaking don't phase me in the least. I'd post an artsy nude of myself on my front door if it was legal, fuck it. We all have bodies, they're all naked at some point, I'm not showing anyone anything they haven't seen. I think the only circumstance I would be upset with is someone selling my nudes for profit and not giving me any of the money. That would be shitty.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention unsolicited dick pics. Lord knows why they send them, but  in my experience the best way to deal with them is \"Omg thank you! It's so *cute*! Look at that *little guy*! Awwww, he's so *compact* and adorable! Can I have another pic? He's just the *cutest little thing*...\". Never fails to get rid of them.",
            "Because the cost/ risk analysis works in favour of nudes for me. Especially in a pandemic, but even beforehand, sending nudes is (to me) a lowrisk way of being sexual with people I'm interested in, of teasing them, and sharing pleasure with them.\n\nIf my nudes get leaked, meh. Other folks see how hot I am. It won't affect my career, and if anyone thinks negatively about me because of them, frankly they probably have issues with how I live my life anyways.",

            "The reason some men send unsolicited dick pics is actually pretty simple.  This is the same man who would be absolutely thrilled to receive a random nude from a woman he is interested in, and it would instantly make him much more interested.  They are also people who are incapable of realizing that not everyone thinks about and sees the world the same way that they do, and so he assumes that a woman who is interested in him would be equally as thrilled at a random nude as he would be.  \n\nThese men of course are wrong, and sending a nude is never okay unless the receiver has agreed to it and wants to receive it.  But this is why it happens.  He thinks he's doing her a favor.",

My workplace giving me shit for a harmless activity I do in my private time? I probably don't want to work there then.\n\nAnd I doubt my husband would ever be so silly to try to use the nudes I've sent him against me. I have just as many nudes of him, after all.",
            "To summarize some points\nWhy take nudes in general?\n- Thrill of the a activity (whether that simply be risk, legality, etc) \n- Foreplay\n- Documentation of their body\n\nWhy do guys send dick pics?\n- foreplay however as noted its often more than not unsolicited and inappropriate (considering the majority of those who do are doing this to people they don\u2019t know). Within a relationship it may be useful but rarely am i aware of any women enjoying the phallic shape outside of the intimate moment of sex. \n\nWhy the risk with a partner?\n- Like any relationship, theres just a general trust you build with people. For example you\u2019d be cool with having a sleep over with friends but with a stranger you\u2019d assume you could be murdered in your sleep. People take risks with others built on that trust however to what degree can you trust others is up to you. Its wrong on them to betray that trust but its up to you to consider when they\u2019ve developed the level of trust for certain activities. Some people\u2019s boundaries are that they wouldn\u2019t want to take a date back to there place for the first date, some are completely cool with sleeping with someone on the first date and staying the night. Simply a matter of trust and your boundaries in a relationship.",

It\u2019s totally inappropriate.  But when both people are consenting, I think they just do it because it\u2019s a turn on.",
            "I have only ever taken them for my husband. We have been married over 14 years. He works out of town quite often (military) and we both send photos to each other to keep the spark alive long distance. His first deployment was before video calls were commonplace. So, photos it was! As it turns out, it\u2019s quite a confidence boost taking photos for him when we aren\u2019t able to be together in person. His responses are also a lot of fun. To continue to flirt and play with him through our marriage has helped us to remain close and connected. \n\nIf things ever went south, I don\u2019t expect he\u2019d ever be the kind of man to share these with anyone else. I know you can never know in hypothetical situations, though. \n\nIf the worst did happen and he leaked them in the future, I\u2019d have no shame in sharing the explanation that I took nude photos for my husband who has spent quite a chunk of our relationship overseas on deployments or away from home while training. \n\nIt makes me feel good about myself, our marriage, and our sexual relationship.

If you make sure that your pet has a place to go in your apartment where he can be a bit cooler, and a place where he can be comfortable and warm, then not only can he regulate temperature himself, but you can observe his behavior and ascertain his preferences for future reference. \n\nWill this work with your cat? I don't know but it couldn't hurt and I'd be curious to see the results. Perhaps place a cat bed in the coolest, warmest, and mid range of the apartment and just see what happens.",

            "Item:  Housecats are descended from a desert-dwelling animal, the African Wildcat, which was adapted to dry and hot conditions in and around Egypt and the Middle East.\n\nItem: Many domestic breeds have somewhat or much longer fur than their ancestors, as an adaptation to cooler climes in which humans now prefer to live.\n\nItem: Cats have a significantly higher body temperature than humans, naturally.\n\nItem: Cats, unlike dogs, can sweat (and are adapted to higher temps anyway since the Tmber Wolf was a sub-arctic predator to begin with). However, they only sweat through their paws, so it doesn't help much.  If they leave wet footprints though, that's a clue that they're warm.\n\nItem: Smaller creatures have a much higher surface-to-mass ratio than bigger ones, and have a harder time staying warm (they burn more calories doing it, in the case of warm-blooded animals).  Their body shapes & metabolisms are adapted to this.  If you made a mouse the size of elephant, it would spontaneously combust, cooking in its own skin.  An elephant the size of a mouse would freeze to death at room temperature almost immediately.  Higher-than-ideal temperatures don't affect cats as strongly - they don't overheat as easily - as us because they are smaller and more tolerant to warm conditions by default.  They're less tolerant to cold ones, though, for the same reason.  Chilly conditions that would bother but not hurt you could be dangerous for them if they don't find shelter.\n\nCats like warmth, which is one reason why they're cuddly.  They may also be reacting to our lower body temperatures, trying to warm us with their own body heat because we feel slightly \"cold\" to a cat's sensibilities, like a kitten that needs to be warmed up by its mother.\n\nIt's certainly not impossible to overheat your cat... but it's pretty unlikely to happen except to the fattest, longest-furred cat possible in any conditions that a person would find less than stifling.  If you're miserable and sweating to death, your cat's probably unhappy about it, too.  Otherwise, they're probably OK.",

The ruling was \u201ca creative professional can\u2019t be forced to do custom creative work in favor of gay marriage\u201d. \n\nThe ruling was very specific to the circumstances involved - that the work involved was a form of speech that goes against their views, and that it was about the message, not the type of person.\n\nAnd this would not apply just to gay rights. If an atheist artist was working for commission and told to do a mural celebrating Jesus as lord, the artist can\u2019t be forced to do that under this ruling.",

Totally ok.\n\nA gay person walks into your bakery and wants a wedding cake with two men on it. You can deny service.\n\nA straight person walks into your bakery and wants a dozen muffins. Totally ok.\n\nA straight person walks into your bakery and wants a cake with a penis on it. You can deny service.",
            "I think from what I have heard reported is that this ruling is using the 1st amendment rights of the web designer to make their arguments.

And, here's the kicker, that was always true for religion. You were always allowed to say \"Sorry, I am not making a website advertizing your bible course.\" Nothing has changed there.\n\nEDIT: Look, I, too, find it appalling that this person had to experience discrimination like this. And I appreciate that it must taste like ash that the right to do this is getting affirmed by an institution like SCOTUS, particularly the current one. Of course this is a test case of how far you can go in legalizing discrimination via the \"you can't force me to like the gays\"-argument. However, think about the implication of a precedent that, under certain circumstances, compelled speech is just. Laws don't just work one way and this might be just as dangerous a slippery slope. Some things might be better decided on principle rather than a situational feeling of justice.",
            "Yes religious people can be denied service on the same grounds. \n\nNo it won't open the flood gates.\n\nThe ruling is that people can't be compelled to say things they don't want to under the first ammendment, so it's ok to deny service to people of protected classes if your service involves saying things or creating works of art.",

            "Why are people confidently misinterpreting SCOTUS\u2019 decision here?\n\nThe top comment, and the replies to the top comment, matter-of-factly say that the scope of the ruling is limited because it\u2019s only talking about speech. Here\u2019s why they\u2019re wrong, and why it\u2019s important to make it clear what this ruling means for LGBTQ+ people.\n\nIn Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission (2018), the Court held that the state couldn\u2019t force a man to bake a cake and design messages etc on that cake that support gay marriage. Although this ruling was highly criticized and limited LGBTQ+ protections in public accommodations laws, this ruling *is* based on a question of the freedom of speech clause in the first amendment. In other words, it\u2019s not that you can deny someone a cake because they\u2019re gay - you just can\u2019t force a baker to endorse something they don\u2019t believe in in a form of speech (the message on the cake). \n\nBut 303 Creative LLC v. Elenis (decided yesterday) is different. Although the majority decision uses the same concept of compelled speech to conclude that a website designer can refuse to produce a wedding site for a gay couple, they overstep the idea of compelled speech. They go beyond allowing her to refuse to write any particular message endorsing gay marriages or something like that, and conflate providing the service at all with a form of speech. \n\nAs Sotomayor puts it, it\u2019s one thing to say that you can\u2019t force someone to write messages supporting gay marriage or design images that do the same for the site. That\u2019s already (unfortunately) established to be true (Masterpiece Cake Shop, 2018). It\u2019s another to say \u201cI will not produce websites for gay couples,\u201d since technically, the gay couple should be allowed to pay her to produce the same kind of website she makes straight couples under public accommodations laws like CADA (the law in question). The website designer was requesting the ability to both refuse service to gay couples for her wedding sites *and* put messages on her own website saying she will not make wedding websites for gay couples.\n\nEven if that means the gay couple is buying a site full of religious scripture about marriage being a man and a woman, the state should totally be able to protect gay people from being denied that service on the basis of being gay. In that way, denying them that service is an ACT of discrimination, not a form of protected speech.\n\nThe ruling, however, oversteps. It doesn\u2019t just say \u201cshe can refuse to write or design certain forms of speech that she disagree with,\u201d it says she can refuse to serve gay people at all and put signs on her site saying she won\u2019t serve gay people. Which is bullshit. Because again, making her make a website that she already produces for straight people, and changing nothing, is not compelling her to speak a way she doesn\u2019t want to. \n\nAnother example Sotomayor gives is portraiture. If you take portraits of people, you can\u2019t refuse to take portraits of gay people, in the same way that you can\u2019t refuse to take a portrait of a black person regardless of your \u201cbeliefs\u201d about them. The portrait is not an endorsement of gay marriage, it\u2019s the same service you are already providing to the public. If you take couples photos that say \u201cjust married\u201d at the bottom, and do that for straight couples, having to do the same for a gay couple isn\u2019t making you speak in favor of something you don\u2019t believe in. In cases like this, the state\u2019s interest to protect marginalized classes in public accommodations takes precedence. \n\nAnother example (by me). Wendy\u2019s can\u2019t refuse to serve me and my boyfriend just because they claim that doing so would be endorsing gay marriage, which goes against their believes. The service itself is not speech, and would be the same service provided to anyone else. They can\u2019t put a sign up that says gays can\u2019t eat here. The problem is that this case broadly interprets \u201cserving a gay couple at all\u201d as a form of speech endorsing a belief. \n\nThe majority opinion falls apart when you replace every instance of same sex marriage with interracial marriage. The Bible technically says interracial marriage is wrong. So shouldn\u2019t the website designer be able to refuse to design websites for interracial couples? Of course not, because that\u2019s discriminatory and you\u2019re denying them a service (which is an act of discrimination, not speech).",
            "I'm confused as to why people in this thread seem to think being gay is a choice, or an ideology? There are tons of comments going, \"Well, all the case means is that you can't be compelled to say/do things you don't agree with.\" But, like, being gay isn't some opinion you hold. I don't think any sane person would agree that, for example, if an interracial couple asked for a portrait to be taken, and a photographer goes \"Oh, sorry, we don't do portraits for mixed couples,\" obviously they should not be allowed to do that. Am I missing something here? This is not a difference in ideology or whatever, being gay is something you are inherently, if I'm gay and I want a wedding topper with two men on it, for example, you *shouldn't* be allowed to refuse me service for that specific reason. Deeper in this thread there is a guy going \"Well you couldn't force someone to make me a cake with a swastika on it!\" Completely ignoring Nazism is a belief that you hold, while being gay is something you inherently are. If I want a website made about being gay you *shouldn't* be allowed to refuse because you don't \"agree with being gay.\" This is like someone refusing to make a website about black people because \"they don't agree with being black.\" If you really didn't want to give me service make up some other reason, it isn't that hard to come up with something.",

            "The problem with the answer that this has always been allowed is two-fold. First, the majority opinion did not explicitly define this type of compelled expression of speech as writings. Therefore, it\u2019s unclear as to whether any artistic expressions fit within this classification. One may argue an exquisite Michelin star meal tailored to the customer may fall within the classification of pure expressive speech. Maybe the specific experience a hotel or cruise tailors to its customers qualify as expressive speech. While that is potentially unlikely, it is still uncertain. The second problem is the public accommodation factor. The reason why the majority opinions analogies fails when citing examples of a movie director denying to make a movie that contradicts her seriously held believes is a false equivalence, because directors don\u2019t offer their services to the public at large. On the other hand, this website making service was presumably a public accommodation.",

If a restaurant won't serve people with hats, my non-hat-wearing friends and family will most likely not go there since I'm not welcome there. Multiply this by a dozen hat-wearing people and the restaurant has lost a chunk of revenue.

Archaeologists dig to a certain predetermined depth, using established digging techniques that dictate the procedure of the digging and the categorization of objects found.

It is the result of Homestead Acts such as the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (1971) or the Stock-Raising Homestead Act (1916).[1] A split estate is similar to the Broad Form Deed, a type of legal document created in the United States in the early 1900s. These documents were used to sever property into mineral and surface rights, just like a split estate today.[2]\n\nIn the 49 United States practicing British common law (the 50th, Louisiana, derived its law from French and Napoleonic Code), a split estate is created when the original fee simple owner sells or otherwise loses ownership of the subsurface, often called the mineral estate. Executor rights transfer in whole, unless otherwise reserved, and administration of the estate carries the same rights, liabilities, and privileges the surface estate does.[which?]\n\nIn the Louisiana, severability of estate is legal and common, however a particular law practice similar to easements in English law allows the reversion of the mineral estate to the current surface owner if the mineral estate is not actively engaged in productive activity. This is similar to squatter's rights in other states; however other states do not allow this for the mineral property.",

            "I'm able to induce a state similar to this. It's interesting to me, not scary or distressing, maybe because I have experience with it via meditation. I learned how to do it from Sam Harris while using his Waking Up app. \n\nYou hold your hands so that the fingertips of one hand are touching the fingertips of the other, as in \"Here is the church. Here is the steeple.\" Then you move your fingers in little circles or press them more firmly together, less firmly, more firmly, less firmly... Any repetitive motion. And you focus your attention on it. Once you've established that, ask \"Who is moving the fingers?\" (It might help to use the words \"the fingers\" instead of \"my fingers.\")\n\nWhat I find when I do this is that I don't know who (or what) is moving them. They're just moving. And it gets weirder from there, because I also don't know when or how they'll *stop* moving. \n\nI play with this by deciding to stop moving them, and, sure enough, they stop. But if I pay close attention, I realize there's no sense of causation. I'm aware that I had an intention, and I'm aware that the fingers \"decided to obey\" the intention. But it's exactly as if I'd asked someone else to stop moving *his* fingers and he decided to comply. There's no sense that I control my fingers. \n\nI usually play around for a while, deciding to start and stop the movement a few times, experiencing how my intentions and the starting and stopping are (seemingly) disconnected, and how when my fingers do start and stop, it's (seemingly) just coincidental that they do so close in time to my decision.\n\nTime seems to slow down, and, after making a decision, I start wondering, \"Will the fingers comply?\" It seems like there's a slight lag in time before they do.\n\nThen I take it a step further and ask \"Will a decision to stop moving the fingers happen?\" (Which is a better question than \"Will *I* decided to stop moving my fingers?\") I shift my attention from the volition of finger movements to the volition of decision making, and I find that whether-or-not a decision happens (or who or what makes it) is just as mysterious as whether or not that decision is obeyed. \n\n*Maybe* a decision will happen. And then *maybe* the fingers will comply with the decision.\n\nThe finger exercise is really just a way to examine volition, and you could do it with any sort of movement or thought. \"Will this body sit down on the sofa?\" \"Will there be a decision to go to order pizza?\" But I find using fingers to be an easy way to get into the right mindset. \n\nAs I said, none of this is distressing to me. I am very comfortable with relinquishing (what I believe to be the illusion of) free will, but I've heard this sort of thing can be distressing to some people. If you're prone to dissociation or generally worry about lack of control, you may want to steer clear of it. \n\nAnd, minds being different from each other, you might try it and think, \"What the hell is that guy talking about? Clearly, I made my fingers stop moving.\" I've played around with this sort of thing for years*, and I can't tell whether what I experience is what most people would experience instantly or whether it requires practice. Or whether some minds can do it and others can't.  \n\n---\n\n* I think it started when I was a kid. I'd wake up in the morning and wonder, \"Am I going to get out of bed?\" or \"I wonder when I'm going to get out of bed?\" and it seemed as if getting-out-of-bed was just something that happened or it didn't--that it wasn't my decision. I think this can be easier to play with when you're a little groggy. It's when your (or at least my) sense of volition is weakest. At some point, it occurred to me to move the focus to \"Am I going to *decide* to get out of bed?\" Years later, I learned the helpful language shift to \"Will getting-out-of-bed happen?\" and \"Will a decision to get out of bed happen?\"",

            "When you know how it works it's even freakier, honestly. In fractions of a fraction of a second, you decide what you want to do, send electrical signals down a nerve by dumping certain chemicals into it, those signals propagate down to the muscles you need to move, and then a whole ton of muscles all coordinate to contract just the right amount. That happens because the electrical signal reaches them and dumps different chemicals that activate your muscles. Muscles work by a rotating chemical reaction whereby a certain chemical binds to a protein, the protein splits it for energy and then moves the head of the protein a tiny bit and binds to a different protein on a sheet next to it. Then the head moves back and it repeats over and over across a zillion of these threads so your muscles kind of crawl their way together as the threads pull themselves closer.\n\nAnd all of this happens across multiple muscles in perfect concert to move your thumbs to just the right spot to touch on a piece of glass to type out this message on a little black rectangle connected the the entire collection of human knowledge through the oscillating of invisible energy.",

Even the high quality footage, including our few 4k cameras, was nearly useless for identifying anyone  or anything.  \n\nParking lot cams are often too far away to even get a good make and model, much less the 16 pixels that makes up a license plate.  \n\nFor cams in a building, if you aren\u2019t a recognizable person, meaning the people looking at the cams know you, we likely won\u2019t be able to tell either.  \n\nI recall one incident where we had only sixteen usable seconds of a suspect\u2019s face.  That was actually a ton of footage of a suspect.  Only a few frames came out with a decent picture.  Each one looked almost like a different person.  We never figured it out.  \n\nCameras are useful when we know who you are to begin with.  This is why entry cards are so useful.  We compare card reader scans to when the bad guy came in the door, and that can lead you to your suspect.  You can just walk in behind someone.  \n\nFacial recognition is making cameras useful.  I\u2019m completely against facial recognition.  \n\nCameras are so easily defeated and so often useless that a criminal can pretty much ignore them. \n\nI want you to think on this.  I worked at a small university for 13 years.  We had over one hundred cameras.  Six cameras cycled on the screen every three seconds.  Each camera panned and zoomed on a regular interval depending on their programming.  Imagine the luck you would need to be looking at the right cam in the right position at the right time in the right light, etc.  Could you catch a crime in the act like that?  No.  In my time there, a crime was never caught in the act while passively using the security cameras.\n\nIf a crime is reported, and I know exactly where to look, on the right camera, if it is in the right place, in the right lighting conditions, if it is clean, and is actually working, I might be able to gain useful information.  I can only think of a handful of times it ever worked out that way through active use.  Even then, seconds can go by and your suspect is on a whole different camera.\n\nThere are some things that cameras are good for:  Post incident investigation (good luck making an ID), seeing who is at the door when they ring the bell because they lost their badge, making sure that super expensive and/or dangerous piece of equipment is still there, etc.  \n\nBut what they are really good for is a deterrent.  A $10 fake camera will prevent as much crime as a real one.  The fake one just won\u2019t get you those recordings for investigation.  \n\nI should go make some fake cameras.",
            "TLDR: the point is the high cost of preserving the data",
            "I see a few people saying file size is a big issue, but I don't think that plays a part at all.\n\nStorage size is irrelevant now days, maybe 5 years ago this would be a huge hurdle for high quality video, but 168 hours (one week of constant footage) of 1080p video at a nominal 23 FPS would only be around 850 gigabytes at a high quality codec like MPEG2 HIGH, and you can find even 1 terabyte SSD's for under 50 dollars today. Downgrade that to something like 720 and you're looking at something around 370 gigabytes. \n\nThe real reason I would assume is that most businesses and chains (like gas stations or restaurants or retail outlets) don't really care if the person gets caught or not, they are looking to fulfill their insurance requirements and if they do that they will be reimbursed for the damages and stolen property anyway. The main goal of putting a security system in place is to deter criminals, not catch them. Even with an HD camera there's always the possibility of the criminal not being identified, and that possibility grows when you consider most criminals are not going blindly into the building with no mask or disguise.\n\nThere would be no real security benefit to most businesses having HD cameras installed.",

I can save 10 days of video day and night with 8 cameras.",

            "The short answer: it isn't. When a camera can't make out license plates, faces, or any identifying features, the value of the security camera is purely its use as a deterrent for crime. \"People won't steal if they think they're on camera.\"--Which has been proven false time and time again.  \n\n\nThe real answer is most business owners don't know the value of having a properly managed security system. The main reason for this is most security companies require a monthly subscription to maintain and monitor their cameras at your business. I think this article about the hidden costs of not upgrading your cameras could be helpful expanding on this topic:   [https://csn.im/upgrade-cams](https://csn.im/upgrade-cams) \n\nAdditionally, many security camera owners are not aware that there are cost-effective ways of upgrading their old, analog cameras.

This will greatly improve our video capabilities for this one building (out of five). If I'm lucky, I'll get seven years out of this equipment before it's falling to crap again. Contrast that with the 17 years the analog stuff lasted.\n\nI work for a city government. I have to spend my resident taxpayer's dollars as efficiently and productively as I can. $80k could replace nearly my entire network infrastructure. It could replace my entire server farm. It could put quality WiFi in every corner of my buildings. It could get me another staff member or like two months of valuable consulting time for major projects. It could buy a nice new desktop or laptop for 70% of our employees.\n\nAnd what's the reward for upgrading security cameras? So that once per year when I have to pull footage of which person hit someone's car in the parking lot, I can get a slightly less blurry picture of their car? Granted, I am not a bank getting robbed, but it gets challenging to justify those costs sometimes. Then again, since I'm not a bank, I'm also not fending off quite the same level of international cyber attacks on a second to second basis. So...you know...we're all picking battles here.\n\nAnyway, the short version is that they could upgrade the cameras, but other equipment or projects may be a better use of the money in that particular year.",

Each drive is currently $138 on Amazon, so we're at a total of $1,002 for our storage, which in a RAID5 gets us 18TB of storage, or about 1.8 months of straight storage from 10 HD cameras recording around the clock.

            "storage storage storage.  \n\nThink of it this way - How many movie files would amount to 24hrs of viewing pleasure? Say 12-18. How much space would that take up? \n\nFor a non-HD movie, it's about 1 to 1.5gb each, so that's a total of around, lets say, 14gb.  \nThat's one days footage. On one camera. A small-ish system would be 5 cameras.   (Front, Back, Till, Inside 1, Inside 2)\nThat's 70gb recorded per day - and that's best-case.\n\nSo CCTV systems tend to have different encoding (like h.261) to make the filesize smaller, settings to only record movement can help aswell as users reducing quality on individual cameras on low-risk areas etc.  \n\nHD systems do exist and are in use in many place, but they are pretty expensive - The price is coming down as storage technology progresses. So a smaller company might get a lower cost system for economic viability.  \nI get that they should 'invest in their security' and I agree, but the difference between a 'normal' system and HD is literally thousands - Not only does the box cost a lot more, but the cameras do aswell. So there would be a cost/risk analysis aswell.  \nSome licences and stuff also require a minimum amount of footage retained\n\nAs for how useful - The horrible answer is 'it depends'. The footage isn't only to show WHO the person is, but also WHAT they did. Chances are, they'd already be known by the police or in custody by the time the footage gets requested.",
            "I worked in security for more than a decade and have worked with multiple security systems and storage systems at mills, banks, food production facilities, box stores, ports and even portable systems so can answer this with a fair level of experience.  \n\nThe simple answer is money.  What happens is when you are upgrading a system or putting a new one in place the on site security supervisor will be told to shop around for a company that can do it, figure out what hardware you need, and get a quote.  You will then send that quote to corporate to someone who knows nothing more about cameras than that there Iphone has one and they saw a gooproo once that was only $25 and they know those are supposed to be the best thing ever so why is your system going to cost $5k?  Get that price down to $2k or you get nothing.\n\nSecond the vast majority of security is set up to the absolute minimum because the only reason many companies even have security is because its mandated by law or insurance.  The company doesn't really want security so wont spend one cent more than they absolutely have to.\n\nBoth of these things combined also mean that even if your cameras were installed in 1990 as long as they still turn on and record it means insurance is happy which means corporate will just ask why you are trying to replace working cameras and deny the upgrade.  \n\nA lot of this boils down to if something happens to you, it sucks for you, the company has insurance and doesnt really give a damn.  If something happens to the company they have lawyers and insurance to handle it already.",

There's a reason you still see TV crews carrying around huge cameras rather than say an iPhone- big lenses mean good image quality. Security cameras tend to use tiny lenses that cause a lot of blurriness and distortion because they're small and cheap and not good at gathering light.

Set everything to only record on motion detection and you'll claw back a significant portion of that. So you're back up to maybe 2-3 weeks. More cameras or higher quality encoding knocks it down again.\n  \nThe reality is that most camera systems were purchased for ~$500 3 to 5 years ago as a turnkey solution from Costco. They were set up at time of purchase, by the owner, with little eye towards actual security (bad position, bad lighting, bad angle, dirty lenses, you name it), and everything was left at the default, or tweaked once during setup and left. In a lot of cases, they set up a screen to show a live uncompressed feed from the cameras. They assume that the recorded video will look just as good as the live feed (which it won't). They also frequently assume that the presence of the live feed is evidence that the system is still running properly and the hard drive hasn't failed (totally not the case).

Sure, you *think* you know what kind of camera that is, and you *think* that the camera won\u2019t be able to pick up more than a few smudges as you move around... but you can\u2019t be certain.\n\nIt\u2019s smarter to rob the place down the street, the one that doesn\u2019t have cameras at all.\n\nIf the cameras are manned, then the security guard manning them doesn\u2019t need a good picture quality. They just need to know that someone is in the stockroom after-hours, and all employees are clocked out. If they get a face, great. If they just see a dude... that\u2019s the cops\u2019 problem when they arrive.",
            "Look at what insurance requires.\n\nGetting anything above that is a waste of money as it doesn't make a difference to the business if the guy gets caught or not as long as they get the insurance payout.\n\nSo 480/720p@10fps or less,  maybe in black and white it is.",
            "Simply: cost! For those who do this commercially, when figuring out which camera goes where because the original contractor from a decade ago never changed it then the cost goes up. \n\nI won't quote the company I did this for but to upgrade a a single store for a nationwide company is around $30,000 if it all goes to plan. Otherwise it's $42,000 because shit never goes to plan. As this is nationwide, costs go up once you multiply location numbers and ass in costs for maintenance issues because crap quality cameras somehow survived longer. \n\nAt that cost easier for a company to ignore it or have insurance cover if it becomes a big eff up.",
            "In one word, Money.\n\nMy company is still using the security camera system they put in place 17 years ago. We have several cameras that no longer function and a couple others that cut in and out, but no one wants to devote the sort of money necessary to replace the system. While one camera that does pretty good may be pretty cheap we have a large facility. The big expenses are installation of all the literally miles and miles of wiring, and the software licenses, installation, and set up. We are finally slated to get a new system and the price tag is greater than the price of an entire truck load of the cameras.",

            "Also you underestimate what cheap to a regular consumer vs. cheap to a corporation is.     The mall I work at is incredibly cheap like you wouldn't believe.",
            "I'll give you a bit of anecdotal information.  At my place of employment, we have some hundreds of cameras recording to ~5 fairly beefy servers with a pool of local SATA drives giving ~10TB storage each.  They also have motion capture areas that will stop recording when there is no motion.  They will then archive off video more than maybe 7-10 days old.  I believe we do have it downscale/compress that video (which is a computationally expensive operation) and keep that for some extended period of time.  The longer and higher quality you keep footage, the more storage you need.\n\nFor basically every new area we build/add cameras to, they're buying the newer fancier pantsier high deffier cameras.  Also when cameras break they are doing the same.  I think they've gone and replaced old cameras in areas where having higher res data is of high value.  Most of the cameras they just don't bother with unless there's a specific need to.  Besides the cost of the camera, which isn't much in the grand scheme of things, you also have to factor in the manpower required to swap out the camera.  May not be too bad on an individual camera basis, but each adds up, and if you're talking hundreds, that adds up.  Then you also need to factor in that replacing older low-res cameras with high-res reduces the camera density of each recording server, so you probably have to buy new (and probably even beefier) servers to be able to take in the additional load.  Those servers can easily be in the tens of thousands of dollars each.  You then have to potentially purchase any additional software licenses and the manpower to set those up.\n\nJust some thoughts.  I will say that we don't really have any 'ultra-low quailty' cameras except maybe at that one red-headed stepchild of an offsite location that no one apparently really cares about.  Even then it's not that bad from what I remember.",
            "You have to also think about most are cloud-based streaming devices and not on premise. If it was all on premise the file would be absolutely enormous and because they're cloud-based it is very hard to stream good quality",
            "Business security cameras aren\u2019t cheap.  Figure a grand or two per camera, plus 10k or more for the dvr, plus tens of thousands for cable runs, PoE injectors, etc.  And the tech will be obsolete in a few years.  It doesn\u2019t make sense for a business to upgrade all that often.\n\nAlso, you have to keep in mind that the size of the area covered by a camera affects picture quality too.  If you are covering an entire warehouse floor with one 4K camera, it\u2019s gonna look great zoomed out, but chunky zoomed in.  There\u2019s a good chance the low quality images you see on the news these days are all high def and digital, but they\u2019re covering too large of an area.\n\nAnother concern is lighting.  Infrared doesn\u2019t help unless you\u2019re right on top of the camera.  If it\u2019s too dark, it will be grainy.\n\nTo the guy who said storage is a concern: nah, not at all.  You don\u2019t record security footage at 30-60 FPS, you do it at maybe 5.  And they\u2019re compressed (typically lossless), so yeah.  Space ain\u2019t a big worry.  It\u2019s cost and bad layout.\n\nSource: worked for a security company for years.",

They prob at the onset wanted to make it a T rating, but didn\u2019t want to drastically redesign it when given the M rating, so just conceded. \n\nSo prob just a choice by the developers at the onset to try and have their market extend to teenagers and younger kids by leaving out f-bombs and other language that would push a T rating to an M rating. \n\nI agree though the level of violence in the other Arkham games in my mind should be the thing to push the ratings to more mature audiences, but we\u2019re obsessed with F-bombs and boobs. Another example is Elder Scrolls 4 the base game was T and the game of the year was M.

In an early version of a game they were making, they had inserted the dialogue bank that he had written, in which there were 2-3 examples of a character saying a variant of the word fuck of out of a total of dozens and dozens of dialogue options. Well in a certain scene, the room swarms with a lot of npcs in a big drawn out battle. Since they sporadically would spout off a random line of dialogue, it just so happened that the word fuck was uttered several dozen times in the span of about 5 minutes. \n\nI\u2019m sure there are technical ways around this, like reducing the frequency of certain dialogue entries, but I guess the programmers had too much on there plate for something that could more easily (and cheaply) just be re-written. \n\nStill, it makes me laugh thinking about a buggy game where a room full of npcs all start swearing like sailors during the middle of a big firefight.

        "selftext": "My girlfriend and I went kayaking today (Upper Peninsula of Michigan) and we stopped along the shore multiple times to find rocks. On one of these stops, we noticed that behind a row of trees there seemed to be a field. I wanted to check it out so we did. It turned out to be a pond just behind the trees, their shores maybe 10 feet apart but it smelled really gross. \n\nWe started back to our kayaks when I said that it smelled of something dead and rotting. (When I was younger, I\u2019d seen a dead possum floating in water at a golf course, and it smelled just like that).\n\nMy girlfriend gave me a weird look and went back to check the smell again and I followed. It again reminded me of that smell only it was much stronger than the possum had been when I was younger and despite us looking, there was no animal near us to be found. \n\nWe turned back to our kayaks and saw what looked like something was dragged in the sand through the spot we\u2019d stood at to look at this smelly pond. We thought it was odd but figured maybe it was a beer cooler. We\u2019d seen some beer cans on the small lakeshore. \n\nWe got back in our kayaks and started to paddle away. We kept close to the shore and discussed what could be making that smell and the drag marks when we heard something in the woods off to our right. It sounded like something was walking through the woods, what I assumed to be either a person or a large dog. I\u2019ve never head a bear before but I suppose it could\u2019ve been that as there are bears in the UP. \n\nI started towards the noise with my kayak &  told my girlfriend to not follow me toward the shore. The sound stopped as I got closer. After a few minutes of silence, I started paddling back to my girlfriend. \n\nShe told me she thought she heard someone say \u201cstop, they\u2019re right there\u201d coming from the woods. We discussed this for several minutes while kayaking back towards our cabin. My girlfriend then also brought up that she heard voices when we were originally looking at the pond. I told her I too had heard them then but I assumed them to be far away, possibly even across the lake and just traveling over the water. My girlfriend thinks she heard it near the pond, more towards the woods than lake. \n\nSo what we have in all is:\n-we saw drag marks with no footprints\n-had a smell of something rotting\n-heard something/someone walking in the woods \n-may or may not have heard someone talking nearby\n\nShould we do something?\n\n\n**Edit for update:** We went to the county Sheriff\u2019s Department and told them what we saw/what happened. They said they would send their ORV to check it out. They took our names and number and said they\u2019d contact us if they have any questions. \n\nTo answer some comment questions/replies: We honestly don\u2019t care if they do or don\u2019t do anything about it, we just felt we should maybe report it but weren\u2019t sure. One Redditor said if you\u2019re asking if you should, then do and from now on I\u2019ll follow that. \n\nWe are aware they could all be separate things, and it doesn\u2019t make sense they would be there if the crime happened long enough for it to stink. But regardless, if it\u2019s a hunted animal being dropped, it isn\u2019t hunting season and that\u2019s illegal too. There\u2019s a lot of endangered animals here so I think it\u2019s worth it to report it anyway. \n\nTo the people who think I am making this up, I got all A\u2019s in English throughout college and even received an award for one of my narrative papers. If this was fake it would\u2019ve been better written and you wound my writing skills sir/ma\u2019am. \n\nEither way, we will not be returning to that area.",

On the way down to the river we had to cut through a small forest (maybe 50m / 75ft) between the park and the river. As we're walking through, we came upon a very distinct and unusual clearing. Amongst the usual underbrush, there was a small rectangular patch of grass about 1m by 2m (3'x6').\n\nAt the time I remember thinking, \"that's weird that someone would plant a perfectly rectangular patch of grass randomly in these woods down by the river!\" And then I thought no more of it.\n\nYears later - a decade or more - somehow that memory came back to me and it clicked in my head that it might not have been a randomly planted patch of grass after all. I may have unwittingly stumbled upon an unmarked grave down by the river that day.",

I can imagine a lone weirdo killer returning, but if a group or at least 2 people are going to dump a body it would probably be reasonably fresh and wouldn\u2019t smell that strongly. \n\nAlso stagnant water can really stink on its own. \n\nI recon you\u2019ve stumbled upon a stinky pond and some people doing something a little dodgy.

            "To echo the majority of the comments here, to be on the safe side, you should report it, OP. \n\nIt's more likely that what you were smelling could have been an **animal corpse**, given the area you were in. As to the voices, if it was indeed an animal corpse, it could have been other people checking out the smell as well, like you and your girlfriend were doing, but just didn't want to be spotted by you guys. If you saw drag marks with no foot prints nearby, it could have been from another kayak/boat, and whomever was dragging it was walking *infront* of the boat, which could wipe away footprints as a result. Think back, did you happen to see another boat in the area?\n\nHowever, just because it's unlikely that it was a human corpse, doesn't mean it isn't **possible**. Some commentors are saying that most killers don't wait for the corpse to start rotting before disposing of it, which is usually the case, but there have been sinister situations were killers *have* held onto bodies while they smelled, like [this serial killer in Cleveland, Ohio](https://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/11/04/ohio.cleveland.bodies/index.html). Plus, as a Michigander myself, I wouldn't be surprised if someone did try to hide a body in that area. I read a long time ago about a killer who waited a little while to hide a body and only did something about it because the smell got worse, but I can't find the article/information on it.

I think you've come across two unsettling but also unrelated situations, and it's easier to hype yourself up when you're spooked, especially with others. I'm not a detective but it stands out to me that there were no footprints, why would a killer go to the lengths of covering up their footprints but not the drag marks? That's what makes me think this is a dead animal, obviously hunted by something. \n\nThe whispering is weird, but when you actually take what they said out of the context you've put it in, it's non threatening. For all you know there was a campsite near by and a couple teenagers snuck off to smoke some weed. I read a lot of true crime and I can't really think of a case where a couple of killers gave themselves away like that. If you had returned to a crime scene, or were attempting to leave one at least, and someone was around and you really didn't want them to know you're there, you'd be quiet. Ted Bundy actually did this to a couple right after or before he had killed someone/disposed of their body, I can't remember the exact details but he was hiding in the woods nearby and someone was very close. They had no idea. Killers like that either work alone or when they're with someone, they're quiet.",

            "If it concerns safety, always report it. Authorities can take it from there.\n\nLong story time, tl;dr at the end.\n\nI was going camping with a buddy of mine in Cleveland National Forest (in California) a few years back. We were on a one lane dirt road, about 30 minutes past where cell signal dropped. It was roughly mid day (I don't exactly remember what time). We saw a black SUV parked at what could be a scenic lookout point, but there was no one near the car.\n\nAbout 500 feet further down the road, we came across a woman dressed like she was going to the mall. I think she was wearing flats (I'm not a shoe person), a dress, and carrying a black purse. She looked dehydrated and like she had been walking for days.\n\nWe stopped and I asked her what she was doing out there and if she needed water. She quickly accepted the offer for water, and said it was her SUV up the road. She said some friends were coming to meet her and she was just going for a little walk. We were concerned and she looked exhausted so I offered her a ride in the back of my car (didn't want it to be weird or have her feel uncomfortable riding in the passenger seat with a random guy).\n\nWe stayed with her for a couple minutes and gave her some more water. She didn't get in the SUV or get out any keys, which I found a little odd. My friend (also a guy) and I didn't want to make her uncomfortable by hanging around so we asked a couple more times if she felt ok by herself and she kept saying she'd be fine. Not in an annoyed way, but almost in a maybe not quite 100% mental capacity way - I'd say about 90%. I attributed her demeanor to her exhausted look, so we let her be and went on our way. She seemed like she didn't want us hanging around and again, we didn't want to impose. In my rear view mirror she stayed by the SUV until I couldn't see it any more.\n\nWe continued to our destination, hiked a bit, and camped for the night. In the morning a park ranger came to check on the campsite and we chatted with him a bit. We asked if there was a black SUV parked up the road and he said yes. My friend and I shared a worried look and asked if he saw a lady anywhere near it. He said no but he found a black purse further up the road towards the exit of the dirt road. We told him about the lady and all came to the somber conclusion that we'd have to report her missing.\n\nWe packed up quickly and left the camp. The black SUV was still there on the way out. We didn't think at the time to get the plates, we figured it was the only vehicle for about 10 miles down this road, they'll find it for sure. As soon as we had signal we pulled over and I called the county sheriff. I wasn't sure how to describe the story so at first they said they'll report the abandoned vehicle. I reiterated that it seemed like the woman was gone and instantly the operator's tone became more serious. She said she'd transfer me directly to an officer to report a missing person. The officer asked me a bunch of questions and I answered them as best I could. I gave my contact info and they said they'd call if they had any more questions. \n\nThe next day a detective (I'm guessing at all the law enforcement titles, I have LE friends but I'm not in LE) called me and asked me to repeat the story in as great of detail as I could remember. He said that the owner of the SUV could not be contacted and no one was at the registered address. I can't remember if he gave me a name to see if I was familiar with it but I definitely had no idea who the woman was. He asked a few clarifying questions and again I answered as best I could remember. \n\nI never heard anything else about it, no stories in the news about a missing woman found dead or alive, no search parties for a missing woman, and I never got another call from the sheriff's department. It's always made me feel a little eerie that I may have been the last person to talk to her alive. I hope that isn't the case and they found her, but I'm not sure how I'd ever find out.\n\nTl;dr - found an abandoned SUV and a woman in the middle of a national park on the way to a campground, couldn't tell if the SUV was hers or not. Park ranger in the morning mentioned he found a purse of the same color the woman had. Called the sheriff's department to report a missing person. Never figured out what happened to the woman.",
