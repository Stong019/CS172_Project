            "The algorithm is just recycling videos for me",
            "It's the same for music. A few years back I would have tons of musics I had never heard in the recommended section. Now it just loops back and never goes out of its confort zone. I'm guessing YouTube would rather make you listen 15 times to the same music then taking the risk that you don't like the new music it suggested.",
            "This is a year or so now since they [changed the recommendation algorithm](https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/09/27/132829/youtube-algorithm-gets-more-addictive/) to avoid pizzagate and all that kind of thing.  It's not good, but they don't want to go back to recommending Qanon so they're kind of stuck at the moment.",
            "You aren\u2019t alone on this, I'm perpetually stuck in an endless loop of the same topic. I rarely pick up small to medium-sized channels in recommendations anymore either. Oh, and the damn app asking if I want premium every time I blink!",
            "Definitely not just you. My YouTube pretty much plays like 1 of 3 songs after a song ends. It's so sad, I used to love going down a youtube rabbit hole and finding new artists. No more :( money ruins everything.",
            "Isn't there anyway you could mess with that \"explorativity\" of the algorythm? there are sometimes when I just want to explore new music but will get to a point of getting music i've been listening for 3 years or so",
            "I absolutely loathe how about 6 months ago or so, youtube started recommending me videos i've already watched. Not one or 2 but like 20% of my recommended feed is stuff I watched. Sometimes YouTube will take away the red watched bar at the bottom of a thumbnail if its been awhile since I watched it, and I'll click on the video before remembering I've already seen it and wasting a few minutes.\n\nI don't know how many countless times I've manually removed recommendations and flagged them as 'already watched', just trying to trach the algorithm this isn't what I want. What makes the people running the algorithms think this is what people want? Is the average person really daft enough to forget, and then want to rewatch a video they saw a month or 2 ago? Why does youtube keep trying to sneak in videos i've watched without telling me I've watched them? I know it's being done on purpose bc YouTube a year ago would never recommend a video I've seen.\n\nIt's infuriating. The algorithm is better than nothing, but why is it so much strictly worse than the algorithms 6-12 months ago.",
            "I agree. But I want to also point out how there\u2019s more ads in videos as well. But the ads are pandering to literal conversations and searches of be done. It\u2019s getting to the point where I\u2019m convinced they\u2019re trying to barrage you with bullshit until you cave and buy their overly priced ad-free service. $12.99 for no-ads and download offline. If you have an iPhone you can screen record the shit. And the ads wouldn\u2019t be so bad if they weren\u2019t putting 5 ads (ranging from 5-15 seconds) on a damn 3 minute video!",
            "Been like this for maybe a year now for me.\n\nI've been on youtube since it first started. I've seen *alot* of content from many creators and crews. I had to narrow my subscriptions from 2000 to about 100 or less.\n\nThere wasn't any change. I see the same videos all the time, it shows I've seen it, so why is it reccomending it again?\n\nOkay, press the obscure and tiny \"don't reccomend\" button. Oh, you want to do that for more than one video? Lemme make that fun by hiding this option behind a cryptic button menu. \n\nWant to do that for all the videos on your homepage? Where a majority are clickbait crap, something I've already seen before, or something reccomended that I wasn't interested in and was hoping would go away on it's own but it's been months, clicking don't reccomend and still getting it again, etc.\n\nTheir reccomendations have turned to complete shit. I've never struggled so hard to find a new legitimate creator or newish video in my youtube life.",

            "Apparently the AI was really damn good at recommending videos to users, so good that people thought YouTube was spying on them, so they made the algorithm worse at finding videos for you to watch. \n\nKind of like how apple changed the shuffle feature on iTunes awhile ago because it didn\u2019t feel random, even though it was completely random people felt like it was choosing the same artist or type of song all the time.",
            "Mine is the opposite, I keep getting recommended the garbage you\u2019d see on trending. Mostly makeup videos which as a straight guy I couldn\u2019t give less of a fuck about, I don\u2019t know how they see what I watch and think \u201cOh yeah this dude is gonna love a makeup review\u201d.",

            "YouTube doesn't care about your experience. They care about keeping you on their website for as long as possible. They'd much rather take the safe route and show you stuff they KNOW you'd watch rather than showing you something that MIGHT broaden your horizons. Because if they get it wrong you might flip off the site.",

            "I have been thinking this recently.     Keep getting the same stuff over and over.    And now basically impossible to find new videos by chance.      Even when searching for a subject most of the times it brings up the same 4 or 5 channels that use the keywords to keep themselves in the top searches.     So it's basically impossible to naturally come across new smaller channels.  Really looking for a youtube alternative as it's starting to feel like I'm stuck in a loop.      Also anyone else notice on desktop homepage if you clear you cookies or sign in under a new name you get like say 20 videos per page in small thumbnails , all different topics.  But after a few cycles round watching videos (can take a few days) the amount of videos per page gets smaller and smaller?     Mine at the moment shows me like 9 larger thumbnails now per page.     So scrolling takes longer to find new videos and all are the same like 3 topics I have previously watched.",

            "Well, firstly, exercise addiction is a thing. Secondly, there is a lot more to exercise and addiction than simply dopamine. Addiction happens over a long period of time and has many different factors, genealogy, psychological issues, physiological effects of long-term addiction, tolerance levels, etc. My assumption is you likely don\u2019t exercise often and when you do you stop for a long time afterwards. My suggestion is keep exercising constantly, because the dopamine from exercise doesn\u2019t immediately come after a single rep. Not to mention that the body\u2019s attempts to save energy won\u2019t let the excess energy that people report come immediately. You just have to keep trying. Plus, it\u2019s way easier to smoke crack or eat a hamburger than doing long, strenuous workouts.",

The thing is, the experience of exercise itself is usually pretty unpleasant, especially at first before your body has learned to anticipate the after feeling, which makes it much harder for the dopamine and endorphins to forge a habit. At the beginning when you're forging the habit you gotta go really, really hard and for like at least like 45 minutes. With practice you'll come to notice the exact moment the endorphins hit. It's just....goddamn you feel so good after and without any of the guilt that comes with chemical good feelings.",

Lifting weights/doing crunches and going for a random \"jog around the block\" I would rather shit in my hands and clap. I hate it.\n\nGet your dopamine for an exercise that you like doing.

            "Just exercising to exercise is awful.  I HATE IT.  However if you have an actual, cool goal, it is addicting as hell.  For me that was training for 6 months to run an ultramarsthon which I did.  I definitely got addicted to running for that.  I wanted to see if I could push my limits and then further than that so it was very, very exciting.  So my take is if you're just exercising just because people say you should exercise, fuck that, that sucks.  You have to find a real reason that is meaningful for you for it to be enjoyable and fun",

You could do rock climbing, YouTube fitness classes, trail running, a manual labor job, crossfit, calisthenics at a park, heck, even playing Pokemon Go on a walk! Anything that gets you up and moving counts.\n\nTry finding a physical activity that you really enjoy and try to do it a few times a week and really push yourself while you do it. You might be surprised how addicting it is!\n\nAlso, you have to commit to doing it consistently for two weeks. It takes your body two weeks to adjust to new, physical stimuli.\n\nI've found working out to be really addicting. I've been working out consistently for the past five years because I got into the habit a long time ago, and now if I go too many days without it I feel like I'm going through withdrawals! So I really believe that you just haven't found the form of exercise that you truly enjoy.",

            "I am speaking from my personal experience. \n\nIt took me a year (or more) to get addicted to exercise. I hated it at first. Going to the gym was torture. I got a trainer to help me out, and I highly recommend one if you\u2019re starting out. I eventually had to quit the trainer as it was too expensive but I learned a lot from him. \n\nWhat got me addicted to gym? It\u2019s the feeling of being fit and looking good, not the gym itself. The gym is a means to an end. I guess that\u2019s why it took a year for me to be addicted to gyming. I think it only gets really fun when you start to see your results and you wonder, how much hotter can I be? Yes, there\u2019s narcissism involved. But I find myself focusing on my form way more when I\u2019m in front of the mirror and I see myself. Like, holy hell wow she\u2019s got nice legs and a super small waist. Told you it was narcissistic, but it gets you results. \n\nYou also have the drive to maintain your figure. You also feel the difference if you miss gym days or eat badly. You feel sluggish and heavier. Being fit feels amazing.\n\nThis line from Bojack really resonates with me. It\u2019s when the main character is struggling to get fit and his neighbor, who passes by him everyday when he jogs, offers a little bit of advice: \u201cEvery day it gets a little easier...

I hate running or swimming or tennis, you name it, but I love yoga, going out for a walk or a cycle, hiking in the mountains, pilates. And don't do exercise that is too hard for you. You have to find the sweet spot between being able to last for hours and feeling a  bit challenged. Also, your mind and body simply need time to adjust to this new habit.

            "Hey, \"beef\" and \"pork\" (and veal, and mutton) got their names from the Norman Conquest of Britain in 1066!\n\n> When animals were in the stable or on the farm, they kept their Old English names: pig, cow, sheep and calf.

This was apparently to prevent the cat from being spoiled. I told her you can't raise a cat the way her aunt raised her cousins (that's where she learned this \"trick\" from). So very quickly, that kitten became my best friend since I ALWAYS have in to her every demand. That kitten had me wrapped around her little toe beans. She became old enough to be spayed but her owners didn't do it in time and she became pregnant.\n\n\nIt was kind of a creepy feeling when she wanted love and would lay on my stomach because I could feel the kittens inside her squirming. But I tolerated it because that's my girl.\n\n\nOne day her owners left the house to me when they went on a camping trip. I was washing dishes one night and my cat started screaming at me. So I followed her and she went right under the couch so I figured whatever. I'll go continue my chore. Immediately she's screaming at me again and that's when it hit me that she's telling me she's going into labor. So I coaxed her into going into a box nest/cave I made for her. She refused to let me leave. So I was her midwife as she gave birth. At one point she tried to escape when one kitten was halfway out. I stopped her and she calmed a bit before laying back down.\n\n\nShe had a healthy, beautiful litter of kittens. I felt so honored that she chose me to keep her company through that experience.\n\n\nSorry for the long post, it's one of my favorite memories of that cat. I really miss her.",

The first got stuck and didn\u2019t make it, but I had to pull the kitten out by myself to save the remaining litter and the mama. I pulled and pulled and it stretched the kitten out to a terrible length. It was horrifying and I will never forget that poor wet slippery gray little sacrifice. The other two made it, but the mama was too young and wouldn\u2019t take care of them, so I bottle fed them and raised them myself. Tough times. I look back and I\u2019m pretty proud of myself for going through with such a traumatic procedure at such a young age. It would crush my daughter to do something like that.",

No. But it's also the best way to protect the government from being influenced by not-yet-matured \"voters\" who would rather see candy machines at every stop light then actual laws that protect people.\n\nIt's not a perfect system because there will always be someone who matures quicker than their peers and as such will feel like they're being held back.\n\nBut for every 1 of those people, there are 10 complete children who can't think more than 30 minutes into the future.\n\nI was 16 once and pissed that I had to pay taxes too.

Mail, roads, fire departments, building & health regulations, public parks and so on.\n\nTaxation isn't just about representation, it's about paying for shared infrastructure that we all use. You get to choose representation even if you have no income and pay no taxes.\n\nThe flip side of this, is I pay no taxes in my home country, and I vote in every election there.

            "It's hypocritical to have fought a war over taxation without representation, sure, but at the same time, it's been totally normal throughout large parts of US history. For example, for a long time women could be taxed, but they had no voting rights. And permanent aliens (green card holders) often have to specifically sign away any future rights to citizenship (which would allow voting) as a condition for being given a green card. I have a friend from the UK who is married to a US citizen, and he had to sign such paperwork to get a green card. But part of the deal is, he has to pay taxes as though he were a citizen, even though he has no voting rights. It's just the way the US government discourages people from applying for green cards.\n\nSo, the reality is, this kind of thing happens routinely.",
            "First off, the way taxes are done now is a lot different, as is why the government taxes us. At the time of \"no taxation without representation\" the primary job of the (English parliament governing over the americas) has changed. Back then, the primary responsibility of the government was to make laws, enforce them, and to play in the games of war. The government does that all now, but also does a lot more. Things such as public schools, welfare, mass road systems, etc. There are a lot of things that they benefit from provided by the government. Not to mention that the amount of taxes most minors pay is minimal. In most states they csnt legally work a taxable job until 16 so any other taxes would most likly be something simple such as sales tax. Generally any money someone younger than 16 has is money from their parents. Their parents are legally and financially responsible for them, therefore it would more so be a tax on their parents or whoever gave them the money. And again, it's usually not a significant amount of taxes, plus it would be burdensome on everyone if minors were untaxed with general purchases and would lead to massive money loss just to implement and use such s tax free option for businesses. Plus it would be exploitable because then a parent could just make their kids \"buy\" everything. Where there is an argument is with 16 and 17 year olds. They are able to work fully taxable and regular jobs. With information being at the fingertips of most people, especially on that age group, it is arguable that their income should be untaxed,nor perhaps they should be allowed to vote as they have acess to the information and their income is taxed.

Parents now use children as tax havens. Maybe there's a workaround here like now allowing children to have income at all or capping it, but each of those feel fraught for their own reasons.\n\nOption 3 is probably the best: progressive tax law.

Ridiculous, I know, but it\u2019s the way it was.  Anyway, fast forward to middle school, and my brother and I were joining our first sports teams.  While at our physicals, the doctor made a comment about my brother having flat feet, whereas my feet were fine with a normal arch.  Later that week, as were looking at birth certificates and other documents from the hospital, we came across the baby food print certificates they made the day we were born.  My brother immediately noticed that the certificate with flat little prints had my name on it, whereas the certificate with arched foot prints had his name on it.  Obviously, at some point we got mixed up. He brought it up to our parents who just said, that basically we were stuck with the names we had gotten used to and they couldn\u2019t change anything at that point.  So now we joke about who is the real older brother and who is the fake!",

My future life flashed before me where I knew that my daughters were going to have to live their lives as the wrong child. I think my wife saw the look in my face and finally said she was joking. Worst joke ever.",

They are I think 16 now, and everyone, even mom and dad, still get them mixed up. Of course, the twins know who they are now, haha, but they enjoy pulling pranks on friends and family alike. Let's call them Hank and Tank. There's a lot of \" no mom, I'm Hank.\" \"Jeez, you told tank to do that. Not me.\"\n\nJust between us, their dad confided in me that he mixed them up twice during bath time when they were about a month old.\n\nAnd before anyone gets upset, no they don't have any food allergies or medical conditions that would cause any complications from this.

My aunt was with her- each holding a baby. They called one baby in and my mom went in with the baby. Came back out, and they were just waiting for the other twin\u2019s turn. One of us got fussy, and they switched babies\u2026then switched them back\u2026.then they got to talking and my mom said she thinks they may have switched babies again\u2026she couldn\u2019t remember.

We were newborns, and my mom hadn\u2019t looked closely at us to see if there were any distinguishing marks such as birthmarks. \n\nAfter that visit, she looked us over carefully and found a large birthmark on my back- and that\u2019s how she told us apart from then on. \n\nPlot twist- I now have identical twin girls as well- I remembered my mom\u2019s story, and put a dot of nail polish on a toenail to tell my newborns apart. \n\nAnd it turns out that one of my twins also has a large birthmark on her back. \n\nTwins are wild.",

As far as he's concerned, he's my older brother (sigh, that minute went straight to his head).  Supposedly, when we were born, there was a visible vein on my brother's nose, so that's how they told us apart.  \n\nAs a twin, this can really mess with your head if you think about it too much.

            "We have identical twin boys. When they were born one of them was almost a pound smaller than the other, so it was pretty easy to tell at that point. Then that smaller one had to go back to the hospital with Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC). He couldn't eat for over two weeks to give his bowels a chance to rest and recover while on antibiotics. They had him on TPN through a PICC line (liquid nutrition through an IV in a large vein under his upper arm). After that much time he was significantly smaller than his brother for several weeks, up to a couple of months iirc.\n\nAfter that it got harder, but that same baby also had a little hemangioma (bright red birthmark, usually temporary) in the middle of his back so if we were ever unsure (which I don't remember happening for more than a minute, and only from across the room) we could take off his shirt and check. By the time the birthmark went away we were beyond 100% confident we knew who was who without any additional help because of differences in their hair line, cow licks, face shape, mannerisms, voice, etc.\n\nToday one of them (the other one, not the one I've been talking about) has a little mole in the center of his forehead. I usually tell them apart by voice from a distance, but if they're not talking (which is never) that mole gives me a clue.\n\nSo no, we never had a time where we were less than 100% sure we knew who was who.",

She is estimated to be at least 2-4 years older than her brother based on physical growth markers; this was impossible to tell at first due to their malnutrition and later, her now diagnosed developmental delays. Despite her delays, she does seem much more mature, even taking into account the normal diiffering maturity timelines between the sexes. Boy twin has disclosed in therapy that he has dreams (or memories?) of his sister dying one night. The picture in the adoption profile is clearly the little boy, and it looks like the girl... but not *that* much like her. \n\nSo, not an accident, for sure, and not twins being mixed up, but definitely a weird mystery, and girl twin may be living as her dead half-sister.",

            "Worth noting is that despite what you see in courtroom drama in movies and TV shows, is that people also aren't sworn in as witnesses on a Bible, nor are they required to say \"so help me God\" at the end.\n\nIn fact, officially no one has to swear at all. The official oath reads \"swear or affirm\". Which was put in for religious reasons, the Bible explicitly tells Christians not to swear oaths \\[1\\] and some sects take that part seriously.\n\nThe official question is:  \"Do you solemnly (swear/affirm) that you will tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, (so help you God/under pains and penalties of perjury)?\"\n\nSince most people are Christian you mostly hear the version that applies to Christians, but the actual written oath has no religious requirement of any sort.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSame goes for the US Presidential oath of office, which is another swear or affirm type oath and has no religious reference at all. \"I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\"\n\nInterestingly enough, those 35 words are the only actual Constitutional requirement for a person becoming President. And most US Presidents during their official inauguration have flubbed it, or the person administering the oath has flubbed it. Every one of them, later, said the full oath before witnesses simply out of a bit of paranoia since it's vaguely possible to make a case that flubbing it means you aren't, technically, president.\n\nFor example, when Obama was sworn in at the big inaugural celebration he spoke over Justice Roberts, and Roberts inverted a few phrases. They had a do over a few days later with a small audience. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[1\\] Matthew 5:34 in case you're wondering. As with many things in the Bible it's more a matter of pick and choose.

            "Before you read this I would like you to know that this is not designed as a defense for all millionaires and corporations just some of the reasons often overlooked. I personally would like a lot of things to change, mostly the fiduciary responsibility and the ability to dodge taxes through private companies owning assets that are used by the person in question. This will be clearer in the second part. \n\nMost millionaires and companies don\u2019t have too much money as actual money. At least smart ones don\u2019t, it\u2019s usually in assets such as the properties those businesses own. \n\nEven millionaires who don\u2019t make their money from business usually don\u2019t technically have any wealth as it is all stored in a business through loopholes.\n\nIn normal conditions creating a business to store your wealth does two things. First it protects you from litigation. Basically if the business has never technically changed interacted with the world all of its assets can not be taken in a lawsuit. The second thing it does is allows the millionaire to only pay net income taxes because the corporate tax rate is based off of net income instead of gross income which gives them a much lower tax rate\n\nBecause this money is stored in assets. It\u2019s nearly impossible to liquidate, especially in a market like today\u2019s.\n\nThe money that is liquid goes to different things depending on that company\u2019s or millionaire\u2019s situation. If the company is public there isn\u2019t much they can legally do with the money. They can pay employees and maybe use it to refit factories to make masks or something. This is what Tesla is doing.  The problem is that the fiduciary responsibility to share holders is tied the company down from any actual charitable work as that would \u201close money\u201d \n\nIf the company is not public there is a few more things that can be done. First many ceos of non public company don\u2019t like attention so it\u2019s very likely that any charity done by them has been anonymous or at the very least kept quiet. \n\nFor the other owners of non public company or just millionaires who inherited wealth who don\u2019t donate it comes down to one of two things. First is survival. Many companies are not equipped for any crisis at this scale so many are pumping the cash they have back into the company. The other option is greed. Which seams kind of obvious. It is usually the ones who are greedy who say statements like the one you mentioned \n\n\nFrom this point on is a deeper explanation of shell companies so if you want that stay tuned otherwise this comment is done. Also note that I am not a law expert just someone who is interested in this stuff. If there are any lawyers who want to correct me on this or add anything please do so. As I said this stuff fascinates me an I would love to learn more.\n\n\nMost millionaires and pretty much all billionaires use shell companies to hold their wealth. This leaves them with almost no actual money. The way this is done is by setting up a shell company or trust that is 1% owned by the person which is technically controlling interest since the rest of the company is independent.\n\nSmarter people will control one shell company that owns many other shell companies. This umbrella shell company has no contact with the public not even business cards.  It\u2019s whole purpose is to shield and subdivide assets for legal protection. \n\nUsually there will be dozens to hundreds of smaller shell companies each of which owns a small portion of the persons wealth. For example: one company for each house, one per car, one for vacations, one for general expenses, one per location for each business controlled by the millionaire or billionaire. Basically one for each of the person\u2019s major assets or expenses. The person in question just happens to use these for themselves. \n\nThis protects all of the persons assets from legal action. Because the umbrella company never interacts with the public it legally cannot be responsible for anything so it protects all of the other umbrella companies in case one is comprised. \n\nIf the millionaire simply owned everything he/she could lose a gigantic amount of money because they crashed their BMW into a pedestrian, let\u2019s say $750,000 for medical bills lost income and attorney\u2019s fees. \n\nIf they used shell corporations they could only get sued for personal assets and the one shell company that owns the BMW. So basically nothing. The injured pedestrian will at most receive about $10,000 and a used and damaged Beamer which is probably just debit to further discourage a lawsuit (but that is an entirely different rabbit hole) with a promise that the shell company will pay the remaining $740,000 when it gets it. Which I\u2019ll never happen.\n\nThe millionaire will have the shell company declare bankruptcy and since the company is owned by an umbrella corporation his/her credit score is completely unaffected.\n\nBecause of this most of these cases never get prosecuted as it costs too much and gains nearly nothing.\n\nUsing the company to avoid taxes is a little more complicated.\n\nIt starts with the idea that in order for a personal asset/expense to be considered a company asset it has to be used for the company\u2019s interest. This is pretty easy for cars, homes, and jets for transportation to work and work at home but what about vacations. Well just \u201cwork\u201d for X amount of time and it also counts as a company expense. \n\nI put work in quotes because the legal definition of work is very lose when regarding this subject. You can meet with other wealthy people and call it work as long as everyone involved signs a paper saying they meet about business matters during the time they met. Fun fact this is one of the reasons golf is so popular among the wealthy as a long game of golf with a set of four with drinks afterwards is long enough to technically meet the threshold needed to qualify it as a work expense. Additionally it is a sport that has enough down time to discuss business matters. \n\nSo why does it matter that everything is a business expense. Well remember earlier when I mentioned that businesses are taxed on their net income. \n\nIf these were personal expenses the millionaire/billionaire would have to pay taxes first before doing all these things but since they are business expenses, their income is taxed based on how ever much money they have left over after they paid their home, car, and golf expenses. \n\nSo now you may be asking how millionaires/billionaires can be worth all this money if they technically don\u2019t own any of it. This comes down to the fact that fortune magazine and other companies that rate net worth know this and know that while theses people don\u2019t own any of it technically they receive all of the benefits of owning it with the exception of cash as that is relatively hard to put into a single shell company.",
            "They are worth millions and billions, they don\u2019t have that money. Corporations ask money when they have no more money or can\u2019t get a loan to maintain that evaluation.

            "Not sure if this is really the question you\u2019re asking, but the reason stores will ask you to round up for a certain charity is that they can take your donation and write it off on their taxes to no cost of their own.

            "Lots of them do, but you don't hear about it because they don't act like assholes. The problem is, what you do see/hear about at the ones that do behave like braggarts when they give or who spend their money on asking for others to give. There are a lot of generous people out there who are also wealthy. Also, wealth is relative. Being a \"millionaire\" doesn't necessarily mean much, especially if that wealth is on paper (hell, most homeowners in parts of CA are technically millionaires on paper). A billionaire is likely carrying most of their wealth in non-liquid form. If someone like Bezos decided to liquidate half his assets, Amazon's stock would crash (not that he'd be allowed to do so even if he wanted to...it's not that simple). It's skewed to look at what someone gives and compare it to their net worth. It's like looking at what you give and comparing it to all of your tangible assets (including any equity you have in a house, car, etc.). Pretty much just don't worry about what someone else gives. Yeah, there are lots of assholes out there who want to guilt you in to giving instead of doing it themselves. Some of those assholes are rich, some are poor. Many are politicians, even more are preachers. Some are neighbors and sometimes it's you (or me) who's the asshole (we all have our moments). Just do what you can to help others, don't advertise it and expect nothing in return. People will notice and be encouraged by it to do the same.",
