I was 3 years deep in a private sector job (fresh out of school), and while the job gave me a lot of freedom and was not too stressful, I was looking at the middle-managers and beginning to dread what my future held. Then I got saddled with my first major project and the stress/overtime was getting overwhelming. I started shopping around, but based upon my friends' experience this was typical of virtually all private sector jobs, so I was very picky and only applied to the public sector for very specific positions. I was only sending in maybe 1 application a month, but the hope got me through.\n\nFast forward to the literal day that I hand in the final project report and I get a call back on an interview I did 3 months ago for basically my \"dream\" career.

And that's when I'm like , uhhh, well like I have a job, it just kind of sucks sometimes.  Then I realize that the job I applied for doesn't look any better and I'm actually just doomed to work for a mediocre job all my life. Went to another interview once for a position I really liked. Interview was me literally designing a product for the company in an hour and the guy was very impressed. I liked the idea of being able to design so I said Ill come on board and make the switch.

Worst case, you get some more interview experience (being good at interviews is actually a really important skill) and learn more about what's out there. Best case, you get an offer that is worth taking. In the middle ground you can always leverage an offer against your current employer to get a raise too.\n\nedit: One more important point is that the landscape has changed DRASTICALLY for a lot of industries since covid. You may be surprised at how common full time remote work has become, and how much that may affect the kind of jobs and the pay ranges compared to what you can find locally.

I tried four different paths (two of them similar my roles at target and as a cook) but I got to see and meet different people, learn new skill sets and habits that will last me a life time I know how to properly check a tire, how to cook safely and delicious dishes, with the kids along with my niece I learned that I have to slow down my pace and grow patience and at target I confirmed my theory of big corporations giving a shit more about money over their employees. To be a regular joe but willing to work damn near anywhere really opened doors for me I didn\u2019t see any of these jobs as \u201cbeneath\u201d me or \u201cnot good enough\u201d I was and am a guy who needs a paycheck and they need a person for a job so I went in with a why not me mindset, I think looking at other jobs helps remind people that there are other paths that we can take and try along the way and that we can explore more within ourselves as well as the outer world.",

I am literally the only one in the office because my audiologist was at our other location that day. So I was alone and suppose to be smiling I guess.

When I got an interview I was able to get a sense for where the industry was headed, and figure out areas where I was lagging behind in what was expected. I corrected some of these through Coursera.\n\nMore importantly, it made me realize that I was actually pretty happy with my job, even with its frustrations, and that I wouldn't have really wanted to move to those other jobs (had I been offered any of them).\n\nI freely tell my group members this story. Understanding that you're in their job because you choose to be, and not because you have to be, gives increased job satisfaction.",

It is essentially impossible to asses whether something is in fact illegal if we don't know your jurisdiction. This is made more difficult regarding the lack of specificity in your post: how large are these dicks, who are you pranking, will that person think it is funny, will these dicks be visible for people passing by, is it in a high traffic area, etc...?\n3. To answer your question with complementary vagueness, this would almost certainly be illegal. Off the top of my head, this mastermind plot would likely involve some extent of trespassing to cause what theoretically could be seen as a form of harassment. Additionally, your local ordinances almost certainly have some type of language punishing obscenity/vulgarity. In sum, it is likely illegal but the most important question is whether the purported victim will care enough to call the cops. If no one can see it and the person you are pranking won't care then it will probably be fine.",

It may seem like a no-brainer, but it's often surprising what kind of things tenants will put out on a patio as patio furniture. Regulations on whether or not tenants can put snow penises on the patio should be made to ensure the maximum safety for both tenants and your property. Makeshift snow penises can lead to unsightly curb appeal and might even be dangerous. In the lease agreement addendum, it\u2019s a good idea to specify that snow penises or outdoor/garden furniture in good condition is the only allowable type. Take it a step further and clarify that any type of indoor snow penises is not allowed outside on the patio.\nYou may be asking yourself what the big deal is to have snow penis on the patio. Indoor snow penises can be damaged by rain, sprinklers or pests. If the snow penises is moved in and out frequently, water and pests can be transported inside.",

            "People with schizophrenia don't really have wholly manufactured hallucinations like you're describing, with the clown (usually, that means strong hallucinogens more than mental illness). More often than not, hallucinations are distortions of real phenomena - such as seeing shadows move, seeing patterns on the wall bend, that kind of thing. Also hallucinations happen in the brain, not necessarily in the sensory organs, as another person pointed out. \n\nThere are times when a full-on visual hallucination may happen, but they're quite rare. For example, someone born deaf (or Deaf) who has schizophrenia will usually have one of those wholly-manufactured hallucinations, like the \"clown\" you mentioned - only for them, it's usually a person (often someone they know) or disembodied hands signing in a way that would replicate hearing \"voices\". People who are hearing with schizophrenia often will not have hallucinations like this. Additionally, people who are blind from birth who have schizophrenia will often have a lot more tactile and auditory hallucinations, but if they developed a disability later on in their life, sometimes they can still \"hear\" voices or \"see\" things even if those sensory organs aren't working the way they used to. Again, evidence that these happen within the brain, and not within specific sensory organs.\n\nAlso, not to police your language but just to inform: usually it's a good idea not to refer to a person by their diagnosis (eg: \"a schizophrenic\"), and instead to refer to them in person-first language (eg: \"a person with schizophrenia\"). If you think about it in terms of cancer, we don't say \"a cancerous,\" we say \"a person with cancer.\" Hopefully you can see how using slightly more inclusive language might make people who experience schizophrenia more comfortable sharing their experiences.\n\nEdit: I'm a therapist who works in the ER helping people in crisis, and also specializes in disability.",

So I'm bipolar not schizophrenic but the two disorders are actually more similar then most problem realise. I mostly get auditory hallucinations but do occasionally see things in the corner of my eye. The things to think about with hallucinations is they really do feel real to us. I didn't know I was having them for years because I just thought what I was hearing was real. People who don't suffer them are exposed to the idea through media where watching you of course know it's not real as the watcher so it's hard to grasp how it would feel real to someone experiencing it. So imagine it like this your reading this comment on your phone/tablet/laptop now imagine tomorrow someone tells you that phone/laptop/tablet never existed, but you are so certain you read on it and typed on it. And then you realise that knowing it was fake still doesn't change the memories and the feeling of holding it. Mindfuck. So go answer the question it doesn't matter so much what focus your eyes do because to our brain at that time it will feel normal and real and we will remember it as being normal and real. ",

Being that it was LSD and I was fully lucid I wasn't weirded out or surprised or anything so I was really curious and got closer, and once I got just close enough the hallucination would kinda recede and disappear.. and I realized, after playing with it a bit, that it disappeared right about where my vision would start to get blurry from being nearsighted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was then that I found that I could kinda 'trigger' a hallucination with almost any object by just being far enough away or, after that, found out I could sorta unfocus my eyes a bit and that, too, was enough. This lead me to suspect that some of the hallucinations are our brains trying to make sense of what's there when we can't -quite- fully see it. Normally it just kinda becomes blurry, but under the influence of something like LSD the brain goes into super-pattern-finding mode and fills in all kinds of gaps that aren't there. Anything out of my visual range that I tried to see detail in would be kinda crazy, it'd just go nuts with my brain trying to fill it in rather than just leave it a kinda blurry shape, and until I got closer it would continue to change and morph, trying to fit a pattern or look properly, but generally never quite deciding fully. Unfocusing my eyes at closer range had a similar effect.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSuffice to say that, at least in my opinion, there could be some very interesting connection between hallucinations and the distance at which someone can focus with their vision or if their eyes are even focused at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat's even more interesting about the hallucinations is, despite what I was seeing and all the crazy thoughts, I felt \\*completely\\* lucid. At no point was I genuinely afraid of any of it, but I had also spent months and months reseaching, did it in a quiet and safe environment, and stuff like that, so lots of preparation and mindfulness and mental work for it.. But there was even a time when a portion of carpet became this horrendous mass of writhing viscera, and I had this distinct thought of \"holy fuck, no wonder this can freak people the fuck out,\" and it made me really empathetic for those who suffer from psychosis or had bad trips.. but at the same time I \\*knew\\* with certainty it wasn't real, and I simply focused my eyes on it and it faded.. but then I unfocused them and it returned, just as horrendous and grotesque, shifting and squirming in a way most foul, all kinds of terrible gore.. focus my eyes, and gone. Poof.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can imagine someone experiencing full psychosis who loses that mindfulness of what is going on and what is real or not, combined with hallucinations and panicked feelings.. that has to be truly terrible.",

            "There is evidence in the form of parallel (epic of Gilgamesh) accounts of a large flood that covered part of the Fertile Crescent. It is prehistory though, passed down by oral tradition, so it\u2019s unreliable, but if a flood did cover thousands of miles, like historians hypothesize, they may have thought it was the whole world.\n\nEdit to add knowledge people have dropped here:  \n- \"The Assyrian calendar is based off the end of a flood in 4750BC.\" u/kishascape07\n- \"There are also ancient Chinese mythology stories about a huge flood around the same time that with the story of Noah.\" u/PomegranateBby\n- \"Yeah, to treat Gilgamesh as separate myths entirely from the Old Testament flood is a bit silly. They're extremely similar down to both including descriptions of the arc measurements.\" u/tetsuo9000\n\nAfter looking it up (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgamesh_flood_myth) tetsuo9000 is definitely right, the stories are intertwined and from the same oral tradition.",
            "According to the narrative, the flood covered the mountains for 40 days and nights. This was part of the test for how Noah knew the flood was receding. He sent out birds and noted whether they could find places to land or not.\n\nA fisherman in a rowboat isn't going to last that long without food and potable water. They might catch fish and drink the floodwater, but with torrential downpour, there's no fire to cook or boil the water in a rowboat.\n\nIn fact, if water is falling from the sky at that rate for that long, you probably can't bail water fast enough to keep afloat.\n\nPart of the story is God telling Noah exactly how to build a boat capable of sheltering him and all the animals through the flood while everyone called him insane, because no one builds boats that way. It's ridiculous overkill in anticipation of a catastrophe with no precedent.\n\nAnyone who didn't take similar precautions didn't have a chance.",

            "You asked two questions, so I'll answer them in order. \n\nFirst, Noah wasn't the only person in the Ark; there were 8 people. The people were Noah, Noah's wife, Noah's sons, (namely Shem, Ham, and Japheth) and Noah's sons' wives. \n\nGenesis  6:18 But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.\n\nGenesis  7:7 And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.\n\nGenesis  7:13 In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark;\n\n\nSo, it wasn't only Noah by himself in the ark. \n\nAs for your second question, the most logical answer is that none of the other boats at the time were capable of surviving the storm. There were no submarines that we know of, so the only pre-flood watercraft, aside from the Ark, were surface-level boats. Also, as far as I'm aware, there were no other large boats at the time. Fishing boats existed, but no navy vessels or anything as large as the Ark was in existence at the time, as far as we know. \n\nSo, as for surviving the Flood, the Ark was the only capable ship that we know of. Take a look at the dimensions of the ship:\n\nGenesis  6:14 Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.\n\nGenesis  6:15 And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.  \n\n6:16 A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.\n\nThe Ark was massive. Depending on how tall Noah was, the \"cubit\" could have been anywhere between 1.5ft to 3ft. If we assume the smaller, we're talking about a ship that's 450ft long, 75ft wide, and 45ft high. Again, this is a massive ship. \n\nCompare the dimensions of the Ark with ships of today, and the closest modern ship you'll find is either a cruise ship or a barge. Both of those modern types of ships are built to withstand heavy winds, and they're the most stable in the water. And, since the Ark was built only for survival, it had no need for an engine, no need for a mast, and no need for any exterior fanciness. \n\nNext, notice the phrase \"pitch it within and without with pitch.\" This means the entire Ark was coated with a waterproofing substance, both inside and outside. For a ship meant for survival, this makes sense. You wouldn't want water coming in and sinking the Ark. But as far as we know, other ships of the time didn't commonly do this method of waterproofing. \n\nSo, it makes sense that other ships would sink, not being able to withstand the storms of the Flood.",
            "The real question is how did they all get to their proper places afterwards? Polar bears for example. They got off the ark and then what? They just...walked to the Arctic?",
            "Ooh! Ooh! I *kind of* know this one! [There is an excellent series of Yale lectures on YouTube that help put a lot of old Bible stories in context and finally help them make sense.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRPqtGywkCw)\n\nIn short, it's a retelling of a Babylonian great flood myth (Enuma Elish) \"localized\" into an Israelite  version to help explain how their ethnicity with their God got there, under the context of a captive population trying to preserve their identity and justify it with their own history. This is what's referred to by \"The Babylonian Exile,\" that is the historical period when the Bible was written, and understanding that exiled captives who were trying to hold onto their own ethnic identity while under Babylonian influence is key to understanding the antiquated logic behind how & why the Bible was written. \n\nNoah's flood is supposed to bookmark the end of a relatively unknown \"mythical history\" before a more reliable written record of genealogies & events could be made later in the bronze age. Even way back then, there were still ruins of even earlier civilizations lost to time. Consider that the Babylonians had a list of kings & events in their \"pre-flood\" history where kings lived ridiculously long lifespans of tens of thousands of years, doing impossible deeds & interacting directly with the gods of their people. Likewise, when the captive Israelites were writing the Bible, their pre-flood history is full of patriarchs who live 200, 500, 900 years old and directly interacted with their one monotheistic God. \n\nIt wasn't meant to be read 100% literally, that didn't start happening until far later in medieval times out of the sheer survivorship bias of Judeo-Christian mythology combining with the sheer lack of scientific dating methods. In comparison, the original bronze-age Israelite audience would've known that neighboring cultures had their own versions of similar stories (which ironically strengthened the belief of it being a \"worldwide\" event,) yet during any time in history any reasonably experienced audience of farmers and shepherds would've been aware of how impossible a task preserving all the world's animals on one boat would've been.\n\nSo on top of being an allegory for all the moral life lessons everyone else is mentioning in this thread, it's also supposed to serve as a \"second creation myth,\" albeit this time the myth is more about how the Israelite population in particular got there, rather than the whole of Earth & the universe itself.",

For example, the exonym Japan comes from the journeys of Marco Polo, who heard the Yuan Chinese call the island Cipangu. This made it's way to Europe. The word made it's way to English from the Portugese, who had heard of Japan from the Chinese and Malay people, who called it Cipan and Jipon respectively. This eventually became Japan in English. The Japanese call themselves Nippon.  The reason the English speaking world calls Duetschland Germany has to do with Rome, which called the region Germania. Since Rome ruled over Britain, it eventually called the country Germany. Other exonyms for Germany come from specific German states and Tribes people lived near, like the Spanish Alemania.

            "Cool. You can be a functioning addict and still get good grades. Been there, done that. Weed sucks motivation out of you (heavy stoner here, not some boomer with anti-weed propaganda thoughts), video games provide high levels of stimulation without doing anything in the real world, and porn tricks your brain into thinking that by doing nothing with your life you are still getting all the girls you want(this is a very deep part of the brain. it's necessary for evolution to make sex so important because that's what our species needs to survive and reproduce). Your brain is being tricked into thinking it is being highly rewarded (something that took loads of effort in the past) by doing absolutely nothing because of the high levels of stimulation constantly in your brain.\n\nIt isn't necessarily bad. But is this how you want to spend your life? You could die tonight in your sleep. Would you feel fulfilled knowing that you indulged in all the stimulating pleasure you could in the darkness of your room? Well actually, just enough pleasure so that you can keep up good grades and things to signal you have your life together as an excuse for this indulgence? If that is how you want to live your life, then it is not bad.\n\nBut imagine the potential. Imagine all the energy lost from smoking weed, all the energy being sucked into video games instead of other things, all the sex drive (extremely powerful force) being channeled into pixels on a phone screen and tissues. Now imagine all that energy being put into you forging your life into your dream. That is another possibility.\n\nIt's up to you how you want to spend your time in this sack of flesh, bodily fluids, and bones that we use as a vehicle for exploring this planet and current life. Do what you want. Seek truth within yourself and you will find all the answers you need.\n\nThe reason I wrote all this out is that I relate to you. I am an addict. Addicted to weed, porn, and stimulation online. This whole message is basically a message to me. I love you,\n\nedit: thanks for all the awards and positive feedback guys, it really motivated me to stay true to my word and to not be the person who gives great advice but behaves otherwise.",

And you can keep on jacking off, gaming, and smoking; it\u2019s all about balance",
            "I know this is really long. I'm really hoping you'll read it. It won't take more than 10 min.\n\nHi there! I\u2019m an addict. This comment is not a post about how you are an addict. I'm only providing some knowledge about my experience and trends that I've noticed in my community of recovery. I've been clean for 3.25 years. My main drugs of choice are alcohol and marijuana. You should see the looks I get in the rooms of some recovering heroin/meth addicts (some, not all!) when I mention marijuana as one of my addictions. You should see the looks I get from pot heads (most, but not all) when I mention marijuana. You\u2019ve never seen such judgement! The thing is, I actually know a lot about addiction and the science behind it. I\u2019m not official, but 10 years of struggles since I first started down the path of recovery has brought me a lot of research and education (and many many addiction therapists). Here\u2019s something no one wants to admit: you can be addicted to *anything*.\n\nA little anecdote, from a book/program called ACOA (Adult Children of Alcoholics): one guy finally got himself sober and one of his coping mechanisms was exercise, specifically running. He ran every day. Then twice per day, before/after work. Then sometimes he would even go on his lunch. He actually became obsessed with running. He started running marathons, travelling across the country to do it all the time. They asked his kids \"how is life now that your dad's sober?\" And they said \"well at least when Dad was drunk he was actually here.\"\n\nYou can be addicted to drugs, exercise, food, porn, real sex, reading, spending money, video games, movies/TV, social media (that's a crazy relatively new one), self-harm... the list goes on and on. All of those things do the same thing in our brain, but in different ways and to varying degrees: dopamine release. Drugs and alcohol (they're the same thing, and yes weed falls in there as well) are the ones that get all the attention because the dopamine release is SO MASSIVE compared to other more everyday things. And subsequent addicted abuse of the substances results in exponential drop-off of that dopamine reward, and drug abusers end up chasing that same dopamine release they got the first time by using more quantity more often, which only exacerbates the exponential diminishing return (hence the phrase \"chasing the monkey\").\n\nOne thing recovered addicts have to be careful of and almost always fall prey to is \"cross addiction.\" Which is not an official term as far as I know, but recognized as a very real thing is the scientific and recovery communities. But it's what it sounds like: I got sober from marijuana and alcohol and I got addicted to playing video games. I treat video games the same way I would treat drugs, in some ways more/less than others. I stay up doing it until 4 am when I have work in the morning, I let it get in the way of my relationships, I neglect other responsibilities so I can keep playing, it's sometimes the VERY first thing I think of when I wake up. Sometimes the way I play video games is crazy. It's scary. You'd think the world was ending with the way I sometimes compulsively obsessed over playing and couldn\u2019t even find 5 minutes to take the dog out or answer my mom\u2019s phone call. They've studied the addictivity of video games. I can't tell you a lot about those results, but I do remember they were shocking, and it didn't take very much to show me there was an issue. Same with porn. One study found porn to be as addictive as cocaine. That I can absolutely believe. I still struggle with both, but I refuse to give up video games. One day I hope I can drop the porn. (And here\u2019s the part where I\u2019m going to sound like an addict, notice how I justify my behavior.) The good news is, I don't think I'll have to give up VG. With drugs, the most effective recommendation so far for addicts to turn their lives around is total abstinence. There are very rarely cases where addicts can taper down to occasional recreational use, or abstain for an extended time and then go back to recreational use. That's because of the way the dopamine release works. (TLDR it's so powerful it has hijacked some 500 million years of evolution. FUCKING. CRAZY.) But the dopamine reward for video games isn\u2019t anywhere near the level that it is for drugs, and for that reason I believe I've been able to check myself over the years. Make no mistake tho, it is still a struggle. Just one I'm willing to accept. (<--again, justification. I\u2019m aware of it. But, conversely, that doesn\u2019t mean the points/justifications aren\u2019t valid, in some way at least. As you can already tell, these can be very very complex issues for all of us in recovery.)\n\nI tell you all this because I'm guessing you're young. I'm almost 33. I\u2019m still young and I still have a lot to learn. I realized I was an addict at 23, and I\u2019ve learned much since, but I don't know if I fully accepted my addiction until I was 30. Again, I am ***not*** here to say you're an addict. Yet. But I can tell you you sound a helluvalot like me (and a helluvalot like many young people; you are not alone). I'm not saying you should stop smoking weed, definitely not saying stop playing video games, but I am saying if you don't find other things to occupy your life (I know it sounds fucking wild but helping others will bring you immense satisfaction), to strike a balance, you are definitely leaving the door wide open to the possibility of the very common occurrence of some very unpleasant struggles to walk right in to your life, and when they come they will not leave. Once they are there, they are there to stay. Forever. Also, giving your brain some time to mature before you go crazy with the substances may be a worthwhile investment. Evidence has shown people who wait until 22-23 before drinking have much better ability to control their habits. On the flip side those who begin drinking at 16-20 or earlier often experience emotionally arrested development and their brains never develop the \"off switch\" that tells them when it's time to chill. And alcohol is no different from marijuana or reading or eating: it's allllll dopamine.\n\nI hope this helps you or provides some insight. I wish I would've heard this when I was younger. I may have been told, but I certainly didn't hear it. I know it sounds like lecturing, but I don't know how else to say it. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you need.\n\nedits: formatting",

You wouldn\u2019t be helping anyone other than yourself, and you\u2019re not exactly helping yourself even with those three. Weed can also be harmful if not used properly, and especially at your age. \n\nAt your age it will be very helpful for your future to find things that increase your productivity and work ethic, because you\u2019ll have to work at some point. If you have no other passions you might find it increasingly hard to find and stay in a good job or to have close friends later in life. So it\u2019s more so the mentality you are developing that is bad by doing just this than the actual act of doing either if that made sense.

Your body will want more and before you know, you're ruining your health. Nothing wrong with either of those things, but they will dull your brain out if you do not feed it any creative stimulus.",
            " The biggest risk is to your health. Unless you're eating mostly healthy food in healthy portions, then your health will certainly suffer.  It might not be something that is going to kill you necessarily, but it'll definitely take some years off your life in the end.  Ancestrally humans were nomadic and hunter/gatherers, we aren't really physiologically build for a sedentary lifestyle.  Furthermore there are serval studies showing that a big part of building a healthy mind and helping with memory (which is properly suffering from the weed) is wandering and wondering.  So it's important to both navigate the outside world and the inside of your own mind.  If you're eating a bunch of sugars and carbs it'll be easy to get overweight.  These are really good at providing your body with energy and if you aren't doing anything to use this energy then it's going to get put into storage (likely as fat).\n\nThis is coming from someone that broke out of these same habits about 5-6 years ago.  Honestly, when smoking, games, and beating dick was my life I had no complaints.  For the most part I would consider myself happy.  I had friends to play games with and life wasn't complicated.  But then I started going back to school, started trying to work out, went on some hikes, got back into disc golf and snowboarding, and spent more time hanging with my friends I'm the real world.  Let me tell you now, just because you're happy doesn't mean you can't be happier.  I lost like 40lb in a year and started rock climbing as another hobby.  Having a wide range of things to do that you enjoy just makes all of life better, variety is the spice of life, after all.  It also is great to be in school (or a trade as someone has mentioned) something you're passionate about that can give you a strong sense of accomplishment.  While your lifestyle can be fun, it's important to note it can be very temporary.  If I was still living that life today, even though I was happy then, I would be horribly depressed now.  I love playing games with friends way more than by myself, and I hardly get to do that more than 2-3 times a week if I'm lucky these days.  If I would have stayed were I was, all my friends would have still moved on.\n\nWhile I don't think the way you're living your life is bad necessarily, I don't think it's healthy or maintainable.  I would recommend picking up some hobbies that let you explore the world and find fulfillment.  Even just learning a new skill and going on hikes or walks could be a huge change.  It's hard to make these changes once you're in this spot, the weed makes you kinda just want to chill until you start smoking outside in pretty places.  But guess what? Even after all these new hobbies I've started, a full time job, and being a student I still smoke weed and play video games for at least a few hours 9/10 days.  You can keep doing what you're already doing, but you can also do so much more at the same time.\n\nHope you're well and I hope this helps.",

Some people have to ask what it is, and it only takes, like, 2 extra seconds to do, and I\u2019m very proud of it.\n\nI started doing it years ago because I had the realization that nobody could stop me. There\u2019s no where in the law that says I can\u2019t do it, plus, I really love dragons. I\u2019ve never looked back since then. I even drew it on my driver\u2019s license and other legal documents since then and haven\u2019t experienced any problems yet. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m gonna get arrested for some extra lines at the end of my name, and what\u2019s the government gonna do? Judge me? People have told me \u201cyou can\u2019t do that,\u201d but I haven\u2019t really heard any reason with an external consequence.\n\nAnyways, I\u2019m in college now, and I\u2019m at this point wondering if this is something I should continue. In my eyes, it\u2019s something completely harmless that gives me enjoyment, but I\u2019ve been thinking maybe I should stop as I am developing into a professional. Developing into a professional is especially important as I\u2019m in music education to become a band director, and (as with most things but even more so for educators) a good standing with colleagues and students is supremely important, so it makes me wonder if I should cut it out with the dragon as to not appear childish to potential employers and other musicians in my profession. I personally don\u2019t thing it\u2019s childish- I think it\u2019s completely harmless- but perhaps I\u2019m being blind sighted. Could it actually have an impact on my future career and the respect I demand?\n\nSorry that was long, but any input would be appreciated.\n\nTL;DR, I quickly draw a dragon next to my name both in print and in my signatures. To me, it\u2019s completely harmless, but could it have an impact on my future career or some other unforeseeable consequence?\n\nEDIT: Oh dang, I didn't expect this to get so much attention. Thank you everybody for your advice and input! Lots of people have asked for the dragon, so here he is.

            "Ok a lot of people are saying you have to be consistent across documents and that just isn\u2019t true legally. As long as your intention is for a mark to be your signature, you can make that mark whatever you want. It can be a smiley face, an X, a dragon, your name, literally anything, and you can make it something different every time. As long as you intend what you write down to be your signature, it legally becomes your signature.\n\nNow on the other hand, the reason most people sign with their names is because on legally binding agreements, the other party will feel more comfortable if your name is being used in your signature. It would be easier to prove in a court of law that you have to uphold your side of the contract if your name is written there. If you sign the contract with just a smiley face you might be able to convince the court that it wasn\u2019t you who signed it or that you didn\u2019t intend it to be a signature because it is more unorthodox. The contractor may not want to take that risk and require your name to be in your signature for their own peace of mind (but it sounds like the dragon is just an addition, which shouldn\u2019t negate your name being there so it\u2019s fine).\n\nHave fun with your dragon and keep signing on!",

So if your govt issued ID signature is a dragon you\u2019re good as you showed proof to get an ID and signed in person.

            "Ooooh - geek heaven!\n\nI take signatures for a living.\n\nYes, there are real world consequences to the style of signatures people use.  Generally, the makers of the document determine the nature of the signature required, based on laws, rules and company or government policies.  Colour of the ink used, and even the type of pen used can also be important. \n\nFor example, many title companies in the US will only let you sign using the exact version of your name that is printed on the documents (no flourishes).  Other variants on your name will lead to your documents being refused in those States\u2019 title registries.  \n\nThere is a country in south-east Asia that will send specific pens out to be used for signatures - if you don\u2019t use that specific pen, your signature on the document won\u2019t be accepted.\n\nCanadians are much less fussed about the style of a signature as a rule, but you do need to follow certain rules if you are signing on behalf of another person, making your mark (signing with an \u201cX\u201d) or signing as an agent.  You can\u2019t simply sign with an \u201cX\u201d, unless you use the specific \u201csigning with a mark\u201d signature block.\n\nSometimes these practices are in place because of tradition, and sometimes because of technology (some older scanners can\u2019t read certain kinds of ink colour or weight).\n\nPictorial elements are generally discouraged on formal documents, because they have little to do with a representation of your name, and they do not match up with the gravity a signature implies.  You don\u2019t sign a document unless you mean to be bound by it, and signing with \u201ccutesy\u201d flourishes makes it seem as though you are not taking your signature, or its importance seriously enough.  If you want to incorporate a pictorial or symbolic visual element, you are really then making a seal, not a signature.  Go ahead and use a designed seal, but don\u2019t combine it with your signature.\n\nI can (and have) refused to take signatures on documents when the client refused to comply with formatting and content requirements of certain signatures/documents.\n\nI had a client once advise me that he signed all documents using a script version of the word \u201cwhatever\u201d.  He had signed his name on his driver\u2019s licence this way, and told me that he always used this \u201csignature\u201d for documents.  When I asked why, he advised that he just never cared enough about whatever it was that he was signing, so he thought it was funny to sign documents in this way.  I refused to take his signature not only because he was being disrespectful to the law and the gravity of the situation, but also because if he was that flippant about what he was signing, then I didn\u2019t feel comfortable that he was demonstrating the elements of legal capacity required to do what he was doing.  He got mad, and my reply was \u201cwhatever\u201d....\n\nI would suggest you create a formal signature that you use on your identification, banking and legal documents, and then a more informal one incorporating your visual elements for everyday, informal use.",

The older I got the more I understood though and felt less bothered but the feeling never left. I mostly hated when people  would randomly be like \u201couch! Did that hurt!!!\u201d like completely assuming that I knew what they were talking about, because those piercings were all that mattered. That always bothered me so with that said, there were many times when I would go out of my way to wear something to make sure that they wouldn\u2019t show, or I\u2019d keep my arms covering my breasts. I dated one guy for several months and he was obsessed with them and that\u2019s when I learned how sensitive my nipples became. Before that I didn\u2019t feel much around there. So I fell in love with them all over again because I realized how fun they were tooo.  \nMy current bf is a huge fan of them, they freak him out a little\u2014he\u2019s kind of  conservative. That was annoying at first but he got used to it . They closed super quickly and I wasn\u2019t prepare for that. \ud83d\ude1e So I plan on going back one day to get them redone.",
            "It adds an extra element. Just like how a tongue piercing can add a little something extra, so can this. Personally I love switching between a bar and a ring so I feel the difference in sensations. Bar is best because lots of people assume s ring means yank and twist and harm me so I usually go for a bar. Also it looks sexy as hell. I'm a big fan of them. ALSO ONE OF THE WORST PIERCINGS TO GET AS A DUDE. 9.0/10 ALMOST PASSED OUT. But 10/10 would do again",

            "Mine are for me and my husband, I think they are pretty, he thinks they are sexy, but the main reason I had them done is because I had no sensitivity whatsoever in my nipples but now I can feel the slightest touch. Plus, they are fun to play with.",

            "All my piercings are purely for my own aesthetic pleasure",
            "I got them because I\u2019ve always felt self conscious about my chest and getting them pierced boosted my confidence. My nipples were already sensitive so it didn\u2019t really do anything in that department but they makes me feel a little sexy and my partners usually like them so it\u2019s a win-win.",

            "I had mine done twice.  \n\n\nThe first time was before my first kid. I got them done for my own stimulation. For the first two weeks, the mere weight of a sheet on the nipple was blissful. Alas, they didn't keep that heightened level of sensitivity, but oh my word when they did...  \n\n\nI took them out for the baby and was told I could not breastfeed because that much milk coming out of all the holes at once would possibly choke the baby. They tried helping me pump, but I ended up not being able to produce enough at first anyways and they urged formula to be mixed in with whatever I got.  \n\n\nDid any of you ever see that meme with the fountain of a woman's bare breasts being where the water comes out, and the caption is \"Calm your tits\"? About two weeks after the baby was born, I went into the shower and my breasts EXPLODED. I could squeeze and get milk going in all directions from both breasts. It was crazy! Years later, when I saw that meme, all I could think about was that time in the shower and laugh my ass off!  \n\n\nYears later, after the second kid, I decided to treat myself and get them redone. It was a bit more painful the second time around, but still JUST AS BLISSFUL for those two weeks. I kept them for years until one day, I saw a spectacular point being made about old people with piercings frying off their nipples the day they ever need to be defibrillated. It made me reconsider a few choices, lol.  \n\n\nI tried seeing if the holes are fully closed and they are about half closed? I can get the piercing through one side, but not the other. I could probably break it if I wanted and \"pierce\" myself, but nah. I do have to continue cleaning maintenances. Sometimes my nipples feel a little itchy and I know it's time. I get a hot compress on each nipple for several minutes and then give them a good squeeze, rolling back the edges of each hole and squeezing. A sort of \"cheese\" comes out, very smelly. A few google searches call it \"nipple waxing\", so apparently I'm not abnormal, lol. It's gross, though, and I scrub it often to avoid a build-up.   \n\n\nStill, I don't regret either time I pierced. It was amazingly fun. And, too, I did like showing them off. ;)  \n\n\nOh, I found the meme here on reddit... of course!  :D  \n\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1xsyxo/calm\\_your\\_tits/](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1xsyxo/calm_your_tits/)"
