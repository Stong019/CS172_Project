The \"nontarget market effect.\" When we see an ad that was meant for another type of person, we feel really intense negative feelings like resentment, disgust, irritation, anger. This is a documented effect of mistargeted advertising and is why \"wasted coverage\" is such a bad thing.\n\n2. Ads rarely try to have an effect on you immediately. The interruptive kind rarely strive for emotional impact, even. Awareness is usually the goal. By the time you've seen an ad with a clear brand or product 3 times, you'll remember that brand or product the next time you have the problem the ad addresses. That's usually an ad's point.

Now, because you would probably be sued for putting a five year old in a professional rowboat on water (although the water was added in post production), they didn\u2019t risk it.

            "I work for an FMCG company in marketing and as much as I hate ads as a consumer, they do work!\n\nI used to work on a diaper brand and you'd think most diaper ads are the same and the people will only buy because of product performance. \nThree key things here\n1. People are always switching brands (leaky bucket effect). You gotta keep filling it up as some of it keeps leaking. And how much you advertise increases how 'mentally available' you are and how much people people pick you up in store. A bulk of sales comes from people who are not loyal to any brand \n2. Autopilot - most people shop on autopilot and this is where ads work. If someone says 'dandruff', you definitely think of Head & Shoulders / Clear. That's advertising\n3. Perceived performance Vs Actual Performance - most products perform the same. Most detergents clean equally well, most diapers absorb similar. But the fact that the diaper YOU use has never leaked + other moms have stories of leaky diapers (might even be your brand) = you are not changing. Even if the actual performance in a lab might be th same. \n\nThe job of advertising is to get you to try if you're unhappy with your existing product. Repurchase is on the product to sell itself and perform. It's about being popular and being easily accessible to your autopilot mode, more than other products.",

            "Psych major and currently employed in the advertising field: I hate most ads. There are some that simply make you more aware of a thing existing and put the onus on the viewer to look further (call this number, visit our site, etc). But many try to manipulate the viewer into thinking a certain way, and it bothers me a lot. Many people feel these ads don't work on them, but they often do have an effect on their cognition they may not be aware of.\n\nThe most obvious form and one most people are aware  of is the use of classical conditioning. See X thing paired with (product), and viewer will think of X when they think of (product). In the US, millions of dollars spent on beer commercials that feature beaches, bikini clad women, trucks, and America paraphernalia all with the goal of making people think about all the \"good, American fun times\" things when they think of beer, esp. a few specific brands of beer.\n\nThing is, many of these things work whether the viewer is aware or not. Classical conditioning specifically has shown that even when participants are educated on what CC is and how it works, and then informed that they will then undergo conditioning to illicit a desired response, CC still works. (one example: https://www.jstor.org/stable/3172667?seq=1). On the other hand, knowledge of these systems can also be used to help people (example: abuse victims who have developed fear or hatred for certain people who represent their abuser can overcome these feelings through repeat positive exposure to these people. It's especially effective if the individual is aware of how these mechanisms work and actively seek to use them). \n\nWe each have hundreds of associations that many don't think about much, and advertising plays a role. From pink things for girls and blue things for boys, beer and sports fans going hand in hand, perceptions of gamers being mostly male, and on and on, these associations often have advertisers in part to blame. It's also why some, who are aware of these affects, push for representation in media that don't reinforce negative stereotypes.\n\nSo, yes, I hate advertising and feel the same distaste. But be careful not to discount their influence. Advertising is one of the biggest industries there is, and for good reason. It works.",
            "Yes. In some other countries, they have art or plants all over the place. Here you can only see ads and business logos.",
            "People are taking the piss out of you everyday. They butt into your life, take a cheap shot at you and then disappear. They leer at you from tall buildings and make you feel small.

They have access to the most sophisticated technology the world has ever seen and they bully you with it. They are The Advertisers and they are laughing at you.\nYou, however, are forbidden to touch them. Trademarks, intellectual property rights and copyright law mean advertisers can say what they like wherever they like with total impunity.\nFuck that. Any advert in a public space that gives you no choice whether you see it or not is yours. It\u2019s yours to take, re-arrange and re-use. You can do whatever you like with it. Asking for permission is like asking to keep a rock someone just threw at your head.\nYou owe the companies nothing. Less than nothing, you especially don\u2019t owe them any courtesy. They owe you.

I asked a few doctors about it, and the best explanation we could come up with, is that as you fall asleep, you lose proprioception - the awareness of where your limbs and things are, in relation to your body.   \nWhen you literally can't feel where your libs are, the brain tends to do some dumb shit, and try to just come up with something to fill the void. That's when your confused, sleepy brain makes you feel all spinny, or huge, or small, or whatever.  \nUsually, this happens after you've fallen asleep, but sometimes the process doesn't go as planned, and you go through this process while still somewhat awake.",

            "It's vertigo!\nMany children have ear infections or equilibrium issues due to the bone that sits at the base of your skull, the first cervical vertebra, called the Atlas (named after the Greek god who held up the entire world). It's the only bone in the body that can fully rotate and is responsible for your ability to move your head up and down/back and forth, etc.\nThis bone sits directly behind something called the Eustachian tube which, when Atlas is out of alignment, puts pressure on the Eustachian tube which can cause equilibrium issues like vertigo and also chronic ear infections in children. \n\nAtlas subluxation (when a vertebra is out of alignment, causing pressure on a joint) is often caused in children due to a traumatic birth process or trauma to the head at a young age, as kids are quite apt to hit their head against things pretty hard when they are little. \n \nHere's a fun fact!\nI'm a patient care coordinator at a chiropractor's office, and when I do new patient intake, one of the first questions I ask is if the patient had ear infections as a child. If they did, they are also likely to have digestion, breathing or reproductive problems as adults. This is because the direct innervation of the Atlas is to control all these systems (and many more). So if a child had chronic ear infections, that child begins with a subluxated Atlas, and if it is never corrected or adjusted by a chiropractor, the pattern continues and you are likely to have issues like digestion problems, asthma, allergies, heavy irregular periods in women, cysts, fibroids, etc.\n\nSo, if you had ear infections as a child, a traumatic birth process (ask your mom!), or were hit in the head or neck super hard, you very well might have had a subluxated Atlas, causing pressure on the Eustachian tube, making you feel like the room was spinning when you laid down. Kids often \"grow out of this,\" though if the subluxation is not corrected it just turns into other issues as an adult. Hope this helps!",

What you're describing, I always thought it was a panic attack because it happens when I'm overthinking. I always have to open my eyes and focus on an object to stop the spinning sensation. \n\nEar infections are common as a kid, so maybe it was vertigo in your case since that's related to the inner ear?",

I remember it started when I was around 8, I couldn't be face up cause it would cause everything to spin, I started sleeping on my stomach with my head as straight as possible, cause my side would also spin.\n\nIt faded away when I was like 20-22, I had a mark on my chin from where my head would rest on my hand to keep it straight.",

At recess I would play on the swing, and that night I would lay in bed and feel the sensation of going back and forth, just like the swing. Sometimes I would just spin to get dizzy, and that night I'd feel the direction of spin in bed again. I've refelt vibrations from tools and all sorts of other stuff. Is this similar?",
            "Holy shit I had/still have this so often. I even slammed my head into the adjacent wall multiple times in my childhood as a result.",

            "No, although in my 20-30's suffered it a few times from drinking too much!",
            "For me it felt more like a roller coaster going up and down. Or like I was floating on waves",
            "Yes!! my bed wouldn't spin, it would rock. first, the head coming up. then the opposite side coming up. and it would repeat, like i was in a wobbly plane. i never knew what this was",
            "On rare occasion I have a feeling that my head and upper body are falling backwards while simultaneously my surroundings spin forwards, it's strange...",
            "I had this as a child too, its was actually painful to spin so much I thought I'd split in half. \n\nThankfully at some point that stopped and hadn't happened since.",
            "Not exactly this but I had this feeling as a kid a lot and occasionally recently where It feels my body is rising to the ceiling and then back to the bed and it feels almost like a pulsing/rocking motion, I can never explain it and makes my head feel pretty foggy",
            "It\u2019s still happening to me but becoming less of an issue with age. Idk what it\u2019s called- but I think you outgrow by about 16-17",
            "Dude I get this too!! It feels like I\u2019m rocking on a boat and sometimes it spins around. I use it as a tool to fall asleep haha!",
            "I still feel this way and I'm 23",
            "Sounds like maybe you had benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. I had a friend that had that issue, had something to do with changes in head positioning setting off the vertigo (at least, that's how I understood what she explained). Rarely happens to her anymore, but I'm not sure if she outgrew it or what. \ud83d\ude15",
            "It happened to me a lot during puberty, then occasionally as an adult around menstruation. I always wondered if maybe it was lack of iron or oxygen in my blood?",
            "Yeah I had that occasionally too. I also get it as an adult if I'm drunk.",
            "I get this occasionally and I actually like the way it feels",

            "I'm in the UK and this is definitely a huge issue for millennials (I'm 30).  I went to a prestigious uni, so you'd think most of my friends went into good careers and earned money and are looking to have babies and set up their pensions now, right?\n\nNo. \n\n90% of my uni friends, very intelligent people with good degrees, work in retail or freelancing in creative industries where they are always trying to make ends meet.  The vast majority of them have to live in London for work, and so they rent tiny rooms in shared houses.  I know people of 28 who can't move out of their parents' houses because of sky high renting prices.  The only person I know with his own house sadly got the deposit because his mother died and her life insurance paid out.\n\nWe're a lost generation.  I think many of us will be too old to have children before we can financially afford them.",
            "Same issue in Canada.\n\nEdit: I live in a desirable area of my country, but still a relatively small city. To buy a house here, most houses hit over $600,000 minimum. I\u2019m currently looking in the $400,000 to $600,000 range and there is essentially one neighbourhood I can live in, and maybe a dozen choices. For reference this is in the small town next to the actual \u201ccity\u201d.\n\nIf I want to live in a trailer, townhome, or other complex (generally with restrictions), I can go lower. But many of those places are 55+, adults only, high strata fees, or small/no pets. \n\nAlso, for people here commenting that you should live in more rural areas, there are often not jobs there, and commuting in my province is very expensive. We have very expensive car insurance and gas here. I already commute one town over to get to work. Combined, my spouse and I pay $500/month in gas and $380/month in car insurance. And no, we can\u2019t use public transport, because it isn\u2019t very functional here. \n\nWe are fortunate that post-secondary education here is cheaper than the states. My 6 years and two degrees cost me roughly $55,000 in school expenses (not including living costs while attending, that\u2019s just tuition and books).\n\nFor reference minimum wage here is $13.85.",
            "In Finland, not as bad, but trending towards that. Pay is dragging behind the increasing cost of living, because we need to remain *competitive in EU internal and global markets,* which apparently can only be done with wages. Not by for example, making Finland more friendly to startups and small and medium sized companies, and entrepreneurs.\n\nHere the issue isn't student debt in the same way as in USA. Biggest issue is that  we are trending towards rental work, gig work, short contracts. Add to that wages not keeping up with cost of living, new homes becoming more and more expensive, and urbanisation. Every one wants to move to the few growth centres, because that is where most of the jobs and study places are.\n\nThe only realistic way to get your own home and car, is to be a couple, and pay them off together. Ok, granted, if you train in to a high paying job like doctor, engineer, lawyer. Sure. But we are turning in to a nation of singles living in studio apartments.\n\nWhen my parents built their first home, a house in '94 about 190 m\\^2, it was about 150.000\u20ac in Finnish marks. It was sold about 13 years later for over 360.000\u20ac, now a house like (same age, same kind of location) that goes for 450.000\u20ac. Our 2nd home, it was a apartment in two floors - 118m\\^2, was about 150.000\u20ac and it was in proper ruins everything had to be renovated, and the building was from 70's, it was sold for 365.000\u20ac, about 10 years later.\n\nNow what skews the house prices here is that, in growth centres homes especially new ones get sold basically instantly for great amounts of money. Go bit outside the region, and you can't sell a home. There are places which are basically giving them away. There are counties which are giving all sorts of bonuses and incentives so people would move there, especially families. No one is moving there because there really aren't many jobs, or security for long contracts. The jobs that there are mainly industrial jobs. And since there are no jobs and services, no one wants to move there. Even doctors don't want to take well paid spots there, because they'd rather be in the cities.",

            "Canadian here. Definitely the same here. My parents bought their first house in Calgary in 1980 for $30,000. The exact same house (it's still there, in a more central part of Calgary, desirable neighbourhood) is now worth somewhere between $600,000-$800,000. The house my mom owns they bought in 1991 for $120,000 and is now worth $550,00. \n\nI'm 40, my husband and I bought our first house when we got married, 2002. We paid $148,000. Sold the house in 2006 for $360,000, used the money we made and bought 3 acres of land outside the city for much less than it would cost today ($200,000), built a house using a construction mortgage (not available anymore), total amount mortgaged was $350,000. We currently owe some $250,000 or so. Our house is valued in around $800,000, we could likely get more. We can pay all our bills on one income, we have 5 kids.\n\nMy sister is 5 years younger than me, she bought her first house in 2008 for $365,000, with help with the down payment from my parents. It was a small house in a less popular area. She sold it for about what she paid for it, maybe slightly more, in 2014 and bought a larger house with her now husband for $450,000. They were thrilled because the house was undervalued for a quick sale and they jumped on it. They both work and struggle to pay their mortgage, they just had their first child and my sister is going to have to go back to work sooner than they'd hoped.\n\nJust 5 years difference between us, but I *just* squeaked in on the \"cheap\" end of the housing market and was able to build on that and take advantage of cheaper rural property prices and mortgage plans/rates that are no longer available. I bought my first house when I was 22, my sister when she was 23. Mine was 1,600 sqft in a nice area for 148,000 with a great interest rate, hers was 1,000 sqft in a less desirable place for $365,000 with a poor interest rate. Since then, the housing market continues to remain high. It's not likely that you can find a (livable) house for less than $350,00-$400,00 in the city anywhere, most condos are more than that. The price remains fairly consistently high for 1.5 hours or so outside the city. We live 30 min away, our neighbours are almost all in their 60's/70's. The people next to our neighbour just sold their house (slightly larger than ours) for 1.6 million.\n\nIt's so arbitrary and unfair. I have no idea how our kids will ever break into the housing market.\n\n**Edited to add, my 4 year degree in Graphic Design from a good university cost me a grand total of $11,000. My oldest kids are going to be going into university in the next few years, they can expect to pay more *per year* than I did total. The same program I did currently runs at about $13,000/year. I only had to borrow some $5000 and it was paid off shortly after I graduated. My son is looking at a PhD and can expect to walk away having paid some $80,000. We've been putting aside money for University since they were born, but never imagined this level of inflation, our kids will still have a *significant* leg up and can hope to only carry half the cost of their education. That's still going to be 8 times what debt I had. Compared to other places, post-secondary education here is *still* super affordable.",

            "It\u2019s very true in New Zealand.\n\nThere\u2019s always someone in the papers blaming millennials for eating too many avocados or going out too much, but here\u2019s some perspective.\n\nAverage house price in Auckland (biggest city) - $830,000\n\nMinimum wage in New Zealand - $17.70 per hour. x40 hours = $708 per week = $36,816. After tax at a ~~low-ish estimate of 20%~~ correct and exact 14.82% (thanks for the correction u/NZ_Diplomat) and you\u2019re left with ~~$29,453~~ $31,361.\n\nThat means if you\u2019re a single person, put ALL 100% of your after-tax wages (no eating, no electricity) into your mortgage, then if your bank was super generous (spoiler alert - they\u2019re not) and charges you NO interest, then in approx ~~28~~ 26.5 years you will have paid off your mortgage. A little less time though, because you HAVE to have at least 10% deposit (most banks require 20%) so you\u2019ve had to save at least $83,000 before you can even get that mortgage which would lower the number of years to pay it back... but then it goes back up once you add the interest. Don\u2019t forget though... no eating or electricity or literally anything else for those ~~28~~ 26.5(+) years.\n\nSuper doable right?\n\nFor those about to say \u2018well go live in a small town then, not one of the main cities\u2019 and not eat, have no electricity, pay 0% interest on said mortgage (impossible), here\u2019s some other religions:\n\nHawkes Bay - $520,000 (~~17.6~~ 16.5 years) Northland - $539,000 (~~18.3~~ 17 years) Nelson - $609,000 (~~20.7~~ 19.5 years) Canterbury - $460,000 (~~15.6~~ 14.5 years) Taranaki - $430,000 (~~14.6~~ 13.7 years)\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder some of the youngens feel despair at their options.\n\nEdit: Just want to be clear, I'm not saying there aren't people who aren't really trying and are then complaining they can't make it... because there are. I'm just saying that for those that genuinely are trying as hard as they can, it can still be near-insurmountable regardless of the level of effort they put in.\n\n**Edit 2: It was bought to my attention that I'd estimated the lower tax rate a bit too high when I first posted this, so I went and checked the figures and have changed all calculations so they are exact (the correct ones are next to the incorrect ones which have a strikethrough, in the interest of transparency). The intention wasn't to mislead and I'm not sure it make the numbers seem much better, but always best to get information as close to correct as possible.

I also live in Vancouver, BC where $800,000+ only gets you a small condo. House insurance rates also just went up a ridiculous 40%, causing many to lose their homes.

Most Boomers and GenX's own enough property and could secure loans to build houses for their GenX and Millennial children. Depending on where you live, having one extra apartment for renting is not that uncommon (mostly to teachers, military personnel, and university students).\n\nOlder Millennials do own houses, especially married ones who live in the provinces. The first adjustment for the financial crisis of 2009, was parents moving out for one of their married children to move in (houses built in the late '80s and '90s are in very good condition). This, however, doesn't seem to make living much easier, because of \"emergency\" taxes which don't get retracted.\n\nVirtually all citizen debt is towards private banks, which have debts themselves. Any state subsidization citizens might get, is nontaxable and nonconfiscatory. Banks get direct state subsidization and/or debt write offs. This keeps private debt the same, interests rising, and interest rates for new loans rising as well.\n\nThere's more motivation for working as an employee, than owning a small business. There's as little motivation for owning property, as there is for renting. I believe the only business role that's on the rise (besides the inheritor), is the small and medium franchiser.",

This means about ten years of work while renting (and overpaying to random strangers, often more than you would pay to a bank) before you even _get a mortgage_. Then it's 25 or 30 years of paying it down, and many banks refuse to give mortgages to people who are 35+ because they're too old...\n\nAvoiding debts, aside from mortgages, is reasonable - there are public schools and universities, most jobs include health-related benefits, etc. But getting your own place?

            "Romania here. Education is free or not that expensive, but the salaries are low and it's hard for young people to buy houses. They end up buying very small apartments, or very far, or that are not built correctly/safely (or all of the above). Our rent legislation is very scarce and people do not trust each other so we have people with empty apartments that won't sell/rent them, we have old people in a 2/3 bedroom apartment although they could easily live in a one bedroom apartment (it would be easier for them too to take care of it), that won't move because \"I've been living here since x years\". We had comunism until 30 years ago and our parents got jobs automatically (you were not allowed to stay at home otherwise you were put in jail) and also got apartments very cheap from our government and could pay a very low installment at a very low interest rate. Our average net salary is 625 \u20ac and a decent apartament (zone+size) begins at 60.000 \u20ac. So... yeah. Problem is we have an owner complex + lack of trust between owner and renter makes us want to own apartments from a very young age otherwise you are seen as a loser at life (our parents pressure us with this too, because for them it is normal - and was extremely easy - to own an apartament). So many end up buying very shitty apartments (and most importantly unsafe because of corruption in this domain) around/less 60000\u20ac (we have a government program for this) just so we can say we \"live in our own home\".

            "A big factor here is the urbanification of the modern world.  A much higher percentage of people choose to work and live in major cities and even so called \"mega cities\".  This in turn drives up property values in those areas.  Even worse many of those cities no longer have a local real estate market and instead now have a *global* real estate market.  A good example is New York, San Francisco, LA, most of Hawaii, London, etc.  All those places have a *global* real estate market and now joe average has to compete with Bloomberg, Bezos and every other rich person for the limited housing.  \n\nSo a combo of real estate for investment, local real estate becoming global real estate, increased population and increased demand in the largest urban areas are all to blame.\n\nA good example of a place where it doesn't happen nearly as badly is a 3rd tier city (honestly can't think of another name lol).  I live near Cincinnati Ohio.  I have a 3 bedroom 2000ish sq foot ranch on roughly an acre of land.  It cost 172,000 12-13 years ago and is worth maybe 180-190k now.  You could certainly get a similar house for 200k in the area.  Its about a 15-20 minute drive from city center and even has bus access just a mile or so from the house.  Its in a very safe neighborhood with virtually zero crime (neighbor is a police officer and looked it up.  Only 2-3 non-domestic crimes in the past 15+ years and all minor).  We have excellent hospitals and high quality doctors and medical care.   Heck, there is a brand new MRI machine at the local clinic a couple miles from my house!\n\nWages in the area are not depressed at all and someone with trade skills can easily make 40-60k per year and with a *market useful* degree can earn 60-100k by their early 30s.  (I'm excluding degrees that are not market useful because you should know these things before you invest 4+ years of your life and money into one).\n\nBut no one really aspires to move to Cincinnati ohio.  No one who is rich buys up property in the city so they can hang out with the elites.  So it will likely never be a mega city (and I'm perfectly fine with that).\n\nI mean, even back in the post war years in the USA it wasn't common for single people to own their own home.

            "I know this will get buried and you probably won\u2019t see this, but I did this same thing for a friend of mine in the mid to late 90\u2019s. There was a long period of rain that was rare for where we lived and I noticed that he looked cold and miserable and his shoes were just absolutely destroyed. I knew him and his family well enough that they didn\u2019t have the funds to afford new shoes or clothes whenever they needed or wanted them. I figured out a way to ask what size shoes he wore so it wasn\u2019t weird or obvious. \n\nThat day after school I drove to the local department store and bought a pair of shoes that I could afford with my $4.75/hr minimum wage fast food salary, I think they were like $25 on sale or something but were in the style I knew he would like and most importantly comfortable. He worked with his older brother after school learning how to weld so I drove to their workplace, walked inside where his backpack was just sitting on the office floor (empty and separate from the main floor where all the real work was happening) and stuffed them inside with a quick note saying something like \u201cI finally saved enough money to get you your birthday present from last month, hope you like them.\u201d\n\nThe next day our group met up at our spot in the quad for first break and he had them on and told me in front of all our friends \u201cThanks man\u201d. Later on when we were away from the others he told me he knew it wasn\u2019t a belated birthday present and that he and his mom were very appreciative and said something like how that is something only a true friend would do. \n\nI moved away a long time ago and haven\u2019t seen him for a little over 20 years now. Still glad I was able to do that for him and hope he is doing okay. \n\nLike many others have said... don\u2019t make it a public spectacle. Gift them to your friend in a private or anonymous way.",
            "I know you probably already got your answer- as it's an incredibly thoughtful thing to do. I was that kid who always had shoes falling apart because I couldn't afford them and all I ever got was made fun of for it. I feel like if you pulled him aside, and just explained to him that you're only trying to help him out and gave him the shoes privately, he would recieve it positively. If I was in his position I would be really grateful you went out of your way like that to help and I would appreciate that you acknowledged that I was just a person in need and not the butt of a joke.\n\nI hope that you know that you're a very compassionate person.

            "I was very poor growing up and went to a high school in the extremely affluent side of town. One of my classmates who I barely knew (she was in one of my classes but didn't sit anywhere near me) used to give me brand new shoes and sometimes clothes that she'd bought in the wrong size, gotten as a gift and already had one or that \"just don't fit her right\" so she'd ask if I wanted them, since \"nobody else wears our size\" (we were both tall). After offering the first few times, she just started bringing a paper bag to school sometimes and would hand it to me after class. I was always stoked and felt so lucky that I wore the same size as this super nice rich girl who was so picky about the fit of her shoes. She even gave me a GORGEOUS fancy designer dress \"her cousin gave her\" but \"the color didn't work for her complexion\"... right before a big school dance.

There's no way she just 'didn't like it'!!!!\" I flat-out thanked her for watching out for me all those years and for helping me fit in at that school. She told me her mother and her had secretly \"adopted me\" and that she spent more time shopping for a dress to give me than she did on her own dress for that dance. \n\nSo yeah, don't be afraid to help a classmate.

            "I managed a pawnshop for quite some time and have been to conventions and stuff in the industry so I have met new and old pawnbrokers. Many times when a new shop opens, the owner has stockpiled some inventory from things like estate sales, storage units, yard sales, stuff like that. Items that get sold to a pawnshop typically have a holding period where the police can run numbers to make sure something is not stolen, and then it can be put out for sale. Our state was 3 days. Once that stuff comes out, then it will add to the inventory. The pawned items would have so long initially, we were 30 days with a 30 day grace so 60 days before they became our property. If paid on, they extended time to another month, payments could be made as long as someone needed. After the no payment time hits, those items went out for sale. I can likely answer any question on the industry if you have anything else needed answered. We tried to give fair values on stuff when I worked there and had a very good stream of customers because of it. I believe we were the only shop in the area with a 5 star rating with lots of reviews",

            "My parents were pawn brokers when I was growing up, they had 4 different stores in the 80s and 90s when we moved to a new place to live and I basically grew up inside a pawnshop.\n\nThere are really a few ways to start a pawnshop. You can buy a shop that already exists because the owner is looking to sell, if you are opening a 2nd location you transfer some of your good inventory to the new shop or if you are starting from scratch you collect items, jewelry and merchandise prior to opening a new shop. Either way, it requires a fair amount of capital to get started since you will be loaning money to your customers.\n\nBut, pawnshops make their money from pawns. Our pawn inventory dwarfed the amount of items we sold in the store. Generally, when we bought merchandise or a pawn was not paid for, we had connections to sell them to a buyer directly (usually a dealer of some sort - jewelry, instruments, etc). We also went to a lot of shows, flea markets and events to build connections in the area. We had regular customers who were looking for certain items and built relationships with them so they would come back. Our stores were always highly rated and people trusted us.",

            "So I work in a sort of pawn shop and have helped set up a newly opened shop and had to go through exactly this. The thing with pawn shops is that generally, they don't make much money from selling items. Sale figures are aimed at covering overheads. We rate  our success on how much money we give out, because the more we give out, the more potential we have to get it back. \n\nWe charge a max of 30% + the original price (that's actually cheap) and give them an option to buy the item back or renew it for 30 days charging just the 30% holding fee. (This is tax free money, so pure profit)\n\nNow onto your question. As I said before, sales aren't that important, there are so many taxes around sales, however if someone buys something from us, the best thing they can do for us is to sell it back to us so, generally we try and keep the shop stocked. When we opened my boss already had some other shops so some of the stock he essentially bought off of himself but some of it came from places like Amazon returns pallets or companies that refurbish electronics or ebay sellers, mixed with a few brand new items which he has suppliers for. \n\nLong answer, but I thought it better to understand why having an empty shop isn't great, but that sales are not the be all and end all",
            "The pawnshops that ive worked at a long time ago would move inventory around the cities so people wouldn\u2019t recognize stolen goods.\n\nAlso, whenever they opened a new store they usually transferred junk from other stores for temp inventory.  7 days after item was bought they would bring it out, 90 days for expired pawn loans.

Pawnbrokers associations provide a strong network for support upon start-up.\n\nA franchised pawnbroker (H&T for example) will already have a network accessible to them for this.\n\nEdit: just to add, in some cases these stock will be sold at a similar cost paid. They are essentially for window dressing, to attract people into the store initially and so the store gets a reputation for sellig desirable products from day one. This in turn leads to customers who buy, eventually also selling / pawning.",

At first we sold that stuff on eBay but eventually we had enough to somewhat fill up our entire space. Since we weren't using a large chunk of the building's space anyway, it kinda worked out perfectly. But if one were to start a fully stocked pawsnshop from day one I can assure you they would need one heck of an initial startup fund. It takes a lot of liquid cash just to operate loans daily, let alone buy initial inventory.

Before opening I had driven around the surrounding states hitting up pawn shops. When I found a store that had a large amount of a certain inventory (too many TVs, or guitars, or movies, etc) and would negotiate a good deal if I bought a bunch of that inventory and paid cash. \n\nWith that said, it's not a great way to stock a store, so the inventory was low when we opened.

Their biggest capital investment was a big safe which they upgraded to a vault a decade later. They also ended up using a big section of the house for storage of quirky items such as phonographs, tvs or typewriters etc. and some  musical instruments every now and then. I remember seeing a harpsichord one time that they ended keeping because the contract term had ended. Between the 80s to the 90s they also accepted bicycles, mountain bikes and BMX bikes.

In many cases devs tone down the enemies so that the player can feel good about themselves and the game can be fair.\n\nThe devs of The Last Of Us mentioned that in an early build, the enemy would sneak tactically behind you and kill you before you had a chance to react. This mechanic was dropped because it wasn't fun and felt unfair.\n\nEdit: [Relevant clip of last of us dev talking about this.](https://youtu.be/yH5MgEbBOps?t=100) The last of us documentary is really cool if you're interested in learning on how games are made in a AAA company!",
            "I think it really depends on what games you\u2019re playing now. Many games nowadays have very complex AI using a variety of techniques such as machine learning, nav-meshes, etc. that cannot even be compared to the AI of the 90s/00s.\n\nSome games however still use very basic AI that use the same core principles as that of the 90s/00s, e.g. very basic conditional instructions or even rubber-banding. \n\n*Edit: I\u2019m aware that navmeshes aren\u2019t new, neither is machine learning, nor most concepts.

            "Hey, hope u r still checking this thread. \n\nLike u/sahge_ wrote, the ai in general hasn\u2019t changed much is not because we aren\u2019t capable of making good to straight up unbeatable ai, it\u2019s more because as a player, it would be very unfun to play against opponents who do every single thing absolutely perfectly.\n\nAs such, game devs give ai a set of instruction to follow instead, so that players have a sense of satisfaction when they manage to bypass the ai, as if they\u2019ve cracked the code to the matrix.\n\nThere\u2019s a youtube channel that makes really good videos about game design philosophy and video game evolutions. I got my points from [this](https://youtu.be/9bbhJi0NBkk) video if u wanna check it out. Sounds like I\u2019m repping my own shit but i can only wish i can make shit like this",
            "I'm going to disagree with some of the commenters here:\n\nThe reason why AI tech for gameplaying has only advanced little is that making good AI (smart tactical and fair) is 1. Expensive 2. hard 3. Scales badly, 4. Doesn't really ship more games and 5. With the exception of stuff like chess algos more computation doesn't really help.\n\nIt's expensive because modern AI still involves coding responses to given scenarios. There was some advances in genetic algorithms in the 00s but it never really panned out.\n\nIt's hard because it takes a lot of time to turn hard coded instructions into natural movement patterns and having AIs use just enough info to be smart but no so much to be cheap is a hard balance. Some games are really good at generalizing and can make this easier but unlike most other algos devs are often starting from very little for each game. \n\nIt scales badly because each thing you add in a game, say gun type, adds a whole set of interactions that the AI either has to not interact with or interact with all existing objects with. It's also often hard to have multiple less skilled people coding AI, like you can with art assets, because it's so quirky.\n\nAnd it doesn't ship more games, with a couple exceptions,  such as alien isolation, fear and AI wars. Better AI doesn't matter, you can't show it in a trailer, and with a few exceptions players don't notice. Far cry 3 had way shittier AI than 2 bur few recognize that fact.\n\nAnd last it's still basically look up tables and some fast pathing algos so having a better computer doesn't do all that much, the decision trees are usually pretty shallow.\n\nBut, this is changing, with the rise of Reinforcement learning (especially deep RL), it's slowly becoming possible to let AI train itself. These algos are still pretty expensive so it's unlikely an AI is going to learn from each player (yet), but AIs can and will get more realistic and responsive and tricky in the nearish future. Unity even has these algos built in, so they are getting easier to deploy.",
            "I don't think that's true.\n\nEven if your impression were to be correct, new games are much more technically challenging for an AI - worlds are more detailed and complex, with many more moving objects, so path-finding, lines-of-sight and spatial awareness (all core concepts of game AIs) are much harder to compute than before.\n\nPhysics has gotten more realistic, so AI movement becomes considerably more complex.\n\nBut the real reason is that good AI is only as challenging to the player as the developer feels it needs to be. It would be fairly easy to program an unbeatable AI even without it having to cheat (i.e. having access to information and ressources a player in its stead wouldn't have). The goal is making an AI exactly strong enough to make it fun to play against.\n\nOh, and, presumably you've gotten more experienced and have become a better player. So what works for most players might be too easy for you.",
            "You kind chose a bad example with starcraft. Adduming you mean the original releases and not any of the updates we've had over the years it relied heavily on being granted extra resources to keep up with the player, had poor pathfinding and stuck to a few basic strategies normally relying on outproducing the player. Other RTS games had similar crutches like a. i.  that could see through the fog of war.\n\nModern RTS a.i. has far better pathfinding and can keep up without the use of cheats. If you don't believe me get aoe2 definitive edition and set up an a.i. game between the modern a. i. and the original one. It's a night and day difference even at lower difficulties.",
            "They aren\u2019t if you compare older ai and newer ai you will see a big difference",
            "The A.I. in MGS Phantom Pain is a massive step up from the PSX era MGS games. They\u2019re some of my favorite A.I. in gaming.\n\nThere was (idk if it still does) a far cry game where if you were sneaking around a lot they\u2019d get Night vision and be more cautious, but if you played more agro \u201cguns blazing\u201d they\u2019d get more body armor and better guns. (I think it was 2 or 3). There\u2019s a few games that do that kinda thing nowadays.\n\nFor racing games iRacing just added A.I. last year and it\u2019s honestly the most phenomenal ~~racing~~ video game opponent A.I. I\u2019ve ever seen. I do a bunch of sim racing and nothing comes close. You can tune the A.I. for skill and stuff. They make mistakes, and they react to other cars coming onto their racing line. Compared to games like asseto and rFactor where the A.I. all just drive in a line like ducklings iRacing feels *alive.\n\nThen look at games like left 4 dead and rim world where there\u2019s a director A.I. adding insane kinds of replay-ability. It\u2019ll try to *almost* kill you so you feel like you overcome a huge challenge, instead of just killing you really fast because in video games computer outmatch humans like Mike Tyson vs a Tyson chicken breast.\n\nShooter A.I. is prolly some of the hardest tho tbf, like you can add all sorts of novel behavior like in MGS or my second paragraph but it rarely feels human. I think part of it is companies want to make money of selling online games so there\u2019s not a lot of incentive to R&D really groundbreaking A.I. I\u2019m sure some indie dev will remedy it as the computing power gets cheaper + our A.I. software improves.",
            "There are various factors that play into this, but ultimately it comes down to cost-efficiency. Most video game problems are (in terms of solving by an AI) either *too fucking easy* (hitting someone in the head from across the map) or *really fucking hard* (building an efficient economy and effective army and commanding it), and for many games, this means that game-AI developers either have to *very deliberately* introduce errors to the AI (if the problem is too easy) or solve an incredibly difficult and generalized problem with tons of rule interactions OR both at the same time (Example 3D shooters: Hitting someone is utterly trivial, strategical positioning on the map is incredibly hard).\n\nBut getting back to cost-efficiency: AI developers have a reputation among the AI-research community of always using primitive tech (hard coded state machines are still, often, state of the art in game dev, and AI research left that tech behind thirty or forty years ago) and this reputation is in fact *entirely deserved*, but it leaves out the reasons: Current day AI is... fragile to say the least, it needs to be kept closely monitored and controlled to not go haywire (and just to be clear I don't mean \"Skynet\" haywire, I mean \"why does this broken thing keep predicting impossible horseshit\" haywire), starting an AI project promises *nothing*, you can spend months or years analyzing data and crafting a perfect solution and *still* end up with nothing usable.\n\nAnd that is poison as far as game developer's *bosses* are concerned, unpredictable costs for unpredictable results, in the 90's and early 2000's game developers actually tried to branch out and use more (at the time) modern AI techniques, and the results were mediocre to say the least and sometimes flat-out doomed the releases, and that was the end of that.\n\nNow to be sure, game AI *has* moved forward, but only slowly and incrementally and more in solving sub-tasks (for example, if a modern game ends up with AI that runs into walls, you can pretty much guarantee that the AI dev was incompetent and not up to date. the AI might be otherwise stupid through no fault of the dev, but it should absolutely NOT run into walls these days), but big leaps are too unpredictable for the fundamentally monetarily-motivated companies that guide development here, who (rightfully) don't expect a big ROI for better AI, but who instead want their dev cycles to be done on schedule.",
            "Doing a good AI is difficult, expensive to develop and may or may not contribute to sales. Even if a good AI does contribute to sales, that's also very difficult to quantify. So it shouldn't be too surprising that more of them aren't better. It's actually a little surprising (to me anyway) that there as many decent ones out there as there are.",
            "AI has gotten a lot better. Maybe you don't remember the old games, but their AI was trash (albeit good for their time). \n\nI remember joking with my friend about how dumb the enemies in Goldeneye were. They were dumb as shit. They'd stare at empty walls when not on alert. Even when alerted, they'd stand out in the open and shoot at you. No taking cover or anything, they'd just stand there waiting to die. \n\nThese days, most enemies have some form of tactics and will take cover. More advanced games even utilize flanking maneuvers. And even in games where they're not alerted to your presence, they don't just stare blankly at a wall; there's usually some patrolling going on. \n\nThere's also lots of shitty AI in worse made games that was even dumber than Goldeneye and you don't see that as much these days (although they don't usually make shitty movie tie-in games anymore).",
            "Basically because while people CLAIM they want better AI they hate it when they encounter it.\n\nIt's perfectly within our ability to make AI that works as a team, tries to flank you, makes good use of cover and terrain, uses grenades and other abilities effectively, and so on.\n\nAnd then the players get slaughtered and hate it.\n\nEvery game that has introduced better AI has gotten massive feedback against it and fewer sales. So they stored doing it. Now people gripe about the bad AI but buy it.\n\nAnd, really, when you think about your typical single player game the PC is vastly outnumbered. The only way the player has a chance is if the AI is dumb as a bag of hammers. It makes people feel heroic and powerful to mow down hordes of bad guys, which requires really stupid bad guys.",
            "IMO, many here in the comments are missing the point.\n\nEveryone is mentioning about that making the AI harder != fun, BECAUSE it would be unbeatable. The thing is that absolutely noone wants unbeatable ai.\n\nIts about creating an ai to make it hard, but also challenging and beatable, without giving the feeling of having an unfair fight.\n\nWorst ai are in stuff like CoD, where they aimbot you out and just concentrate on you, while your mates are still horrible.\n\nOr even worse is in Watch Dogs, where the enemy simply do way more damage, while you still need 20 shots to kill someone while shooting at his unprotected head and then call it \"realistic difficulty\".\n\nGood AI I can remember of was 1) Indycar series, which if I remember correctly was challenging, but often driving in head-to-head races. AI's difficulty changed depending how you were performing (Im sure I read that somewhere but can't find it anywhere)\n\n2) NFS Pro Street: This game has a fixed AI difficulty in career mode, which changes it to a harder one the more you progress. It has no rubberbanding and the AI is depending of the car they were driving. They had no advantages. Many remember it for having it really easy Boss races, but because of the car the Boss was driving.\nI actually am creating a mod for Pro Street, that changes it difficulty, as well as their behaviour to its maximum. By doing so I noticed, that they actually use the full potential of the car they are driving, instead of beeing dumbed down so the Player can always win. \n\nSo if everyone gets to drive the same car, it sure is going to be very challenging, but imo fair.\nGonna use this comment to give a [showcase here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feGzo5VNoi8)",
            "Well for strategy games the AI hasn't improved much because there is no reason to improve it, even the Civ 1 AI is pretty much on-par with the current one because they already mastered it.\n\nAnd Half-Life didn't even have challenging AI, just bullet sponge enemies. I hated playing HL, all it did was make me play Blood or Shadow Warrior more, and the AI in both those games was pretty basic. Now compare all that with AI like in say, Far Cry 2, especially during stealth, they search for bodies, chatter with each other, shout false info to confuse you, and always try to flank you or change position while not under fire.",

Basically, you want the AI to only govern general action of the ai controlled entities and then for any set pieces you want those hardcoded by the devs (to some degree) for finer tuning. So have the AI know how to use cover but have the DEVS manually set up an event for them to appear behind cover on a flank. Generally this gets the best rating from test audiences. Now there WILL BE players who really enjoy a more advanced and challenging AI but games targeting just them are doing extra work to narrow their audience.",

            "Hey there friend - not sure if I'm too late to this thread for you to see this or not, but I had the exact same question when I took a few game development courses in college and it comes down to 2 main reasons\n\n1. The relationship between better AI and a better end user experience is not linear. It's more of a logarithmic curve, with severe diminishing returns as the AI gets better and better. Part of this is due to the fact that computers are good at different things than humans are. If you consider an RTS like starcraft for instance, it would be relatively easy to write an AI that could multitask well enough to manage macro-economy stuff almost perfectly. And you could turn that proficiency up and down until the player has a similar winrate as they do against players in their own level - but the actual game play experience would be much different than playing against humans because humans don't have perfect macro - they have advantages in other areas. Which leads to #2...\n2. Because humans and computers excel at different things, it becomes extremely expensive (i.e. time consuming) to try to craft an AI that will not only be challenging, but challenging in the same way that a human opponent would be. And when you have product managers on these projects who are pushing for more features, better graphics, a quicker release schedule, etc. - trying to allocate resources to improve the AI - which has been shown to not make a huge difference in the overall community response to the game - is an uphill battle that is usually lost.",
            "You can watch \u201cHigh score\u201d on Netflix. They talk about something similar to this topic on the first or second episode. Really cool doc. As well.",
            "Single player opponent AIs aren't high on any company's list to funnel more money in and develop. \n\nThat's because what we already have is mostly sufficient for the story mode. Also, the general access and performance of online multiplayer makes advanced AIs for replayability redundant; plus, human players are more profitable.",
            "I think we're looking for the wrong advancements in AI.  There were extremely good bots even back in the days of the first Quake and devs can implement hyper-efficient player-killers in modern day titles if they so choose, it just then becomes exponentially more difficult to balance player power and maintain mainstream appeal.\n\nTruly, though, the advances in AI aren't needed in terms of PvE direct confrontation, but rather in terms of branching decision-making and \"fuzzy logic\" organic emulation.\n\nI don't think it's really enough anymore just to play against AI that is smart-difficult.  We need smart-lifelike.  It's much more intriguing to see game AI behave in ways that are organic and unexpected (and not necessarily in an antagonistic way).\n\nI followed the Storybricks company for a while because they seemed to be of a similar mind and they were working on changing up how PvE works in MMOs.  Unfortunately, Sony Online and Everquest totally collapsed and I don't know if any of their ideas are being worked on anymore.  The core aspect of their approach was to provide a framework of needs/goals/agendas/wants to all NPCs in the gameworld.  So instead of \"Orcs attack human city because that's just what Orcs do and what players expect so that's how they're scripted\", it is \"Orcs attack human city because they have hoarded the resources the Orcs need and the Orcs have the strength in numbers and an already disfavorable disposition toward that specific city\".  Or, potentially even \"Orcs would have attacked human city, but human city wiped out an even more hated enemy of the Orcs which has made them non-hostile toward human city\".\n\nIn a small way, some of the \"fuzzy logic\" AI can be seen in games like The Forest, where the cannibals are indeed extremely hostile, but not ignorant of the player's actions toward them and don't always pursue a confrontation to the death or sometimes choose not to at all.  It's that unpredictability and lifelike behavior that we need to see more of IMO.",
            "Well also you're comparing the AI today to Half-Life. HL was by FAR the best video game AI around for years and years. It was so ahead of it's time. A lot of games are still just not doing it right, the way Valve does.",
            "There's two aspects to look at: \"better\" AI in terms of performance, and better AI in terms of fun to play.\n\nPerformance-wise, AI has improved, partly due to better hardware, but also better optimizations. An example of this is pathfinding, where agents would bump into obstacles first before making it to a destination. We can now afford to feed in more data to the bot more often. The flip side is that while the possible inputs have grown, so have the outputs as well. Games are a lot more complex. Fps is no longer just running around until you find people to shoot.\n\nFun to play is something very difficult to tune. In the old days when AI was more primitive, we would let AI \"cheat\" by allowing to see through walls. You could tune how far a bot can see to scale difficulty, but at the end of the day it still feels unfair when a bot beelines for you, yet turning this off completely reveals how primitive the original bot was.\n\nTuning these parameters to mimic player skill is difficult because it is highly subjective, and what may be a difficult opponent for me may be easy for you. Play testing against bots is impossible to be exhaustive due to time and budget constraints. Eventually someone will find a blind spot or some strategy that will completely break the emersion.",

            "A little late to the party here, but figured I'd add a comment that addresses some of this.\n\nAlso hi, I'm the creator of the [\"AI and Games\" YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCov_51F0betb6hJ6Gumxg3Q), some of my videos have been shared in here already - and the GMTK episode on Game AI links to my channel at the end (thanks Mark, gotta cool 1K subs off that).  I saw my Alien Isolation and The Last of Us video linked as I scrolled through, but I've covered everything from Arkham Asylum to F.E.A.R., DOOM, Hitman, The Division, Horizon Zero Dawn, Splinter Cell, Cities Skylines, Total War, Halo (2,3 and Wars 2) and a bunch more I can't remember.  Plus I look at AI research in video games (PCG in Minecraft, AlphaStar, machine learning for Mario levels, Facade etc.).  So yeah, I'm sadly far too opinionated on this issue!\n\nI think it's always important to preface any discussion with how AI in games is meant to be used and the techniques adopted versus artificial intelligence as a whole.  Games aren't interested in crafting efficient, remorseless opponents.  If we were interested in doing that, then many games would simply be unplayable and it would have been a solved issue 20 years ago.  They're designed to be fallible. The likes of OpenAI Five and AlphaStar aren't built with the intent of showcasing good opponents, but rather how AI (specifically Deep Learning) can now solve complex multi-objective real-time problems by solving the same problem a human does the way a human does it.  When I talk about game AI (either on YouTube or with people I am working with) I think about **theatre**.  Of establishing a world that can maintain your engagement within the game.  Creating AI that acts as a performance, rather than an optimal solution to a problem is incredibly difficult and the perils of scale also impact that.\n\nAs a result, game AI has a myriad of techniques that are designed specifically for the purposes of that theatrical performance - and are not really used in any other fields of AI.  AI tools and techniques in games have improved significantly over the past 20 years; addressing numerous issues and challenges that designers require.  But also, games have become increasingly more complex and this increase in scale causes problems.  Having an NPC in a fixed environment in Half-Life is much easier to maintain than say Assassin's Creed Odyssey or Red Dead Redemption 2 (I'll come back to this in a moment).  People often hold F.E.A.R. in high regard (and rightfully so), but that system cannot scale to larger and complex situations.\n\nNumerous techniques have arisen and the community has agreed these are good for specific problems (see Nav Meshes, FSMs, Behaviour Trees, GOAP, HTNs, Utility AI etc.).  But there are so many other issues that there is no agreed solution because the problem is more complex.  This often results in bespoke systems rebuilding the wheel again and again, or some games experiment with an idea (say MCTS, used in Total War and a few other places) and then not used because of issues or a lack of confidence in the method.  Like I say, much of that is a lack of agreement on how to do something (e.g. navigating in air or water, driving, animation pipelines, vision and other NPC senses).  This is of course then bespoke from engine to engine and even the big caretakers (Unity, UE4, Crytek) not only don't agree on what AI tools should exist in the engine (with exception of navigation meshes), but also focus more on rendering and physics technology.\n\nFor many years game AI has suffered a lack of processing capability in games.  Largely because the bulk of CPU and GPU time is dedicated to core gameplay, physics and rendering - not to mention multiplayer (how many games can you name during the peak of Call of Duty that opted towards multiplayer add-ons instead of more focussed story experiences, this does influence $$$ budgets on AI teams).  Plus AI CPU/GPU budgets are often tiny compared to these other areas, because - particularly when you consider how games are marketed - these things sell a game more than others.  Hence game AI often makes crude and/or smart concessions to make something look smarter than it actually is to compensate: the illusion of intelligence is a recurring theme in this space.\n\nTo specifically address your question: it's a mixture of all these points and the aforementioned issues with scale.  As games become larger, more complex, look nicer, sound better, this brings new problems for AI designers/programmers/animators etc. to address.  Often resulting in per-title tweaks/hacks/concessions to deal with the explosion in complexity.  This isn't to say of course that being given more $$$ budget to tackle them would mean they're solvable.  Some of the problems that exist in games are incredibly complicated - this is why you're seeing Google/OpenAI/Microsoft use games as AI testbeds.\n\nRight now Machine Learning (notably Deep Learning) is becoming more useful in games, but it's tackling the mechanical problems (lip-synching, animation controllers, real-time physics, content generation, player analytics) rather than the design problems.  Or they focus very specific design problems that are tightly scoped and easier to maintain (see ANNA in MotoGP or Drivatar in Forza).   Ultimately, ML will have a greater impact as a tool to optimise and improve complex design issues that developers have, rather than just be plugged in to make the core AI behave.\n\nThere is also a larger discussion of what players want from AI in their games.  I've seen that bounce around and I'll leave that to you all to decide.  I think I'm a little too biased these days.\n\nApologies, this is a longer answer than I intended.  But the crux of it is that while AI has improved, so have games and that brings all sorts of new challenges.  I could write a much much longer response, but nobody wants that!",
            "Because AI feels *super* unfair.\n\nPerception is \"bots should be easy, they're just bots\" when in reality, a \"bot\" is a mechanical master of any game, only tempered by whatever intentional flaws the devs program.\n\nPeople think it's about making a \"better\" AI, but a \"better AI\" feels like you're getting cheated.\n\nIn reality, they work to make the AI *worse* in a way that feels natural.\n\nFor example, last night I was playing a custom match in League of Legends, playing the new champion Samira against Brand AI (intermediate difficulty, it's the highest.)\n\nThis thing is hitting absolute perfect skillshots constantly at max range, doing things that humans couldn't do.\n\nI know brands cooldown on his Q ability as I play him, and even I was surprised that his ability was back up as quick as it was because the bot is able to cast it *the exact moment* it's ready. And it never misses.\n\nFeels terrible.\n\nIt would have been nice if it had mispositioned occasionally, walked a little *too* far forward to try and hit this skillshot, instead of perfectly hovering tower range, hitting perfect range skillshots in a perfect combo *every* time.",

            "It\u2019s a good point. I\u2019m 30 so I can relate a little. I guess it\u2019s because of multiplayer, back in the days almost nobody had an internet connection so devs would invest more time to develop AIs that could simulate players, because you would have to use them frequently.\n\nAfter broadband and multiplayer became very popular, it has been far less reasonable for a company to invest time and money in developing an advanced AI for a game that is meant to, and will be, played only online with other people. That\u2019s one of the reasons bots became far less common, many of those games ditched them completely.\n\nThat said, I still believe there are plenty of good AIs implemented in games like FEAR, Alien Isolation, Horizon Zero Dawn, etc. In single player games I can confirm to have seen consistent improvement in AIs over time, as they usually invest more on that aspect.\n\nI can recommend you a YouTube channel that goes deeper into AI and games, well, it\u2019s called \u201cAI and Games\u201d and they show great examples of AIs both older and modern: https://www.youtube.com/c/AIGamesSeries",

            "Incremental improvements maybe?",
            "Posted this elsewhere in the thread but I'll put it as a top-level comment as well.\n\nThe trick with AI is that, they're not going to ever be as \"smart\" as you given the same information that you normally have. They're also not looking at a screen like you do to gather information about what's around them, they have direct access to anything the programmer gives them. They could be on the other side of the map and still know your exact position, which way you're facing, how much health you have, what weapons you have and how much ammo, everything. So if you give the AI too much information they can end up being too deadly and no fun to play against. If you give them too little information, since they're not actually intelligent they won't be able to do much with it. Usually there's a middle ground somewhere in between, where you give them some information that the player wouldn't normally have, like information about the map in some areas around the corners they couldn't \"see\" yet, and hints about which direction they might want to go so that they'll eventually find the player instead of wandering around aimlessly. Then when they find you you have to make sure they don't have perfect accuracy, because humans don't either and you want them to seem realistic. You need them to take time to reload, or take time to aim before firing. All of this has to be programmed into them, and it takes time to do this, and there are a lot of different variables involved that require fine tuning to feel right. Some games do this better than others.\n\nThen there are diminishing returns on how much work we want to put into the realism of a game. A game company could spend a lot of adding more physics realism to games, better simulating what bots could see, simulating audio physics to determine what the bots could hear, spending time making the bots do things that humans need to do. For example a lot of bots never run out of ammo like the player does, usually because they're short-lived, so bots in many games do not need to pick up ammo like a player does, they also won't pick up health packs. Sure that would make them more realistic but often the player wouldn't even notice, or would be mad that the bot took those items from the map that they might need. If you look at games where bots have different threat levels, that go up if they detect the player, often you'll have groups of bots so that if one bot spots you the rest of the bots in the area are alerted and start looking around. And even if you kill a few of those bots and leave their bodies scattered in plain sight the other bots within a minute or so will go back to normal as if nothing happened. Game developers know this isn't realistic, but know that players will get frustrated if the bots are on alert for literally hours like real people would be. Also the developers know that they can't make the bots realistic enough to start doing a proper search of the area like real people would, so it's easier to just make the bots go back to their normal state.\n\nSomething else to consider if that a lot of AI, especially when physics calculation get involved, could start to consume a lot of CPU time, and players are constantly demanding better graphics, so many games try to use very little time on the CPU side to give the GPU most of the frame time to render the scene.\n\nFinally, even given everything I've said so far, it comes down to the fact that we just don't know how to make computers intelligent yet, so everything the bots are doing has to be programmed by a programmer, and possibly tweaked by designers. The bots aren't going to learn anything beyond what they were programmed to learn, they will not adapt (beyond what they're taught to adapt to). Humans will learn and their behavior will change, different humans will act much different so they're unpredictable, whereas most AI bots all use the same code with minor variations maybe based on the type of bot they are. Someday when we can make learning computers and do so efficiently then that kind of thing might be tied into bots in a game and they may end up with unique behaviors, be less predictable, and better adapt to their environment like a human would.\n\nSource: Game programmer",

One reason that AI feels no smarter than the AI of your childhood is that we're really bad at looking at something and figuring out if there's intelligence behind it.\n\nBack in 1999, Brian Moriarty gave a lecture on AI at GDC called [Who Buried Paul?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQLoRUS-ypM). It's a 62 minute long lecture, and almost every single minute of it is devoted to explaining the conspiracy theory that Paul McCartney (bassist of the Beatles) was killed in 1966 and replaced by a lookalike. At the end of the lecture, he links the conspiracy talk back to game design and AI by saying that you don't need to spend an eternity and a fortune making AI that actually thinks like a human because if you just make it act a little random, we players will leap to attribute intelligence to it.\n\nNow Mr. Moriarty loves the sound of his own voice, and I don't automatically think he's a genius of game design just because he's spent so much in the industry. But he does make a good point. As a player, the only thing you get to see is the output. Reverse engineering it from \"the enemy did X\" to \"the enemy must have been thinking X\" is fraught with the same baseless assumptions that people made when they saw a license plate on an album cover that says \"28IF\" and sincerely believed it to be a deliberate message that \"Paul would be *28, IF* he were still alive\".\n\nYet at the same time, we consume games in a much different way than kids did in the 90s. On top of the fact that it's not weird to spend 1000+ hours playing a game, it's not weird to watch other people play a game even more than you play it yourself. And people scour games for detailed information on how it works in order to fill a wiki or to develop a speedrun strategy. The strategy of \"just fudge it and it'll look intelligent enough\" couldn't possibly stand up to the level of scrutiny that we subject games to nowadays.",

The AI is just going to mop the floor with you. But that is not fun. We want to have a chance to win, but an expert AI will always be better than you, because it has simply trained a lot longer. It will have played over a million games and thus knows every single movement frame and hitbox size. What we want is a game where we can actually win, so any AI must be dumbed down, so that we gamers have a chance. The hardest mode should be beatable if you have played the game long enough, maybe not for a casual with 1hour a week, but for guy that plays at least 7hours a week.\nHow do you limit an AI, well you can let it not train enough, but you never know how good it actually is going to be. So instead of going for a deep neural network, you hard code limits and stops and tactics.

AI would need to be coded to learn and learn and learn from every mistake they make and every success you make, every time the game progresses in order for it to be a real challenge, and by then you would have probably already beat the game.",

About a month later I got a letter from the bank saying that they were very sorry for their mistake and that when I had withdrawn \u00a360 at that time on that date, the machine had shorted me by \u00a310 and only given me 50 pounds and that they had credited the \"missing\" \u00a310 to my current account. \n\nI have no idea what that was about but thought that if that's what they were saying and they wanted to give me a tenner then I wasn't going to complain.

            "Ok, so here's what to expect from an ex ATM technician, who also took phone calls directly related to these types of issues.\n\nATMs can be programmed to put out specific denominations, based on what you're telling me, it's counting the money correctly.  Most likely what happened is you didn't notice someone left 30 dollars in the drop box, anything left in the hold out tray would've been sucked back into the machine (Depending on model).  So treat it as you would if you found $30 on the ground.\n\nI'll edit this comment with further details on other possible scenarios that I've seen, and how they play out but I'm 99% confident this is all you need.\n\nEdit 1:  Now there's also the human error element.  ATMs are loaded by humans some times, or even just owned by one (You can buy an ATM if you want).  It's entirely possible that human put a 20 in where a 10 should've been, and made a mistake themselves.  The ATM counts # of bills coming from X cassette.  X cassette is set to 10s, and a few 20s spit out, it's going to think it's spit out all 10s, because it does not validate cash that is outgoing to customers, it just counts it very thoroughly.\n\nEdit 2: Following the above edit, it's possible to configure a cassette wrong, and in that case you would've seen something similar, where even your second withdrawal comes out giving extra cash.  In these situations, eventually the banks catch on, and will properly debit the correct amount of money from your account (Most of the time) basically retroactively \"Fixing,\" the issue.\n\nEdit 3 (And I think final edit): Flip the script, you didn't get all your money what do you do!  DO NOT PANIC.  ATMs are programmed to auto fix the issue, but have to DEPOSIT the money back in your bank account, depending on processors and times, that can be instant, but legally can take up to 3 business days.  This is still a computerized process, errors occur, a network outage happens at the same time and your bank never gets the message.\n\nIn this scenario, a Regulation E dispute is in order, and to simplify, a Regulation E will state your side of the story, and it's up to the owner/operator of the ATM to PROVE you got your money from the machine, not the other way around (So you need no receipt).  Apply that to your above scenario, unless they can prove that they mixed a 20 in where 10s should be, they'd have to prove it.  It's easier to prove a cash carrier loading a cassette marked 10s, with 20s, and reverse and fix those transactions than it is to prove someone miscounted their money, and added a 20 in the pile of 10s.",

            "Quick story here that I'm hoping the other comments will bury but I'll get it off my chest:\n\nAbout 10 years back I had just rented a flat and they told me to prepare to pay $800 in bond when I came down to sign. So I withdrew the $800 in cash, (which was a lot of money for me, hell it still is) but when I got to the real estate office they told me they didn't have cash facilities and I would have to pay with direct deposit. \n\nI freaked a little because I was 22 and how the heck do you put money back into a bank account without going into the branch? At the time I was working during bank hours and there was no 'ducking out to go to the bank' as I worked at a call centre and on a strict work contract. No time off. \n\nI asked family/friends what to do and they told me I had to find a deposit ATM and that it's really easy! You just hit deposit instead of withdrawal, it will spit out an envelope, you put the money in and pop it back in the ATM, no worries at all! \n\nSo I did just that. I was holding this $800 in cash in my sweaty hand, terrified at any moment I would lose it or the wind would pick up and take it from me. I got to the ATM, pressed deposit, it asked me to scan my card and select the account and I did so.\n\nHow much was I depositing? I typed in $800. \n\nConfirmed. Payment method?\n\nI selected cheque, OH NO! I meant to press cash! FRICK. CRAP. \n\nI tried to press cancel, nothing. \n\nI tried to back out of it. Nothing. \n\nThe only option was to let it spit out the envelope. \n\nOnce it did there was an option to go back and complete another transaction. I crumpled the envelope up in my left hand and shoved it in a pocket while I went back to do this properly this time. \n\nWent through the whole thing again. This time I selected cash. It spit out the envelope. I put the money in and put It back in the machine. Done!\n\nExcellent. Here's a receipt for my transaction. \n\n.....\n\n$1600? No...no I deposited $800... oh crap they think I submitted both a cheque and cash! Argh that's gonna be a pain! No time to worry about it now. Gotta get that bond paid. \n\nI had work and then moving and life stuff to organise so I forgot about it for a few days and then I checked my bank and remembered. I'd paid the bond so there was just an extra $800 just sitting there. \n\nI asked family and friends and they assured me that the bank would realise their mistake and fix it when they reconciled everything. That it might take a while but not to spend ANY of that money in the meantime. \n\nAnd I didn't....at first. \n\nFor a month or so I didn't touch it, but then I fell short of being able to pay a phone bill due in 3 days, but pay day was in 5 days. So I crossed my fingers and paid it with part of what I now called the \"fake eight hundred\". As soon as I got paid I put the money back and thought \"no harm done\". \n\n3 months later it was like having an interest free overdraft. Where I needed I would borrow from the fake eight hundred and then put it back on pay day. \n\nI mentioned this in passing to a friend and she looked at me incredulously and said: \n\n\"You know if they haven't figured it out in 3 months they are never going to fix it right?\"\n\n\nI would love to say I then put the money to great use but I'm fairly sure all I did was buy a haircut and then clothes and outings, luxury stuff for me at the time.\n\nThey never realised and I changed banks years ago.\n\nI still wonder how they never noticed.",

            "I unfortunately have experience in this area.\n\nUltimately it depends on the size of the sausage and the individual anatomy of the person.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the journey from mouth to bum, there are a few narrow points (sphincters) that need to be traversed. The first tight one is at the joint between the stomach and the small intestine, called the pylorus. This is where very large items get stuck, and others take time to pass. In my experience, anything that can be swallowed can pass through. For example small objects like razor blades generally pass straight through. Pens and highlighters, dinner forks (surprisingly common item to swallow for prisoners!) and other similar items pass eventually but sometimes do become lodged and require retrieval. The problem for the sausage is the length - it needs to be oriented properly to slide through otherwise it'll just sit in the stomach until his plastic protector breaks down  and he is digested.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf our sausage succeeds on passing on, the next barrier is after 4-5 meters of small bowel - the ileocecal valve. This can be extremely tight in some people and is the most likely place for an obstruction to occur. This would result in the proximal small bowel becoming larger and larger - and may result in a perforation (i.e. the bowel can't take the pressure build up and tears!). Some people aren't quite as tight and so the sausage could proceed to the large bowel. If it has made it this far, it is likely to come right out the other end!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's a dangerous game to play, and the prize isn't great. I would suggest you start small and work up from there.",

The pyloric sphincter (that's the lower end of your stomach) or \n2. The ileocecal valve (valve at the end od your small bowel)\n\nAccording to the paper, objects longer than 5 cm will also not get swept by duodenal movement. The duodenum is c shaped with some hard turns. It is divided into 4 parts; the short first segment is roughly 5 cm, the second 7.5, the third 10. So if your sausage is long, it might cause some obstruction. \n\nEither way, if your sausage is about, or larger than 2x5 cm, you may have difficulty passing it out. But if it somehow gets pass all that obstacles and the condom retains its integrity, you will have yourself a nice warm sausage.\n\nAt any rate, if you do this experiment, dont do it to yourself or you will most likely have to see your doctor real soon.",

The two hormones compete for the fight or faint response.  It all depends on your genes and how you were raised with dealing with stress.
