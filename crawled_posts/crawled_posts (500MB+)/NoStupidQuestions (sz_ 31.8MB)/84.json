            "First, consider asymmetrical as \u201cdefault\u201d. This is why our insides are asymmetrical. Our outsides evolved to be symmetrical for a number of reasons, the main one being movement. Walking, swimming, and flying are all much easier if we have symmetrical bodies.\n\nEdit: I interpreted the \u201cour bodies\u201d part of the question as referring to all creatures with symmetrical bodies, not just humans. The fact that I can fly is not relevant. My answer was also specifically referring to evolution. And by \u201cdefault\u201d I meant that if symmetry will start as asymmetry, slowly changing through some evolutionary benefit.",
            "Relatively speaking our internal organs ARE symmetrical.  \n\n\nThe internal organs we have that come in pairs are symmetrical on either side of our bodies, kidneys, lungs, testicles/ovaries, much of the  lymphatic system, even the right and left lobes of our brains. Distal organ placement (one on each side of the body) are the way they are for a few reasons. The most simple being a: having more than one is a good thing in case one is damaged, and b: it better balances the weight.  \n\n\nEven our internal organs that aren't obviously symmetrical are pretty symmetrical. Skeletal system, skin, circulatory system organs, etc.  \n\n\nOne could consider the digestive tract to be the most asymmetrical organ system, but even that is pretty symmetrical considering it's essentially a tube.  \n\n\nNow how does this translate to external symmetry?  \n\n\nThe human skeleton is symmetrical. Symmetry balances weight so that we can stand erect. Attached to that is the start of our muscular system, symmetrical serves to provide support and mobility for the body and so on moving outward.  \n\n\nOrgans that tend to not be symmetrical are the ones we only have one of and aren't located centrally in our bodies. Those organs are shaped and placed the way they are because of evolution essentially. Their shape essentially lets them do their jobs as efficiently as they can.  \n\n\nSo if we know that much of our internal organs are symmetrical it follows that our exterior would also be symmetrical.  \n\n\nNow sometimes organisms have evolved with major differences to their symmetry, the fiddler crab comes to mind. That's because that those asymmetric traits were randomly selected over countless generations and persist because they gave an inherent advantage to those organisms.  \n\n\n**TL:DR - Essentially we are internally symmetrical, the organs that aren't are shaped and placed because it helps them do their job as efficiently as they can, be it because of shape, space/location, etc.**",

            "Natural selection.  People prefer symmetrical faces and bodies.  This makes them more attractive to mates, thus humans have evolved to be mostly symmetrical on the outside.  Being that people haven't been able to see the insides of their potential mates until relatively recently, this wasn't part of their selection process and the survivors were people whose innards functioned rather than those whose innards were pretty.",
            "I think if you think about functions external to your body, like things you do with the body onto the world, (think about all the things you can do with movement, coordination, and your senses) it makes more sense for those pieces of anatomy to have evolved symmetrically. Think about the fact that our eyes work together from symmetrical vantage points to allow us to look far out into different directions, or the way the brain can efficiently and effectively coordinate movement between two symmetrical halves of the body so we can generate our own momentum and manipulate the world around us with great precision. \n\nWhereas the cells that would evolve to become our organs weren't obviously intended for these purposes. Them growing symmetrically may not benefit they're functional designs, or the design of our anatomy as a whole. I'm not a scientist but there are probably evolutionary and physics  reasons for things being placed where they are.",

            "A great question!\n\nBtw we do have a lot of symmetrical internal organs (lungs, kidneys, gonads, basically all of our vasculature). Asymmetrical organs include the GI tract. \n\nBut I guess our organs usually have a job they want to accomplish. They start with substance A and make it into substance B. We need more specialized structures and asymmetrical structures because these organs have different jobs at different regions. If things we're symmetrical, then, conceptually, they wouldn't progress/be altered. \n\nI think you may be focusing on the GI tract, which is just one long tube. If you sliced it down the middle, most of it is actually symmetrical, its just stuffed into our stomachs in a strange order. Lemme know if that helps.... or if it just doesnt make sense!",
            "I get that external bilateral symmetry is considered more attractive, but I question if this was a driving force in the evolution of many species.  My first thought was that even sightless species tend to be bilateral.\n\n\n\n",

            "Symmetry looks pleasing, it helps us pick a mate ",
            "I have seen this asked before and the general consensus was this:\n\nOn the outside, you have the muscles and limbs that control your balance. It is easiest to have things symmetrical since symmetrical things are easier to balance. Internally, nothing's really moving around, so it just gets packed in there as efficiently as possible (but the weight is still more or less distributed evenly)",
            "Well, outside of inner torso, our insides are very symmetrical. A lot of it comes down to function. Certain shapes are more conducive to specific function and evolved over time as such. For example, the small and large intestine are shaped rather differently, but for only slightly different functions. Another factor would be the necessity of 2 organs vs 1 organ. If we had 2 of everything, it would likely end up symmetrical based on how pretty much everything we have 2 of is more or less symmetrical. Kidneys are on the fairly equidistant from the midline, etc. \n\nOn the subject of 1 vs 2 for symmetry, our lungs are asymmetrical because our heart is also stored within our rib cage, so we have 2 things that would otherwise most likely be symmetrical but for the 1 thing taking up space. \n\nThe question you may have now would be, \"Well then, why do we not have 2 of everything?\" In my opinion, it comes down to energy consumption vs efficacy. Does it help to have 2? In terms of evolution, if it did, we would have them. Why don't we have 2 livers? Outside of alcoholics (and other substance abusers) and some folks with rare disease, it would just contribute to a lot of energy consumption without any net gain. \n\nSo, that's my hypothesis. \n\nI'm in dental school, but we take Gross anatomy (with cadaver lab), physiology, path, etc. Sorry I don't have any sources to cite. Just pulling from memory from classes. ",
            "Let's use a suitcase as a comparison. You have a fixed amount of space to introduce a bunch of objects with different shapes and sizes and, for the sake of simplicity, same density.\nSure, you'll try to keep some kind of symetry while stuffing the suitcase, but at some point this giant ass shoe doesn't fit, and how and where do you place this several-feet/meter long rope symetrically? So you compromise symetry and A E S T H E T I C S just to put the essentials inside.\nNow let's put a handle on it. You don't want it to flop everytime you push or pull the handle right? Then you need to put it \"in line\" (idk how to translate this from spanish, just guessing) with the center of mass, which is located in the axis of symetry.\nWhat about the wheels? You could use just one in the middle, but it would be pretty unstable without someone balancing it all the time, you should add more. Where? In opposite but symetrical places, you dum-dum!\nAnd that's why you are symetrical on the outside, but asymetrical on the inside.",
            "It's to save space, and because symmetry makes organisation so much easier.\n\nOriginally most animals are bilaterally symmetrical, meaning the have two \"opposite\", but equal halves - like your hands. For many animals, this holds true even for the insides.  \nSymmetry is important as it makes it possible to specialise body parts and to have a consistent growing pattern. Whitout symmetry, this is not really possible, as with plants, the leaves cannot specialise, since the always pop up in random places on the plants body. However, tissues in the leaf are organised (more or less) symmetrically and thus also s more specialised.\n\nsymmetrical parents produce symmetrical offspring that is much more similar to them than it would be the case int asymmetrical parents (think plants. they look similar, but the placement of organs is very unique to each plant). That means that selection can act over generations on the arrangement of body parts, in the way it cant in plants (and sponges, one of the few primarily asymmetrical animals). This brought the specialisation in appendages in arthropodes, where an ancestor with unspecialised appendages (similar to a water milipede without its mouth parts) evolved into crustaceans, with tail limbs, swimming legs, gills, walking legs, shears, antennae, and 3-7 different pairs of mouth appendages.   \n\n\nIn vertebrate evolution, we started out as fish. Some fish are symmetrical even on the inside, but mostly, unpaired organs start to shift to one side or another, to save space, especially if animal adapts a weird body shape to fit a certain way of life (think like a flat fish, or an eel). Originally, the unpaired organs were above or below the intestine, which meant the animals needed relatively high bodies to accomodate everything. If things moved to the side, it made it easier to pack things in a more spmherical/flat. way The most noticeable organ to do that are the liver, the pancreas and the spleen. And especially because pancreas and the spleen develop in a nook and  on a bend of the intestine, the intestine start to fold asymmetrically too. Also, apparently the best way to fit a long tube into a small cavity is just to let it fold in by itself, there is not many ways to do it better, and all are much more difficult than just letting coincidence coil the tube. So when energy needs increased and the intestine got longer it just randomly made folds in the space it had.  \nThe lungs are asymmetric because the cardiovascular system is. Cardiovascular system is asymmetric because vertebrates rammed additional arteries into lungs ( i say additional, because there already were, all jawed vertebrates have probably had lungs in their phylogenetic history, but some (sharks) lost them, and some (most bony fish) repurposed them into swim bladders, while other bony fish still have functional lungs (lungfish, gars, and polypterus)) when they  went from water to land. That also meant the loss of gills and repurposing of gill arteries and so on. The the heart had to divide it self into two, to separate the oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, and one the part of the heart that pumps blood through the whole body has to be bigger than the heart that just pups to lungs.  So heart is asymmetrical too, and shifted to that side, and displaced lungs and caused them to be assymetrical too.  \n",

I\u2019ll simplify things quite a bit so it won\u2019t be perfectly accurate but close enough. \n\nWhen we\u2019re a growing bundle of cells, we need to go from a single cell to complicated being. The first step is to form a disk of cells. Next, that disk folds into a tube like folding paper into a cylinder. See how the outside is symmetrical? That\u2019s why the outside of our bodies is symmetrical because it develops from there. \n\nThe inside gets a bit more complicated. The inner tube twists, pops outside the cylinder for a bit, twists again, buds off little bits that become other organs, and is in general a lot more chaotic than the general structure of the outside of the body. This twisting is the reason your organs have a specific side and aren\u2019t symmetrical.",

Based on there being no reason, nor advantage to have perfect internal symmetry in your body, the internal organs, specifically the unilateral ones (liver, intestines, spleen, pancreas) will arrange themselves based on the order and speed they grow at, while the bilateral organs (lungs, kidneys) will be symmetrical. \n\nExternally though, there is a significant functional advantage to being symmetrical.

            "If you have a large enough (preferrably parabolic) mirror its perfectly feasible.\n\nOf course putting such stuff so far away takes time, not to mention that it needs to be made out of unobtanium or have active supports (in a fashion similar to orbital rings) to prevent it from collapsing in on itself due to its own gravity.\n\nOr you can have some utterly mad syntgetic array telescopes - on the multiple solar system scale, and use the light bending around a preexisting (acceetion disk free) blacknhole to look back in time.",

            "I think this is an easier way to understand it?\nSee it as you have thrown a ball out 1 year ago (light that produces images 1 year ago in this analogy), and now is planning to send a wall into space (the mirror) to have it bounce back to earth. It is already out there further away from the wall you are sending, so it is impossible.",
            "Answer: Ignoring all of the practicality problems, yes, but the furthest in the past you could see is 1 year before the mirror was placed there. And unless the mirror appears there by magic, it would take longer than one year to put the mirror in place, so there is no way to see further into the past than when the ship or whatever starts taking the mirror to that point. If the mirror is already in place and has been there for over two years, yes, you could see 2 years into the past from the moment you look at it.\n\nThis is ignoring a lot of astrophysics, practicality problems, and a whole lot of other shit that will affect how far you could look into the past and if it would even work. But in the case of a hypothetical, yes it would work.",

            "Equivalently and more practical is to have a relay of emitters/lenses across a light year (similar to satellite relays) that refocuses light to diminish the effects of dimming due to inverse square law.\n\nAssuming the latency is 2 years and you're able to focus your images light to each relay, yes you can see your image as it as 2 years ago.\n\nIts not that impressive because you can do the same thing with your phone's camera by recording. Its just a matter of latency. Here latency with your phone means how long did you wait before viewing the recording.",
            "Theoretically?  Sure\n\nPractically?  Nah",
            "If you just suddenly spawned the mirror 1 lightyear away and looked at it from Earth, you'd have to wait one year to see the actual mirror, and it would look one year prior to its spawning. So yes: If you'd spawn it now (2019) you'd only be able to use it next year (2020) and see two years ago then (2018).",

If you spend a lot of time in your bed or near it you may subconsciously relate that time with work/play instead of rest. I've experienced it myself since I can pass out in a couple minutes on my couch, not so much in my bed. I think that is part of the recommendation to have an office space/separate area from your bedroom and to use your bedroom for rest.

            "Perhaps its something very few people think about. Overdoing the timing and the ritual of going to bed might actually make it to stressful to sleep like that for some people.

            "I would say - without being an expert - that it all depends on how the nap and bedtime fall within your sleep/awake cycle. I know sleep cycles vary from one person to the other, but there seems to be an accepted average of 3hours for a full cycle. I would imagine something similar applies to wake hours - you have cycles of higher energy vs lower energy. (So if you tried to take a nap at midday for instance, maybe it wouldn\u2019t be as easy as around 3pm ...)\n\nThat would be a possible explanation - no claim to scientific basis, just my personal inferences.\n\nAnother explanation is that people usually take naps after lunch, supposedly when digestion is going on, which supposedly lowers your general energy levels. Again, no scientific basis.",

            "I think it's two-fold.\n\nFirst - People generally go take a nap because they're tired. A nap is, normally, taken outside of your schedule because you feel as though you can't stay awake any longer. You lay down with the express purpose of sleeping.\n\nSecond - When people go to bed, they're not necessarily tired. They go to bed because it's part of their daily schedule in hopes of going to sleep early enough to wake up to begin the next day's schedule. Since they're not tired, they end up doing other stuff like reading or using their phone or tablet. The blue light emitted by electronic devices have been shown to keep your brain active which goes against your attempts to fall asleep, thus, making it harder to do so.\n\nOne way to counter this is by using a filter on your phone or tablet. Personally, I use the Twilight app. It gives your screen a warm, red/orange hue that doesn't excite your brain and keep it working in overdrive. Prior to using it, I could read several dozen pages before falling asleep. Once I started using it, I have trouble reading more than a couple of chapters in a book (around ten to twenty pages) and have fallen asleep with the tablet still in my hands.",

            "People have already mentioned the feedback loops and immediate rewards of video games, so I'll add to that by saying that you are having fun. Video games, books, projects of any sort that you find intrinsic value in or feel rewarded by are a lot easier to sink your time into than things you simply don't enjoy even if there is incentive down the line.",
            "Because the video game is actually giving you rewards and praise.\n\nWhat praise do you get when you achieve something in real life?",
            "\nVideo Games can give you a reward you deem more enjoyable than real life activities. Spending a night grinding for a new level is a set amount of work with a predictable and set reward. Spending a whole weekend by yourself miserable and studying for an exam may or may not lead you to a good grade, which way or may not even help you in the long run. The work is less predictable and the reward is less assured.",

            "Certainty. Video games reliably and consistently reward you for your work. Life is a long series of shitty gambles. \n\nIn an RPG or strategy game especially, there is an expectation that all actions are will result in some kind of forward momentum. Regular effort will absolutely lead to growth. I kill 10 giant rats, I get better at swinging a sword. I do a favor for the prince, his relationship meter goes up, and I am that much closer to getting my own duchy.\n\nIn real life, doing a bunch of work doesn't guarantee anything. People are way too chaotic and unpredictable to behave like reliable video game characters. And even on an individual level, your efforts may be for naught. Repetition is not always a guarantee of skill. Effort does not equal growth. Economies are lop-sided and non-sensical. The physical universe is complicated to the point of incomprehensibility. Nothing fucking *works* in reality. Nothing is *clear*. There are no way-points or quest markers or progress-tracking bars.\n\nFor me at least, video games are a break from the terror, the frustration, and the constant tragedy of living in a random, cruel, unforgiving universe with no apparent rules.",

Getting the same level of recognition in a professional or personal sense requires you to not only accomplish \\[things x\\], but to be able to share that you've accomplished that and have others recognize that accomplishment and award it accordingly.\n\nGames are just you and the system (even if there are other players, it's mediated through the game's accomplishment parameters).

Your mind labels activities into a connection of immediate worth to your ego. It's basically because you've developed the choice as a bad habit and it's a self-discipline issue. \n\nIn one way, it's due to how your ego has rectified dealing with feeling bad about something, e.g. not progressing as much as others. Video games solve this by causing a small drip of neurotransmitters(like dopamine) based on whatever activities are in the game. Real life tasks generally don't offer a drip of feel good neurotransmitters etc, and instead offer you those good feelings only after a long investment, and based on your life experience, you might even have developed a subconscious negative outlook on working hard, if you've worked hard and it didn't result in anything worthwhile, like working hard at a job and not being commended for it.\n\nGenerally people seem to value things in the present more than what they could get in the future. So that present enjoyment from a game beats the potential enjoyment from doing well in a test. The problem with this habit, is that after years of avoiding hard work and relying on the same fix for feeling good, you'll stop enjoying games and distraction media in general and probably slip into depression over the regret of having not spent time wisely investing in your real life goals.\n\nOne way to get out of the bad habit, is to list all your enjoyments, and make a conscious decision to only partake in them when you've achieved some type of work that day. It's cliche that its the work hard play hard idea, but otherwise the only other way I see is requiring another person to control your daily activities to instill discipline.",

Complete a long term goal, you get a bigger cookie.\n\nLife doesnt always pay dividends and you may not have enough short term goals to pat yourself on the back about to pad out the time it takes to complete your long term goals. And sometimes all those goals amount to nothing and there is no cookie at the end of the line.\n\nThe lesson here should be that you need to set realistic long term *and* short term goals for yourself and when you succeed you need to give your own self a pat on the back and a small cookie as reward, even if nobody else on Earth gives a shit, you need to give a shit.\n\nLife is an RPG where small quests can take days or months and the major story arc quests take place over years and decades. Be patient, and seek out goals and treat yourself for getting them done.",

It\u2019s a habit. It\u2019s a default that you\u2019re always able to do, are comfortable with, and yes, gives you that sweet sweet dopamine.\n\nA good way to get around this is to start doing things that are hands on.

            "At least one aspect is that video games are much better designed to reward you for things you do with levels, achievements, progress, etc. They have carefully crafted skill/difficulty curves, and are usually well tested prior to you playing.\n\nMeanwhile, at your job, tasks vary randomly in difficulty, and rewards are routinely delayed by days or weeks. Days can routinely end with you tired, and the most common thing at the end of a day of work is needing to do something else (pick up the kids, make dinner, etc)",

            "Still haven't gotten the hang of this, but it so far is the best sounding advice I've gotten asking this same question.  Think about what does and has made you happy--and then take away the specific context, and go about achieving a goal you set by building the things that make you happy into the plan to achieve the goal.  You are \"willing\" to do the work in video games because you dont hate the work.\nThis probably won't be the best video game analogy but hopefully it gets the idea across. Let's say you favorite thing about playing a video game is finishing the game. Well, before you get there, you get a lot of mini victories on the way by beating the levels. Aside from the awesome cut screen after beating a level, after a level is beaten you get a fresh new level revealed and woosh! You are riding the high of being so clever you beat the last level and with a whole new set of problems in the next level that you *just about* have the newly acquired skills to feel both clever and challenged and by golly motivated to play \"just one more try for tonight\" and lose track of the next 4 hours.\nIf you take the parts of that that you loved enough that you forgot time was passing, and you want to set a goal of losing weight, you'd set your target weight as the goal (beat the game), set intermediate goals in between (levels) But Not just \"every 5 pounds I lose I can call it a level!\". Think back to your video game levels...each probably requires you to unlock a new skill/tool. Some levels you breeze through, some levels take you days. So your interm weight loss 'levels' will probably serve you best if they are more like \"for 7 days I'm going to not eat carbs\". For that 7 days, your mission is to navigate your life while also searching for new non-carbs, ways to cook non-carbs new ways, etc. On day 8 you beat your level 1 have some new skills in non-carb. Level 2 could then be no carbs + walk 30 minutes a day. Now you are semi settled into at least paying attention to what you are eating, and are picking up skills on how to make 30 minutes of time a day for exercise--7 days of a goal, try 7 different times of day. Try different places. How do you feel after each day? What worked, what didnt each day. By day 8, you've beaten level 2 and now are getting at least in the habit of thinking about what you are eating and making time to do some exercise.\nRinse and repeat.\nYou'll pretty quickly start to notice you are moving toward beating the game...but since the challenges keep changing every time to get to your next level, you need to for at least the duration of the level not really pay much mind to the big goal and really get into what you are doing in the level you are on.\n\nAgain, probably a terrible analogy. But the moral is, figure out what makes you tick and then try to hack your life to build as much of it into how you are living as you can.  We have a lot more power to control how we go about doing things than we think we do, and very few things in life are tailor designed for our personal preferences.  It's up to you to know what your preferences are and then get creative in plugging them into to every possible place in your life. Your favorite thing is hiking but you live in the city? Find the commute to work with the most staircases. Take 5 minutes one night to explore a new route that has a really big staircase or the staircase Rocky climbs on the movie and then take that one one time that week. Leave for work an hour earlier and take a round about way past places you havent before. You love Thai food you say? Find three routes that take you by Thai places you've never tried before.  \n\nIf you do it right, the boring easy first levels will still have enough \"well look at that!\" moments that you still get through them, and will set you up for the harder later levels where you start feeling pretty badass for beating them. When you reach your end goal you'll be elated--and looking for the next game you want to beat :)",

We learned how to balance a checkbook, finance a car (we researched what car to get and if we wanted to lease or buy,) do taxes, play the stock market, etc. The tax thing was fun because turbo tax was brand new and my teachers had never heard of filing online before so they tried it out with my taxes. I think it was a great class and I'm disappointed other high schools don't offer this type of class.",

            "I mean I think it just depends on the school. I didn\u2019t go to a nice school but they still offered a personal financing course, which most people took as an alternative to geometry or algebra 2 or something, I can\u2019t remember. Anyways, that course didn\u2019t teach everything but it was good for teaching us about credit, loans, taxes, the economy, etc.",
            "This thread is old now so this comment will get buried, but a NYS Certified teacher I have the answer.\n\nSchool is not about learning things, in fact most of the things you learn are completely irrelevant to a normal person's life. What schools IS for is learning SKILLS, and you practice those skills by learning things. Some examples are:\n\nLearning how to learn\n\nProblem solving skills\n\nCritical Thinking\n\nWork ethic\n\nTime management (getting assignments done, getting to class on time)\n\nCollaboration\n\nSocialization \n\nPersonal management\n\nOpening the mind to new perspectives\n\nThese are just some examples. A school setting teaches you all kinds of things that you are not aware of, but most people only take away what is on the surface, and are led to think that memorizing the quadratic formula is what's really important (it's not and it doesn't matter). This is why there are a lot of students who get sick of school and don't try because they \"don't need to know this\" which while that is true, by not trying they are forfeiting the opportunity to learn and practice all of the above mentioned skills. This is also why some kids who do really well in high school end up having a really hard time in college, because in hs they were smart enough to get good grades without really working, so then they get to college where the material is much more difficult and they don't know HOW to work.\n\n This idea becomes lost on students, and I think that is due a lack of communication between teachers and students about WHY the students are doing what they are doing. This concept can even be lost on many teachers, and that may be due to many different factories, such as lapses in training, or different philosophical teaching ideologies. \n\nThis is why education in the arts and music is INCREDIBLY important, not because you need to know how to play the cello, but because you are practicing all those above mentioned skills in an environment that is completely different from a normal classroom setting. \n\nTo answer your question, school isn't supposed to teach you things, it's supposed to teach you HOW to do things. If successful, you have all the skills required to quite easily figure out how to do your own taxes (especially since they're really not that hard)\n\nI hope this burried comment finds you and answers your questions.\n\nEDIT: I don't mean to disparage all educational topics, some are good to know! (\"Those who do not know history are doomed to repeat it\" etc etc)\n\nEDIT: America is a huge country and obviously this cannot describe every school in it. Teaching philosophies and goals will vary from teacher to teacher, state to state, etc. \n\nAs a teacher, you need to be able to create and adopt your own teaching philosophy. This is what I believe, and this is what I tell students who ask the same question (a shorter version)\n\nEDIT: Okay the ACTUAL reason is because stuff like that is not included in the state mandated curriculum and will not be touched in in state standardized testing. that's a whooooole nother conversation, but this is my reasoning for things like this.",

            "They do. Have you filled out a worksheet in school? Then you can do taxes. \n\nSchool should teach how to learn, not how to do specific things. The whole purpose is to say \"let me google taxes, let me read the instructions, let me see if I can figure it out.\"\n\nAlso taxes are really not that hard. If you can't figure them out, there are people you can pay to do them. The stakes are low. There are so, so many more important things to teach than that specific thing. However, if a teacher wants to teach taxes as a way to teach students how to read paperwork and figure it out, that would be great.",

Our final big project was to pretend to move out of our parents\u2019 house, with no high school diploma.

            "Story time, about 5-6 years ago there was a class at my old highschool that was called \"Business Math\".\n\nThis class counted towards HS math credit, I personally took it for EC credit for two semesters junior year cause I already did 2 years of woodshop and wasn't interested in HomeEc.\n\nThe class went over things like budgeting, taxes(state/federal), balancing a checkbook, a few politics subject, and other topics. We also watched video clips of TV shows that was related(ex. Family Guy's \"Freaking FCC song\"). A memorable budget example we did was have a budget of X dollars per month and try to balance rent, utilities, bills, food, and misc. I remember the whole class in the library going to Tmobile/Verizon/AT&T and getting mobile phone plan quotes so we can compare different levels of services and prices between all of them for our budget. Really made us feel like adults and we could grasp how serious a budget can be.\n\nThe class, unfortunately, was catered to the \"at risk\" students. So, lots of underachievers, wannabe gangsters, rejects, etc. I actually enjoyed the class so much that in my second semester junior year, I TA'd for the class. So I would have my class in 2nd period, then TA for 4th period. I ended up getting a 102% by the end of the second semester, which it was an easy class, but I've never gotten close to 100% in a class let alone going over 100% lol.\n\nSadly about a year or so after I graduated they got rid of that class in favor of more Geometry and Algebra classes, which hey cool, but that was literally the only class that taught personal finance. Our Economics class that was required only went over country/global economics.\n\nSo yeah, very disappointed with my old highschool.",

Public education should offer \u201cpractical courses,\u201d and some do, however, the current state of public education is less concerned with students learning to file taxes than students passing standardized tests to demonstrate minimum competency in their required subjects.\n\nDoes this mean that all schools only want to teach what is required at the bare minimum and nothing else? No, but the test scores have become an agreed-upon metric to determine teacher performance and, consequently, funding and program development. It is far from the schools\u2019 fault that students can only engage in classes x, y and z with few options, those classes have to fit a number of criteria to meet regulations and standards to keep public funding. Many of these courses are designed with the expectation that every student will go to higher education after high school, which is simply not true nor practical. \n\nCombine that with the rampant anti-education agenda to cut taxes, prioritize military spending, favor charter school programs and discredit educators and you get school systems that aren\u2019t willing to stick their necks out and deviate from what they are required to do. They\u2019re under-appreciated, under-funded and constantly told that they are to blame for the lack of parents\u2019 initiative to raise their kid and foster their learning at home. \n\nA public program cannot raise a child nor provide them with all of the practical programs that will benefit them in their adult life. I am happy that some schools do offer more \u201creal-life\u201d courses, especially when the costs of higher education are astronomical compared to previous generations and we cannot delude ourselves into believing that college is right for every high school graduate.

Seeing as how most countries at the moment encourage people to live in big central cities, driver's licenses for everybody is not as important as good public transportation.\n\nI do agree with you that school should prepare a person for real life, but disagree with your two examples. I believe doing laundry, replacing a button, basic computer skills, and dealing with health emergencies and natural disasters, are more universal examples. Unfortunately, school has become a training camp for competition to get into college/university. What would your parents say if you missed your opportunity because you didn't know CPR or mixed whites with colors?\n\nWe could divide courses into two categories: Graded and not graded, or taken into account for college/university and not. In every country the latter has been implemented, courses that don't count for college/university are being treated like second-grade courses. Subsequently, students either have bad grades, or their good grades are not representative of what they actually learned.\n\nEducation is walking on a fine line between teaching work skills and other life skills, and as long as work is #1 in life, nothing will change.",

Senior year i had a friend be my roommate and it was the best time ever, but she did an internship elsewhere and i got another roommate, a transfer i didn't know. It was the worst! She had her mom call her every morning to wake her up, she did voice calls all the time so I could not concentrate during my busy senior year. My only saving grace was that she went home every weekend and during breaks. Honestly.. you'll get through it!

I\u2019m super private, and really dreaded sharing a room my freshman year, but I got used to it pretty quickly. She had a work-study job, and I had early classes, so normally we\u2019d both have the room to ourselves for a few hours a day. When she left after a few months, the room suddenly felt way too quiet and empty.\n\nAlso\u2014many colleges do provide larger suites and apartments, usually for upperclassmen/higher prices. It depends on the school, but the standard shoebox dorm room you see in movies is usually reserved for freshmen/people who get unlucky in housing lotteries.\n\nAlso also, meant to say, my biggest problem with dorm life wasn\u2019t actually sharing a room but sharing a bathroom with 20 other girls.

I think people often try to make the best of something but fail to express their concerns to a stranger (my roommate could have clarified that laundry on my side of the dorm made her uncomfortable or late-night door-shutting woke her up).

It wasn't as though we ever banned each other from sleeping in his own bed.\n\nI will say, especially at large universities, more and more people just bail on on-campus housing after freshman year.

I was lucky enough to not have a roommate for a couple semesters and those were the best points in my time at college.\n\nI never ran into the \"sock on the door\" thing, but if I ever needed private time with my SO, we just used his car.",
            "I lived in a tiny, tiny dorm room with a roommate at boarding school. I'm talking maybe 12ft by 20ft. And... yeah, you just get used to having zero privacy. You coordinate times when one of you is out of the room. I also had a loft bed, and I put a curtain up over the part under it, so I could hang out over there. \n\nthe first year, my roommate was my best friend, so i didnt mind. Second year, I fucking hated my roommate, but she was an extrovert and was rarely in the room. She did however make late night phone calls to her mother and I almost strangled her for that.",

            "As an older person who shared a room with siblings when I was younger, and then had a roommate in the same room for 2 years in college, I think it's a good thing for people to experience. It gives you some perspective on how not to act like an entitled asshole when you do wind up having to share a room on occasion later in life.",
            "I had to live like that for nearly 3 years with 3 people, you absolutely have no freedom in this kind of scenario, you can't leave your things out because you know they will be touched or used without consent. \n\nYou have no control over sleep, I was the only one in the room who didn't know the other people from my hometown, the other two knew each other, every time I'd try to sleep they'd keep the lights on and music on with the excuse of studying and when I had to do late night projects they'd want to sleep early and turn off all lights. It was a mess.\n\nAlong with that a lot of arguments and fights over space.\n\nAs soon as I got out of there, I promised myself to never be in that kind of arrangement again and I have been hella happy with my life, I lived in a really shabby and bad place because it was the only single room arrangement I could do, but I lived there just to not have to share a room with others.",
            "I've had to share a room before and it was one of the most disgusting, unpleasant experiences ever. My roommate didn't respect my privacy (it was a flatshare, not a dorm) and she had gone through my things at *least* once.\n\nAs a result, I was barely \"home\". I got more privacy hanging out at friends' places. I generally disliked our room anyway but she honestly wasn't the most hygienic person so it was even worse... she was kind of a loner so she never had anyone over, and I was too embarrassed by our room/apartment to ever bring someone over.\n\nPrivate time alone in the room is whenever the roommate isn't home. If you want to \"have some fun\" by yourself, the bathroom is your kingdom. I've known some people in our situation who literally just have sex while their roommate is asleep 1ft away on a seperate bed... the shared room life is really something.",
            "I spent my entire life sharing a room with someone until I was 23.  When I was a kid and at home with my parents, it was my brother or both brothers.  Then a college dorm room.  I had my own room after college for maybe 2 years or so before I met a girl who became my wife.  I certainly can and did enjoy my own room, but I guess living that way my whole life, it was never difficult.\n\nI think it comes down to mutual respect and understanding from both sides.",
            "We were required to live in dorms my freshman year of college. The thing that helped the most was that my roommate and I sent each other our schedules and would say if we were gonna take a nap or have people over or something. Just communicate with them. It might have been easier because we both were considerate.",
            "If you're normal and your roommate is normal, you eventually just get used to having headphones in for whatever you're doing on your xbox or laptop or phone, and you barely even notice they're there. So much of the college experience is social, and much of that comes from experiences with your roommates/suitemates/housemates. To miss out on that is missing out on much of what college teaches you. In my four year I had 5 direct roommates (1 a year except two in junior year as one was from abroad). I always had fun with them and never really felt like i was in need of privacy. My senior year (this year), my roommate moved out mid first semester and I had a single til corona kicked us off campus, and it was the loneliest, most boring time in my room of all my 4 years.",
            "I did it for a year in college and hated it so much.  But you do kind of get used to it.  Humans can tolerate much worse.",
            "I only lived in a dorm for a year, but it was great. Maybe it's because I was so happy to be away from my parents... My roommate was awesome, my suite mates (2 rooms connected by a bathroom) were pretty cool too. I didn't mind not being alone, but I never had any privacy at home.",
            "Then you would really hate being deployed.",
            "It really depends on your preference. I never want to live alone again. Having roommates makes me feel like my home is full of life. Loneliness is very painful for me, and having roommates takes so much of the loneliness away. I haven't done the dorm life in a minute, but having our own rooms in our house/apartment is great for me. I have been living with roommates and my husband for 4 years and I honestly never want to live without roommates.\n\nThe hassels of navigating chores and house rules gives way to such a rewarding relationship for me. We play lots of bored games together, have movie nights, share meals sometimes, work together on cleaning day, and I absolutely love it. It also helps that I save $600 a month on rent by having roommates.",
            "It's called being fucking poor and not having any other option. I lived in a tiny apartment with 5 other people just to save money. When you split rent and utilities 5 ways it's a lot easier to manage.",

            "I hate to sound like a jerk... But I didn't realize how many people have had lives that they only had their own bedrooms.  As a person that has never not shared a bedroom, and I'm 39, most people don't have the choice because of their economic status. \nThis is truly a 1st World Problem.",
            "Some people are naturally more suited for that than others. I can have the sweetest roommates you can imagine and I go insane after two weeks max. It's not actually anything they do. It's just that my brain will never, ever shut off if there's other people around. There will always be another active stream that handles their presence in my brain. The quality of annoyance feels similar to not being able to sleep.",
            "It has to be someone that does their own thing and is respectful of your space. I had two different roommates in college, one from each side of the spectrum. The good one wore headphones while watching TV or his computer, cleaned up after himself and practiced good hygiene. The other one picked a blister on his foot (in the center of the room, no less) and tacked the piece of skin to his wall. Then, after it dried he ate it. I also caught him watching some pretty nasty shit ON MY FUCKING COMPUTER.",
            "As much as I enjoy my space now, there was a time my entire family shared a room in a shelter. The way I see it, people have that much trouble compromising on space like that because they've always had the luxury of space before. If you've ever been strapped for space like that in your life, you wouldn't complain about what you have, even when you have to share. I once lived with my parents and family in a storage shed. Privacy and space? What's that?  It's a bonus, not a given.\n\nSorry, not trying to shit on your problems.",

            "I think it depends how well you get on with them. My friend shared a room at uni. He was very nervous before moving in because he was about to share a room with a complete stranger for the next year. He arrived before his room mate and sent me a picture of the tiny room that barely fit the two beds, two desks, and two wardrobes. Panic stations. When the guy arrived, they realised that they had a lot in common. Once they no longer shared a room, they didn't stay good friends, but for the duration of sharing a room, they managed to cope - they would watch TV together and if they were doing something on their own, they'd stick headphones on. The only awkward thing he told me about was that they both knew when each other was going to... wrestle the eel. They never spoke about it, but they were clearly both very aware of what was happening. It also made it hard to bring a girl back after a night out.\n\nThat said, he told me about one of his other friends who also shared a room, and he really didn't get on with the guy. They had completely different sleep schedules, different interests and barely spoke to each other.",
            "I live where housing is pretty cheap compared to other states. My boyfriend and I got a two bedroom two bathroom apartment for only $350.00 a month. And we only use the one bedroom and bathroom so we could rent out the other room if we wanted but we don\u2019t. And there\u2019s a local college literally 2 min away. It costs  I think thousands of dollars to live in one room with a stranger for just one semester. That\u2019s such fucking rip off. My boyfriend and I laugh about it all the time. If only people looked around a bit first. You could live with a roommate still but have your own room and share a kitchen etc for significantly cheaper than staying on college campus.",
            "I had my own room my whole life before college and was worried about this exact thing (I\u2019m super super private and somewhat introverted), especially since I had to room blind (didn\u2019t know who my roomie was, college randomly matched us). It actually turned out way better than I expected. My roommate was clean and well-behaved, we both had defined areas of the room and stayed within them. We both weren\u2019t in much so chances are whenever one of us was inside the other wasn\u2019t, so we got a lot of alone time. My only big issue was that she slept at a regular time so every night at like 3 am I had to get ready for bed in the dark. That being said I am getting a single this year, not because having a double was a horrible experience but because I need a space that feels completely mine (and can afford the extra expense this year), which that room didn\u2019t. It\u2019s more a psychological thing than logistical.\nIdk how guys masterbate tho",
            "When you share a room long term the dynamic is very different than when its just a week or two. If its someone you really get along with its an absolute blast. Most people want a certain level of personal space so its usually pretty easy to keep your stuff on \"your side\" of the room and after awhile you end up sharing a lot of things so its not too much of a problem. Its also not as difficult as it seems to get alone time, there will always be large chunks of the day when one of you is in the room and the other its in classes or at work or something. Most of all, when you live with someone for awhile you can just tell when they want to be left alone and you can usually find something to do out of the room.\n\nHowever, there are definitely downsides. your example of the sock on the door is a pretty common one. Usually you are in larger complex with people you make friends with so we can usually let each other know if we are having someone over and we just crash at a friends place for awhile.\n\nI find most things are a matter of familiarity. Before I left for boarding school living with a roommate was kind of intimidating but after about a month it felt normal and even after several years and a bunch of roommates in a bunch of places I can't say the lack of personal space bothers me that much.",
            "I got really lucky with my roommate freshman year. Neither of us had any sleeping conditions or anything like that, we didn't have the exact same schedule so there were times we had only ourselves in the room, and we set up our drawers and desks such that we made a divider between the halves of the room.\n\nSophomore year, me, my roommate from freshman year, and a mutual friend of ours tripled. Dear God, we got shat upon by the school. They essentially gave us a double, but added one of everything for the third person. That year was living in a slide puzzle. On top of that, we had the loudest, most inconsiderate neighbors ever. Luckily, after many complaints to the school, we got a much easier time the next year.\n\nJunior year, we got on the best dorm on campus. The room had air conditioning and heating, a private bathroom instead of a communal one, plenty of space, and the walls were thick enough that neighbors were never an issue.\n\nReally, your experience in a dorm is 100% luck based. Others are certainly right in saying that dorm life is romanticized because it distracts you from the shitty hand you might get dealt. And even if you're fine 3/4s of the time, you're certainly going to remember how much that 1/4 sucked.",

We were in highschool together but were more of acquaintances now found we had to share a tiny room (If we both stretched our arms out from our beds we could probably touch fingers). She's now my best friend. More like a sister actually. I'm thankful for a lot of things, but our friendship is definitely close to the top of that list.",
            "It\u2019s been a decade since I was in a dorm room but it nearly did drive me insane.  \n\nStory time\n\nI actually started out without a roommate. I alerted my RA that my assigned one was a no show. Another girl ended up getting moved to my room which at first I was happy about. My social anxiety was out of control back then. Instead of going out and making new friends.  I would just stay in most of the time playing FarmVille except for meal times with my small group of guys I bonded with because we went to high school together.  \n\nIt was fun at first because she was hyper social and seemingly had no fear.  We got along pretty well and both were night owls so we didn\u2019t have an incompatibility with sleep or anything. Both of us were messy so there wasn\u2019t really any fighting about that.  She would often go out and leave me alone which was nice.  She actually ended up being the reason I met me husband.  But she was drama. She always had something going wrong.  The real beginning of the end was when she got pregnant \u201con accident\u201d and I put that in quotes because it wasn\u2019t on fucking accident. She just had too much faith in her bf of like 4 weeks and thought he would step up.  He wanted her to get an abortion and she begrudgingly agreed. After that she just clung to me. \n\nShe no longer went out an didnt pretty much anything without me. I invited her to dinner with my friend group 1 time and that turned into her coming to all our meals together for the rest of the school year.  \n\nI felt bad for her but at the same time she was creating many of her own problems just by making shitty choices and my patience began to wane. \n\nBy the time the year ended I pretty much never wanted to see her again. \n\nOverall the experience was *something*. I don\u2019t exactly regret it because it really did help me a lot to grow as a person.  But I certainly wouldn\u2019t want to relive it.",
            "I loved sharing a dorm room with my roommate and I met a ton of great friends in the dorm hall. It was actually one of the best experiences I\u2019ve had in life and I would go back in a heartbeat. Having all of my friends in the same building where we could party and study and have fun together was amazing.",
            "I adjusted fine. I grew up having to share a room with siblings sometimes so that probably helped. I found it easier to have a roommate than sharing with siblings. We mostly ignored each other and stuck to our sides of the room. Campus was big enough that if you wanted to be alone you could for a walk on the nature trails and not see people. I went to a small school where freshman had to live in a shared dorm unless you were rich. It was so much the norm I didn't even think to question it.",
            "It's difficult, but not actually as bad as it seems if you have a decent roommate. I'm a major introvert, very social but need my alone time to recharge. Freshman year I had a roommate who I was very close friends with, but she never left the room except to go out with me or to go to class. It was really frustrating sometimes but there are TONS of other places I could go on campus to be alone. I spent a lot of time sitting by myself in quiet areas and it was okay in the end.",

The poor kid in the room beside me got a roommate who I'm pretty sure will pop up in the news at any point after murdering a large group of people.  The kid and I had a system worked out where if he got in trouble he could knock on his wall three times and I'd bring in the cavalry.  Thankfully we never had to use it, but that poor kid suffered his first year for sure.\n\nEvery year after that I paid for a single room.",

            "I lived in a dorm my first year of college and loved my roommate. We shared the same values but had different personalities, which is best case scenario in my opinion. We respected each others space and laid ground rules at the very beginning, none of which were hassles for either of us. Everything went smoothly. I was really lucky considering it was basically luck-of-the-draw and we didn't talk until after room choices were final.\n\nThat being said, not everyone is so lucky. It's not uncommon for roommates, especially female, to steal clothes. I don't know how many people complained that their roommate took their clothes to give to a friend and just played dumb when confronted. A guy who went to high school with my roommate lived in a single dorm room with 8 other people (mind you, the rooms are like 150 sq ft) for months because his roommate was having sex on the guy's bed, bringing guys over and kicking him out in the middle of the night so they could bang. Poor guy finally had enough and just decided living in a tiny room with 5 girls and 2 other guys would be better.\n\nMany people room with friends from high school, but there's like a 40% chance they will end up hating each other. \n\nThe lack of privacy sucks, but it isn't too bad as long as you and your roommate are compatible.",

The only problem I ever had besides the shared bathrooms (2 people each in 3 rooms shared a bathroom) was the people above me that decided to bang so hard at 4am one night I though the wall would fall over (if you're gonna bang in a dorm room please put a pillow between the wall and bed frame, or move the frame well away from the way).",

It\u2019s also useful to have a copy of each other\u2019s class schedules because then you can know for certain when you\u2019ll be able to be alone.

A fun fact is that there actually was a legal case put forward from prisons where they said that it was inhumane that prisoners lived in such small rooms - the defense lawyers then took room measurements from a local college and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not inhumane for you prisoners to live in such a small space!

And you end up with some friends, often for life, that you would never would have met otherwise. \n\nThis is a real benefit of the US on-campus university model. You learn about people and relationships and living on your own.\n\nBut yes, everyone has their own horror story, or just bizarre things that only immature 19 year olds would do.",

            "I had a roommate my first year of college, and while she was nice and polite and quiet and we never fought, I DID spend a considerable amount of time crying in my car because I had nowhere to just sit and decompress on my own so that was fun",
            "In the army my first assignment I was issued a room that was probably 20 feet by 20 feet. The middle of the room had wall lockers separating the beds from each other. I was a 20 year old girl from Southern California and my roommate was an 18 year old from Georgia. We were different in every aspect of life, even including sexuality (I was gay in a hidden LTR, she a very single straight woman who had no issues exploring it) and I stayed in the room for 2 weeks. After my next door neighbor attempted to sell my coke (yes soldiers were wild in the Iraqi War time frame) I moved off post. \n\nWhen I was deployed I shared a trailer (there was 3 rooms in the trailers) room with someone who I was actually friends with. It was fun but at that point I was in a new relationship with a girl I had met in Iraq and she sleeping around with (she admitted) 15 or so men. There was tension and I had to cover for her promiscuous ways multiple times. The most frustrating point was if I had been caught with my girlfriend (whom I dated for most the deployment and years following) I would\u2019ve been kicked out and she only finally got in trouble when she was caught with a married man. \n\nIt\u2019s hard finding things in common with complete strangers but to me, sharing a small space with anyone, strangers or friends, it\u2019s almost destined to fail.

She was an absolute nightmare as we had different sleeping schedules and she was a light sleeper and would become furious if I woke her up before 3 pm. We barely survived it.",
            "I\u2019m an introvert like this, and there are a few things that help. \nThe first is being home when they\u2019re gone and vise versa. We would set our schedules as much as we could so we each got some alone time. \n\nThe second big thing is finding other ways to be alone. I went running or went to eat by myself, studied in the library or outside. Plus, my research in undergrad required me to be alone for several hours in a lab. It\u2019s wasn\u2019t so bad, but I also had a wonderful roommate who ended up being a lifelong friend. I know some people have horror stories.",
            "I live with two roommates and there my 'brothers' for the lack of a better word. Some people are not compatible, we are extremely lucky. My advise is don't risk mental or physical health for some cash. Maybe see out your lease but you are the only person who can change your living situation it's gonna be take a while.",
            "It works best when you don\u2019t spend a lot of time in your room. I had a shared room one year during school and that was enough for me. One Friday I got back from class and was ridiculously horny- couldn\u2019t wait to jerk off. My roommate proceeded to sit down and watch How I Met Your Mother from Friday night straight on through to Sunday night. I was losing my goddamn mind.",
            "Honestly, I felt the exact same way. I was worried when I went to college cause I wanted my own room, own place to go back to and own place to relax. \n\nWhen I got to college, however, my roommate and I got along pretty well and then we started finding lots of similarities between us. We liked the same games, we were both laid back, loved the outdoors and took similar classes. That alone made me get along better with him, and I have to admit I got pretty lucky in that situation. Plus our schedules complimented each other to the point where we would each have at least a few hours if not more of alone time each day. \n\nAnother thing we did was have our room be like two separate rooms, but in the same space if that makes sense. We lofted both our beds and then we each had our own space for (working, playing games, watching movies) underneath. We even considered putting up a curtain across each of the lofted beds so our space underneath the bed would be even more privatized. \n\nIt was honestly a great experience. We even met a really good friend on our flat who we are considering going to a three person room with just so we could all be together and have fun. I went from not wanting any roommates to considering three! \n\nI think it\u2019s a lot different depending on who you get roomed with, but my experience was great!",
            "Lived in a. ~18 foot (6ish meter) by ~8 foot (2.8? Meter) room with another guy in college. Are beds were but a meter from one another and we obviously lived in very tight quarters. How\u2019d it work? We were patient. We always used headphones and studied at our desks on other ends of our little hole. When one wanted to go to bed we tried to let the room get as dark as possible.

I picked a spot in the back corner to allow some segmentation and only one side that faced the rest of the room. On this side I hung a large flag to give me a little bit of privacy. \n\n1a. Also set up the room in a way that nobody\u2019s bed was in the main section, or in other words segmented off our tv/couch so it was in a common area.\n\n2. I found things that got me out of the room, like a girlfriend with her own apartment and a few groups/clubs. Also weed. \n\n3. I tried not to let every little behavioral quirk or frustrating action get to me. Pick your battles, but also don\u2019t be afraid to say something that drives you crazy. For those things where a conflict did arise, used another roommate or someone on our floor to mediate. No joke, we got mediators for bigger conflicts.

Second, I lived in the same room as my brother my whole life, it was actually weird not having someone in the same room. Third, from what i've seen and heard about cultural differences between America and Europe is in how we interact. Apparently, Americans are considerably more prone to interact with a stranger for no good reason. Finally, the biggest reason- money. In college, a single is much more expensive. So, it really depends on personality, but there are some cultural differences here and there.",
            "Communication is key. Need to get freaky with someone? Let your roommate know. Making food? Cook up an extra serving even if they wont eat it. The gesture is not only important but the worst case scenario is having leftovers. Going out? Doesnt matter if they will decline, because again, the gesture matters. Having a dorm mate doesnt need to be a draw back because there is always a middle ground that allows you to coexist peacefully."

            "No, he would not own the painting because of the ideal of certainty in the law and because property interests are extinguished at death.\n\nI *think* your question is well answered by the ideals of certainty, predictability, and finality that are in all legal systems.\n\nOr, it's possible that you are curious about the rights of the dead, especially the property rights of the dead. I'll start here because it's pretty simple. Dead people don't own anything. I am certain this is true in common law systems. When I earned my law degree, I also received a certificate in international and comparative law, and I have studied narrow aspects of this question, such as who owns your body after you die, in multiple legal systems and I am nearly certain that civil law also says that dead people don't own anything. So, if dead people don't own anything, all of da Vinci's property interests in the art work were extinguished when he died. Those interests cannot be reinstated. So, if you were trying to understand the rights of the dead, there's your answer.\n\nLegal systems exist to achieve a few goals, most notably to eliminate the use of violence to resolve private disputes. To achieve those goals, some other ideals must be implemented. Related to your question are the ideals of certainty, predictability, and finality. Certainty is a little vague and has at least a moral justification and an economic justification. \n\nPredictability is a useful feature for a legal system because it helps to deter bad behavior and to promote risk taking behavior that is beneficial to the state, for example, starting a business.\n\nFinality is usually discussed in the context of a dispute settled by a legal process. All parties need the ability to reach a stage in the proceedings at which the state declares, \"For better or for worse, every ruling on every aspect of this dispute is final and may not be relitigated.\" \n\nIn your hypothetical, if da Vinci could claim a property interest in the painting, that would seriously undermine the necessary ideals of certainty, predictability, and finality, so it's nearly certain that da Vinci would not have any property interests in the art work. \n\nI can only think of one set of rights that da Vinci might have under French law: [moral rights](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_rights) related to the artwork.",

That being said, the law does take into account that if someone has owned something for a very long time, especially if it's been generationally owned for hundreds of years, they kind of have a valid claim to it.

            "On Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast, he was interviewing Macaulay Calkin and Mac had a pretty solid opinion on art (I\u2019ll paraphrase since it\u2019s been a while since I watched the video):\n\n\u201cOnce you\u2019ve made your art public, it no longer belongs to you, it belongs to humanity.\u201d\n\nObviously he\u2019s speaking loosely, in terms of morality of art ownership and not from the same standpoint a lawyer, for example, might have on the subject. But admittedly that\u2019s just his opinion, while I agree with it, some of you might not, so take that for what it\u2019s worth.",
            "If he came back to life, we'd either lock him up and do unspeakable medical experiments on him to figure out how that worked, or he'd be king of everything.\n\nIf the second, yes.  He could take possession of that piece.  Or any other.",

            "Why would he *want* to?",
            "He painted it on commission, and it was sold to various parties over the years. He has had no claim to it from the moment he picked up a brush.",

            "The real question though is, who would win in a fight; da Vinci in his prime, or DIO in his prime ?",
            "Was it ever his? Usually those things were commissioned by rich people. So maybe someone hired him to do it and it\u2019s theirs?",
            "Nope if i am not mistaken he sold it to french king for 4k gold",
            "didnt he sell it?",
            "This would create a whole new realm of law, most likely.  It's a new situation, and one that really doesn't have an analogue moral framework.\n\nIf someone dies, and they expected to die as Da Vinci did, they tend to give their things to heirs, beneficiaries, etc.  Those transactions are recognized by and governed in law.  If he did NOT expect to come back (how would they know?), I think it stands that da Vinci would probably be told by a court to \"pound sand\".\n\nNow, if the circumstances of the resurrection are such that it's premeditated (da Vinci rezzed himself or arranged to be rezzed at a later date), there should be clear contingencies in place to ensure his stuff is maintained in his...really, just a sort of 'absence'.  Otherwise, his giving it away and then coming back to retake it could just be seen as a form of fraud or tax evasion.\n\nParticular to this question...I'm sure the Louvre might reach some arrangement with him, given the extreme circumstances and potential bad press if da Vinci really wanted it that badly.",
            "Well, his heir sold it to the state of France, meaning technically he could try to sue for it since it was sold as stolen property. I doubt he would beat it though, at the time he was announced dead so I believe the sale was legit.",

He doesn't own it anymore.\n\nAnd, if we suppose he never died, and he gave it to the museum, he still wouldn't be able to unless it was predetermined legally that they would only own it for a limited amount of time for showcasing it or something.\n\nBut, otherwise, no. He painted it, sure. But that's not how ownership works. Once rights are transferred, they stay with whoever the rights were transferred to. In this case, the museum.\n\nSource: am artist, have researched ownership and copyright",

            "Well no. It's been sold. Also, as far as I know, it's in the public domain as well, so he wouldn't even be able to own it again even if he really wanted to. Regarding the touching, i think he would be waaaay more happy that the thing still existed at that point. Also people would be constantly asking him who was in the picture, not to mention the fact that he also just came back to life too, so its not like he'd have time to go to paris and touch it anyway hahahaha!",

More importantly, courts haven\u2019t actually ruled in a COTE-consistent manner: they\u2019ll generally uphold a landowner\u2019s subterranean rights near the surface, but \u201cthe deeper the dispute, the less likely courts are to recognize the surface owner\u2019s title.\u201d\n3.

Lot of places outside the West don't necessarily view land ownership the same way. \n\nYou got places where land ownership is communal, open access or state owned. Where a person, or groups of people, can possess one or more of the above rights in the bundle but not possess private ownership of the land and or the area beneath of above it. There's a whole scale from formal to infomal land right basically in which land right can override other land rights ( the reason why government can force you to sell land if it is needed for other usages), overlap, be complementary or clash (where multiple parties view a piece of land as their property)\n\nIf you like to read up on it there is a lot of literature on land use, land rights and land property.

Cuius est solum, eius est usque ad coelum et ad inferos (Latin for \"whoever's is the soil, it is theirs all the way to Heaven and all the way to Hell\") (Wikipedia). \n\nBut. Property ownership is a weird and complicated concept. Traditional metaphor is a bundle of sticks. You own the bundle, and can sever or sell or give different sticks without giving away the whole bundle. So I can sell the mineral rights. Not the soil itself but any specific minerals (oil, coal, water, etc) and the right to come on the property and extract that resource. Which severely impacts the surface functionality in practical terms. \n\nAlso, water is its own separate thing. You might own the water. You might own the right to take a certain amount of water per year for a given purpose. You might own nothing but the River bank up to the water edge and can\u2019t touch the water. It\u2019s complex. \n\nYou can also own a future or contingent interest in the property that can impair the current owners use rights and give you grounds to sue if, say, they tried to sell off the mineral rights or didn\u2019t keep a home in good repair. \n\nSo I own a house. I own the mineral rights under my property. A title search shows no one in the chain of title (previous owners as far back as we know) sold or severed part of the estate.  No one can come on my property and drill a well. My neighbor can\u2019t drill diagonally into my property to drill a well. Theoretically no one can fly a kite or a drone over my house (again, complicated and federal refs for airplanes and shit).

            "I can only speak for England & Wales with any degree of certainty, but it's generally accepted that you own the land to any depth, with certain conditions. \n\n1: the land tenure must be freehold. This means you own the land itself. The alternative is leasehold, meaning you only own the right to occupy the land for a fixed period. The freeholder retains the actual ownership, and may charge a rent. The freeholder may be an individual or individuals, the crown, the church, etc \n\n2: assuming you own the freehold, you generally own the rights to any minerals, natural resources, and wild animals on the land. There are some exceptions, IE coal mines might be permitted to go under your land. \n\n3: sometimes there are covenants and easements to consider. Covenants are conditions of ownership, often put in place at the time of the first sale. IE, you might be prohibited from doing certain smelly jobs like making soap or tallow. Land that was previously owned by the church often has covenants against running funfairs on it. \n\nEasements are conditions that allow a third party use of your land for a specific purpose. IE, if your neighbour needs to cross a bit of your land to get their car on the drive, you can grant them an easement for the purpose. The covenants and easements stay with the land, so if you sell the property, the neighbour can still make use of the easement. \n\nThere's also the interesting case of chancel repair liability, but that's digressing slightly. Hope anyone who reads this finds it interesting.\n\nEdit: here's the phrase I should have remembered.

            "You've gotten a lot of good answers here. One nuance to consider if you live in the USA: while it varies state-by-state, many states allow the land owner to sever the mineral and surface rights meaning that you can buy a whole bunch of land for the mineral value and sell off the surface to someone else or vice versa. You can also buy just the surface or just the minerals. Depending on what deed records say you may own to the center of the earth or you may not. For instance if I own mineral rights down to the center of the earth I can sell you a portion of my mineral rights containing 2,000' to 5,000' below the surface on a particular tract of land. If some oil company wants to drill and produce minerals in that interval you are the person with authority to grant the lease and be paid for a portion of the production. If the producing depth lies outside of that interval then I'm the person they would need to talk to and pay. One more wrinkle: if you own the surface you have the authority to grant rights for constructing a solar or wind farm. If you want to get EXTRA funky with it: Louisiana is different from all of the other states and mineral rights eventually revert to the person who owns the surface. There are rules around how this all takes place but the short explanation is after 10 years (I think?) of mineral ownership with no producing oil and gas wells those mineral rights revert to the current surface owner.",

            "Somewhat related - I work for the US Forest Service as a timber marker and belong to the \"oil and gas\" crew. In this area, the USFS owns the rights to the trees, and private companies own the mineral rights.

Other common sticks in the bundle include roads/access and utilities. There are also less common things like farming, hunting, timber.

Imho it should be the go-to option for any hobbyist/nonprofessional, unless you can somehow get an Altium license.\n- **MobaXterm**: A terminal/SSH client that has a paid version, but the free version still has a ton of handy features. For example, you can connect to a device over SSH and immediately monitor CPU/RAM/storage utilization, access files using a GUI file explorer, and edit files using your laptop\u2019s local software like VSCode or whatever. Speaking of which\u2026\n- **VSCode**: People already said this above, but it\u2019s awesome.\n- **Tabby Terminal**: Another terminal; this one isn\u2019t quite as feature-packed as MobaXterm, but it is FOSS (free and open-source) and really lightweight and user-friendly.\n- **Godot**: A FOSS game engine. I switched from Unity to Godot and never looked back. Probably the best option for any 2D indie game development.\n- **Linux**, especially (imho) **Mint Cinnamon**: I thought switching to Linux would be a massive pain, but Cinnamon made it shockingly smooth. It actually surprised me how refreshing it was to use an OS that didn\u2019t treat me like a child or someone to profit off of. It doesn\u2019t have to ask you for all those permissions to steal your data, or bug you about OneDrive or switching to Edge, or make you go search through a maze of applications just to change one setting. It\u2019s just a pleasure to use.\n- **Wikipedia** (I know it isn\u2019t software per se, but honestly that site is an international treasure and the world should be giving them whatever they need)",
