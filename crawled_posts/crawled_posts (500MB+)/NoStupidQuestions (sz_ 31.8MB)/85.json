Fossils of isolated land plant spores suggest land plants may have been around as long as 475 million years ago.",

            "I'm no algae expert by any means but from what I gathered from a first year introductory algae lecture, I think it's more all plants are 'algae' but not all algae are plants and the term 'algae' itself is quite meaningless. \n\nThe green algae (chlorophytes) are paraphyletic if you don't include the land plants within them, i.e. green land plants are just a derived lineage of green algae.\n\nThen the term algae in general is very polyphyletic, i.e. describes different convergent lineages which don't share much homology with one another making it pretty meaningless from a taxonomic and systematic perspective. For example, there are the archaeplastida containing the glauacophytes, green algae (including the green land plants), and red algae. Then in another clade there are the heterokont algae which include the including brown algae phaeophytes and diatoms. Then there are the dinoflagellate alveolates in a totally unrelated clade of eukaryotes and the euglenid excavates in another lineage again. Then those who include the cyanobacteria in the term algae are introducing a whole new domain of life into the equation!\n\nIn many cases there have been crazy reticulations between different unrelated algae lineages which gave some their photosynthetic power. After the primary endosymbiosis of a cyanobacteria-like prokaryote into the archaeplastida, many other 'algae' obtained their plastids through secondary endosymbiotic events.\nFor example, the phaeophytes and the dinoflagellates each independently obtained their plastids from a red algae they engulfed while the euglenids secondarily obtained their plastids from green algae. \n\nTL;DR algae are very diverse and funky and plants are a kind of green algae",

            "In this particular case it combines two things.\n\n1. Taylor Swift. She's massive and a best selling artist.\n2. The NFL. The most popular sport in the US.\n\nShe's dating a popular NFL star. It's going to get press.\n\nEdit: did not expect this comment to get quite so many responses - can't respond to them all so general response:\n\n1. I'm neither a fan nor do I dislike Taylor Swift. A couple of her songs seem nice but I'm probably a bit old to be a fan.\n2. Yes. Travis Kelce is the greatest tight end ever or whatever. I recognize he's an excellent player and did not mean to downplay that. I do still believe his dating of Taylor is more down to his personality than his sports skills.\n3. For those claiming this is a uniquely US phenomenon, I'm British and pop stars dating sports players literally led to a TV show about it called \"Footballers Wives.\" Let's not pretend this is just the US.\n4. Not going to shit on Taylor Swift either because a lot of her dating is in the public eye or she writes songs about her exes or whatever. All songwriters do that. She's just more famous for it.\n5. It could be a PR stunt. I don't know. I choose to believe that a mega famous popstar and a Superbowl winning footballer can find love in this crazy world. \n\nThink that covers most of the points raised.\n\nEdit to the edit: OK! I get it. Travis Kelce is not the greatest tight end ever. I genuinely don't have skin in this game. He's funny, has a podcast and plays a sport I don't particularly follow. Lol. On a post about why people care about their relationship I do enjoy debate as to A) the greatest tight end and B) if a tight end is even important enough to qualify as great. \n\nGo [insert whatever team makes you happy here]! I follow one sport and one team religiously and that is it. COYS!\n\nFinal edit: I'm up voting all the pro Spurs comments as I believe they add value to the discussion.

            "Taylor Swift has a lot of fans so her fans really care about what she is doing. And this is compounded by the fact that she is dating a popular guy (not the most popular though) on one of the most popular sports team in the most popular sport in America, everything just get compounded.\n\nThe only way I could see it crazier is if she was dating a Cowboys quarterback. But it\u2019s just because the most popular things in America are just building on top of each other.\n\nI think if Taylor was dating a hockey player on a small market team, it wouldn\u2019t be as crazy.",
            "Celebrity and pro athlete obsession is odd to me.     It\u2019s funny too because the guys that know the name of the tight end that got traded to x team would mock the person that follows all the celebrity bs.     I think it\u2019s all equally pointless and a waste of time.  Especially when it\u2019s about someone that doesn\u2019t know or care that you exist.   On the other side of it, those people think I waste my time doing all the maintenance/repair work on my own vehicles when I can easily afford to pay a mechanic.    We all have things we enjoy wasting our limited time on this earth doing.",
            "Cause she\u2019s one of the most famous celebrities atm? Of course a lot of people would be interested. I\u2019m sure wherever you are, a lot of people keep talking about famous people there. \n\nFunny you mentioned you\u2019re European. I am currently in Europe and I was at a coffee shop earlier and I overheard people talking about her several times. First time they ever heard of Travis Kelce lol. \n\nMy point? If you\u2019re famous, many people would be interested to hear anything about you. And when it comes to Taylor Swift, she\u2019s famous in many countries and not just the USA. So this isn\u2019t solely an American thing.",
            "It\u2019s the combination of the most popular Pop star at the moment and one of the most popular NFL Players (with the NFL being the most profitable league in the world). The Kelce brothers were EVERYWHERE in February and we all know that Taylor Swift took over the music scene this year. \n\nAll that being said, it\u2019s nice to have something lighthearted to focus on rn. A lot of people are struggling.",

Yeah, take *that* in.\n\nTaylor Swift pretends to be some battered woman when she's nearly a billionaire. Her fans take her at her word and believe she can do no wrong.

She\u2019s young, attractive, successful, intelligent, powerful\u2026 and single. And now she\u2019s dating an NFL player who is also well known, rich, handsome and physically powerful. So essentially a \u201cpower couple.\u201d  And 56 million is just 16% of the current US population.

Every place she played had to come up with new traffic patterns to handle the onslaught of Swifties.\n\nKelce, on the other hand, just won the NFL championship back in February.\n\nThis is the kind of matchup that rivals Bennifer, Brangelina, or KimYe except nobody questions the skill and talent of the people involved.

And she heard. And she\u2019d admitted to a crush a long time ago. Anyways. Taylor swift also had a song on her first album with the lyric \u201cI\u2019ll be 87, you\u2019ll be 89\u2019. His number is 87. And her album that\u2019s coming out is 89. Now, lots of people are excited for this match because he\u2019s in a completely different field than her. This woman has broken so many records. The only pop star you can compare her to is Michael Jackson. She\u2019s reached a whole new level of fame. This makes her dating life difficult. For someone also famous. And in a different field, it is almost perfect. He rented out a whole restaurant so they could eat in peace. He\u2019s given her a private suite to watch the game. Where she hid in a popcorn cart to get out. Then snuck out and left with no paparazzi. In order for her to do this, it takes planning. It\u2019s probably the first time she\u2019s felt normal in a while. She couldn\u2019t just go to a game. People would swarm around her and it\u2019d be a mess. So I\u2019m not obsessed with who she is dating. But I think \u201cgood for her\u201d when she\u2019s being treated right. It\u2019s puppylove. And hasn\u2019t been serious. Travis, I don\u2019t know a lot about, but a NFL athlete is a big deal in America. Give it some time to die down. Her level of fame will show her doing anything normal. Because for her, normal is hard. She\u2019s just a girl who grew up on a farm. A huge success story. The literal American dream. No there doesn\u2019t need to be a million videos. In fact it\u2019s upsetting people aren\u2019t respecting her privacy, she\u2019s just a normal girl who is really good at writing songs. And knows enough about business to make sure she owns what she puts out. I love Taylor swift. I don\u2019t care who she\u2019s dating. I just wanna stream 1989 soon. It\u2019ll be a banger. I just know.",

            "I\u2019m not a fan, but I considered myself informed enough to give you a short answer: \n\n1- Taylor swift used her past stories with her ex boyfriends on her songs. She exposed a lot of personal issues with those guys and turned it into songs. That\u2019s one of the reasons why girls go so crazy about her, they can relate to the songs strongly. \n2- Travis Kelce is famous now because he\u2019s a great player in his position AND his brother also made it to the NFL, which is incredibly rare, AND they faced each other in the final last year (Super Bowl). That was the first time brothers played in different teams in a Super Bowl. \nAnd still about NFL - if you are European, it\u2019s important to know that soccer isn\u2019t the biggest sport in the us. I just asked my in law if he knew who Messi was, and he didn\u2019t know. American football is the most famous, most watched, and has the craziest fans in America. \n\nSo everybody is like, curious to see 2 super famous people dating. Sort of like what happened to Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt in the past. \n\nNow just a bonus: imagine this mother, who has 2 sons in the NFL, rich and famous, and now she has Taylor Swift spending holidays in her house.

            "I find that honey does not work particularly well if you're not buying products in America. I've been using it for over 4 years and it's only worked a single time by saving me 10 bucks on an Xbox controller; and I shop online at least 4 times a month. Can't really complain I guess; it's 10 dollars I wouldn't have saved otherwise. Definitely some privacy/data acquisition concerns by using it though.\n\nRaycons are awful imo and a pair of decent wired earbuds will be a fraction of the price and sound better. If you really do need that Bluetooth then they're going to be cheaper than Apple or Samsung buds, but I still find raycons hard to recommend. A YouTube channel called DankPods (it's like an audiophile/audio enthusiast channel) has 2 vids on Raycons earbuds, so I'd you want the opinion of someone who actually knows what they're talking about then I recommend watching those. [DankPods Raycon E25 Review](https://youtu.be/iyzMSevpT2I), and the [DankPods Raycon E25 Pro Review](https://youtu.be/zb58b7ob2yQ). He got sponsored for the 2nd video after trashing Raycons on the first one, and then proceeded to give an honest opinion and trash them in the 2nd review as well.\n\nI've had a good experience with Skillshare, found some interesting series for programming, photography, and animation pretty easily.\n\nHarry's has been pretty good and I used them for about 2 years before investing in an electric razor. Their blades were pretty good and sharp, and one lasted me multiple shaves before I feel it start tugging on my facial hair. I also found their customer service to be very good; I cancelled my subscription a day after a new set of blades got shipped from their warehouse and they gave me a full refund for it and let me keep the blades when they showed up anyways.",

It taught me a lot of techniques I still use today, although I have since cancelled due to cost. I recommend getting BA for like a college student living on their own for the first time. Hello Fresh was okay, but too simple for me. SunBasket was garbage.\n\nI like my Rothy's ok, but they were a little too small for me.

All that's really happening is masking your actions from your provider, but NOT FROM ANYONE ELSE who normally has access to that information. Sites and advertisers will still track you and governments can still subpoena your actions (depending on the VPN they may not have much info to give though).  So you are simply adding one more player into the chain you follow to connect to the web and giving them your details.\n- Honey: does what it says on the tin, but suffers on sites that don't give out coupons regularly or that give out new coupons on a daily basis.  VERY GOOD FOR PIZZA.\n- Dollar Shave Club, they drop ship razors from an established supplier.  They aren't bad, and are cheap enough, but I don't shave often enough for a subscription.  Just a big standard razor.\n- Raycons, dogshit\n- Skillshare, never used it, because I've managed to find the tutorials I need elsewhere.

            "I can't speak to these products, but as a general rule, if you see an ad for a company often, they spend a lot of money on advertising.  This doesn't mean they have a bad product, but there is probably some comparable alternative who devotes their resources to improving the product.  Beer is the best example.  Bud light is dog shit, but it's the most well known beer because they dump a butt load of money into advertising.",
            "They're not going to necessarily be bad products, but the reason they're advertised everywhere is because they have a *huge* marketing budget. Which means the markup on the products (what they cost to make and deliver, vs what you're charged) has to be large enough to accommodate what they spend on sponsoring, because people *trust* their favourite streamers and youtubers! And those streamers and youtubers can make that a fulltime job, *because* they earn so much from their very lucrative sponsors.\n\nAre the products automatically *bad quality?* No.... but they're going to be *bad value*. Raid Shadow Legends was able to buy every large name streamer because it's full of predatory mtx that suck money. I'd be wary of any product that is advertised *so broadly* as to feel ubiquitous. The compensation for how much advertising a product gets will have to come out of *your* pocket.\n\nI'd say **digital services** like Honey and Skillshare are probably the only *possible* exception because they make one product that profits from all of its users, rather than having to give each user their own products. (Nord VPN and especially Surfshark are bad services for other reasons, though.)\n\nFor the earbuds, which are physical products, definitely don't bother. They don't even need to be good quality tbh; because people will worship their online idols, they'll sell plenty of them whether they're good or not. Less money spent on product quality can be spent on sponsoring to convince you to buy it anyway. For you as an end consumer who wants *the product* and not the *parasocial relationship*, you'll find much better deals online.",

            "One helpful piece of advice my therapist gave me is, do not call yourself a \"bad person.\" Doing that actually excuses your behavior (because a bad person naturally does bad things, that's just how it goes \ud83e\udd37) and puts you in a frame of mind where you are likely to continue doing bad things. Instead, it's important to frame it as, you are a person who has done bad things. The important thing is to focus on not doing those things anymore, and learning how not to. IDK it seems like a pedantic difference but to me it makes a big difference. I too am coping with how some of my despicable actions have hurt people. They have also hurt me and my trust in myself, and I think about it every day. \n\n \"the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step\" and the most important part of the journey is realizing there is a problem in the first place. You were at a lower level of consciousness when you were doing those things. You are now at a different, more mature stage, even if only by a small margin. Keep your eye on the goal, which is to be a person who loves others and brings light into the world. If you are only looking backwards, you are likely to repeat your mistakes (try walking forwards while looking behind you... it's very hard). You won't forget what you've done and you shouldn't, but dwelling on it all will only make you feel worse and leave less room in your heart for goodness.\n\nYou got this, I got this, we all got this \u270a",

I turned 25 in 2020 and after some real shitshow stuff went down j took a long look at my life and realized how selfish and toxic I'd been for a long time and it crushed me. I developed panic attacks started binge eating and drinking to cope. My vision of my self was shattered and it was horrific. While my actions showed growth immediately I was still in a sea of self loathing. Then I was reminded that it's not up to us to decide if we are a good or bad person, it's up to the people we interact with.  let your actions lead and your heart will follow. You're doing a good thing by realizing you needed to make changes, now just focus on today.",
            "You try to do better. You apologize to who you can and you move on and become a better person. Not everyone will accept your apology and they don't owe you forgiveness.

Make amends for things you can make amends for, even if it's just an apology. People experience a lot of different things. Some of the people you've hurt may have done the same things to other people and they would understand. Just remember that some people won't be forgiving.

            "I had a similar experience in my mid-20s.  I'm glad it happened to me.  First thing I did was I took time to understand the way my actions affected others.  Then I was able to forgive myself.  Forgiveness is not condoning what I had done, but owning it and at my core making a change.  Ever since then (almost 25 years later) I apply those lessons learned to everyone I interact with.  I've had a very successful, happy, and full life since.\n\nI tried to apologize to everyone I wronged, but it was not possible for everyone.  For those people, they should know I've lived my left since making sure I treat and respect people much better than I did to them.\n\nEdit:  for those who might read this. I don't let the actions of the past hang over me.  Once you understand the consequences your selfish actions have on others - the way you interact with and treat people will change for the better - assuming you want to change.  You can't change the past and you can't make the hurt go away - but you can make a positive change going forward.",

            "This will get buried but shame is useless now. Hating yourself and being consumed by the thoughts of how you used to behave doesn't help you, and it doesn't really help the people you've hurt, beyond maybe a short-lived satisfaction that you're now suffering for your previous behavior.\n\nI've struggled with shame over all sorts of things, and was convinced that I wasn't a good person and could never become one. I hated myself so much that while I was willing to die because of how bad of a person I felt I was, I wasn't willing to live to try to be the type of person I thought was good.\n\nIt's not about hating yourself - it's about loving yourself so much that your love continues to spread to the people in your life and your community and this world.

            "So, when I turned 30 I was hit by the irrefutable fact that I was an angry, lazy, racist, dick head of an asshole who thought the world owed him something. \n  \nYou know that saying about assholes? The one that says \"if everyone you meet is an asshole, you're probably the asshole.\" Yeah, that was me. I thought my friends were selfish dicks. I was mean. I was a bully. Although my ex is not completely innocent, I was a dick to her when I shouldn't have been.\n  \nWhen I hit my 30s,I realized how lonely I was. I realized I was tired of being so pissed off all the damn time. I started working on myself. I opened up my social circle and started hanging with people I normally wouldn't. They opened my eyes to thinking in ways I hadnt. I started working out and being less lazy. I started applying myself, I built a business that landed me my dream job, which has opened up even more opportunities. I left my ex instead of torturing her with our incompatibility.\n  \nLife did throw me a curve ball when I was 33 when my brother unexpectedly took his life. The major difference though? I had so many loving friends who came to me. People who cried with me and cared for me. It was eye opening in a completely different way from finding out you're a prick.\n  \nI spend most of my time taking care of my wife, now. I stay active in my community and give back when I can. I advocate for suicide awareness and multiple times I have been the \"last call\" for some friends, who I am happy to say are still here today.\n  \nI hate who I used to be, but that person was necessary for me to become me, now.\n  \nSo my advice if you've only recently realized you've been terrible? Be kind. Give kindness freely. Love as much as you can. Find happiness. It's okay to remember the person you used to be, but don't let that person stop you from being the person you want to be.",

And how the lies & manipulation effect the psyche of those closest to you.

Honesty with others & yourself, and being willing to lay your transgressions out for others. Don't judge, and don't force relationships to work. \n\nGood Luck on your journey, and keep your head up.

            "Even after my BPD diagnosis, it took me about 2 years to realize even though I had bad things done to me, it didn't excuse me being an utterly shitty person. Similarly, I fucked a lot of people over. Like, half my HS class has me blocked because in one form or another I've been a major bitch to them. Coming to terms meant I felt like I owed a lot of these people an apology. I just changed my life around, starting being a genuinely nice person, and a lot of these people gravitated back to me over time. Some of them haven't, and some have checked in through mutual, and I've made amends where I felt it was appropriate. There's grace in knowing you *didn't know*, because truthfully anyone can make mistakes. Now that you do know, you can live a positive healthy life where you're proud of your actions. I always just imagine there's a camera livestreaming me, and everyone I've done wrong is watching, when I feel tempted to behave like I used to. I'm like damn, I'd hate for them to still be right about me being an ass, so I react better. Also, 1st thought, 2nd thought, orientation has really seemed to help me. I was told your first thought is your taught reaction, example \"crackhead\" plays through your mind when you see someone on the street, then your 2nd thought is your authentic self thinking, \"damn, that's someone's brother. That is a sad situation.\" Often our first voice is influenced, and wrong. Give yourself tike to react, so your genuine compassion gets a chance to chime in. Hope this is helpful",

Some will forgive you and some won't and you need to deal with that yourself. You can't make people do things they dont want to do. Keep reflecting and try to gradually forgive yourself. Everyone makes mistakes and it takes a good person and a lot of effort to see that and feel sorry. People CAN change! You didn't know better and now you DO and you feel sorry. That is enough.

Depending how old you are, it may be too late to do more good than the harm you have already done ... but you can try.  \n\n\nIn Judaism, we believe that you can't be forgiven without fixing what you broke.  But we also recognize that, in cases like yours, that is simply impossible - that any attempt to fix things will make things worse.\n\nSo we also have a concept that, if you truly change who you are, genuinely change the part of yourself that was so broken that it broke other people, you are allowed to start over.  Like declaring bankruptcy when you are too far in debt to ever get out.  It has costs and makes things harder in some ways, but it also gives you a clean slate to start over.\n\nSometimes people mark this by changing their use-name - even if they don't change their name legally, they go by a different version of their name, or stop using an existing nickname, or like that.  They change what they are called, so that that old name was the person who sucked, and the new name is the person who is starting over.\n\nExternal changes like what people call you, how you dress, how you carry yourself - these can be signs to remind you to be different internally as well.

Reality can be described mathematically, but no where in the standard model of particle physics is there scope for a person to choose how their atoms behave. You, as a conscious organism are *responsible* for the choices your brain makes, because that's how society functions, but you don't actually get to choose the choices you make; the physical properties of  matter in your head behaves as it **must**.\n\nI have always been a pretty decent person (when I'm not on Reddit), but if I were you, I would have been terrible too.

I was maybe 10 or so, and my cat was sitting on my lap, and i was petting him. And suddenly i was acutely aware of the fact that he was an entirely separate entity with needs, desires, preferences, and emotions not too disimilar to my own. He was leading an existence as real and visceral as i was. And he was choosing to spend that time with me. It was intense. Then it was quickly followed by the realization that i had been more or less treating him as some combination of toy and furniture before that. Just a pillow that was nice to cuddle but it didn't always stay where i left it. That was a pretty heavy realization, and it came with a great sense of shame about all the times i had blatantly disrespected his autonomy and made him miserable, and then the fact that despite that, he still wanted to spend time with me became all the more intense. I tried to explain this to my dad at the time, but failed miserably, lacking the words to properly convey such umderstamding in a way that didn't sound trivial and obvious. \n\nStrangely, would be years before i had a similar revelation about people, even though i was always a pretty empathetic kid.

If not for these restrictions, there could be many pharmaceutical companies competing and that would lead to a lower, more appropriate cost. \n\nMy econ teacher is a libertarian though, and wanted to get rid of the FDA, so I take what he says with a grain of salt.",
            "Basic insulins are not expensive to manufacture, 20 years ago today's $300 vial cost about $20. The huge \"mark-ups\" in price come from Pharmacy Benefits Managers or \"PBMs\". Companies that manage prescription drug benefits for health insurance companies. This is where the politics of health insurance come into play. A PBM may exclude a particular brand of medication from coverage under their companies policy. I.E. not covered by insurance. \n\nA PBM makes money off of rebates from the manufacturer. The manufacturer provides the PBM a rebate in order to have their products eligible for coverage. Manufacturers in turn need to raise their prices to counter any rebate they give the PBM. This is where the high cost of insulin comes from. \n\nThe OP asks why isn't anyone undercutting the price. There are many business factors around R&D and licenses that make that difficult. HOWEVER! A year or two ago insulin manufacturer Eli Lilly released a generic version of the rapid acting insulin Humalog. The generic version, Lispro wasn't covered under any insurance, but was less than half the price of name brand. \n\nNow, with insurance it's cheaper to still get the name brand, after prescription co-pay. Because, the generic wasn't covered by insurance it isn't eligible for a co-pay. (the PBMs didn't get a rebate so it's not eligible for coverage). \n\nWith or without insurance, the generic costs the same price. \n\nIf Eli Lilly already has rights to sell the name brand why make a generic that isn't covered by any insurance policies and undersells their own product? \n\nBecause then they collect on the entire \"no insurance\" customer base AND drive down the price of insulin. This is the best example I could come up with where a company is actively trying to undercut the high market cost of insulin while still making the profit they need to stay in business. \n\nA few others mentioned Wal-Mart for diabetic supplies. This is hands down the most cost effective place to get insulins and blood sugar test strips!",
            "One reason that isn't talked about is that capitalism works well for buyers when pricing is apparent. But because pricing is nebulous, with different rates for different situations and different per store, state, etc... and not transparent whatsoever, there is no market pressure to lower cost.\n\nIf insulin was sold on Amazon it'd be incredibly cheap but obviously you can't do that safely.\n\nCapitalism is great for some markets, but not for all and we should adjust accordingly.",
            "It's called \"collusion\" in the anti-trust laws.  It was at one time unlawful.  These days if you can afford to spread a couple billion around the legislature, you get a loophole.\n\nBTW, watch them outlaw the open-insulin bio-hacker project, once they're actually able to produce the stuff.  There is too much money to be had for the current producers to let go so easily.\n\nEdit:  It's worth noting that the folks who discovered it essentially gave away the patent, for the explicitly stated reason of avoiding exactly this situation.",
            "The cost to register a medicinal product and get it to market is very high. Some off-patent versions are no longer registered by the original company, so a generic company would need to complete a full registration.",
            "Walmart offers certain types of insulin for $25/vial, but using it does require some lifestyle adjustments as it is an older version that often requires a bit more planning and menu control/timing.\n\nIt's the newest stuff that gets up to $300 a vial, but many diabetics could use (and did use for many years) the older stuff.",
            "There are a couple of major factors that prevent this. Insulin is produced by like 2-3 large pharmaceutical companies. Since US patent law allows new patents to be made so long as a product is different from a previous iteration (note that different DOES NOT mean better), these companies can maintain control over the supply by making minor changes to their insulin formulas. As long as they can prove its not worse, they can patent it. They then use their money to buy off Congress (Google Big Pharma or The Pharmaceutical Lobby) to loosen regulations for them while not allowing competitors in. Finally, they raise insulin prices in literal lockstep with each other. Since the pharma companies used their money to eliminate the threat of competition, they can raise prices together, and both companies increase their profits. It's extremely broken.\n\nThe history of diabetic Insulin might interest you, especially its origins. Patriot Act with Hasan Minaj on Netflix has an episode (I think its called Drug Pricing) that focuses pretty heavily on why Insulin (and Healthcare in general) is so expensive in America and why it's stayed that way for so long.",
            "Many people are, it's just it's almost a perfect market for a monopoly. There are currently only 3 companies that make like 95% of the insulin in the U.S. all three of them work together as to not really have competition with one another. \n\nThere are a couple reasons why. The first is that it takes years for a biochemical drug (which is what insulin is) to get approved by the FDA. I think the average is 17 years. Also that means 17 years once you figure out how to make a new drug, so probably years before you get to that point. \n\nNot only that, but it costs a ton of money too. Most of the companies that release new biochemical drugs already exist and make a lot of money before they make a new one. The amount of money for a company to exist without selling anything for 17 years is a lot.\n\nIt's not like anyone can make the insulin that those three companies are making either, or they would sue you.",
            "It\u2019s actually illegal to import insulin for Americans.",
            "Because it\u2019s a legalized price fixing. You have to be licensed to sell it. If you under cut the market, they will vote to revoke your license.",
            "Traditional insulin actually isn't that expensive.  In fact, it has been stable over the past few years.  Newer insulins are harder to make and offer better long term glucose control.  These advances depend on longer and shorter acting insulins, which are hard to synthesize and control for safety.  Because of the expertise needed in manufacturing, prices are high.  \n\nThere are huge barriers in place to produce insulin, so market forces play less of a role in delivering cheap drugs.  \n\n[https://www.goodrx.com/blog/how-much-does-insulin-cost-compare-brands/](https://www.goodrx.com/blog/how-much-does-insulin-cost-compare-brands/)",

            "Demand for insulin is almost perfectly inelastic people will buy the same amount of insulin regardless of the price as long as they can still afford it because they will die of they don't. The current market has settled on a price that maximizes profits for companies that selling insulin. This means that if they could make more money by selling it at a lower price they already would have done that. They would also charge more money per dose if it would net them a greater profit.",
            "Part of the problem is that because most people are insured, there\u2019s a distortion between insulin pricing and what most customers pay. Most Americans don\u2019t have to pay the full price of insulin so pharmaceuticals can raise the price because they know insurance companies will pay up and customers won\u2019t really feel it. That makes the biggest victims of the insulin crisis the uninsured. \n\nThe second part of the problem is that there\u2019s no bargaining power on the part of customers. Partially because of problem #1, in that they don\u2019t have to pay full price, partially because they don\u2019t get to market shop for different kinds of insulin - their doctors do that for them and do it without personal sensitivity to prices, and lastly, because these patients NEED it and so aren\u2019t in a position to walk away.\n\nThe last big part of the problem is that the versions of insulin that exist today aren\u2019t the same kinds of insulin that existed in the past. That allows manufacturers to keep insulin protected by patents as they revoke the labels of and discontinue the older versions of insulin, making it harder for genetics to come to market. Older generic versions of insulin still exist by the way, but they\u2019re not as good and they aren\u2019t what doctors are prescribing. For generic versions of insulin to come onto the market when the labels have been revoked, they\u2019d have to repeat the clinical trials which are crazy expensive. The cost of those trials, coupled w the fact that the relevant information could no longer be patent protected, means that the generics would be unable to recoup the costs of the trials. That\u2019s why they don\u2019t do them. \n\n\nOne solution is to have a single payer healthcare system that could bargain with drug manufacturers directly. Universal coverage would mean access would no longer be a problem. Poof goes the tragedy of the uninsured diabetic who rations out his insulin and dies an entirely preventable death.

Additionally, US consumers tend to buy from *the same* companies as say Canadian consumers. The high price is not gouging from the pharmaceutical companies, but a result of the US private insurance systems.\n\nThe vast majority of Americans are covered by insurance and the vast majority of money taken in by pharmaceutical companies comes from insurance (and Medicare). The high cost associated with regulatory approval, quality control, distribution and liability makes it unreasonable to undercut pharmaceutical companies for the relatively small number of Americans not on insurance. Insurance companies are not interested in cost cutting for a single drug, as they negotiate payment contracts with pharmaceutical companies as enormous package deals.",

In order to try and step in and undercut the market you would have to develop your own new genetically modified insulin and do years of clinical trials and then get FDA approval as a new drug.\n\nPoliticians talk about how the drug prices are controlled by the free market and competition brings prices down, but the only real market \u201ccompetition\u201d is the drug manufacturers fighting to see exactly how much they can force insurance companies to pay for their products.",

            "I\u2019ve wondered this as well. It didn\u2019t used to be the default. Back in the day, it was defaulted to 12pt, Times New Roman font. But maybe these days they\u2019re more focused on what\u2019s pleasing to the eye.",

(An important factor when you have 50-80 essays or more to grade.)\n\nPoint size is not absolute. Different typefaces have different proportions. The most important measure is called the x-height, which is the height of the lower-case letterforms. A modern face like Calibri has a taller x-height, and appears \u201clarger\u201d than Times at the same point size, so line length and readability for a face like Calibri is 11 point,  vs. 12 point for Times.\n\n*(I am a pro designer with 25 years of experience, and teach typography at the college/university level.)*",

I took a course in design and Times New Roman font is the easiest on the eyes (it's a serif font with the little extra lines on the T and the g, etc) when reading print paper. Times New Roman is a serif typeface designed for legibility in body text (back in the newspaper and print age).  In the past, Microsoft Word might've assumed the documents written will most likely be printed. However, with the digital age, Google docs and Microsoft have now switched to something that is easier to read (that is sans serif) online. It might also look a bit more \"modern\". That's just a guess though.\n\nIn terms of the size, it could be because of print vs. digital readability \\^.

            "This will be clearer to older folks, I think, I've been using 11pt on my own stuff since the '80s, with my first printer -- a daisy wheel. It's about the same size type as the Royal Selectric typewriter which was the pre-computer standard in offices, so I assume the boss just kept on wanting his memos printed in the size he was used to seeing.\n\nSometime in the late '90s, shortly before I retired, my employer sent around a \"standards\" memo laying out exactly how he expected our printed docs to look. (First on the the list was \"NO COMIC SANS EVER!\") He had us switch to 12pt type, with headings in 15pt, simply because it was a little easier to read for older staff members (like him).\n\nI imagine something similar took place in offices all over the country during the '90s, when we were making the switch from typewriters to digital word processing. I still use 11pt personally, just because all my templates are set up that way and I'm used to it.",
            "The change from Times New Roman 12 pt to Calibri 11 pt has to do with MS (and then other companies) recognizing that printing the pages was no longer the norm, and so they made the switch to improve screen legibility. \n\nWhile this effectively explains the font differences, you may still be wondering why they also changed the sizes. The answer is ClearType: the software that improves screen readability of text that they overhauled for Windows 7 meant that they designed fonts and sizes specifically to look best with that software.

            "I don't know about the size, but Calibri is a sans serif font, whereas Times New Roman was serif. Serif fonts have little ticks/marks on the ends of letters; sans-serif do not.

            "So two parts to this. One is that people don't tend to use very good titles, especially in image posts, and reddit does not (to the best of my knowledge) use tags or any form of content recognition to categorize images/videos. Trying to find the video of that cute \"black and white cat doing a backflip\" will likely yeild poor results because it was probably titled something like \"so cute, what should I name him\" or some other generic crap like that. This explains why Reddit's search is so bad, but why is Google so good? Well the short answer is, is it's their main product. They can spend time building the perfect algorithm that parses not only titles of posts, but comments, usernames, dates, and can even look for visually similar images to try and get tags/search criteria from those images and their discussion. Stuff that sites like Reddit don't have the time, computing power, or experience to implement. They then have entire data centers parsing and processing this data before someone even thinks about making a search. Places like Google have essentially indexed and categorized the entire internet, so a search is as simple as referencing a prebuilt file.

            "The key to a good search is indexing. If I go to a library to find a book, I have a few options:\n\nA: I could start at the first book and work my way through the whole library until I find what I\u2019m looking for. This would be painfully long and slow, but I am basically guaranteed to find what I\u2019m looking for.\n\nB: I could find the section I think the book is in and do the same as option A, but only for that section. This is much faster but only works if I was right about the section. If not, I have to choose another section and repeat.\n\nC: I could use an index. Most libraries will have what are called \u201ccatalog cards\u201d which can be physical cards in drawers or digital lists in a computer. Somebody has spent time creating lists of books that correspond to a particular subject. The books could be located all over the library in different sections but are listed together in the index. Now I just have to find the index that I want and check if my book is on it.\n\nNow it\u2019s important to note that indexes are not free. They take time to put together and have to be stored somewhere. Indexes also have to be helpful. Libraries have to guess what kind of information someone will want to find, they can\u2019t just make indexes for everything. This is where Reddit search fails. Content on Reddit is so diverse and disjointed that it\u2019s very difficult to create helpful indexes for search. Reddit is not a search engine company so the resources they put towards that effort will be much less than say Google. Now you can imagine that the entire internet is much more diverse and disjointed than the relatively tiny piece that is Reddit, however, Google\u2019s entire business is built upon indexing/search technology. It\u2019s really not a huge surprise that they do a better job, it\u2019s literally their entire job.

All of these tech companies rush to bring things out that are newer and faster yet they don't seem to solve these little glitches. \n\nThe other day I was on a bike ride and wanted to stop to quickly get directions. Instead I sat on the side of the road for nine minutes. Why? Because I tried to open my phone, open my map app, and enter the address I was heading to. Nothing complicated, just trying to perform basic functions the phone should be able to perform, but it froze up for nine minutes. It froze for a minute or two when opening the phone, then again when opening the app, then it frozen when I clicked on the search bar because it wanted to give me an error message to let me know that the map app which had finally opened was having trouble opening. In the middle of my exercise, I had to take an unscheduled nine minute break for doing simple, basic things with my phone.\n\nFor my next phone, I don't want it to have anything new. I want it to be able to do everything my current phone can and nothing else, however I don't want it to have these stupid little glitches on its basic functions.

            "Soo, I\u2019ve seen literally no one try to answer this question in earnest, so here\u2019s an attempt at a technical explanation (to the best of my knowledge as a web developer).\n\nI assume you\u2019re using desktop web reddit.  When you hit the back button, you\u2019re essentially taken out of Reddit\u2019s control, and are now at the discretion of the browser.  For all the browser knows, you just hit \u201cTake me back to reddit.com\u201d and it does that.  The browser doesn\u2019t inherently save your place on a webpage, and reddit has no control over that.\n\nTo fix this, reddit would have to add some special code to store in your user session exactly how far down the page you were, and then when that page loads, run that code to scroll you back to that locally.  The problem is, the front page is always changing, so how would it store that value? A number of posts down? Last post scrolled past? It\u2019s more complicated than you may think.  So, reddit mostly just let\u2019s the browser be the browser here, without getting to smart about it.  A lot of websites are shitty or messed up *because* the deva tried to outsmart the browser, so I\u2019m glad Reddit is hands off here.",
