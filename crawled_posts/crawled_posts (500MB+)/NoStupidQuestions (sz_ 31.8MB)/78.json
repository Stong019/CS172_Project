They take tax money off of you regardless and spend it on stuff you have no idea.

Is it just \"i had to do it so they should do too\" mentality? If so, do they know what inflation is and how economy doesn't stay the same for decades?\n\nEdit: If you are unsatisfied because you know this fixes nothing and education still will be expensive and they need to fix that rather than just forgiving debts, I would agree but that seems a lot difficult tbf. Well.. it seems only difficult for America at least.",

            "I don\u2019t entirely understand how it works. If we forgive loans now will we forgive loans for the next batch of students or will they just end up screwed? If you do nothing about the cost of education then forgiving loans seems pointless because it doesn\u2019t stop the cycle of putting students in massive amounts of debt.",
            "A few reasons I know by interacting with people\n\n1. People who paid the loan don't like the idea that they didn't get this benefit. They cut their savings and lifestyle to pay back the loan faster/on-time.\n\n2. This doesn't solve problem, but it's a signal to education institution, that they can charge as they want and government will come later and bailed out the students.\n\n3. Adding to inflation\n\n4. People who don't go to college are indirectly contributing towards this forgiveness. And there is no benefits they are getting out of this. They see as a waste of their taxes.\n\n5. This is just a political move and doesn't solve the core issue.\n\nPersonally I fall under 2 option. I think this will just encourage the universities to charge as much as they can.",
            "It does nothing to stem the cause.",
            "because they already paid theirs off",
            "Freakonomics podcast had an episode about this. Lots of points but a big one is that it\u2019s paid by taxpayers. And college or university graduates typically have much much higher incomes throughout their lives. So it\u2019s like a tax break for the statistically most likely group of people to not need a tax break. \n\nAlso it incentivizes bad debt management by students in the future that might see a chance that future debt would be cancelled.\n\nLastly it pisses people off if they \u201cdid the right thing\u201d and prioritized their student debt payments.",
            "Everything a government spends money on has an opportunity cost, and therefore creates winners and losers.\n\nIn this case, the losers are the people who didn't benefit from going to college, who are now being asked to subsidize the education of the people who did.\n\nYou can make an argument that they might indirectly benefit, certainly.  But it's hard to visualise when you are struggling to keep your head above water right now.",
            "Because we got into this problem by making money for higher education artificially cheap. Tuition grew to account for all the secured loans & grants.\n\nNow we are doing it again & will make the problem worse for the next crop of students. Fighting fire with gasoline doesn't work.\n\nAnd it's not fair to the people who haven't gone yet, nor the people who didn't go as they will be paying the price through increased tuition, or inflation, or both while receiving none of the benefit. The people who benefit most need it the least.\n\nWe spend a lot of money to make a problem worse & delay fixing it even longer.  The absolute worst part is it's the college educated who should understand this is both unjust & unwise, but their tuition didn't buy them any principles or wisdom.",
            "I don\u2019t care if some loans are forgiven.  When I graduated 30 years ago tuition was $3000 a year.  Now it\u2019s closer to $20k (in state, state school)\n\nBut I can understand being upset if you didn\u2019t go to school because you couldn\u2019t afford it.  And now you find out you could have borrowed and had it forgiven.  \n\nBut let\u2019s not forget that almost every small business got free loans during the pandemic.  So maybe we should all relax a little.",
            "Since nobody in this thread seems to have found an actual answer; \n\nBecause the money still needs to be paid. Cancelling student loans doesn\u2019t make the millions of notes suddenly evaporate, it forces the tax system to adopt the debt, of which there is a lot. \n\nJust because the majority of loans are federally funded that doesn\u2019t mean they can just be torn in half, it\u2019s still real money, owed to private companies that the government will be forced to pay. This redirects the burden to the taxpayers rather than the individual borrowers. I signed for a loan to buy my truck, I don\u2019t particularly want to pay it, but it\u2019s what I agreed to and that makes it my responsibility, not my neighbors.\n\nAnd the second reason is cancellation does not solve the core problem of why student debt is so high to begin with, it doesn\u2019t go after tuition hyperinflation and essentially guarantees loan companies and schools that they can make up whatever numbers they like and the government will pay for it. \n\nNot only would it not solve any problems, it would arguably introduce some major new ones.\n\nEdit; \n\nThere seems to be a common misconception floating around that the debt doesn\u2019t need to be repaid to anyone because it\u2019s federally originated money, I think it\u2019s important people understand how the treasury actually pays their bills, they don\u2019t cut satisfaction amounts to institutions the moment you sign up for a federally backed loan, they pay private institutions on delayed schedules or block payments, sometimes not even until you\u2019ve graduated or paid a significant portion back.\n\nIt\u2019s also very important to remember not all federal loan money is originated in the treasury, all federal loans are federally underwritten, but countless billions of those dollars are originating through the big banks, with the understanding that they are federally backed should the borrower default. This is an integral and fundamental cog in our nations economy. \n\nI\u2019m having a hard time jumping onboard with just printing more money to cancel, this seems like a speed-run strategy to hyperinflation and uncontrollable tuition hikes.",
            "I don't support cancellation. But I sure as hell support loans being interest free - at least the portion that covers tuition.",
            "It\u2019s like a bandaid for a hemorrhage. The underlying problem is not solved and will continue to grow worse. We either need to return to direct funding for colleges and ending student loans, or price fix colleges who receive student loan funding so these loans don\u2019t get out of hand. Ending federal student loans is the first step. \n\nPeople also don\u2019t like the idea of people who chose to get a degree that doesn\u2019t pay enough to allow them to pay down their loans getting subsidized by the government. It\u2019s a shit show all around, but the economy at large would likely benefit pretty significantly if people could use that money to save or spend on goods and services rather than pay down an inflated debt the government already holds.",
            "There\u2019s a few reasons I\u2019ve heard... \n\n#1. The Unfair Reason: Many people took out student loans and then paid them off by working very hard over a long period of time. \n\n#2. The Monetary Reason: The money to pay off these loans will eventually catch up to the American Tax Payer somehow. Whether it be though tax hikes or inflation\u2026 we all will eventually pay for it. \n\n#3. The Big Picture Reason: The reason people were able to take these massive burdens of student loans is because the Government started subsidizing them. Back in the day it used to be a risk for a bank to give a university hopeful a loan and they were more careful to issue loans to people who they thought could earn a decent living and pay it off. When the Government started subsidizing loans, everyone and their mom student got loans and the universities upped college costs because the loans were guaranteed. Basically, the government is providing a temporary solution to a problem that they themselves caused. \n\n#4. The Constitutional Reason: The President does not have the power to unilaterally decide to spend billions of dollars like this. It\u2019s an abuse of Presidential Authority. This should have been a Bill presented in the Legislature. Congress holds the \u201cpurse strings\u201d, not the President.\n\nEdit: I did not intend to have the font be so massive and I don\u2019t know how to adjust it\u2026 my apologies.",
            "I didn\u2019t go to college partially because I didn\u2019t want to get a bunch of student loan debt. Now you\u2019re telling me after years of working construction busting my ass out in the heat and freezing cold etc that my tax dollars are going to go towards paying other people\u2019s student loans off, who are mostly making more money than me to work in an office?

            "Only 35% of Americans have college degrees. The 65% are justifiably frustrated their taxes are going to support those folks who on average make more money and live longer better lives...",
            "Well, would you consider it fair to pay off a loan someone else took on in good faith? How come my loans don\u2019t get paid off? That\u2019s probably the sentiment. \n\nIt also distorts the market for higher education, and may end up making education more expensive overall.",
            "Hi, college student here - political science major at that. \n\nYour question is framed in bad faith. You set up various traps for anyone who doesn\u2019t give you the \u201cright\u201d answer. You imply that people who\u2019re against the cancellation are \u201coutright evil.\u201d You then appeal to pathos and tell people that they essentially want to bind their kids and future generations to lifelong debt. \n\nBecause I don\u2019t wanna get banned for calling you out on your bullshit, I\u2019ll answer the question. Cancelling student loan debt that these people willingly agreed to take on will only force tax payers who didn\u2019t make such a bad decision to pay the consequences of it. If Joe Biden really cared about helping American college graduates and students, he\u2019d make college more affordable and easily-accessible to all social classes. He\u2019s not doing this because he wants to help people, he\u2019s doing it because it\u2019ll help him get re-elected.",

Kinda sucks & is a slap in the face. \n\nI don\u2019t think that people are necessarily mad at loans being forgiven , they\u2019re just mad at the fact that all of the money they spent paying off their loans & the stress & hardships that came along with it \u2014-they\u2019ll never get that money back. \nI can\u2019t blame them for feeling some type of way. It\u2019s very easy to think they\u2019re just bitter , if you haven\u2019t gone through the hassle of paying the loans off.\n\nI wish that since loans are being forgiven , people who paid off their loans prior to this could atleast get some type of compensation to be fair.. but we don\u2019t live in that kind of world, unfortunately.",

            "It's because I pay taxes. Tax money shouldn't be used to pay off individual debt. Period.  Imagine if you decided to learn a trade as I did because you could not afford to go to college outright and didn't WANT to pay off thousands in student loans, then took an entry level job for low wages, worked thirty years growing and maturing your career until you FINALLY made the ever desired 6 figure income,  and then I told you that you had to pay off the loans of someone else who went to college so they can START at a 6 figure income with no debt. You'd be like, fuck that.  There's a REASON I went the route I did, and it was so I DIDN'T have to pay off student loans. If I didn't wanna pay them off for MYSELF,  I damn sure don't wanna pay them off for someone else! The way I see it, YOU took out the loan, not me. But I'll make you a deal.  When the streets and bridges here in Illinois are fixed properly, the cops and firefighters aren't being laid off, the elementary and high schools have the books and equipment they need to educate kids BEFORE they reach the collegiate level, and there aren't THOUSANDS of starving and homeless people and elderly going without medical insurance,  you can have all the loan forgiveness you need.  Until then,  I have no sympathy.  Read the fine print next time. Think before you sign. Learn a profession that's worth the cost of tuition. You don't see lawyers and doctors and high finance people struggling the same as the gender equality majors out there.  Make sure the juice is worth the squeeze.  And this isn't hate on the students.  It's on the colleges that sold them a worthless degree and didn't actually prepare them for the real world, which is pretty much their sole function at that level. I feel for the kids who were deceived into thinking if they studied art history hard enough, they'd have an easy ride. But I'M not the one who lied to them. Make the COLLEGES forgive the debt.

Should the president be able to make a decision that effects this many people and this many dollars?  Let\u2019s have a conversation as a country about free education (the fed pays the bills with my taxes).\n\n2.  The problem is that universities have been continuing to raise tuition costs and bloat their staffs.  I worked briefly at my grad school, the profs made nothing.  So where is all that tuition going?  Let\u2019s solve this problem.\n\n3.  I assume canceling debt means the fed will pay the loan makers.  These companies are giving 6 digit loans to 18 year old kids with their families co-sign.  So tuition continues to go up, banks prey on students, and with a pen stroke none of these problems are fixed.\n\nUltimately I think the US is doomed because our leadership doesn\u2019t care about us citizens.

Just like how the American people have a debt problem so does the American government.  \n\nI look through all of the people here incorrectly seeing it as an argument of spite.  When in reality we are talking billions of dollars of debt given out by the government.  The same government that is in the middle of a budgeting issue and is on the verge of yet another partial government shutdown.  Everyone wants the government to fix all of their issues, but what they\u2019re too stupid to realize is their problems can\u2019t be fixed for free.  \n\nSo let\u2019s rephrase the issue.  The issue isn\u2019t that people are upset that the president is \u201ccancelling\u201d or \u201cforgiving\u201d debt.  It\u2019s that if he does it, then everyone else in the country will now shoulder that debt.  It doesn\u2019t just disappear.  The money is still a portion of the massive budget deficit.  And instead of the well educated portion of the society shouldering the debt it will be the less educated working class.",

Then your company tells Timmy you don't have to pay the loan back dont worry about it. That is literally what student loan forgiveness crap is. \n\nI have fraudulent student loans taken out in my name from 12 years ago I have been fighting to this day.

            "Anyone that doesn't understand doesn't know how economics work and needs to do some serious learning. Ignorance of how things contribute to inflation, and eventual economic collapse, is the reason it keeps happening. Free handouts by the government, to anyone at all, is not money that just comes out of nowhere. When we overspend beyond what our tax revenue is, it adds to national debt and decreases the value of the national currency. Then we end up with the mess we're in now, where jobs are paying more but the cost of regular groceries has increased at an even higher ratio than wages. \n\nIt's not just student loans and the education system, those have always been an issue. The real problem is all the people that blindly go to college and spend tens of thousands, if not over a hundred thousand, for a piece of paper without any guarantee of a return on the investment. We don't teach real future planning to our youth, we just drive it into their heads that they have to go to college right after high school if they want to be successful. If you don't have the means to pay for college upfront, or a guarantee of a good salary afterwards, don't go to college yet. It's that simple. If more people understood this and we stopped flooding universities with all this money we don't have, they'll eventually be forced to reform the structure.",

            "Because the \"forgiveness\" is just the government paying the loans. And the government is funded by people who pay taxes. So the person who took out the loan gets a degree, and the rest of America gets to pay for it. That's why people are upset about it.",

            "Let's cover the topic of \"This emboldens colleges to hike tuition, so student loan forgiveness=bad\". \n\nYes, it does, but it also doesn't.  \nColleges, yes, would hike prices, but, due to the decline in childbirth amongst millennials, colleges are on a ticking time bomb of default. \nThey won't be able to rely on the numbers there once were, so they will have to acquiesce to creating a curriculum and process that generates an  actual outcome for students at some point, or close their doors.\n\nThe younger generations are much wore wary of student loans, as they have seen a college degree isn't necessarily a ticket to the middle class as previously thought.\n\nAdditionally, due to Alumni being a source of income for colleges, it results in a downward spiral effect over time as less and less people (and their children)go to colleges.\n\nSo my point is, allow the 20k student  loan forgiveness, or half the general average debt holders are paying. Whichever is palatable. \n\n\nTL;DR: Allow it. Student loan forgiveness on the universal level won't happen again, because the conditions that made for colleges to hike tuition in the first place simply are not at play anymore and never will be.",

We have a Constitution that created three government branches with limited powers.  The President, created under Article II does not have the power to spend money.  That power belongs solely to the House of Representatives under Article I.   The Supreme Court does not have the power to create a new right.  That is a power that is reserved to the states and the people under Article IV.  \n\nUnfortunately, there is a view of the law held by President Obama and his side called Critical Legal Theory which states that the Constitution is a racist document and it should be ignored if it gets in the way of the Progressive agenda.  Obama stated this when he said that I don't need Congress I have a pen and a telephone.  As such, they want a President who will have all the power to do what is needed to be done, and the people be dammed. \n\nWell, I am sorry, we have to look to the Constitution.  If you want student debt forgiven, then that is spending money so you have to go to Congress and ask them to pass a bill.  If you want a national right to an abortion, you need to get a Constitutional Amendment passed.   That is a very messy, slow process, but if you give too much power to the President and the Supreme Court, you would not like that if it was wielded by a President that you don't like.",

This was Feb 2004-August 2005.\nThings I developed:\nIraq invasion photos, gore, death, et al.\n\nBeautiful 20 something woman, told me up front there were nudes, said if I developed them, I could look.  She got her photos in record time.\n\nIndian couple's honeymoon, they got me king size Reeses peanut butter cups to develop and not look.  OK done.\n\nOld lady brought in disposable, said nothing.  Turns out it was horrific abuse of all kinds on a little girl.  I called police.  She came in that same night to pick them up.  Soon as she paid, they Chris Hansened her ass and arrested her.  That shit fucked me up.  One image is seared into my mind and I wish it would just go away but it was pure evil, the most horrific thing I've ever seen.  You don't want to know.  It's a burden. \n\nThat's it.",
            "My buddy developed photos for his job in the 90s.  He had some copies of some pretty good stuff.  Sexy stuff yes, gross stuff yes, but our favorite was just a picture of a 70-something year old man, sitting on a toilet, taking a monster rip from a giant glass bong",
            "They still do! When I was at art school a few years ago, there was a little photography shop across the street where we would all take our film to be developed if we didn't want to do it ourselves. It was considered common courtesy to go pick up your classmates' pictures, no questions asked, when they didn't want to look the guy in the face.",
            "I worked at a grocery store with a film lab during this time. The lead developer had a lot of pictures of some shit. (I know it\u2019s illegal and creepy to boot) he had images ranging from neat double exposures and well-taken landscapes to people shoving a two-liter bottle in their asses. He would make extras of anything he found intriguing. It was always fun to show some of us a reel of what was some sort of key party or swingers night. And later, we would see the mom of two come to pick up her film. Even more, fun when he would have to tell them he couldn\u2019t develop them(or some) because it showed penetration",
            "Yes they did! This is how I ended up taking the stand and my aunt ended up in prison!",
            "Yep they sure did. Went tubing on the apple river one year, 20 years or so ago (wisconees and Minnesotans know what I'm talking about) the group of girls that were with us, all went down the river topless. Well we were all taking pics and I had a friend who worked at the film store where they developed them and at first she brought me the pics without those ones developed. I said are you sure there aren't some missing? She then developed the rest with no issue. So I think maybe the policy was they wouldn't unless you asked?",
            "Worked at Ritz Camera in 2001. Developed and color corrected all film on a huge Fugi development machine. Tons of nudes. Many were picked up by people who wore sunglasses inside (as if that mattered by the time we printed them). \n\nWe were also under strict orders to call the cops if we saw anyone that looked like a minor. Thankfully, I never saw any child stuff. Just lots of ugly ass adults in weird rooms and in weird situations.",

            "Yes.\n\nI'm a Sysadmin in a Photo Ptinting company and yes. While the developing takes places in the dark, the pictures are rolled onto big rolls and then cut where people can see them.\n\nWe used to have a closed bin full of illegal photos (cp, nazi stuff, the usual) bc people apparently though no one would see that. So yeah. Naked stuff aint the weirdest shit people see there",
            "Quick story - Navy deployment in 2001. Dumbass new guy (me) his camera on the table in Panama. Return to the USA and get my pictures developed months later. All dicks. Everyone at the table took a picture of their junk. Picked that shit up from Rite Aid with all my other rolls of film. Got a weird fucking look. The only one I could definitely blame and identify was the one black guy.",
            "Worked at CVS. Yes. Not on purpose. We had a pad of notes to put in if it was sexual after developing the film and seeing it on the scanner explaining why we didn\u2019t print it (if we caught it on there) but lots would just print whatever not giving a shit",
            "25ish years ago I worked in a plant that did overnight processing. We saw everything. Police evidence photos, nudes, coroner pics, lots of topless fat ladies leaning on trans ams. There was a guy who, once a month or so, would send in multiple rolls of pics of himself inserting garage tools in his anus. Fun stuff.",

            "Yup. Worked at several \u201c1 HR Photos\u201d people would sometimes drop them off. You could see when the negatives were developed. This must be done before you could make prints. But most of the time people would \u201csend them out\u201d and they would take a few days.",
            "Yes, I worked as a student in a University photo lab.  I was told to take the inappropriate photos of the cheerleaders out of the negatives book that the creepy old man photographer would take.  Sketchy as fuck job all for $6 an hour",
            "Yes.\n\nWe had to report anything that seemed inappropriate, like if there were children. Officially we didn't print porn but could print it if it was \"art.\" That meant it was up to whoever developed the film. Some wouldn't print anything nude.\n\nSometimes you'd get the guys who would take a picture of their junk so that they could ask you about it when they came in to get the pictures. I'd usually print anything relatively tame, and tell the guys that you couldn't see anything in the \"shock\" photos. They were usually disappointed. You could also cut it out of the film or ruin it so that they couldn't try to reprint it.\n\nThe childbirth photos were the ones I was usually bothered by the most when I wasn't warned. I always printed it but I've never understood who would want to keep that image of themselves.\n\nI never had anything too graphic. Probably because it was face to face.",

            "I worked at a store that had a photo lab. They kept a book of best photos that they developed.",
            "I worked at CVS in high school and part of my job was developing photos. We had to check each photo to make sure it printed properly, then cut the negatives. The number of compromising and otherwise awkward photos I saw was astonishing. Making eye contact with the person picking up the photos was interesting to say the least.",
            "I took many topless photos way back when and gave no fucks who saw them. Them there were 20 year old boobies.",
            "My nudes were missing when I got holiday photos developed about 2 years ago. I went back with the negatives and got them the 2nd time. What gives, Max Spielmann?",

            "I recall a story where some parents had a pic of themselves giving their newborn a bath. The dad too a cute pic kissing the babies bottom. \nThe store employee turned it in to the police, and they had the baby taken away. It took several months for the case to be dismissed. So yes, they often do check the photos.",
            "I use to work at Walgreens as a cashier. The photo guy would run over to me to show me women\u2019s frisky photos that are getting printed out. Lol. Funny",
            "Waaaay late to the party. Used to run a wet lab for 35mm film developing and printing. \n\nThe answer, yes, we saw everything. It wasn't uncommon to stumble across nudes, a lot of the time it was from summer vacations, or similar occasions.\n\nWe did have a regular who would get 35mm developed, which was an entire roll of (very unappealing) nudes in rather suggestive positions. She would give them to her \"friends\" in prison. \n\nThe only time we would not proceed with development and printing is when there was illegal acts in the photos, which in terms of nudity, did happen occasionally. These people were often reported to the police."

I think many religious people feel this way, that god tests them not to try to catch them slacking but to let them exercise their \"gift of free will\" and relish the fact that, despite being able to choose a sinful path, they chose the right thing. It doesn't matter if the future is planned out, it's not about being tested, it's about actively practicing your faith during tough times and trying to get something out of it.\n\nNow I don't really believe in that kind of a god but I guess that line of reasoning still makes sense to me.\n\nedit: most of the athiests responding to this comment are more toxic than the vast majority of christains i've met.

Free will is a big part of the Bible and its stories. Your choices make you who you are. It's more that sometimes I feel like I'm getting a kick up the ass from the universe if I'm missing obvious signs that something will make me happy to do but it's still my choice whether or not to do it or find happiness elsewhere.\n\nBut my exact religious beliefs have been in a state of flux for some time now.

How do we know God didn\u2019t have a heart attack eons ago?\nAfter being scolded for implying God was dead and forced to say many a prayer, I had questions. \nAnyways when I\u2019m asked today if I\u2019m religious I always give the same reply.

Could a parent do everything for their child? Yes. But if they did, they'd be doing their children a disservice. In the same way, God allows people to go through trials without getting rid of the trial. It builds resolve but more importantly, faith in him.\n\nSome people disagree with that and it turns them away from God. Others see it as faith strengthening. You can be on either side of that, but factually the Bible doesn't tell us that God has planned our lives out.",

So then it follows, if God knows everything, past, present, and future, he would know who is and is not \"going to hell\" before he ever created them.  AND if we don't have free will, those that go to Heaven and those that go to Hell, will have no choice in the matter.\n\nWe are fated to do whatever we do and if that means some of us were fated to suffer the worst pain imaginable for ETERNITY, that would not be the work of a loving God.  That would be the work of a MONSTER that no person on earth, no matter how evil, could compare to.\n\nAnd THIS is the God Christians worship, using a book that promotes slavery and misogyny, and describes acts of genocide, bestiality, and incest.\n\nLuckily, I think we are witnessing the fall of religions right now.

OF COURSE, we would discover new information that we got wrong centuries ago.  It's just another example of why the Bible is simply a  historical collection of documents, and although it contains records of real towns and cities of the past, it cannot be used as a literal accurate account of events and people.\n\nWhen you break it down to that, it seems CRAZY that that same book is being followed, often literally, by groups of people today.  But we aren't talking about a small, weird group, were talking this thing is believed by a LARGE part of the world.  Cities have burned, people have been executed, wars have been started, all over an old work of fiction.\n\nIt would be like a LARGE group of people, in 2023, were using the stories of Homer's The Odyssey to guide every part of their lives.

Is it the free will of bacteria that is causing this evil to happen every single year? It's like the death counts of the tsunami of 2004 in Asia... happening every 10 days, only to children under 5. \n\nSo many times we see privilieged people living in good standards, claiming that god is good.

The literal first story in the bible involves Adam and Eve violating the rules of the garden and being punished for it.

He still doesn't know which specific future we will end up on, but he knows how it will end. So based on this he does have a plan for your life that could probably be very very good.

Testing faith just to test it is NOT just.\n\nThe whole predestination vs. free will thing, I think I have covered. To me, a creator has to have completed ALL creation (from beginning to end... since time would also be part of that construct) for it to be a true omnipotent/omniscient/omnipresent being. Dr. Manhattan (of Watchmen) was an example of this in literature, where he knew his whole story, and since that comic's creation, DC has screwed him up and brought him back to Earth. They missed the point of him departing. It was always going to happen that way, and he knew it. So, just because you can fill in all the bubbles on a test doesn't mean you determine every question/answer on the test, right?\n\nThese questions bring up in me the whole \"if we pray about it, God will do it for us\" mentality.\n\nThere is a good story/joke/whatever floating around that puts it pretty succinctly.\n\nThe teller is on a boat that crashes (like the Titanic) and prays for salvation. A moment later, a piece of wood (we'll say Rose's door from the Titanic) floats by. The teller doesn't grab it, believing God will save them. Next comes a life saver. Teller still doesn't take it because God will save them. Then a life vest. Then a life boat. Then, finally, a rescue ship is there. Teller refuses, saying God will save them and promptly drowns. When confronted in the afterlife, Teller asks God why they weren't saved. God mentions the wood, the life saver, the life vest, the dinghy, and the ship, all there to save the Teller, and God asks if they needed a neon sign to reach for the nearest thing that could save them.\n\nThat's the closest thing to \"testing\" my mind can wrap around that a creator (who is just) would ever do to its creation.

            "There's an actual, specific answer regarding some of these laws. I'm surprised it isn't in this thread. Many of these specific laws are being passed because the US Supreme Court did not strike down t[his texas law banning abortions after 6 weeks](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/texas-abortion-lawsuit/2021/07/13/e0cee10c-e33c-11eb-b722-89ea0dde7771_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_1). The reason this specific law is so influential is that it uses a novel enforcement mechanism: enabling private citizens to sue one another, rather than the state. The law was designed this way specifically to avoid an outright block by the supreme court. \n\nWe often say that the supreme court \"strikes down\" a law but that's not really what they do. What they actually do is prevent the government from enforcing it. The texas law relies on the interpretation that, because it's a private citizen (and not a govt. official) suing someone, the supreme court cannot do anything about it.\n\nSince the majority of the court appeared to accept that logic, conservative states are rushing to pass bills enabling effective discrimination against other minorities using that same enforcement mechanism (private lawsuits). Florida's \"Don't Say Gay Bill\" is one example.",

Even if/when the laws get struck down in courts because they are patently ridiculous, the politicians can still twist that to their favor by saying things like \u2018the other side is against us, we need to get our guys in the courts too so that we can make (state) great again!\u2019 Since trump is the most likely candidate at this point, they are really trying hard to out-trump trump to stifle his chances of gaining momentum. Their hope is that, again, if they can get that radical base that loves trump, everyone else in the party will just fall in line behind them to vote \u2018anyone but Biden.\u2019 Remember, in 2016 nobody thought trump had a chance, but he activated all these people hard and fast, and they were very loyal to him. I\u2019d argue that the \u2018anyone but (candidate)\u2019 vote is what made the difference both in 2016 to elect trump and in 2020 to elect Biden.

If you don\u2019t vote for me, the evil could prevail.\u2019\n\nThese laws are just PR for these politicians to see how many trump supporters they have and how eager they are to ditch trump for someone that\u2019s actually \u2018in power\u2019 while trump is weak.",

Before the liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died, conservatives had a 5-4 advantage but the conservative Chief Justice believes in precedent and wanting to project a Court as being non-partisan. Because of this he voted with the liberals on some (but not nearly all) of the hot button issues facing the Court. Ginsburg was replaced by the very Christian conservative Amy Coney Barrett.

The most convincing answer for this question regarding honeybees comes from JillandherHills, who says that 6,351,111 honey bees could fit into the interior space of a Lexus. Smug as I am about my victory, my father feels slightly nettled being so far off from his estimate for a honeybee, and I doubt the fact that the smallest bee in the world is still a little less than five million away from just 1 billion is any consolation. My brother has begun to reevaluate his concept of a trillion, though he\u2019s nine so I\u2019ll give him some leeway for being so far off.

Its like your family tearing apart over whether or not bread was invented by God or Humans.\n\nNot say that makes you guys stupid or ill or something...just trying to say that it might be worth your time to let it go and then pay attention to other areas of life where this trend shows up.\n\nMany people have a hard time handling tough meta social situations (covid) and will turn to things that are pointless to distract themselves from the uncomfortability that is truth tearing everything they once knew apart. Pretty sure everyone is doing this right now...I have caught myself debating over pointless stuff too...fun in the moment but when there is emotional charge on things that don't matter, to me its a sign that there are emotions to figure out together about the stuff that does matter.

I know this because my wife is a therapist and this is not a diagnosis since I am not certified to help with mental health, just a friendly observation that I learned from someone who is because they revealed that insight within me when I was focusing on games to distract from productivity and then found myself playing sim/management games (productivity energy) and wondered why it wasn't feeling right...it was because I was suppressing the productivity blocks and the universe was like...nah, learn that through games.\n\nBest of luck friend, if anything know that this will be a funny story later despite how horrible it feels now. Your family will soon see that there is no point in arguing over trivial and subjective matters when there is so to resolve in stuff that does matter.

Try to block all distractions beforehand; \n\n* if its web-related you have some Addons that block you from accessing certain websites for a certain amount of time. \n* turn off your phone \n* notify people around you that you will be busy from <insert time range>\n* grab enough drinks and food\n* Set a bare minimum amount of time to work on it \\[see explanation below\\]\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBest advise I ever got was actually from an AMA by Terry Crews on going to the gym; \n\n> *Go to the gym, don't even work out. Just GO. Because the habit of going to the gym is more important than the work out. Because it doesn't matter what you do. You can have fun - but as long as you're having fun, you continue to do it.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow every tuesday and thursday when I get home I work out for 5 minutes.

This lack of agency in your life makes you depressed and you soothe yourself with distractions.

That could take the form of being kinder to yourself and allowing yourself to take your time, removing yourself from external pressures you can't control like an unreasonable boss, examining internal pressures you put on yourself, or managing your emotions surrounding the things you need or want to do. Usually it is a combination of these and other personalized solutions--unless you've nailed down the exact one thing the above solutions easily mask more helpful approaches. In fact procrastinating itself is one solution, it's just that the typical sources of external and internal pressure aren't relieved by it and it becomes a maladaptive one-size-fits-all solution.",

While many people start feeling tired at night, there are others who start feeling creative.

            "This will probably get buried, but in the practice of Ayurveda (5000-year-old Indian science of life), the day is broken down into three types of \u201cenergy\u201d, and each energy has various properties. One is creative and uplifting, one is for work and concentration, and one is for transformation and general processing. These also take on additional characteristics when sleeping (think: the different dream cycles). \n\nThe time periods tend to break down like this (accounting for variations depending on the hemisphere you live in, and my wildly generalized summary):\n\n6am-10am: work\n\n10am-2pm: transform**\n\n2pm-6pm: create\n\n6pm-10pm: work/winding down\n\n10pm-2am: transform/recover**\n\n2am-6am: create/rejuvenate\n\n\nYou\u2019ll noticed the starred ones: when you find yourself awake after 10pm, and are bursting with all this energy, it\u2019s a result of this cycle being inverted between day and night. During this block of time, your body is assuming the same type of energy it would during lunch: the sun is at its highest, you\u2019re ready to fuel up for the heaviest meal of the day, and you\u2019re getting ready for the big push of creative energy coming between 2pm and 6pm. \n\nOf course, these things can get out of whack, and if you find yourself in that position, there\u2019s no need to stress. The body is constantly attempting to self-regulate, and it will tell you when it needs it. So, if you\u2019re finding yourself awake at odd hours, see what you can do with it: prepare for the next day\u2019s work, read, learn a new skill, go for a walk; mainly just live your life. Maybe avoid caffeine for a few days, and notice when you feel tired, and when you don\u2019t. Before long, things should start to shift back into a more standard rhythm.\n\nGranted, workdays can interfere with this, so these suggestions may not work for you, but hopefully this gives you a bit of a start towards understanding your own rhythms a little better :)\n\nEdit: formatting",

Circadian drive for arousal however, is highest during the evening and occurs in waves over 24 hours, highest in evening, lowest in morning. It is thought to be an advantage to be highest in the evening as tiredness during night increases risks of accidents (one theory is as apes we had to build nests and climb trees etc. which requires a certain level of alertness).

            "I've experienced this for... Pretty much my entire life lol. I think it's pretty common, especially for young people. I've read something in the past about people ages 13-25, so basically teens and young adults, require more sleep than older adults and their circadian rhythms are programmed to be more alert in the evening. That's why most teens stay up late and struggle to get up early for school.\n\n  \n\n\nThere's an explanation for my own personal issue as well, but I'm an uncommon case. I have narcolepsy and delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS) so not only do I feel tired more often and require more sleep than the average person, but my circadian rhythm is shifted to the point where it's essentially backwards. I'm awake during the evening/night and asleep (or very tired) during the morning/afternoon. My optimal schedule is to go to sleep around 5-6am (basically at dawn) and wake up around 3-6pm (I need 10-12 hrs of sleep). This makes me feel really unmotivated during the day and I'll procrastinate everything until evening, when suddenly I feel super alert and ready to tackle the day... Except often it's too late to get anything done by then lol.\n\n  \n\n\nMy neurologist suggested that I take melatonin every night around the time that I want my brain to get sleepy, so I take it around 3am, fall asleep around 4am once it kicks in, then I'll wake up naturally around 12-2pm. If I do this every day it helps keep my brain on the right schedule by fixing my circadian rhythm. That's about the best I can do since it's impossible for me to fall asleep or wake up any earlier. \n\n  \n\n\nThis method might work for other people who want to fix their sleep schedule, so it might be worth trying. Just take melatonin (you only need a small amount btw like 2-3mg for a single dose, even though most supplements come in really high doses) at night about an hour before you want to go to sleep. Also reduce the amount of blue light for 2-3 hours before bedtime. TV and computer screens, phones, etc all give off blue light which inhibits melatonin and is one of the most common causes for trouble sleeping at night. You can get apps and software to filter out blue light at night - most even have automatic schedules based on sunrise/sunset times.\n\nGetting to sleep at the right time, and getting GOOD sleep, is really important for your physical and mental health. It could be the reason why so many people feel sluggish and even depressed during the day, but awake and alert at night. Circadian rhythm is also connected to metabolism and hormone regulation, so if your diet is really bad, or you have health issues, the could be a factor as well.",

Somewhere in Virginia we stop at a rest stop to stretch our legs and park where all the other tractor trailers were. We started talking to the guy parked next to us. We realized we were going in the same direction as him and a couple other trucks that had formed a convoy. He told us we should join for a bit. My buddy and I were very excited to join a trucker convoy. We all depart the rest stop, with us bringing up the rear. The convoy gets up to speed. Our truck was governed at 65.

When I got off the interstate  I-4, I noticed a semi- truck behind me which had also pulled off. I had seen him pass me when I had merged unto the highway.  It was early morning and this same truck pulled off at a 7-Eleven.  Not unusual as it was about 7:00 am and people were getting breakfast. Continued down the road which was Hwy 46..  He was behind me.  Then went on another road where there were 4 lanes Hwy 441..  He would pass me, I would pass him. About six miles from my destination, I pulled off to go into a store to get some snacks.  The trucker did the same. It was about 8:00 am.  This didn't alarm or frighten me as when I looked at the trucker, he seemed to be non-threatening and I didn't get a bad vibe from him.  \n\nWhile we were in line, he chatted a bit. We laughed that we were following each other.  He was heading north to Ocala so when I turned off, I waved at him and he honked his horn and waved as he continued towards Ocala to go to the trucking company he worked for as he had to be there by 9:00 am.   In all my travels, I have never experienced this.  That day I thought about this guy.\n\nThis happened sometime in 2016 or 2017.  I have from time to time thought about this guy.",

And they have some other stickers. After studying the stickers we came to the conclusion that there was a son and daughter in the family. The daughter likes ballet and the son plays soccer. One or both of them went to a certain elementary school, and the dad likes deep sea fishing.\n\nWe pieced together a lot of the Garcia's life from their bumper stickers, and made up some more in our minds too.

Maybe 30 min later we see them pulled over and the blanket was burned, still smoking. I gave a hearty \u201cI knew it!\u201d as we passed them.

The first 3 hours, a few cars here and there became my short-term buddies and they would eventually veer off. On hour 3, I pulled into a rest stop and when I pulled out, another car was also leaving in the same direction. For context, I have a radar that tells me if a potential cop is ahead or behind. As we were speeding along, my radar went off and I immediately slowed down until I reached the speed limit. At this point, the other car was a bit ahead until I noticed they also slowed down enough that we were driving side by side. I remember there was a cop a mile ahead after they slowed down. I'm pretty sure we both realized we each had a radar and became buddies. They would pass me, I would pass them, we both would slow down when needed(lol) but we stuck together for about 2.5 hours. About 30 min before I reached my destination, my buddy indicated they were getting off a few exits before me. We both slowed and drove side by side one last time and when the time came, we honked our horns and flashed our lights. \n\n\n\nI think about them from time to time.",

Next thing you know, the first one then passes the former second vehicle in turn. Not to be out-done and not wanting to revert back to the former status quo, the original second vehicle again passes the first one.

We notice he has a bumper sticker, we think it says \"give me soul, give me life.\"  Not being Christian, we both kind of assume he is a Christian, perhaps a preacher. We turn up our music and continue rocking on. \n\nWe continue driving on and we notice he is giving us some sort of gesture. At first we think he's giving us the finger. We decide to pull up closer and start tailgating him. We notice his bumper sticker actually says \"give me fuel, give me fire\" a Metallica song. He isn't giving us the finger, he was holding up his hand in typical rocker fashion. He was on his way to the concert. Awesome. We play our music louder and head bang in unison. We lose each other in traffic. \n\nOnce we arrive at the concert we park and head to get in the long line for entry. Guess who is way ahead in line? Traffic buddy!  He calls out to us and says he saved us a spot in line. We get in with him and mosh the entire concert together. We ended up meeting up with him and his girlfriend at several concerts since. It was pretty awesome.",

We shouldn't have been driving like that but we had a *huge* incentive to get somewhere by 6pm. (Thankfully we did manage to pull it off safely and caused no incidents.) We were trying not to miss a ferry, and eventually we pulled onto the entry ramp with about 60 seconds to spare, taking up the next-to-last spot. Just as we heard the warning alarm that the ramp was about to be taken up, that other car magically appeared over the ramp and zipped into the last spot. He was a local (we were tourists) and as the ferry got underway, he found us and cheerily congratulated us on our driving \"victory\" with obvious delight. We still talk about that guy and how impressed he was that we could drive like the locals.",

So many cars were passing me going over the speed limit so I thought, you know what I'll wait until another car comes to pass me and just stay at their pace (in my mind it could lower the chances of getting a speeding ticket). So this car comes and I speed up and follow at their pace. We had gone through 3 states and it was great. Literally hours together. But I was running out of gas and had to pull over at the next gas station and was super disappointed I wouldn't have my travel buddy anymore. But then as I see the exit to the gas station the car also puts on their blinkers! I though oh cool they are getting gas too, I can go say hi and thank them for giving me the confidence to speed! So we both park and I get out. My buddy car person gets out and its this lady. And she is looking at me terrified and starts running into the gas station constantly looking back at me.... \n\nI was so embarrassed. For me it was such a wholesome experience. I didn't even think to put it in the perspective of her, having this car follow her for hours. I'm sorry lady wherever you are.

We stayed relative to this duo for about two hours. They'd maintain a sort of show by constantly passing each other, speeding up and slowing down. All of us in my mom's car found this very amusing. Dr Love would pull ahead through the hills but, Geo Metro stole it all on the flats. It should go without saying that Geo Metro meant to leave it all on the asphalt.

We met on I-90 almost after I merged and stayed together until my exit on the other side of NYS, maybe travelled together 10 hours.  I stopped at least once for fuel but caught up. We honked and waved at my exit. It was the strangest thing but it made me smile. I hated the long drives but flying wasn\u2019t economical for me at the time. I haven\u2019t thought of this in years. Thanks for the trip down memory lane.",
            "Yea, from new haven CT into RI I made the trip every week for 2 years and the same couple of cars were moving that late.  We met up once when there was a crash.  We pulled guy and his dog out.  Exchanged words and oddly never met up or talked again.",

            "Worst drive of my entire life - it's early February in Canada, it's been snowing all day, and it's now pitch dark at 7pm. I have a half hour drive down rural country highways to get home from work. None of the roads have been plowed (focused on major expressways), and the wind is blowing snow. Visibility was horrible. \n\nI'm in my little Ford focus clutching onto the wheel like it's somehow going to help. I was mostly alone on the roads, then like a merciful angel, I see it: a huge grey SUV in front of me on the road. I get behind it and hold on tight, and prayed that they didnt turn off. I was able to follow them until we got to a busier section that had already been plowed, then they turned left and I turned right. \n\nUp until that point, I had been mentally calculating what the fuck I would do if my car went off the road. I had my winter gear with me, so I wouldn't freeze, but I knew it would be at minimum 2 hours before I could get a tow (and that's only if someone with a tow wasn't moon-lighting as a plow, as they tend to do in heavy storms).",
            "One time it was me and this Suv driving through the flat land of Missouri and we stayed the same distance apart (20 yards) for well over an hour, and there was no one else around. We must have had our cruise controls set on the exact same speed. It was pretty cool",
            "Yes had it recently on an 8 hour trip, some cars hang on to you if your driving there same style / speed",
            "Yup, and then take turns leading while going over the speed limit. (Not that I've done this)",

            "For sure. I once got stuck in a terrible snowstorm on the highway. I couldn't see more than a couple feet in front  of me, save for the tail lights of one car.  If I didn't move, I would create havock for anyone who might be behind me. I couldn't even see how to get off the highway. So, I followed those tail lights for hours, until we finally crept out of the storm. I had my one-month-old baby in my car, and I was white-knuckling that steering wheel the entire time.   \nI credit that car in front of me with getting us out of there safely. Once things cleared, I gave him air high fives and he returned them. What a team player.",
            "This post is crazy to me because I got back from a road trip yesterday and had a road trip buddy for at least an hour or more. We suck together through Arkansas, I exited to get gas, saw them wave but couldn't wave back in time :-(",

            "Oh absolutely. But my favorite is when I'm going 5 over, I pass someone and pull off to a gas station like 30 minutes after passing them. If I time it right I'll be able to get on the highway and catch up to them. It's what inspires me not to speed on the highway. 5 over is just so I don't get fucked with",
            "Yes, all the time! Not just road trips, but when I'm in heavy commuter traffic I try to find a buddy who doesn't use their brake unnecessarily. It makes the slow drive less stressful, and I can maintain speed",
            "I\u2019ll wave goodbye to them, sometimes I feel like they know, we shared a bond of slowly passing each other at 5 over speed limit, cruise control being .5mph faster than the other over hundreds of miles. \n\nThose, and the ones who are speeding like bad, I\u2019ll put a good mile between us but that\u2019s a rabbit to chase. They\u2019re there to let you know if cops are out.",

I had been driving this truck for a couple years and I noticed that I could get between 17.2 and 17.8 MPG whether I drove like an asshole or a granny. I figured a several hour drive trying to follow semis might show difference.\n\nI desperately needed to stop for a pee but this truck was apparently going the exact same way that I was and we went all the way to Chicago. Same route the whole way.\n\n Got 17.8.",

            "When I was driving from Kansas to Minnesota, the final 3 or so hours of my drive were the absolute worst fog I've ever driven in, at night. I had to drive half the speed limit. I tailed cars on and off for a while, mostly driving alone, until a semi entered my lane from a ramp. He was barrelling down the road at 10 over, tons of bright red lights on his trailer, and he clearly knew what he was doing. You know damn well I decided to shorten my drive by an hour and just trail him hard. I spent an extra hour having to piss and holding it in because my beacon of light was helping my trip so much. Once I was about 30min from my destination and the fog started to clear, I spoke a verbal goodbye to nobody, and pulled over to finally relieve myself. \n\nThat truck driver is a deity in my eyes.

That would probably come across as super creepy, right?\n\nIn the end I slowly drove past and had a lonely drive the rest of the way home.

            "It always hits ONE MORE TIME as I am *juuuuuust* about to fall asleep. Pre bed pee- one more pee, then just about to fall asleep pee, and the 2 hrs before I need to wake up pee. I drink a metric fuckton of water but it is still so irritating",
            "I pee most of my pee at night it\u2019s so weird. I swear I pee like 3-4 times at night and I can\u2019t sleep unless I pee.",

            "When did nsq turn into dae? Also yes...",
            "Yes. You can train your bladder. If you always pee before going to sleep, it will send signals that you need to pee before you go to sleep even if it\u2019s not full. One reason why when potty training it\u2019s not a good idea to make your kid go every hour whether they need to or not- you could train their bladder to go more frequently than actually necessary. In general I pee a lot, so I\u2019ve looked into this stuff. My bladder isn\u2019t \u201csmall\u201d or \u201coveractive\u201d it just fills quickly. When I need to drink fluids for a test (like an ultrasound) I don\u2019t need to drink as much or as long before the test that they say to.",

            "Some people tend toward edema, i.e. the body holding water in the tissues. It's the same thing that can sometimes make your ankles swell up. After you lie down, this excess fluid goes to the kidneys and then you have to pee. If you think this might be happening to you, there are various things you can do to treat the edema. For example you can take a diuretic herb (such as dandelion) earlier in the day or early evening, well before bedtime. Some people recommend a nap during the day, with legs up. You may wish to research further if you feel like you might have this condition.",
            "I always have to piss no matter what half way through my sleep. Sometimes im able to sleep through it but it happens nearly every night and it sucks to wake up after 4 hours and have to piss then try to get back to sleep for another 4 hours",

            "I have a hard time breathing through my nose. I recently learned that it gives me anxiety in my sleep and has been causing an urge to pee every two hours. Iv had this problem since I was 20, 30  now. Any good ideas for someone without insurance or thousands of dollars?",

            "I actually looked this up recently wondering why:\n\nWhen you\u00a0lie down\u00a0at night it becomes easier for the circulatory system to work. The fluid is absorbed back into your blood and filtered out through the kidneys, which then send it to the bladder as\u00a0urine. This means that your bladder fills as you sleep much\u00a0more\u00a0quickly than it normally\u00a0would.",
            "It's so annoying. I swear I'll play video games for hours on end and be fine before I get in bed. Then after I already piss and then try to go to sleep I have to piss again.",
            "No",
            "I definitely don't hydrate as much as I should, thus I don't pee a ton during the day. But right when I jump in bed, I gotta pee 3-5 before actually falling asleep. I still refuse to accept this and continue getting really pissy about it",
            "Yeah. Me nan.",

            "Yes, and it starts when you are really into getting to sleep, so the thought goes like \"I wanna sleep, but I can't sleep, because I have to piss\" ....",

            "Yes.  Also, it doesn't matter if I pee'd five minutes prior to leaving the house, I still need to go again RIGHT before I leave.",
            "For me I can tell that any fluid retention I\u2019ve accumulated from being upright throughout the day which is stuck in my lower body makes it\u2019s way to my bladder once I\u2019ve been laying down for a bit. So even if I pee once I\u2019ll need to pee again soon.",
            "ALL the time. So annoying",
            "I just asked why I do this to myself yesterday I think it comes from anxiety that you will pee yourself at night , at least I believe this for me",
