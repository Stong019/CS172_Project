            "I just wanted to comment on this with a story that I always remember.  The day before I was to start 5th grade my closest grandmother had passed away.  Needless to say I missed the first two days of school and that was it.  At the end of the school year they did the rewarding ceremony for those who never missed a day and it was a trip to the movies.  All of my friends were going as they had not missed a day, but I already knew I wasn't because of my first 2 days of absence.  This crushed 5th grade me.  The teachers were giving out the permission slips to have our parents sign so they knew their children were going to the movies.  I will never forget this but my teacher stopped at my desk and gave me one.  Being the good two shoes I was I told her I had missed two days.  Her response is still with me to this day (I am a college graduate now): \"Your school year didn't start until you came in the third day, so you technically have not missed a day of school.\".  Her kindness to me has never been forgotten and it made my day.  Sorry for the random story.",

            "I'm not American, but attendance is one way to assess a child's health.   At-risk kids are often absent from school for reasons beyond their control.   I'm Canadian, and I've never seen a perfect attendance award. An abnormal amount of missed days often triggers an investigation by the school or Children's Aid.  When my daughter had cancer in grade 4 (even though the school knew about it) we had a visit with the school board because of all of her absences. \n\nAs far as I know, attendance awards are mostly due to parenting, not the kids.  It's an appalling way to judge child health or learning.  But I think that schools in the U.S. often rely on funding depending on attendance, so it is what it is. \n\n",
            "My wife is a teacher and here's what she has to say...\n\nMany students come from families where education isn't seen as very important.  Many parents \"forget\" to drop their kids off, don't come to conferences, etc. Having a reward for good attendance is a way to help those children encourage their parents to bring them to school.  It's not seen as a\"come to school when you're sick\" type of situation but rather a \"see how important education is - you should make your best effort to come\"",
            "[Chronic absence can have a significant negative effect on student performance](http://absencesaddup.org/importance-of-school-attendance/). Obviously you want to avoid that because if you start out at a disadvantage early on it can have consequences throughout your life. \n\nHowever, its well known that trying to present nuanced or subtle distinctions is harder than presenting broad absolutes when it comes to messaging. If you present a moderated version of a message, you need to make sure that your recipient acknowledges and agrees with your message AND that they make the appropriare judgement on the degree to which they apply that moderation.\n\nSo its much easier to tell kids \"come to school everyday\" than it is to say \"come to school when you can, but if you cant thats ok, but not TOO ok, don't do it more than 2 times a month plus or minus 1 or two absences. Also there are different reasons you might miss school and some are more valid than others. Being sick is ok, having anxiety might be ok if its servere but you need to balance that against the cost of missing your education. Doctors appointments or other conflicting tasks could be fine, but its much better to schedule these things outside of school hours when possible. In general your parents can probably make that call for you and you should trust their judgement, but feel free to give ^your ^^feedback ^^^to ^^^^them... \"\n\nIts just a matter of trying to keep things as simple as possible to the message will stick. If you have a good reason to miss class, your parent or guardian should be able to make that distinction and advise you.",

Both ended up in the paper together when younger brother graduated. \n\nThen there was a girl with MY graduating class that hadn\u2019t missed a day since like, 7th grade or some wildly outrageous number.

            "Source: am ex teacher, managing school attendance is now my job\n\nIn the UK we're required by law to report persistently absent children to the local authority. We can then be questioned about these PA's and asked what support we're putting in place for the family to ensure the parents are fulfilling their legal obligation to get the kids to school. We have punitive ways of doing this (court/fine/prison) and nice ways of doing it - which is what you're seeing above.\n\nThe high value reward on offer is to wave under the nose of the persistently absent kids/parents. If this works as an incentive to reduce PA figures, the school can report a lower PA figure to the local authority which makes them look better in league tables etc. Where the school is an Academy, they'll have other questions to answer to the Academy sponsor as well. If the sponsors are assholes, this can create a climate of fear - leading to ridiculous incentives to get kids into school.\n\nAs far as a perfect kid missing out on one single day due to a family emergency etc, this is just a classic case of 'shit happens'. As I've said above, these incentives are designed to target persistently absent children, not those that take one day a year out due to emergencies.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI'm seeing a lot of comments on 'schools lose money if the kid doesn't show up' - this is not true in the UK at least. Some children are allocated extra cash per child if they meet certain deprivation criteria. If said child doesn't turn up for one day, the school still gets the money as it's allocated annually.",
            "Although I don\u2019t agree with having a sick child go in, I do think strong attendance should be encouraged.  I had horrible attendance as a kid, my mom let me stay home often and I definitely went over the maximum of days multiple times.  I had inconsistent grades and grew up with a shit sense of duty - then I dropped out of college after withdrawing for poor attendance (I got my shit together in my late 20s).  \n\nI\u2019ve worked in a school, and sporadic attendance really affects kids, too.  The kids that miss one or two days a month have to catch up with the class, and it\u2019s hard on them.  I\u2019ve seen one missed day throw off the rest of the entire week... \n\nMy son is in kindergarten, and he hasn\u2019t yet been late a single morning or missed a single day (he also hasn\u2019t been sick).  If we make the whole year, I do think he should be rewarded to encourage him to keep getting up and dressed, so that he knows that going to school is expected and important.  Not \u2018call out whenever.\u2019  His father wanted to keep him home two days before winter break for the convenience, and I said no because school is important.\n\nIf he gets genuinely sick with a fever or something, that\u2019s when I will absolutely keep him home.  But I\u2019m saving those days for when/if we need them.\n\nI kind of want a freaking reward.  Getting that kid up and dressed every morning is fucking hard, hahaha\n",
            "I\u2019m sure this isn\u2019t uncommon, but at my job, being just one second late clocking in counts against you just as much as calling in sick would.

In our last meeting I made a comment that HR did not like very much, I said, \u201cif being one second late is equivalent to calling off sick for a day, then why should I even bother coming in at all if I am already late when I pull into the parking lot?\u201d I thought it was a good point, but HR grumbled something about integrity and doing the right thing.

            "It's kind of a \"broken-windows\" phenomenon thing. If a school gives even the slightest hint that it does not care about student attendance, and does nothing to monitor it or intervene when students are not attending school, then it creates a whole raft of problems for students, parents and schools later on down the line. In short, if students suspect that schools do not care about attendance, then attendance across the board will decline.\n\n>Illnesses, family emergencies, accidents etc. do happen\n\nSchools know this and have different codes used for reporting attendance. Whilst not a universal truth, most schools discount absenteeism on the basis of genuine emergencies. Some schools also award attendance certificates if you are present in school over a certain percentage of time, e.g. 95%.\n\nNonetheless, being in school all day every day is an achievement and it should be recognised as such.

Well here ya go. i\u2019d bet a kid who was taught to strive to be the one that shows up more than anyone is gonna have way more success than otherwise. Lastly i remember my schools always excused sick days up to a certain number, and excused stuff like family vacations as long as they talked to the parents.

            "At my job we give awards for perfect attendance to our students at the end of the season. However, we also award \u201coutstanding attendance\u201d (allows for misses still up to a certain number based on classes taken) and \u201cmost improved\u201d awards, in addition to other unrelated awards of a higher caliber. The attendance awards mean the least here.\n\nThe concept is most certainly not to push attendance even when sick or during emergencies. It is to encourage \u201cregular\u201d attendance and participation. Our sport costs a pretty penny, and we have had instances where a student won\u2019t advance a level after a season, the parent demands to know why, and the answer is almost always the same- \u201cyour child missed x amount of classes. This equals x months of our season. Missing that much, they will not improve as much as the curriculum allows them to, and we cannot reward poor attendance with advancement.\u201d \n\nObviously extenuating circumstances arise and we take that sort of thing into consideration as well. But for people who just can\u2019t bother to bring their kid on a regular basis, striving for a simple certificate awarded at the end of year performance can do a lot of good when encouraging regular class attendance. \n\nI can see where they are useless in a normal setting, but we make them useful to up our regular attendance, and it works.

Multiple teachers asked me why I couldn't come to school with a \"headache\" and told me I was a baby.

Meaning if you don't have an adult to get you up, ready and delivered to school you (As a first grader) can't get there on time or even at all. This doesn't end the older the student gets. \nIt's similar to the data showing homes with more books had higher academic achievement.

Normally they only allowed this for people who had zero absences but the swine flu happened that year and they decided 3 was a good amount.  \n\nI missed a week with the swine flu, I also missed a day for a funeral (I even had a dr.s note which was rare for me because we weren\u2019t well off and only went to the doctor if we were super sick).

Chronic absence \u2014 missing 10 percent or more of school days due to absence for any reason\u2014excused, unexcused absences and suspensions, can translate into third-graders unable to master reading, sixth-graders failing subjects and ninth-graders dropping out of high school. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nSome research on the topic:\n\u2022 Chang, Hedy and Romero, Mariajose, Present, Engaged and Accounted For: The Critical Importance of Addressing Chronic Absence in the Early Grades, National Center for Children in Poverty, New York, NY, September 2008. This report documents the consequences, prevalence, potential causes and possible solutions to children missing extended periods of school in grades K-3rd. Although students must be present and engaged to learn, thousands of this country\u2019s youngest students are academically at-risk because of extended absences when they first embark upon their school careers. Nationally, an estimated one in 10 kindergarten and first-grade students are chronically absent. The report recommends that schools, communities and families monitor and promote attendance, as well as to identify and address barriers to good attendance.\n\n\u2022 Balfanz, Robert, Lisa Herzog and Douglas J. MacIver, Preventing Student Disengagement and Keeping Students on the Graduation Path in Urban Middle-Grades Schools: Early Identification and Effective Interventions, Educational Psychologist, 42(4), 223\u2013235, 2007. This study examines the application of an early identification and intervention system for students in the middle grades to prevent student disengagement and increase graduation rates. The authors follow a cohort of students to demonstrate how indicators reflecting poor attendance, misbehavior and course failure in sixth grade can be used to identify 60% of the students who will not graduate from high school. The authors find that by combining effective whole- school reforms with attendance, behavioral, and extra-help interventions, graduation rates can be substantially increased.\n\n\u2022 Allensworth, E. M., and Easton, J. Q., What Matters for Staying On-track and Graduating in Chicago Public High Schools: A Close Look at Course Grades, Failures, and Attendance in the Freshman Year, University of Chicago, Consortium on Chicago School Research, Chicago, IL, 2007. In this study of the freshman year of high school, researchers found that attendance in this pivotal transition year was a key indicator of whether students would finish high school. The study also found attendance and studying more predictive of dropout than test scores or other student characteristics. In fact, 9th grade attendance was a better predictor of dropout than 8th grade test scores.\n\n\u2022 Ready, Douglas D., Socioeconomic Disadvantage, School Attendance, and Early Cognitive Development, The Differential Effects of School Exposure, Sociology of Education, October 2010. Despite the substantial body of research documenting strong relationships between social class and children\u2019s cognitive abilities, researchers have generally neglected the extent to which school absenteeism exacerbates social class differences in academic development among young children. This study suggests that missing school in the early grades has a more powerful influence on literacy development for low-income students than it does for their more affluent peers. Put another way, school matters more to children from low-income families.\n\n\u2022 Balfanz, R., and Byrnes, V., The Importance of Being in School: A Report on A.bsenteeism in the Nation\u2019s Public Schools. Johns Hopkins University Center for Social Organization of Schools, Baltimore, Md., 2012. This report analyzes data on chronic absenteeism at the state level to begin the process of mapping its extent and characteristics. Although currently only a handful of states collect data on chronic absenteeism, results from a sample of states suggest that an estimated 10-15% of students in the U.S. are chronically absent each year. The report also highlights some promising practices among cities, school districts and nonprofits to combat chronic absenteeism. The authors offer policy recommendations on tracking and reporting chronic absence data and evidence-based interventions.\n\n\u2022 Hart Buehler, M., and Topanga, J., and Chang, H., Why Being in School Matters: Chronic Absenteeism in Oregon Public Schools, Attendance Works, June 2012. Although many states collect data on attendance in their longitudinal student data bases, the majority fail to make effective use of this data\nto analyze how many and which students are chronically absent. Demonstrating the value of such an analysis, ECONorthwest used data from the state\u2019s Department of Education to determine that 23 percent of students K-12 in Oregon were chronically absent in 2009-10, with low-income students atthe highest risk of missing significant amounts of school. Attendance problems in the early years predicted absenteeism in later grades, and students with the highest absenteeism typically scored lower on state assessments. This research also showed that poor attendance is a solvable problem by identifying schools that beat the odds by maintaining lower than expected chronic absence rates despite serving high risk populations.\n\n\u2022 Bruner, Charles, Anne Discher and Hedy Chang, Chronic Elementary Absenteeism: A Problem Hidden in Plain Sight, Child and Family Policy Center and Attendance Works, November 2011. This study confirms the premise that districts and schools may fail to detect high levels of chronic absence because the problem is easily masked by average daily attendance, one of the most commonly calculated attendance measures. While many educators assume a 95% ADA rate is an indicator of good attendance, the authors find that this is often not the case.",

            "The emphasis on perfect attendance for students by school districts is either because the school receives funding based on the amount students attending school or because attendance is one of the criteria the administration is evaluated by.\n\n I am a teacher and in my district teachers actually have a financial incentive to not take sick days. We get paid a stipend at the end of the year paying us the substitute rate for 3 days if we miss no days, 2 days pay if we miss one day, and 1 days pay if we miss 2 days. It's only about $100 for each day after taxes but every bit helps when you dont make much, get paid once a month, and dont get a paycheck in July. I haven't missed a day due to illness in 2 years because I need that $300 but I haven't really been too sick either. ",

            "Adoption and fostering only happens when something goes wrong. The child usually experiences trauma because of it. This trauma will most likely cause the child to act out and become a \"problem child\". This means those in care of these children need to be well trained in understanding child development and how to respond to a child's misbehaviour, even the worst kind, all while having a loving understanding of the child. The foster families and adopting families don't usually do it right, even with training. \n\nIt's very different than having your own child.",

They may have trauma from whatever caused them to be removed from their birth families, be doing drug detox or alcohol detox if newborn or have learnt to mimic behaviors of their previous carers that a none f Foster child would not even know of.\n\nDue to them already having been removed from situations some discipline measures are unsuitable for them, no time outs for example as it can spike anxiety and abandoned feelings.

            "I work in this space and whilst we don\u2019t have adoption in my state we do have foster care\n\nFoster carers need to go through training and checks to ensure they are in it for the right reasons (believe me they\u2019d plenty that aren\u2019t) and they are going to be able to meet the child\u2019s needs. \n\nFoster kids have a trauma background and the people who are for them need to know how to work with them in the right ways.  Parenting a child who\u2019s experienced trauma is different to parenting a child who has not. \n\nTraining around supporting them to develop their identity is something hugely important so the children know who they are, where they come from and why they are where they are.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn my experience the majority of parents don\u2019t want to abuse or neglect there child/ren. When they can\u2019t we get involved try to work with them to get them back on track or if needed remove for the child/rens safety however this is the last resort. \n\nAlso there is no way to stop people having babies without creating a ethical shit show around who is deemed an appropriate person to have a child and who is not. Different parenting practices and options exist, doesn\u2019t mean one is inherently wrong or right. There the notion of good enough parenting, you don\u2019t have to get it 100% right 100% of the time. \n\nIf children were born to parent that didn\u2019t pass the right test what are you going to do? Remove them? Because we have high enough workloads for children that are actually experiencing abuse or neglect without worrying about someone not passing a test.",
            "A license to have kids? That would require yet another government agency to over see said license, more laws and by-laws to be proposed and written and set. Ultimately more taxes to be levied to pay for all that. Education to be applied, more than crappy sex we get now. Then there would need to be policing of laws and policies, oversite of every step of this cacophony of fuk-tardedness just to say...yeah your fit to have kids.

            "On a similar note: my babies had NICU stays after they were born and I had to take baby CPR classes, a shanken baby warning course and several informational classes before I was allowed to take my children home. And nothing about the classes was specific to NICU babies, just things like \"how to bathe your baby and how often\" and \"ways to hold your baby\", with some bits about having medically fragile babies.\n\nI asked my mom because my brother had a NICU stay in the 90s, and she had to take similar classes. She said they told her it was because medically fragile babies are statistically the most likely to be abused.\n\nMy hospital told me that all the classes are available to all new mother's after they give birth, but only required for NICU parents",
            "The real reason is probably not as freedom-oriented as everyone likes to think. It's probably just so that the agencies are harder to sue for putting a child in a dangerous situation. Those kind of charges can carry some serious weight.\n\nTo everyone saying \"What are we gonna do? Take away peoples' kids?\" What do you think happens when a family abuses their children? They get taken away.\n\nI could see what constitutes abusing children or unfit parenting being expanded in the future. Never forced abortions. There will definitely be a gradual increase in child safety and quality of life as time goes on. The same way you could beat the shit out of your kids in the 70s and now a kid can call CPS on you for yelling. That trend will continue. Maybe in 40 years having under a certain amount of money will be child endangerment. Or not being home for a certain amount of hours a day.",

People that are getting married just because \u201cit\u2019s what you do\u201d get the chance to better understand what they are about to do.\n\nIf there were public courses about parenting that people are invited to attend before deciding to have a baby, maybe it will be the same thing. People that want a baby just because \u201cbabies are cute\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s just what you do when you\u2019ve been married for a few years\u201d would at least learn about some practical and psychological aspects.

            "Idk about other parents, but when you have a kid where I live (Alberta, Canada), we went to a bunch of different classes and got lots of information about how to take care of your baby. Pamphlets, websites, books, online/in person classes, and if your are proven to be irresponsible parents, you are forced to take even more classes and will only let you see your baby part time until you're finished. On top of this, you are required to do constant visits to various appointments to check the baby and they are constantly giving you resources to help you. Foster parents are a bit different, they often have to deal with kids who have been abused or through tough traumatizing situations. It makes some sense that there would be additional classes that cover information on how to deal with that. I would hardly say that there is nothing you have to do to be a parent, you just don't have to get pre-approved lol.\n\nTLDR, there are tones of classes and resources where I come from, and lots of required clinic visits and check-ups. Either they don't do that in the US, or most of you don't have kids.",
            "I don't plan on ever having kids, but if someone were to offer me and my partner parenting training as part of the various check-ups I would hop on that immediately. So maybe the question should be-\"Why isn't training offered to new parents having a baby?\". \n\nI'm sure there are some around, but the difference between 'available' and 'widely available and participation is advised' is considerable.

Foster parents have to go through extensive vetting to make sure that they're not going to add to the abuse these kids have already suffered and to make sure they are equipped to handle the mountain of psychological issues that come with these kids. Even with the extensive vetting, there are always some abusive types that make it through and get a license. There are a lot of fuckwads who see foster kids as easy targets because they've already been groomed to tolerate abuse and the government gives you money for them to boot.",

We choose not to have children. It is not that we don\u2019t like kids by the way.

Bell was considered a victory for America's eugenics movement, an early 20th century school of thought that emphasized biological determinism and actively sought to \"breed out\" traits that were considered undesirable ...\n\n> All told, as many as 70,000 Americans were forcibly sterilized during the 20th century. The victims of state-mandated sterilization included people like Buck who had been labeled \"mentally deficient,\" as well as those who who were deaf, blind and diseased.

            "Warning, once you get a bidet pooping anywhere that doesn't have one is upsetting",
            "We have a bidet with a blow dryer built in (Biobidet).  LOVE it.",
            "During the Great TP-ocalypse (T-Pocalypse?) of 2020, when people were filling their garages with enough ass-wiping materials to survive until the heat death of the universe, I decided to grab a couple of simple bidets to install on the toilets since I have a wife and two daughters, and even before COVID, was starting to worry about my personal contribution to global deforestation.  They're actually really easy to install, just mount it under your toilet seat, connect the water line from the wall, to the bidet, then to the toilet flush mechanism.  Check for leaks, give it a test (make sure you have the toilet seat down, otherwise *fountain,*) and you're set to go.\n\nNow, if you're not used to them, the first few times will be a, for lack of a safer word, experience.  Your body isn't used to having a pressurized stream of water aimed directly at, well, *that* (especially if it's THAT, according to my girls).  Speaking from personal experience, it was a bit of a surprise, but not concerningly unpleasant.  For the ol' #2, once you get done dropping the kids off at the pool, you'll give yourself a nice jetting off (be gentle at first, these things can go from 'soft shower' to 'maritime paint remover' with a slight turn of the dial), then grab a bit of TP to pat off the excess water and sometimes get what's remaining.  I did find that the water tended to cascade down the ol' coinpurse when using it, and that had to be dried as well, so please let your husband know.\n\nFor #1, with guys, it's business as usual, bidet isn't generally needed.  For girls, I can only speak anecdotally...similar to #1, except use the 'female' setting on the bidet--I believe most have them, it simply jets the water a bit further forward to reach that area.  Also, be especially careful with the setting (remember, 'paint remover'.)  Pat, pat with a bit of TP, and go on with your day.\n\nI did find that our TP usage dramatically decreased after installing the bidets (like 75-80%), and everyone in the house was stating that they just felt *cleaner* post-install, rather than with just using TP.  I can confirm that...when I'm at work, or someplace away from home, and have to do it the \"old-fashioned\" way, I never feel like I got everything, and I don't feel quite right.\n\nNow, you can go 'super eco' and use washable towels to replace the toilet paper, but...seriously?!?  No way I'm keeping two buckets of those for 'new' and 'used'.  I just threw up in my mouth a little thinking about that.\n\nOne last warning--note that these do hook up to your COLD WATER LINE.  Depending on where you live, you may want to consider ponying up extra for one of the heated water bidets.  I grew up in North Dakota, and I know how cold the tap water can get in the winter, which is wonderfully refreshing to drink but...nope, not there.\n\nAnyway, that's my little contribution to this discussion.  Hope it helps.\n\nEDIT:  JFC, I didn't know this would blow up like it did.  Thank you, everyone, for your comments and awards--it really did make my day memorable.  For those of you that are curious, I did link the specific bidet I bought in the comments, but I'll put it here for easier access:  [Bio Bidet | SlimEdge Home Bidet Toilet Seat Attachment, Fresh Sprayer with Retractable & Dual Nozzles for Feminine Wash & Adjustable Water Pressure | Non-Electric, white](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0854GTXH4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)",

I was expecting the food to be average considering the amount of time it took to make, but still to this day, it was the best meal I've ever had. \n\nPoint being, fancy restaurants are definitely worth going to, but they are even more interesting if you're alone in my opinion. You can people watch and really feel like a badass even though you couldn't afford dessert. \n\nTLRD: I went to a fancy restaurant by myself, paid a lot of money, but still had an amazing time.",

            "I don't understand why people think it's weird in the first place. \n\nI started eating alone when I was in elementary school - a Chinese restaurant opened in my hometown, and I thought it was SUPER-EXOTIC. A couple times a week I'd skip lunch and walk to the Chinese place after school and get a bowl of wonton soup by myself. We moved when I was a teenager, and there was a Wendy's with a Superbar within easy walking distance of my house. A couple years later I turned 16 and got a car, and would sometimes stop somewhere while running errands or whatnot. Then I went to a commuter university where people didn't bother getting to know each other - the student center cafeteria would mostly be people sitting alone. Then I got several jobs at MSPs (IT companies you hire to do IT stuff for your company if you aren't big enough to have a dedicated IT department). I drove from place to place fixing computers all day, so my choice was \"eat alone\" or \"don't eat at all\". And there were occasional solo business trips, too. \n\nLong story short, my wife thinks eating alone is the weirdest, saddest thing ever, but I've been doing it for 40+ years and don't think it's weird at all. I *prefer* company, of course, but don't mind eating alone.",

            "I've been a guidance counselor (male) for 20+ years. In my work with students ranging from ages 13 to 19, there have been many occasions in which the kid opened up about a lot of personal things. Many of them have never talked candidly with an adult who cared about them and respected them. In some cases, they confused their strong feelings of gratitude and warmth with love (or, in a few cases, lust). This is akin to what's known as \"transference\" in therapy. \n\nKids can have especially intense emotions and often they don't have the ability to sort them out and understand them fully. I think a key thing to remember is that many adults view teenage emotions as being dramatic or silly. \"You just *think* you feel that way\" or \"It's just a phase\" or \"That's just from your hormones going crazy\" or \"It's just puppy love\" are very dismissive of the kid's feelings and thoughts, devaluing them and this can cause emotional responses of embarrassment, despair, shame, guilt, self-criticism, anger (directed at self or others), and thoughts of self-destructive behaviors including non-suicidal self injury (e.g. cutting) or suicide. \n\nJust as many adolescents don't know how to understand their emotions, some also often don't know how to manage them. I think it's crucial when interacting with young people (as their parents, relatives, teachers, therapists/counselors, employers, co-workers, friends, etc) to keep in mind that their emotions are just as real and can be just as intense as ours. It's critical for their development and self-esteem for adults to use empathy, consideration, and thoughtfulness when dealing with teens.",

            "Like others are saying, be blunt, but also make it a learning moment to help ensure she is protected in the future.\n\nIdk something like, \"Listen, I have to be honest with you, I appreciate you having the courage to tell me (if she did), but this straight-up isn't going to happen. I'm not interested in you. It's not anything about you in particular, but I'm just not interested in anyone that much younger than me. And to tell you the truth, any normal guy my age should not be interested in you either. If they are, that's actually a major red flag. So if someone my age ever propositions you, please please please do not take them up on it. They are not normal and it only spells out bad, dangerous things. I get that it can be tough dating at your age. Teenage boys are idiots a lot of times who don't know what they're doing. They're all still trying to learn and figure the whole thing out, and that's tough, but those boys will genuinely like you for you and you'll get to learn and grow together. That's what you want vs an older guy who's had all those years to learn how to say all the right things, but is using that to mask his bad intentions.\" \n\nI think explaining, but also empathizing with her feelings in this way lets her walk away with her dignity and also imparts an important lesson. The teacher tone may also reiterate that you see her as a child and are therefore not attracted to her.",

            "Just be careful, if you use the age difference as a reason, to phrase it like that. \"The age difference is too big\"  and not \"you're too young\". The latter can be interpreted in all sorts of hopeful ways, the former less so. \n\nHaving been a 15 year old with a desperate crush on a 29 year old dude... teenagers have an active fantasy life, and every little thing can be twisted to fit the fantasy. The guy I was semi-stalking once told me that a particular comic book (involving a plot about a girl with a crush on her teacher) reminded him of me. I spent months obsessing about that book and **what he could mean by that.** The title of the book is still my username in several places. I'm 37.",

The audacity.\n\nIf he told me he had a crush on me, I\u2019d feel terrible for having to let him down. Poor kid pours his heart out and now I gotta squash it.\nMy empathy and sympathy for his situation doesn\u2019t mean I wish I was younger so I could smash. It just means I understand it\u2019s a rough situation for a teenager to be in and how much it sucks to be let down, despite the age difference. It still hurts to get your heart broken and it hurts to break someone\u2019s heart. Simple as that.",

            "I had a friend's little 15 year old sister throw herself at me when I was 21.  I told her that she was awesome and great but the age difference wasn't right and illegal in my state. I told her she'd understand when she was 21. Pretty much kept a solid message not changing tone. Also never allowed myself to be alone with her. \n\nAbout a decade later she sent me a message on FB and said I was right and pretty cool for how I handled it.",

He sat me down one night by the fire and straight up told me he was never going to see as more than a little kid. He told me that he thought I was one of the coolest kids he knew, but still a kid and I shouldn\u2019t waste my time on someone who would never feel the same way. I got upset not gonna lie, but over time he\u2019s stayed close with my brother and we\u2019ve talked about it as adults and he was very right. I\u2019m grateful for the firm advice.",
            "Don't even mention the flattered part.\n\n\"I'm going to be upfront with this, you are 10 years younger than me and a minor. I could never be attracted to someone who is so much younger and in such a different phase of their life and such compliments, while they are well intentioned, are not welcomed in this context. You should not be trying to pursue a relationship with someone so much older, nor even bringing up a topic of attraction. You are putting yourself in an extremely dangerous position to be targeted by a predator or abusive person by doing so, and there's a legal risk involved for the other party as well even if they don't mean you harm.\"",
            "Hitting these points tends to work well...\n\n* **Make it no big deal, like she's going through something totally natural.** A comment like, \"Yeah, it's very common for teenagers to have a crush on older people. I did too when I was your age.\" Saying it in a laidback tone where you come across as totally at ease with the convo helps.\n* That first point is important. One: It helps her save face. Two: It's possible this seems like A Very Big Deal to her. And, to her at this point in her life, it very well may be. But in  the grand scheme of things, this isn't some unique love that's meant to be. It's a standard crush. It's part of growing up. Framing it like the above point can help minimize the fantasy and give her a (kind) reality check. She can still fantasize and crush if she wants. Fantasies can be healthy and often inspiring; crushes can be invigorating and make life more beautiful. She just needs to know there's a sharp line between fantasies and reality and that the crush will not get acted on.\n* **Be clear that you're not interested.** \"If I were 10 years younger, I'd be flattered. But this isn't a relationship I want at this age. You're like a little sister to me. ETA: To be honest, adult men who would want a relationship with a teenager are bad people.\"\n\nIt's very common for adolescents to develop crushes on adults. These are important experiences that help put them in touch with their own romantic and sexual feelings. Basically, you're a muse that's helping her uncover sides of herself and what type of people she's attracted to. Her feelings are genuine and will likely help her grow as a person. Covering those 2 points can help her feel respected, not shamed, and cared for platonically.\n\nIf she's really obsessive and her behavior is and remains out of line, then you'll need other responses too.
