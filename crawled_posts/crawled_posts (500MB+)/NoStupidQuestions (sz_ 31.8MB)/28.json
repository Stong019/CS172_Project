            "Assuming you're using printers and cartridges as an example, that's the point. Environmental damage exists because it is in general easier and cheaper to do things that are worse for the environment. This ranges from throwing recyclables away instead of recycling, to chemical plants throwing unprocessed waste away directly into rivers. At some point, you have to evaluate whether the damage to the environment of some action is \"worth\" the alternative. In your case, this would be the cost of buying ink cartridges rather than new printers (buy a laser printer).",

            "Okay, I'm gonna put my Geek Squad hat on for this.\n\nPrinters suck. For finances, for the environment, for everything. They are built to fail. I understand how planned obsolescence is supposed to be illegal but that doesn't stop me from seeing printers come back, 13 months later on a 12 month warranty, with some unspecified, unfixable problem. Most of the parts are plastic and they will break if jostled around, used too much, used not enough, and it is so infuriating. The fact that printer ink is unjustly expensive is just another slap in the face.\n\nNow, we still live in an age where paper and printing is something we can't really do without. So what are our options? If you print as much as, say, a small business, getting a toner printer is the way to go. It's very expensive up front but you get way more prints per cost and toner is a little nicer on your machine as far as longevity. However, you still run into the whole plastic parts issue, so to be financially frugal I highly suggest you get a protection plan. I warn a lot of customers about it, and the ones who listen to me come back in that 13 months and get themselves a new printer for 20 bucks or less. The machine will go back to the manufacturer (if under a year) where the hope is they recycle the parts, or gets sent for recycling (if over a year).\n\nIf you print like a family with two school age kids who have projects and papers every week, having a ink printer is the way to go.  Pretty much everything I said above applies.\n\nIf you print infrequently, consider your local library or print center. 10c for prints every few weeks is so much better than buying a 100 dollar printer and letting the ink dry inside it and ruin it.\n\nAs far as the cartridges go, both ink and toner, there are recycle programs for them. I know both Staples and Best Buy participate in them. \n\nTl:Dr- To be frugal about printers, buy a printer according to your needs, not ease of access or wants. Be aware that printers are made to break and plan accordingly. Recycle the cartridges and the machines themselves.",

            "Simple answer would be to regulate the industry of cartridges. Make it required that the cartridges themselves be refillable, or something along those lines. \n\nThe entire point of regulation is to compensate for market failures, despite what some groups would have you believe. Profitable and sustainable are often a point of view, long term or short term. Sustainable is always the best long term solution, but opens you up to short term price cutting that destroys sustainable business.\n\nSo, you have to craft laws that allow for long term strategies to hold up over short term profit grabs. Things like making it illegal to make reusable K-cups not work in a kurreg machine. Such a bullshit marketing strategy is very detrimental to climate change efforts. \n\n\n\nSo, if you want to have a scenario where your best decision is also the cost effective decision, the simple answer is, tax the hell out of the harmful decision (like cigarettes) so that a less harmful decision is the most effective decision. \n\nMarkets can't make that decision in the short run on their own, because markets don't react to long run pressures very well, if the long run pressures are outside of the average lifetime of the product.",

What you have mentioned is actually a sales strategy of this type of machine, mainly influenced by the cost. Generally a machine cost about 30-50% on the print head. Therefore, the price of this printer probably equals two sets of original consumables. The original ink cartridges are very expensive, but you can also try third-party consumables. However, you still have to choose quality-assured products produced by major manufacturers. \n\nTake me as an example, I turned off the firmware upgrade of my Canon printer at home, and keep using off-brand compatible consumables, which greatly reduced my printing cost. The printing quality is similar, and I recommend it.",
            "Instant ink by HP gives free ink.\n\nIt's like a subscription service- less then Netflix, you are pretty much paying for the right to print, like at school or something.",
            "Stop printing stuff.\n\nMore broadly, though, this just goes to show how solutions to environmental problems need to be systemic. We can't rely on consumer choices to fix everything when the incentive structures for corporations are so deeply messed up.",
            "Its not on you. No mater what you will never produce as much waste as large corporations. You can help but ultimitly the narrative that its the peoples fault and that the people need to fix it is a lie,propaganda created by large corporations to keep the blame from them. This then allows them to keep their cost effective destruction of our planet.",
            "I hate the \"if you cared about the environment\" garbage.  It's meant to discredit those that are talking about or doing their part to help the environtment.\n\nIf all the folks from the US decided to meet in NY to fly to Europe for an environmental talk would be better for optics, I agree.\n\nBut to talk shit about using the fastest, cheapest way to travel to a far location to talk about the environment is absurd.",
            "Simple answer: you do as much as you can afford to do\n\nReal answer: you end capitalism",
            "Honestly, I\u2019ve always felt that whatever\u2019s good for the environment or you (organic food and stuff like that) is usually more expensive.",
            "Simple answer, you can't. There are people who study the intricacies of the environmental impact of specific items for their entire lives, and you can't be reasonably expected to have all the same knowledge they do. Besides, you're not the problem, the topmost sliver of humanity pollute more than everybody else combined, so there's really nothing you can do on a personal level about the problem. You can and should try your best, obviously, but regardless, your impact is miniscule. \n\nWhat you *can\" do is be more active politically, vote for representatives that promise to hold big businesses accountable for their actions and who work to implement environmental reforms, make sure your representatives know how important right to repair is, donate to organizations who are devoted to supporting these agendas, join protests and demonstrations, or organize your own. Basically, be heard. If everybody who cared about the environment put in just a little effort to do something about it on the macro scale, the problem would've been fixed years ago.",
            "Complaining, \"*how am I supposed to save the planet when ink printers are so cheap and inefficient?*\" is like saying, \"*how am I supposed to lose weight when Taco Bell is so cheap and delicious?*\"\n\n\nEasy, don't buy the cheap and inefficient printer. If you must print (I do) then either vote with your money and buy a printer that aligns with your values or only pay to print what you need at Kinko's or a friend's house."

            "It is almost certainly purposefully vague both because they're both intertwined. It's not a simple answer.\n\nThe phrase was *initially* popularized by Biggie Smalls in the song [\"Get Money.\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7AGFAcwY3U) The song is about being betrayed by a woman, but also how he enjoys women in much the same way. It's a consistent theme throughout his music. He talks about being misogynistic, while also legitimately being in love, while also being a victim himself because he falls in love with very flawed women, all together. The hook is \"Fuck bitches, get money\". This hook would infamously be mocked on 2Pac's diss song [\"Hit Em Up.\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41qC3w3UUkU)\n\nThe best example of this (and maybe my favorite Biggie song) is [\"Me and My Bitch\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rueScMSnRP4). At the start he says \"Me and my bitch\" like a young kid with an arm piece, bragging. Then he says \"Me and my bitch\" in the second verse, using bitch as an almost empowering term, like yeah she's a bad bitch who stands her ground and I like her for that. Then in the third verse, where he finds her murdered, he's crying \"Me and my bitch\", saying it ironically and painfully nostalgically because at this point he truly loved her *because* she was rough around the edges.\n\nThis is the same in \"Get Money.\" He switches back and forth in the song. Some of the lines are about him fucking bitches, others about getting money, others about being betrayed by women (fuck bitches).\n\nBut it doesn't stop there. In 2005, Lil Wayne released [\"Money On My Mind\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ffu7u9gvSU) on Tha Carter II in which the hook references the \"Fuck Bitches, Get Money\" line from the Biggie Song. This is where it became memed on the internet, and when it became reintroduced to the public, a decade later. And with this line, a lot of the context was lost, and nobody really knew which way it meant because when it first came out (and remember, even still today Biggie is one of the highest selling rap artists of all time along with OutKast, Kanye, Eminem, Tupac and others) specifically because of the reasons I mentioned above.\n\nSo, the answer is it's a double entendre on purpose. Neither one is the right answer. Thus, the genius of Christopher George Latore Wallace aka Notorious B.I.G.\n\nedit: added links",

Likewise, my partner's grandfather was in his 80s and still independent, until one day he decided he was old, and suddenly he started acting like an old man.\n\nThere is a very real cognitive side of \"feeling your age\", and it usually comes from whether or not you think of yourself as old. In other countries where the elderly are treated with more respect than younger members of society, like many Asian countries, you also have much smaller rates of the elderly going senile (note, I use senile specifically, because dementia is an illness, whereas senility is more of a state of mind). If you never lose that side of yourself (or have it forced upon you via illness or injury), there's a very real chance that you may never \"feel your age.\"",

If so, you should be able to pull the foreskin back from the whole head of your penis but no further.  The foreskin exists to protect and lubricate the head of the penis.  It shouldn't go any further than that.  If it is tight or painful during retraction, please speak with a urologist, because this can lead to a phimosis, which is painful.  \nAs far as washing, use a gentle, unscented soap and make sure you clean off any white residue (smegma), as left over grows bacteria and can smell/get infected.",
            "Hey man as somebody with similar daddy issues I understand. My dad was Jewish so I never had this specific issue (circumcision) but I\u2019ve had many others. Good for you for trying to find help even for something small like this.",
            "People do the most ridiculous shit to their dicks and nothing happens, pulling your foreskin back is one of the least damaging things you can do, as long as you\u2019re not pulling hard enough to rip the skin basically, which again, is still pretty hard to do, because it was designed to be pulled, in a way. Think about what\u2019s happening to your dick during sex..",
            "And here's the other thing they don't tell you:\n\nThe rim of the glans (the head) may have a small bit of skin attached to it on the top side. You may see two small holes on either side where smegma may be hiding. Now it's different for everyone, but generally speaking this skin attachment may slowly separate and reveal the full rim of the head as you get older, enter puberty, and become an adult. But others have reported that it never fully did and had to separate it themselves one small bit at a time. It kind of slightly stings.\n\nMy advice is for kids not to mess with it until at least puberty where it may already be separating naturally. In my family, I was taught to separate it one small step at a time around the age of 8 to 11. In retrospect I think it may have naturally resolved itself if I had waited.",

            "Make sure it will retract over the head when you are erect!  The first time I tried to get with a girl I could barely push it in because it hurt like crazy.  She probably thought I was nuts.  It was my first time and we were young, so communication wasn't my forte.  \n\nThen I had to push my foreskin back over the head.  I've heard some get stuck. \n\nAfter that happened I had to work to stretch it over the head when erect. Lots of patience and lotion. I was in high school at the time.  By the time I was with another, I had worked it out and desensitized the head a little. \n\nMore self care tips.   \nDont use normal soap to clean, hand soap, shampoo etc..  get ph balance or sensitive skin.  If I use regular soap break i out with a rash. \n\nClean once per day, but no more unless necessary,   can lead to rashes.\n\nWash up before you get with someone.  No one wants to smell it or deal with a messy foreskin.  I just flop it in the sink and wash with my special soap. \n\nWash up after sex.  I've gotten yeast infections from my partner before.  This is pretty rare.\n\nIf you use condoms at any point.   Make sure it is rolled all the way down.   Otherwise it will come off when your foreskin slides back and forth. \n\nGood luck",

            "When i was young my dad told me to pull it back occasionally so you could get to the point where pulling it all the way back caused no pain or discomfort. He said it was important to be able to be sexually active later in life. Now that I'm older can feel and see how much the foresking moves during penetration and having a properly functioning foreskin almost adds another level of lubrcation by reducing friction.",
            "Since we\u2019re on the topic, I recommend pulling the skin back somewhat while urinating too. It\u2019ll keep urine from staying in between the foreskin and penis so that bacteria won\u2019t have a source of moisture to thrive off of. It\u2019ll keep it cleaner. If you haven\u2019t done it before it\u2019ll be awkward but eventually you\u2019ll get used to it and it\u2019ll be like second nature.",
            "When I was 12 maybe this happened to me. My doctor asked if I cleaned it and I was very confused and didn\u2019t know you could pull it back. My foreskin was stuck to my dick head so I couldn\u2019t really pull it back. But eventually I got a little down and saw my dick head for the first time. Little by little I pulled it back until a got it out and I almost had a heart attack cause I thought my dick was gonna fall off and go down the shower drain. Basically after you get it down you just need to clean and touch it regularly cause after you first do it it\u2019s gonna be really sensitive.",

Took some balls to go to the urologist who told me to get circumcised but that was such a huge choice after being uncircumcised for 19 years.

            "When you sign up for the military, part of the deal is that you are subject to the laws of the military, which are separate and different from the laws that apply to civilians. It's like its own society, with its own laws, courts, attorneys, and judges. Different standards apply to those in the military, hence why people in the military can be charged, tried, and punished for things that are perfectly legal for civilians. One example of that difference is how freedom of speech applies: the military prohibits \"contemptuous speech\" against government leaders, while such speech is perfectly legal for civilians. Basically, those in the military do not have the same protections under the constitution that civilians do, and can be held to different and higher standards of behavior and conduct. This is, at least in part, because of the unique behavioral requirements that are necessary to maintain a functioning military.",

In his situation, in modern times he would have just been imprisoned and given a dishonorable discharge after the war was over.",
            "1 - Military laws against cowardice mainly reflect the refusal to follow orders to join a battle.  When a general tells an officer to tell a squad to go get that hill, the army collapses if they don't.  \n\nThat kind of situation doesn't come up often in policing, where the situations in question tend to come down to the discretion of the officer rather than direct orders.  \n\n2 - There are countless known examples of soldiers failing to stand tall, and these laws give external motivation where the training and internal motivation have failed. We are only now really starting to see the extent to which police fail to stand tall.  Some jurisdictions may actually pass laws requiring engagement as this awareness grows.  \n\n3 - The military has its own justice system to adjudicate these issues from a military perspective, which differs from a civilian one.  The police are ostensibly a part of the civilian justice system.  Would we want a police with its own justice system to judge itself?",

Because the Supreme Court said so. The case is Castle Rock v Gonzales, it was decided by SCOTUS in 2005. If you're into podcasts, I recommend the show 5-4. It's hosted by three current or former lawyers and they analyze terrible Supreme Court decisions, and they have an episode about this case because it's pretty vital to any understanding of why American police are Like That. \n\nThe tldr of Castle Rock v Gonzales is that the Gonzales children's mother, Ms Lenahan, had a restraining order from her stalker ex husband, and one day he took the three children outside of his scheduled visitation time, in violation of both the restraining order and their custody agreement, so this was a kidnapping. Ms Lenahan called the cops four times and even showed up at the police station to ask them to get her kids back, and they shrugged at her, and ultimately the father murdered the three children. SCOTUS found that the police hadn't done anything wrong because police don't have a constitutional responsibility to protect people. It's fucked.",
            "I AM NOT AGREEING WITH THIS, it is just an explanation.\n\nThe Supreme Court's reasoning is a practical issue that turns into a moral issue, that turns back into a practical issue.\n\nSomeone is drowning, does a police officer have an obligation to jump in and rescue them? What if the police officer is a weak swimmer and will get them both drowned? What if they remove their firearms to stop from weighing themself down and then someone picks up the weapon? Someone is being stabbed a block away. Someone asks why that cop didn't intervent? Because they didn't know about it? Prove it, prove they didn't derelict their duty to act. Someone is being shot a block away, a single officer doesn't go in and instead calls for backup. More people get shot, did the officer have a duty to run straight in without knowing the situation?\n\nCops and EMS and fire are taught scene safety first. Is it safe for me to go in? Or am I going to add to the body count/need someone to come rescue me. Even when engaging an armed suspect, the cops want overwhelming numbers, not the 1-2 guys going in like in Hollywood.\n\nThe Supreme court took this thinking and decided, in order to not have a bunch of lawsuits where the police failed to act, they just said the police don't have a duty to act. This becomes a moral issue, where we want the police to have a duty to act. But it goes back into the practical. Why don't we make a law that makes it a duty to act? Because we can't, practically speaking. Write me a law that states that the police have a duty to act, but allows them to not act in 'certain situations' or 'when they think it's better to wait'. You'll get something that is either so generic it doesn't mean anything, or so specific that it hampers the abilities of anyone to make any sort of judgement call. You'd need 100 lawyers/legislators and they'd all disagree.\n\nFor Uvalde specifically, a lot of police counties, especially more rural ones/ones that don't deal with a lot of gun violence still have the wait the mentality of a hostage situation. You get an expert hostage negotiator, and you basically wait out the hostage taker/plan in detail how to get them. They haven't trained/dealt with an active shooter situation where you have to go in quickly with very little information and leave dead/dying people behind. Notice that there's no middle ground between the 2 reactions. You're LITERALLY undoing 30-40 years of what you were trained to do previously.\n\nThe other thing about Uvalde was that no one was in charge/taking charge. You had a bunch of people coming in from other jurisdictions that WERE trained to go after the active shooter and were waiting for the go-ahead from someone in that jurisdiction. And they didn't get it and/or didn't even know who to get it from. Jurisdiction is a HUGE deal when it comes to policing. Those people's legal ability to act ends at a certain street unless given the go-ahead.",

I've had dark times in my life and I once threatened hospital staff. The police showed up with giant guns pointed at me (I was completely unarmed, just upset and distraught) and the seargant said straight to my face \"you can't threaten them like that. They're a corporation.\" Not even accounting for the actual PEOPLE that work there. Just the fact that a hospital is a corporation built for profit and it's illegal to threaten harm to it.

            "I don't see the answer in the top few comments, so I'll put it here.\n\nWhile police and military may look similar, they have two fundamentally different purposes.  At the most basic level, the purpose of a military force is to inflict force or the threat of force on people who are not members of this nation,  while the purpose of a police force is to inflict force or the threat of force on people who *are* members of this nation.\n\nThe job of the police is to make people follow laws.  You can make a lot of arguments about what the beat way to do that is, and whether police should be responsible for protecting people, and whether or not the police of any particular nation or state or city are doing their job the way they should, but that is all secondary.  The police are not here to help you, they are here to make sure you obey the laws.  Occasionally, them making someone else obey a law might also be beneficial to you or help keep you safe, but that is not even secondary, it is only incidental.  \n\nSo to your question of why the military can issue a court-martial for cowardice but the police don't have a consequence for failing to protect someone.  These are two distinct groups, which like we said may look similar from the outside, but were developed and are run independently, so there is nothing forcing one to adopt similar policies as the other.  In the military, it was decided that punishing cowardice with a court-martial would help ghen accomplish their purpose.  This, in my opinion, seems pretty rational, as cowardice in a soldier would directly prevent them from their main purpose of imposing force on someone not a member of our nation, so cowardice should be strongly discouraged.  For the police, nobody has forced them to have a consequence for failing to protect a citizen.  Again, this seems rational (though you can argue if it seems ethical or not), because failing to protect a person does not necessarily stop them from completing their primary goal of enforcing laws.  Their ideal outcome would be to prevent a person from breaking a law before they can do it (and thus maybe protecting you from being hurt by someone attempting to commit a murder, for instance), but if they have to choose between 1) saving you from being hurt but the bad guy gets away and 2) letting you die but they catch the bad guy and prevent him from breaking the law any more in the future, then option 2 is more in line with their primary purpose.  An individual police officer might have different ideas ethically and chose to save you, but this is not the job they are being paid to do.",
            "In the military you are held to totally different standards and the job is entirely different than being a cop.\n\n**Police have argued in court that their job is not actually to protect anyone at any time and they won**. \n\nWithout getting political, police have an entirely different job than what people actually think is their job, Once you understand the history, and laws and culture, it makes perfect sense why they are treated the way they are.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I tried really hard not to insert my personal views BTW.*",

The flight surgeon for Collins's moon mission \"decided to ignore that advice,\" and ignoring seems to have been the basic approach to the human sex drive ever since. It's the same way at the Russian space agency. Cosmonaut Alexandr Laveikin told me he too had heard that lengthy abstinence could cause prostate infections, but that the space agency pretends the issue doesn't exist. \"It's up to yourself how you will deal with it. But everybody is doing it, everybody understands. It's nothing. My friends ask me, 'how are you making sex in space?' I say, 'By hand!'\" As for the logistics: \"There are possibilities.

Dunno if other guys experienced the same, but this was what it was like for me anyway.\n\nAt bootcamp, there's rumors that they put something in the food to keep us from getting boners. As if being around hundreds of other dudes (for straight guys anyway) wasn't enough of a deterrence.  And I never felt the urge to jack off for the whole three months I was there.\n\nThen even after bootcamp, for a good couple of years I just didn't really have a particularly high libido.  Not sure if it was because of the constant training, and again being around other dudes all the time, or maybe they were still putting stuff in our food.  But I never really felt much of an urge to masturbate.  I mean, I could if I wanted to.  And during liberty ports, if I hooked up with some lady, I was more than able and willing to engage in intercourse.  But once it was back to the trenches, I once again never felt a strong need for sexual release.\n\nI then went on deployment where I was on duty 12 hours on and 12 hours off.  I was always busy and when I was off shift, I hit up the gym, got some food, and hit the rack to get as much sleep as possible before my next shift.  I did this for six months straight and also never felt particularly horny.  My theory is that the constant work and physical training probably kept me exhausted along with being around other dudes all the time again.\n\nThen finally, my last year of my enlistment, I picked up rank to where I no longer had a roommate.  Got a bit of a raise and didn't go eat at the troop chow hall as often, opting to buy my own food, and relaxed my training standards a bit since I was getting ready to discharge.  I noticed at this point, I was back to normal.  I was still living on base and there wasn't much pussy out in town in the middle of nowhere near the base I was stationed at.  So as soon as Friday came around, I got myself alcohol, locked myself up in my room and would jack off three, four, or more times over the course of a day.  That was pretty much my routine until I EAS'd.\n\nOnce I got back to the civilian world, hooked up with regular women, my libido completely returned to normal.  So anyway, I'd imagine NASA astronauts might go through a similar experience.  If I recall correctly, they're only up there for a year at most?  My experience in the military was over the course of several years in my late 20s.  A lot of the astronauts tend to be in their 30s already so they probably have more of a handle on their libido than some horny 20 year olds.",

            "I have a short story about this situation my boyfriend and I experienced about 3 years ago. \n\nMy old apartment complex had 'No Soliciting' signs at the entrance to the complex, and outside every building, near the door. My building had the sign directly next to where you would grab the handle, kind of hard to miss. \n\nI lived on the top floor of a three story building, we had no elevator. Two apartments to a floor. No lock on the main entry door, so it was too easy to walk right in and bug the residents who lived there. \n\nThere were multiple occasions where I had both JW and some 'you could be owed money from your electric company' people come calling. I hated these people. They would come to my door before 9 a.m., and after 6 p.m.  (Those were the hours for the office) Not so important, was the fact that the wannabe electric people would always ask to see my husband, followed quickly by asking to see our most recent electric bill. First, not married, and can make my own damn decisions. Second, why in the world would I give you access to my account information? These people really pissed me off. And they were far more persistent than JW, surprisingly. \n\nMoving on- They would pound on the door, disturbing the dog - who barked like a madwoman every time it happened - and disturbing us. My boyfriend and I both worked nights,  and so this got old quick. \n\nWe called the office, and when the woman answered the phone (she quickly became my favorite person in the company) she was absolutely livid that they were purposely coming over around office hours. She insisted that we call any time it happened, gave us her after hours number, and was happy to help with both herself and the police arriving to assist. \n\nShe was absolutely no nonsense. They made the mistake of coming after 6 on a day she was working late. I called her, she stormed over to our building and absolutely tore into these people. I'm pretty sure this time it was the fake electric people. The cops showed up after, and gave them citations, although I can't remember what for, specifically. I was scared of her, watching her tear these people new holes for their disrespect; I can't imagine how it felt to have that rage directed at me. \n\nThat No Soliciting sign was a huge help, but that woman from the office was a thing of beauty. The unwelcome visitors didn't show up for the year that we remained in the complex,  but I've heard the office lady moved on to greener pastures.\n\nEdit: Not quite as short as I meant it to be. Apologies.",

            "Here's an idea: when they show up at your door, answer it and say, \"oh, I could really use your help! Please follow me!\" Then lead them outside your outer apartment gate, lock it and tell them they the apartment building is private and they are not welcome there.\n\nOh, or you could do what I did with some Mormons that came to my door. It was the first time they showed up, so I told them I wasn't interested in joining their church or anything like that, but I'd let them say a prayer with me if they did some chores for me. Had those dudes do my dishes and mop the floor, I gave them some water, they said a prayer and I never saw them again. It was pretty great.",
            "The first issue is people letting strangers into a locked door complex.  Sure, it probably seems obvious that these are \"harmless\" people just going door to door to do \"God's work\" - but what if these where actually criminals that have come up with the perfect scam just to get inside the building.  You have every right to call the police for \"suspicious people that don't belong\" in your building.  You don't have to contact the landlord first and you don't need your neighbors permission to report that people are inside a locked community without the right to be there.  Now - the police might not remove them once they realize who they are - but if the police keep getting called for this, then they might stop visiting your building.\n\nThe second issue is that they are bothering you directly by knocking on your door.  If you are allowed to place signs on the outside of your door - post a \"no soliciting\" sign on your door.  If they ignore the sign and knock anyway - get rude with them - very rude.  Make it absolutely clear that you NEVER want to be disturbed by them again.\n\nI had issues with Jehovah Witness people coming to my door a few years ago.  I tried politely to tell them I wasn't interested.  After several visits - usually by the same group - I finally told them that \"If I wanted a sermon I would go to church on Sunday and I didn't need anyone bringing it to my door - now leave and don't come back.\"  I have never been bothered again.",

If they attempt to enter your personal apartment you can file trespassing. However, as long as someone opens the door for them and consciously invites them in, it is not trespassing. From what I hear however, they lurk outside the complex and sneak in when people forget to directly close the doors behind them.\n\nYes. They are attempting to trespass, but whether the police will care depends on how well you can document their repeated religion-based harassment.",

I'd give her whatever coins were in my pocket and turn down the book.. I'd explained that I was happy with my own screwed up version of religion and was sticking to it, it definitely didn't involve anyone but me and God.. anyhows, this thread made me think of her.. just a quick, no thanks and close the door now day if I get a JW or such.. they's just peoples too..",

            "Charitable Solicitation.\n\nIn one of the Jehovah\u2019s Witness cases, *the [US Supreme] Court struck down an ordinance forbidding solicitors or distributors of literature from knocking on residential doors in a community*, the aims of the ordinance being to protect privacy, to protect the sleep of many who worked night shifts, and to protect against burglars posing as canvassers. The five-to-four majority concluded that on balance \u201c[t]he dangers of distribution can so easily be controlled by traditional legal methods, leaving to each householder the full right to decide whether he will receive strangers as visitors, that stringent prohibition can serve no purpose but that forbidden by the Constitution, the naked restriction of the dissemination of ideas.\u201d\n\nSource: https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/amendment-1/door-to-door-solicitation-and-charitable-solicitation",

The day I moved in, I had the county sheriff and three bill collectors show up looking for the previous owner. I immediately closed the cattle gate at the end of the driveway and a week later put in a solar powered gate opener. I put up a sign that says:\n\nNo solicitors\n1.

Your landlord could make a trespassing complaint, though, if it's worth it to him. \n\nIf you call the police, they'll come, and probably be able to get them to leave, but without a complainant who has the authority to make the complaint, they really can't do anything to them about it. \n\nYour best bet is to call the landlord, try to keep track of who is letting them in, and let the landlord know that unless it's taken care of, you're going to keep calling the police until the property is deemed a nuisance property, and he'll start getting fined.\n\nEdit: this doesn't mean that you can't call the police. Of course you can, but just be aware that they probably won't be able to do what you may want them to do.",

The first time they knocked I thought they would be like every other JW so when said they'd like to talk about Jesus I said \"only if we can talk about Satan too\" and instead of giving me a judgey look or walking away they both smiled and started asking questions about satanism with genuine interest, they were the nicest couple who had time for everybody and would never forced their religion on you and just liked going around checking in on everybody making sure we were all happy in our lives.
