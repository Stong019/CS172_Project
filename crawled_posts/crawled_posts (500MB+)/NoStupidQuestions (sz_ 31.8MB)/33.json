After going toe to toe a few years ago, we agreed not to talk politics though she would throw some shady comments in now and again which I wouldn\u2019t acknowledge. At one of our last lunches together which was over a year ago, she teased me for wearing a mask. She also says she believes she never had breast cancer. She went through a lumpectomy and chemo and has been in remission for five years yet still states she never had cancer. Once I realized she blocked me I tried to contact her and even went to her house as this relationship is to valuable to just drop without an explanation. She didn\u2019t answer the door. I put a note in her door. Nothing. I\u2019ve asked a couple of friends close to us who, while they are still friends with both of us do not want to get involved. I grieved about this for two months then finally came to the conclusion that she has her reasons. At our last lunch together over a year ago I told her when she has time to call me and we\u2019ll  do lunch. Since it\u2019s been a year and I hadn\u2019t heard, I reached out. Nothing. Im still hurt and confused and honestly a bit worried about her. Has this happened to anyone else?",

            "Not me, my wife and Not over politics but yes. A long-time friend of my wife stops talking to her because I didn't let him take advantage of us. He basically tried to con my wife into buying a $10k car that needed a TON of repairs. I told him I was going to take it to a mechanic and when I did and the mechanic recommended not buying it, he got all sorts of defensive and just stopped talking to her. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTook her a good year to get over it. I supported her and kept telling her \"He's the one who tried to cheat us. \\*You\\* should be upset not him.\" But it still took a long time to get over the loss of friendship.",
            "If you think of it this way: would you still be friends with them if you met them for the first time today? \nIf people change especially this drastically - you are under no obligation to keep them as friends. You have the right to re-evaluate your relationship.",
            "Denying that she had cancer is pretty serious stuff. People do develop mental illnesses. \n\nYou've done your best to contact her. You can just mourn the loss and move on.\n\nI am so sorry that this has happened to you.",
            "I\u2019m sorry that has happened to you, it\u2019s certainly sad at the loss of the friendship for so long.\nFrom my experience, you can\u2019t make her like you or spend time with you. The more you try the more she\u2019ll pull away. You have to accept it, and maybe one day she\u2019ll come back.",
            "Same. A friend since kindergarten. Exact same thing ... Except she also left her husband and kids, lost her business and house... and is currently living with her shut-in elderly mother... it's so sad. Some people go too far down rabbit holes... Nothing you can do.",
            "I had a friend group that I joined as an adult, they had been friends since high school. One of the women in the group had a falling out when she and her husband decided to get a divorce. Several months after that she announced she would be moving out of state so I planned a going away party for her.\n\nDuring the going away party, she got black-out drunk and there was a physical altercation where we all refused to let her drive home and it escalated in a way that we had to forcibly remove her keys. (The friend whose house this was taking place at was a police officer so this was especially serious).\n\nAfter all the drama, she moved out of state and we honestly thought we would never hear from her again. She reached out to me a few weeks later however and we made peace. We were friends for several years after those events until around the end of 2021 she stopped responding to me.\n\nThis was not uncommon for our friendship, so I sent her a few messages in the first few months and eventually just stopped and decided not to say anything until she responded and if she didn't then I guess our friendship had run its course.\n\nAt about the 10 month mark she texted me apologizing for not responding and she had been in it with her current boyfriend but was going to try and be a better friend going forward, I told her it was ok and I was just happy to hear from her. Not even a month later I get another text from her that \"She didn't know what kind of shady shit me and my ex were up to but it was sketchy and she didn't trust me\" to never talk to her again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have no idea what she was talking about because the only ex of mine that she had ever met, she KNEW I stopped talking to him not long after we broke up because we decided we could not maintain a friendship. SHE HELPED ME THROUGH THE BREAKUP and was very aware of the fact that I don't talk to him anymore. I realized I'll never know what happened and that she decided to throw away an almost decade-long friendship over unknown causes, and I won't get closure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: A lot of people are wondering if she might have mistaken me for someone else, it's doubtful because she blocked me on social media first.\n\nThis happened several months ago and she has not said anything since then, but if she did I would probably respond. Also, while I am also not totally convinced her boyfriend (who I had met and she had been dating for over a while, he wasn't new) didn't have something to do with it, I was direct witness to her coldly cutting many people out of her life on her own volition so it wasn't totally out of character.\n\nFinally, the new state she moved to is actually where her family is located. If something were seriously wrong, she has people who love her close by.",
            "My best friend of 25 years and I also cut ties this year. Her husband is a schizophrenic who won't take his meds and by and by she is getting pulled into his world. On top of his mental health, they drink a handle of vodka in like a day or 2. \n\nIt hurts, but sometimes friendships run their course.  I realized I would never feel safe being around her husband and I can't feed into it. \n\nSending hugs, it'll get easier and that doesn't mean it's forever, there could be a reunion if wanted.\n\nEdited to add after reading other comments: it's gotten worse since the pandemic and he is also a trump.supporter and radicalized thoughts about the pandemic being brought on by the govt and etc etc. It seems to be a theme here..",
            "I lost a close childhood friend down the Q rabbit hole. One of our last conversations went like this:\n\nMe: \"You've been sounding pretty racist lately.\"\n\nHim: \"I'm not racist for saying things that are true.\"\n\nMe: \"Then what's true?\" \n\nHim: \"All black people are lazy worthless pieces of shit.\"\n\nMe: \"You really believe that without exception?\"\n\nHim: \"Yes, every single one of them is garbage.\"\n\nMe: \"That's literally the definition of racism.\"\n\nHim: \"I'm not fucking racist! I'll fucking kill you if you call me racist again!\" \n\nThen he shoved me down, and I thought he was gonna beat my ass but he just screamed a bunch and threw stuff. I am already crippled when this happened and have no way to defend myself. We were roommates and he kicked me out after destroying a bunch of my furniture. He stole the weight set I inherited from my late father even when I offered to buy him a brand new one, but he doesn't use it. When I moved out of town I went by to try one more time to get it and he said through the door he would kill me in his yard if I didn't leave. He has a bunch of guns and I believed him and left. That's the last time we talked. \n\nOver me shining a light on his racism, we went from best friends to worst enemies. The Q movement is really scary. What's funny is this dude is Hispanic.",
            "Thanks for the comments and honest opinions. The issue of mental illness hasnt been  far from my thoughts.",
            "I lost my best friend of 35 years this year\u2026 she met a man, moved to a red state, joined a evangelical church, and has become this strange conservative robot person. The last straw was when she used personal things that I told her, in confidence, to illustrate why I am a sinner. It\u2019s this shitty mix of sadness and anger. I\u2019m sorry you lost your friend.",
            "The part about agreeing not to talk politics and then still throwing an occasional stab at liberals and other lower life forms is familiar. \n\nMy mom started watching FOX news a bunch of years ago. Over the years she has come to agree more and more with their shitty perspective. \n\nShe\u2019ll throw out a line about how some group of people is destroying her street/city/county/state/country. I find it extremely distasteful and I tell her to stop quoting FOX. She insists it\u2019s not FOX but her own observations and gets mad at me for bringing up FOX again. She tells me she\u2019s not being brainwashed by FOX, but within an hour throws out another disgusting comment. \n\nIf I ask her to stop she gets passive-aggressive. If I point out that she\u2019s repeating FOX\u2019s talking points she gets offended. I find the only choices I have are to let her be stupid and obnoxiously offensive, or start an argument. \n\nI\u2019m sure that if wasn\u2019t her son she\u2019d have stopped calling me a couple years ago.\n\nExtreme political media is turning people against some non-existent enemy known only as \u201cthey\u201d. \u201cThey\u201d are destroying America and must be stopped. My mom has friends who she no longer talks to because they\u2019re part of \u201cthey\u201d.",
            "I think this became a little bit more common during the last couple of years because a lot of people got radicalized during the pandemic, it\u2019s kind of like loosing someone to a cult. \nI guess this happened to a lot of people especially in the United States.",
            "A similar thing happened with a person I used to consider a close friend, he just went down the Q rabbit hole and started increasingly pivoting every conversation into politics. I told him straight up that I didn't want to turn every conversation into a political debate, but he just kept trying. It eventually got to the point where I couldn't even send an innocent, non-political meme without it becoming a political argument. I eventually just cut him out of my life entirely, because it just wasn't worth the stress it caused me. It sucks, but it happens.",
            "Sounds as if she might\u2019ve fallen down the Q hole.",
            "Yes. Not over politics, I assume. But many years ago a very good friend told me that she no longer wanted me to be part of her life. To this day I don't know why. Just an email and poof. Gone. She unfriended me across everything. I spent a long time wondering what I possibly could have done to cause it. I rehashed every conversation, read back through all our emails, looked at everything I might have posted, and I cannot figure out what it was. I was heartbroken for a long time, hoping that someday she'd come around and want me again. I'd seen her do this exact same thing with other people over bizarre reasons, and I guess it was my turn.\n\nFinally, I realized I didn't want to be wanted by her anymore. She'd cut me out, and even if she came back, I didn't want to be part of the life of someone who treated me like that. I deleted everything we'd ever exchanged. I blocked her number. And I blocked her in all media - not so she wouldn't contact me, but so I wouldn't look at her profiles and wonder what I'd done wrong, or feel the pangs every time I saw her name pop up on a friend's post or whatever. I had to cut off my access to ruminate on things. I decided I was done, well and truly done.\n\nThe mourning at the end of a friendship is very real. Especially when one person is left with so many questions. Feel your feelings.",
            "I made two friends when I was 5 and have considered them my two best friends my entire life since (I\u2019m now 36). About 6-7 years ago, one of them just fell off the face of the earth. I have not physically seen or spoken to him since. I\u2019ve called, texted, FB messaged, etc. with very little response. We text on occasion, but it\u2019s just small chit chat. He\u2019s basically a stranger now. He didn\u2019t come to my wedding (he would have been one of my \u201cbest men\u201d if we were still in contact), and has never met my wife or daughter. I have no idea what happened. Wish I could know. Maybe I did something wrong? Maybe he has just gone through some hard times? I texted him recently because I was back in my hometown for about 10 days, and he didn\u2019t respond. So I am officially out. It happens. It sucks\u2026but it happens.",
            "Yes unfortunately, only I was the one who cut it off. \n\nI ended a 12 year friendship (I was her maid of honor etc) because she was posting so much pro-Trump stuff, and going to his rallies and giving him money. \n\nI\u2019m queer and I ultimately had to take a long hard look at our friendship, and what that meant about her as a person.\n\nI didn\u2019t ghost her though. I told her how I feel about it, and how honestly it was starting to not only make me uncomfortable but also to make me feel unsafe. And that I loved her, and if she ever changed her mind about all of that very far right stuff then she\u2019s welcome to reach out to me. But that I couldn\u2019t in good conscience support or be friends with someone who agrees with so many hateful things that are said about people like me. I asked her to picture my face every time she hears something hateful and ask herself if that\u2019s ok. \n\nThen I wished her the best and moved on with my life. \n\nI\u2019m sorry that\u2019s happened to you, it\u2019s happening a lot.",
            "Seems almost a trend.  A friend of 35 years stopped all communication 3 years ago, anytime we headed west (they live in Wyoming), we would stop and visit and have a great time.  During the Trump years we had one phone conversation (which was our last), where he was talking about how great Trump was for the coal industry..  I casually mentioned that even though I was a Republican up until 2012 (and a veteran), I could not support the republican party any longer or Trump in any way.  After that (my attack on the (R) messiah) which lasted 5 seconds, the phone call was ended and anytime I called or texted to wish him a happy birthday, happy wife birthday, anniversary over the next year was met with silence.  It's too bad, he was a good friend for many years.  I still wish he and his family much happiness.",
            "Yup. \n\nI received a text message telling me I'm a horrible person, I'm not worth any bother, to move away, and not to contact her. I lost about a dozen mutual friends, many of whom I regarded as family, as that was how I thought of her. Who knows what she told them. I wouldn't know since I'm largely being shunned.\n\nForty five year relationship, (I hesitate to say \"friendship\" since I am not aware exactly when we stopped being friends. She is, though.)\n\nNothing like getting drop kicked to the curb when you're on the downhill side of life. Never in a million years did I foresee this coming from her. The betrayal and hurt is sometimes unbearable. The fact that she couldn't even be bothered to talk to me amazes me.\n\nIt sucks massively. And it is hard damn work moving past it.",
            "One of my best friends of 10 years suddenly started acting cold and passive-aggresive towards me. One day, something flipped like a switch and he just started to acknowledge me less and less. During a two month period, he cut off all contact.\n\nWe were both guests at a mutual friend's wedding. He acted like a stranger, not talking to me and pretending to not see me when we were in a room together. I tried to get an answer from him, our friends - nobody told me anything.\n\nAt the wedding his wife got drunk and accidentally revealed to me that for some time, he would blame all his life failures on me, both big and small. Bad day at work? My fault. Meal too cold? Somehow my fault. Didn't get the job he wanted? My fault. Seat in a bus taken? You guessed it, my fault.\n\nTo this day nobody has any clue what exactly happened. One day he just picked a scapegoat and rewrote his reality to support that. I have no doubt that in his mind, he fully believes I'm the cause of all his problems, even though we haven't spoken in about three years. He didn't have mental problems before, at least none that anybody knew of. Something in him just snapped for no reason.",
            "I\u2019ve lost quite a few friends since Trump was in office.  They all went crazy.",
            ">  Has this happened to anyone else?\n\nYes",
            "My college roommate recently unfriended me on social media and I suspect it was because of a difference of political opinion.  We barely even discussed politics.  I don't like getting into friendly arguments with him because he always ends up taking everything personally and attacks you for random things that happened 10 years ago.  \"Oh, you think people should wear masks?  What about that time 10 years ago you misidentified a wire in your car?  Don't sound so smart now do you?\"  (he's a mechanic).\n\nIf those people don't want to be your friend, then they aren't your friend.  It sucks but that's just the way it is.  Just learn to let go.\n\nI have a couple more friends that have ghosted me and I have no idea why.  Mutual friends have no idea, either.  The lack of closure sucks but what are you going to do about it?",
            "This happens to me the other way around, as I lean republican.  But I have a rule, I'll only talk about politics if YOU bring it up and ask for My Opinion.  I will the warn you that I lean right.  \n\nI'm a firm believer that if this country is to heal and improve, we have to have open and respectful dialog.\nBoth sides need to respect the Person they are talking to.\n\nOp, it sounds like you did your part!\n\nNow, this has also happened to me with my own parents.\nThey are ultra conservative Catholic and I (ended up) married to a woman who had been married before.  \nWhen we were dating, I was told by then what I was doing was sinful (adultery, they believe you can only marry once, and then you must become celibate if you can't stay with your spouse, divorce is never an option, ever for any reason.). They now ghost me and pretend I'm dead.\nAnyway, for the last 6 years I send them cards on holidays and tell them about my life.  We have only spoken once during that time and it was to tell me that the will was complete from my grandma's death.\n\nBottom line OP,\nYour freind is in pain from loosing you as a friend too.\nThey probably feel that seeing you and knowing that you don't agree on things is salt in the wound.\nI'm sorry you lost a friend, but they were never a true friend.  It just took a hardship to flush out how they were not that dedicated to the friendship as you were.\n\nAs for me, deep down I know my parents will need me in the future, and I hope we can start over on that day.\n\nGo make some new friends, and find happiness.\nRemember what was good about the friendship, and learn from this what \"ghosting\" pain has caused you.\nI prefer to end friendships (which is extremely rare, but happens) face to face when possible and as cordial as possible.",
            "My republican, Qanon cousins believe that I either traffick & eat babies or if I don't do it personally, I approve of the elite democrats who do eat & traffick children. I have known my Qanons for about 50 years & although I miss who they used to be, (sorta), I know they refuse to or can't be saved, & since 'crazy' spreads in humans very quickly, I won't ever speak with any of them again.

            "My friend of 5 years, who I thought was one of my closest friends, got married and didn't even invite me. I knew of his wedding from another mutual friend.\n\nI was truly hurt. I even reached out afterwards to offer my congratulations. He never replied. In hindsight, the weeks leading up to the wedding I could already feel he was different, but thought nothing of it.\n\nMy head cannon is that he cut every contact with me out of respect for his wife. Which I wouldve understood. But alas, I was left hanging. I suppose he has his reasons too. Still hurt tho.\n\nI cant imagine how you must have felt to have lost a friendship worth 40 years \ud83d\ude2d Im so sorry for your loss. Hope it gets better.",
            "Yeah, I cut ties with my very best friend of 30 years when he went down the conspiracy theory rabbit hole, tied himself into knots defending January 6th, and began making deeply racist remarks couched as \"political opinion.\"\n\nI did grieve but I grieved for the friend he used to be, not the person he is now. I don't like the person he is now, and if your friend is doing things like teasing you for wearing a mask and \"throwing in shady comments\" regularly, think about whether this friendship is viable anymore.\n\nShe doesn't want contact. That's clear. I get feeling hurt but you can't \"save\" her. She's decided her political feelings are more important than the friendship. And honestly, if you've gone toe to toe with her over politics and are upset about her denying having cancer, it sounds like you have too. I'm not saying that's bad - that's exactly what I did. I decided my principles didn't encompass accepting someone who advocated what I view as treasonous activity.\n\nIt sucks but that's the landscape we live in right now.",
            "Yes, I had a close friend of 5 years ghost me unexpectedly, and similarly our mutual friends didn't want to get involved. \n\nI think the mutual friends piece made it even more painful, because it's like *someone has to know something*! Finally about a year later someone shared with me the things that \"Judy\" said about me, and they were pretty nasty and frankly twisted around and untrue. Something that a simple conversation would have assuaged, but Judy-- for whatever reason--decided ghosting me would be easier than talking it out with me. I went to therapy and tried to unpack what those reasons might be. Judy was a Covid denier, and I was very much not, and I think that fundamental difference is what led to her choice to cut me off.\n\nFor my own closure, I wrote an email to Judy about a year after and I basically wished her well, thanking her for the friendship we shared. Admittedly, part of this was to stop the trash talking. She was often gossiping about me behind my back based on what our mutual friends shared. I asked them to stop telling me, and to stop allowing it. \n\nAnd then I found out that one of the random accounts that had been following me on Instagram was actually Judy. I decided to block her-- if you don't want to be in my life you don't get to see it!  \n\nIt called into question all of my friendships - many of whom were mutual with Judy. It's really, really hard. Harder than a romantic breakup, especially when there's no closure. And it's a really mean thing to do.",
            "I\u2019m sorry that you\u2019ve lost your friend. \n\nIt may sound exaggerated or hyperbolic, but she\u2019s effectively part of a cult. Whatever rabbit hole she has fallen down, into and subscribed to, it will be just like a cult. There won\u2019t be any room for outsiders such as yourself. \n\nAnd it\u2019s with regret that you\u2019ve lost your long standing friend of 40 years. I\u2019m sorry for that. \n\nThere will be many responses here that will say, time grieve and to move on, good riddance etc (they have a point, but it\u2019s never that easy). My advice is perhaps slightly different. Write to them. Nothing big, nothing dramatic, but send them birthday and Christmas cards, send them well wishes, write a few lines giving an update about yourself if you wish. I wouldn\u2019t expect a reply, in fact I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll ever hear from them again. Maybe your notes and cards will go straight into the bin, but maybe they\u2019ll get read. \n\nYou aren\u2019t going to be able to change their mind or their deep seated views. But you can write to your old friend, just don\u2019t expect anything back from them. That\u2019s the best I can offer. Maybe that gives you a sense of closure, or a sense of trying. \n\nAll the best.",

At this point it may simply not be healthy for you to keep kindling a relationship with someone hateful.\n\nMy parents used to be Republicans. At least, that\u2019s how they identified (grew up Idaho, Mormon, military, etc etc.) Trump finally opened their eyes and they let loose their humanity. Now, all of their best friends are confidently open hateful racist ignorant bigots, while my parents keep their mouths shut, and even hide that they\u2019re vaccinated! My parents work to maintain these lifelong relationships \u2014 why, I ask them, WHY? These people are openly cruel to our family\u2019s status (Hispanic GSIL, gender-neutral GS, trans GBF, gay nieces/nephews, etc.) and yet my parents want them in our lives? To, what, preserve a 50-year friendship\u2019s history? To what ends? Higher attendance at their funerals?\n\nYour friendship has run its course and probably wouldn\u2019t survive the coming decade of open fascism anyway. People grow and change across decades. I think you should enjoy your beautiful memories and let your friend go.

            "Yes. A college friend cut contact for whatever reason we still do not know. \n\nShe moved back to New Jersey after college and for her 30th birthday, two friends and took her out for the weekend in NYC. We stayed at a hotel, had dinner that night, went out to a bar after. The next morning we had brunch, went shopping and thought everything was just fine. We were all having fun and chatting. Suddenly she said she had to go. She forgot she was going to make dinner for her boyfriend (who we had met once before when they came to our city for a visit) and his friend. And then she up and left. It was odd and we thought it was out of character but just figured she just genuinely forgot. So we went home and tried to contact her a few days/a week later. She had blocked our phones, unfriended us on Facebook and bascially disappeared. \n\nA mutual other friend who lived in NYC said to us, about a year later after trying everything to figure out why she went no-contact, told us cryptically \"She will tell you why in her own time\". OK what? That was 17 years ago and not one of us has heard a peep from this friend. Still have no idea what happened.",

Until I saw on her Facebook that she was at the Capitol on January 6th. We haven\u2019t spoken since November of 2020, our friendship of 8 years gone. It felt like losing a sibling and was very hard. I am so sorry you are going through this.",

            "Unfortunately yes, I had a close friend for 3 years- we'd do everything together and see one another at least 3 times a week. I supported him through a bad break up, to the point of helping him move and staying with him for a few nights while he got emotionally stable. \n\nWeeks later he met a new woman and he essentially just stopped communicating with me about a month after. I tried the same things as OP, text, calls, visit, letter, trying to get mutual friends to help, all to no avail. The ghosting culminated in him UPSing a box of borrowed books to my house that he was apparently too afraid to return face to face. A couple days later I was told by a mutual friend that he was moving out of state. \n\nSo OP, from experience, one's behavior is their own and you can't impose your logic onto someone else's actions. It sounds like you have left the door open on your end, know that you have acted in the best way you know how and can make the decision to reengage with her if you'd like should she reach out.\n\nThis is not your fault.",

            "I\u2019m going through something similar (albeit not nearly as much time) with someone who was my closest friend for 20 years. It wasn\u2019t until the last 2 years or so that I noticed he had insidiously changed from a kind hearted, open minded guy who would defend his friends to the death to a condescending, Andrew Tate follower who looks down on others who don\u2019t share his views and goals for life. He\u2019s become the type of guy who mocks poor people for being poor and has a superiority complex that stems from his many insecurities. He often started arguments with me about politics and other social topics with no intention of having a good faith discussion about the topics. One day, after starting an argument with me about how I\u2019d feel once he\u2019s a multimillionaire while I\u2019m still working a normal job, I told him that luck is going to determine his success in becoming a multimillionaire far more than hard work will. He got angry at that and deleted me off of Snapchat, telling me I (his closest friend) was holding him back. That\u2019s when I knew our friendship was over.\n\nI was angry for awhile, but I realized that the person I knew from all those years ago was gone (and had been for some time now, even if I didn\u2019t want to admit it) and if I met him for the first time as he is now, I would never want to be his friend. Once I mentally separated his former self from his current self into two fundamentally \u201cdifferent people\u201d, it became much easier to let go of this lifelong friendship. So sorry you\u2019re going through this. It gets easier with time. \ud83d\udc95",

I think my subconscious mind has a hard time with the lack of closure, whereas my logical mind has accepted the reality.\n\nBeing ghosted by long-time friend is a special kind of hurt.

That could be where she\u2019s coming from with you. Perhaps she got too wrapped up into the politics and wrote you off as some lousy lib (other people\u2019s words not mine). Maybe you\u2019ve become a democrat who\u2019s actually wildly far to the left and scared her off, not too sure. Best of luck though. I am of the opinion however, as is my wife, that two people can\u2019t be friends of the opposite sex while married, so perhaps she felt need to distance due to her husband, if that\u2019s what she\u2019s got going on.

We've been friends since middle school, I contributed a decent sum to her wedding (the groom was another friend I've known since middle school), and I never suspected any crack in our friendship. The last time I saw her was when she gave me a ride. I heard about her divorce a few months later and was somewhat surprised by it, but what really caught me off guard was her cutting contact with a ton of people, myself included.\n\nWe're still on each other's socials. I see her pictures with other friends and I can only question why, after 3 years of no-contact, she decided to cut off our friendship. But life happens and you move on.

They loved my wife and everyone got along. In 15-16, Trump started to get popular. My friend made a joke about him at lunch and his mom, sister and her husband started talking about how great he was. The next few weeks they got more vocal. Most of us were quiet and tried to change the topic. They started posting crazy theories on Facebook and got mad that my wife commented on someone else\u2019s video on Facebook where she made negative comments about trump. We started to notice that they acted differently towards us. They didn\u2019t talk to us as much and we stopped going to lunch together. My wife noticed that 2 of them removed us as friends. They never talked to us about anything. There was never an actual conversation about anything regarding our political differences, but they knew we were not fans of Trump. We thought they were still good people, but Trump changed them. We would look at their Facebook posts periodically and they were all posting more than usual. The posts were getting very negative and hateful. They didn\u2019t seem as open minded and welcoming as I\u2019ve known know to be. I started hearing about them having more disagreements with other friends in the church regarding politics. My friend had to distance himself from them because they only wanted to shit talk liberals. They started wearing clothing that had conservative messages on them or Trumps name. We don\u2019t talk anymore and stopped going to the same time at church.

Suddenly she stopped texting. I thought it was weird. I would see her on FB commenting on things and I would chime in, no response. I can't figure it out. I went to her apartment and knocked no answer. Talked to the management office, after some story telling they told me she moved out.\n\nWhether it was true or not, she just chose to not have a relationship with me.

We just gelled immediately; we had shared life experiences and shared views on life and shared a desire for adventure. He got married across the Atlantic \u2014 I was surprised to get an invitation; he was surprised I showed up. I\u2019ve never married, but I asked one of his wife\u2019s bridesmaids to marry me (she declined, but I never would have met her at all except through this guy).\n\nIt was that kind of relationship: we both had TONS of opportunities in those 2-3 years to do other stuff with other people, but even living 2 hours away, we consistently chose to get together and just live live in our mid 20s together. We crashed on each others couches at least once a month by late 2015.\n\nThen Trump came down the escalator. I slowly, painfully watched a man who had become a close friend, whom I would have asked to be one of my groomsmen, slip further and further away.

He and his wife have two young children together.

A couple years later, they're fully on the Republican fringe as evidenced by what their posting on Facebook (I am more interested in the truth and rule of law). One thing irritated me enough that I went to the trouble to question it and post as evidence a link to a reputable site.

And, I'm also beginning to suspect there's advice on Republican fringe to unfriend and break ties - even with long-standing relationships - if they are not in sync with the fringe nuttiness.

I had started to distance myself by not engaging via phone or text as often, but when his wife left him, though it was his fault, I felt I had to be there for him, so I sort of renewed our friendship. After a recent trip that was supposed to be fun that he hijacked with his personal crap and constantly ranting about his extreme views I dropped him off at the airport and blocked him everywhere. It was his narcissism, violent temper and general combative demeanor that I just couldn't take any more.\n\nWhile all of this was going on, my next closest friend had re-married to someone who was extremely introverted and jealous of his time.

This friend, in my experience, has always been a positive influence in my mom's life and I always had the sense that feeling was mutual.

I think about her almost every day. \n\nShe got high and was having an anxiety attack (from my perspective) and she was screaming to go to the hospital. We tried taking her down the stairs but she stopped us because she didn\u2019t trust us to get her down. From my perspective she seemed to calm down after that so I thought all was ok. Next day she is texting me that I left her to die and that she barely survived the night, and that she could never trust me again. I tried convincing her that I would never let that happen again and that I would take her to the hospital no matter what next time, but she could not let it go. We had other issues up to this point as well, some my fault, others her fault (though she would not take personal blame for hardly anything) and in addition she was also starting to change.\n\nShe was working a real job and getting money while I was broke and in school. She would always want to hang out but I couldn\u2019t because I didn\u2019t have money (or time) and she hated people not paying her back or spending unequally. But she also wanted to hang out and go places and do things that cost money. So it was an awkward spot for me. She was living her adult life but I couldn\u2019t yet and I still can\u2019t for a while. \n\nI still miss her and think about her often. I feel horrible guilt and pain whenever I think about that night. She was like my sister and I still can\u2019t believe she dropped me like that after a decade together.",

I tried to discuss with her that her anger issues were taking over her life and costing her almost all of her relationships personal and professional.  the result is I'm now ghosted. I really hope she gets the help she needs and can finally live a happy life. I really did see us being little old ladies together, but I guess it was not meant to be. still breaks my heart been 2 years since we've spoken.  from daily contact and hanging out constantly to nothing is really hard.

            "Yup, happened to me a couple of years ago and it was a blessing. I\u2019m a democrat dad and he is a republican dad, both in our fifties. He rode the Trump Train to CrazyTown and has stayed there.",
            "She chose the cult over you.\n\nIt isn't your fault.",
            "I had a friend jump on the Trump train and turn totally delusional.  She also seemed to know someone who died in every public disaster like 9/11, an earthquake in Italy, a terrorist attack in London.  She bought a gun to kill Middle Eastern terrorists.  When my boyfriend basically refused to believe that she lost a cousin in the London attack she blocked us both.  Sometimes you have to walk away and I did.  The woman is insane.",
            "Could be a mental health thing. When you're in the pits of depression it can be nearly impossible to do seemingly simple things like returning a text message. If you suspect this is the case keep trying.\n\nCould be the politics. She may have decided to cut out everyone with a differing opinion. She may have moved into a radical faction of the party and it consumes her. If this is the case there's probably not much you can do.\n\nCould be religion. I mostly mention this because I live in Utah and see this a ton. People join or leave mormonism and cut out lots of their friends and family. It could happen just as easily in a number of high demand religions.\n\nCould be something you said or did that you didn't recognize. The fact that the first thing you mentioned was that you were blocked makes me think that something you posted flipped a breaker in her and she decided to go no contact. I think this is the most likely scenario.\n\nCould be that you are tied to a painful time in her life. My wife had a friend move out of state and she tried to keep in touch, but after a while the friend confessed, I had a lot of bad things going on in my life back then and I'm glad you were there for me, but today you remind me of those times and I just can't keep reopening those wounds anymore. \n\nCould be that she's ashamed of some of her recent decisions and doesn't want you to know about them."

            "I had a tampon in me when I had a cardiac arrest and was subsequently placed in an induced coma. When I woke up, my tampon was removed. I know this doesn\u2019t answer your question as I wasn\u2019t dead, but someone must have done a quick check down there. I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s protocol, so I can see a medical examiner doing the same when examining a dead body.",
            "If the body were to be turned over to a medical examiner, they would remove it during the autopsy and document it.  It wouldn\u2019t make it to the funeral home still inside.",
            "If you're going to be buried the mortician does lots of things including that. If you're going to be cremated they may do an autopsy but that's about it.",

            "There are quite a few wrong assumptions on this thread, so I\u2019m going to try to tackle a few and still answer the question. \n\nPlace and manner of death, and then type of disposition of the body are the two things that matter the most in answering this question. \n\nNot everyone gets an autopsy, even if the death was unexpected. Medical Examiners can be notified, and either speak to responding officers or inspect the scene, determine no obvious foul play and assume manner of death was natural, and decline an autopsy. For instance, a 60 year old overweight lady in her chair surrounded by cigarettes inside a locked apartment is discovered; that person isn\u2019t getting an autopsy. \n\nIn that scenario the most likely thing is a removal team transports the body directly to a funeral home; if the family needs time to choose they may have their own holding facility. That team is very unlikely to do anything more than a cursory inventory of effects, like jewelry, wallet, or clothing. She could still have a tampon in. \n\nScenario B: same 60 year old calls 911, and an ambulance comes, or she\u2019s already in the hospital. It\u2019s very likely the medical staff will strip the patient at some point, and hygiene products would be removed so as not to interfere with any other necessary medical work. \n\nScenario 3: 25 year old dies in a car crash, still, autopsy is unlikely, though they may do a tox screen, odds are pretty low they are doing any prep of the body, so again, that person is going to the funeral home with the tampon in. \n\n\nNow we get to the disposition part. Not every body is embalmed. It is not required in many cases. Some people choose not to have viewing; some choose cremation or direct burial, and some choose viewing without embalming. Not every family brings in clothes, and not every deceased is \u201cprepped\u201d. Some are left exactly as they died, and placed into a casket or cremation container. There would be no need to check genitals for hygiene products in any of those cases. \n\nIf the deceased is being embalmed, and the string is noticeable, the embalmer is probably going to remove it. However, if it\u2019s tucked in, no respectful person is giving the genitals much attention. Basic wash of the whole body, and then the attention is on leakage and the vascular system. It could easily be missed. \n\nSo there you go. TL;DR: there\u2019s a very solid chance you could still have a tampon in when buried or cremated.",

I've noticed that sometimes if I'm speaking in Spanish out in public with another Spanish speaker people nearby who only speak English will get upset and tell us, \"this is America, we speak English here and you have to learn the language!\"    I'm wondering why they get so upset, considering that our conversation has nothing to do with them.   If I ask why they get upset, they say it's considered rude.  And nowadays, you run the risk of upsetting a Karen type who will potentially cause a scene or become violent.\n\nI have gone to amusement parks where there are a lot of tourists from different countries and if I hear whole families speaking in their native tongue that I don't understand, my family and I don't get upset or feel threatened.  We actually enjoy hearing different languages and dialects from other countries.  \n\nI do not understand why it is considered rude.  If I am speaking to you I will speak in a language that you understand.  Otherwise, the conversation is none of your business.",

They probably werent, but thats the feeling it brings on.\n\nThat said, the situation you're describing specifically is just racism. Spanish is the second most common language in the US, with some 41 million speakers.

When I meet someone speaking the language of course I strike up a conversation. It's always a little fun when an African visitor \"n'ta spanta\" (gets surprised) when a random white dude can chat when them in their native language. \n\nBut every now and then, rarely but it happens, some asshole is around to yell at me for speaking n***er language.

One of the directors didn't like it and started scolding us every time we did. We kinda just ignored her every time. It started as being annoying but then it was just comical. \n\nI recommend you simply ignore this type of behavior and move on. Don't even bother acknowledging them. Although this will aggravate them more.\n\nThis only happens when people are monolingual. I have never seen this type of behavior from bilingual/polyglots, althought I could be wrong.\n\nI can conceive of the following: if I didnt know any other language but one, and people all around me started talking in different languages, I couldn't avoid feeling excluded. I couldn't stop not making it about myself. Of course it has nothing to do with me, but it'd be hard not to feel that way.\n\nI guess telling people to speak english is a knee-jerk reaction to thwart feeling excluded.",

I live in a border town;  I literally can see Mexico from the rooftop of my house.  This is a small town.  The lady that became offended with the Spanish language was about 60+ years old.  My friend and I are both light skinned Latinas.  In fact, my friend is blonde and blue eyed.  \n\nThis does not happen regularly.  There are a lot of people of Mexican decent that live here and a lot of Spanish is spoken.  However, I am reminded of my senior year in the 80's of a teacher of mine that sent me to the principal's office (the only time I ever got in trouble).  I was in the hallway going to class and  a student needed help locating a classroom.  He asked me (in Spanish) and I helped him find it.  As I responded in Spanish, this teacher of mine said to me, \"Didn't I tell you that you students are to speak English in school?  Go to the principal!!\"  When I showed up to the office I told the secretary the reason I was sent.  The principal overheard and  came out of his office.  He asked me who my teacher was and apparently not surprised when I told him why I was sent.  He and his secretary exchanged a look; I was sent back to class because this teacher was known to be racist.",

            "So here's the thing, language is power. being able to understand and use language to navigate a space or direct the flow of events is power. If you don't speak that language, you don't possess that power.\n\nMany white people are accustomed to white privilege, and part of that is a subconscious expectation of a power differential in their favor, an implicit precedence in the social environment. If you, as a nonwhite person, have a conversation in a language they do not understand, you are shaping the social environment in ways that white people cannot understand or influence, and it can feel uncomfortable or even threatening to a white person. A particularly racist white person, one who is very protective of their privilege, might then assert their power by saying \"their\" language, English, is the one you should be speaking. The implication is that they want the only language they speak to have the power. They want to maintain their precedence and be comfortable. When they say \"this is America\", they really mean, \"you are in a country of white people, don't do or say things that we don't understand, because it makes us feel less centered and in charge, and only we are allowed to be centered and in charge, unless we give you permission to do so.\"",

Comparing the truth to the estimate will determine if/how much you receive or pay.",

For example, they would have no idea if a relative moved in and you started taking care of them. Plus they would never comb through deductions that you might receive like a tax preparer would.",

            "Lots of comments about this being a scam. The IRS does NOT, I repeat, does NOT know how much you owe. They know how much you made and a few other things officially reported to them (e.g. state and real estate taxes, student loan payments, etc). They can extrapolate from that how much you should owe based on the standard deduction and tax rate. \n\nHowever, what they don't know is how your other deductions and credits will play out. For example, they have no idea officially how much in charitable deduction you made. They don't know your rent expenses or job expenses. They don't know if you are filing jointly or separately, who is claiming the child deduction in a divorce or shared custody situation, or any number of things that rely on non-reported information. It is actually in your interest to put that all together to see if you qualify for a larger deduction, or if you can get credits off of what you would otherwise owe. Not defending the tax prep services trying to make bank off this. There could easily be (and are) free tax prep services.

Most individuals receive refunds and its in the IRS's best interest to make you file your taxes in order to receive that refund rather than spend money on employees to determine your refund and then more to give it to you. Also, for most businesses, taxes are very complex and require year round attention to ensure accuracy.

            "If you get any kind of puncture (or otherwise deep) wound outside or in a dirty environment, you should **immediately** go get a tetanus booster if it has been more than 5 years (some sources say 10) since your last dose or you have never gotten it. There\u2019s a common misconception that you\u2019re only at risk of getting tetanus if you have a puncture wound due to a rusty piece of metal, but that is not true. **Any** puncture/deep wound that you got in or exposed to a dirty environment (especially outside) can lead to tetanus. The classic example we discussed in a medical microbiology class I took was someone getting stabbed by a large thorn while gardening. This also includes any kind of animal or human bite wound that broke the skin. \n\n**Why should I get a vaccine if I\u2019ve already (maybe) been exposed?** Because the incubation period for tetanus is 1-21 days (average is 8 days). Incubation time generally varies based on how far the wound is from your central nervous system.  ([SOURCE](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/tetanus.html)) You might have enough time to start building an immune response thanks to the vaccine before the tetanus starts causing problems. It could save your life. \n\n**But I\u2019ve already had tetanus! I\u2019m fine, right?** Nope. Having tetanus does not confer immunity. Only vaccination does (yay super cool methods used to come up with this vaccine that can provide immunity!). ([SOURCE](https://www.cdc.gov/tetanus/clinicians.html))\n\n**Someone I know had tetanus and they just got a little lockjaw. Tetanus is no big deal, right?** Nope. That\u2019s great that they were fine, but it doesn\u2019t mean you will be fine too. According to the WHO, the case fatality rates for generalized tetanus (the most common type) can range anywhere from 10% to 70% depending on factors such as age, treatment, and overall health of the patient. ([SOURCE](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/254582/WER9206.pdf;jsessionid=9D5591460B7536FB9AF7C47642D6BD05?sequence=1)) Plus, tetanus recovery can take months, and you don\u2019t want to have to deal with a hospital bill of >$800,000 USD after staying 57 days in the hospital (47 in the ICU) [like this family did when their child got tetanus.](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6809a3.htm)\n\n**Why do people associate tetanus risk with stepping on a rusty nail if it isn\u2019t true?** Probably because it IS true that stepping on a rusty nail puts you at risk of contracting tetanus, it\u2019s just that things that aren\u2019t rusty also put you at risk. The bacteria that causes tetanus needs an environment without oxygen, like the environment found in a deep puncture wound. And object like a nail happens to be a great delivery system to bring the bacteria right into that deep wound, especially if it\u2019s rusty as the rust creates an uneven surface with lots of little pockets perfect for bacteria to hang out. Also, a rusty object may be more likely to be found in a dirty environment (like outside), where the tetanus-causing bacteria abound. ([SOURCE](https://www.discovery.com/science/Tetanus-From-Rust))\n\nTLDR: Stay up to date on your tetanus boosters, and don\u2019t think you don\u2019t need to go in just because the nail you stepped on wasn\u2019t rusty. **There is no cure for tetanus, only prevention!**",

Allow me to explain to you some things you may not know if you're from the coasts and/or major cities. \n\nCorn Fields are not scary, nor are they easy to get lost in as movies like Children of the Corn may trick you to believe. The reason we call em cornrows is because they're planted in straight, parallel lines.

If you wake up in the middle of a field, just walk down the alley of Corn that you're in. You'll go straight and eventually come out to one of the roads or at least a ditch. Just watch your eyes and hands. Corn can cut ya.\n\nDo not, under any circumstances, fuck with agricultural equipment that you aren't trained to operate. Accidents are rare, but when they happen, they're bad. These machines are designed to cut, move, or otherwise handle literal TONS of produce at a time. Your bones won't save you from any of them if you end up in the way. \n\nSame vein, do not ever, and I mean ever, enter a grain bin or similar structure holding granular produce. Do you wanna know one of the worst ways to die? It's called engulfment. It's where you sink in to grain or corn or something, or in some cases have it dropped on top of you. It's the worst parts of drowning and being buried alive all in one. There are usually about a dozen engulfement deaths a year, and the worst part is the only way to find you after is to drain the bin and hope a corpse doesn't come spilling out half decomposed.",

            "One time I took the day off of work to wait for a FedEx package that needed a signature.  It was my new car exhaust and I was excited to get it.  I was sitting in my living room 15 feet from the front door.  I happened to look out my back door and I see the truck speeding away from my house (I live on a corner so I can see the street from both the front and back).  I run to the front door and see the \u201csorry we missed you\u201d tag stuck to it.  Motherfucker didn\u2019t ring the bell or knock or anything... just hung the tag and bolted.  I\u2019m guessing he didn\u2019t want to carry the heavy box up to the house.  I jumped in my car and chased down the truck... got my package... fuck FedEx.  It\u2019s the worst delivery company by far.",

            "FedEx Ground driver here. \n\n   I admittedly will say as far as delivery goes, plenty of corners are cut by the drivers including myself and there is multiple reasons for this.\n\nFedEx Ground drivers aren\u2019t actually employees of FedEx. FedEx hires contractors to gather a fleet of drivers together to drive and deliver in trucks that the contractor himself owns. He/She gets paid for each of the stops that we complete, and have bonus incentives from FedEx if we complete our job well. \n\nHere comes some important and probably eye opening info:\n\n    Most of the contractors that FedEx hires treat their drivers like shit. \n \n- Low balling drivers on pay and lying on what they can afford. (Drivers often have to negotiate price, and play a \u201cvalue of my work\u201d game in order to even get decent pay, and if you don\u2019t know how to play that game you will almost always get underpaid\n\n- CONSTANT Attendance guilt tripping and threatening to fire. \n\n- Keeping the bonuses they get from FedEx to   themselves instead of sharing it with the drivers\n\n- Overworking drivers by giving them 150+ stops in non-condensed neighborhoods with no incentive or motivation to push through a hard days of work. \n\n- No work benefits whatsoever. \n\nThese are things that every FedEx Ground driver is subject to. \n\nAlso to clarify FedEx Ground and FedEx Express are two different things. Express actually works for FedEx, Ground drivers do not. \n\nFedEx is such a garbage company. The most stomach turning thing for us is that FedEx hires contracted fleets for door to door delivery for Ground, which consists of ALL types of packages. heavy, huge, and small. \n\nThey do this so they don\u2019t have to offer any health benefits because its more likely that a driver is going to get hurt on the job... Express drivers actually work for FedEx and they deliver ONLY small packages. So FedEx offers them health insurance because its way less likely for them to get hurt. \n\nWe VERY RARELY get helpers at all to help the drivers deliver, as UPS and others have them more often.\n\nWith all of this being said, I do enjoy the contractor i work with now. He actually pays well. (Even though i had to really bargain for it) And the route is fair in work load. I try my best to deliver the packages as they should be delivered in a safe location and one piece. But knowing you are working under shitty conditions makes it very hard to enjoy the job or even want to. So some driver can be very careless at times. This isn\u2019t a justification, just simply an explanation..\n\nALSO BIG POINT: \n\n 95% of the reason you are receiving packages all fucked up is because the trucks loaders literally toss shit all over the place in the morning before we dispatch. Theres not much we can do about that except tape your shit.",
            "Recently had a 600 dollar pair of ski boots go missing. I checked my door within a minute of FedEx marking them delivered (they didn't knock or anything) - I literally saw the FedEx truck drive away. No boots. I think the driver swiped them.

            "I don't know, but they're horrible. We use them for work and if we request a pickup from our office, there's about a 25% chance they'll actually come pick the package up.

            "I work at FedEx as a package handler. There is a mismatch of how many employees we have and our productivity standard. Productivity is always the most important metric so we can\u2019t hire enough people to run the freight in the allotted time. We have some form of injury very frequently, I think our counter was at 4 days this morning. On top of all that, most days, we send out 30,000 packages which go through many different employees on their way to their destination who are all focused on working as fast as possible and not focused on quality.",

            "Yeah it\u2019s frustrating when packages arrive damaged or the drivers don\u2019t even attempt some deliveries.     FedEx drivers are contracted out, not official fedex employees.   I work at a FedEx warehouse where the pay isn\u2019t the greatest nor are the hours.    Packages that go through each warehouse have to be moved from trailer to belt system to either another truck or the delivery van,  and each time they go on the belt system, there is a high probability of the packages getting in the mix of at least 1 jam and when that usually happens the belts keep running forcing other packages behind it putting pressure (can be small or heavy big boxes)  and that alone causes damage, not all the time.         Plus the package handlers are being forced to push 1000\u2019s of packages an hour through each belt system in limited time frame.\n\nAlso, you gotta blame whom ever packaged your item(s) cause a lot don\u2019t have anything inside to protect it from any outside force nor do a good number of packages have enough tape to keep the product that\u2019s inside the boxes from falling out either on ground or on the belt (I\u2019ve had to repackage so many packages after picking them up and the bottom just breaks open cause the tape job was horrible and/ or the product(s) inside are too heavy for that particular box)\n\nFedEx by me usually does great on delivering.",

            "I have basically nothing to add to the conversation but I heard from a former FedEx driver that you should never ship a package through ANY delivery service unless you pack it well enough that you would willingly throw it down a flight of concrete stairs.",
            "This is late to the conversation, but I work as a package handler at a fedex ground warehouse. I haven\u2019t been working too long, but from what I\u2019ve heard from most experienced workers is that this past year has been hell for them. Normal shifts are supposed to be about 4 hours of sorting and loading packages. During the peak season in November and December, they were working 10 hour shifts from 1am-11am. All my shifts have been 5.5-7 hours long starting around 2am. They can\u2019t get enough workers even after a ton of pay increases. The job is fast paced and I load anywhere from 3-6 trucks at a time. We were told to do \u201chand to floor\u201d loading, which just means to carefully set down packages. I try to do that as much as I can but it\u2019s often too busy to be careful with every single package. \n\nAll of the trucks are completely full. The warehouse I work at now have pallets that people load instead of trucks because theres not enough rooms for the trucks to be lined up correctly in the warehouse. If there an oversized or heavy package, it\u2019s either getting crammed in of stacked in the middle of the truck.",

I had things stuck in different FedEx hubs for over a week. Even had something that was going 20-miles be delayed.",
            "As a current FedEx package handler, i can say that more often than not packages are trashed in the facilities and not by drivers. As package handlers we get paid well but not held to many standards aside from how fast we load.\nSo whether you order a patio furniture set or a small box of cookies, it's faster and easier to yeet it into a trailer to keep load rate high.\nMy apologies to everyone's heavy package I've ever dropped into the belly of a trailer for my own safety.",

            "Fed Ex uses independent service providers (subcontractors) to deliver packages. Look on the side of their delivery truck for the small writing. This means you'll receive vastly different service depending on which contractor actually delivers to your house. \n\nThey are all paid differently, depending on who owns the ISP, and each ISP lease the rights to slap the FedEx name in the side of their trucks. They are also anti-union. \n\nUPS is pro-union, has a national contract that insures (in theory) consistent pay for all employees. Much better benefits and pay than FedEx drivers.... especially the benefits. \n\nI've worked for both companies over the years, sometimes at the same time.",
            "UPS got Amazon contracts, and the increased cashflow and accountability shifted the better workers to UPS, and the crummy ones left UPS to fill in the FedEx slots.  \n\nAlso, when FedEx bought RPS to be their Ground division, the company was infected by Roadway\u2019s business more than the other way around.",

They kept insisting it was at my house and if they went out to pick it up and send it back to me (wtf) I'd have to pay for this truck going out (wtf!?).

The unloaders take out the boxes from the sixteen wheelers and just toss it on the line. Unfortunately, we are the face of FedEx since we are the people you see and not the people inside. The ones working at the warehouse are mostly teens or people in their early to late 20s just working a part time job while they go to school.

FedEx delivered my Home Chef package, set it on the curb (instead of my porch) and set a box with an 18 lb kettlebell ON TOP OF IT, crushing my food. Did I mention my food was set out basically on the street, next to a mailbox, where dogs pee?\n3. FedEx lost a pair of expensive running shoes. Said they couldn't be delivered. Had another pair of them overnighted to a friend's address with no issues.\n4. FedEx delivered another Home Chef box on the curb, by the mailbox, where dogs pee. I was home and caught the driver and expressed my displeasure. \n5. FedEx said a package from Wayfair was undeliverable. When I went to the terminal to look for it (a 6x9 rug) they brought it out and asked if I was going to take it home in my vehicle (it was raining and I would have had to roll the windows down in my SUV for it to fit, so NO). I told them their job was to deliver to my house, so I made them honor their obligation. \n6. Home Chef delivery was on the same truck as the rug in #5. It never made it to my house. Raw and spoiling shrimp and pork drove around my city FOR THREE DAYS before FedEx said the package was \"damaged and undeliverable\". I hope it stunk all to hell. I really do. \n7. On four more occasions, FedEx marked my package as delivered when no truck stopped at my house at all that day (Ring camera confirmed). They would get delivered the next day or the day after most times. Some I had to go retrieve from the terminal. I don't remember being employed by FedEx nor having customer pickup listed as a delivery preference, yet I seem to have to go there to retrieve my packages.\n8. I have had no issues with UPS or Amazon at all last year, I would actually leave water out for the Amazon guys since I pretty much knew when they'd be arriving. \n9.

            "Well a few reasons. \n  \n They are consistently moving toward more \"casual couriers\" which is basically an uber model, and pretty much all FedEx Ground employees are independent contractors who aren't held to as high of a standard as Express.\n\n As for the Express side(2-day, overnights) we have basically not been running service since March 2020. Meaning that we don't get penalized for having lates. The influx of packages, especially during Christmas and the snow storms has crushed our systems to the point where some days we will just not even receive an entire plane of fright to our station. \n\nLastly they just don't treat employees very well pay wise, to the point where we have people there 20 years not getting top of range pay. Heck I'm making less than a dollar more than a new full time courier after 10 years. So naturally it is hard to keep people around as the job can be very physically taxing.\n\nSource: am Express driver for 10 years.",

            "As an Ex-Fedex Handler, I can tell you that when I was there things were bad but it probably got even worse during Covid-19. I don't if Fedex ever had glory days like you are saying mostly cuz I didn't work at the company when it was gold standard. I think the company has become more focused on numbers and time constraints more than quality. The majority of the employees are underpaid, given the intensity of work, and overworked. I think Fedex banked on the employees being fast but eventually created an environment that didn't prioritize them. I remember working and always being told to by multiple managers that I needed to be a team player when it came to doing other work things that I never signed up to do. Jobs that were paid more but I had to do them with the base pay of a Handler. These kinds of incidents, on top of other things, are probably one of the many reasons that Fedex has gone down in quality. Treat your employees like shit and get shit results and shit reviews.",
            "Hiring practices and bad employees",
            "I work at a Fedex Office in my city. We not only ship, but also pack items both fragile and non-fragile. We put in a lot of effort on our end. Unfortunately, if things aren't done properly down the chain (loaders, conveyor belts, drivers, etc..) there isn't anything we personally can do once it leaves our store, despite the number of calls we get about driver complaints and package issues. If it doesn't leave our store on time, or is an issue within our control, we can help, but once it's gone from our store there is next to nothing that we can personally do.\n\nAs people have stated, ground drivers are contracted and aren't actual Fedex Employees so there are lots of issues between the groups and the company I'm sure.\n\nThis is frustrating for me. I've worked at my store for 4 1/2 years and I hate the fact that our work is frustrated or utterly ruined to our detriment, as well as the paying customer. I take a lot of pride in my level of effort I put into my job, and it frustrates me that there are so many issues down the line.\n\nThat being said, a lot of problems can be easily avoided by effort of the customer at the time of shipping. Verifying the address is correct, and not shipping things against the law or policy can prevent a lot of issues. \n\nA good example is that we recently had a customer ship $10,000 to someone who turned out to be a scammer. We aren't allowed to ship cash at all. We can ship checks and gift cards, but not cash and certainly not internationally. The most we can do to prevent this is ask what the customer is shipping or ask if they are shipping specifics like cash, dry ice, or dangerous goods. If the customer is specifically telling us lies then we can't help prevent accidents like this. Luckily in this scenario, the customer realized that it was a scam before it arrived, so the package was redirected back to the sender after law enforcement got involved, but it really shouldn't have been necessary in the first place.",

They didn\u2019t have a single extra person that could cover for his route that day or the next? It wasn\u2019t even a holiday rush, it was in March.

            "Lots of good answers here, but as an American and veteran that served in Afghanistan, most of the ANA and ANP we\u2019re not exactly thrilled to be in the military/law enforcement. They did it for a check to feed their families. Many were playing both sides. Ultimately, in Southern Afghanistan where I served, the best analogy I can give to other Americans is that it was like the Wild West in the early formation of the USA. There were no actual laws, just government officials that took bribes and made shit up as they went. DC could say they had federal control, but in reality, it was insanely chaotic. \n\nUnifying Afghanistan would be like telling Native American tribes here in the US that \u2018hey, you\u2019re all going to be one big tribe now and be happy about it\u2019. Oh wait. That\u2019s basically what we did in the 1800\u2019s. And ended up killing most of them to do so. \n\nThe best solution I can think of in my (very) limited knowledge of geopolitics is they should have broken up the country based on tribal/religious beliefs, based on what those people wanted. That could have been the mission over the past 20 years. Otherwise, we have what we have now which is a country with no sense of identity because outside of Kabul, there is very little sense of Afghanistan as a country. \n\nFurthermore, the Taliban never left afg. They just waiting for the US to leave. We swung a sledge hammer to kill a fly and ended up killing 10\u2019s of thousands of innocents unnecessarily and never defeated the enemy we went there to fight. (Which is debatable anyway, because technically that was al queda, not the Taliban.) Meanwhile, the country is no better off now than before. Actually, it\u2019s worse, because the Taliban took all our equipment we gave Afghani forces.",

            "I know comparisons to Vietnam are numerous, but the parallels are staggering. Just like is South Vietnam, we trained these people to fight with American support: we didn\u2019t train them to be self sustaining. American ground troop and air combat units did most of the fighting while the indigenous army was relegated mostly to mopping up and garrison duty. And when they DID get into actual fighting, the first thing we trained them on was \u201cIf you get in a jam, call Uncle Sam\u201d and the US - usually in the form of air support - would show up and solve the problem for them. They were never trained for the possibility that Uncle Sam wasn\u2019t gonna pick up when they called. They don\u2019t know how to fight without the overwhelming firepower the US provided. Afghanistan has no real Air Force to speak of and what DOES exist is reliant on US mechanics to keep flying, because nobody thought it prudent to train Afghanis in fighter plane or helicopter maintenance. To use an example from Vietnam, when Nixon decided to \u2018Vietnamize\u2019 the conflict, the US found they couldn\u2019t train Vietnamese soldier to fly helicopters cuz all the training manuals were in English. That meant you had to first teach them English before you could ever teach them to fly. Why were they only in English, because no one seriously considered the possibility that the Vietnamese would NEED to fly helicopters until the possibility slapped them in the face. It\u2019s the same in Afghanistan. There are so many places in the Afghanis defense forces where americans were an absolute necessity - top to bottom - that when you removed them, there was nothing left. The Afghani forces were more hole than they were cheese, to use a Swiss cheese metaphor.",

There is criticism that no proper exit strategy was ever formed, and that the sudden total withdrawal happened despite the Afghan government clearly not being able to provide peace and security afterwards.\n\nThere are many reasons they couldn't which could be over-simplified under a blanket term of a lack of nation-building, but nobody is holdng the US entirely - or even primarily -responsible for that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen viewed overall it paints a negative image of a war that was rushed into, lasted 10x longer than we were told it would, that lacked an exit strategy and with an aftermath so poorly managed by all countries that the entrire 20 year endeavour was undone within a week by the same group it was originally taking on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's not that the US is at fault for the Taliban taking power, it's that it has again highlighted just how piss-poor the US military is at everything that comes after military victory in a conflict.",

            "British person here. It\u2019s not that different from Iraq and the toppling of Saddam Hussain. Hussain was a brutal dictator, but he also understood the various tribes, ethnicities and cultures within the regions of Iraq and was the (toxic) glue that held it all together. America and the UK, went into Iraq with great bold intentions, but equally had no grasp of how things worked or actually were in that country. Kind of arrogant of us to think that we did or that we could easily sort it all out by arriving with tanks and bombs and it would all work out fine. The same applies to Afghanistan. \n\nThere seems to be a pattern of invading places, winning the initial battles and then everything just seeping or eroding away over a number years. There\u2019s a saying that America is able to win wars but never wins hearts and minds. \n\nWhy is the US being blamed- that in part might be a certain view that\u2019s being offered up via the media outlets where you are from, but as someone from outside the USA, I\u2019ll say that \u2018the war on terror\u2019 felt very much like an American ideological thing, and an oversimplified response to 9/11. Certainly the feeling in the UK is that Tony Blair lead us into a conflict just to suck up to George Bush. Blair\u2019s reputation is really tarnished because of it. \n\nThe other aspect I\u2019ll note is that the local people who acted as translators etc, for us need to be granted political asylum. That\u2019s something that shouldn\u2019t be turned into a political hot potato, they helped us and worked with us. I also hope that we don\u2019t go back to the fear mongering days where Muslims were a perceived danger, that political hyperbole and fear mongering doesn\u2019t do anyone any favours at all.

            "Okay so, modern Afghanistan history:\n\nIn 1978 the dictatorship led by Mohammed Daud Khan fell via a violent uprising, and a communist republic was founded. Of course, being communist in the 70s meant you were an automatic ally of the USSR and an automatic enemy of the US.\n\nThe communist government was very controversial because it fought against a lot of the traditionalist ideas Afghan society held important (women being property of their husbands and all that). You can even see pictures from early 80s Afghanistan of women wearing mini-skirts.\n\nOf course, the most traditionalist groups of society (ultra-Islamic) heavily opposed the communist government for all that, and started violently revolting. The US saw that as an opportunity to defeat the communist government, and started heavily supporting those groups.\n\nThose groups won, instated a new Islamic government held by two branches: political (Taliban) and militar (Al-Qaeda) and then started attacking their old allies, the USA, because they saw them as anti-Islamic as the USSR.\n\nThose attacks of course culminated on September 11th 2001, which made the Bush administration start the invasion on Afghanistan\n\nEven though the Talibans were fastly defeated, they were never able to take down Al-Qaeda. This was mainly because Al-Qaeda outsmarted them plenty of times, and by 2003 (with the Iraq war starting), the US military decided to stop chasing Al-Qaeda and just stay in Afghanistan in defensive positions to help the government they reinstated after the defeat of the Taliban.\n\nHowever, the new government was very very weak and had no real power outside of Kabul, so the rest of the country was run by warlords (many of them related to Al-Qaeda), so it was a matter of time the Taliban were refounded and tried to take full control back of their country.\n\nTL;DR: Not only did the US fund the Taliban in the beggining, they spent years in a war trying to defeat them with very little success",

If we had been, we could have pulled out without fear of our puppet government falling to the government we overthrew with no cohesive plan to replace it. \n\nAlso the way that we pulled out of Bagram Base was superiorly fucked up. We shut the power off, fled under darkness, abandoned millions of dollars of assets and supplies, didn\u2019t tell the new CO we were gone until after we were gone, left all of the interpreters who worked with our forces unprotected against political assassination and imprisonment, and didn\u2019t allow the puppet government the chance to learn to function without us. \n\nAnd for all that, the only thing we have to show for it is a semi-destroyed country, two wasted decades (chasing down a culprit that not only wasn\u2019t in that country to begin with, but who we later invited to the White House), and trillions of wasted dollars that could have gone toward healthcare, housing, education, roads and dams and bridges, clean water, or any of the other 30 basic necessities that literally every other industrial nation besides China and Russia grants their citizens.",
            "Theres a film you should go and watch called Charlies War,\n\nEssentially in the 1980s Russia tried to invade Afghanistan and wipe out the local population. The USA supplied cheap firearms and RPGs to help destroy helicopters and kill Russians making the war in Afghanistan far too expensive for the Russians to carry out. This massacre of Afghan troops left a roughly 50% of the population under age and extremely vulnerable to extremism. What we're seeing today is essentially the fall out of that extremism.\n\nThe americans did a good and cost effective thing, but then essentially the middle east became awash with cheap weaponry and extremism because no one wanted to come in and educate the local population. So no one really wanted to take responsibility for it. You could argue that the USA supported the Afghans then abandoned them when they needed the help the most. They needed support, infrastructure and education to combat things like extremism. But what we're seeing today is essentially a small minority of people with a whole lot of power and weapons. I mean, Kabul fell in a day to a couple hundred men when it has a population of over 1 million.\n\nI dont blame the USA, i just think a small minority of people used the wars in the middle east to make money and kept it going for profiteering like Vietnam. I think the problem should have been fixed with education and funding. Just like what China are doing now in africa, supplying engineers and money for infrastructure in exchange for contracts and access to resources. Thats what the USA should have done, but the politicians at the time weren't interested in the next 40 years, they were just interested in beating the Russians, which they did in an extremely cost efficient manner.\n\nI dont blame  USA troops, general population. I blame greedy politicians  and weapons manufacturers.",

After 20 years, the Taliban is set to control an even larger part of the Afghan soil than they did before 2001.

From the ole writing answers on their hands, to actually singing in their native language, claiming they were praying, even after the local official who understood them called them on it.

Not even for a good reason, they would just steal everything, and sell it somewhere. He said they would give entire bases to the Afghanistan military, and when they got them back, there would be entire blocks completely stripped, because they would just steal *everything*.\n\nIt sucks that the US fought for 20 years for essentially nothing, but we just have our own politicians to thank for that. The military is it\u2019s own entity, but it was the elected officials who signed off on, sent them, and kept them there.\n\nNow their religious dictators are coming back, and it\u2019s their problem to deal with.

            "Resume is for people to read. Form fields make you searchable in the database.\n\nDon't fret, though. SW that parses resumes and creates database entries automatically is super hot shit. So hot that the first company to create a good solution will win all the money.\n\nThat headache will be gone in some years.",
            "The form is programmed to make it easier for them to find keywords.  \nThe way you lay out your resume can tell things about you - how creative you are, what things you choose to list first, what info you edited out of your resume, but showed up in the prompted fields, etc.",
            "For the same reason you go to the doctors office and have to tell 25 different people what you\u2019re suffering from.",
            "So there are rules laid out by the government for hiring and managing resumes. https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ofccp\n\nOne of the rules is that if you get 100 applicants and 100 resumes, and you open one of those resumes, then you should open the other 99 as well to ensure that you are being fair. If you are audited, someone will ask why you opened that particular resume and not another one.\n\nSo, companies try to collect as much information on forms that can be used to reduce the amount of viable candidates.They also use things like assessments. Forms can be put into tables and then the tables can be analyzed for keywords to reduce the amount of viable candidates. (always put keywords in your application/resume/form)\n\nMost major recruiting systems have a flag that tells you when a resume is viewed. Imagine if you had 1000 applicants and some bozo opened one of the resumes. Now you have to have a good reason for that or you have to spend the time reading the other 999 resumes. That takes a lot of time and money.\n\nInterestingly, taking a completely randomized sample is a legitimate way. If you have 5000 applicants, you can have a computer randomly pick 50. As long as there is no bias in the selection of those 50 candidates, it is not a problem. So if you ever felt like someone didn't even read your application, they might not have.\n\nThe reason these systems are in place is because there are people who will only read resumes by people with white sounding names or people with male sounding names. They will never open or read a resume from a Tyrone or a Laquisha.\n\nSo why do you have to enter all that information when it is already in your resume? Racists. Racists and Misogynists are the reason. They fuck shit up for everyone and make everything more difficult.",

            "Sometimes I think part of it is to thin out the application pool to the people who will put in more effort than just uploading their resume. Some people will apply to literally any posting they see in the hopes of landing an interview somewhere (and I don't blame them, times are desperate right now). Adding a second step to the process discourages this approach and shortens the number of applications HR has to go through. \n\nAlso, yeah, our robot overlords still need a bit of assistance with natural language processing.",
            "A combination of laziness and bad design, sort of like why so many online forms ask for the city, state, and zip when any search engine can tell you the city and state from the zip alone. \n\nIf the HR departments of the world would just tell us how to format a resume so it could be reliably 'read' by the software they use, then we could just submit the form and have the rest of the stuff autofill- but NOOOOOO. You gotta guess how to do this- even sites that claim that if you use 'THIS' format it will import cleanly often results in mangled results. \n\nHiring people complain about the mangled results and hard to read reports, made all the worse by getting hundreds of applications for some jobs. This is something that is REALLY broken, and no one seems to want to do anything about it.\n\nIt would be SO EASY to have a 'nice' resume you can attach for the organics to read, and a 'preformated' version for our robotic overlords to consume.",

            "Some applications will rip data from a submitted resume to make it easier for the applicant, but it's hard to parse a document for specific data when that document can be formatted in many different ways. Numbers and dates can be extracted fairly easily, but answers to other questions that employers want to know might be impossible for a typical website applet to parse.\n\nOne reason that applications online may ask you for all the data in your resume even though you've already submitted your resume is because there is most likely an automated sorting process or pre-screening of applicants that puts the most likely to be hired applicants on the \"top\", and just like I stated above this screening can't be done by parsing through a typical resume as it is very difficult to parse.\n\nAnother reason is that, well, not everyone has a resume to submit. For most jobs the resume is for the employer to have in hand during the interview, and probably is not even looked at before that. It's much more accessible for users to be able to answer simple questions in a list than to go and type up a resume. Now of course for higher positions this is recommended or even explicitly required to type up a resume, but for a lot of typical jobs you do not need a resume.",
            "Most companies use software to help the hiring team reduce the large amount of candidates down to a managable size using filters. They need the data in the form for the filter to work, they cant easily extract the from resumes so they ask the candidae to do it for them. \n\nFor example remove candidates who dont have qualication prerequisites. Remove foreign candidates who dont have a work visa and so on.\n\nBut the hiring team, especially the interviewer still wants to see your realume that you submitted because it speaks to who you are as a person and as a candidate for a position. It shows your style, your grammer, your creativity and your organization skills.  A resume provides insight into what a candidate feels is 'acceptable' when the stakes are high.\n\nResumes are only one piece of the hiring puzzle but it says a lot about a candidate.\n\nI know candidates just want to blanket the world with reaumes and hope for the best because its quicker and easier, but if you submit without filling in the form you will likely be cut out of the running at the first pass of the filters.",

The questionnaire asks where did you get that degree or skill, now you have to say \"I dont have that\" and you are dropped from the candidate list.\n\nSecond it is much faster for me to read the specific answers to the questions in one place then having to hunt through your resume to make sure you meet all the skills we are looking for.\n\nThird it is a great way to weed out people who cant follow directions. Our questionnaire specifically says \"do not write see resume\" you would be amazed how many people still write \"see resume\".

Then I will take the time to read those 40 resumes to make sure they match up with what they said in the questionnaire.  Then its on to short listing, I probably want to get that 40 down to say 15 or so for the testing round we typically use essays. They have to be scored individually so you dont want too many.
