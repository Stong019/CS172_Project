Firstly they can't tell the truth ie \"You suck\", or \"We strongly believe that you lied on your CV\" etc so they have to lie and say \"You were awesome, but we had a bunch of applications that were more suited\". Secondly when they send that email, no one wants to get involved in weeks of back and forth on how exactly somebody else could possibly have been better than them \"Did you even READ my CV?\". Thirdly they get legal letters and lawsuits etc over how they were discriminated against.\n\nTL/DR A lot of people forget that they ever even applied for a role... or just give up when they don't hear back... but when you reach out to say they were unsuccessful it can trigger a bunch of grief.",

            "Actual HR person here. There\u2019s a few reasons, though generally, any good HR (or person initiating/running the interviews) should attempt to let the person know. \n\nIt\u2019s difficult to give a straight forward answer, especially as it likely can change even just from industry to industry. For my industry (tech), here are some things that come to mind: they could be holding on to your resume because while you weren\u2019t the one offered the position on this round of hiring, we hire for that position often, and I\u2019m holding onto your resume in anticipation of an opportunity coming up later. I may also be making an offer to another party, and until they physically show up to work on their intended start date (people not showing up after accepting the job happens shockingly often) I won\u2019t call back other candidates because I may still offer them the job if someone else doesn\u2019t show. This can take time, you\u2019re often waiting at least 2 weeks for your new offer to start, and if they don\u2019t show up then you still need to review all other applicants again. Another issue, is in my country, you can fire an employee for no cause up to 3 months of employment. If our new hire sucks, I may go back to my first pool of candidates. \n\nPeople don\u2019t like to hear they weren\u2019t the first choice, so HR prefers to just look \u201cslow\u201d when in reality there\u2019s a ton of moving parts happening behind the scenes. The interview process isn\u2019t perfect either. People are flaky, people interview better than they work, people lie. You\u2019re dealing with humans, not machines or computers where you can predict behaviour. If I email you to say you didn\u2019t get the job, then an opportunity presents itself for you, you\u2019re probably not going to come work for me when I come back to you tail between my legs offering you a job. \n\nWith all of that said, I still do try to make contact at the first reasonable point to all people interviewed. I don\u2019t contact everyone who applied, because I\u2019d be emailing at times 100+ people. However, a lot of what HR is doing is to save face. Or they\u2019re just lazy, which happens too.",

            "Recruiter here- it\u2019s just bandwidth. Recruiting performance is typically measured by how many people you hire and the quality of those hires. Spending time rejecting candidates (surprisingly time consuming considering I see ~400-1000 candidates per role and typically carry min 10 roles at a time) is arguably handicapping my own performance. It\u2019s time I could spend finding and closing someone else better suited for the role, which is also a very time consuming process. \n\nThat said, I\u2019ll always send feedback/rejections to those who I\u2019ve engaged with and interviewed. \n\nTLDR applicant pools are insanely saturated and recruiters aren\u2019t measured on this.",

It doesn\u2019t happen often but occasionally I get the occasional \u201cfuck you\u201d when I send a rejection email.

Sometimes if I have feedback I can provide I certainly try to (maybe tweak this in your resume or looking for more experience in X area). Unfortunately at times I\u2019m at the mercy of a manager. Ex. A candidate applies that legitimately meet all of the criteria for the role. I send application to manager asking if I should set up an interview. Manager responds that they are not interested in candidate. I ask for feedback as to why and no response. I call and email again. No response. I don\u2019t want to let candidate dangling about the role so I let them know \u201csorry you were not selected.\u201d It always sucks because I have no other message I can provide outside of manager was not interested and not entirely sure why.\n\nTLDR: a little bit of everything from volume, bad past experience, or managers lack of communication/feedback",

I contemplated for a while emailing everyone with a form email, but was too scared I might get caught.

            "Former IT person now working HR, specifically in Talent Acquisition for a Fortune 500. I don't work the recruiting side, but I oversee our systems as a part of my job.  \n\n\nI don't want to overshadow that this sucks. But there a bunch of reasons this can happen.\n\n* Volume will drive a fair amount of this conversation - I previously worked for a different Fortune 500 company in HR and recruiters were KPI'd to be handling about 10 reqs at a time, the average applicant rate for which was 20 people. If they responded to every rejected applicant that's about 1/10 of their working time. And they were typically handling 12 reqs at a time. Why does it take that long because . . .\n* IF your ATS can handle automated messaging, it's probably only semi-automated. Meaning the recruiter has to actively choose to send the message to each applicant and preview the content. Some of this is because recruiters are individually dispositioning each candidate. Also . . .\n* There are lots of reasons not to message candidates: not having information from the hiring manager on why they're rejecting them, the risk they call or email back to find out more, the risk they will got to social media/the press, wanting to re-pool a candidate for another job, etc. AND . . .\n* If your ATS can handle automated messaging, you then have to set and maintain a boatload of policy about how this happens. If recruiters are manually messaging candidates they can use judgement, but you have to systematize that if you go automated. Things like - should we send a message to the person who cursed out a recruiter? If so, how long do we wait? Should it include the reasoning? The workload actually eats more Sr. Mgr/Executive time and therefore becomes exponential, and . .\n* If you're lucky, your ATS is maintained by a single dedicated sysadmin. 1 person who handles EVERYTHING about your ATS. Data, configurations, coordination, contracting support. I've been trying to get a relatively minor change coordinated for 3 weeks, but there's just a ton of other stuff that is more important. This is especially painful because . . .\n* Applicant Tracking Systems are the low-point of HR software. Even the top tier providers have pretty severe limitations that baffled me as someone w/ consumer software experience. One of the top 5 ATS in the US can only transfer 1 record at a time through it's API.\n* And even if everything is all setup correctly then you can still end up with messages delayed until the requisition closes, the avg time in the US for this is about 60 days.\n* Or sending incorrectly, because again these systems are not top-notch.\n* If your company doesn't have an ATS, or one that can handle automated messaging, your company is probably so small that you are not dedicated to recruiting, which means messages like this end up even lower on your longer priority list. The guy who just peed on your customers door because he got yelled at because he's late is definitely a higher priority.\n\nTL/DR - The value for the worker/company vs the difficulty and risk of doing so is not in our favor as applicants.",

And having an automatic email sent our requires extremely specific and sophisticated software in place that doesn\u2019t really benefit the company.

I have to hire about 5 students but I got 40+ applicants and it\u2019s difficult to really review everyone\u2019s applications, resumes, pick out people who you like, look at their availability, communicate to set up interviews, and still remember to communicate with the ones who didn\u2019t make the cut at the time.

            "Because HR people are some of the biggest assholes on the planet.",
            "Because it is hard.  There are often many, many applicants for a position.  Emailing each applicant is not realistic.\n\nAutomation is non-trivial.\n\nI do agree that it sucks, but honestly I think it'd be more practical for companies to set appropriate expectations in job postings (e.g. \"Due to the volume of applications that we receive, we cannot respond to each applicant.  If we choose to move forward with your application, expect to receive a response within 10 business days.\").",
            "Look at it this way, they work for the employer. That's who they have to keep happy. Unless there is a reason that benefits them in their employer's eyes, they aren't going to take time out of their day to do it. \n\nYes it can be automated. It's a standard function in most recruitment systems. Easy to implement. But it had to be implemented. Some companies don't see the value in it. Some may be in the \"we're soooo unique we couldn't possibly automate this process, every recruitment process is as different as one snowflake is to another\". \n\nIn my view both are the result of sloppy or lazy thinking. \n\nI have to say that I get a response (even if it's, thanks for your interest, but in this instance you were not successful) from most applications. \n\nMaybe I'm just lucky in applying to places that value the experience applicants have as a form of customer experience.",
            "It's 'cause, \"who gives a shit, they don't work for us, they'll ask us why, we can't tell them the truth, and we forgot who's who and why they didn't rate\". Cost benefit just doesn't weigh up.",

We have a system that makes it really easy to send a rejection notice, we opt not to use it and here's why, it's rare but people actually freaking out calling or showing up causing a scene on why they weren't hired \"I'd be a better fit that Z employee\"!. Just because they wouldn't work out for us now doesn't mean they wouldn't in the future usually due to thier availability or or the type of shifts we're short on changing.",
            "To add to what others are saying, most applicants will simply not show up and not call if for any reason they've changed their minds about accepting the job, which makes it similarly difficult or inconvenient for people on the HR end of things. When most of the times someone changes their minds, you go through the frustration of not knowing why they didn't show up or why they won't answer calls, you won't feel particularly incentivized to send an email or call when you've changed your mind about hiring someone.",
            "Actually, at the many large financial firms they do send out an automated email in case you are not selected eventually. May come a few weeks later. But they don't respond right away for a simple reason that they may interview hundreds of people for different jobs. Responding to each candidate that was not selected can take time. And they are get paid to select and hire, not spend hours replying to everyone who did not get selected.",
            "I do a lot of applicant screening and 1st interviews where I work. I'm never the person who has the final say on whether or not a person is hired - it's my supervisor's boss who makes the decision.

I know it sucks being left hanging.",
            "I've done a lot of hiring and firing. I would expect to get a call from the applicant if they didn't hear from me right away. I could tell them the position was filled or hire them as needed. Sometimes I would want to hire them but there is not an opening at that moment. Job seekers: Always call back and remind people who you are. Just be reasonable about it. The only thing to avoid is resending a resume multiple times, calling obsessively or showing up all the time thinking it's the way to go. I don't like people doing my job for me or trying to make me feel like I don't know what I'm doing. And don't flirt. It always made me feel uncomfortable. Women too. Don't do it!",

            "I actually choose to go into HR, specifically recruiting, because of this. It's not right to leave someone dangling once a position has decidedly been filled. And technology makes it easy to send a message to everyone who applied.\nThat said, I can't say why people don't do this because I specifically chose to work for a company that notifies all candidates once the job has been filled. It's still a mystery to me.",
            "Sometimes they have a tremendous amount of applicants and it's not possible to reply to all of them.  Other times, the job position has been filled even before the job listing has been posted on indeed, etc.  This is so some companies can maintain nonprofit status.  They have to at least post the job listings publicly even though internally it was filled.",
            "Because people argue.",
            "From my understanding, they keep your info in case they have another position you might be interested in. That's how one company called me for a different position than the one I applied for, I liked it better than the job I had actually applied for too, and paid more",
            "Because they don't have to. It sucks.",
            "This is a pet peeve of mine. When I was in a hiring position, I made it a point to contact all my interviewees to let them know we chose someone else. Just common decency. This was before email was a thing. Nowadays, it's even easier to do. Let them know you chose another candidate and let them know why whenever possible.",
            "Nobody cares anymore",
            "One job I applied for, I couldn\u2019t even get a response after emailing them saying I had another offer but wanted to see if this company was going to make one.\n\nThis was after the interviews went very well.",
            "My HR doesn't do this but after I have found my candidate, I send an e-mail to all the others I interviewed but had to reject. Thank them for their time, let them know why they didn't make it, and hope it helps them with their next interview, and so they will not continue to wait."

I also just hated the connection my whole name had to a family I didn't know much about and resented for various reasons.\n\n\nSo when I got old enough, I debated changing my first name, since my mom was so proud of it, so instead I met it halfway and gave myself a middle name and changed my last name.

            "Yo, used to be one of the guys who threw hotdogs to you. Don't bother with no fancy cooking techniques, it's a damn hotdog. \nHere's your recipe for success:\n\n - Hotdogs in a stadium (at least the one I worked at) are cooked on rollers, like the kind you see at a gas station. So, since I assume you don't have one of those, pan fry it. Grilling hot dogs is nice but it can dry them out.\n - Once that is hot (I mean hot, but not on fire. It shouldn't burn on contact but to the point where it gets uncomfortable REALLY quickly if you are touching it), put it in the bun. Normal old bun, nothing artisanal or fancy. Make sure it fits the dog, that's it. Nestle it in there so it isn't peeking out too far forward, back, or to one side. Center that fucker on 2 dimensions.\n - Wrap it, with tin foil. This is the MOST IMPORTANT part. You want the firm (but not too tight) wrapping to keep the moisture inside and heat the bun. Don't heat the bun beforehand, you want the dog to heat it.\n - Keep it warm. Toss the whole thing in an oven on low, or whatever other heating tools you have. Fuck, a crockpot would work I guess. Low heat, but keep the thing pretty warm. I find that the best hotdogs get to mature for at least 20 or so minutes, but fresh dogs are just fine.\n - If you use condiments, keep them warm. I know it sounds a little gross, but if you put mustard on your ballpark dog, I can tell you two things about that little mustard packet: It's been in my bag for the better part of a year, and it's been stuck under several hundred warm hotdogs for a lot of that time. \n - For authenticity, squish it a bit. I packed my bag like I was packing a suitcase, more dogs in the bag less travel time and more commission for me. Ya want a bit of squish in them anyway, it makes the bread a bit more dense.",
            "I have done this and discovered 1 method that works pretty well. No I do not have THE answer, but this will get you there most of the time. \n\nShopping List:  \n- Nathan's Hotdogs.  \n- any cheap bun (New England Style if you are in NE. DUH!)  \n- Aluminum foil (The thinner the better or individual sheets.)  \n\nCooking  \n- Boil them in a shallow pan in maybe 1/4 inch of water.  \n- allow the water to boil off  \n- (BONUS STEP) Steam the buns above the boiling water if you have a steamer basket otherwise do not worry too much about this step.)  \n- turn the heat to medium-low as the water is about to boil off  \n- Allow them to get some slight browning 60 seconds rolling around a little.  \n- (THIS is the most important step) Place them in the buns and wrap each dog in foil, leave set for 5-10+ minutes.  \n\nIf you are cooking 8+ stack all the foil wrapped dogs together.  \n\nOpen and enjoy. Nathans tends to be what many places use and having them wrapped in foil for 5-10 minutes should complete the process.  \n\nDo not be too gentle, push them a bit, squeeze the bun a little. The tight wrap, harsher handling, and steam are all what combine to make the ballpark hot dog scent.   \n\nKeep in mind other aspects of street/park dogs.   \n- Condiments are almost always Heinz.  \n- The dogs are usually basic Nathans  \n- They are made quickly and in bulk and sit in a warmer/steamer for a long time before being cooked and after  \n\nSo cooking like this is some 5 star restaurant will make the experience worse. Cook like a frustrated 16 year old with a douche boss at their first job, but trying to not get fired.  \n\nI for one do not care about name brands and such. I buy all store brand and cheap vs flavor where I can find the right balance.  \n\nBut when I want a dog that tastes like it came from the street, these are the best methods I have found.",
            "Get 100% beef hotdogs.",
            "I am going to assume that ballpark dogs sit in well seasoned hotdog water for at least a half an hour before put on a bun and wrapped in foil. It's probably in the foil for at least 15-30 minutes and under a heat lamp and in an insulated bag before it gets to you. They don't steam the bun but this time in the foil and in transition allows the hot hotdog to steam the bun itself. The bun soaks up a lot of flavor and by this time the dog is probably tenderized after cooking in the water and in the foil conditions while in transition.",

            "I know this will get horribly buried but I'm shocked I haven't seen this answer yet. I don't know where people are getting this 'steam the bun' stuff from, as someone who actually worked in a ballpark..there's no way your buns were literally ever steamed. *Almost* guaranteed. From a concession standpoint, it's an absolute waste of time, space, and resources. \n\nThe hotdogs are the ones that get steamed. Concession stands frequently use steam machines with big sliding trays in them where you can load up like 100 hotdogs at a time. Toss water in the bottom and hit the timer, 10 minutes later you have plump, juicy, and fully cooked hotdogs.\n\nThe rollers that you see at the ballparks typically aren't actually cooking the hotdogs, they're keeping them warm. If they *are* using them to cook, the hotdogs will be shrunken, wrinkly, and gross. Like the ones you see at gas stations after they've been rolling for hours.\n\nSo to answer your question: Steam the hotdogs. You could easily make do with a veggie steaming tray or something like that where you just pop it on top of a boiling pot. Steamed buns are definitely nice too, but I guarantee you that the steamed dogs will get you that ballpark taste you're looking for.\n\nSource: On and off hotdog jockey for 10+ years",

            "Generally teaching kids another language is helpful, but there\u2019s no real reason it has to be ASL specifically. Languages tend to be a use it or lose it thing, so it\u2019s not like you\u2019re going to have a large population suddenly conversational in ASL. (How many people still remember any of their high school Spanish?)",
            "Back in the late 70\u2019s / early 80\u2019s, when I started public elementary school, our school had a pilot program where we learned alongside deaf children our age, which included the teachers signing as they spoke, & us learning sign language along with our other lessons. When I look back on it now I realize how revolutionary it was for the time, but at the time I just thought that\u2019s what you did. I can still sign with the fluency of a smart second grader. (We moved)",
            "It's not as useful as learning a second language that is more used, but I agree with you that kids should learn their equivalent sign language in their country.\n\nTo teach it, you'd need a fluent ASL user which also speak English, which aren't exactly in surplus. That isn't the same as bilingual in say Spanish and English",
            "There\u2019s only so much room in the curriculum. I suppose a school could opt to treat it as an option for foreign language, but then it needs enough interest from the students to justify adding a teacher to the payroll and it would need a room",
            "According to google, there are only 600k deaf people in the US compared to 41 million native Spanish speakers. Google also notes that half of that 600k are over the age 65, meaning they wouldn't necessarily know sign language anyway.",

I love mine.\n\nSpanish is more useful if you need to learn a language.",
            "> But from what I\u2019ve seen asl can broaden a persons language skills and improve their learning experience overall. \n\nI'd assume the same way as learning any other second language, which *is* taught, and is much more commonly, and more easily used. Most people are never going to have to communicate with someone who they could use sign language with in the first place. The best situation would be if every school had the option of teaching everything, but that's an impossible wish.",
            "One of the reasons could be that sign language isn\u2019t universal.

English sign language come in grammatically exact forms used for dictation which teach signs for each word and punctuation; and inexact dialect forms which are non-standard local forms using simplified language with an emphasis on expression. Neither of these provide the benefits that foreign language learning provides in parts of speech so they aren't a viable substitute. \n\nKnowing a common sign language with your peers would be generally useful for students for everything from quiet communication across a noisy classroom to collaborative work in the library even with no deaf children present. Unfortunately its usefulness does not tie in well with other school needs sufficiently to be introduced across the board.",

I know plenty of parents that used common words to help their children communicate before speech.

I mean maybe a couple hours to cover some basics would be useful, but for any more than that I don't think you could really justify spending the time for a skill that most people will never really need. Even if it would improve overall learning, is it worth it compared to the amount of work you put into it compared to other skills you could teach to achive the same goal?  \n\nI mean people talk about how school teaches them stuff that they never use and sign language would just add to the pile so to speak.",

            "Because people tend to think of ASL as a language exclusively for HOH or deaf people.

If you watch *For a Deaf Son*, you'll see how Thomas Tranchin's parents' hearts were broken when they found out their son couldn't hear. They acted like their own son was broken, then went on to put him through hearing classes, rather than the deaf classes that were easily available and could have enabled him to find his own community.\n\nSource: I just finished my first semester of ASL and our professor loved to tell us about deaf culture, history, and discrimination.",

            "As a 6th grade teacher who\u2019s been teaching for 14 years, I do believe there are a few reasons that ASL is not taught as part of a child\u2019s regular education. First, there is not enough time built into a regular school curriculum for it. Teachers have a lot to cover in a very short time...there is simply not enough time to teach something like ASL and still do a normal curriculum. Second, there is no money budgeted for already-stressed teachers to cover teaching it. Thirdly is need/demand. Currently, around 3 children in 1000 are born with any kind of measurable hearing loss. Similar numbers also exist for school-age kids with hearing loss/impairment. There is simply no real need for ASL education among children with normal hearing. Fourth, there are schools that exist in several cities, in all 50 states, that teach hearing-impaired children exclusively. They run in tandem with regular schools in terms of curriculum and overall education. Long story short, there\u2019s no time, no money, and no real need for ASL to be taught as part of a regular education.",

I know basic signs and I've used it twice in my life - once for a guy who was faking any possible illness / disability he could just for the sake of being awkward, and the second guy didn't sign and used technology instead. I guess in this day and age, everyone can write things on their phone so it's easy enough to understand what people want to communicate to you, plus some deaf people can read lips (before masks!) so there isnt as much reliance on signs as a way of communicating.",

            "I am a librarian and I strongly encourage parents to incorporate sign language when speaking with their infants. Verbal language skills take quite a bit of time to develop, however your baby will pick up signing much quicker.

            "ASL actually is intentionally not taught to deaf children sometimes! This may have changed since I left the deaf schooling system, but for my sister and I who attended a deaf school in Southern California from 1998-2003, we actively were not allowed to learn ASL. The school of thought at the time was that deaf children who were given hearing devices would not learn to listen and speak if they could rely on ASL. Nowadays, I think people realize what a flawed concept that is due to research showing that children who learn more than one language actually have a greater capacity for language going forward in their lives. But if even educators specifically for the deaf could not agree on teaching ASL to the PRIMARY users of ASL, I think we\u2019ve got a long way to go before it\u2019s considered a fundamental language the way French and Spanish are in American schools.",

And statistically, a very small portion of society is deaf/mute, so knowing SL won't really bring a huge benefit later in life.\n\nKids are much better off using their time and resources(both of which are limited) learning a foreign language, which broadens their cultural and social horizons and opens them up to various job and life opportunities later on.",

It's estimated that only 250,000 to 500,000 people speak it, compared to 280 million French speakers for example.

            "Same answer as every other \"why don't they teach ___ in school\" question - because there's only so many hours in the day, kids only have the capacity to learn so much, and sign language isn't something the teachers necessarily know how to teach.  \n\nMost of early education is teaching social and learning skills, and losing some of that to teach sign language isn't necessarily a good trade off.  You can't just add everything that might be valuable to a kid's education.  There's a ton of stuff that would be great to teach, but if you're going to suggest new things to teach kids in school, you need a plan for what you're going to stop teaching kids in school.",

You may also live in an area with a lower deaf population, and therefore have not had an interaction with a Deaf individual. If you lived in an area with a higher Deaf population, you would encounter many more Deaf individuals that use ASL as their primary mode of communication (such as near a school for the deaf). I think the importance of learning any language largely has to do with your surrounding populations; if you live in an area with a heavy influx of Mandarin speakers, it would be more useful for you to learn Mandarin than ASL. I just hope ASL will be recognized as a true language (because it is, a naturally developed language with all the 5 parameters of language) instead of being pushed aside as lesser than spoken languages. If you don\u2019t see a need to learn ASL, then don\u2019t! As for OP\u2019s question, I think it depends on the area or school. As many said, it depends on necessity and resources, which teachers have limited resources as it is, so unless they already know ASL, it may be difficult to incorporate it into a mainstream public school setting and not high on the priority list. However, if a school is near a school for the Deaf, I could see it being more feasible, as the children may interact more often with Deaf individuals (recreational sports might have Deaf children or parents involved, for example).",
            "I honestly believe we should decide on a singular sign language and utilize it globally . If a lot of different countries taught it in schools, we'd be able to break language barriers that would've otherwise existed.

            "My grandpa had traits of Asperger\u2019s and so did my uncle, but it was never diagnosed because my family doesn\u2019t \u201cbelieve\u201d in it. \n\n\nMy cousin had been taken to the doctor by her parents, they told them she had autism. they left the office saying that was bullshit and that they didnt \u201cbelieve\u201d in that. \n\n\n\nMy mom silently suffered through depression and almost killed herself and my dad and my siblings would have never understood why because she never talked about it. A friend helped her get medical help because that\u2019s the only person she trusted when it came to her depression. \n\n\nMy sister asked to go to therapy when she was 8-10 years old and my dad told her no. She had a good life, why the hell would she need to go to therapy? \n\n\nI got diagnosed with depression and anxiety at the age of 15 and was visibly struggling. I went from being a straight A student to getting Cs and Ds. I no longer had interest in my extracurriculars. I had outbursts and crying spells all the time. It was very obvious that I was not okay. \n\n\n\nWanna know what my dad did? He said to not worry. I had a good life, why should I be sad an anxious? I had clothes on my back and food on the table, clearly means there\u2019s no reason to be depressed. I had it better than others so I was just looking for attention. \n\n\nHis ignorance could have led to a suicide (I was definitely on my way there) so thank god I had my mom who knew what was happening to me.

That is definitely something that is overlooked. Y\u2019all are 100% correct. Just because it worked for me, it doesn\u2019t mean it will work for everyone else. Treatment for mental health is not a monolith. That is probably one of the most important things to note.

After a while, people stopped caring as much, and let children use whatever dominent hand they naturally used. \n\nThus, when being left handed wasn\u2019t accepted, there were very few left handed people. But now? There are way more.  \n\nMental illnesses always existed, but acceptance and treatment for them did not. Now there are way more ways to diagnosis and treat mental illnesses, and thus it seems like more people have them. \n\nWhy does it seem like young people are more likely to have them?

            "Partly, it's just that there's less stigma about it. I know a lot of older adults who *clearly* have mental health issues, but self-medicate with alcohol abuse or sublimate it into severe anger issues (\"My parents beat me as a child and I turned out fine!\" Oh really? Is that why you're screaming obscenities at the 16 year-old cashier for forgetting your fries? Yeah, you *definitely* turned out fine and don't have any issues at *all)*\n\nBut beyond that, I think there's also just a lot of sources for mental health issues these days. \n\nA lot of young people are under-socialized due to the decline of available public spaces, the decline of clubs and social organizations, a lack of disposable income to invest in hobbies compared to prior generations, and being forced into work schedules that impede their ability to socialize (I have friends in food service, for instance, that it's nearly impossible to schedule anything with because their schedules are constantly changing to all sorts of odd hours on short notice)\n\nYoung people tend to be under much greater financial strain than older people. Adjusted for inflation, an entry-level salary with a college degree in 1960 was $61,000. Today, it's $47,000 (thanks, Reagan), while housing and medical costs are astronomically higher and that same college graduate usually has tens of thousands of dollars in student loan debt. \n\nThen there's the climate crisis. Older people tend to be largely unconcerned about it, since they know they'll be dead before things get too bad. Those who expect to still be alive in 2080, on the other hand, will have to actually face the consequences of the older generation's decisions. \n\nSo those are a few of the reasons",

We're traumatized as a species at this point.\n\n3. Until alarmingly recently, the norm was for people to be institutionalized and fully drugged if they made concerning statements or acted at all oddly. \n\n4. We have better diagnostic tools than even five years ago, let alone 10 or more.\n\n5. Insurance is more willing to pay for meds than therapy. Probably this more than anything in terms of the pills.

However, if a mentally ill patient doesn't respond to known treatments, we still use those same treatments regardless, and disregard the outlier as an outlier.\n\nThat's why clumping all scientific studies together as \"science\" is foolish. Some scientific fields have stricter rules to adhere to than others. Meaning, some are more foundational than others.\n\nPills, currently, are our best guess to the solution. Will they be 200 years from now? Probably not. In fact, they'll probably reticule and make fun of our treatments for mental illness in the future, and discuss how much damage we did to ourselves in our ignorance.\n\nAnd, it's massively profitable. And a point like that should never be left out.\n\nBasically, 200 years from now, they most likely will not make fun of our knowledge on geology, chemistry, or mathematics, as they have very strict scientific definitions to uphold. However, they will probably make fun of our knowledge of psychology, sociology, philosophy, and mental illness.\n\nEveryone's probably on pills, because a lot of people are being misdiagnosed, because the entire field that has that responsibility, are just operating with what they're guessing, and can ignore outlaying data as outliers, rather than being forced to address the outliers.",

Throwing desks/feces and biting teachers is much more common now. This pretty much does nothing but drag down the other kids who have the ability to excel in a standard classroom environment.\n\n Some kids have minor issues that could probably be dealt with without taking a pill, but it is easier and less stressful for all involved to medicate.\n\nThen there are definitely those kids who should be medicated, and some are not or only take their medication sporadically. \n\nSo in the end, it is more acceptable now to take a pill to alter one's state and to be in the public eye while suffering from mental illness. I think it should be a person's choice (taking medication), so that is ok if it provides the results the individual is looking for.",

            "I've been working from home for about ten years. Finding a dedicated space as my \"office\" that I refuse to enter when I'm not on the clock made a huge difference. If you can't do that because you don't have the space, un-packing and packing up your work each day and putting it into a bag or drawer (or even covering your workspace with a blanket) helps to make you feel like work is at work and home is at home.\n\nAlso, getting dressed in different clothes to \"go to work\" helped my brain make the switch as did \"commuting\" to work by taking a 20 - 30 minute walk through the neighborhood to start and end each day.\n\nFinally, when you're at work, be at work. It's tempting to kind of mix work and home tasks throughout the day, but then you run into the issues you've already noted and others have mentioned about separating things. IMHO, lack of separation between work and home is a big problem and burns you out.",
            "Part of working from home is figuring out how to delineate between your work life and your personal life, or else you start to feel like you\u2019re always on the clock and yet you accomplish much less in your work. It\u2019s good to set up a place for work time that you can physically leave once you\u2019re done. Then don\u2019t check email until the next day, if possible. \n\nPart of it also depends on your job and your coworkers. If you feel engaged in what you do and who you work with during the day you\u2019ll feel energized by the end of the day. If you\u2019re disengaged and bored then it just makes your job exhausting. \n\nAlso, these are just tough times for everyone with the closures and social isolation. Don\u2019t get too hard on yourself if 2020 isn\u2019t a banner year for you. Just try to make it through in one piece.",

That said, here are a few suggestions I have, if you're not doing them already:\n\n* To whatever extent possible, completely shut down when your day is over. If you're done working at 5pm, at 5pm turn off your work phone, don't check email, etc. It's easy to drive yourself crazy if you're constantly \"on.\"\n* Try to set a concrete goal(s) you want to accomplish each day. I guess you could say this whether working from home or not, but I think holding yourself accountable like this helps keep you honest.\n* As someone else said, don't sweat it too much if you're not your normal, productive self right now. Yeah, you don't want to be a slug, but the truth is that everyone is doing their best just to keep afloat, to some degree. Don't be too hard on yourself.\n\nGood luck!",

I'm actually more productive from here.\n\nI hate that my climbing gym is closed, I can't take my motorbike out for an aimless ride, that i feel guilty for leaving the house - Even for essentials, that my favourite eateries are closed, That it's sunny as hell and my paddleboard is sat in the garage gathering dust and that most of my hobbies are outdoors but I'l not allowed there. \nI'm just getting bored of these four walls.\n\nHOWEVER!\n\nI sit here being bored, yet I'm doing my part in saving lives even if it's indirectly.  \n\nAs for advice - Get into a routine for your morning. Don't be waking up with 10 mins to spare and open your laptop while still in your underpants. Make sure you shower every day - That really refreshes the body and the mind.  \n\nAs for working out - Follow along with a Yoga, Pilates, Body Combat or something similar from youtube. Put it nice and big on your TV (If you don't have youtube on your TV, grab a Chromecast, and 'Cast' it from your computer). Try something new.\n\nAs for motivation - Now is the bestest time to ask yourself - What do you want in life? Your first answer will be 'I don't know'.  \nBut have a REALLY good think and be totally honest. No-one is in your head nor are they judging you, you have no-one to impress.  \nDo you want Money? Sex? Peace? Fulfilment? A nice Car? A Holiday? 6-pack ABS?  \n\nThis is the opportunity to work out how to get the thing that you want. Time to self-teach some new skills to progress in your job. Put together a business plan to become your own boss. Figure out a budget to save for the item/holiday. Work out a side-hustle to bolster that. Put together a workout plan to get the body that you want - Whatever it is. \nPoint is, once you know what you want it's straighforward to find resources online to help. If you find it's not working - No big deal, have another thing and try something else. \n\nBy all means don't tell the people around you if you feel your real goals are too materialistic, but this is your time to figure out a plan going forward.  \n\nOh and don't try all of it at once. Thats not sustainable, and you'll burnout quickly.

It is very important to follow a strict schedule.\nUsually the schedule is externally imposed by having to show up to work at a certain time, now you have to follow a self imposed schedule: work time, chill time, workout time, meal time and sleep time, all of them should be followed with extreme discipline. It seems insignificant but it adds up over many days.\n2. Stop waiting for the lockdown to get over.\nDon\u2019t think of the lockdown as a countdown, if you do that you are implicitly absolving yourself from the responsibility of adjusting to this new situation. You start hoping to just hold out till the end of the lockdown, however any extension that may be announced will cause great stress. You need to start finding small things that you enjoy during the lockdown, writing a daily journal about your emotions and things you should be grateful for is a great way to stabilise your emotional state.",

Of course you feel this way, your home has never been a place for work! It makes sense you're having some problems. Allow yourself to feel burnt out for a little bit. We can be really hard on ourselves and expecting yourself to push it away will make you feel more exhausted.  You don't have to come out of this completely in shape and super accomplished and on top of everything. Remove some pressure on yourself. And like others suggested, really try to separate work from home, physically and mentally, in as many ways as possible. Dedicate a desk for work, dedicate a time/schedule, dedicate a drawer, etc. And most importantly, forgive yourself for this burnout. You're only human. Nothing will end up helping if you don't forgive yourself for making mistakes. It's okay to feel burnt out, it makes perfect sense, and trust yourself that you can handle it :) good luck",

My advice is to designate a part of your home as your \"work space.\" Get up, get dressed, comb your hair, brush your teeth, have a cup of coffee, go through your morning ritual same as you would if you were going to work. When you \"come home,\" try to avoid coming back to your work space.\n\nPersonally I'm the opposite, I thrive in a work at home environment and I get a lot more done in my life than I did when I was working away from home. But I understand people are wired differently and this was advice given to me when I faced the same fears when I was about to make the switch. It gets easier, think about the time you are saving with commute alone, you can make this work and you can thrive, I believe in you!",

            "Start working out. Helped me feel a lot better about being at home all the time. Also I started drinking tea (I never really drink coffee so that helps perk me up and get motivated)",
            "Here's [an article](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51034111_Stuck_in_the_Middle_The_Psychophysics_of_Goal_Pursuit) on why motivation comes and goes. Note carefully that motivation lags in the middle when it is difficult to see the end.  Life has changed radically and it's difficult to \"see\" and end or a result right now.\n\nMy advice is to give yourself a break.  COVID-19 has stuck a huge stick in our bicycle spokes and we're all still picking ourselves up and assessing what condition we're in.  If you weren't feeling a bit of cognitive dissonance I'd be more concerned.  Think of all the expectations and plans you had which were suddenly stopped.  You should feel a bit of whiplash.  \n\nPart of what you're feeling may simply be the effect of slowing down.  Our culture (assuming you're in the US) has us running around excessively, confusing activity with progress like a hamster on a wheel.  Maybe slowing down isn't a bad thing.  Maybe, there's a new self directed rhythm you can establish.\n\nAre your goals realistic given the current situation? Are you confronting the new reality and perhaps reframing your goals?  Most importantly are you in touch with \"you\".\n\nOne thing that I've found that helps me (remote worker for 15 years) when I really don't feel like doing something is to work alongside someone else virtually.  Sometimes I'll open a conference bridge or video chat and help someone get their work done and then they help me.  We \"embrace the suck\" and get the work done as quickly as possible with high quality.  Misery loves company.\n\nLastly, your cadence has changed. You've been in a pattern for sometime and now that pattern has changed. It's not good or bad, just different. Give yourself the time to adjust.",
            "I've worked from home for 7 years. First note -- these are not normal work from home situations, and it's definitely harder than usual, so do cut yourself some slack.\n\nOn top of the other advice in this thread, a few things that work well for me:\n\n* Have a start of day ritual and an end of day ritual. This helps separate work time from home time. Start of day I get my coffee, water, turn on and then pause my email (so I don't get new ones coming in), think about my goals for the day, think about why I do what I do, and then start a pomodoro timer. End of day I plan out my goals for the next day, drink water, think about what I accomplished that day, deep breath, and literally say outloud my end of day slogan  (\"done and done\" -- this was a tip from a friend who used a different one, and I find it surprisingly helpful, even if silly). \n* No email outside of work hours.\n* Take lots of (planned) breaks throughout the day. I find pomodoro to be really helpful. During short breaks, I drink water, stand up, stretch, play with my dog.\n* I try to wake up a little early so I can do something I love before I start working. For me, that's reading while I drink my coffee. That way, my first thought when the alarm goes off isn't \"ugh, I have to go work now.\" It's \"yay, I want to get up so I can relax and read and have quiet time to myself.\" This can be a struggle for me because waking up is always hard, but I try to remind myself that it's doing myself a favor and will make me happy; I'll be tired when I wake up either way, so I might as well make time for something I like.\n* Plan times IN ADVANCE that you're going to not be working. Plan work time AROUND those times. Prioritize sleep, exercise, breaks, recreation. \n\nRemember that life will probably be like this for a while. For me, that's actually a helpful thought. It reminds me that the stuff to prioritize is the stuff that keeps you healthy and sane. Work can fit in in between.",

            "I think most people working from home, especially those living alone will feel jaded at the end of the day as they don't have that contact & interaction with work colleagues to break up the day. Even with taking coffee breaks or doing something else, it is still an isolating life & even phoning people isn't the same.

When quarantining first came in, I though I would do some work around the house (painting, small repairs, re organising rooms & furniture, gardening, etc.) but as hardware stores & garden suppliers are closed as not being essential, I can't get any of the things I need to do the work. I have opened a lot of boxes of clothes (I moved to SEA to live, 2 years ago) & laundered & repacked them away, as I can't even buy wardrobes & cabinets to store them in.\n\nAfter nearly 7 weeks of isolation (3 trips only to supermarkets to buy food & most of the things I wanted are out of stocks or sold already, so I have lost most of my motivation to do anything except be online, reading & eating (putting on weight too) & start looking forward to the end of the day & off to bed again. I miss being able to just close the shop & go for a walk to visit family/friends, especially the only other \"westerner\" in the small rural area where I live, just to \"chew the fat\" so to speak, in my own language. Still, we will get through it, in most cases, although there will be a lot of people who are going to need professional help to get over the restrictions, loss of jobs & any other problems that will occur when we get back to unrestricted living, which won't be normal, probably for a decade or maybe even a generation, especially financially despite what Trump is spouting.",

            "Working from home is a downer honestly. At first the idea was fun being able to work in pajamas, but after a while it started to suck. Like I couldn\u2019t just leave my work at work. Today I started my regular routine. Showering, getting dressed, taking a walk, having breakfast/lunch before my shift. It made a huge difference.\n\nWhat also helps me is by cutting off anything that involves my personal life. I don\u2019t draw at my desk waiting for a call, I don\u2019t keep the TV running, nor do I get up to do chores. My girlfriend stays with me part of the time, but she goes in the bedroom and does her own thing while I work. I need zero distractions from my personal life in order for me to work efficiently. My workspace is in my living room for now. I\u2019m moving it into my spare room tonight after getting a longer ethernet cord so I can work in a completely different room. We got this!",

Of course things come up and stuff changes. If I can\u2019t do something or finish it I move it at the end of the day..if it happens again I just keep moving it.\n\n\n\nI do small task on my break: break  1. Start the dryer lunch: put clean clothes on bed. 3. Start the washer. And fold clothes during a conference call if I have time.\n\nSmall task broken up through the day makes after work easier. Less house work = more exercise time.\n\nAfter I get off I either lay down for 30 minutes or immediately go for a run or work out.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t motivated to work out maybe try something different.

            "I spent 18 days in total isolation in China due to the Corona Virus. The first few days were rough, I had no motivation to do anything and I tried my best to quiet the voice in my mind that made me feel awful for being so lazy. After four days though, I confronted myself, and got sick of letting anxiety control me, so I made a schedule. I did as much as I could in the morning, and then spent my afternoons making goals and plans on how to use the time effectively. There are a lot of bad articles online telling you it's okay to do nothing, but if you do nothing, you learn nothing, and you gain nothing. Letting that voice of anxiety control your sense of guilt and turn it off for not trying to improve yourself is wrong. Let it bend you, not break you, otherwise you come out of this quarantine the same as before and see no progress. You will only truly be happy when you learn to take control of that voice and actually start making very slow progress.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1cnvEZVUzc",

It is crucial to you feeling like you are not only accomplishing things but are also *limiting* your work so that you do not feel burnt out from overworking. \n\nMotivation:  That is a tough one.  It sounds like you rely on others to motivate you.  That's not a criticism; different people work different ways.  I too need others to motivate me to exercise. I absolutely will not go to the gym alone, period. No workout buddy = no gym.  It's just how I am. Perhaps you need to use one of those virtual workout class things to get you moving?  Maybe you need to put \"Walk\" on your daily schedule at 1PM so you get out of the house each and every day, halfway thru the day so you stay refreshed?  \n\nThere are all kinds of possible answers here.  I would break down each problem you're talking about to find the root cause.  Compare what's happening now to what happened in the office and see which change is screwing you up.

If you\u2019re having a lull mid afternoon, use that time to exercise! Doing chores throughout the day is a super great way to force yourself to take breaks. I love taking walk breaks once every couple of hours. I make myself really good breakfasts and lunches too. Of course having a dedicated work space is key, but honestly reframing it to be what you can take advantage of by being home really helps too. \n\nKeep in mind too that if you had a really strong routine, it\u2019s going to take some time to get yourself into a new one. Be patient with yourself. These are also unprecedented and stressful times.

Now it\u2019s out of whack and you need to find a new equilibrium and reset your brain, like developing a tolerance to said high and learning to use effectively. Point being, many who customarily work from home have to some degree spent the initial transition dealing with this phase and finding that balance. Now, however people have to get their shit together a lot quicker than that and force themselves to focus (very unpleasant) or try the methods here but what you\u2019re experiencing doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re a lazy piece of crap, it\u2019s a completely natural phase to this sudden change.",

This was a couple weeks into lockdown where I live and let me tell you, not one person that had to do this program were happy. Anxiety everywhere.\n\nThe calling itself turned out to be easy and chill, hours were short with less strict without a must to do it perfectly, and we are still paid our wages without needing to deal with layoffs and government support. We also get to avoid forgetting how to use our systems as well as have something to do. But ever since starting it, I've felt more lethargic and unmotivated to do the things I enjoy, even though I had an easier time doing them after more demanding shifts from the store.\n\nCalls were inbound and not very frequent, so in between calls, technically you kind of are free to do whatever while you wait for the next one. At first I didn't want to bother starting anything else knowing I'll just be interrupted by a call and break my focus on whatever it was I was doing. But now I want to try to take baby steps by fitting in other activities mid shift when I have the most physical and mental energy due to the job, just like others on this thread have suggested regarding chores and such.\n\nIt does make me feel more accomplished so far.

But now, it\u2019s like we\u2019re running a power-hungry app in the background, draining our boundary. So, regardless of how many work-from-home hacks we use, you might just be a little more tired right now... and that\u2019s okay. Keep trying and also be gentle and kind to yourselves, my loves.",
            "I absolutely love it! No commute, no early mornings, I can work in my underwear, I can eat/drink whatever I want whenever I want, don't have to fake interest in a job I only do to pay the bills whenever the boss turns up, no uncomfortable chairs and shitty computers, cheaper lunch, I can end the day immediately when my quota is fulfilled instead of hanging around the office for another hour waiting for the time to run out.. \n\nAs far as I'm concerned this is much, much better than slaving away in a cramped office one hour commute away.",

Even on days when I manage to be fairly productive, I still don\u2019t feel accomplished and content. I don\u2019t know, man. I will probably go back to work in 2-3 week and I\u2019m way behind on my assignments, so that\u2019s stressing me out.",

I still hang out with my friends and we have an ecosystem of less than 10 people anyway so it still works out for all of us.",
            "I could very easily slip into depression if I get laid off. It seems that I regularly look forward to days off so I can catch up on XYZ, but once they arrive I do absolutely nothing. Most times I need to jump in the car to go somewhere, anywhere, just to drum up the motivation to get anything accomplished. I could literally waste the entire day laying on the couch, scrolling through various YouTube videos.",

            "I was for a bit. I have started to do more exercises and stretching to help my mental health.  I was feeling very depressed working from home and the prospect of the world.  Having the time set aside to workout and focus on myself has helped a lot. I'm not doing a ton of exercise, I go on walks early in the morning before I start working then try and stretch multiple times during the day. Dont get me wrong, I dont feel 100% better but every little thing can make a difference. I try and appreciate what I have and not focus on the negative.",
            "Everyone will be going through ups and downs. This is a big change in our daily routines. Routine changes like this can cause the mind problems as it is a sucker for a routine and loves to do the same thing over and over again. Perhaps your'e bored of your new routine already, you don't have enough excitement or reasons to complete what you're doing. I would try and figure out what you're actually trying to achieve, write it down, make it clear and exciting, along with the obvious things like daily walks, enough sleep and a good diet and you should start feeling better. In terms of expecting to stay motivated forever, that won't happen, you're used to your new situation, now is time to change it up where possible and realise that you won't always be motivated. Don't be motivated, be driven.",
            "The shift from at work to home work was tougher as time went on.\n\nLooking back, the leaving-the-house-to-work Ritual was what I needed the most. Simulate that ritual and go for a walk or do a chore before work if you can. But leave the house, even to the back yard for 20 to 30 mins, that's what most important.",
            "As someone who has worked from home for over 7 years I feel for you. One of the best methods is to keep work space and personal space separate. For me I only had one bedroom and it was my office as well so I had to have my work computer next to my personal computer. I kept them separate and played video games during any down time. This is how I got in to a game called Eve Online. I got in to \u201cmining\u201d which was low level of attention but let me still have fun while working. I would try to play other games but would run in to issues where I would pay more attention to the games than work which felt good at the time but cause the quality of work to suffer.\n\nMake sure you have work time and away time, it\u2019s good to spend time away from your work stuff so you can have time to recover. Keep a solid sleeping schedule, you\u2019ll be tempted to waking up seconds before you work because you can. Make sure you give your self at least an hour before you have to start working to fully wake up. \n\nAll else fails treat it like prison, keep looking forward to the end date, work out like a mother fucker, and do anything/everything you can to keep your mind busy.",
            "My dining table is now my workspace for 2 adults and 2 kids. I run an extension cable so that we can plug in out devices on the table.\n\nWhen it's lunch, all devices are packed and out comes the table cloth, dishes and cutlery. \n\nPost lunch, the kids are usually done so its just the missus and me. Out comes the laptop and that extension. When we \"clock out\" for the day, everything gets packed up and put away.\n\nWe have replaced commute time with stowing-stuff-away time. Our routines are pretty much set such that we dread Mondays and cheer for Friday. When the weekend comes around, hooray, no more taking out that damned extension cable.\n\nThat cable has become the symbolic difference between work and home. I guess you have to find your cable.\n\nLike so many have mentioned, having boundaries, even mundane ones, helps.",

            "Think that you're not simply working from home, you're in a crisis where you're lucky of being able to work from home. This is a pandemic, it's something new for all of us. It's normal to feel lost and not motivated. We're all like that in a way. It's ok.\n\n\nWe will pass this, I promise. Do your best in the mean time.",
            "I used to work remotely. Not from home over the internet, like in the middle of nowhere, essentially by myself with next to no social contact for extended periods of time.\n\nIt fucks you up. You brain starts getting \"mushy\" before two weeks are up, and things get really weird after four. This whole thing is going to psychologically traumatize a lot of people in ways that aren't going to be easy to predict.\n\nHaving a routine helps.",
            "I don\u2019t know if anyone\u2019s commented about this already but and having kids and being a stay at home parent, this is exactly how I feel. I went from a very stressful very demanding very exciting job to being at home with small children and I found myself in this predicament. My days all just sort of blend into one but it\u2019s incredibly demanding so that means there\u2019s no particular delineation from work to home. \nI imagine a lot of families are going through this at the moment where they\u2019re starting to feel strange not having the separation of church and state so to speak.",
            "I still have a few days at work. Im a restaurant employee. Its dumb. I use none of my skills and answer the same 8 questions over and over for the two days I work. Im in the dumps mate. The looming possibility that this shit is going to go ass over teakettle any time is always there. There is no joy in any of the work that there is. Sleep is elusive. I don\u2019t know what my industry is going to look like on the other side if this. Im rambling at this trying to get out the feelings I have on the matter. It feels pretty hopeless and I maybe want to do something thats not what I have spent 20 years getting good at. I just want to go away somewhere. Anywhere.",
            "I've been working from home for the past 2 years. Well actually, I've been traveling a bit for the past 2 years so I guess working from wherever I'm sleeping for the night or at a cafe #blessedlife. I didn't focus too much on the physical separation thing (separate work and personal space at home) because I'm not really in one place for that long. So instead of relying on my surroundings for the motivation to work, I decided to rely on the work itself. It's easier to start and continue working if you enjoy it, no matter where you physically are. I definitely didn't enjoy my work in the beginning, like, I hated 90% of it. So I had to figure out why I hated what I hated and change it so I'd hate it less (or start liking it), or if possible just not do that part of the job anymore. This helped A LOT. And of course, doing more parts of the job that I already liked :) But the former, MUCH more effective. Good luck y'all and stay healthy.",
            "It's 3 am, and 5 minutes ago I was trying to sleep and I could because I was thinking about this exact thing...",
            "Yeah. Massive insomnia. Stress eating. Difficulty focusing. It\u2019s really hard to focus on work while working at home.\n\n... and it\u2019s very monotonous. I feel like I\u2019m reliving the same day over and over. It\u2019s lonely and depressing.\n\nI know it\u2019s for the greater good but it\u2019s hard and what bugs me is I\u2019m on Teams with the rest of the people I work with and everyone seems perfect and fine! Chipper and happy! I don\u2019t understand why I\u2019m feeling like this...",
            "I feel you bro. I work from home for few months now and i feel tired MOREEE compare when I work in the office. I don't have a suitable work station here at home, usually work on bed or sofa and I feel unproductive after my shift. Hahaha",
            "I could live like this permanently. It's my preferred mode of existence, and I find I'm much more motivated and creative now than when I was motating to the office and seeing dozens of people all day.\n\nIf you find the present state of things problematic, maybe you're the kind of person who derives energy from face-to-face interaction. My boss is like this. Set up a video calling app and make sure you have regular meet-ups with people (but not people like me!) - the face to face stuff might be critical to your well being.",

            "I\u2019ve worked from home for 7-8 years now and I still procrastinate with washing up or playing xbox but now I get up earlier and plough through work and by 10/11am I still have my whole day to procrastinate/play games.\nI think the weather doesn\u2019t help (if you\u2019re in the U.K.) as it\u2019s flipping spring and it\u2019s like summer!! Working from home on a hot day is hard!",
            "no",
            "There are a lot of great work from home tips here, but I also suggest looking into some mental health resources. \n\nEveryday we hear reports about people dying and getting sick, and depending on where you are you might be hearing of your government's incompetence or how \"we're not yet even at the peak of it\" or \"the vaccine is years away\". Even for those of us who are and will be safe and comfortable in our homes in the foreseeable future, this pandemic is taking a huge toll on our mental health: we have to worry about not getting sick and not going outside, we constantly have to worry about our food and medicine and supplies, we don't have as much social contact as we used to, our daily routines (a source of comfort for many) have been completely disrupted, we're not free to go to where we want, and there's a looming threat of recession and hard times or even unemployment for everyone.\n\nThis is a lot for anyone, and I know a lot of people who are experiencing constant, debilitating anxiety *for the first time*. If you've never had it before, you're likely thinking \"oh I'm not productive now because I'm lazy, I have so much free time I should be doing something with my time\" - stop! It's perfectly normal to be less productive when you have anxiety, and it's perfectly normal to have anxiety during this time of crisis. The more you expect of yourself, the worse your anxiety, and it's a vicious cycle to be in. Cut yourself some slack if you're not getting 8 hours of work a day, and take some time to meditate and self care (which isn't just eating ice cream or binging a TV show, as these are forms of self soothing; there are plenty of resources online on the difference).",
            "Set a clear line between \"work\" and home\"; I've heard of this before from people who work from home, and it's usually because you're blending the two together. When you do that, the result is that your brain never really leaves \"work mode\". I have the same problem, with the opposite result - I have a hobby I'm trying to turn into a career, and I often experience that even if I have worked on it that day, any time where I'm *not* working on it, I feel like I should be. I struggle to turn my work brain off.\n\nSet yourself clear \"work hours\", as best you can. Try to use the majority of that time to work. And when you're finished, you are *finished*. You're off the clock. Don't let your boss (if you have one) convince you that you need to be available at all hours just because you're home.  You don't. Do not let your work hours creep into your off hours if you can help it.\n\nAlso if you're able, have *one* specific room that you use as a \"work room\".",
            "It's the daily commute I miss the most. I mean, I fucking hate driving in my city, I get frustrated by idiot drivers and general assholes each time but I miss it. This frustration, and recording videos on my dashcam became my daily routine and I kind of like it because it's something different from relaxing work and home life. I know it's stupid to miss something I hate but I do.",

            "No.",
            "Yes. I\u2019m self employed and often work from home but this is different. \nI had to put in some MAJOR accountability measures in place for  myself. I did some serious goal planning (6 months, 1 year, 2 year and 5 year), with concrete timelines and specific goals. \nI also found an accountability partner. I made certain pledges for daily activities and I have to pay her 20$ each day I don\u2019t do it. She checks in... everyday! \nI\u2019ve definitely learned that the \u201ccarrot\u201d doesn\u2019t motivate me but the \u201cstick\u201d sure as hell does. Lots of day I don\u2019t want to do those activities, but I definitely don\u2019t want to pay her, and I can\u2019t lie about it, so I just fucking have to do it. \nI implemented these changes 2 weeks ago and I\u2019ve been tracking my activities. My productivity is WAY up. Like 300% up from when everything really started going sideways. \n\nI\u2019m happy to chat with anyone about the specifics and help with some planning if you\u2019re interested. Message me. \nHope that helps."

Could you imagine how hopeless life would be if we passed our last opportunity by the time we hit 22? \n\n52 years of helplessness?\n\nNot even this reality is that messed up.\n\nYou have more than two more life-until-nows to do whatever you want.",
            "You\u2019re not old. No offense, but at this age you still don\u2019t really know what life is. I\u2019m 31 and after a lot of effort I am now getting back to school to finish my degree. Go get it bro.",
            "Wow. I'm curious to know why you think life is some type of competition, and from where you have sourced your measuring sticks?\n\nYour question smacks of a huge misunderstanding of the human experience. It sounds almost robotic, friend.\n\nGenerally speaking, nobody is out here, measuring you, and your level, on some cosmic \"success chart\". Seriously. You do you you, boo.\n\nThere is a lot to unpack, regarding \"comfortable\" and \"successful\", in the way you used those terms, but all you should be doing is defining those types of words, as you feel they relate to you, my fellow human. Nobody else can define those things for you.\n\nYou are, literally, too young to even be worried about this. Make others happy, when you can, and you only can, because you are happy with yourself. You're going to be fine.",

            "Oh thank the gods I'm not stuck as the person I was at 22. Yes, you can honestly and truly change your life drastically at 22. You're not even that old for college. I went back at 25 and most people just assumed I was a transfer. College is way less serious than media would have you believe. \n\n\n\n\nAlso, college isn't necessary for a comfortable and successful life. If college doesn't suit you, take up an art or a trade, go to a technical school or get an internship, write or draw or open an only fans or a twitch channel. Do whatever you need to do to make the money you need to survive and pursue your passions. Money can't buy happiness but financial stability goes a long way towards being comfortable.",
            " Bruh, I\u2019m 35, and I\u2019m thinking about going back. \n\nIt\u2019s not too late. I had classmates in college that were in their 60\u2019s. Live your life. \n\nYou got this.",

            "I went back to college at 28! You can do it.",
            "22 is super early. The tip to successfulness is not not give a shit what other people think. Going to college at age 22? Sure that\u2019s awesome that you want to learn new things, fuck people who judge you. I\u2019m doing my PhD, and let me tell you there are literally people in their 40s and 50s doing PhD. It\u2019s never too late to learn things, and just know that for a lot of the people out there like us, we won\u2019t judge you for being older than other same year colleagues, in fact, we\u2019re really surprised and astounded by how brave you are to try things out. You\u2019re not alone in this world, my friend finished college as a bio student, but didn\u2019t like what she studied, so she took two years preparing for the exam and applied for dentist major. She\u2019s now a certified dentist and happily married. I did my bachelor in mechanical engineering, but midway through for some reason I ended up doing PhD in material science, the subject that I failed in my freshman year. You never know where life takes you, and that\u2019s the beautiful part of life. You can steer and aim for what you think you want, but often the stream might redirect you to another path, and that\u2019s ok, just know that each path has its own unique view and worth enjoying.\nMy mentor always said, if a person graduated top tier, got to a great college, Masters, PhD, applied for a great and easy job, made a lot of money, and retired with a wife and kids, he has the worst life possible, because there\u2019s no story to his life. Just know that the more stories you can tell others about your life, the more flavorful your life is. It\u2019s not about success, often times the journey, and sometimes even suffering throughout your life can make great memories in the future.",

            "My comment will just add to everything everyone else is saying, but I wanted to share my story. 22 is not too old for college. I went right after high school but had zero focus after 3 terms. Dropped out, joined the military for a while, found my focus after a few years, and reenrolled after my enlistment was up. Returned to the classroom when I was 24, took my time getting my bachelor's and graduated 5\u00bd years later. Went back for my teaching certification, and entered the education field, where I have been happy for the last 23 years. \n\nJust do it, man!",
            "I don\u2019t know where you from. But my story starts at 22. i entered full adult life. Earning way more money than my then student friends did. And since then I know, you recognize you\u2019re doing well when your old friends do.\nDo WHATEVER you want to do. Don\u2019t give a flying f about your peers and friends. It\u2019s YOUR life.\nAnd believe me: 50% won\u2019t make it career wise. And the rest is old money.\n\nStay the way you are\nStop doubting\n\nAnd the world is yours!\n\nEdit: Sounds bit weird. I started as an intern in a bank and worked my way up. With some bachelor-ish background",
            "I'm 25 and currently attending college finally to get out of the career I dove into when I was 21. It's never too late, because there's nothing to be \"late\" for.",
            "I didn\u2019t go to University until I was 29, and was married with a kid. No one\u2019s life is irreversible at 22, hell no ones life is irreversible at 52!",
            "I completely regret going to university. Was a waste of my time and I only went because I thought I had to go. At 22 you have your whole life ahead of you. You're still a baby adult.\n\nJust make sure you don't waste you years between 20 - 30. It's a looooong journey and victory is not achieved on any single day but is the result of compounded effort in the right direction over many many days. So if you have a bad day don't stress and don't beat yourself up about it. It's a ratio if you have one bad day make sure you relax, regroup, rethink and then follow it up with a good day or 3. Never give up, just circle back and try again. All success is built on the back of repeated failure.\n\nDon't try to achieve too much in a single day, focus on 3 things to accomplish and do them to the best of your ability.\n\nDon't get distracted by nice but irrelevant things - in this day and age with social media exposing us to sights, sounds and ideas we'd never have seen organically it can be easy to suddenly want to be a ski instructor even tho you live in Africa or a bee keeper or whatever. I read this somewhere and it applies - make a list of the top 25 things you want to do or be. Then pick the best 5 focus on them and never think about the other 20 again. You can do this exercise yearly to update and validate the results but the important thing is to limit what you put on your plate.\n\nFocus on your health - develop and understanding of what is healthy and what works for you. Diet, mentality, spirituality and exercise. Do not let a week pass in your 20s where you don't exercise (at least 3 times). Again it's a long journey and the results may seem to never come but trust in your direction, head down move forward. When you enter your 30s you will be primed and amazed at the condition you are compared to your peers - even if It's just happiness without wealth. Also - try not to compare with your peers.\n\nPut money away in a place that will grow. Do this every month. I know it's tempting to spend it, buy the latest toys, go to bars and restaurants but do all of this AFTER you have tucked at least 15% of your income away. A stocks and shares ISA, ETF, Index tracker, pension, company share plan, property, company/business. All are good! Spend after you save not the other way around. Pay day = save day.\n\nDo this and forget about success. When a kid looks on the mirror every day wishing he was taller he never sees the growth. Go away, work hard, choose to be happy and trust that universe will reward you with what you deserve and can handle. Work on seeing the good, the sun on your skin, a cuddle with a loved one. \n\nI hope that in this moment you are not hungry, in pain or in discomfort. Remind yourself of that when you let the troubles of the past or worries for the future creep in a affect your happiness in this moment. Let the past live in the past and let the future stay in the future. It is important to remember and to plan but try to keep the present just for you.\n\nRead the meditations of Marcus Aurelius. Read up about the Stoics. Read Viktor Frankl's Man's search for meaning. Read the subtle art of not giving a fuck. Read Ekhart Tolle's the power of now. Read Tony Robbins - any (I recommend Unshakable). Read  David Goggins Can't hurt me.\n\nAsk who do I want to be. What do I enjoy. Why am I doing this. What am I good at. What is useful/valuable now. What will be useful/valuable in the future.\n\nAbove all happiness is not seeking an finding pleasure. Therein lies hedonism and addiction. Being content is a mindset and a discipline that one can work on. It is the key to saving on your time and resources so that you use these more effectively. If you just wake up and do whatever you want or whatever tickles your desire in the moment without asking 'does this take me closer to what is really important' you might look up and you'll be entering your 30s having devoted a vast amount of your prime years to things that were fun but ultimately grew into nothing. This could be staying in the club till 6am instead of leaving at 1am. It could be trying to fuck a tinder date when you already have someone you would like a serious relationship with. It could be smoking weed first thing in the morning, it could be not having a glass of water between beers - to each his own vices and virtues.\n\nYou are young, life is both longer and shorter then we expect. Relax.",

            "A few things to think about.\n\n1st, if you want to go to college, then look at a junior college or similar.  Costs will be MUCH lower, and you'll be able to knock out at least a 2 year degree, if not more, and it will not leave you with a ton of debt.\n\n2nd, you don't need a degree to go far in life.  Trades need people, and most will give you the on-the-job training needed to succeed.\n\n3rd, theres always the military.  Talk to the recruiters for the Navy or Air Force.  Take some time studying for the ASVAB, and take the dang test.  Even if you don't join, the ASVAB can give you a pretty good idea of where your talents lie.  The way it is categorized and is scored can be very insightful, and if you do join, you'll learn new skills that can get you going in life.",

            "So first of all, ratings are not determined by counting all the TVs watching a show or channel in real time. What happens is that a company (Nielsen is the company that mainly does this) sends out a questionnaire to selected households and pays them to fill out a daily diary of what they are watching and how many. The House sends it in at a set timeline and the company does their extrapolation to figure out approximately how many are watching countrywide. They are very good at selecting a good representative test group and are pretty accurate. These days instead of a diary they send out a box that you hook up to your TV and it records and sends the information independently. \n\nSo while many bars and restaurants have sports playing all the time, Nielsen takes that in to account when making their calculations, so the number we see is still a fairly accurate market share of people watching.",
            "People are only talking about Nielsen ratings here but there are far more reliable measurements now, specifically comScore, which automatically reports viewership if you have Dish, Spectrum, or a number of other services. Sample sizes in mid-size markets are over 200,000 TVs, so the estimates are about as true as data gets. \n\nThat being said, ESPN averages about a 8.5 cumulative rating during the day, which means .8.5% of TVs tune into ESPN on a given day. For a population of 100,000, that would be about 8,500 TVs.\n\nThere are about 470,000 full-service restaurants in the US, let\u2019s say with sports bars having tons of TVs, the average is 1.5 ESPN TVs per restaurant on average, giving us 705,000 ESPN restaurant TVs in the U.S. With 375 million people, that is 1 ESPN restaurant TV per 532 people. In a city of 100,000 that is 188 restaurant TVs.\n\nSo, 188 divided by 8,500 restaurant TVs means restaurants account for approx. two percent of ESPN\u2019s ratings. \n\nEDIT: But on a given program at 5pm, that % would be higher. Those average about a 1 rating, which would mean assuming the above restaurant TVs account for about 18.8% of that comScore rating. \n\nEDIT 2: This does not count the growing number of people streaming, which only ESPN truly knows as that data is proprietary and they don\u2019t need Nielsen or comScore to figure it out. ",
            "Not sure how many of the TV\u2019s in those places aren\u2019t running off a single source. Could be multiple screens sharing the same source.  If this is the case then one restaurant could only be using 1-2 cable/dish boxes for multiple TV\u2019s. ",

            "Not as much as CNN in airports. ",
            "But that\u2019s not actually how they determine viewership. They use neilson boxes and then make estimates based on the stats they get from the boxes.",

            "How much of Fox News viewership if from nursing homes playing it constantly in the background",
            "I will attempt to answer this:  In 2015, according to Forbes, ESPN viewership was 2.15 million.  In 2015, there were just under 65,000 bars.  (And while you could say some bars have several TV's on ESPN, but most of the time the viewership counts cable boxes, so a place like BWW will have a few, where as small bars might not play it at all, lets just say average.) it comes out to about 3%.  So plus or minus three percent if every bar in the country had it on for background noise.  This doesn't really tell us too much though, because background advertisements might still sell, having the TV tuned in allows you to push whatever programming you're having that night, and live advertising is where the real money is at.  So more than likely, advertisers probably have to buy a package that gets them one or several ads during the main event, and a few here and there during background noise times.  ",
            "[Nielsen measures this specifically.](https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/press-room/2018/out-of-home-data-reporting-by-nielsen-just-got-a-lot-quicker.html)  But the answer to how much it ESPN\u2019s viewing is out-of-home is likely a pretty confidential and closely tracked piece of information for their business.

I can\u2019t understand why it seems that the first thing numerous people seem to need to do in the morning (I live in Vancouver BC) is smoke weed. Without fail, every day on my way to work at around 8am, people get off the skytrain and light a joint as they exit the station. I see people outside the building opposite mine (a visual effects company) smoking weed 10 seconds before they go inside to start work. Some of them even cycle to work so I presume it\u2019s not a physical pain reliever for those folks. What did these people do before weed was legalized and they became able to wake and bake as I believe it\u2019s known.\n2. Given the scientific evidence base regarding cannabis use and psychosis in young adults (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(19)30175-0/fulltext) I\u2019m surprised that young people often try to live so healthily around here (yoga, veganism, exercise, hiking, etc) whilst consuming cannabis.\n3. Given the evidence base on the impairment caused by consumption of cannabis (https://www.iii.org/article/background-on-marijuana-and-impaired-driving) I\u2019m also surprised that anyone would consume it and expect to be able to work or perform at their maximum potential. I guess it\u2019s like someone who claims that a couple of shots of brandy steadies the nerves and helps focus\u2026 placebo at best and outright denial at worst.\n4. My next door neighbour used to smoke cigarettes. The smoke smell was instantly identifiable if we were out in the garden. The person who moved in when the previous guy moved out smokes weed - now if we have my 2 year old\u2019s bedroom window open on warm evenings, his whole bedroom smells of cannabis and it drifts throughout our house. I wonder if weed users know or care that we\u2019re all involuntarily smelling their habit.",

That\u2019s all it takes - repetition and reward.  As humans we have plenty of things we repeat with rewards that fall more into the habit category than the addiction category (morning coffee, certain routines) but with mind-altering substances the chemicals they produce in the brain further enhances the pathways and once an element of compulsion is at play *BOOM* it\u2019s extremely difficult to stop.  Personally I think any substance that changes how you feel can be addictive, Lord knows I may have quit drugs and alcohol but I\u2019m still addicted to caffeine and nicotine \n\nI think as far as the weed culture, people with similar interests naturally flock together and the interest kind of grows.

Heavier smokers who made it a daily habit were especially harmed by it to the point where they had problems being functional members of society, keeping a job, causing problems with friendships and relationships.\n\nI view weed like I view alcohol.  Infrequent, casual consumption is not a problem.  When it turns into a way of life, it's just as harmful as alcohol abuse.\n\nAdditionally, people will argue the benefits of it to their lives, and in some ways, medically it can be helpful.  However, many who swear by it merely use it as a crutch against actual life, and it becomes detrimental.  They only think they're better with it, but they aren't.  They never are, not one person.\n\nI don't care what people want to think about it.  It is a drug.  It does affect you.  It can be abused.  And significant quantity and time under the influence will fuck up your life.\n\nAdditionally, legalization requires a need to regulate it in the same way as alcohol.  This includes work place, driving, using heavy machinery, having a license and performing work in a manner that carries risk to or having significant influence over the public, all of this needs to be treated exactly the same as alcohol is treated in all aspects of life.",

It\u2019s an anecdote, not everyone\u2019s experience will be the same as we all are different and thus our experiences will vary. \n\nBut. I smoke nightly, I find it really helps me to sleep. I also find that smoke sometimes in the evening before some tv time can be really relaxing. I have anxiety generally, so it sort of shuts that down, and I can relax.  I don\u2019t need it to relax of course but, it\u2019s an easy thing that I know relaxes me. \n\nI\u2019m not addicted in a physics sense. Even though I smoke nightly, if I need to not for some reason, it\u2019s not a problem. There\u2019s no sense of withdrawal or loss. Traveling for a week? Ok. No smoking. No problem. Went into surgery a few weeks back and chose not to smoke the night or two before hand despite having some anxiety.  No problem. So for me there isn\u2019t a physical addiction where I feel withdrawals or get the shakes or a headache or anything. I just choose not to smoke and it\u2019s fine. \n\nBUT it can very easily be a crutch for me for dealing with my emotions or stress. I currently loathe my job and I\u2019m job hunting. It\u2019s a lot of work on top of a full time job and raising a child. I\u2019m tired. I\u2019m burnt out after the last few years. Smoking is an easy way to shut down all those rapid thoughts and the worry that comes with them. It\u2019s easy to smoke and use it as a way to relax instead of worrying. So, it can be easy to reach for the pipe when shit goes south, or when you have problems to face but you would rather not. That\u2019s where the addiction for me is most evident. Sure I could go deal with my problems and face them head on. Or I could smoke, put my feet up and relax for a bit because I\u2019m beyond emotionally and physically tired. It gives me an easy out. The jokes about couch lock and such are very true. And this is where stoners need to check themselves. \n\nPs for stoners always talking about it, that\u2019s really just the vocal minority, at least where I am (it\u2019s legal).

She was getting to a point where she would take a few vape hits every few hours (works from home) but her tolerance skyrocketed so she has learned how to better manage her stress and keeps it to a few hits after work. She smokes like an 8th every two weeks worth of weed, it's not a lot but it's helped her in a lot of ways. I would rather she smoke some weed at night than be on antidepressants or start taking xanax all day long.\n\n\nBut its not a miracle drug. She can get real complacent and lazy if she is hitting it hard and she struggles pretty bad if she tries to take a break for a week or two to get her tolerance down.

It's a slippery slope, some people will look at this post and say \"See?? It's not harmless and she has withdrawals, so it's addictive!\" Others will see it as a medicine, which it very well can be if not abused.

I wake up happy, refreshed mentally, no more post alcohol anxiety and depression, I feel way healthier and I\u2019m in the best shape I\u2019ve ever been in. \n\nThat said - cannabis reacts differently with everyone.

It's defined by continuing use in the face of negative consequences.  This is known as \"problematic use.\"\n\n\"Problematic use\" is defined, unsurprisingly, by the problems it causes.  If you're able to use and it doesn't cause any problems in your life, no matter how much or how often you use, you don't exhibit problematic use and as a consequence would not be diagnosable with a Substance Use Disorder.\n\nThis is, of course, confounded by people who don't realize or are in denial of the problems their use is causing...which is why professional Substance Use Disorder Assessors are a thing...their assessment will help to tease apart what is actually a problem in your life.\n\n\"Addictive\" in its colloquial meaning of \"thing I want to do a lot\" isn't an especially helpful measure, in particular with things like process addictions like video games or self-harm or whatever.  You only want to play Halo 2 to the exclusion of all other leisure activities?  Okay, what problems is that causing in your life?  If your answer isn't pretty specific and serious you're unlikely to actually be describing an addiction.  \n\n\n(edited: I word good!)",

It was made illegal in the first place in the 1920s by rich businessmen invested in lumber who didn\u2019t want to see hemp replace it as a commodity in things like paper.
