            "Originally the body positivity movement was mostly for the anatomical differences not relating to weight: face deformities, amputees, scars, stretch marks etc. But then the movement expanded to things such as height and weight as we became more open-minded as a community. Regarding overweight people, it was sort of highjacked, whether you were overweight or underweight it was about accepting who you are, as an individual not as a collective to help with body dysmorphia and that just because your body isn\u2019t model-material you are still worth it. That isn\u2019t to say they are healthy or unhealthy, it\u2019s just about being comfortable. It wasn\u2019t about promoting \u201cthis is what everyone should look like\u201d which is what you\u2019re referring to via \u201cobesity is healthy\u201d it is about saying I like how I look, that\u2019s it. Just a small minority has taken the movement too far.",
            "I think there is room for it to not be about hating your body, but also not giving up. A fat person can still have value and shouldn't be subject to abuse because of how they look without normalising obesity or pretending that their choices aren't unhealthy.",
            "Because there are about 85 times as many overweight people in the US as there are amputees, so while body positivity movements certainly include amputees and scarred people, the numbers just aren't there to make a large movement.",
            "It\u2019s not about being overweight being ok, it\u2019s about not shattering people\u2019s self esteem or mental health. Just don\u2019t be a prick to people. It\u2019s really not hard. \n\nI\u2019m an overweight (possibly obese depending on who you ask) man (31) who\u2019s been struggling to try and lose weight for a while now. I hate myself purely because of the way I look. I know I\u2019m not the healthiest person but having people constantly tell me I\u2019m going to die early, constantly comment on the way I look has been, frankly, devastating for my self esteem. I feel extremely uncomfortable receiving any complements from my partner because I have been conditioned my whole life to feel like I can\u2019t possible look good or even acceptable because of my weight. \n\nIt\u2019s not even like you\u2019re encouraging people to get fit and healthy. My motivation for my weight loss swings wildly depending on how I feel. The negativity doesn\u2019t encourage me, it just makes me feel like \u201cwhat\u2019s the point?\u201d.\n\nSorry for the rant, just wanted to offer some perspective from the other side of the argument.",
            "It still encompasses the disfigured and the disabled. But nobody deserves to be treated differently because of their appearance. \nAnd I know it seems focused on obese people, but there are just so many more obese people than there are in the other groups hat movement is focused on. Plus lots of people with other issues become obese as well so it kinda makes sense. \nObese people didn't force out the original people intended to benefit from the movement, they just wanted to be added to it. \nMaybe not everyone is visually beautiful to the average person, but everyone at least deserves to not be treated as a social outcast.",
            "I think because fat people are seen as \"gross and disgusting\"   by the majority of society. People with different abilities are discriminated against but still have sympathy from society. Like only truly horrible people would make fun of someone with a different level of ability, but every sitcom has a dumb, lazy fat person who is the butt of every joke.",
            "I don't agree that body positivity is focused on proving obesity is healthy. It's about teaching people to love themselves and teaching others that stigmatising people for their appearance only makes the problem worse. \n\nI was overweight for most of my life. Stigma, shame, and fat shaming just made me stuff my face even more because I accepted it's just who I was, and that I could never be anything else other than a fat fuck. Accepting that I loved myself regardless of my weight is what led me down the path to ultimately lose 80 pounds, because suddenly it became about MY happiness, not appeasing others.",
            "Look. I\u2019m fat. I don\u2019t need sympathy. I also don\u2019t need to be reminded I\u2019m fat daily. I\u2019m in highschool. They don\u2019t gotta be doing these fat is healthy things. I know it\u2019s not. I\u2019ve lost 50lbs already and more on the way. But I believe the reason this movement exists is because fat people are constantly reminded they are fat. Several times a day one of my friends will come up and flick my man boob. I\u2019m not offended at all by it, obviously I\u2019m fat, it\u2019s annoying that I\u2019m constantly reminded of it like I don\u2019t know myself. Everyone has there own problems, you don\u2019t go up to an amputee and say u have no limb, and no one does that. You don\u2019t go up to a fat guy and make a joke or something like that, but people do that. It\u2019s unnecessary. We\u2019re all people and have problems. My point is why point out one\u2019s problems when you have your own? Doesn\u2019t help anything but spread negativity",
            "The point of body positivity isn't to say \"Obesity is healthy!\"\n\nIt's that you shouldn't feel like shit for being above a certain BMI. Especially taking into account that there are different body shapes, different metabolisms, and our standards have been artificially warped by Hollywood.\n\nAgain, it's not \"Obesity is healthy!\"  It's \"my happiness and self-worth shouldn't be fixated on this one thing, especially if I am taking steps to make good choices.\"\n\nRemember, it can be a lot of work to lose weight! I've been a 320 pound man eating 1800 calories a day and making an effort to go on a long walk each day, but that's not going to turn me into an Adonis anytime soon.  Should I just feel like shit until I melt down to 150?",
            "This question comes up surprisingly often on Reddit and the root of it is ultimately a fundamental misunderstanding of what the body positivity movement is. It's not just a way of patting people on the back and saying \"it's fine that you're fat!\" in the same way that you might say \"it's fine that you're an amputee!\" or \"it's fine that you have a scar!\" It's a movement with tangible goals that seek to address tangible problems that are specific to the fat community. I hate to be the \"just read this article!!\" guy but I really cannot explain any of this better than Michael Hobbes' extremely well-written and well-sourced article: https://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/everything-you-know-about-obesity-is-wrong/",
            "Body positive isn't supposed to infer anything about health.\n\nIt's just supposed to help people feel comfortable in their own skin and dissuade people from ridiculing others for their appearance.\n\nIt's not meant to say that obesity is healthy, normal, encouraged or anything like that. Just don't be a dick to someone because they're obese.",
            "I run a weight loss support group and let me tell you - no overweight or obese person I know loves the way they look. People like me really struggle with weight loss and try to be as healthy as we can be. But sometimes medical conditions make it harder to lose the weight - and it takes longer than people without certain medical conditions. Hormones, thyroid issues and insulin resistance are all examples of conditions can impact a person who is trying to lose the weight.\n\nI don't agree with promoting obesity as healthy because obviously in ~~some~~ *most* cases, it's not healthy. But as someone who was bullied as a teen for my weight - I can tell you that body shaming can do a lot of long-term damage and can completely destroy someone's confidence.\n\nEDIT:  people who are overweight can absolutely be healthy - as in not having any medical conditions that impact their overall health. I know some people who carry a little extra weight and run marathons. This comment sparked a long discussion. \n\nI've known thin people who are incredibly unhealthy and I've known people who are slightly overweight (15-20 pounds) and have zero health issues.",

I'm on a steady pace of losing weight, but it'll still be a long time before I'm the weight I'm aiming for.\n\nI need to not hate myself in the meantime. I tried before to lose the weight, I was ridiculed and mocked at the community center I was at for my size. I went back to self loathing and gave up. I gained about 30 pounds during the months after that.\n\nI never at any point thought I was healthy, but being insulted and hating myself for being fat doesn't work.

            "I think that the body posi movement has included the people you\u2019ve mentioned. I\u2019ve seen some body positive accounts on Instagram include women with severe stretch marks or pregnancy scars. I\u2019ve also seen amputees, burn victims, etc. There\u2019s also woman who society has deemed \u201ctoo manly\u201d that are mentioned a great deal (Serena Williams for example). I don\u2019t think body positivity focuses solely on heavier people, I think it focuses on normalizing that we are all different and not everyone looks like what we are force fed every day. When I was in high school(2011-2015) my first two years thigh gaps were IT!!! Seriously I was obsessed with getting a thigh gap and ED tumblr was rampant. By the time I was a junior, \u201cthick thighs save lives\u201d and getting a big butt was in. I had neither. As you can imagine it was extremely confusing that I was told my thighs couldn\u2019t touch then being told yes big thighs and a thick booty is what you need. Body positivity is for everyone to celebrate their \u201cmeat suit\u201d because essentially that\u2019s what our bodies are. Perhaps bigger people are featured more because they are more common, hell, most people are not a size 2 (I could be wrong I don\u2019t want to offend anyone who is or knows an amputee or other disabled individuals). Don\u2019t be afraid to join the movement if you feel you aren\u2019t being represented enough!!!! After all the point is to be accepting of every single type of person. If you do feel you want to fill in some gaps you\u2019ve noticed I would refrain from using the language from your post. It\u2019s not about \u201cfat people trying to prove that obesity is healthy\u201d it\u2019s about taking the focus away from the physical part of us. Fat people go to the doctor and conditions are often ignored because the doctor will just prescribe them to \u201close weight and you\u2019ll be better\u201d. There\u2019s also a plethora of health conditions that can lead to extreme weight gain. Not to mention the economic factors (look up food deserts). You never really know someone\u2019s story!!! So instead of focusing on \u201cwhy that rather than this\u201d, enter the community with the mindset \u201cwhy not everyone\u201d. It\u2019s not about proving any shape is healthy it\u2019s about telling people to worry about their own health/body and to refrain from telling others their body is wrong, gross, unhealthy, etc.",
            "This shit again lol",
            "For what it\u2019s worth, I do see a lot of body positivity focused on scars, amputations, and other permanent things in the areas that I tread online.  I think it\u2019s often framed differently and not everyone posting about \u201cbody positivity\u201d uses that exact phrase in said post, yknow?\n\nTo address your second point, when it comes to fat acceptance/positivity, it\u2019s not about pretending that being fatter is healthier, it\u2019s about the tremendous pressure our culture puts on people to lose weight before they can feel good about themselves in any capacity.  Compared to every other \u201cunhealthy habit,\u201d being fat is demonized quite disproportionately.  It\u2019s not about the health, it\u2019s about how cruel we are to fat people over what is framed as \u201chealth concerns,\u201d but really amounts to discomfort with looking at fat bodies.\n\nThird, losing weight isn\u2019t as easy or safe as you might think.  The vast majority of people who lose a sizable amount of weight gain it back shortly thereafter, often even more.  I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s impossible to keep it off, but it\u2019s uncommon enough that I find it really concerning how often we recommend that to people.  Any other medical treatment that had a 90% chance of just making the problem worse 5 years later and adding tremendous mental stresses to your life either way would be considered laughably ineffective.\n\nSo, what do you do as a fat person? Permanently damage any positive associations you might have with food and likely put yourself in a cycle of yo-yo diets? Or accept that your current weight might not be as healthy as other people in your life, but live your life happily and with love toward yourself?",

            "The body positivity movement is about all those things, but the focus tends to be on plus sized people because they\u2019re the ones who are looked at as having something wrong that needs to be fixed.

(I\u2019m not saying there aren\u2019t ignorant people who say stuff like that about others, of course there are, but it\u2019s not as accepted as the norm if that makes sense). And while fat people are in the forefront of the movement it\u2019s just because they\u2019re the ones you see standing up most for it. The movement itself though is about body types, disabilities, scars, marks, and everything else, you\u2019re likely just not looking for it in the right places",
            "That's a very disingenuous phrasing for that question. \n\nBody positivity has very little to do with health and more to do with accepting people for the way they look and not being shitty and hateful towards others and ourselves. People with scars and missing limbs don't often get as much hate for being the way they are and don't often get this nasty attitude and false concerns about their looks so you hear more about them in the positivity movements but everyone is included and nobody should have to feel like shit for looking the way they look.\n\nI've heard plenty of women in particular being called a fat bitch or something but not once heard anyone get called a legless whatever or scarred anything. The focus goes where there's greater need just like with anything.",

I don\u2019t think an amputee would feel attacked if there was literally a way to grow their arm back and you suggested they do it they\u2019d be like fuck yeah but fat people are just super sensitive about it. \n\nSource: former fat person.",

That being said, I do agree that there should be more focus on body positivity for the groups of people you spoke of. I think being overweight has taken over the body positivity movement more because it\u2019s stigmatized more. The fact that you point out obesity to be a choice points to that. While of course we should support amputees and those with physical deformities, we also should not judge people for their weight or assume what\u2019s best for them.

But that shit just doesn't sell, does it?",
            "Your question demonstrates exactly why body size is the focus of body positivity. It is still somehow socially acceptable to harass or degrade someone for being \"too fat\" or \"too thin\" , and it's also commonly assumed that people can have control over their body size.\n\nThe fact is, fat doesn't equal sick, and thin doesn't equal healthy. The things that people associate with fatness such as heart disease and organ weakening actually come from the weight cycling people commonly do. Anorexic people often have heart attacks because the starvation weakens the heart muscle. Oddly, the advice usually given to a fat person as \"healthy\" advice is considered dangerously disordered behaviour in someone not fat.\n\nAlso, some conditions that are associated with fatness are not caused by being fat, but are the cause of the weight gain. Type 2 diabetes causes the body to gain fat, but some people still remain thin because the fat builds up around their internal organs instead of around the waist and hips. The internal fat buildup is much more dangerous as it weakens the heart, liver, etc., and doctors also assume that a thin person never needs to be screened for diabetes. As a result, I know several thin people who were ignored over a couple of years of complaining to their doctors of diabetes symptoms, and they ended up going into comas or having heart attacks before anyone discovered their diabetes. I also know lots of people who had cancer, narcolepsy, and other serious health conditions who were not diagnosed for years because doctors told them all their problems were due to their being fat.

Added to the fact that it's harder for women to lose weight compared to men. \n\nAnd all of these things are not the same or completely true for all women. \n\nI'm kinda tired of the whole body positive movement.

The cause is noble but let the Democrats at it and they will invariably fuck things up. Fat ugly women think they have a right to be that fat then they get heart disease at 34 and wonder why no one is there. \n\nRepublicans are not a hell of a lot better.

This can actually cause more problems, like that scene in Friends where Joey learns how to use a thesaurus, and uses a bunch of words which, by technical definition, might seem like they're being used properly\n\nbut are being used completely incorrectly.\n\nI'm seeing it through these comments even, with people saying \"Wow, I had no idea a word meant that!\" but... it doesn't really mean that, in the way they think (or they're missing alternate definitions, or whatever).\n\nIMO, as I said at the top looking up a definition in a dictionary can absolutely have some practical uses, but it's important not to *only* rely on a dictionary definition-- a better, or at least equally useful way of figuring out what a word means is to just *see it used* in various contexts.\n\nThis usually means just doing lots of reading, but there can be other ways too, like immersing yourself in discussions about things that use a lot of jargon or specific terminology.\n\ntl;dr don't become overly reliant on a dictionary, because while it may provide solid technical accuracy, a lot of times it's not a good resource for practical usage",

Making it seem like you're making the appointment for someone else takes the pressure off of you (they won't recognise your voice when you turn up becase A- you'll be talking very little and B- they deal with too many people daily to remember your voice that well).

Its my head!), gossips and derides me to everybody that would tolerate it, and once she mocked me in front of the entire saloon and they all laughed at me because of the way I was checking on my hairdo. She is ableist and made me feel like garbage for years until I told her exactly why she's not my choice person. (She felt betrayed and heartbroken and that's exactly what I was trying to protect her from in the first place but she's good at nagging. )",

When I did mine at a salon that doubled as a school, the people seemed aware that I didn't want to talk (and were trying to do a good enough job to get promoted).\n\nThe cheaper ones like Walmart don't seem to have that training; they're bored and get too prying.",
            "I prefer no talk or real talk. If it\u2019s small talk, small talk, small talk - I\u2019ll bum them out on purpose and scuttle the convo. I\u2019m usually coming in after a 12-hour day, and my capacity for small talk has been Shang Tsunged out of me at that point",
            "Definitely. I'm not sure why exactly. I'm not particularly averse to small talk. Maybe it's the proximity. I like my personal space. I always put off getting a haircut. Jokes on you 2020! Thanks to corona virus, I now own a pair of nice clippers and I've been practicing.",

Family  knew each other so it was actually nice to talk. Then when I switched to my SO's hairdresser (turns out she's an amazing barberess) we talk because she's family friends with my SO.

One reason I don\u2019t like a lot of talking is because usually I cant hear what the fuck they\u2019re saying since there\u2019s really loud clippers right next to my ear.

            "Story time! So, I really hate haircut small talk. I've spent the last few years trying to find a place to get my hair cut that doesn't fuck it up. I keep getting stuck with the new guy at different barbershops and they keep fucking thing up. I finally found a guy that had been doing it a while and did a really good job. He was way too chatty but it was nice to gety hair cut and it not be gapped up and lopsided. After a few times of going to this guy he got a little too comfortable and started bringing out his crazy political shit. On the last time I went it was him and a younger woman working. She was right behind us, maybe 10 feet away. She was really cute and we can both see her in the mirror, facing away from us. He felt the need to talk about how great her ass was, fucking loudly. She and the guy that she's working on can obviously hear him but she didn't flinch. I assume he spends all day doing this. I've just accepted that I'll be getting shitty haircuts somewhere else from now on.\n\nOn a similar note, I can't find a massage therapist that knows how to shut the fuck up. It's the only thing worse than a chatty barber.",

            "I prefer to cut my hair for the cost savings. I go in for special occasions and feel like the talking thing is bs. It\u2019s a service and I\u2019m not paying for the conversation\n\nEdit: my tip should help cover any post-haircut therapy",

The downside of this habit is usually my hairdresser talks a lot about themselves and share their personal info like where they are from, where they live, their children's school, it just goes on. It's okay for me since I love to listen to people talk, but I believe people need to limit information they share with strangers. Whenever it happens, I try to get back to hair-related conversation.

            "This happens A LOT because of the distance from the subject and the other specifics affecting the outcome of the picture. Basically certain lenses, light conditions, and angle/distance from the camera can make your face look shallower, and others deeper, others longer, etc.  [Here is a pretty great example, sums it up better than words.](http://www.danvojtech.cz/blog/wp-content/uploads/cover25-1200x400.jpg)\n\nI've worked in the fashion industry (on the production side) and for photoshoots the model is pretty much the least of our concerns, as lights, the equipment, the weather, EVERYTHING influences how pretty a person will look. If the photographer or the equipment is shit, there's no way in hell the pic will look good without a bunch of digital editing.\n\nWhich brings me to my final point... don't ever ever compare yourself to models/celebrities on social media. Just because people use social media like Instagram on their phones, it doesn't mean those pretty selfies were taken with a phone camera. Pretty much every single pic posted by celebrities/models is run through their personal digital editors or photography agencies, to ensure that simple Sunday lunch pic looks good enough to be a Vogue cover.\n\nEDIT: thanks for the awards! I stand corrected on the lens comment I made, by many professionals that provided insight on the subject. Please don't downvote them, I was incorrect about the lenses. Added more info on other things that I know can distort pic results.

            "There are a lotta variables with photos/videos that don't tend to exist with mirrors. \n\nFor starters, we mostly see ourself in bathroom mirrors, which are usually huge, well lit, and a good distance away from our face; photos/videos can be heavily affected by distance, lighting, and angle. This is why nobody can just pick up a camera and shoot like a professional.\n\n# Distance\n\nDistance is VERY important to photographers. It highlights the figure, but also keeps focus on the area too. Ideally you will see pro photos shot from afar, [because putting the camera too close will distort the facial features](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/biRh5OQNj2-dYMit2cXcPAJlu3Zv0p_LKQmdlOzLjTVJSu3BnAg20ARfM9jgdiYM5twGnVeyHWtc98nTcGZcqRdsxtgYIaRLcPskfII_4koTBPPpokwN1SHTYUsG0COFSX085Pc)(the link is about different lenses, but the affected is the same), even arms length can cause issues. That's why you'll see models photographed in big rooms with the photographer at least 3 feet away from them, and a ton of light sources. Speaking of which...\n\n# Lighting\n\nLighting can accentuate and suppress certain facial features, but it can also depict emotion. [Even emotionless faces will be affected by lighting, it's just how instincts perceive them.](https://s23527.pcdn.co/files/images/portrait_cheat_sheet_yossi.jpg). Up is shone from below, which gives a feeling of dominance, down is shone from above, giving a feeling of submission, and neutral lighting is right in the center, giving a feeling trustworthiness. The most accurate depiction of your face is the one with full lighting, but the world doesn't give us the luxury of light source shining on our face throughout the day. \n\n# Angle\nAngle can be used to addition to lighting, to accentuate and suppress features. A person with a weak chin may look down, a person with short stature may shoot from below, a person with a sharp jawline may turn their head slightly to show it off, etc. Photography is all about making the person look good, so there are a ton of tricks they incorporate. Angle is also linked with emotion: Down facing heads are more threatening, upward facing heads are more pretentious, and neutral facing heads are approachable, and usually accompanied with a smile.\n\nVideo is closer to accuracy than photo, but even that can be affected by the top three.\n\nThe truest depiction of your self is with full lighting, a camera positioned to show the upper portion of your body, and moving your head around.",

We are especially critical when we see a photo someone else took, whether or not it was planned... occassionally I think I look okay in photos but it's rare. Even if you take a selfie, you're still looking at yourself using the camera's discretion.

            "A comment a wrote a few years ago:\n\n* You usually see yourself **every** morning in the mirror with the same light and same shadows. Your brain gets used to this look, since seeing yourself in other lighting circumstances doesn't happen so often. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/WDP2ADs.gif) you see how different a face looks with *only* changing the position of a light source. Intesity, diffusion, hue, size and distance from a light source affect the look substantially aswell.\n\n* The image in the mirror is reversed horizontally so all of your facial irregularities which you are used to, are on the *wrong* side if you look at photos which aren't reversed and make you think you look weird.\n\n* When you see yourself in the mirror, you see a 3D image with your depth perception. On the other hand a photo is usually two dimensional and flat.\n\n* When looking in the mirror you are always seeing yourself with the fixed focal length and field of view of your eyes at the same distance every day. Camera lenses though have various focal lengths, they affect the perspective distortions of your face dependend on the distance between you and the camera as seen in [this example](http://i.imgur.com/zd9VeZU.png).\n\n* In the mirror you're almost always visible front side only. On photos there's always a slightly different vertical and horizontal angle of point of view which you are not used to see in the mirror.\n\nAll these together create the effect of seeing a strange self in photos. It helps a lot to get more self-conscious about your look in photos, if you imagine that all the people that see you in real life and in photos, pretty much perceive you the same way as you perceive yourself when looking in the mirror - they got used to your look exactly how you got used to your look in the mirror. If they'd see a mirrored picture of you, it probably would look unusual to them.\n\nSo don't worry, you look great!",

            "No you are not.

However, as soon as another player attempts a challenge for the ball the play would be stopped for 'dangerous play', and an indirect free kick would be awarded. Most refs would stop play immediately if it became clear the act was intentional, as the law forbids any unspecified conduct that brings the game into disrepute. \n\nDangerous play is defined by law 12 as: \n\n'any action that, while trying to play the ball, threatens injury to someone (including the player themself) and includes preventing a nearby opponent from playing the ball for fear of injury.'\n\nSo tucking the ball away in your hair leaves opponents no other choice but to kick at your head to try and win the ball, which creates a danger to yourself. This is also why we prevent youth players from playing the ball when they are on the ground near opponents; it's not a foul to play the ball on the ground as some people mistakenly think, but it is a foul to create a dangerous situation for yourself by falling onto the ball or playing it while you're not on your feet.",

            "No. Not at all.\n\nEvery sport has what is essentially a \"spirit of the game\" rule, where if something is technically legal, but not in the rulebook, you would eventually have a rule written to amend that.\n\nThis was most notoriously done in the '60s in the sport of hockey. His name was Roger Nielson and he's the only person never to play the game that is in the hockey Hall of Fame, and he was a coach that broke minor league hockey's rulebooks three separate times.\n\nFirst he figured out that no matter how many penalties are called, you can't have less than 3 players on the ice. So he would put on too many men on the ice every ten seconds so the opponent had no chance to score and equalize the game. They made a rule because of him that a penalty shot was awarded for an illegal substitution like his.\n\nSecond, when they started awarding penalty shots, he got the idea to substitute a defenseman in place of the goaltender, and because the defenseman had a longer stick, he would just charge and steal the puck away. So they made a rule you had to put a goaltender in and the goaltender had to stay in the crease until the person taking the penalty shot has touched the puck.\n\nThird, he got the idea that if you pulled the goaltender, he would get an idea to have the goal blocked by placing a stick or equipment or a pile of snow or something that would interfere with the puck, and that led to a rule awarding a goal if the puck was likely to go into the net but was interfered with a foreign object.\n\nIf you don't like hockey, then how about the fact that the basketball shot clock was made because players would build up a lead and just pass the ball keeping people from shooting the ball?  Literally one b-ball game ended 19-18 because the team in the lead just figured out all they had to do was play keep away with the ball, that's why the shot clock was invented in the '50s.\n\nIn this case, if someone were to try that and there wasn't a rule that you couldn't do that, they would make some sort of entrapment rule. It's the same reason why you can't put a soccer ball up up into your armpit and charge at the goal. There's probably an entrapment or retention rule that would apply here.",

My explanation to a referee assessor would be:\n\nPlay was stopped and a caution issued for unsporting behaviour due to a lack of respect of the game. The offending player has committed undue interference to impede his opponents from playing the ball.\n\nThere is a glossary in the LotG and using those words and definitions referees make decisions based on the fair play and the spirit of the game."

Rather, everything has its own clock, and objects in the same frame of reference have clocks that are so similar that it *looks like* simultaneity exists. \n\nSo from our perspective, the light showed up for the telescopes at a particular local time, and that time was as close to 'now' as we can ever get for that black hole.   We can infer that it has locally experienced an additional 50 million elapsed years, but we can never, ever prove it.  We can only ever see the photons as they arrive, so effectively that's the present from our perspective.",
            "To be pedantic, not light but radio waves. The image was created by radio telescopes and then converted into the visible image you see. But yes, it took the radio waves 50 million years to get here.\n\nIf you want to blow your mind a little more, consider that the entire universe that we can see from Earth is a sphere with a radius in light years equal to the age of the universe - about 14 billion years. So could there be something out there beyond 14 billion light years away? Maybe. We just can't see it because the light hasn't gotten here yet.",

            "Yes you are right and let me add some stuff.\n\nThere was a man who said, hey maybe there are points in space that are infinitely massive and dense.At a time where some still believe the sped of light was infinite. That man was Karl Scwarzschild, in 1916. \n\nIn 1958, before a man was even in space, someone said it is a region where nothing at all can escape, not even light, this opened the door for many people to theorize and come up with new possibilities and even change how we see our universe. \n\n3 days ago, black holes weren\u2019t necessarily even canon in real life. Today, we have finally observed one, confirming theory by some of the greatest minds of our human race. \n\nFun fact about the picture. Some of the \u201clight\u201d you see is BEHIND the \u201cevent horizon\u201d. The event horizon is the final destination, you cross that barrier you\u2019ll never escape. How is it behind the black hole? The gravitational pull is so strong that it is taking the light and slinging it around from the back and sending it in our direction. Think of someone spinning a rock on a string, as it is swinging the rock breaks off the string and hits you in the face. Think of the string as gravity, the length of the string as the Scwarzschild radius (the distance from the singularity to the edge of the event horizon) the rock as the light and the earth being you gave. \n\nAlso, something else that\u2019s fun. Not only is this insanely, unfathomably hard to achieve it proves how fast humans can fucking move. Not in actually space but on an intelligence timeline. These people, and don\u2019t forget me and you are included, believe it or not we all contribute just some more than others. 2500 years ago we found out the earth is actually a sphere. 900 years later, in the 4th century, we discovered the earth is actually orbiting the sun, not the other way around. A few hundred years later, Newton explained gravity, and taught us why and how the earth orbits the sun. Lets fast forward to the early 20th century, but don\u2019t forget the huge discoveries in between. The early 20th man finds out how to fly through the skies on earth, overcoming gravity. 1961 comes along, Yuri Gagarin is the first man to leave earths atmosphere, putting down a stepping stone for so many more discoveries. 1969, a man leaves earths atmosphere, and lands on another celestial body, the moon. Today. Man takes a picture of something they weren\u2019t  even certain was real, a black hole. \n\nOne thing you should realize when reading this is how big the magnitude of these discoveries are and the time between them get shorter.\n\n50 years ago we land on the moon. 50 years later, we take picture of something 53 billion light years away. I mean, just imagine where we will be and what we will learn in another 50 years.",

            "I was under the impression that the picture of the black hole was simply a rendering of radio waves with color added for contrast. The light we think we are looking at are just radio waves escaping the black hole. I might be wrong though. It's happened before.",

            "is it possible that the emitted radiation is even older than that? What i mean is, as gravity increases, speed of time slows relative to that object right? So theoretically the energy particles (be it photons or radio waves) are being emitted at the event horizon of this black hole, where the gravity is massive, so theoretically the gravity on that particle causes that particle to experience time slower, so theoretically, the distance can be closer(farther? I'm confused) because of distortion from the gravitational pull, or are they accounting for that?",

            "Indeed.  What you're on the right track, although, the black hole was not transmitted light.  However, the whole galaxy and trillions of stars that you see a portion of at night are all a different spectrum of time.  So when you look up at the universe of stars at night, you see a spectrum of time based on the distance of each star.  And you think back.   Back to any time of your life.  Back to when your parents or grandparents or forefathers were alive.  Back to any time in history that means something to you.  At least one star represents light emitted at an given moment in history of that time that you are thinking about. Tonight you will see the stars as they really are.",

            "Adding to this, is it possible that one of these far flung galaxies currently hosts intelligent life and looks through their telescopes at our galaxy to see how it was hundreds of millions or even billions of years ago? Meaning we just can\u2019t see them yet?",

Were the photons created in mid journey 5,000 years ago and not actually emanating from from the object they appear to be coming from?

            "Yes, the light we see in the photo was emmitted by the ring of gas around the black hole 55 million years ago. Light travels at about 300 million metres per second, so anything you see is technically in the past. For example, light takes about one second to travel from the moon to Earth, and light from the sun takes around eight minutes to get here.",
