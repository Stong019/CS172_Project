            "Mr. Biden knows D.C.'s proverbs. Here are two:\n\n\"If you want a friend in Washington, get a dog.\" - Pres. H.S.Truman\n\n\"I could walk across the Potomac River. The next day they'll say I can't swim.\" - Pres. L.B. Johnson",
            "Don\u2019t listen to politicians, watch what legislation they sign.",
            "Its interesting, no one in the upper echelon of American politics seem to have an extreme view of Joe one way or the other; he is looked at with clear ambivalence. He has been in the Washington for so long that everyone knows him, what he is about, and how he works. He can shake hands with McConnell or Pelosi and it wouldn't be one bit out of character, and compared specifically to Trump, this is a bit jarring. Obviously he has very real issues, such as age and cognition, failure to accomplish his most important wants, and whatever the fuck his son is doing, but ultimately its mostly a voter/other-side thing that he is largely disliked. Its clear his peers accept him, and that counts for a lot, in fact, he makes the very few folks who do NOT like him seem like absolute lunatics (like MTG).\n\nI think its that we are conditioned to be radical at this point. Its been almost 8 years since Trump in 2016, surely 8 since we first started seeing Trump on the political stage, and Biden kinda shuts down radicalism by being so ambivalent. Radicalism works best when the opponent will react radically too, so when you KNOW one side is going to act methodically, bureaucratically, and at times painstakingly bi-partisanly, then radicalism is just pointless. He's an average president, maybe very center in the grand scheme of things, but we are just used to crazy and media is so strong at demonizing, that seeing the reality that he's boring, well liked, and doing as much as he realistically can without moving the needle is a bit off expectation.",
            "If you're pretty conservative and found nothing wrong with what he said, then that tells me you don't involve yourself in the conservative media bubbles.  Joe is a pretty moderate president, and Republicans should be thrilled it's him and not Bernie Sanders or something.",
            "Well he is a conservative democrat, who likes to have a broad appeal, so I'm not surprised that you liked his speech. Heck I'm way to the left of Joe Biden, and I gotta give it to him it was a good speech, definitely the best of his presidency so far. The main thing is that we're gonna have to wait and see if he follows through on his promises.",
            "Anywhere else in the 'western' world, Biden would be a boring centrist\n\nIt's only in the USA where he's a Marxist who rules on the throne of Hell",
            "Joe Biden was picked by the Democrats because he was boring and anything but scary. \n\nRepublicans NEED fear, so they  talk him up as a socialist/Marxist who has immense power to ruin the economy and they talk him down as a puppet and senile unable to do the basics of his job.",
            "Woah you\u2019re a conservative that doesn\u2019t hate Joe Biden with every fiber of your being, thinking Joe is a fraud President and that the election was stolen?! Get ready to be kicked out of \u201cyour side\u201d. \n\nI personally find Joe to be \u201cmeh\u201d. But given the last 4 years of \u201cthe room is on fire\u201d, \u201cmeh\u201d is actually pretty welcoming.",
            "Well it depends on your views. Some people are just so biased they can't really see past the fact he's a Democrat. Some can be okay with what he says. Some are still mad Trump lost. The fact of the matter is, you can't please everyone. Especially in politics.",
            "The Joe Biden you see in conservative media is a caricature.  Conservative media has spent decades building up every Democrat to be some archetype they have to fight against, and this bias has leaked to purported neutral media as well because its what sells and makes the most money.\n\nLook at job growth under Democratic administrations vs. Republican ones.  Democrats create way more jobs.\n\nDeficit reduction?  Democrats lower them while Republicans spend like crazy.\n\nGDP, quality of life, protection for civil rights, social security, social safety nets, etc. all are better under Democratic leadership than Republican ones.\n\nSure, one or two stats might be misleading.  Three or four and you start to get suspicious that conservatives are lying to you.  But pretty much everything positive comes under Democrats vs. Republicans?  I don't have to spell it out for you, you know that its unlikely all of this happens by chance.\n\nIf you want help as a conservative dude, if you think taxes are too high for you and not high enough for billionaires, if you think that you deserve to have the right not to be eating tainted food from unregulated factories, if you want local government to work for you rather than sell off public stuff to corporations, if you want you and your kids healthy and able to breathe clean air and drink clean water, then vote Democrat.  \n\nThe GOP leadership had to make a deal with a pedophile like Matt Gaetz to finally get the Speakership after 15 rounds of voting, do you really think they have your best interests at heart?",
            "If you're what I consider a conservative (I'm not a conservative fyi), then you have a whole lot more in common with Biden than you do with the majority of the current Republican party. The republican party is not a conservative party at this point, it's more of a right wing reactionary party, which is quite different.",
            "You might disagree with him on some social  issues, and he\u2019s old. He does listen to a solid team of established experts, which mitigates the effects of being old other than occasionally saying profoundly stupid shit on accident. But also, it\u2019s Joe Biden, so saying profoundly stupid shit on accident is kind of a signature move.\n\nOn the positive side, I would like to highlight that his foreign policy has done a lot to inexpensively advance US interests abroad and regain a lot of positive reputation that was lost over the past few decades.",
            "The problem with Biden is that there are two Democratic parties, two Republican parties, and 3/4 of them don't like him very much.\n\nThe lunatic fringe of the Republican party firmly believes he's a lizard person deep state communist who's simultaneously bent on destroying America, grooming children, taking payoffs from Ukraine, and is also suffering from severe dementia.  That some of these theories are mutually exclusive doesn't trouble them much.  He could cure cancer tomorrow and they'd be celebrating dying of cancer rather than take the ~~COVID-19~~ cancer vaccine.\n\nThe moderate Republicans (spoiler alert, there aren't very many of them left) don't much care for him but are probably secretly grateful he isn't a cheap dim-witted incompetent orange carnival barker.  Mostly they're going to look the other way because without the first group, they'd be getting 30% of the vote every other November.\n\nThe two wings of the Democratic party, on the other hand, are dissatisfied with him in different ways.  The moderates think he's a little too liberal, but they're willing to forgive that because he's a boomer, and on some level, just the fact that he's a million years old is appealing to them.  The moderates are older.\n\nThe liberal wing of the Democratic party, on the other hand, think he's too moderate, and don't much care for a president that could be their grandfather.  They've seen quite a few of those guys.  They don't want to hear about the dangerous precedent that would be set by prosecuting a political opponent, they want Trump in jail.\n\nAll this is to say, the dissatisfaction with Biden on the (far) right is that he bested their swordsman, and the dissatisfaction on the left is that he's half a loaf.  Too crazy for boystown and too much of a boy for crazytown.\n\nOn a side note, this is why *Dark Brandon* tends to play pretty well nowadays.  Whenever he throws chin-music the liberal wing of the Democrats love it because it's always leaning (further) left, and the moderate wings are both older.  They love it for the same reason they keep attending [action movies headlined by a 70-year old man](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0936501/) beating the crap out of kids in their 20's: because it's *porn for boomers*.",

            "A lot of the Right don't like him because \"not Trump,\" plain and simple. Strong leftists don't care for him because he's not pushing for the stuff they'd like to see.",
            "Hey I'm a conservative who likes biden too.  You should check out the Tuesday crowd.  Not all conservatives are caught up in this Maga crap.",
            "I don\u2019t care about his age. I care about results. Trump was a *terrible* statesman who couldn\u2019t even get rid of Obamacare when he had Congress behind him. Trump was too busy picking fights with John McCain instead of building a conservative coalition. \n\nBiden in the other hand gets bills signed.",
            "Answer: It's all about what color you vote for.  There has always been a political divide.  I was an intern in the WH during Clinton and Capitol under Dole, thus working for both parties.  Back then, both parties wanted to improve the country, they just disagreed on how to do it.  There were countless meetings on compromise.  The focus was on how to meet in the middle.  The political divide widen a bit during the Bush/Gore fiasco and then Iraq.  However, things widen when Obama was elected.  Not only was it severe economic turmoil, but a black democrat in the WH.  Republicans withdrew from governing and moved toward obstruction.  Obama was handcuffed by the economic conditions so he couldn't focus on improving the country, he had to focus on saving the country.  It was at this time I moved from moderate right, to moderate left.  My interest was in governing and helping American citizens.  \n\nThen Trump came along and the Republican party line turned to playing the victim and owning the libs.  I teach a political economics course and we spend an entire semester analyzing policies of past administrations and what future policies could look like.  When we get to the Trump era, there's just nothing there, just Republicans playing the victim.  We have some immigration policies, trade policies,  and the 2017 tax cuts, but that's it.  \n\nBiden is trying to govern.  Every policy he has proposed or introduced to help families (childcare, pre-k, healthcare, maternity leave, etc), the Republicans have opposed 100%.  The Republicans even voted against the child tax credit.  This is a policy I was heavily involved with.  During COVID, we changed the tax credit from an annual tax credit to a monthly cash deposit.  No increase in money.  This simple change reduced the cost of the policy to taxpayers.  It also reduced child poverty and child food insecurity.  It's a rare (very rare) win-win policy. When it came time to make the monthly payments permanent, Republicans 100% voted against it.  Child poverty and child food insecurity instantly spiked within one quarter.  \n\nI was in a committee meeting these past few months on childcare, another policy I'm heavily involved in.  The Biden admin wants to make childcare/pre-k universal, which is what all other developed nations do.  The economic benefits of childcare are significant.  The Republicans make it crystal clear they will never vote for universal childcare regardless of the benefits.  Instead, they are proposing childcare loans similar to student loans.  Yes, you heard that correctly. They are suggesting the treasury department loan money to families to pay for childcare.  I laughed out loud in their face when they brought this up.  It is the dumbest idea I've ever heard.  We want to put families into debt to pay for childcare.  The same families that already can't buy a home because of student loan debt.  We want to add more. \n\nLet me be crystal clear about something and this may sound dramatic, but it's the economic truth.  Given our fertility rate, if we as a country do not reduce the obstacles to families having kids, our country will seize to exist.  Other developed nations recognized this fact decades ago and worked on putting policies in place to encourage childbirth.  We have yet to recognize that despite our fertility rate dropping below 2.0.  Universal childcare/pre-k and maternity leave should be classified as national security types of policies, assuming we want our nation to be secure. \n\nSo you ask what is wrong with Biden?  The problem is that he's trying to improve the country and he's a Democrat.  The Republicans will not allow a democrat to have any success because that reduces their chances of gaining power.  In the meantime, Americans and America suffer.  Biden is not a great president, but he is the perfect type of person to follow the Trump train wreck.",

            "I'm just here to say that in a time of invasion, there have been a little over 7,000 civilian deaths in Ukraine. In an invasion. By a country that has shown zero regard for human life.\n\nIn 2022 alone, the US had 642 registerd mass shootings and over 44,000 homicides with a firearm involved (this includes the deaths in those mass shootings and any other homicide resulting from a gun). With no invasion by a foreign military.\n\nI understand 44,000 is lower than the 7,000 or so in Ukraine when you factor in population percentages, but I repeat, there is no war or invasion in the United States.\n\nI will never understand someone defending the right to own assault weapons. It will never make sense to me. Every argument in support of them is just so bad and nonsensical.\n\nI understand I did not answer your question, I just get irritated by people who get upset that someone wants to \"take muh guns.\" I say this as someone who began voting in 2012 and had voted red in 2012 and 2016. I voted for Trump the first time. And I will never go back to the GOP. Not saying I'm a die hard Democrat because they mostly suck ass too, but god damn the GOP is a legitimate danger to society.",

Immigrant Caravans, Hunter Biden's Laptop, Hillary's Emails, etc.  Eventually it all just gets wrapped up into a general feeling of nameless, formless hate, directed at Biden, or Democrats, or whatever else is the out-group du jour.  Certainly Biden is not perfect, but he at least acknowledges the problems facing the country.",

I did not vote for him, but I fully support the president we elected.\n\nHis policies are further left than I like, but that is to be expected. He is rational, pleasant, and consistent. He does not embarrass us on the world stage.\n\nWhat we see is the same as it has always been. Politics. When one stops listening to the pundits and avoid opinion as much as possible it is possible to get a less biased view of what is going on.\n\nPresident Biden has brought a bit of dignity back to the office. It has been declining for a while. For this he should be admired, along with the fact that he is doing a pretty good job.",
            "Joe Biden is middle of the road. The GOP has just become the party of insanity, dysfunction, and a comical level of ignorance when it comes to American history. So they paint Joe as some far left nut.",

            "Quite a few Conservative folks like to poke fun at his stammer, which includes a bit of aphasia when he tries to select a word to replace the one his stammer focuses on. And while, yes, Biden is considerably older than many Presidents, they take his speech disability and blow it up into an attack on his mental acuity. Given Trump's own mockery of those with disabilities, I'm certainly not shocked by this. I'm more shocked that Conservatives ignore Trump's own very obvious decline. The man makes up WORDS and not even in an ironic way. Just plain old makes up WORDS. \n\nOtherwise, Conservatives dislike him because he beat their idol Trump. Dear Gods, someone had to. A left leaning moderate who has a LONG history of working across the aisle and genuinely very much liked in Congress, Biden had the history and reputation to do so. Especially given the work that had to be done, given the pandemic, world events, etc. \n\nConservatives see Biden's long career in public service as a detriment, though there are multiple Republicans who have done the same. And while Biden's political stances have GROWN and progressed, along with American culture/society, they like to throw his older statements around to prove \"something\". I'm not sure what. Maybe that time exists and people grow? (Like they SHOULD, mind you.)\n\nNow for Liberals - we wanted another Obama. We wanted a younger, charming and dynamic President. Hell, Democrats LOVE a dynamic President - think FDR, JFK Bill Clinton, Barak Obama.  We like Biden fine. We LOVED him as the VP for Obama, tearing up when he empathized with Americans. But we wanted someone MORE Liberal, more of a firecracker, someone who can deliver a soulful, timeless speech like Obama. Basically, we wanted Obama 2.0. And that's not particularly fair to Biden. But damnit, we were OWED after Trump. \n\nHonestly, I cannot speak for Moderates. I'm not sure I understand what Moderates want except less drama in politics. They want people to enjoy their human and civil rights (near as I can tell) without the ongoing attacks. They want to go to work, come home, eat a meal, etc. without more drama out of D.C. \n\nHonestly, I'd love that too. Hey, we Democrats aren't perfect. But the other party is clearly insane. \n\nWith one party stuck in the fictional world of an over-idealized 1950s, with a chicken in every pot, and an America built for WASPs, while they elect fabulists like George Santos and wingnuts like MTG and pedo protectors Jim Jordan, and sex service purveyors like Matt Gaetz, we're JUST not going to get that out of D.C.",

            "If I'm remembering Hellsing correctly, the invitation needs to be extended again.",
            "By the lore of [Dracula Untold](https://fictionhorizon.com/why-do-vampires-have-to-be-invited-in/), the reason why vampires have to be allowed into households is because such households have a magical barrier that's powered by the strength of the family inside of it and their affinity to the house. By this reasoning, the barrier of entry to vampires is entirely dependent on who lives there. A vampire who was allowed in once may have a harder time if a new family with much stronger bonds takes over.\n\n[The wiki page for The Vampire Diaries](https://vampirediaries.fandom.com/wiki/Invitation) is mostly aligned with this, and even goes as far as offering an origin story for this setup. BUT, it also explicitly argues that the terms of the magical barrier ARE influenced by legal documentation and real estate ownership.\n\n>Ownership can apparently be tampered with, as the magical protection is based on signed legal documents. This was seen when the <spoiler> opted to bestow ownership to the <spoiler> House to <spoiler> so she could use it as a safe house...\n\n><spoiler> was able to bypass the protection of <spoiler> Mansion in a similar manner by having a city official to invoke eminent domain upon the home, giving it heritage status and therefore making the home open to the public without invitation.\n\nSo this may be a question for /r/realestate or /r/legaladviceofftopic, since the answer depends entirely on real-world laws. I'm no expert on this matter, but if I had to guess, it'd be like this: If you were a home owner and you offered a guest free and unequivocal access to your home, your guest would have no legal right to enter the home again if you transferred ownership of the home to someone else (unless it's otherwise written into the terms of a signed legal document).",
            "The generally accepted reason that vampires have to be invited in has to do with the status of the inhabitants of the \u201chome,\u201d rather than the physical location. The idea is that it is the person living within the home that has the power to lower the protective barrier they have created through their presence. A new family would probably create a new barrier, thus needing a new invitation.",

The idea of inviting a vampire into your house is quite old, and is likely tied up into the concept of hospitality. \n\n------\n\nEdit: also u/EvryMthrF_ngThrd has suggested that the explicit references to threshold protection common in vampire lore have to do with the Jewish celebration of Passover, which makes perfect sense to me and is a super cool connection!\n\n------\n\nOur current definition of hospitality - being a good host who sees to the needs of his or her guests - is pretty accurate to the definition that was used historically. However, the idea of being a good host was bore a *great deal* more weight than it does now, partly because travel was so extremely arduous before the invention of things like cars and trains. \n\nTravellers sometimes needed to seek shelter for the night at random strangers' houses, because they often had no other option. Traveling at night could be very dangerous, or maybe you were caught in a sudden storm, or whatever. And it's not like there were always proper inns and stuff around. If you were out in the wilderness and there was just one random house on the road, you basically had to stop and see if they would let you in, or risk death due to exposure. It seems super weird to us because nobody these days can genuinely claim that they *need* to be let into a stranger's house to crash on the couch for the night or they might legitimately die, but I'm sure you can see how or why that might have been something that happened in the past, when people typically travelled on horseback or foot over long distances.\n\nThis is, by the way, why stories like Beauty and the Beast start with the weird trope of some old poor lady coming to the door to ask for shelter and food. It was generally socially expected for someone to offer hospitality unless they had a specific reason not to, and his refusal to do so is made more egregious because he's wealthy (and can obviously afford to provide for her for the night) and because she's an elderly lady (and so obviously isn't a threat to him, especially given that he'd have guards in the castle).\n\nAnd that's kind of the thing. These guests aren't always frail, elderly ladies, and most people don't have guards, so this arrangement put both guest and host in *obvious* danger. What if the dude who came to your door is an axe-murderer? What if the person who owns this random house in the woods is secretly a cannibal?\n\nSo... that's why hospitality was such a big deal, back then. If you invited someone in, there was an implied social agreement involved that mattered *a lot* to both parties. Basically, it was a promise that the host would do what they could to ensure the safety, comfort and security of their guest (within reason), and the guest would provide the host and their home with the respect and gratitude deserved in exchange. It was a social necessity to have this sort of \"sacred code\" of hospitality because otherwise no host would *ever* agree to let someone in, and travelling would become *so much more dangerous* as a result.\n\nNow, obviously, one party could be a liar and plan to break this implied oath as soon as they were given the chance, but that's why there's so much mythology around the idea of hospitality - it was, in part, a matter of enforcement. Many, many, *many* ancient religions include an explicit god of the hearth who would *fuck you up* if you broke one of the expected tenets of hospitality because that was considered a personal insult to the god. Many homes had spirits which would mess with you and steal things from you if you broke hospitality. Any culture with some variation on fairies in their mythology typically include the idea that these fairies take hospitality *incredibly* seriously and will curse the hell out of you if you break it. A lot of mythology surrounds the sacred nature of respecting hospitality, because it was just such a ridiculously important thing that could really damage a society if it wasn't respected.\n\nAnd so... that's why vampires require an invitation. The idea there is basically that a vampire *cannot* enter your home without invoking hospitality from you. Of course, they're obviously going to then break that hospitality, which was, at the time, viewed as nearly an affront to nature, not far gone from the dead returning to life. It's a warning that not all who accept your hospitality will hold to the expected behaviours of a gracious guest, and it's an insult to those who do break the rules of hospitality (as a guest, specifically) by casting them as evil parasites. \n\nTo that end, you would need to re-invite them, because you are not bound by hospitality that may or may not have been offered by the previous owner of your home.",

            "Haven't thought about this aspect for a long time...\n\nBasically, the idea comes from household magic. In it, crossing a threshold is an entry into the domain of the home holder. Threshold protection depends on the home holder. The longer the home is held (lived in by the home holder), the stronger the protection gets, so uninvited \"guests\" become weaker, and less able to do malignant things. \n\nThe way I read the law, change of home holder means loss of the threshold protection magic. It takes \"spells\" (or length of ownership) to build up the protection. SO, if the previous owners/holders had invited a vampire (or other bad spirit or evil magician) in, the bad guy would be able to enter at will. That's why so many places get cleansed after the ownership changes hands. This brings the household back to more or less neutral, and allows a new \"resistance\" to evil to develop.\n\nHence you'd need to do a cleansing ritual and a new protection ritual to keep the vampire outside or reduce its power within the dwelling.\n\n(entities CAN cross thresholds without permission or invitation. But doing so can reduce their considerable powers to virtually zero. They'd have to rely on pure physical power, which would make them no stronger than the people already in the house.)\n\nOh, the whole thing is about HOME, not the property itself. If you rent a place, and make it your HOME, threshold magic applies, even if you don't actually own the property.",

Live ants they don't bother...\n\nhttps://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/3509_eowilson.html",
            "Generally this doesnt happen at all. Bees are basically little robots that live to serve the hive. If it were to happen, then no. The other bees wouldn't care. I doubt they even have the cognitive capability to notice",
            "Bees in general aren't lazy by design. As they age up their jobs change and that's their main source of fulfillment... so a lazy person is being lazy because they don't want to do anything/would rather do something else. For a bee there /is/ nothing else. A lazy bee might be a sick bee and in that case it would likely be dispatched.\n\nBees do however take rests! Like breaks. So there may be a bee or two who gets a longer break, sort of like being lazy, but they usually help out with 'easier' hive tasks on these breaks.\n\nDrones, on the other hand, are lazy bees. They can only help the hive by flying off to pass on their queen's bloodline, a job they only get to do once if at all. They don't do anything else--no wax production, no brood rearing, no guarding, nothing. In winter as the weather cools down the females in the hive actually hold out mass evictions and kick all the drones out of the hive to die. \n\nIn other words bees aren't too stingy but you better bee useful!",
            "This is a very interesting question and almost impossible to answer.\n\nThe life of a individual female bee has several phases. It depends on the season, the weather and the location. In her first two days she cleans the cells. Then she feeds the older beemaggots, later the younger ones. After she is older thean 10 days she may start to leave the hive to get orientation. After day 13, she has to produce wax, to manage the incomming honey or pollen and she has to carry out bees, which passed away. Producing wax seems to be the most exhausting job at all. From day 19 on, she becomes a gardian bee and protects the hive. After she is older than 25 days, she is allowed to fly and collect. And there are stand-by bees: in case of hot days they have to collect water or to cool down the hive. (A bee hive is like a complex organism and one of the rare non mammals with the ability to control the temperature.) Some have to heat, if is is getting very cold. If some bees are lost due to an invasion (mouse, wasp, other bees) or a sudden thunderstorm, their duties are rearranged but always in the same ascending order and the days to be in certain phase may vary according to the demands of the hive. This is the life of a working bee. \n\nA queen bee does nothing but producing eggs. In spring, she might deceide to leave the hive with one half of the bees and let a bee princess take over. \n\nThe male bees, drones, are maybe the lazy ones. They have to fertilize the queen on her honeymoon-flight. In autumn drones are kicked out. Some beekeepers think drones can be avoided and cut out the male maggots. I do a lot of watching bees. To me, they seem to be more happy as long as drones are around. Drones make long distance flights and are regarded to be a part of the bee communication by some scientists. But finally, we do not know. We do not really understand this animal, ecspecially how they solve problems and come to decisions. We do not really know much about their communication, but it seems they do not only dance, but also use electric fields and drum sounds.\n\nSo, to make it short, it is almost not possible to answer your question, because you cannot detect the difference between a bee on standby or just a lazy one. It might also be possible, that a single bee is \"lazy\" in wax production, but a very skillfull and motivated guardian. If there is not much stress for the hive (perfect weather, no ilness, no mites), I would guess that they spread the good life and become a little more relaxed all together. And: hives as a whole have different \u201epersonalities\u201c, some are very busy, some are more agressive than others and some are more curious, whats going on.   \n\nI would like to add some sources, but I have only read books about bees in German. Your local library will sure help you to find further literature in your language.  \n\n\nSorry for mistakes. I am not a native speaker and did not write English for years. Derusting this is one of my corona aims.",

They kind of bonk right into them, sometimes make a whoop sound and then climb on top of the other bee or use their front legs and shake them vigorously. They use it right before swarming and in a few other situations to get all of the bees on the same page and acting with immediate coordination. There\u2019s a group that will run around head butting others and hyping them up until they do what they are supposed to be doing.

He did say that there is a disease that causes wings to shrivel up meaning many bees can't leave the hive to gather pollen and the bees can only wonder about the hive and do nothing, those bees aren't given any trouble and are left to their aimless wondering.\n\nHe also said that if a hive has just swarmed and found a new home and a bee starts the \"waggle dance\", essentially saying \"hey guys I found this great place let's go there\", the other bees will head butt it to stop it from dancing so that they don't have to leave again so soon.\n\nI hope this has helped!",

            "Bees don't have the ability to judge one another, some inevitably provide more for the hive than the others, but they are all only working according to their instincts. Certain other insect species (some types of beetles, some ant-mimic spiders) are able to use pheromones to stealthily reside in ant nests, basically mooching off the ants food, sometimes actively harming the ants through parasitism. Yet the ants ignore them, as long as they have the right scent. Lazy ants and lazy bees don't get punished, but to even *bee* lazy as a social insect would probably mean something is seriously wrong with its brain, since they all have the same hardwired  programming.",
            "No, social hymenoptera of all sorts are just programmed with specific sets of instinctive behaviors, so they don't actually observe and make judgements about the behaviors of their fellows in most circumstances. \n\nIf a bee seems too old/weak/sick/unhealthy smelling, then the other workers will grab her and drag her out of the hive to die alone because her usefulness to the hive is outweighed by the risk her deterioration poses. Bees are not sentimental. On any given day in the summer hundreds or thousands of bees might die in a hive and they just haul out the corpses and keep going. Lucky for them most bees have their wings fracture when they attempt to take off with a full load of pollen/nectar/propolis, which means they wander about and starve to death far from the hive. A stranger bee from a different hive that returns to the wrong hive is usually greeted positively because they spit delicious nectar into the mouths of the first bee that might bother them. \n\nA bee hive is basically one organism with its many parts separated into individual bees with different functions. So this question is like asking if the cells in your body that are lazy get harassed by the other cells for being lazy. It just doesn't make much sense when one has the proper perspective. For example, male bees, drones, don't do anything in the hive but consume honey waiting for a young queen to pass by. Then they chase her, and either fail to catch her, or mate with her and die in the process with a tiny \"pop\". So a drone is essentially a perfectly lazy bee that never does anything at all useful in the hive, because his job is to stay fresh and fueled up at all times so that he is ready to spread the hive's genetics. Like a penis, a drone just sits there flapping about until one day it's ridiculousness of single purpose all makes sense.",

Males only exist to impregnate a queen, all worker bees in a colony are female. Since the father bee only had half it's genes, each female worker bee gets 100% of the father's genes but a random set of 50% of the mothers. So the daughter bee only shares 50% of her genes with her mother, but 75% of her genes with her sisters. Each has the same matching set from dad but only a half matching set from mom. This means from the perspective of gene propogation, it is better for a bee to assist her queen birth more sisters than it would bee for her to have her own daughters. This is thought to bee one of the main driving forces behind their highly social behavior. In a nut shell, a bee in a colony has little selective pressure to bee lazy, as far as evolution is concerned, it would bee better for a given bee to work itself to death helping her queen than it would be to conserve energy and live a longer life to have her own babies. This is actually what happens, the worker bees who go out and collect pollen tend to live very short lives.

            "I am a single woman, no kids, mid 30ies. I noticed that friendships drift apart when people are having kids. Children are time consuming and priorities change. As a single person, you have to adapt massively to keep in touch (visits during the day, less/no evening activities anymore, plans follow the kids' schedules). Some people around me are having their second child now (first one already 5 or older) and I am a little bummed because this whole ordeal starts again right when I thought it was getting better and more relaxed now. That's why I am kind of hesitant to engage a lot with these people. Our lives differ so much. New parents always talk about their kids and being a parent, they often completely forget themselves as a person. It's exhausting and I can understand why people are not crazy about newborns.",

Sometimes I was able to visit no problem.  However, two things happened that would sometimes make it harder or prevent me from going:\n\n1.  When I expressed interest in a quick visit, no one in the family responded affirmatively.  I knew others were able to go, but they were usually close female friends/family of the mom. \n\n2.  I was basically told that it was \"weird\" for me to want to go see a newborn baby (and the parents). This criticism came from both men amd women equally.  They saw my interest as \"unmanly\".  Sometimes this also included the parents.\n\nIs it normal for guys to visit friends who have just had a baby?  I honestly have no idea and don't really care.  My goal when a friend has a baby is to be supportive, however that looks: Visits, useful gifts, a nice card, a text/phone call, or even just giving them lots of space so I'm not gonna be another person they have to manage in the whirlwind of having a newborn to take care of.   Too many people think it's \"their right\" to see the baby and I'm not one of them.  I only want to help and don't want to make things harder, so I will only come by with an expressed invitation when it's clear I'm not going to be an obligation.  \n\nBut, sometimes society just isn't okay with men showing interest in certain things that are considered \"feminine\", such as caring and support.... no matter how fucking stupid these views of traditional gender roles may be.",

Second, they are your friends, so even if they aren't thrilled about meeting the baby (which are honestly quite boring), they should be excited to support you for something that means a lot. \n\nOffering to host them as your friends (beer, pizza, video games - whatever y'all are into) and not as a new parent signals that you want their support as a friend.",

            "Having people come see a one week is against doctor recommendations. A baby getting sick is awful, and they can't have tylenol for the first two months. You are supposed to keep the baby away from crowds until then.

Let's face it, newborns are ugly and ridiculously boring potato sacks.",
            "If I like the friend then I will meet them, regardless or whether or not they have a child.\n\nIn one case, we are a bunch of  folks who have a boardgame night. One person always brought his wife, she is nice enough and likes to play the games too, so that's fine. Then they had a kid, and we shifted instead to having boardgame nights at their house. It's a little further out for the rest of us (I was the one located equidistantly from the others) but it's no big deal. They both join, unless there's an issue with the kid, in which case only one of them will. Maybe it helps that most of the rest of us also have kids, so we're understanding and flexible.\n\nIn another case, I used to go for hikes with my friend. Then she had a kid, so I just go round to her place by myself. If it's good weather she'll plonk the kid in a pram and we'll stroll around the neighbourhood and chat. If it's bad outside, we'll make some tea and snacks, I'll sit at the table while she gets up and does stuff with the kid, and she'll sit down when she's able. It's an \"I exist in your space\" type of thing.\n\nThe key thing in both scenarios is, the parents do their thing with the kids as needed, and the rest of us just sit at the side and do other things if the parents are busy. We aren't getting babies shoved in our face, we aren't forced to hold or play or interact unless we choose to, and the parents themselves are still the same people but with extra responsibilities, rather than getting laser-focused on The Baby as some parents do. It's a thing in their life, not the core of their whole existence.\n\ntl;dr it partly depends on how their behaviour changes and partly on whether you can be comfortable not being the centre of attention for the duration of your visit.",

Over and over, men feel unsupported in their lives and here is a man who is reaching out to his support system to celebrate his life, and nobody is bothering to show up. And the response from men on reddit is that they would stop giving a fuck too just cause, oh the horror! They're a dad now.

IIRC, I allowed one friend to come by a week after my first son because she had a baby two days before me and lived in a tiny apartment.  I lived in a huge house with a ton of space so we spent a lot of those early mom days together there.  I don't remember any of my friends having early visitors either.  Mostly, people scheduled a time, dropped casseroles at my front door, rang the door bell, and left because it isn't good to have a lot of germs coming into your home with a new baby.\n\nOn the other end of this, other than my dad, we had no male visitors for the babies.  They didn't care I guess and it made sense to me.  I am a woman, and when I have visited friends with infants , I aim to come when the baby naps.  From having been a postpartum mom before, my emphasis in visiting a new mother is on the mother, not the baby.  I go in and quickly do a load of dishes (without asking... because women tend to turn down offers of assistance even if they want it) or some other quick task that can take the pressure off a new mom.  If there's nothing obvious to help with, I sit with the mom and focus on HER.  New moms tend to need a lot of support, but rarely get it.",

The best thing a guy friend can do is bring some takeout or drop off a Walmart or Amazon card and let the new dad know they\u2019re still important.\n\nOn the flip side, as a dad myself, I could not and did not care whether any of my friends came to visit my kids when they were infants.  Entertaining company while taking care of a baby is low on my list of good times.",

            "To...what? Look at the baby? It doesn't...do anything. It can't talk about anything. You might have already had a shower where we could do a gift to help you out... \n\nJust... yes that is a baby. Its a weird little potato like all babies. Congrats!"

They will portray Mexico as some very, very dangerous place, that is so fucking cool, because it is dangerous. Like, it is always exciting, but you would never, ever wanna live there.\n\n\n2. Drugs. Mexico is all about drugs. If there were no drugs, Mexicans people would starve. Drugs are cool, too. But, damn, Mexico, why ya'll fucked up with the drugs?

Some parts ARE very dangerous (SOMETIMES) and scary, and the people there HATE it. It is not cool. It is not sexy, or exciting. \nThe people are very average looking.

Anyway, they told stories around the US and occasionally elsewhere, like Japan and India.\n\nTo make things less confusing for the viewer, they put a filter on all scenes depending on where it was supposed to take place. New York City was blue, Japan was green, LA was crisp and clear, Texas was yellow of course. It's a little hint that you might not even consciously notice.

            "There was a very good interview with James Fallows on NPR's *On the Media* podcast recently, wherein he pointed out that there's *always* something wrong with one Presidential candidate or another.\n\nThey may be too \"establishment,\" or too much an outsider. They may be too old. They may be too young. And that's going to be because every President is going to be judged against some theoretical (and I'd argue impossible) ideal. In some ways, this is what's going on with President Biden. He's old. The oldest President to serve. But there's no indication, yet, that his age is actually inhibiting his service, despite what conservative media is desperate for you to believe. He's a little slower in speech, a little slower in thought, and a little slower in movement. But the President need not be quick to any of those things. His job is to listen to advisors, carefully weigh his options, and choose wisely. In some sense, \"older\" can be better.\n\nAnother thing that's happening is that the media is trying desperately not to appear too partisan. And to some extent, so are voters who like to think of themselves as independent-minded. Donald Trump is mired in the objectively worst scandals in American presidential history. No President has ever before been accused of attempting to overturn an election result by violence. No President has ever before stolen classified documents, hidden them intentionally from authorities, doubled down when caught red handed, and proudly displayed them for members of the public who were in no way authorized to see them. In some way, \"Biden's too old\" is a way of sounding dispassionate about Donald Trump, a way of allowing one to pretend that \"both sides are bad.\"",

A corporation is fully separate from the owner (shareholder), and in court and for tax purposes, they are treated like a separate person, which is why you file a corporate tax return.\n\nIn other words, a corporation can go bankrupt, but that will have little bearing on the owner (shareholder). Corporations have the privilege of being able to file for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy which simply allows the corporation to reorganize the company, whereas individuals can only file Chapter 7 (liquidate all your assets to discharge all your debts) or Chapter 13 (3 to 5 year repayment plan that discharges your debts). Both have a negative impact on an individual's credit score.\n\nIn other words, rich people are rich because they know tax and business law better and take full advantage.",

You form a company specifically for this purpose.  You put in $1mm of your own money and get a $2mm loan.  Ultimately it turns out it was a dumb idea, and all the money goes down the toilet.  The $2mm loan liability is limited to this company, which means the lender might not get anything back.  The lender can't go against your personal assets (usually) or your other companies.  (This is a good thing -- if this was not the case, this would be a serious deterrent against starting a company.  Lenders therefore judge the credit risk of a company on the basis of its assets alone, not taking into account the owner's other assets.) \n\nSupposedly, Trump has done tons of deals/companies and only a few have gone bankrupt, which (if true) is not alarming or evil.",

You can get approved for a small - moderate size loan, but if you do your interest rate will be significantly higher than if you had that savings to fall back on. This trend becomes increasingly vast as the net assets of an individual increases, allowing wealthy individuals to get massive loans with minimal interest compared to those that are deemed a risk to the bank. \n\nAs was also mentioned elsewhere in this thread, a common trend among banks is a type of elite club for people meeting a certain threshold of net assets.

Basically the corporation is the one that owns the real estate (normally only 1 parcel), and takes out all of the debt.  If you are successful, you are the sole owner of a corporation that owns the building.  If the venture loses money, that corporation goes into BK.  At that point, as the owner you are wiped out (you lose the business), and your creditors either take the assets or it is sold off for their benefit.  So if your business fails, all you  lose is the business.\n\nSo someone like trump may have had a few dozen high profile businesses that owned one parcel (ie trump tower).  If it works, it works and he now likely has a business that owns a parcel with 1b that owes about 1b.  If it is close, you may be able to renegotiate to retain owership.  Your business is still worth very little as the assets and liabilities are still close.  Do that long term, and those debts get paid off, and the property values go up, and there is your actual profit (often the only real gains are in the property value going up since they are balloon loans).  If he fails and spent 1b on a parcel worth 500m, the business declares BK, and the creditors take over (or a bk trustee sells it off for them).",

Companies are trying to make the world a better place by creating products and services of value and jobs for workers who otherwise wouldn't create those products and services on their own. If the business fails, that sucks and will have a cost to all who started it (both financially and emotionally). If you fail to manage your own finances properly that is because of bad decisions that benefited no one but yourself. No jobs were created because of that personal failure, and no attempt to create products and services for society either. Personal bankruptcy is due to bad decisions and bad luck of an individual.\n\nas far as getting loans are concerned, let's say you were the guy that created blockbuster video back in the '90s. That was a very successful business until it failed because the market changed in online streaming services became the new rave.

I second everyone in this thread for telling him in private(though I will say you should ask/notify your boss before you do, so you're not accused of harrassing him or something), but I did want to bring up the potential for there legitimately being a medical problem. My mother had a coworker whem she worked in her office -- a *very* tall, not-very-thin woman (I woulsn't say \"fat\", partially because I don't like the term, and partially because she wasn't morbidly obese) who smelled terrible.

One day, my mom couldn't take it anymore and decided to talk to her about it (in private).\n\n\nIt turns out that she has a serious condition with her sweat glands, and normal deoderant wasn't really affective. She also opened up to my mother that her condition caused her to not have a lot of friends. She said that her smell, and her being a particularly tall(she was like, 6'4), not conventionally attractive woman (not saying she was ugly, just that the media likes to pay attention to thin, blonde, short women) really hurt her self-esteem. She and my mom kind of became friends, and my mom always kept extra stuff in her office to help with her smell if she forgot her stuff that day. My point to all this is that you should make sure that you just treat whatever you do with care and kindness. This guy might not be a pig. He may legimately have a medical issue. Even if he has a high-paying job, he may not have enough to invest in deoderant - my older cousin makes over 80k a year, but he has an ailing mother who's mortage he's paying for, and a younger brother that he helps too, so he has a small apartment as a result.

In the Middle East, the general opinion is \u201cWhy should I cover up my natural scent?\u201d In India, it\u2019s thought of as \u201cNot my problem.\u201d\n\nIn addition to culture, it could be dietary.

If you think the urge to move is impacting your sleep or it\u2019s causing you distress, I\u2019d investigate it further. Otherwise it might just be a normal thing :)\n\nEDIT: so, this post blew up, and for the sake of clarity I want to say that I\u2019m not a medical professional.

            "Research stimming. Everyone does it, neurotypicals and neurodivergents. It can basically be any repetitive motion that soothes or comforts you, like rocking, rubbing your feet together, rubbing your fingers together, twirling your hair, tapping...in more extreme cases, like with people on the spectrum, people may hit things or themselves, flap their hands, making loud noises, and so on.\n\nThere's another term, \"rituals\", which is similar to stimming in that you have to do a certain thing in order to feel safe or comfortable. Extreme cases are seen is obsessive compulsive disorder, where you may feel absolutely certain that if you don't turn the light on and off 5 times in a row, the house will burn down while you sleep. \n\nIf you feel that if you can't sleep without rocking yourself, it may be a bit of stimming and a ritual...it comforts you and you can't sleep until you've done it. Or perhaps you've conditioned yourself over the years by rocking yourself to sleep that your brain views it as necessary to falling asleep. Some people feel like they can't sleep if they haven't brushed their teeth or set their hair a certain way. \n\nPsychology is extremely interesting and I recommend researching the terms above. I'm curious what started this behavior in you though. Like what made you feel like you had to rock yourself?",

I used to do it for hours in the initial detoxing phase because the restless leg syndrome was so bad but now I do it every night for a few minutes until I pass out. It doesn't take me ages to knock off anymore. \n\nWhen I was a kid, i had a pretty shitty set of parents. I used to rub my baby blanket in between my toes. When I got older and actually started seeking help for my issues, I learned this is a natural grounding technique for anxious people.
