Once a subreddit gets past a certain community size, it just because a conglomerate of all the other main subreddits, reposting all the same posts and ideas. \nIt\u2019s really unfortunate but I think the reason why this happens is because the people that actually care about the subreddits niche is outnumbered by lurkers and other people that really don\u2019t know what they are talking about. I think this is similar to what happens when Americans are exposed to a controversy in a country that they have never even thought about, and then they give their solution without having any real context.\nI don\u2019t have a good solution for limiting communities but I don\u2019t think that you should be allowed to contribute just because you have an account",

Many of the questions asked here could technically go in any other sub. If the question doesn't appeal to you, downvote it or hide it and it won't bother you any further.\n\nThanks.",

            "I'm aggregating what I've seen here, and doing a bit of googling, the only years we reference with such simple shorthand as \"the 20s\" are within 100 years. This is likely simply because they are distant enough to have gone through the filter as a whole, roughly 5-10 years minimum, and gained a certain personality. Much like how the 20s are mostly thought of as a big party after The Great War, and the 30s can be considered loosely as a hangover after the party, at least in allied countries. We can assign these attributes through the lens of history with the help of those that lived then, which conveniently leads me to my next point, which is human life span.\n\nThe 100 year limitation on these familiar terms, while likely a point of convenience so we literally don't have to ask \"which one\", is also where our actual, living familiarity ends, and the dust seems to mostly settle, historically and archeologically speaking. We have a fairly firm idea of their personality, and the interpretation can't much be altered by eyewitness accounts or publishings from those who lived then, as the vast, VAST majority of them have died or been rendered inert by age. Minor revelations can be made, but after the ~100 years of familiarity pass, we start calling them by their full year number. \n\nThis is just me aggregating the impressions and information I have and throwing in my two cents, so obviously don't give anything I've said too much credit, but I found the subject an interesting thought",

            "Yeah, this is another one of those tropes that teachers give you. The next level, whatever that is, will be soooo much harder, so you'd better stop complaining because you have it easy now.\n\nBoth teachers and bosses can be shitty. And maybe a shitty teacher is worse because it's an adult being awful to a child who has no choice about being there.",

            "You are blessed.  I am 50 -and I have had my share of asshole bosses.  From the \"I am a manager\" attitude, to the ones that are threatened because you are more talented than them.  What it has taught me is that bad bosses are only temporary - and if you ride it out, they will be gone.  Same thing goes with bad teachers - pacify them to get you thru the school year.  It is temporary........ learn from it to help you be better suited in the real world.",
            "The power differences and differences in maturity make those two kinds of relationships drastically different. Those two roles also have very different responsibilities and expectations for your own conduct. Teachers just like saying things to make you obey, eg permanent record, you'll need cursive, college will be worse, in reality this is a person trying to have authority over a group of children, and that the personality they have will drastically shape how they accomplish this. I've had several teachers that I would even call friends, and others that I could say very unkind things about. The expression is indeed, bs.",
            "I've had bosses that were straight up verbally abusive, I've had bosses so incompetent I've had to do their job, I've had bosses try to assault me. I think you've been pretty lucky.",
            "Bosses can fire you, teachers can't. If you need the job, that can be a problem. \n\nAlso, kids can go through their parents to potentially get a teacher fired if they're unhappy with the teacher. You can't do that so much with bosses. Yeah, there's some recourse for workers, but it seems like it's simpler with teachers.\n\nI've had good bosses and bad bosses and good teachers and bad teachers, but it's usually been easier to deal with a bad teacher than a bad boss.",

            "Yeah, children talking about their struggles and people who are mistreating them are often underemphasized or treated like they're exaggerating or not important. Person listening might be thinking \"well my school year sucked but not that much so they're exaggerating\"",
            "It really depends. For some context as an older person, both bosses and teachers used to be far worse. My teachers straight up abused and bullied kids, stuff which would *never* be allowed nowadays in most areas. \n\nSimilarly, bosses used to be allowed to do all kinds of fucked up shit to employees, half of the time it was barely even legal but they did it anyways. I had one boss when I worked at a bar who was much, much more scary than any teacher I ever had in terms of verbal intimidation. I had another boss who ran a place like a factory overseer and overworked his employees constantly and would threaten to fire them for the slightest things. I had another boss who slept with all of his female employees, presumably a quid pro quo situation with them. Basic corruption and abuse like that used to be very, very commonplace with workplaces, and now is not anywhere near as common. By and large, people follow the rules, with a few exceptions. \n\nIts possible your teachers grew up that era and that is what they are thinking.",
            "Adults keep telling children that school is so much better than adult life, having a job and so on.\n\nWhat you mentioned is part of that.\n\nI strongly disagree. Teachers might or might not be better or worse than some bosses, YMMV, but the situation is completely different. Usually a teacher has much more power over you, and a larger possible impact on your future.",
            "I\u2019ve had a shitty boss before. Micromanaged the fk out of me. We butted heads so much and he didn\u2019t have empathy or manners. Definitely way worse than having a shitty teacher. You don\u2019t need to spend all 8 hours w/ your teacher.",

            "I've not had bosses worse than teachers but I have easily had five Co-workers worse than any teacher I ever had by FAR.",
            "You were unlucky with teachers but lucky with bosses. Not all bosses are terrible and not even the majority, or the world wouldn't function really. But they aren't uncommon either and if you have had more than 4 or 5 jobs I'd be surprised that you haven't encountered a bad boss yet. \n\n.\n\nBit off topic, but this reminded me of my early teachers telling us how we would need cursive for all our English assignments and papers in the future and all through HS and college and such. Except by the time I hit 4th grade, that was the last year they taught cursive to the younger kids (learn it in 2nd grade here) and then they stopped requiring it for assignments or anything. I never needed it once in HS - although it has caused a few issues at times in my adult life since I can hardly read it and can't write it at all cept for my name.",
            "I worked at a restaurant for a little while and the boss was awful. I quit but ended up working there again about 6 months later and the new boss was an absolute legend. So in my experience it doesn\u2019t even depend on the industry or place, it just depends on the person.",
            "sounds like an excuse teachers may have used to continue being shitty. \n\nand before i get roasted, teachers and educators should be paid better but there definitely bad teachers who do not belong in schools teaching youth.",
            "Anyone saying, \"Yeah i'm a piece of shit, but there are worse people!\" Are fully aware that they're a piece of shit and use it as an excuse to continue the behavior. \n\nBut on the other hand you are also decently lucky for having decent bosses. Bit of column A, bit of column B.",
            "I was blessed with (mostly) good teachers and good bosses.\n\nBut I'd much rather deal with a teacher than a boss at a manufacturing facility. If I f-ed up my school work, the only one I hurt was myself. If I f-ed up my work when I worked in manufacturing, I'd hurt myself plus my co-workers,  my boss and employer, and potentially even the ultimate customer of the product.",
            "That or maybe by lowering your expectations of bosses, they've passed with flying colours. But in general teachers are more strict with absolute authority while bosses know that employees have a general idea of what is legal and what isn't.",

            "All lies.  If a boss treated me half as badly as some teachers did I'd be quitting on the spot.",
            "Ultimately, a boss needs his workers and will try and cater to them within reason. A teacher doesn\u2019t need their students and generally doesn\u2019t value their input because they\u2019re just kids.",
            "I don\u2019t recall mean or rude teachers but I do recall teachers who play favorites and that\u2019s in the real world too (jobs).",
            "It was total BS, up there with threats of being things on your permanent record and classroom group projects being good practice for working with people in the workplace. \n\nAlso for many (most?) professions, school hours + homework > regular work hours, so for me that one has been bullshit too. (RIP medical workers though)",
            "I too have had really great bosses and I dropped out of high school so I think that says a lot about the education system.  \n\n\nWhen I went back to school to get my degree, I had amazing teachers there tho.",
            "You've been lucky as an adult. When you're a boss with employees you have legitimate power over people with consequences like their livelihood that you are in control of. There are a lot of people who power trip with that power. In school there isn't much \"actual\" power a teacher has over a student besides sending them home, which is usually something they want anyways.",
            "I've never had a co-worker or boss call me a nickname, but I sure had teachers who argued with me that it my name was jizzy, not jizzlevania. \n   \nIt's sounds like adults around you were minimizing your experience to excuse shitty behavior. Anytime I heard the comparison between school and work, it was how school work was easier adult work. No recess, sometimes still have homework...",
            "Case by case. Extra downsides in the case of teachers is that they\u2019re an adult and you\u2019re a child so it is even more cruel as children don\u2019t understand why some people are just assholes. As well as the fact that you have less choice when it comes to a shitty teacher. You can get stuck with that class and not have much say as a kid. As an adult you have the option to quit your job and find a new one though it can be a hassle.",
            "My manager at my first job was awful. She only scheduled my coworker for one day a week, 2 hour shift, because that was the minimum required and she was trying to get him to quit. Why was she trying to get him to quit? Because she didn't like him, but had no actual reason to fire him.",
            "I think that's a bit lucky tbh. Sure a bad teacher can mess with your future prospects, but a bad boss can put your life in danger or steal from you and a boss can have more control over u than any individual teacher.",
            "Uh, you're lucky as fuck.  Shit, I've had bosses that I could have easily landed in _prison_ if I hadn't been so afraid of them",
            "Both teachers and bosses can be absolute shit. Equally possible.",
            "Everything they told you is wrong about everything.\n\nEmbrace the world with your own perspective because the people who raised you are obviously incorrect about everything.",
            "I would say teachers exercise more direct control of you than bosses do. There is a more nuanced dynamic between a boss and employee but the power a teacher wields is (or at least seems to a child) more absolute.",
            "I never knew what to believe when I was in school. I had the now memed situation throughout high school of our teachers telling us \u201cthings will be harder in university.\u201d Or \u201cuniversity professors won\u2019t put up with this.\u201d Meanwhile I had university professors sending emails at 1am to cancel class because \u201cit\u2019s supposed to be a nice day, go outside and get some sun.\u201d Lol. I think it\u2019s a combination of teachers exaggerating  and you just being older and being able to cope with more bs than maybe you realize.",
            "I'd say OP has probably been lucky, BUT that the suffering that comes with a bad boss is usually worse than with a teacher because usually you have that teacher for just one year, whereas you can be stuck with a lame boss for a lot longer.",
            "If that expression came from teachers, it's probably because they were dealing with their own administrators, and it's pretty much a given that school administrators are just awful.",
            "Teachers are bosses. They are the same. The only difference is that you have like 15 teachers per year (some may repeat the next, some are new though). While you only have one boss per job. \n\nIf youre lucky you get the chill teacher, who instead became a boss. If youre unlucky you get the asshole teacher who instead became a boss. At school you have so many teachers that they are bound to have all kinds of them as teachers. \n\nThe only real difference is that teachers have to stay in limits bc your parents may complain, but bosses can do wht they want, bc you need food, which means you need money, which means you dont wanna lose the job by complaining about your boss to anyone where it has meaning to complain. Which makes bosses tend to be a little worse. Not a lot tho",

I'm not saying bosses don't do that but don't dismiss the childhood experiences of people because you think your bosses have been worse.",
            "My grade 7 teacher was this ancient Chinese lady who was more of a drill sergeant than a teacher. My favourite memory is this one time, actually quick backstory when she logged into the school computer her login was the first letter of her first name, first letter of her middle name, and then her last name. This spelled Atchoo. Well once my friend had a cold and kept sneezing and we were teasing him and fake sneezing and she came over and yelled (in an old chinese lady accent) ARE YOU MAKING FUN OF ME!!?????? As she thought we were making fun of her login name. Another time she made me call my mom on the school phone in front of the whole class and tell on myself for disrupting class. My mom was like um okay? I remember on the first day of school she lectured us on the appropriate way to write our names and date on each paper like in a specific way and place and for the entire year you would lose marks if you didn\u2019t have like a right side underlined name or whatever it was. Man good times",
            "If a boss hates you he fires you or you quit. When a teacher hates you your chance of going to college hangs in the balance. \n\nI had a teacher who routinely lost my and another student's assignments. We started taking pictures of us turning them into the tray. Suddenly no more missing assignments.",
            "I completely agree with you- got my first job at 15, am now close to 30. I have never had a boss worse than my worst 5 high school teachers. I have worked at swim pools, in education systems, in fast food, calling people on behalf of different fund-raisers, office environments and university admin. I have had bosses who were either lazy, or at least a little incompetent- but never any that were absolutely shit at their jobs or that I regretted working for. I have had teachers yell at me, impose arbitrary punishments for stupid things (I once got a detention because my notes made it look like I wasn't enjoying the class. I wasn't- bit I was getting great grades). I have had a teach explain to my mum that, \"I would like to say that there is an animosity between us, but I think it is more that your son often looks bored in my class and I really don't like that\". \n\nI will also say I don't think I ever had a single teacher that was better than any of my best 3 bosses for day to day working. I may not always be this lucky, but almost 15 years into working amdnI completely agree- my average boss is way better than my average teacher, my worst boss is still way better than my worst teachers, and my best teachers wouldn't even make my top 3 bosses. Luckily school is much shorter than the average career, and I get to spend more time working with the better end of things.",

Bosses that are too bad won't keep as many employees as a good boss (though bad bosses still exist ofc). It's the same thing as when teachers are like \"You think this is acceptable? Your teachers won't be so lenient in college. College is way worse than high school.\" and college turns out to be way more lax than high school.",

Of course we know that there are lenient, kind, and compassionate bosses out there, but we want you to get used to disappointment and facing the consequences of your actions when you encounter people who will give zero fucks about you.  If the teacher has cross the line into abuse, it is reprehensible.  However, as a teacher myself, I've often used this line with kids when they try to get away with avoiding the consequences for their actions.  \n\nConsider the circumstances under which a teacher would have said that to you:\n\n1. begging for extension on a deadline\n2. Trying to get a higher grade than the one you earned\n3. Trying to avoid detention or punishment for being late or skipping class\n4. Avoiding punishment for disrupting class\n5. Trying to get out of doing a missing assignment\n\napply those to the working world and under a less than reasonable boss, you could be fired for those kinds of things.  Because your teachers held you to a higher standard, you don't try to do those things as much as an adult.",
            "Depends on your culture I guess. Teachers and bosses are products of their upbringing and environment. If teachers aren't getting help from their workplace and parents then I can imagine that their mood will worsen with time. But generally I don't think anyone goes into the job of teaching (at least 18 years and younger) with the intent of not doing a good job. Life may have happened on the way and changed them however. It's also a mentally draining profession that requires you really to take a break now and again. Not saying other jobs don't have that, many do, but this is a job where burnout has been researched.\n\nThe bosses...I mean they are as varied as people are. Unlike teachers or nurses or other professions that require a sense of nurturing you won't find a common ground between a random set of bosses (besides maybe being middle aged and male).",

Until I advised him I'd be happy to replicate the pain on him to see if he'd tolerate it.  He STF up PDQ about me milking it after that.  Also would speed walk when we were walking to a client meeting together while I was hobbling.  Prod me constantly to 'not' get sea sick on a company boat outing.  Even after a previous late night and a very seldom cigar the previous night,  I didn't have issues thankfully.  God forbid had I told him my previous night activities as he would have ramped it up.  Finally I told the company owner I was sick of the bs and was switched to another manager.\n\nThe only time I quit due to a boss was after three months at another company with a company lifer crappy boss.

If he wanted to take credit he had to at least retype it all.  He had me write up the defense of a patent he wormed his way onto.  He wasn't competent enough to do it. Came in one day to yell at me for not work on what he yelled at me the day before for working on. Total shit show. HR even said they knew he was a problem when I quit.  I could go on and on.  I quit when I had figured out where to hide the body.  That was my clue to leave.\n\nAnother boss would immediately grab his cell phone and start yelling at people as soon as you brought an issue to his attention.  Never got the chance to point out that we have it resolved and I'm just FYI'ing him in case it comes up.  Stopped bring up things to him as it damaged my relationships with other departments.  I actually used it to get stuff done by other departments by saying \"I'm coming to you to let you this is going down, here is what we need done, and I'm talking to you now to avoid (PWE - Penis With Ears) from getting on the phone and yelling.\". I took another job in another department to get away.  But not before I brought it up to the big manager. Under a major reorg, all his people got taken away. Not a bad guy personally, just shit management skills.  Like really bad.\n\nAnother boss only knew how to manage using threats and intimidation.  It too me a good 6-8 months to figure out he was grossly incompetent.  He didn't know shit.  He knew when to say key words and tricky phrases about our department.  But he didn't actually KNOW what those meant or did.  So he had upper management buffaloed while we were constantly under the threat of \"we will have to look for someone else\".  Got the F out of there.  He caused 3 early retirements, and several of us to leave.  A total of about 75% of his department.\n\nDoesn't mean all bosses are bad. I've had some phenomenal bosses.

So supposedly they should be at least good at what they do and also be good people persons (not always, yes, I know). From this perspective, management track and teacher profession self-select different types of personality.\n\nI personally believe the market competition for talent forces businesses to evolve into places where managers are leaders, not stereotypical bosses from your quote.

I think how you position yourself and establish boundaries will play a much larger role in your relationships with your bosses than your relationships with teachers as a kid. If your boss texts you at 2AM and you reply willingly and understandingly, then by accepting your boss' behavior, you are setting yourself up to have that happen continuously and potentially get progressively worse. As a kid, unless it was absolutely unacceptable treatment, you just have to deal with it. As an adult, you do not.\n\nYou have the ability to establish a dynamic based on respect. If you have made that attempt and your boss still does not respect you, then unless you absolutely need the income and cannot get a job elsewhere, I would highly advise finding a different employer. Bad employer's certainly do exist, but in my experience, much of a bad manager's behavior impacts their direct reports most if the behavior is enabled. To be clear, a bad manager is not a reflection of the employees that work under them.\n\nAdditionally, there are some people who simply should not be working in a supervisory role. Those managers who try to abuse their power, treat employees like they are dirt, like making it rather difficult for employees to have a vacation request accepted while they go on vacation for 2+ weeks once a quarter, etc. These are the kind of people you do not want to work under. Find a new job (if possible), talk to your boss' boss, or do something to rectify that situation. Those people turn their best employees from A players to C players. At one point in time, your A players could and would do anything to ensure the organizations success, where now they do the bare minimum to not get fired while having minimal interaction with the organization. That is not what you want as a manager, and certainly not a situation you want to have to endure as an employee. If you find yourself in that situation, figure out something else.

            "In the past, yes, there were bosses that really sucked and their actions were considered 'normal'.\n\nHowever, 50+ years of employees suing their bosses for that shit has removed 90% of it.\n\nThese days it'll be rare to find a boss that bad and employees that have any self worth will simply quit and find a new job.",

You are extremely lucky, then again I guess you come from upper class and now have a posh job.\n\nLet us assume your teacher and your boss are the exact same grade of asshole.\n\nYou teacher:\n\n1. Has you 4-5 hours a week.\n1. Cannot affect your home or personal life.\n1. Cannot affect your life long term, except for you being a child and he can cause mental trauma if you dont have support from others. Most of your non-high-school grades dont matter a lot.\n\nYour boss:\n\n1. Has you 40 hours a week. Probably more, as bad bosses tend to overwork people.\n1. Can ruin your life financially. You depend on him to feed your family.\n1. Can ruin your self worth and mental well being way more than teachers can. He is with you 40+ hours  a week. He can torture you in ways a teacher can dream of. He can make your work difficult on purpose and then keep telling you how bad you are. Guess what, this is very common because incompetent bosses can end up doing this even if they dont want to be mean.\n1. Can have long term effect because he can give bad reviews to all your future employers.\n1. Bad bosses usually mean toxic work culture, which means your co-workers are also abusive.",
            "As others said, there are shit bosses, too.\n\nBut as an adult, you're not a hostage.  If they're bad enough, you find a way to change jobs.  \n\nBut remember, most school teachers are the ones who generally believe that school was the highlight of their lives.",
            "I can\u2019t think of one instance as a kid I gave any teacher a reason not to absolutely lose their shit on me. I\u2019ve had way worse managers than I ever did teachers.",
            "Sounds legit to me. 25 is not very old. The higher positions you get to in the workforce the more stress there can be and sometimes shitty, unreasonable bosses do have a tendency to rise to the top where no one really wants to speak out against them because they're too high up in the organization by that point and they're seen as \"important to the business\".\n\nWhereas a shitty boss at the lower levels has a lot of people overseeing them and monitoring them and if they're really terrible, people will just \"go over their head\" to their own boss to get them dealt with. So you may be insulated from some of these tyrants at the lower levels, or they may have already been eliminated from the organization or at least put in a non-managerial role.\n\nThere are definitely plenty of hostile, toxic, abusive bosses out there. Not as many as there once were, as tolerance for such behavior has reduced significantly in recent years/decades, but it's still definitely a problem that exists. If you've seen movies like \"Horrible Bosses\" or \"Office Space\" they're comedy and it's somewhat exaggerated for comic effect obviously, but it's comedy based on reality. Bosses can be that bad, they can actually be even worse in exceptional cases.\n\nAnd I think the worst bosses will absolutely be worse than the worst teachers, simply because bosses have even more power over you and your life, especially if you're relying on the paycheck to pay your bills.",
            "I've had some bad bosses,  but the difference is I'm able to tell them to kick rocks as I find other employment.  Can't really do that in primary school.",
            "So as a kid, most people don\u2019t give you respect/think you are blowing things out of proportion. They are dismissive. Your boss? If they say/do the wrong thing, boom, gone, fired. Bosses have to follow stricter rules if you know the rules. Teachers actually get dictate them.",
            "What they are actually saying is that all of their non-teacher peers have shit bosses.\n\nI would look at the difference being that boomers and their predecessors were generally shit bosses. If you're 25, you're actually pretty lucky that you may go your whole life without a fucking boomer boss. Having dealt with them most of my life, I can tell you that boomers are the worst fucking bosses you've ever had in your life, worse than anything.",
            "I've had both shitty bosses and shitty teachers. It's interesting how they attack you differently. For my bosses, it's more professional and sneaky. When they yell at me it's not yelling but stern talking in a professional tone. They say it in a way to place all the blame on you making you hate yourself instead of them.  For teachers, it's more straight screaming in front of other students about how stupid I was.",
            "I think I\u2019d probably frame this as, \u201cIf you think you have a bad teacher, wait till you have a bad boss.\u201d Because you can have good and bad of both, and most of the time it\u2019s the luck of the draw - but only one of them has control over your livelihood, and it\u2019s not the teacher.",
            "I think part of it is probably the impression they have on your life. I've had bosses far shittier than my 5th grade teacher but they don't stick out as much, because I was 10 years old in 5th grade and it was much more shocking to me how shit people could be.",

Why so?\n\nEdit: Thank you all for your answers, I\u2019m glad I now know how it works in different countries :D \n\n(I also generalised my entire country when I shouldn\u2019t have. I\u2019m only speaking about my own school and other schools I know. I\u2019m sorry, my bad!)\n\nEdit 2: Also how long were your lunch breaks? Mine was 50 min, but in High School it could be as long as 2 hours when we had no class.\n\nEdit 3: There are so many answers and I would like to thank all of you for sharing your stories and answers :) very interesting to read !\n\nEdit 4: I live in Belgium. I grew up in The Netherlands. In middle school (Netherlands), I used to eat home. Most kids would always eat at home.\n\nAt my high schoolschool (Belgium), we had two breaks: One 15min break (a snack break) and one 50 min break (but this could be longer).\n\nIt was \u201cthe norm\u201d for us to bring your own food to school or eat somewhere else (home or at a store). Our school did offer the option to order a sandwich (they didn\u2019t even make it, they would just order it somewhere else). The sandwiches were usually around \u20ac3. \n\nI would only buy one if I forgot my food or didn\u2019t have any time to make it though.\n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m surprised that other countries actually get (full) lunch at school or even hot meals.

I live in Tampa, FL, which was a big city even back then.  Grades 9-10 went from noon to 5 p.m.; grades 11-12 (last grades) were from 7 a.m. to noon.

Few students live within walking distance of the school, and in most families both parents work, so there's no one home to feed the child anyway. \n\nTraveling off campus for food is also impractical; places to buy food are widespread and usually placed on or near dangerous highways.\n\nPlus, with an on campus cafeteria schools can devote less time to lunch break, as there is no need to factor in traveling time.

Main line might be pizza or sandwich, veggie, fruit, and milk while \u00e0 la carte line you could pay an extra $0.50  for a cookie or second milk or churro, what have you.\n\nLow income families can, instead of the $1.25 normal lunch pay a reduced price of $0.40  for the whole meal and if you had no money in the account they still had to give you something (usually PB&J w/ milk).\n\nThe neat thing is that schools are a reliable source for food **at all times** meaning that during the pandemic while schools were completely closed kids could still show up, walk in, and get lunch.\n\nFor some kids and some families a school lunch was the _only_ reliable full meal they could get if parents are struggling.

            "American teacher here. Ive worked at schools in low income areas where students get breakfast, lunch and after school \u201csnack\u201d which was actually a full meal. The thinking was we didn\u2019t want hunger to cause kids to be unable to focus on their lessons. The negative side to that is I witnessed soooo much waste. For example, In order to keep our grants, every student had to take a breakfast plate. We had so many students just toss the food in the trash they would station food workers to intercept unopened milk cartons to reuse during lunch. Also because of the curriculum demands and size of the schools, some lunches are very short. The middle school where I worked we had to fit 1000 students in a two hour lunch window ( mandated by the district) so lunches were only 25 min. In high school we had 45 min (one class period). In the 1980s we could leave and come back but now (in most districts in my state) students are not allowed to leave for lunches (truancy issues). Also due to non compete rules vending machines must be shut off during lunches.\nI hoped that gives you some more insight.",

            "High school teacher here. This blends together all of my most-hated things about the American school system. \n\nLimited time, transportation issues, and lack of trust of children. \n\n\nAmerican kids only have 20-30 minutes for lunch (or even less sometimes!). We push pure academics instead of social development (and then wonder why kids are unhappy!), so lunch times have become shorter and shorter to accommodate more academics instead of \u201cfree time\u201d. Our communities are rarely walkable, and often schools are specifically set back from local businesses and neighborhoods where you could walk. Schools typically have sports fields and other things, (since we often lack community developments like that), and are set where there\u2019s affordable space, typically not in a walkable area. Since people think public transportation is for \u201cpoor people\u201d, there\u2019s rarely bus stops near a school (in the rare communities that even have public transit). School busses take kids to and from school, but it would be a nightmare to try and transport kids to surrounding businesses at lunchtime. \n\nProbably most importantly, we draw a hard distinction between kids and adults. Kids are not to be trusted, and they cannot be unsupervised in regular society. The lack of public transit reinforces this idea, you can\u2019t really go anywhere alone until you\u2019re able to drive (16 years old in most areas) and have a car, and the adult world is unfamiliar and \u201cdangerous\u201d for kids. It\u2019s incredibly rare to see adult-less children in any facet of adult life such as grocery stores (and then we wonder why they have trouble as adults). Because of this over-protective mindset, schools are responsible for the safety of students during school hours. Letting kids leave campus would be a HUGE liability for the school. I\u2019ve seen schools get sued because a kid left campus without permission, got injured, and the parents blame the school for not doing enough to prevent the kid from leaving. Kids are kept track of an accounted for every minute of the day. My attendance record is a legal document that can be brought into a court case\u2014-if I mark a kid present, I am legally responsible for their safety during that time period. \n\nThen we wonder why young people are always stressed and can\u2019t function in the adult world.",

I will say though, the quality of the school\u2019s food leaves a lot to be desired in the US (at least back then). I think most schools use Sodexo, Aramark or something similar.

            "Light takes a few seconds to cross the width of the sun: https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=width+of+the+sun+%2F+speed+of+light\n\nSo... we wouldn't see it TOTALLY flicker on and off, right? Because the light from the \"back end\" of the sun (I mean the part farther from us, like the edge of the disk instead of the center of the disk) would still be coming. Overall the light would just dip in intensity a bit, then return to normal. Or am I wrong on this?\n\nEDIT: https://i.imgur.com/A7tnaMn.png\n\nMore details and my attempt at an actual calculation here: https://old.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/cl5lcq/if_the_sun_blinked_out_of_existence_for_1_of_a/evtldy6/ Bottom line is, the light from the poles of the sun is (I think) delayed by about ~2.3 seconds in comparison to the center.\n\n> So once Earth notices it's no longer receiving light from the center of the sun (direct path), it will STILL have light that came from the edges. 2.326 seconds later, it will stop receiving light from the edges. But by that time, since the sun was only gone for 0.1 second, the light from the center has already come back.\n\n----\n\nBut, scientific instruments would probably detect the \"dip\". I guarantee there's hundreds of precisely-tuned instruments, some on Earth and some on satellites, watching the sun's intensity. A massive decrease in intensity like that, recorded by all the devices and occurring over the whole surface of the sun, would be wild",
            "If all of the matter that makes up the sun were to wink out of existence for a fraction of a second you would be left with a dense gas of photons that would begin expanding at the speed of light. These photons usually take thousands of years to reach the surface of the sun but they can now accomplish the same feat in a matter of seconds. This would greatly increase the amount of light being radiated from where the sun used to be. People on earth would experience an extremely bright flash of light that could potentially cause severe injuries especially for people operating dangerous machinery.",

Humans, through extreme means and plans, could survive for decades or centuries.  If the sun simply clicked off for .1 second, we would not be running a risk for any permanent drop in temperature and may not really even notice any change in temps at that moment.\n\nEarth's rotation around the sun is roughly 30km per second, so .1 second of no gravitational pull from the sun does not leave much time for Earth to spin out into the galaxy.  Any spinning further away from the sun in that .1 second timeframe would still leave us comfortably in the Goldilocks zone to sustain life and we may not even notice any detectable change in climate/temperature.",

            "What you are thinking about is the light essentially diffusing through many different mediums and holding some capacity to buffer out the momentary flicker. This is rational for something like a sound wave that travels slowly enough that echos from our environment can smooth out a fast fluctuation of a wave. So if you were playing a tone in a area with buildings and solid surfaces, you would not be as likely to notice the pause.\n\nPicture being  in a field with a sound source far off and to the side is a big brick wall that forms a 90\u00b0 angle between you and the sounds source. You're 343 meters away from the sound source and the brick wall is 188 meters away from both you and the sound source at a 90\u00b0 angle. If the sound source were to be generating a single tone and then were to stop for 0.1 of a second, you would not hear the tone cease. With sound traveling at 343m/s, in that 0.1s the 34.3 meter wave gap would be filled with the echo bouncing off the brick wall and then when the echoed tone pauses the sound source tone has already reached you. You would notice it in this situation but add more reflective surfaces all around you at different distances and increase the amplitude and you probably wouldn't. \n\nLight is sooo much faster than sound. Lights travels 300,000,000 m/s (3 million meters a second). In that momentary 0.1 pause in light, the gap would wrap around the Earth 7.5 times. So in the above scenario a 0.1 second light pulse would be almost immeasurably similar to the reflected pulse off the wall(from the environment). So if the source of light goes out and you don't have aglow pigment you're probably not far enough for any reflections to buffer out the pause. \n\nOf course you can match the luminosity and build some type of Dyson sphere that essentially makes the light travel a distance as to delay it 0.1s. So if there's a pause the reflection fills the gap and then the direct source resumes before the reflection pauses.  \n\nThe simple answer is you'd know. It'd be like it being night and suddenly day for a tenth of a second.",
            "By removing the sun, and as a result its gravitational effects upon other objects in the solar system, then rather than continuing to accelerate around a circular path, they will instead continue to travel in a straight line at a constant speed instead.\n\nThis might not seem like much, initially, but as every planet, comet, asteroid and spec of dust in orbit around the solar system would move independently of each other, their orbital paths would change once the sun resumed normal service.\n\n\nSome objects would travel closer to others, and others would travel further away. This would result in many objects finding themselves in unstable orbits where the slight increase in gravity between them could give them a slight kick, which over time could lead to objects being ejected from the solar system entirely, or tugged out of their orbits and into other objects and planets.\n\nOn a larger scale, the removal of the sun would also remove its protective magnetic field from around our solar system. This field, known as the heliosheath, protects us from a lot of radiation and particles from outside our solar system by deflecting them away from us.\n\nBy removing the heliosheath for a second, we'd be allowing all of this radiation into our solar system. Even at the speed of light, this radiation wouldn't travel far, after all it takes around 8 minutes for light to reach us from the sun, and the outer limits of our heliosphere appear to be around 84 times further away, but once restored, the suns magnetic field would be far less able to safely deflect all of that radiation away from us, and much more radiation could potentially reach us.\n\n\nThis radiation would lead to some very interesting aurora in the atmosphere, and the interaction with Earths own magnetic field could cause problems for orbiting satellites and ground based electrical grids, much like solar flares do today.",

            "I looked only briefly, but I did not find the correct answer - I apologize of it is hidden down there and I am just repeating. If the while Sun blinked at once, at its location (not due to a barrier between us and it), it would look very unexpectedly. Due to finite light speed, the center of the disc, which is the closest point to us would blink first and then we would see an expanding ring of darkness - first broader and slower, later narrow and fast. The radius of the Sun is roughly 2.5 light seconds, so in first approximation that is jow long it would take. At any moment, for a 0.1 s blink only 4 per cent of the disc would be dark and a 4 per cent dip in solar brightness is not visually noticeable. The ring of darkness would however be just about wide enough to be visible through a dark protective glass without a telescope.\n\nIf you wonder how the hell does something like that happen in the nature and why we don't see it, it's just because the premise is unphysical. An object will never undergo changes faster than the light time to cross it - the changes would have to be pre-planned across the object, which the nature kinda doesn't do. We do, however, observe weird effects of light propagation in astrophysical sources, especially if yhe geometry is favourable (something moving almost but jot quite towards us at high fractions of light speed).\n\nSource: am astrophysicist, do deal specifically with stuff that moves very fast.",

About 0.1s later, the sun would be back and we'd go back to orbiting it from our new position slightly further away than before. If gravity moves at the same speed as light, then we'd notice both effects at about the same time (~8 min after it happened).\n\nNobody's ever turned gravity off and back on before, so I don't know if the Earth would experience it as a sudden jerk or a gradual pull.

We only have real sensation of the area around the anus, which tells you it\u2019s time to go poop as stool collects in the rectum.\nWhen you don\u2019t poop after this initial feeling, there is a fascinating occurrence of reverse peristalsis within the rectum which is independently regulated by the enteric nervous system. This is your body\u2019s way of helping you not poop when it\u2019s a bad time. \n\nThere\u2019s also a cool way that the rectum \u201csamples\u201d the consistency of the stool in it, which allows you to discern whether you are about to let out a fart, or you need to run to the bathroom.\n\nEdit: Fell asleep and this blew up, thanks for the gold kind stranger!

Laxatives like miralax, or the like, are osmotics... they draw water into your bowel to help flush out what's in there. You should try to use the bathroom when you have the opportunity,  it's much healthier and minimizes complications like hemorrhoids.

            "In terms of scale, a similar problem with gifts comes to mind: say someone gives you a great marble statue. Fantastic gift, but where are you going to put it? In those days land wasn't in nearly as high demand as it is now, and we've pretty much seized up the limit on usable land - we aren't getting more anytime soon.\n\nYou get given a great big monument, where will you put it? It can't just *go somewhere* either, it typically needs a place to be at and a decent area around it to separate it off from everything else and allow people to see it. Think about DC, if you've been there, or feel like looking at a map: plenty of the monuments there have lots of extra open space or accompanying features.\n\nIf we were to be given another Statue of Liberty, I don't know where the hell it could even go that would be a deserving spot for it *and* isn't taken up by something else.

So I would just say, \"It's [my mom]'s daughter.\" And then if they went, \"Ohh, hello [wrong name]!\" I wouldn't have to say my name, but I'd dread someone saying, \"Oh, X's daughter, what's your name again?\"    \n\nIf you're wondering how the hell I got into this unrealistic predicament, it happened because as a kid I was too timid to correct people who called me the wrong name.

There are others with my name, but we are few and far between. Whenever I am at a fast food place or have to give my name to someone over the phone, I immediately say it as loud as I can without being obnoxious (so they hear me), and spell it for them. People still get it wrong. It's mainly the last letter, which is an \"R\", that people mistake for an \"N\", so I really stress the \"R\". It takes people a few attempts to pronounce it correctly, even more to remember it. It is frustrating because it is a part of my identity and my family's legacy, but I feel like people unconsciously judge me because of it since it isn't a \"John\" kind of normal name. Also it is super awkward when people try to get it right, but keep failing and I keep repeating it to them like we don't speak the same language or something. \n\nI am American (White male), and my name sounds like someone who died in the Civil War, fighting for the Confederacy.

I have thought about legally changing it, but I am the last male born with my father's last(maiden?)name so, there's that to contend with. \n\nIt is exhausting having to correct people with my name in casual conversation. People look at me like I'm an asshole when I do this, so most of the time I just let them mispronounce it just so I don't have to deal with it. \n\nHaving a unique name is kind of cool, and when people finally understand it, they are like \"OMG WHUT A KEWL NAME!\" But for me, the cons out weigh the pros quite a bit. \n\nMy last name is both funny and sad.

            "Tldr: because mentally the difference between being 21 and 33 is not as big as you thought it was when you were 21.\n\nPeople physically age as the years go by, of course, and for younger people the differences in appearance make the 'older generations' something _different_ from themselves. It's hard to imagine that someone that looks clearly different is still essentially the same person that they have always been. (Nb 'younger' and 'older' relatively speaking, of course.)\n\nIf someone is 22, it's easy for them to look at being 32 as being just as far off into the future as 12 is into the past. But that's not true. Life experience matters, but people don't change in same way they used to as teenagers.\n\nSomething that blew my mind was reading the book 'Other Minds' (ostensibly about octopuses, but covering lots of things). In it, the author made the point that there's nothing intrinsically biologically necessary about growing (physically) old. We tend to think of age as being the body literally just wearing out through use, but that's not why the body ages. For any animal that reproduces at age x, any random mutation that affects that animal before age x to the point of reducing its chance of reproducing also reduces the chance of that mutation being passed on. If a mutation kills an animal before age x, then the mutation won't be passed on. \n\nBut _any_mutation that only affects the animal after age x, will be passed on to its offspring. Those mutations will tend to spread, without anything to keep them in check. And more mutations will likewise develop, and more. Mutations including serious disorders, as well as things like aging skin, or greying hair. If those mutations hadn't occurred, people might still have the bodies they had in their twenties, even into their nineties or beyond. I'm curious how people would see 'old age' if that were the case.",
            "at one point honestly when i was 18 for some time i felt like much older mentally. like a proper grandpa. than remembered i was actually 18. this REALLY put into perspective for me it all.\n\nold is a mindset.  \n\n\nall the people even the youngest you know, that just got born. they ll get to those ages eventually so why stress about it. might as well try to be the one who handled it the best.",

            "I'm 43 and I've been on the tom brady plan. I mountain biked my whole life but after mellowing out a lot after high school, i started to get back in to it more seriously around 2001. Every year I set it up more and more. Compared to where I was in the mid 2000s, and especially where I was in the mid 90s, I'm an absolute animal. Some day I suppose I physically won't be able to keep getting better but that day is not here yet. \n\nAnd when it comes to just over all physical \"feel\", I've long since cut out all sugary beverages out of my diet and that alone changes everything. As a teen I used to drag my ass around the house. Without the sugar, now I can run around all the time. I never feel sick randomly, I highly recommend ditching all sugar drinks. \n\nI've also been lucky that I've had no real joint issues or anything like that. Any MTB injuries I get still heal pretty quick. So all in all yes I feel like I'm 21, except when I was 21 I felt like I was 31. But when I was 31 I felt like I was 24. \n\nIf we're forgetting the physical and only talking about mentally... I've had a few setbacks in life and they've kind of left me stuck in the same place I was when I was 21, which is very discouraging. So mentally I feel like I'm still 21 but in ways I wish I didn't.",

            "In the past, there were significant cultural milestones that signaled a transition in behavior to how we conceive \u201colder\u201d people to be. For many reasons, we don\u2019t actually see or perform that transition anymore. We don\u2019t generally have multigenerational homes. We can\u2019t really buy a house. It never really feels secure - everything from economy, to politics, to increased mental health issues, to global warming all keep us in that state of unsureness. And most of us didn\u2019t have a model for what a patriarch should really look like - we either saw our grandparents and the disconnect our parents had with them, the abusive side of the toxic elements of it, or both. Gen X for the most part rejected those kinds of boxes. In a sense, there isn\u2019t a way to feel older anymore because we don\u2019t know what that looks like; we\u2019ve just seen some rare cultural artifacts of people \u2018acting\u2019 older.

            "Because you can\u2019t accept the fact that you are slowly aging to reach a point where you are old and decrepit. It\u2019s to your benefit. Because if you thought hey I\u2019m now 33 and not 21, you would start to realize things you used to be able to do and can no longer do. Then you would start thinking you are old, when in fact you are still capable of doing everything you could ten years ago. And until you\u2019re over 85, that\u2019s how it will be. 21 was also the last birthday that felt like it meant something, now it\u2019s just trying to forget what the number is because the numbers don\u2019t mean anything anymore, except that you are getting older. Go out and do a hobby from your youth, I promise you won\u2019t break a hip. Stop wasting your time worrying about age and deal with health conditions when they arise. Be happy for living this long, not everyone does. Now again, go do a hobby from your youth, like biking or basketball or soccer, etc and stfu",

            "62 this year and I pretty much feel the same as I always did. Still think of myself as basically in my early 20s, but a whole lot smarter.\n\nThey say that you never feel yourself growing older, but the cops keep getting younger. Same with dental surgeons I guess. I swear the kid was like 12 and his assistant was maybe 14. How the hell does this work? Haha\n\nThe other thing I notice is how dumb people have gotten. They don't seem to know anything about anything useful. I thought I was pretty smart in my 20s. Delusion seems to work in all directions.",

Crazy thing is I physically feel 26, body still looks mid 20s, and I  sometimes feel my maturity level is around 26..bad thing is, females that are into me range in average from 21-35..females my age or close are not into me at all",
