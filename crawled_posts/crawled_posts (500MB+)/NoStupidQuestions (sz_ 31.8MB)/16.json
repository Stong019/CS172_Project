        "selftext": "I bought a $1000+ sex doll which weighs almost 100 pounds and has a metal skeleton and silicone outside. It's like 5'3 and looks very realistic.\n\nI bought it when I was drunk like 2 years ago and didn't cancel the order the next day as I forgot I even ordered it; it showed up on my doorstep like 10 days later in a huge box... I tried to use it once but it is impossible to use because its so cold lol. I have it buried under clothes that I don't wear anymore in my walk-in closet for almost 2 years and every time I have a girl over I have to keep the closet locked and I even have to tell my cleaner to clean all rooms aside from my walk-in closet as I am embarrassed by it.\n\nI NEVER litter but I don't know what to do with it. I really want to put it in the back of my truck and dump it in the woods somewhere but I know that is a shit thing to do and will not do it.\n\nHow can I dispose of it in a environmentally safe way without driving to a dump and looking like I am disposing of a dead body or having the workers laugh at me? I can't cut it up into pieces and put it into trash bags as the skeleton is metal and I just don't have the tools to do it; its a really legit sex doll it is super high quality.\n\nMy apartment complex has a huge dumpster but its all on camera; should I just go there super late at night and throw it in there? The dumpster is on camera and its for \"trash only\" it says no metal and no boxes.\n\nAnyone have an answer on how to dispose of this thing by myself, quietly and without anyone seeing me?\n\nThanks !!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Lots of weirdos getting angry at me because I \"fabricated this\" story/question. She just got a (SFW) photo shoot for you so shut up. [https://ibb.co/album/xKkCs1](https://ibb.co/album/xKkCs1)",

            "The \"separation phrase\" comes from a letter Jefferson wrote to a group of baptists in Danbury, Connecticut. The actual status of religion as it relates to the US government, as seen in the Constitution and Court decisions is actually a tolerance for religion. Which is very much unlike the separation the French and Russian revolutions sought for their country, which was the extermination. America tends to expect religion to play a part in its public life, although it does not prescribe a mode of religion. The French and Russian revolutions had to contend with serious state churches, while the American revolution was fought, if not explicitly, implicitly with a backdrop of religious toleration. The English Church had problems with Nonconformists such as the Baptists and Puritans who did come to America for the promise of religious toleration, and later the Methodists which was growing during the American Revolution",
            "Separation of church and state doesn't mean that everyone in the government has to be an atheist. It just means that the government can't tell anyone what religion to follow, and religious leaders don't have political power (unless they get elected to a government office).",

            "Read the First Amendment. Separation of church and state means no official state religion. The phrase they used was \"an establishment of religion\". It doesn't mean elected officials are not allowed to believe in a religion. In fact, freedom of religion is protected by the same amendment.",
            "Not allowing it would be a more egregious breach than allowing it.",
            "The separation of church and state means the USA won't have an official religion, like Great Britain has the Church of England.",
            "Separation of church and state is a concept, not a law.\n\nWhat is a law, is that the US Governments cannot have an official church, nor can they force you to go to church or a specific church.  The Church, of any kind, can't be a part of the government.",

There is no law stating that you have to swear on anything. You could just swear",
            "I think a better approach to your question is \"why is it so common?\" Because America was started as a Puritan colony and the spread of religion is still existent today. In many states (the midwest, the south) the religious (especially Christian) population outnumbers almost everything else. So when they created the oath of office, and the first amendment of the constitution emphasized that the government can not discriminate against any religion, people quickly chose the article or text that they find holy and important; the Bible. Separation of church and state, as many people point out, mostly means that the church does not have any influence over the laws and governing bodies of this country. Whether that's actually true in today's government is... questionable. It's especially doubtful when people have a [fit](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/feb/20/viral-image/ilhan-omar-didnt-break-law-when-she-used-quran-tak/) over people swearing on items other than the Bible, such as the [Quran](https://theworld.org/stories/2019-01-03/two-reps-are-being-sworn-quran-it-s-symbolic-moment-muslim-americans). But the Bible is not a requirement; this would be a blatant breaking of the 1st amendment.",

Swearing on a bible doesn't establish an official religion of America, and therefore it's not prohibited.   \n\n\nEverything that is prohibited (like praying schools, nativity scenes on public land, etc.,) is based on a misunderstanding of the prohibition, activism, and/or stupidity.  \n\n\nWe're supposed to have freedom OF religion, not freedom FROM.",

These are just customs developed over the years.",
            "Personal freedom.  Requiring it would be a violation, leaving it as an option isn't.",
            "To be clear, there is no separation of church and state listed anywhere in the constitution or the Declaration of Independence. The idea of church and state being separate was stated in a letter from Thomas Jefferson on his interpretation of the 2st amendment which states the federal government could not establish an official religion. Before the constitution several colonies were established with a certain religion. The framers of the constitution did not want the federal government to do the same. It was not until the 14th amendment that the establishment clause was added and therefore officially stating the government cannot be affiliated with any religion. However, the United States was founded on Judeso-Christian values, so the common practice is to swear on the Bible.

This idea comes from Sir Edward Coke in England where he challenged the authority of the King and believed that the power of the Church and the government should not be intertwined. \n\nReligious people can still openly talk about their beliefs and create legislation about it, just cannot force people to join a specific religion.

            "To be honest, I think it\u2019s about some weird sense of ownership \u2013 almost like a tribe mentality that\u2019s gone off the rails into something dark. And that can sometimes get tied in with a depressing sense of inferiority that\u2019s been placed on black people for centuries. \n\nFor reference, I\u2019m a black woman who\u2019s married to a white man. Before we were together, I mostly dated white guys. \n\nIn my experience, the only people who\u2019ve ever had a problem with that have fallen into two categories: racist white people who think I\u2019m garbage and want me to stay with \u201cmy kind\u201d instead of bringing down my partner\u2019s station in life (as an in-law so eloquently stated to me once). Or racist black people who think I\u2019m acting like I think I\u2019m \u201ctoo good\u201d for black men. \n\nOf the latter, I find it\u2019s often black guys but it\u2019s also some black women. I think their explanations for it come from a really dark and depressing place that reflects the history of race in America. I\u2019ve had some tell me I should only be with black men because so many white people already see black people as less desirable. So that in my choosing to be with someone else, I\u2019m discriminating against my own people. \n\nAnother argument I\u2019ve heard is that white men have historically taken advantage of others and often in the form of forced marriage or sexual assault with women of other cultures. I had some jerk who was trying to pick me up at a bar tell me I was making a mistake by allowing a white man to \u201cclaim\u201d me. That gross interaction has stayed with me all this time later because I sat there looking a brother in the eyes and having him degrade me like that just because I wasn\u2019t going to sleep with him.\n\nThe whole idea doesn\u2019t make sense. But from what I can understand, the people who are loudest about this have some really rough feelings about race and have internalized them instead of trying to work out their own prejudices and enlightening themselves. It\u2019s sort of like a racism towards white people that internalized into a devaluing of self. If that makes sense. \n \nThese are such sad ways to look at life. Because it just creates more prejudice and implies that as black women, we\u2019re still not free to make our own choices. Only in this context, it\u2019s \u201cour people\u201d trying to own us.\n\nEdit: Wow! Thanks so much for the upvotes and lovely Reddit awards. I\u2019m shocked. I usually just use this account to wander into threads about weird tv shows and a lot of other hilarious nonsense. I never expected anything I wrote in here to earn so much positive attention, let alone gold or platinum! You guys are the best! \n\nI also wanted to add something very important to my original post: \n\nFor the record, I am in no way saying that I find black men inferior or that I believe all black men will mistreat their partners and families. If you read this that way, I\u2019d recommend reading it again. People are people. Some are terrible, many are not.\n\nFor examples of black men working against some nasty and unfair stereotypes, I don\u2019t have to look any further than the men in my family or friend group to see examples of that everyday. They\u2019re some of the kindest, most caring guys I know and treat their partners, families, and the world around them with the respect everyone deserves. \n\nHad my husband been black (or Asian, or Hispanic, or Native, or anything other than European in ancestry) I\u2019d still love him just as much and I\u2019d have still chosen to marry him. It just so happens that this man I love, am most compatible with, and that I\u2019m choosing to live my life with is white. And that shouldn\u2019t be the focus, but sadly for too many people, it has been. What I\u2019m trying to say is that we all deserve to be loved and respected equally. So let\u2019s remember that.",

Obviously this isn\u2019t always the case, but I think the guys who get upset over black women dating white men are subconsciously or consciously viewing the whole situation as a racial competition among men. They think when a black guy dates a white girl he\u2019s overcoming centuries of history, but if the roles are reversed it\u2019s just white domination continuing. \n\nAgain, I really really really don\u2019t believe in that kind of thought.

I'm just trying to find the truth. \n\n\nBlack people really, really care about race. It is a huge part of their identity, possibly even the dominant factor. I could be wrong. My black friends feel the need to tell me that they prefer or date white women. Some of them say it \"matter-of-factly.\" Some of them say it with a tone as to communicate that they want me to know that they are fucking my women. That's not how I see this situation. White women are not mine. It's the tone that gives me this impression, almost as if to stick it to me for being white, when I could not care less who you fuck. Being black has a lot of cultural and historical baggage, namely slavery and socio-economic inequality in the US. So, I could see why some black men may use this tone.  Maybe they experienced racism or their parents did. Maybe they feel a certain way about white people, and are looking for justice, albeit in the wrong way. Also, women are sometimes seen as a conquest or \"property\" to men in general. I don't see women this way, but I acknowledge that some men do. So, when a black man says that they have sex with white women, with a certain tone, it gives me the impression that they want me to know that they are taking my women, and they want a reaction out of me . . . and/or it gives them the satisfaction of taking my women. \n\n\nWhen a black man sees you with a white man, they feel like white men are taking you from the black community.

A lot of black people even though it didn't happen to them personally or even anyone in there family in the last century the point still remains of \"settling old scores\". Dating white women and having them birth their children is pretty much a form of \"sticking it to the white man\", not saying all black men or even I feel this way but that was generally the consensus. \n\nNow when a black women dates a white man the idea is pretty much \"it's treason then\". You're going against the plan and should only be dating strong dark skinned brothers because of course, the ppl who ever heard of sexual preference only heard of it from their point of view and not from a woman's. They have a warped sense of pride and protection when it comes to black women and a sister dating anyone of any race outside of her own is then labeled as \"Ignorant\". I've heard it countless times from other black men, \"how can she stomach dating a white man? That sister must be lost. She must not know her own history if she's willing to lay down with the devil\".

It's the same thing as height and various other physical qualities. It's especially keen for men I think partly because of overall, encouraged as \"masculine\" qualities like jealousy and possessiveness, and societal pressures which can also disqualify you (lack of wealth, charisma, status)...\n\nSpeaking as a white guy who has dated a black (Somali) girl before, I never really ran into much prejudice from her friends (her religious family was a different matter) because being entirely honest, as a white guy socially I'm seen as an advantageous match, I have that white privilege. [Public Enemy sang about this from a black perspective decades ago.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHn9uActymI) \n\nThat is slowly changing however with the widespread acceptance of people of colour in the mainstream, which is of course a good thing. What would once have gotten you lynched (looking at a white woman) is now almost the expected standard of relationships; a black boyfriend is considered an achievement. It's turned up as a Family Guy joke many times as I recall, in particular when Lois calls Bonny to excitedly brag that Peter is now classed as Black. And certainly in the UK, almost all the children I see these days are mixed parentage, much as it enrages the racists.\n\nSadly there is still residual racism towards black women, as the standard for female beauty is still seen as mostly white. But we can hope that changes given more time.\n\nSo does it make me hypocritical when I've looked at white women with black men and feel a bit annoyed? Of course... but I quickly remind myself it's coming from either being single or jealous or both: As long as they're happy together, it's really not any further concern of mine.\n\nHowever you can't really argue with hormones, so there's always that initial \"lucky bastard\" response all the same.",

You could see it in her eyes, if she wasn\u2019t in love with that man she was on her way. And from his body language and the way he kept the conversation going back and forth (neither one seemed to spend an overt amount of time talking instead of conversating), I could tell he probably felt the same. \n\nAnd I sat there for my entire dinner and thought how awesome it is that these two found each other. Because I honestly can\u2019t think of how these two people, who are so opposite of each other, would manage to bump into each and spark that fire.

Whereas, if a white female were to be involved with a black male, slave or otherwise, it was completely frowned upon.  Due to this, much like chauvinism, it has become a hand-me-down belief. I am a black man who has dated many different races, and taken much flak for it from many different races as well.

I would think that due to the shortage, black women would need to branch outside of their race in order for all of them to find a mate and black men shouldn\u2019t begrudge them of that.",

She doesn't give a fuck, unless she is a bigot. A lot of men see a woman of their race dating someone of another race ? Shitstorm is coming. Why ? Because it is a property thing. Women must remain available for men of their own ethnicity / community so the community can go on, and they are tainted if they have relationships with men from other communities, but men can bring whoever they want into the community since they are \"conquerors\" and can force women to blend in their social group through sex/rape and mariage (think about how systematical rapes on women are used to destroy social links within a same group during war and especially civil wars). \n\nBefore anyone gets red in the face reading this, this isn't a feminist statement but a social and anthropological observation which does know a few counter examples (Jews and Mosuo) but yet is still the most widespread system among societies.",

Because of Americas historical racism they think that \"taking white women\" is a way to degrade/devalue white men as some kind of revenge fantasy. \n\nWhereas is essentially the opposite when its a black woman and a white man. Now the situation is seen as a white person diluting black culture and black men lose that sense of alpha/superiority.\n\nThe same can be said within most traditional asian cultures as well. A lot of families want their children to marry a specific ethnicity of asian so it can represent either them moving up in society or see it as them controlling someone from more powerful country or a country that had fought with their homeland in the past.\n\nIts a really fucking weird and archaic way of looking at the world in the modern/progressive scope of 2019",

I briefly dated a black girl in collegel a long time ago (late '80s).  We clicked and that was that.  Her parents were not happy with our dating.  They weren't overtly mean about it, so we kept on going.  Living near Pittsburgh, PA, I remember we went to the annual arts festival and we were walking hand in hand.  A black (I'm saying black for context.  I'm not a fan of describing anyone's race if it's not necessary in the story) woman walked past us and starting yelling at my girlfriend because I wasn't black.  Not because of that, but since we lived far apart (90 miles), we broke up soon after.  I was broke at the time and couldn't make it work.  \n\nI say all of that to say, I don't think no matter who you are in the US (I can't speak for other countries, assuming you live in the US), if someone is in an interracial relationship, someone is going to make a big deal about it... probably it'll be worse in other parts of the country than others, of course.

It\u2019s hard for him to find black women to date outside of the church. He would tell me white women were never really interested in dating him, as a black man. They were more interested in, (his words), getting some \u201cJungle dick\u201d. They want the experience of a black guy but don\u2019t want to date them or really be seen dating them. \n\nThis was further backed up for me when talking to many girls. Some female friends of mine would talk about how they\u2019ve been with black guys but weren\u2019t interested in dating them. Some would openly say \u201cblack men are gross\u201d... others would just note that \u201call black men are too aggressive\u201d. I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve ever dated a black man so I only have their experiences to work from. \n\nI\u2019m an especially ugly guy, so several years ago I had a profile without a pic. The number 1 question I got asked was \u201care you black?\u201d, always followed by \u201cI don\u2019t date black guys\u201d. It wasn\u2019t universal but it was common. They would have less of a problem with ugly dudes than black guys. \n\nSo, with all that, I\u2019ll answer your question the best I can. It\u2019s really hard for black men to date. The dating world is possibly the worst for them of all groups. Often, the only girls who will date them are black, so if a black woman is dating a white guy, it\u2019s one less guy in the dating pool for them or their black friends."

            "I live in The Netherlands so I have not really an idea about the cause for this in the USA, but for my country the situation is the same, people in their 20-40's are not able to buy a home, over here it is caused by investors who buy houses as an investment, rent them out and making money while the people who rent the homes cannot save money.\n\nAnother cause of the problem is that there are not enough houses for the population. During the financial crisis projects where cancelled and many of the workforce lost their job, whole company's went bankrupt, causing a lasting shortage of people with the skills to build houses.\n\nNext cause is the fact that our government invented a special Tax for organizations who build houses for the lower class. So these organizations are bleeding and have no funds to either renovate their old houses or build new ones.\n\nAlso a few of these organizations (Vesta) went almost bankrupt as a result of fraud. To prevent their bankruptcy they had to sell a large part of their affordable houses, to, see point one, investors.\n\nAnd las t but not least, the so called gentrification of the poorer parts of large cities. Older small but affordable houses are demolished to build larger but more expensive apartments forcing a \"poor out, rich in\" effect.\n\nHousing our people was (and should be) a right, but we sold it to the \"market\" \n\nThanks Mark",

            "A few different factors-\n\nInflation means you can't just compare the nominal dollar amount. $1 in 1992 is equivalent to $1.94 today.\n\nHousing, in particular for in demand areas, has gotten more expensive relative to other things. There's a lot more demand for places like cities, but supply has been relatively stagnant due to restrictions in building (stuff like zoning). We used to build a lot more housing that kept up with demand and population growth. Now, a lot of places have zoning restrictions for things like single family housing. When you have more people wanting to live in that same space, prices go up. Existing homeowners tend to fight new housing - restricting housing means the houses they already own go up in value more, and they tend to be afraid of changing the feel of their community.\n\n\n\n\nLabor has captured less growth from productivity than in the past. That means in the past, maybe a company makes $10, and labor got $5 of that. Now, it'd be less, maybe say $3. (numbers in this line for example)",
            "Don't forget the part that interest rates play in all of this.  Borrowing money today is almost free compared to your parents time.  In 1990, the interest rates were 9.75 to 12.95.  While there house cost less, they paid a great deal of interest. About $378,000. (Standard 30 year mortgage) If they borrowed the same amount at today's rates, they would have paid $89K in interest.\n\nThe price of housing will come down when interest rates go up.  Of course, there are loads of negatives about rising interest rates, but it will impact housing. The folks that can afford a $1 Million place today at 2.75, cannot when the rates to 5% or 6%.",

            "There's 2 major problems:\n\n1) Job growth has been concentrated in some cities and stagnant in much of the country.  You can easily afford a home in Detroit, St. Louis, or rural Mississippi, but there are no good paying jobs there.  In Boston, SF, and now trickling down to other cities like Salt Lake and Austin, job growth is leading to housing demand that is outpacing housing growth.\n\n2) The 2008 housing market crash triggered banks to become more stingy in lending.  This led to a slowdown in housing growth, so now we have a 6 million home deficit.  With rising construction costs and limited land, it's going to be hard to quickly build that many homes.\\*\n\nAdd to that the low interest rates the past few years and housing demand far outpaces supply, especially in growing cities.\n\n\\*https://www.forbes.com/sites/graisondangor/2021/06/16/the-housing-shortage-is-worse-than-ever-and-will-take-a-decade-of-record-construction-to-fix-new-reports-say/?sh=3ee3557d4953",
            "5 factors according to economists:\n\n1. Cost of maintaining homes have been going up since the 70s. This is because of regulation banning slumlords. Because the cost is so high, rent needs to increase to maintain properties \n\n2. No new technology has been introduced to make building homes more affordable. Despite vast technological improvements in nearly every field, construction hasn\u2019t changed much. Construction crews don\u2019t really have incentives to improve upon the process because it would reduce their billable hours.\n\n3. Truly terrible regulation. Governments often put limits on the type of buildings permissible in a neighborhood and their maximum occupancy. It\u2019s not uncommon for them to also require new homes to have x number of parking spaces for every few residents. A parking space is 180sq ft. That becomes burdensome fast\n\n4. Homeowners tend to act like cartels and will often prevent new housing, so they can maintain the spirit of their neighborhood while also preserving their homes\u2019 values\n\n5. Investment is high. We need 3.8 million homes to keep up with demand. That\u2019s not happening anytime soon. A lot of this demand comes from investors. \n\nTHE SOLUTION: as a proud liberal, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m going to say this, we need significantly less regulation.  Zoning laws should be significantly relaxed and homeowners should lose authority to lobby against new developments. On a technological level, we need to find better and faster ways to build homes. Setting up wooden scaffolds with un-interchangeable parts, like dry wall, is no longer efficient enough. Homes need to be factory produced with interchangeable parts. There are a few companies doing this, but not nearly enough to meet demand.\n\nFrankly, I have little faith that housing will go down. The factors that are causing it to go up are not easily changeable and not even money can solve it. This really requires both political and technological breakthroughs. That\u2019s not happening anytime soon",

            "The most prominent reasons are wage stagnation, real estate as investment, and existing homeowner incentive to increase housing prices.  \n\nWages have had very minimal increases while profits have soared in the past decades. If higher minimum wage were to pass, the upward pressure for more skilled workers would raise wages across the board. Anybody incentivized to maximize profit has reason to try to prevent that.  \n\nReal estate as investment has led to major investment companies buying properties at a remarkable pace for the purpose of either renting at inflated prices or flipping at a profit. Reduced housing supply means higher prices.  \n\nFinally, existing owners both individual and corporate benefit from these high prices and want to keep \"the poors\" away. It's a little easier to vote for a sketchy politician when their vote protected your million dollar house from losing half of its value when they prevented a homeless shelter being built a block away but instead put it on the edge of town.  \n\nIn short, insufficiently regulated capitalist markets did this. Adequate protections from housing price gouging would have helped, but the people who drive prices up have louder voices and more resources.",

All of California, Seattle, New York, Boston and most of MA, a few others. \n\nThere is insanely cheap housing in Topeka, Kansas, Quincy, Illinois. Wages are low, yes, but not that much lower than in cities, and housing is maybe half or a quarter of what it is in expensive cities. It's just not a pleasant place to live. Lots of meth, poverty, racism, bad schools.\n\nI went to college in a small depressed train town where you can buy a 4 bed 2 bath mansion for 90k. But you better bring your job with you, because most of what's available is jobs at Wal-Mart. \n\nSo the answer is:\n\n1. Wages haven't kept up with inflation\n\n2. Housing has gone up everywhere, but has skyrocketed like crazy in certain markets. \n\n3. Your parents probably paid next to nothing for college. My dad took out a $500 loan to get through. I worked full time in college and got a huge scholarship and was lucky to get out with 25k in debt. \n\n4. Boomers lived through the best economic period in US history, and thought it was the new normal. Before that, people lived in poverty all the time. People rented their whole lives, struggled to eat, were under-educated, who were subsistence farmers. \n\n5. That's the other thing. Farms are no longer a way to make a living. The way to make money is to live in a big city, so housing has gone up a ton in cities. \n\nHopefully the pandemic will even things out.

With her first paycheck as a teacher she bought a brand new imported car.  \n\n\nThe Baby Boomer generation is considered the richest generation in existence as after WWII and the onset of the Cold War the social economic support was constant around the whole so called Western World. The Marshall Plan after WWII created the whole boomer economy. This was done because of learning from lessons from the first World War.

            "Several things. First, if they bought a house for $200K in 1992 they were probably doing pretty well. Let's say they were earning $X. Well, if you earn $X today you would actually be earning much less than they were in constant dollars.\n\nThe price of an asset is determined by a lot of things but one determinant is the cost of capital. If capital is cheap, prices go up. The cost of capital for houses (mortgages) was steady at around 5 or 6% for decades, shot up in the 1980s (my first mortgage was over 18%) and has been falling ever since. For the past 10 years or so, interest rates have been held at all time lows.\n\nBecause interest rates have been more or less falling for 30 years, house prices have been more or less rising for 30 years.

            "It's important to look at the flow of the house price as much as the stock.  \n\nIf say a house is 400k and the interest you pay on it is 5% that's a 384 a week. At 2.5% it's going to be half at 192. \n\n Now let's say we will take 30 years to pay both off. That's 256 a week for the 400k one.  (384+256=640) so our net outgoing a week is 640 and we can pay that.  \n\nBut lets say the person is ok spending out of there wages about the same either way. So when the interest rate drops they can take that money they might have spent on interest and put it into principal. Which ends up being around 575k for the house. (278+371=649)\nThe weekly cost hasnt changed to the owner. \n\nSince most people think in terms of more immediate cash flow this is an important factor in why prices can go up even if your cash level doesn't.  \n\nAnother good example is the total stock of rent you might spend over a similar period.  Say you pay $280 a week because that's what the interest on the 575k house is.  That's still 430k you have spent purely on rent.  \n\nThere are other factors like speculation and my calculations are super basic but it's a quick way of showing why lower rates can increase the price of homes as a whole even with stagnant wages and possibly because of stagnant wages.\n\n That increased borrowing against income leverage up the economy and puts new money into people's hand that they spend.\n\n The issue is as cash flow becomes king the ability to buy capital becomes saving constrained. If you don't own something or have sufficient savings you get priced out by the cost of entry. 20% of 575k is more then 400k even though the actual cost doesn't change. So people that got on the ladder during high rates end up pulling further ahead. \nIt does make it harder to unwound as well since if you do increase rates you reduce cash flow and spending which can be recessionary.",

            "No Taxation Without Representation' is a great slogan for a revolutionary... but it's not actually the law in the US.\n\nIn the 18th century, American colonists felt alienated from Britain because they did not have a seat in Parliament and so had no say in the governing of their own territory - and taxes (along with the 'Intolerable Acts') were the easiest, most hated examples of British domination. But when the rebels won and created their own government, they didn't let everyone vote - not even all white men! It took [until 1856](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_voting_rights_in_the_United_States) before all states allowed (white) men to vote *without* being landowners, and women didn't win the vote until 1920! The fight for voting rights continued throughout the century, with Asians only able to vote in 1952 and some Native Americans denied the right to vote until as late as 1970. Even today, convicted felons lose the right to vote in some states. And in fact, the nation's *capital* is taxed without representation - Washington, D.C. gets no Senators and only one non-voting member in the House of Representatives! It's such a sticking point for them that [their license plates complain about it](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/Washington%2C_D.C._license_plate%2C_2017.png). \n\nAt the end of the day, the argument by the government has always been that the *states* need representation, not the *people*. As long as some people in each state get representation in Congress, the system is fair and working...even if that seems unfair to the people who pay taxes but can't vote.\n\nEDIT: Added in some minority groups as well.",

We knew that some people would have a problem with labeling colors but it helped us in so many ways. To this day, they both love \"their colors\" the best.\n\nBut I digress. They are identical twins, but because one was being crushed by the other they don't look \"exactly\" the same. There are tiny things that only us parents notice and we know who is who. \n\nNow it would be next to impossible except that one has a different tonal frequency to his voice and I can tell who is who just by them talking.

            "It probably depends on the twins. I\u2019m 100% certain because of a substantial weight difference (1.5lb). For the first few months most people pegged them as fraternal because of the weight gap\u2019s impact (face roundness, etc). I actually lost a bet with my wife over it when the genetic test results came back.\n\nAs they\u2019ve gotten bigger it\u2019s gotten much harder, because the gap (still 1.5lb) is smaller in relative terms. You can still tell them apart by subtle differences and mannerisms, if you spend substantial time with them.\n\nOne has a birthmark as a \u201cbackup\u201d indicator, but we\u2019ve never needed it.",
            "Am a fraternal twin. He's a man I'm a woman. Still occasionally get called his name or one of the pets when my mom is looking right at me.",
            "Not parent but twin kid here, me and my brother both had different colour bracelets so that they could identify us. They were permanent ones which weren't removed until we were a few years old, so no I don't think we were mixed up.",
            "When my twin and I were babies, just like 2 or 3 weeks old, we used to switch clothes just to fuck with our parents.",
            "I feel my twin girls were more distinguishable as babies than toddlers. And at least back then they stayed where you put them.\nNow as toddlers I am 100% team color coded twins. Lefty gets blue/yellow/green stuff and Righty pink/purple/red. Without it I dont know who I'm yelling at.",
            "Yes I\u2019m sure, but we joke about it all the time.  My boys are very identical (mirror image identicals actually), but when they were born there was a major size discrepancy between them so that made it easy for the first few months. Once they started to even out in size we got them medical bracelets with their names on them and they wore those until they were four.   I used to have to check those bracelets multiple times a day to see who I was dealing with, had it not been for those two factors there\u2019s no way I\u2019d be certain right now.",
            "Twin mom checking in. I had two names picked out. The nurses asked before birth, I told them. One twin was going to have some problems in life, the other appeared to be good. Both boys. My names were bishop(the overseer) and Brooklyn(a tough city). Well my thought was bishop would watch over his tough little brother. \n\nThe nurses just gave my kids whichever name they felt. I was in bed and couldn\u2019t get to the NICU before my family who didn\u2019t know the names saw them. The damage was done. Brooklyn really watches over his bishop. They are two now.",
            "Reminds me of this:\n\n**Has anyone tattooed their identical twins to tell them apart?**\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/466xvo/has_anyone_tattooed_their_identical_twins_to_tell/\n\nTL;DR parents questions if they should tattoo one of their twins so medication is not given to the wrong twin.",
            "I\u2019m a twin and have often wondered this exact thing.",
            "I have a follow-up \"stupid question\". Did it matter if you reversed the names accidentally?",
            "Yep. The tattoo was a lifesaver.",
            "Twins have different fingerprints as fingerprints are formed by fluid flow in the amneotic fluid and not by genetics. Just fingerprint your babies and you\u2019ll have a record. \n\nAlso your clone would have different prints that you.",

            "Not a parent but a younger sibling to twins. When they were babies, one had a birth mark on top of their head. As they grew hair, we got them mixed up. We now know the one we\u2019ve always called Joye is not Joye but Emilee because she has a birth mark on her head",
            "Not a parent, but the twin here. My father told me that before my birth, we had a preset names. The bigger one would be named one name  the smaller one another. After we were born, however my mother decided that nope, she wants it the opposite way around. So I got what my brother should have been named, and he got what I should have been named.",
            "My brother and I are adopted and are 2 years apart. My mom still gets calls us by the wrong name even after 25 years.",
            "My kids aren't twins and I still can't get their names right",
            "Married to a twin, us wives can tell them apart but some friends have issues, doctors always have issues... especially when they're in uniform. We know for a fact that their names got switched twice, so they have their original names back but for a while they were swapped. My twin was born with a heart defect, the swap was caught at a check up when there suddenly was no defect, and the doctor sent the other twin for imaging, turns out they had been swapped at some point.",
            "Well now I have some questions for my parents. Thanks for the identity crisis!",
            "Being a twin, I sure hope my parents got our names right. My sister Christopher makes fun of my name Jessica a lot, though.\n\n\n\nIn all seriousness, I do have a twin sister tho, names changed to protect the possibly innocent"

            "r/NewToReddit is a place you can read advice about how to use reddit and ask questions about it.",
            "If people are mean to you, ignore them. Also, a subreddit is like a little community with posts related to the topic.",
            "If you are using the Reddit app on your phone or tablet, you should see a little swoopy arrow beneath someone\u2019s comment that you can tap on. Tapping on it should bring up your keyboard and you should see \u201creplying to u/nenenene\u201d for example. This is how you can type a reply in direct response to other people\u2019s comments. They\u2019ll get a notification that someone responded to their comment, making it easy for conversations to continue.\n\nYou can join subreddits by clicking the \u201c+join\u201d button if you\u2019re on the main page for that subreddit - I\u2019ll list some subreddits you might be interested in joining down below, and you\u2019ll see what I mean (hopefully!)\n\nYou don\u2019t have to join any subreddits but if you do, your Reddit homepage (aka \u2018feed,\u2019 aka that thing that scrolls forever) is guaranteed to show recent posts from those subs, so it\u2019s easy to stay involved.\n\nTerms you might see other redditors using:\n\n- OP: this usually refers to \u201coriginal poster,\u201d as in the person who made the post - so here, you\u2019re the OP! (When talking about videogames, OP usually means \u201coverpowered,\u201d so there\u2019s one to surprise the grandson with.)\n\n- Repost: this means that a meme or video has been posted a lot already by others. (People like to complain about reposts, but for every repost, there\u2019s someone who hasn\u2019t seen it yet.)\n\n- Karma: fake internet points accumulated by other people hitting the \u2018upvote\u2019 arrow on posts and comments that they like. Some people call \u2018upvotes\u2019 \u2018updoots.\u2019\n\n- Subbed: this means joined/subscribed to a subreddit.\n\n- Cake day: the birthday of a reddit account, so, today is your very first cake day! You\u2019ll see it as a little teal cake icon next to a username. (Some people think it\u2019s blue cheese, those people are silly.) It\u2019s generally good karma to tell someone happy cake day if no one else has already.\n\nIf you want to edit a comment you made, you should see a little pencil or crayon symbol beneath your comment.\n\nIf you want to delete a comment you made by mistake, click on the \u2018...\u2019 and the option should come up to delete.\n\nNow for some subreddits you might want to join - you can click on the links to go to the main page for that subreddit. (If you\u2019re on the Reddit app, you can try swiping to the right to come back to this page easily.)\n\nr/aww\n\nr/OldSchoolCool\n\nr/crochet\n\nr/knitting\n\nr/quilting\n\nr/gardening\n\nr/Wholesomememes\n\nI\u2019m subbed to these, so if you join, we might bump into each other in the comments. As I\u2019m sure you\u2019re figuring out, there\u2019s subreddits for everything, r/cats, r/dogs, r/squirrels, etc. (Some have goofy names - like r/superbowl, that\u2019s probably not what you\u2019d think of at first.) (The r/ part shows it\u2019s a subreddit. Similarly, u/ means username. If you type out someone\u2019s username exactly as it\u2019s spelled with u/ in front, it\u2019ll notify them that you mentioned them.)\n\nI recommend steering clear of the comment sections on politics/news posts, things get unnecessarily vicious. There\u2019s also trolls, or people who act up or deliberately say dumb things for attention, so \u201cdon\u2019t feed the trolls.\u201d (I still do it by accident sometimes.)\n\nI didn\u2019t mean to turn this into a whole crash course on Reddit, but I\u2019m all for cool grandmas. If you\u2019ve got any more questions or want some more suggestions for subreddits to join, I\u2019m happy to help!",

            "For many years the main way to interact with other people on the internet was through forums. These were websites set up, usually specialising in particular topics (IT support, programming, cars, dogs etc). Users would register an account, then you would either reply to others in an existing discussion (a thread), or start a new one.\n\nReddit is that, but rather focussing on one topic, it has many topics called **subreddits** (or \"subs\") all in one website, all tied to your same user account. Some are general communities, like news, politics, NoStupidQuestions; while others centre on one particular game, TV show, website. A forum thread is called a post, and everyone one else comments in response to that post (or other comments).\n\nEvery post and comment can be upvoted or downvoted by using the up and down arrows next it. Your total amount of upvotes is called your \"karma\". You can also be given certain awards by other users as a show of appreciation. They don't do a whole lot other than make you feel good, and they cost real-world money to buy. You can be upvoted or downvoted by any other users for any reason, or no reason at all. Don't put much thought into it, don't feel bad if you get downvoted and can't figure out why. Being downvoted doesn't necessarily mean you're unpopular, or incorrect, or have done anything wrong, and the opposite is true for being upvoted. They're imaginary internet points.\n\nThe subreddits are created by regular users. The **moderators** are users who are appointed by the subreddit owner to maintain order. **Admins** (administrators) are Reddit employees who have much more power but don't generally manage the day-to-day operations of subreddits.\n\nMost subreddits have rules about what content can be posted, mostly these rules are in place to keep things civil and discussion on-topic. Sometimes the rules don't make sense or will appear to be arbitrarily enforced, but keep in mind moderators are volunteers, and have to deal with idiots constantly. And generally if a rule is there, it's because it's something that has caused trouble in the past. Like the AutoModerator bot said, even though this sub is called No Stupid Questions there are still rules, you can see them on the right side of the page.\n\nAs a user, you can choose to subscribe to a subreddit, so it will show on your personalised front page. But usually you don't need to do so in order to participate in that sub. If you're looking for a particular topic that interests you, there is even a sub for that: r/findareddit.\n\nBecause Reddit has such a large user base and provides for discussion almost any topic, it is generally considered a Social Media platform like FaceBook or Twitter, but supports users having anonymity. Like any form of social media, there are cliques, politics, bots (both good and nefarious), misinformation, trolls, crackpots, scammers. Feel free to engage with, ignore or block/report them at your leisure.",

Could be force of habit but I find the \"old.reddit.com\" version easier to use.\n\nMore general advice: don't learn your grandkids' usernames or stalk them. If they're kids, especially teens, they're using reddit to explore their interests, figure out their identities, and develop relationships with similar people. I'm a teacher, and I think that teens need some privacy to develop (the number and nature of things I've pretended not to hear over the years would astonish you). \n\nYes, there are bad corners of this site, and bad people on it, but unless you have reason to believe he's becoming a neo-Nazi heroin addict because of his reddit habits, there's no need to follow him around unless he asks you to.

Other people look at them and comment, argue or make jokes.\n\nSometimes, like you just now, they are typing and starting or joining a conversation.\n\nThings to watch out for:\n\nNot everyone on here is nice or telling the truth\nSome people, often called trolls, are here to upset people and cause problems\nSome people are here to be obscene\n\nBUT\n\nYou can avoid all this really easily.\n\nIf you find a sub-reddit you like the look of.

            "Welcome to reddit.\n\nThis place is toxic and everyone is mad at each other pretty much all of the time in a lot of places on this site.  \n\nAlso, there is some pretty messed up stuff that gets posted here occasionally so watch out for things tagged NSFW or NSFL.  NSFW generally means porn.  NSFL (not safe for life) generally means really messed up porn, animal abuse, gore, or someone doing something that makes you question the human condition. \n\nThe anonymous nature of the site makes it difficult to remember the human at the other end.\n\nBut, it's not all bad.  There are subreddits (r/nostupidquestions r/pics are examples of subreddits) that cover innocuous hobbies, memes, sources of information.  Overall the worst parts of the site revolve around politics, but if you stick to the moderate political subs or the echo chamber that you agree with it's generally better (r/politics has a heavy left bias, r/conservative has a heavy right bias, r/moderatepolitics is usually okay for anyone, but with the current instability theres a lot of bickering).  Also, if you go on political subs, everyone is assumed to be an American unless you go to a country specific sub like r/ireland.\n\nIf someone is rude to you, don't take it personal.  It's not the worst place on the internet and there's a lot of good content here.  The rules for subs are generally posted on the right side of the comments section and they change from sub to sub.

            "All persons, I feel, have a shot at redemption. I\u2019m not religious, I\u2019m philosophical. We\u2019re human, we make mistakes. We can learn from past mistakes. I feel we need to look at ourselves to understand what to offer others. I know I\u2019m not perfect. I know I\u2019ve worked hard to change, and have. I know I\u2019m a better person than I used to be. I know this is possible because i have lived experience to prove that fact. I\u2019ve seen it in others. I can offer you understanding, compassion, and a faith in finding your own redemption. I think people have it in their power to do that for each other. It makes the world a better place to give people a chance to do better.\n\nWhat I can also say is, when we hurt people, that pain remains. Forgiveness can alleviate it a little, but the pain endures. It may fade with time and be largely forgotten, but if you go dig it up, that pain still hurts, fresh and raw as the first day. And we have to live with knowing we caused that for someone; or that we experienced it from someone. That\u2019s part of being a human.\n\nWe can regret. It doesn\u2019t feel good, but it\u2019s human. And we can go forward in life trying to lead a life that no longer incurs regret. \n\nPoint is, I\u2019m half Polish and Nazis killed my family en masse. I\u2019m glad you left behind white supremacy, it\u2019s not a healthy belief system.

Good is a construct of human design, the intent of which means \"for or towards improvement\". In the context of one's contributions to society, being \"good\" just means \"for or towards the improvement of society\".\n\nYour guilt and your self-loathing are subjective because you feel like everything you *have* done is still a defining part of your current state.

Build the equation thus:\n\nGood (for society) = Working for/toward improvement (for society).\n\nIf \"You\" = Working for/toward improvement (for society), then \"You\" ***must*** also = Good.\n\nRedeeming = Moving in opposition to past self in \"Good\" way\n\nIf \"You\" = Moving in opposition to past self in \"Good\" way, then \"You\" ***must*** also = Redeeming.\n\nGuilt and shame are powerful motivators, but they are explicitly devoted to the Past-Self, to the Not-Current-You in the same way that those things for which you feel guilt and shame are part of the Not-Current-You. You are not who you were a decade ago. Hell, you are not who you were yesterday, because \"are\" is a *present* deterministic. Is that pedantic? Hell yes it is, but  sometimes emotions are so strong and deep-seated that they *need* this level of ridiculous technicality to remind us that they are Not Objective, Not Fact.\n\nIt is technically correct to say, \"You did those bad things.\" It is ***more correct*** to say \"My past self, who is only a percentage of my current self, did those bad things.\" Because Current-You does not equal Past-You. Current-You = (Past-You) + (Experience). That is logically, objectively different, and a *vital* distinction if you are trying to find any measure of joy in the present.\n\nYou are good. You are making redemptive choices. Based on the definitions used by the society you inhabit, these are facts.

I think you can look around at the complex web of relationships that you are in and see what your impact is in that context.

We say that a person who has done bad things and grows to do better things is considered in much higher esteem than the person who has always just done right. It takes far more self-reflection and work, but that doesn't really cover it all. The reality is, most people who have never fallen have just had a better circumstance than those who did.\n\nThus, a person who has done bad things but has made a teshuvah (changed their actions for good) is more trustworthy since they have already been in the circumstances that give rise to the negative behaviors, have learned from those circumstances first hand, and are now resistant to those repeated circumstances.\n\nYou understand the ideology, you understand how it takes hold of people. You were used by it, and yes, by being one of those people are held accountable for the negative actions you have taken. However, if you truly grow in a permanent manner and change your actions, you would have to truly have come to an understanding of those actions that someone who wasn't in your shoes lacks.

            "I actually have two banks. One is open until 1 on Saturdays. Not every single branch of theirs is but several are that are with a few miles of me. \n\nMy second bank is a credit union and they have live ATM where you can talk and do your transactions with a teller through an ATM until 7 pm and they also have a few branches that are open half days on Saturday.\n\nI feel like most banks do have some options for weekend or after hour services, it's just not at every single location but they try to spread it out so that there's one near you. Now I do live in a big city with a lot of suburbs, so I could see how that wouldn't be an option in a very rural area.",
            "I remember before ATMs.  Bank hours M-F 9:00-5:00. Sometimes 1/2 day on Saturday. You literally had to stand in the line to conduct any form of transaction. Cash or check, withdraw money, etc. if you didn\u2019t have cash on a Sunday there was no place to get it. Many stores didn\u2019t even take credit cards.  \n\nAnd no direct deposit. you had to Spend an hour or so waiting in line to cash a check.",
            "I work at a bank.  While we do have normal checking and savings accounts, our primary focus is business banking. We don't offer mortgages or car loans. For us, staying open extra hours would primarily be an expense that doesn't provide much benefit.\n\nAround the corner is the credit union where I do my personal banking. Their business model focuses on individuals, so they're open until 6 most days. They also have Saturday hours at multiple locations. \n\nFor the most part, having tellers available is handy for people, but not critical to the average transaction. Most teller transactions can be handled through the ATM. Usually, things that the ATM can't handle are things that are worth taking time off from work, such as getting a home loan, or processing a large wire transfer. \n\nIn addition, there are things going on in the background that may not appear obvious...for example, if the bank is FDIC insured, then they must *strictly* comply with regulations. This may mean getting approvals from multiple executives (who definitely don't work weekends), or placing something on a hold until the corresponding bank can reply in kind. And most of the tools used by the banking industry are created/managed far away from the bank itself...there's a whole industry of companies that provide backbone services to banks. Some make credit cards, some manage the card transactions, some even provide the cash float that the bank works with from day to day. If what you want to do at the bank requires the attention or intervention from one of these agencies, it will have to wait for the work week, anyway.\n\nAlso, most of the employees in a given bank have families, and want to spend personal time with them. Just like everyone else, we have baseball tournaments and ballet recitals to attend on Saturday.",
            "I used to work at a bank.  As you stated, they were open from 9-5 Monday through Friday and from 9-1 on Saturdays.  A lot of customers would get mad about this, but they had other options.  You could deposit your paycheck through an app on your phone instead of coming to the bank. You could deposit your check at the atm. You could withdraw up to $2000 from the atms at a time.  You can send money to someone through zelle. \n\n A lot of the customers were apprehensive and refused to try it until covid hit. When everything else was closed, we were still open through the drive up only, which caused massive lines.  People eventually got tied off waiting on lines and decided to try the \"new\" or alternative ways of banking.  When everything opened back up, many of our customers continued to use the new ways because they were more convenient than trying to race to get to the bank before they closed. They realized that their checks took the same amount of time to clear too, which was something a lot of customers worried about.\n\n\nEdit to add: Another issue with being open on the weekends is that transactions won't post on weekends or when the federal reserve is closed.",

It's annoying that this business only operates during normal business hours.\n\nBut they are a business.\n\nOperating at normal business hours.\n\nThis is far from unique to banks. Operating while other businesses are operating is good for logistics, every business needs to work with other businesses to stay afloat, so everyone is open at the same time. Result is, everyone works a 9/5 and it's difficult to get access to many services.\n\nSucks, but the alternative is being unable to coordinate with other companies who are ALSO only open during that time.",

They are always looking for new ways to keep their customers happy and attract new customers.\n\nThe reason is quite simple, they take the money you put in your checking account and they lend it to others.

You will not only get 1 $35 fee for the purchase that put you in the negative but you will get a $35 fee for each of those other 3 charges that you HAD THE MONEY FOR if they end up clearing before you get paid.\n\nI had many occasions where I was put $100-$200 into the negative before my next deposit came due to this system of robbery, and usually it was over less then a $5 overcharge.\n\nThey are criminals. Wells Fargo was caught laundering money for the cartels or a cartel. What happened? They got a fine. A fine that was certainly less then the illegal profit they made.\n\nOh what else did they do? They pulled a nation wide scam and set up fake accounts in your name to boost their numbers with barely a slap on the wrist aside from embarrassment.",

Then im like bored if i dont have any tasks like calling or processing left. This saturday i also worked, I had only 3 people in my office. So people dont like to do insurances and opening bank account or do other bank related things in the evening and in the weekend. They want to chill , cook their food and watch Netflix.

So the person working was just doing nothing, that is not efficient. Moreover it was also shady because people became drunk or you have those annoying children, so you feel more unsafe in the bank.

I first noticed stores opening on Sundays in the early 90s, and the move to 40 working hours in the early 2000's.
