If you cannot differentiate between biological sex and sociological gender then that is your own language issue and we wish you luck with it.\n\n- Denial of identity is a form of bigotry and will not be tolerate, nor is it particularly relevant to this topic, if you cannot help yourself from going out of your way to be shitty to be vulnerable groups please let us know.\n\nIf you believe that now or in the future you will have trouble with not participating in denial of identity or other bigoted methods of spreading hatred feel free to message us in mod mail.\n\nYou are also welcome to message in mod mail if you have other questions.\n\nTo those participating in good faith we apologize for the lock but we will not be a platform for hate as expressed by users not participating in good faith.\n\nEdit: I don\u2019t respond to chats about moderation. If you saw the locked post and felt the urge to send your opinion on transgender people to me privately please reflect on whatever drives you to do so.",
            "Because men are seen as a (generalized) threat to women and not the other way around.",
            "Generally?  I think it's that transmen are just thought of as masculine or \"butch\" women. Women like that have been around forever and are not considered threatening.",
            "I wonder if it's also that men just don't care. \n\nIf a guy goes into a girls' bathroom, you get all sorts of shrieks and comments. \n\nIf a girl goes into a guys' bathroom, they just don't seem to care.",
            "The same people making this noise believe men and male sexuality are inherently predatory. So they believe a transwoman (who to them is still a man) in a woman's space is dangerous, but a transman (to them, still a woman) in a man's space is not.",
            "1) Trans men tend to totally, completely become Male without anyone giving them a second glance - they become and are \"typically masculine\", period.\n\n2) Cisgender males (generally) are unconcerned about trans males using male restrooms;\n\n3) Cisgender males don't consider trans males to \"be a threat\" in any sense;\n\n4) Nobody expresses any concern about trans males \"molesting children or women\"",
            "Looking at two issues that are commonly talked about:\n\nBathrooms and changing rooms: men generally aren\u2019t going to feel threatened by the presence of a FTM trans person. \n\nSport: FTM trans people can\u2019t compete in men\u2019s sport at a high level so it\u2019s a non issue.",
            "I used to bring this up when the bathroom issue got really big. The only child I have is a son. The male predators they're all worried about have always had access to my son.",
            "There is a lot of hostility aimed at trans men (including violence and outright hate) which gets swept under the carpet or reframed to be about other groups. \n\nHate aimed at trans men can sometimes be the more subtle, insidious sort, the sort allowed to fly under the radar or that rarely gets called out for the vileness it is -  rather than overt \"pitchforks and slurs\" type hate. Erasure and invisibility are part of the problems many trans men face.\n\nFor example, most of the \"debate\" I've seen around allowing access to medical transition has been about young trans men, but transphobic media reports it as being about \"teen girls\". The fact that they're men is scrubbed out entirely. Trans men are typically more often painted by transphobes as \"tragic victims who need to be saved\" rather than portrayed as predators. Most of the \"trender\" scaremongering,  most of the push to prevent access to means of medically transitioning, and almost all of the debates I've seen about legal parenthood status I've seen has been about trans men and transmasc people.\n\nThe cases of high profile transphobes calling anyone who menstruates women, or the drama about less overtly feminine sanitary products, or to rephrase certain maternity related phrases to accommodate expectant parents who aren't mothers was *specifically targeting and/or misgendering trans men and transmasc NB people*, as while it can be implied they don't think people who don't menstruate could be women (etc), in the cases I can think of, that wasn't what was said - but I get the impression that far fewer people ever actually stick up for or openly support trans men.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the awards and replies! I feel like the thread locked comment having a message of support for trans women, but not trans men is a prime example of the issue I was talking about in my last sentence (before the edit). Even when directly discussing the sort of transphobia trans men face, it's rare for anyone to say \"trans men are men\" or similar positive sentiments towards half the trans community.",

            "depends on who's doing the discourse tbh? i'm a trans man and have been out for over 13 years. it ebbs and flows with different targets. within the trans community there are a lot of spaces where trans women are almost never considered or included, which is a big problem. outside of the community, where people try to target us, trans women typically get the brunt of it for being more visible and due to misogyny, homophobia, etc. \n\nright now we're going through a massive uptick of transphobia and the trans community being in the public eye much more than we typically have been. those of us within the community have seen the target on our backs for a while, and known that we would be the next culture war issue while people circled around us trying to find an angle. they tried a few things! school bathrooms got a few bites several years ago but largely fizzled out. healthcare didn't work because everyone got distracted by how bad our healthcare system is in general in the usa. youth sports had some false starts and then really started catching on. for a while it was \"ROGD\" and \"the transgender craze stealing our daughters\"\u2014that one is still popular, and dangerous, and targets young trans men specifically. unfortunately it's just a lot easier to get one of these hate campaigns to take off when your target is easily identified and doesn't require any real understanding of anything to target, which is why trans women receive the brunt of it so often. to the outsider, who doesn't understand trans issues and doesn't want to, they don't have to worry about learning 200 different things and getting deep into the transphobic brain worms of the hardcore transphobes. all they've gotta do is have a hazy idea of a \"man in a dress\" who is unfamiliar and unattractive to them, easily identified, and can therefore be feared and hated. rinse, repeat.",
            "Common sense tells us that a woman becoming a man is generally not a threat- psychically, sexually, or in any other way. It\u2019s seen as \u201cwhatever- you do you\u201d and no one cares much. A man becoming a woman is seen as a potential threat- sexually, physically, athletically, etc. It\u2019s also seen as more creepy and suspect.  Also, a woman becoming a man is less noticeable, whereas men becoming women are easier to spot and just more obvious.",
            "Penis tends to cause more problems for vagina than vice versa",
            "Obviously because women are more vulnerable than men are. No one is worried about trans men in sports because their performance output is starting at a level below that of men, on the other hand trans women are starting at a level above that of women as one example of many.",
            "Because a cis women is more likely to be a victim of anything generally than a cis man",
            "Because society views women as being the weaker sex. This is something that has been taught to us historically and even today, that perception is still enforced (including by non-misogynists). \n\nSo the debate around transwomen is to protect what we view as the weaker sex. It's seen as potentially predatory when it comes to women's spaces and that you've started with a much greater physical advantage when it comes to things like sports. The segregation of sexes is largely to protect women and give them their own opportunities rather than protecting or giving advantages to men. \n\nTransmen however, for lack of a better term \"have to prove themself\". If a transman wants to play on the men's team, they have to demonstrate ability which is viewed as having been \"earned\" - you've worked to get to this level instead of just using an advantage that nature gives you. If you want to put yourself in men's spaces then you clearly feel comfortable and confident enough to do so. You've \"overcome your vulnerabilities\" for lack of better phrasing.",
            "Biological women are almost never a physical threat to biological men. That's why.",
            "For the same reason gay men, especially femme presenting ones, are what the homophobic discourse centers around as opposed to lesbian women. For a man to \"lower\" himself to an effeminate position is (in the homophobic pathology) a extreme violation and subversion. While a woman taking ona more masculine role is only \"elevating\" herself in the gender hierarchy. \n\nLikewise trans women threaten the cismale gender hierarchy in a way that trans men dont. To them someone transitioning to be a man is sort of logical because men are \"better\". A \"man\" becoming a woman though threatens male dominance because it implies that being male is not always universally more desirable than being female.",

            "I once had a best friend who was a trans woman. They told me they were transitioning and I was fine with it. But I just never felt comfortable with them entering a woman's bathroom. They had no physical features of a woman yet, nor dress or act like a woman. I have difficulty understanding because it just felt so wrong to me. How can someone who looks like a man, acts like a man, and dresses like a man enter the womens bathroom?",
            "trans men are infantilized and therefore not seen as a threat. most see us as butch, women pretending to be men, or at best \"soft boys\". \n\nwhen people DO talk about us in trans discourse it's almost always \"these poor girls have been brainwashed into hating their womanhood and femininity, we must save them from the evil jaws of transgenderism!\" \n\nbut those talking points aren't as catchy and fear mongering as painting the picture of big burly men in wigs forcing their way into women's bathrooms to sexually harass cis women. \n\narguably as well, trans women pose a threat to cis men who find it threatening to see masculinity transformed into femininity. or it's a threat to their masculinity to be attracted to a trans woman and therefore seen as gay. when cis men see trans men they see women in boy clothes, which is something to laugh at not to fear. \n\nthis is why I always say I owe my everything to trans women. they face the brunt of all hate towards trans people and carry the weight of the movement on their shoulders. they represent us and fight for us when trans men go unseen and unheard. they are some of the most at risk minorities in the public eye and they are aware of that at all times and still find the courage to be who they are in the face of it all. trans women are truly some of the strongest people on earth and I love them so much every day.",
            "For the same reason homosexual discourse focuses on gay men and not on lesbians. It is not about protecting people at all. That's just an excuse. It's about the fact that male gender roles are much stricter than female gender roles. MTF transgenderism is an overt violation of these rules(as is being a gay bottom or at least acting effete) and so there is an incentive to punish anyone who was born biological male for daring to do so.",

            "It's not *always* the case but you're right that it's disproportionately the case.\n\nSo the reason is: \"trans discourse\" is made up. It's all manufactured. Neo-Nazi groups (such as the ones who [did a Hitler salute on the Victorian parliament steps](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.abc.net.au/article/102116672) a few months back) have joined a hate campaign against trans people because it's useful. The \"public face\", so to speak, of this hate campaign (known as both \"trans-exclusionary radical feminism\" and \"gender critical\") is to pretend it's feminism. Mind you, this is in line with the \"fourteen words\" creed about \"protecting the sanctity of the white woman\" yadda yadda. To pretend that it's feminism, they need to depict women as the victims of trans people existing. So their main thing is to pretend that trans people who'll exist in the same spaces as cis women (i.e. trans women) are Satan, or perverts, or dangerous.\n\nThey also say that trans men are confused girls, or autistic lesbians, [being groomed/abused/\"damaged\" by the \"dangerous trans women\"](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreversible_Damage). (Any likeness to historical blood libel is on purpose: they're Nazis and Nazi sympathisers)\n\nThey also use the clout and money they get (often from far-right American churches) to go after any woman who does not follow their ideals. For instance, [intersex black women](https://dbknews.com/2019/05/10/caster-semenya-lynsey-sharp-olympics-discrimination-controversy/).\n\nWhat it comes down to, is just traditional fascism, really, but the main recruiting tactic of fascists has changed. It's now a manufactured \"culture war\" (read: genocide attempt, but with popular support garnered through Fox News) focused on picking one minority group nobody was prepared to defend and hitting them all the time.\n\nThere's a *lot* to be said about what could naturally account for a difference: people perceive masculine as the default, leaving masculinity as a betrayal, if they perceive trans women as men and trans men as women then there could be a bit of the same effect as in \"lesbians I don't care, but the gays I hate\" and so on... but overwhelmingly the forks and torches crowd has just, [grabbed](https://americanindependent.com/transphobic-rhetoric-right-wing-extremism-threat-lgbtq-laws/) an [almost-acceptable public face](https://www.coe.int/en/web/commissioner/-/pride-vs-indignity-political-manipulation-of-homophobia-and-transphobia-in-europe) to [drag people to fascism](https://www.businessinsider.com/transphobia-ted-kaczynski-tiktok-algorithm-right-wing-self-radicalization-2021-11?r=US&IR=T).",

            "Because trans women typically still have penises, and men with penises are the threat for sexual assault.

It\u2019s complicated, I think the crime rate that is rising is making people on edge and some people are being unfairly targeted. Everyone should be judged as an individual first rather than being judged for the group they belong to. I think trans women are just an easy scapegoat.

Therefore, a person assigned female who identifies as a man is seen as a sign of strength of character and achievement, whereas a person assigned male who identifies as a woman is seen as weak, and a perversion of western values.

Why would there be more MtFs then?\n\nI ended up I think on r/asktransgender at a thread about the topic. The replies from really the only sources with the expertise and proper perspective so I tend to trust their answer.\n\nThey said numbers are basically equal. Its just easier for FtMs to blend in and go unnoticed in society than it is for MtFs. Additionally, women have the impossible beauty standards thing in society. Its rare and very difficult for a MtF to go unnoticed when they're 6 ft+ and weight 200 lb+. Looks more like obvious cross-dressing/drag. Plenty of videos out there of them flipping their lid on people for not calling them their proper pronouns. There's also the voice problem. Men can have high voices, but few women have deep baritone voices.\n\nAnyways. To your 'normal' person, it looks wrong and uncomfortable. Possibly crazy. Crazy = potentially dangerous/threat.

Under patriarchy, it makes sense for a woman to want to become a man, because she\u2019s trying to rise above her station. If a man can wish to become a woman, that means being a man must not be unilaterally better than being a woman, meaning that the idea that men are inherently more valuable than women is flawed, which threatens patriarchy.",

This opens up our inclusions to customers that are restricted by kosher requirements.\u201d*\r  \n\r  \n*The inclusions are intended for bakery or heated applications and require at least a temperature of 125\u00b0F to function properly.*\r  \n\r  \n*\u201cWe recommend that they be added as late in the mixing process as possible, to the dough or mix, in order to avoid excessive heat and friction,\u201d Ms. Pogoreski said. \u201cSome innovative uses include meats, such as sausage links and patties, hot dogs and pigs-in-a-blanket type products.

The game has a variety of complex but disconnected systems that are a grind to progress except with purchasable in game currency, it has a bunch of different in game currencies with complex conversation rates to real money which makes it difficult to tell how much every unit of currency is worth, everything in the game cost in game currency to do (if you want to unequip a weapon/armor you have to pay with in game currency or it gets destroyed).

Raid spends a fuck ton on advertising but they have to have money to sponsor every YouTuber. \n\nI have spent 3 years playing a similar game, Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes. Both are Character collecting games where you upgrade toons through leveling up and gearing them to make them stronger for PVE and PVP content. \n\nAnd shit becomes VERY addicting if you like grinding. In my case I just really like Star Wars.\n\nBut as you can imagine to stay competitive in the game grinding is almost not enough unless you are a long term player. If you want to even participate in the better late game content you have to start dropping money. I can\u2019t speak for raid and from what I recall it isn\u2019t as egregious as SWGOH (since I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s the most predatory of these games) but if they release a new character we are talking ~300 dollars on random drop packs just to reach a max star level (which is pretty much required for anything in the game) Then you are going to still gear them. A gear 1 7 star champ is literally useless. Hell a gear 10 7 star champ is literally useless. \nSo I\u2019m almost positive Raid functions in a very similar way. These games are like REALLY elaborate slot machines.\n\nAnd the game really only need to keep about 100 krakens to stay afloat because they will literally buy anything. Any pack, any deal they will drop the cash to stay in the Uber competitive guilds and beat the newest content first. And new content becomes more and more bullshit if you aren\u2019t super well informed and don\u2019t waste any resources.",

It's more than I'd like to spend on this game, but I already spent $1.  What's $5 more?\n\nThe next level will take a month.  Or $10.  By this point you've said it's okay to spend more to level up.

But you don't have to take my word for it, as there are currently more than 15 million other people who have downloaded the game, and it is currently one of the top something ranked RPG'S on the google play store. So if you want to give it a go then you can go to play store to not only get the game but receive and extra 50,000 silver plus a free epic champion as part of the new player program they are testing. Thank you so much for reading guys and thank you to raid for sponsoring this comment.\n\nAnyways the reason is maybe because even if some people dont like it there are still some other people that do like it and and for the people that dont like it they probably had to play the game first in order to come to the conclusion that they dont like it",

            "Well mobile games are super successful, because of various different tactics they employ to create a urgency for you to fix in the form of a micro transaction.\n\nMost typical mobile games are extremely low budget, so they won\u2019t need much to make back a profit. You can make a significant amount of money from the typical user, but it\u2019s a drop in the bucket compared to what people call \u201cwhales\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhales\u201d account for 1% of the total user in the game, but contribute the majority of the income, because they will spend ungodly amount of cash to achieve what ever goal they wish to overcome.\n\nThe game will have roadblocks, either time based or material based roadblocks, and they are meant to slow the progress of the game to a halt with a cash barrier. \n\nTo maximize the amount of money a given person will spend, it won\u2019t usually ask for money outright, but rather gems or coins that you\u2019ll buy in a pack.\n\nMaking them pay in gems, gives that bit of disassociation from the actual cost, every time you use a gem, because the gems have an arbitrary value. \n\nIn order to make people come back to play their game, they try to make it as rewarding to the user spending the cash as they can. Using big flashy animations and the sorts, and heavily disincentive those who are free 2 play.\n\nSo since they make a load of cash for very little upkeep, they do the only thing that will make them more money. Advertising, if you don\u2019t want to make a better game, the next best thing is to pay people to say you have a better game.\n\nSo they pay anyone and everyone who will take their money, in order to spread the word about their game. The best way to do so is through YouTube sponsors, because most people believe they have a more personal connection to the youtuber they watch. \n\nMaking it easier for people to buy into it, since it\u2019s almost like a personal recommendation from a friend.",

But I'm really glad it did. And I'm really thankful to all of you who dedicated some time to answer me (even with all the calculus involved)!I'd like to point out that some people here are commenting something in the lines of 'the average human is not even 2m tall, and the sun is millions of kilometers wide, of course we are closer to an atom!', and yeah, at first it seems to make sense, but then again, as some kind people pointed out (and that's where my doubt originally came from), atoms are absurdly small. And, yes, although stars are massive, I proposed myself the following mental experiment: if I could increase or decrease the size of a human, at a same proportional and constant rate, would it take longer to a human reach the size of a star or be shrunk to the size of an atom? Of course, here I'm ignoring all physics and biology just for the sake of curiosity about the scale of such big and small things in the universe, and although I love this kind of matter and mental experiments, I'm not so great with math hehehehe! But anyways, thank you all for commenting, and also for the gold! It's my first! :)\n\nEdit 2: Oh, another thing I forgot to mention, but I've seen some people adressed it carefully: There are atoms of different sizes, as there are people and stars of different sizes. In my mind I was just going with the most 'average' measures we could have, like an hydrogem atom, compared to a 1.7m human, and our Sun as our star-sized object in the experiment! Thank you all",

            "According to the average heights by countries in 2019 and its population, and assuming there is the same number of men and women in the population, an average human being is 1.63 m tall.\n\n* A human is 54.3 billion times bigger than the smallest atom (hydrogen).\n* A human is 4.7 billion times bigger than the biggest atom (francium).\n* The smallest known star (EBLM J0555-57Ab) is 64.2 million times bigger than a human.\n* The Sun is 854 million times bigger than a human.\n* One of the biggest known stars (VV Cephei A or UY Scuti) is 1.6 trillion times bigger than a human.\n\nEdit: fixed the  \"stars\" numbers, I apologize, I accidentally used the wrong number as Sun diameter (that was much more bigger). Thanks u/Ramast for pointing it out. The current number should be correct.  \n\n\nEdit: as for the biggest atoms, francium, though extremely unstable, is 5 pm bigger than cesium. Fixed.   \n\n\nAlso updated the \"biggest known star\" record. We really don't know what star is the biggest, whether it's the VV Cephei A or UY Scuti or another, so I took theirs largest estimated diameter (\\~1,900x Sun's radius) and updated the number.",
            "Everyone is doing linear distance (diameter of atom and Star, and height of a person), but I think volume is often a more useful measure of how big something is. The radius of a uranium atom is 1.86x10^-10 m so the volume is 4/3\\*pi\\*r^3 = 2.7x10^-29 m^3 . The volume of a human is around .07 m^3 or 7x10^-2 m^3 . The volume of the sun is 1.4x10^27 m^3 . So humans are about 2.6x10^27 times bigger than atoms and about 2x10^28 times smaller than the sun. So by volume we\u2019re almost in the middle, but a bit closer to the atom. Thanks to u/BeeLeaf17 for correcting me, I initially copied the km^3 volume of the sun by accident.",

So I didn't just make up stuff.  The two small saucers of food they get a day contain a balance of meat (60%), grain (20%) and vegetables (20%).  They each get a teaspoon of a vitamin/mineral mix (that I also make myself) that is sprinkled on top at every meal--two teaspoons/day per cat.  They LOVE this mineral mix.\n\nIf I set out saucers of their lovingly-cooked beef and chicken liver/ raw carrot/quinoa pate' and forget to sprinkle on the mineral mix, they will look up at me, frown, and try to bury the saucers.  Or they just run away from their meals. \n\nThe mineral mix on top is a requirement.",

Humans have the unique ability to detoxify more chemicals from plants than any other living being. These phyochemicals get added to our immune systems as support systems to our own since we cannot create them alone.  A good example of this is anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties bestowed by spicy plants in the nightshade family like peppers which contain capsaicin. Normally this functions as a deterrent to insect/disease pests for plants, yet functions uniquely in our systems where other life forms may experience acute toxicity leading to death upon contact inside the plant cell (bacteria).

After all, if things don't go as planned for the shooter, it won't make any lists or be part of the data pool.  Thats before even measuring deterrents, since shooters almost always specifically choose \"soft\" targets where there will be little resistance.\n\nSo depending on who you ask, it could be less than 5% or more than 20%.",

            "The problem with the wording in your question is that if a active shooting event is stopped before 3 (or 4) or more people are killed then it isn't classified as a mass shooting event.\n\n[This article](https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/08/in-missouri-a-good-guy-with-a-gun-stepped-up-so-can-you/) discusses events where an active shooting has been stopped by a civilian.\n\nOff the top of my head there is the [West Freeway Church of Christ shooting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Freeway_Church_of_Christ_shooting) where only two people were killed before an armed firearms instructor shot and killed the attacker. Since there were only two victims this wouldn't be listed under a 'mass shooting' by most sources.\n\n[An incident](https://kdvr.com/news/local/good-samaritan-shooting-gunman-olde-town-arvada/) in Arvada Colorado last year started when a police officer was killed responding to a report of a suspicious person. A CCW holder responded and killed the attacker. Police failed utterly and shot the man who killed the attacker.  You could consider there were only two victims in this case as well. We don't know if this shooter would have continued to harm other people or if his target was just the police officer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo answer your question, it's really hard to put a solid number on how many have been stopped because, when they're stopped early, they don't always get classified as a 'mass shooting'.\n\nA gun is not a magic wand for good guys. It requires training and good sense to carry effectively. It will not magically make you like a movie action hero where the bullets just miss, but never hit you. It is a tool to give you options and buy you time.\n\nedit: you can go to r/dgu to see a lot of articles where a firearm was used defensively. Maybe not to stop a mass shooting, but still to help people protect themselves when there was someone trying to harm them.",

But that too as he had finished his rampage and was fleeing the scene.

How many were public mass shootings is anyone's guess, but if ignore the number of people killed by law enforcement and just focus on private civilians, it's safe to assume on average about 300 people stop someone actively trying to do harm to others. I'd wager, given that something like 1/5 of all homicides are family related, that a lot of this is domestic violence turned self defense.\n\nGiven that mass shootings (depending how you define them) are a relatively rare phenomenon, the odds that an armed civilian will stop a mass shooting is pretty pathetic. Even when armed law enforcement is nearby, I imagine most shooters will target them first, or just because how chicken shit law enforcement is in the u.s they won't actually do anything.",

Unfortunately, the NRA has fought to stop the federal government from funding any research into gun violence, so it is difficult to find anything  other than anecdotal evidence. \n\nFrom the studies that are availability,  it looks like  of 160 active shooter events, 5 of them were stopped by civilians with guns, and 21 were stopped by unarmed civilians.\n\nLooking at jurisdictions that have introduced concealed carry permits, homicides rates increased 13% in the 10 years following introduction of CCW--notibly, in an era of declining gun violence.\n\nSo, not GREAT evidence against the good guy with a gun theory, but certainly less evidence in favor of it. It would be great if the NRA would allow some unbiased research to help back up their claims.\n\nhttps://abcnews.go.com/US/breaking-nra-backed-theory-good-guy-gun-stops/story?id=53360480",

            "If you know anything about gun laws. Most states require or are teaching that unless you are being threatened.. it is better to escape and only use a gun as a last resort. A lot of rules are also state dependent. So some may allow certain \u201cstand your ground law\u201d vs you better find any means of escape before pulling that trigger or you go to jail REGARDLESS of how many lives you saved.\n\nMany different thoughts/ points of view on this:\n\n- there are ALOT, and I mean ALOT, of law abiding citizens that carry guns. That DOES NOT MEAN they actually know anything about shooting and the mindset you should have. Most people, including cops, don\u2019t really get taught anything about ballistics and the effect of ballistics. Meaning that some people buy ridiculous calibers for self defense.. but when they engage it goes into a person and exits and hits someone else. Or goes through a wall, window, into someone else\u2019s house and kills someone innocent.  Now apply this to the irresponsible gun owners. I.e. where I live in Miami, which is common to hear a shooting because of road rage? And they were \u201claw abiding citizens\u201d\n\n- another thing is that the individual that has the \u201chero complex\u201d and thinks he should eliminate the threat because he is a law abiding citizen that conceal carry\u2019s might not be aware that police are on scene and the cops can, it has happened, confuse the \u201chero\u201d with a criminal. Cops arriving to a scene assume everyone not in uniform is a threat until proven they\u2019re not. Which makes sense.. because any mass shooter can pretend to be the good guy to blend in and then shoot someone in the back, which also has happened, again I\u2019m applying \u201cassume everyone is a threat\u201d in MASS SHOOTING. The \u201chero\u201d might also not be aware of where first responders are and can accidentally shoot the mass shooter and hit a first responder/ cop by accident.\n\nThe more I learn about ballistics, geometries of fire, and escalation of force. The more I realize how little I actually know.\n\nToo many people out there with shitty gun education ruining it for \u201cresponsible gun owners\u201d like I like to consider myself. Which in turn these morons with guns actually end up ruining it for me and every year make gun laws stricter\u2026 when we should just make the courses longer and more educational.

So a cop investigates a suspicious person call downtown. The suspicious person, Troyke, ambushes the cop and kills him with a shotgun. Perhaps Troyke was only targeting police and not the public but it's unknown. So, an armed civilian with a permit, John Hurley, ambushes Troyke and kills the bad guy. There are some cops in a nearby building aware of what's happening. Well, the good guy, Hurley, goes and grabs Troyke's AR-15 style weapon. The cops now come out and see the good guy, Hurley, with the rifle and fucking kill him. So three people died that day. The officer, the bad guy Troyke and the hero, Hurley.",

I don't need a cop who knows the legal complexities of assault litigation, I need a cop to pull the drunk guy off of me, and make sure he doesn't do it again.  \n\nIn fact there tend to be issues when cops know too much about the law.

Thankfully, most of the cops like that get guided away from that behavior, but it can still pop up at inopportune moments.\n\nAlso, if you were to give each officer a full law degree (or equivalent), it would cost as much per hour as hiring a lawyer to write tickets.

            "I think in the United States it's multiple factors. \n\nFirst our judicial system benefits from cops being ignorant of how the system works. There are so many people that benefit from prisoners and recently released inmates. Companies can use inmates for cheap labor under the guise of, \"job skills rehabilitation\" and then get money from the government for employing inmates while paying them pennies. Privatized prisons make tons of money off inmates, it's in their best interest to keep as many people locked up as possible. You don't want cops to potentially cut into their profits.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies have a difficult time keeping the number of officers they need. You don't want to waste a bunch of time having them actually learning about the laws they are supposed to enforce, so you teach them the bare minimum and send them out on the streets. \n\nSchools can make more profit if they don't teach you everything you may need to know at once. A lot of people who go into the police academy will pay for it out of pocket, and most people wouldn't want to dump $50k out of pocket for a job that may not even pay $50k a year. And once they do get a job with a police department there are a lot of them that will pay for additional training. So the same school can charge 3 or 4 times more per classroom hour than they did for the police academy.\n\nTL;DR: People gain a lot more by having poorly trained law enforcement than they do by having a well educated police force.",

Police don\u2019t need to know about contracts, property, tort, tax law, etc. They mainly need criminal law and constitutional law.\n\nSecond, law school is more about understanding concepts and interpretation of the law. For example, how you might interpret laws and previous cases to make an argument for your client. It\u2019s not a lot of statute (the law that\u2019s written down) reading and memorization. In fact, after my first year of law school I barely know any statute law  - I instead know all about a ton of legal concepts. Law school is theoretical and mostly about learning how to argue a side using concepts you\u2019ve learned. Police officers require a much more practical application. The statues they use are intentionally written very clearly so that they need little interpretation and can be applied in a straightforward way. Law school would be of little value in this sense.",
