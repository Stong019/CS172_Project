            "If going to the teachers about bullying never makes the bullying stop, you eventually stop telling the teachers. At that point, the teachers stop hearing about bullying, and may think their advice actually *worked*, solving the problem with minimal time taken from other classroom issues.",
            "TLDR: I think the schools are too afraid to take action. It would require them to actually do something. They worry too much about pissing people off. I think the teachers are powerless to do anything. Lack of resources, too.\n\nI was bullied so much by a duo , it turned into stalking and death threats. Schools did nothing. At all. Not to mention my bullies made a fake video about me being schizophrenic/being in an asylum and posted it across the school. It was the duo's school project. I'm not schizophrenic at all and have never had any mental health problems except depression. Didn't matter. Lost tons of friends.\n\n I wouldn\u2019t have normally brought my parents into it, but I didn\u2019t know what else to do. They were furious. Teachers did nothing, principals did nothing but belittle me for not taking care of the issue. ( I did everything I could.)  My grades slipped because of it and had to get counseling, too.\nI went to online schooling for my last year and a half of school. I found out that a small hand full of others did, too because of bullying.\nMy principal was later arrested for child porn and my assistant principal left after he lost a local election. We think that\u2019s why he didn\u2019t help us.\n\nIn university, my friends and had I had a few scary situations, went to report and was ignored. Girl was raped because of it.  We should have gone to the police when the first incident happened, but were too scared and too angry to. \nPoint is, bullying sometimes turns into crime and even then, no one cares. Even if someone gets hurt.",
            "Yeah, should do something about bullying, one kid casually stabbed in my eyes and lost it when he was bullying me. His parents were warned about he being very rude to his classmates at school. After that stab he was dismissed with a red note on his  certificate. He's a kid but due to his behaviour i lost my eye and I'm still suffering from it. At that time i was the kid who cared about no one and was minding my own stuff all day and that dude literally fucked me up for life.\nEdit : he used a pencil for stabbing me in the eye.",
            "Part of it is the inability to be able to actually *do* anything. You have reports coming in at all sides from the really rather trivial (to the teacher if not the child) to the quite serious with nothing to back it up. My experience is they took systematic and violent bullying very seriously indeed, but the low-lying stuff just got set aside. Expulsion from school was a very, very last resort so it can end up just chatting in a room and nothing gets fixed.",
            "Right? We had this one situation in school where some kids were being little shits towards us, they must have been like 4 years younger than us. Mostly we ignored them thinking they'd get bored but it became a game to them, see how much they could get away with.\n\nOne day we snapped and effectively taught this one kid what birds in flight experience as he sailed through the air down a corridor.\n\nIt wasn't long before a teacher came to talk to us about \"what really happened\" because clearly the kid was exaggerating (yes we were known as the goody two shoes, never hurt a fly type of people), they were less than impressed when we said the kid was telling the truth. \"Why didn't you come tell us about it?\" Because if we'd gone to the teachers with \"help miss, little kids are being mean to us\" what would they have said? Ignore it, you're bigger than them etc etc.\n\nWe got off with no punishment but it's a big problem",
            "It depends entirely on your school administrators.  My son was bullied in kindergarten and they suspended (in school) the bully.\n\nMy son then took it in his own hands when it didn't stop and clocked the kid.  That ended it.",
            "parents",
            "Because adults think that small children = small problems. \n\nThat to an extend, their (the bully's) actions will be quickly forgotten as you'll grow up, because you were kids, that they didn't think to the consequences, you should forgive, and that there's no need to be dramatic about it.\n\n Little do they actually know that it can have destructive consequences. It's as if they always wait for the worse to happen to actually see that bullying has to be taken seriously. As long as the consequences are not visible, then it is a bit of a problem, but not that much.\n\nEdit : thank you dear anonymous person for giving me my first silver medal !",
            "Because depending on where you live it might be difficult to get results and results may have repercussions.",
            "In my experience, modern bullying is verbal, not physical.  It's subjective, and harder to know when someone has crossed the line.\n\nBut if a bully physically assaults a kid, the kid just needs to report it, as most schools have a \"zero tolerance\" policy for violence.",
            "I\u2019d say most behavior by \u201cchildren who don\u2019t know better,\u201d is usually not taken seriously. \n\nI know a guy who sexually assaulted and harassed many, many girls and physically threatened me and the school told us to ignore it.\n\nOne girl was even told that since the majority of harassment and assault took place the year before, that they couldn\u2019t do anything. Schools just fucking suck.",
            "Two main reasons; \n\nFirst: a lot of these bullies are smart and know not to go to far in front of teachers or other students. So student A goes to teacher and says student B is bullying them. Teacher takes down information and goes to the AP with it but the APs hands are tied because it\u2019s a \u201che said, she said\u201d situation. The AP is going to call in student B (the bully) and ask about it and student B is going to deny it until he\u2019s blue in he face. You can\u2019t prove student B did it so you give him a stern talking to and that\u2019s about it. But student B is going to go take it out of Student A again, harder than before and because Student A thinks nothing\u2019s been done, student A keeps quiet about it now. \n\nSecond: let\u2019s say the bullying progressed far enough and there was enough evidence to warrant a parent meeting or suspension. The problem then comes in with the parents. See every parent out there thinks their child is most special flower in the garden and that their child could never be capable of bullying another student. So instead of listening to the evidence the school has, the parent thinks the school is full shit and threatens to go to the news or to sue or something. Gone are the days where parents listen to teachers and APs over their child. \n\nI know all this because my wife is a teacher and tells me about it at least once a school year.",
            "(Mobile formatting, sorry.)  Teacher here. Bullying is such a difficult thing to fix. Kids are smart and sneaky, especially now with cyber bullying. \n\nI had a student one year who came to my class crying every morning. She would just walk to my room sobbing. It was the beginning of the school year and I thought maybe she was just anxious about being in a new school. I\u2019d send her to the office, I let her sit in the hallway to calm down, I\u2019d send it to the bathroom to get fixed up, everything I could think of. She wouldn\u2019t answer anyone\u2019s questions about what was wrong. Turns out, another student in my class had been bullying her all the previous year. She never told anyone about it though. For a year! (Bully ended up moving away before we had a chance to do anything so that was solved.)\n\nA lot of times kids don\u2019t speak up, because there\u2019s this perception that nothing will happen. We can\u2019t do anything if we don\u2019t know about it. Kids are very sneaky. A lot of times kids know what\u2019s going on, and can\u2019t imagine that the teachers don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, but we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on because no one has said anything. If we don\u2019t see it, we can\u2019t do anything about it, and if we do see something it\u2019s almost always the second kid reacting that we see. \n\n I will hear something mumbled, or see something out of the corner of my eye, and not really be sure about what I saw or heard. Unless we have a kid come to us with an issue, we don\u2019t always know what\u2019s going on. \n\nThen when we do know what\u2019s going on, there are very few things we can actually do to fix it. We can\u2019t put the bully in out of school suspension all year.  We have to take care of that child\u2019s needs too. And lots of times those kids are coming from horrible home situations. \n\nWe will do class changes, seating changes, put no contact orders in place, but ultimately, we can\u2019t be everywhere all the time. The only thing that\u2019s kind of worked in my school is building a culture where everyone knows what\u2019s acceptable and what\u2019s unacceptable behavior.  Building those relationships between kids, so the kids can stand up for each other. Giving kids the tools to communicate and giving them the ability to call each other out when they cross a line. Because teachers aren\u2019t always around.\n\nIt\u2019s very complicated, and I feel terrible for all the students that have been picked on. I wish I could place each one of them in a little safe bubble, but they\u2019re always going to be bad people in the world. The best I can do is make my class as comfortable and welcoming as possible. I absolutely do not tolerate any kind of teasing in my room, even if they\u2019re \u201cjust joking around.\u201d That seems to have worked a bit because with kids, sometimes they\u2019ll be hurt inside but laughing outside.\n\nIt\u2019s awful and I wish there was more we could do. I\u2019m sorry.",
            "It is normal part of the social behavior, you can't remove it. But severe bullying is usually seen as failure of the school as an environment, especially of the teachers. And very few communities can admit that they are doing shit wrong.\n\nIn my country I don't even blame the teachers about this anymore. They been made so teethless and powerless. You can barely even remove unruly kids from class without calling police to make sure your back is covered in case the \"little angels\" parents get upset.\n\n\nAnd I was bullied mercilessly in school. You can't make everyone be friends, like those fucking stupid campaigns try to. But you can limit the severity with proper order, discipline, and teachers with authority.\n\nTho my school took bullying seriously after I got kicked unconscious and laid there in the ground with a bloody head. School collectively shat their pants and got shit under control now that the cops and officials were asking tough questions.",
            "I hear that \"something\" needs to be done about bullying all the time but I've never heard a solution, not even in the comments I read.\n\nTalking to the bully or getting adults involved just makes the bully angrier.\n\nPosters and PSAs don't work for anything, especially not the type of kids who are prone to bullying.\n\nParents of bullies are often either neglectful or can't believe their little angel would ever cause problems and how dare you accuse their perfect little crotch demon of any wrong doing.\n\nThe bully doesn't care and will want to bully despite what any adult ever says or does, no matter what punishment they get. The minute they see their target without any grown ups around, it's game over.\n\nSo what exactly IS this \"something\"?",
            "The coaches at my high school had a mentality of \"bullying happens to everyone, so you need to suck it up and get over it.\"\n\nThey forced us to look at the horrific images of the aftermath of the Columbine shooting and gave us a lecture about how the two gunmen were weak people who ended up being nothing. The head teacher/coach basically said, \" you WILL get bullied in high school, but it's all about how you react to it, it happens to everyone so don't take it personally.\" \n\nIt seemed like most teachers throughout my schooling years just brushed it off. There was even a transgender student at my high school to which the teachers openly bashed and talked about in front of other students in class. Practically egging bullies on to heap on the abuse. I hated my school years. And you're right, if adults acted this way they go to prison for assault.",
            "Because there isn't much you can do about it, punish the bullies, talk to their parents etc. if the kid wants to bully all of that will not help or maybe it will stop for a day or two that's it. I experienced lots of bullies and it will not work. One school had the sweetest principal and he felt very bad about it but his hands were tied, saw him 10 years later and he right away knew who I was such a sweet man.",
            "It's mainly because of liability. They really can't do anything, especially as a government funded school.",
            "My mom works as a teacher in a school know for violence, bullying and gangs.\n\nTl;Dr it comes down to parents being shitty parents.\n\nKid gets bullied.  Kid tells teacher.  Teacher tries to punish. Most teacher can do is in school suspension.  Original kid gets beat up for ratting.  If kid tells teacher again, teacher gets parents involved.  If bully is white, parents threaten to sue the school/blame the school for not being able to help their \"special little baby\".  If parents aren't white, parents threaten to sue the school over racism (even if the entire faculty is non-white as well)\n\nTeachers are helpless because they don't want legal action taken against the school.  Parents perpetuate it by not disciplining their kids or treating them as if they're perfect little angels.\n\nBlame the parents.  Not the schools.",
            "Physical bullying has been basically wiped out at my kids school. Now all the bullying is online and it\u2019s by girls. Neither of my boys have ever been bullied by a boy. The mean girls bully everyone. My son was in the counselors office just last week because a girl who had a crush on him wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer and was harassing and threatening him to be his boyfriend for a month. She pulled his hair as she walked past him in math class and the teacher did nothing. The counselors get the seriousness but the teachers simply don\u2019t.",
            ">If an adult did half of what school bullies got away\n\nyeah but its not an adult doing it, and partly why its not taken as seriously",
            "Because no one ever really has the right answer to dealing with kids. You may think \"Well, that's simple, just exert yourself over their will\". You know, be authoritative etc etc. However, what if that kid doesn't listen to your authority and doesn't respect it, what from there? Depending on that kid's age/size there may be nothing you (As a teacher) can do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor an adult, there's always an escalation of force. Verbal, physical, lethal (to put it into short terms), but even if you get physical with a minor in a school setting, people's heads are going to turn. It's easier to just do nothing than to actually stop minor amounts of harassment/abuse, and potentially face some sort of back lash for laying hands on a child. This is even presuming you could do something, if that bully is already six feet 200 something pounds, there's not much to be done by the average school house educator.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOf course, consider this a working theory.

            "As a victim of bullying as a child, and as a person who worked as a public school teacher for several years, and as a person who now works in higher-education, and as a person who studies social interactions as a career:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1) Not all bullying is bad. A *certain amount* of antagonism is necessary to grow as a human, such as learning coping mechanisms during difficulty.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2) Bullying exists in all facets of life, not just childhood. Learning to deal with bullies at a young age helps you deal with bullies as an adult (arguing with insurance adjusters, or going through court, for instance).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3) There is a point where children need to learn to solve their own problems. *Depending on the nature of the bully/situation*, children should be encouraged to be independent and solve their own problems rather than to remain dependent upon the intervention of authority.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4) It is difficult for adults to understand the severity of situations as explained by children. Children (including teens) tend to over-inflate their descriptions (limited vocabulary, high emotion, little experience), so adults who regularly deal with children assume the descriptions are inaccurate. This means that adults are less likely to understand when bullying passes from \"normal childhood interactions\" into \"this is bad\" territory. That's why counselors have special training that teachers do not have.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n=======\n\nRegarding the OP's quote:\n\n> If an adult did half of what school bullies got away with they'd be in prison for the next 10 years. \n\nI don't know how old OP is, but I assure you adults are bullied all the time. Sales reps for companies often use shady tactics, in some cases outright lies, to trick people into contracts they don't want. The person then has to fight  to get charges overturned/refunded/stopped. You'll understand this when you sign up for your first phone contract or internet service.\n\nThe law is not fair. When you are wronged, cops and lawyers will not always solve it. You can be 100% right, and you will still loose because you aren't as stubborn as the other guy. You will learn this when your car gets towed or you get in a vehicle accident.\n\nBullies are everywhere. They don't go away, they just get more sophisticated.",

That bullies were just cowards and you just needed to stand up for yourself to get them to stop. That shit never fucking worked. It always felt to me like they were waiting for you to stand up for yourself so that they could justify actually physically hurting you instead of just saying cruel things. I got the feeling that the mantra of \"you just need to stand up for yourself\" was probably invented by the bullies to lure their victims into an actual ass whopping.",
            "Schools don't care cause it's a black eye on their reputation. If they have to document it they have to admit they have a problem. It's usually the bullied kid that gets in more trouble.",
            "Not good for school\u2019s reputation, which would reduce the amount of people who\u2019d get their kids to attend there, hence no money/funding.\n\nHappens not only in US, also in Asian countries.",
            "They take it super seriously. I work in the education system and can offer you my observations:\n\n\nThe education system has far too little funding. That means that there are not enough teachers, admin, and support staff in the building. They are hard at work trying to keep up with all of the junk that they have to do, part of which, is handling bullying. But here's the catch, the people that have to deal with bullying have to deal with every piece of drama that comes into the school too, everything from two friends that are having a word fight on Insta, to students that need help from the authorities because of their home situations. \n\n\nHere is an example, I work in a small school; one principal and one counselor. If they are required to call the authorities or have a parent meeting, that could take up a big chunk of their afternoon. And that's not including the stack of paperwork required after those meetings. So if your teachers do as they are supposed to, and report the bullying, it gets put on a big stack of things for the admin to deal with after all the other stuff. \n\n\nNobody in the education system is in it for the money. I would bet that almost all of them are in it because they want to help kids. Schools are underfunded, staffs overstretched, and the list of responsibilities keeps growing. For every program that the school is required to add, that takes away time that admin could be using to deal with student issues.\n\n\nI'm very sorry about your experience. I don't think that I was ever bullied, so I can't say I can relate, but I know how bad words can hurt and send you all of my empathy. But, let's (collectively) blame the system, because in many ways it's broken, and can be fixed with proper funding and management. Let's not blame the people who make very little, in a thankless field, that truly care about the students.",
            "Part of the problem is not only belittlement for adults, but from peers. I remember in elementary school (Speaking as a high schooler now), that anti-bullying everything was shoved down our throats at all hours of the day. Heck, every morning we had to recite \"the peace builders pledge\". These things didn't actually reduce bullying, it just turned bullying into a joke. Not a single soul from that point on would take you seriously if you said you were being bullied. Saying \"I'm being bullied\" was literally the punchline to near every joke I can remember from middle school. This complete lack of caring about bullying spread into the teacher, under the false assumption that \"well if the kids are joking about bullying, then there must be no bullying!\" Wich was entirely false. Speaking as someone who was bullied quite a bit through elementary and middle school (high school has been much better, Happy to say), none of the students took bullying seriously, so the teachers didn't either.

            "As a teacher, I do whatever I can to stop bullying from happening on the school campus.  I was a victim of bullying throughout my own school experience, and can relate to a lot of what you are saying.  I've had educators dismiss my claims and others take them seriously.  Now that I'm on the other side, I can see now the challenges to dealing with this difficult issue.  \n\nThe general educational community is aware that bullying is an UNACCEPTABLE reality in our schools.  Guaranteeing the mental and physical safety of our students should be the first priority of any learning community.  However, it is the most difficult problem to address.  Think of the solutions:\n\nCut the music program to fund an increase in security; turn your school into a prison?  \n\nLecture kids to death about respecting each other?\n\nSeverely punish bullies?  For many kids who are behavior problems, a schools's worst punishments (suspension or expulsion) are not a punishment at all.  \n\nThe comments in this section make some broad assumptions about schools that I want to clarify.\n\n1. Most bullying happens outside of the classroom in hallways, buses, locker rooms and restrooms.  Places that are often NOT monitored by adult supervision.  This is getting better with the installation of security cameras, but there are lots of places where students are not monitored where bullies like to target others.\n2. Schools often do not have the resources to protect students from being bullied.  Think about it, a student is being bullied throughout the school day.  What can you do to protect them?  Punish the named bullies?  You would have to catch them in the act (see point 1).  Plus it often doesn't work.  In most cases, if adults catch them in the act, then they will punish, which often doesn't stop the bullying or makes it go even more underground.  What if it's a number of students (as is often the case)?  Give the victim a personal body guard throughout the day?  Isolate them from the rest of the student body?  \n3. Schools are too overburdened, understaffed, and underfunded (vs. lazy) to do enough to stop all bullying.  Teachers constantly talk with each other about students of concern who could be potentially being the target of bullying.  We watch out for them in the hallways when we can and we do our best to stay vigilant in the classroom while also trying to teach you how to read, do algebra, and dissect that frog.  If a teacher doesn't address a problem adequately, it's rarely because they are lazy.  I am constantly exhausted and overworked.  If I missed something, it's because I am a fallible human with one so many pairs of eyes in the back of my head.  Moreover, School administrators spend 90% of their time dealing with bullies and disciplinary issues.  It's essentially all they do.  Being a vice principal these days has become equivalent to being a prison warden instead of an educational leader.  \n\nIf you were bullied and you want to stop it from happening, instead of pointing the finger of blame at a system that has been desperately laboring by itself to fix this problem, get involved yourself.  Join a boys and girls club and help out a kid.  Start supporting your local schools and your neighbors.  Teach kids to respect each other.  Have patience.  Be compassionate.  \n\nThat's what I did.  I've devoted my life to making schools a safer environment by creating a better world than the one I grew up in, one student at a time.",
            "Lack of evidence is usually the case.\n\nYou can\u2019t go kicking people out of school on an accusation much like you can\u2019t put them in prison.\n\nAll you can do is try to make bullying such heinous social crime to children that their peers enforce it not happening and mass complaints can be made to teachers.\n\nSnitching isn\u2019t glamourised but it\u2019s actually the only way you can get more solid evidence of it taking place.\n\nTell your kids it\u2019s ok to tell on people who do wrong and stop the culture of \u201cIt\u2019s none of my business\u201d",
            "I did a report about bullying in college. Just some common facts that might help answer this question. \n\nMost bullying happens when no adults are present. Therefore, adults are less likely to physically see the bullying take place. \n\nMany bullies are being bullied by their parents or are a bully themselves. A bully's parent usually will not see the problem. Think \"that's just how boys are at that age\", or \"I think you're mistaken, my son wouldn't do that.\" \n\nCyber bullying is quickly over taking other forms of bullying. Again not done directly in front of adults. \n\nBullying tends to immediately stop if someone (a student or teacher) cuts in and stands up for the victim when an act is happening. Although, people are more likely not to get involved and watch it take place. \n\nSchools have a tendency to under report fights and incidents to the state.",

            "I think society is just really beginning to deal with bullying and it, like racism, is going to take multiple generations to deal with, if not it just becoming something that rises and falls in popularity according to the times.

Even in shows like TBBT the cast, often victims of bullies, are bullies themselves when given the power position in a relationship. Hell, we just elected a bully for president!

            "I really dont agree with a lot of the answers here. While theyre not entirely wrong, i think its more about \"what can the school even do\". I had a conversation with a teacher about this once. The people that do the bullying probably dont have parents that care enough to do something about it, so going to the parents probably wont help. Bullies likely dont care about grades so punishing them that way wont have much effect. You can expel them, but in a lot of cases thats a bit extreme\n\nThe answer \"just ignore them\" is often given because it is what works, even though its not as simple as it sounds like.

            "Why isn\u2019t bullying taken more seriously by other kids? More often than not, the witness to a bullying moment is another kid. Do they tell? A teacher really only hears 1/100 of the bullying that happens, so they handle it *what the think is* appropriately for a first time offense.",
            "I\u2019m gonna be honest, ignoring them and telling them they aren\u2019t worth your time, show dominance over them, and they won\u2019t bother you. If they try to beat you up, fight back. They won\u2019t bother you, even if you lose. (Well maybe).\n\nBut I\u2019ve always wondered this. I think it all comes down to telling someone about it, which most victims don\u2019t. Nobody tells anyone that they\u2019re being bullied, which they NEED to do. I can\u2019t express this enough. I was bullied and didn\u2019t really realize it until now and never told anybody.

            "The cynic in me comes to the conclusion that we really are just more advanced animals, and that infighting between species is just a battle for dominance and completely normal. Ideally, people would absolutely help the victims, and in some cases, measures are taken. But a bully is relentless, and will just keep abusing their victim as long as they \"let\"(can't do somethong about) it.\nThe only stories where bullying was solved that I read were the ones where the victim just fought back. No such thing as a civil solutions to this problem I believe. I personally blame our prumal instincts.",
            "For one, the school's hands are tied. The worst punishment a school can give is in-school suspension, and since when has that ever corrected misbehavior?\n\nThe only acceptable thing a teacher can do is tell the parents. But so many parents these days don't give a flip what their kids are doing. They don't care that their kids aren't doing their work, they don't care that their kids are disruptive holy terrors, so why would they care that their kids are bullying others?\n\nTo top it all off, many parents are downright *awful* to teachers (as they probably are to everyone else as well). They consider teachers to be not professional educators, but glorified babysitters. The amount of disrespect teachers get from many parents is insane. There are some awful teachers that deserve the disrespect, but a lot of them don't. This makes teachers loathe contacting parents about anything.\n\nI don't know how it is elsewhere, but where my wife (an elementary school teacher) works, she's required to report bullying incidents to the parents of all students involved. There was an incident just this semester where a couple girls got into a physical fight. After all the details came out, the parent of the bully still maintained her kid's innocence and pulled her kid out of the school rather than dealing with the problem.\n\nTeachers have enough on their plate as it is. They can't create the lesson plans, buy all the materials, teach the lesson, grade the work, and everything else, all while trying to parent the dozens of kids they see every day. The question we should ask isn't why schools don't take bullying seriously, but why the bully's parents don't.",
            "Bad news, bullying isn't taken seriously in many places. I've been threatened before and got barely any support from friends.\n\nWhy is that? Because people aren't trained to deal with bullies. Trying to figure out how to move an immovable object is super stressful, so people prefer to just let it be and hope it solves itself.\n\nIn reality, it's not that hard to deal with bullies if you're a third person. All I have to do is call them out and I've made good progress. But then I could become a target, and that causes me a lot of stress. I'll just wait for someone else to do it... Anytime now...\n\nThat's called the bystander effect, and it's kind of the reason why these issues always go on for longer than necessary. Bullying can be taken down really efficiently, but most people aren't capable of that.\n\nEDIT: Besides that, there's the importance of being \"fair and balanced\". Detecting exactly when a situation is no longer fair is hard, and calling it out too early is very damaging to the goal of reducing bullying.\n\nThere's a million more reasons I could think of over time and I could keep adding on and on. But the important thing is that it's simple but hard, and the stakes are high.",

And the jocks in my school were relentless, and everyday i came to school i was bullied. I battled then and now with Dysthymia depression and severe ADHD. And i was on the brink of suicide for months. But everyday i would do my best to avoid them (failure 9 times out of 10) and just be alone, or i would later tell on them. I heard the classic \"quit snitching\", also \"just ignore them\", even the fan favorite, \"tell us when it happens so we can help\". None of these things worked. What did work, you may ask? Let them bully. Now i do understand that this will not work for all. But for me in my situation this worked cuz it set me up for the future of rejections, not being first, gave me \"thick skin\".  I feel as though i have the ability to just shrug off all of those negative things being said, all of the negative crap done to me. And be able to move on with things that are important to me and are considered priorities for me and my family. I feel very successful in my life and chalk part of it to the fact that i was bullied, cuz i dont think i would have the perseverance and determination today if it wasnt for it. This is my input to why i think the schools dont address it the way alot of us wish they would. By the way my 14y son get bullied almost everyday as well, and in our home he gets rewarded when he handles a bully the way we taught him.

            "I think because it's the teacher's responsibility in the classroom. If they start to take responsibility outside of the classroom, it would become a full time commitment, and teachers just aren't paid for that. It is also maybe cheaper economically for the child to learn on their own until adulthood. Fines, prison, making them pay out of pocket for their injuries if they get in a fight, settling it in court. It is guaranteed when someone commits a crime and you make them pay, versus paying the teacher to 'teach them right' without the guarantee of the kids being better citizens. How would a teacher guarantee no bullying from here on out?\n\nSomeone would have to make it a law or part of the teacher's responsibility. Laws and money run the world. Someone would have to push for it at the higher level. Teachers might know what they wish they could do, but it's not worth it for them to not get paid for these extra responsibilities. Essentially the advice to \"ignore them\" is acceptable because that's what's legal. The school would have to enforce no bullying, putting more stress on the adults, or just tell kids they should ignore these aggressive kids. Stress and time are much more valuable to adults, and just like debt, it's accepted to make the future generation pay. The bottom line is, it's not the teacher's problem, because it's not their responsibility. Maybe burnout is involved if they got paid the same, but had to stay afterschool or talk to parents outside of class about these personal disputes.\n\nI think also the parents need to involve themselves, because it's their children. It's not illegal to bully as a kid, so if parents care, they need to step up. They are the ones with more incentive to protect or raise their child, not the teacher.",

I\u2019m not sure if this makes sense but with how the school had it\u2019s power taken and how the parenting is with many kids I\u2019m not sure what the solution would be.",
            "I teach my boys this information: \n\n There are three types of people in this world: sheep, wolves, and  sheepdogs. Now, some people prefer to believe that evil doesn\u2019t exist in  the world\u2026those are the sheep. And then you got predators who use  violence to prey on the weak. They\u2019re the wolves. And then there are  those who have been blessed with the gift of aggression, and the  overpowering need to protect the flock. These men are the rare breed  that live to confront the wolf. They are the\u00a0*sheepdogs*. \n\nNow, if someone is picking on my boys, or someone is picking on my youngest son or my daughter.  My kids have been taught that they will never start anything, but they sure as hell are going to end it.  Any teacher who has a problem with this can give me a call and I'll be right down at that school.  I ain't raising no sheep, and I would woop their ass if I found out they are wolves.  They are the protectors of their flock. \n\nWe need more kids to be brought up like this.",

            "In my experience - schools do not have the support (trailing) or resources necessary to tackle bullying in a healthy and mutually befinificial manner. Most schools are left to either over react (and force kids into the school-to-prison pipeline) or underact (and do nothing at all). Mental health services simply do not exist in most of our public school, and counselors spend the majority of their time with scheduling and IEPS. Schools need more funding to hire more professions, and to provide better training for staff. In addition - with 30+kids per teacher. Hundreds of kids per counselor. There are not enough opportunities for one-on-one interactions with adults for the adults to actually witness and address the issue.",

When I stood up against my bullies, I was unfairly punished.\n\nNow, my self esteem and confidence is pretty much non existent from previous bad experiences.\n\nSchool is a shitty learning environment, the school system needs to get their shit together.",
            "\n\nSee here\u2019s the thing, \nWhen bullying occurs between minors in a school setting, whether it\u2019s verbal or physical, school has the ultimate responsibility in ensuring your well-being and such responsibility of ensuring your \u201cwell-being\u201d means that such incidents will have to be documented for legal purposes.  If they fail to up hold their end, they\u2019re susceptible  to law suits from the parents, and they don\u2019t sue the school. They sue the WHOLE DISTRICT. Very very very bad. A big no no. \n\nYou see, when you get in trouble and they court you to the counselor or whatever and have you explain your situation. They\u2019re mainly looking for liability or negligence on THEIR PART that might\u2019ve caused the fight.  Their second job is to document what happened, this record will be retained and recited back if parents of involved parties decide to go to the courts. the school can provide a track record stating they\u2019ve done their part accordingly which ultimately is just general negligence, not Gross negligence. \n\nSo your question is tricky but not intended so. Is bullying taken seriously by school? From a legal standpoint and on the severity of bullying, yes it\u2019s taken very seriously by schools. \n\nIs it being taking seriously as in they evaluate each students actions and then make a conforming, appropriate decision?   \n\nMaybe, but majority of the time, hell fucking no.\n\n\nDisclaimer: I oversimplified the entire process for the sake of clarity and understanding.  It is also not as to say that school literally don\u2019t care about you, this is just the reality of things when shit hits the fan. I also not saying this occurs with every instance of reported bullying. the severity and context matters ALOT. Context as in is the school in a susceptible position to get sued. \n\n\nI have a personal story I can share based on this;\n\nSome kids stole my PSP in middle school. It was a white PSP in 2007, which can only be purchased in Hong Kong.   \n\nI got the principle involved, they bushed it off. Told me the username didn\u2019t match the one I provided so therefore it\u2019s not stolen. YOU CAN CHANGE THE DAMN FUCKING NAME THO. \n\nSo I had to get my mom, a lawyer involved in this stupid middle school bullshit. My mom, visibly fucking pissed that I\u2019m wasting her time with this, told the school that she still had the box with matching serial number, and that the school did not grant a proper due process in an attempt to close it quickly. \n\nLiterally within the next day, a fucking school counselor GOT the psp from the kid that stole it and handed back to me. And the kid that stole it and his friends that help him lie got expelled.",

            "As someone who works in a school and handles a majority of the bullying issues, I see both sides. \n\n1. The school has a legal obligation per state law to investigate any report of bullying. Where I work, any report is investigated and there are about 25 different avenues we take to try and rectify the situation and make the building a safe place for everyone. We don\u2019t take it lightly. We try to get parents involved, we lay out consequences, we move schedules if we need to, etc. \n\n2. Some teachers just down right suck. I\u2019ve met complete idiots who will hear someone bullying someone and tell them to stop and just move on thinking they did their part. If that\u2019s who kids are going to, it ends there. Which sucks. Then there are the teachers who will go ape shit and do an awesome job of helping administration with handling the situation. \n\n3. Some kids say their being bullied when someone looks at them wrong or used a tone.  This detracts from the seriousness of those kids who really are being bullied. If 99 kids cry wolf, the one who is truly being bullied suffers the consequences. \n\n4. If bullying is happening outside of school, call the cops and report it. Schools can only handle what occurs in the school. \n\nParents who condone this behavior and encourage assholery from their kids are truly the cause of this mess we\u2019re in. I speak to parents all the time who try to make the school into the problem when their kids do something stupid. There\u2019s so many kids in a building, no one is targeting your kid. If we say they\u2019re being a dick, they\u2019re being a dick. Those kids are the reason we have the issue we do. \n\nAt the end of all this, is the administration won\u2019t do anything for you/your child, cal the state department of education and report them. That\u2019ll make some noise and get to the bottom of it. If the school is doing their part then they\u2019ll have the documentation to prove it. Otherwise, they\u2019ll be at the mercy of the state.",
            "There seems to be a trend in the UK where teachers ignore bullying until the victim retaliates, then they harshly punish the victim. Disgraceful.",

Instead it\u2019s everyone who thinks the teachers are to blame, when in reality it\u2019s often the parents who have made teachers powerless and enable their children to be the bullies they are. \n\nAs a teacher, 90% of the time I talk to a parent about their kid\u2019s behavior the parent acts just like the kid. \u201cApple syndrome\u201d is very real.",
            "I teach middle school and I have some ideas.\n\nA) It's tough to get solid evidence of bullying. Bullies usually act out away from adults... or only around adults they know will not intervene.Unless the teacher sees it, it's a \"he said/she said\" situation that is inherently difficult to resolve. Since bullying is by definition a repeated occurrence, staff has a hard time building a case for bullying as an ongoing issue.\n\nB) \"No snitches.\" Kids protect each other, even when they don't want to, due to social pressure. This makes it even harder to build a case (see A).\n\nC) Some administrators are trying to protect their reputation instead of solving problems. There are loads of bad principals around. \n\nD) Some teachers are tired, some are lazy or checked out, some don't know what to do, and most don't have the kind of relationships with kids where kids will open up about this kind of thing.\n\nE) Weirdly, bullying is actually easier to spot now since so much of it happens on social media.But kids then have to open up this part of their lives to adults around them, and many are reluctant to do so for various reasons.\n\nSchools can be sucky. You know who the good teachers are in the building. Be shrewd about who you tell, and document your case including being ready to give names of witnesses.",
            "This one guy bullied my friend in School for 5 years straight, the School did nothing to stop this despite constant meetings from his parents and reports from other people. I'm normally quite passive but that had gone on for long enough; on the last day of School the guy decided to start on me, stamping on my arm and such when sitting on the higher row of chairs behind us, as soon as we got back to the changing room I beat the ever loving snot out of him, then the School had the audacity to try say that I should have told them instead of taking matters into my own hands, I informed them that that's what my friend has done for the past 5 years and look what that did for him. Honestly Schools are not doing enough to stop bullying.",
            "It\u2019s funny, because when I did speak up about being bullied, I was punished as well as the people who were bullying me. They spread a rumor that I was going to shoot up the school (around the time that Virginia Tech was shot up). The administration just wants to look good. I did nothing wrong and I still got punished.",
            "Teacher here.  My thinking on this is kind of two-fold.  On the one hand, yes, legitimate bullying is a serious thing, but I think it'd be inaccurate to say that's not being taken at least more and more seriously by most administrations and the education system as a whole with the passage of time.\n\nOn the other hand, and this is totally an off-record thought collection that I'd never verbalize to my admin, while we absolutely want each and every kid to feel safe at school, both physically and mentally, I don't think it'll do anyone any favors in the long term to really micro-micro-micro manage inter-student socialization, because it stifles the students' social development, and I feel like social development and the ability to manage conflict is *especially* important through the elementary grades.  As adults, we don't live in a world that's completely free of interpersonal conflict, and it's important that kids learn how to manage said conflicts while the stakes are still comparatively low.  Obviously, things like physical mistreatment and clear cases of mental/emotional mistreatment (direct name-calling, for example) absolutely should be addressed by the adult(s) in the room, and in the good schools, it consistently is.  That having been said, in the same way that every business has leaders that are completely out to lunch, many schools have teachers that are unwilling or unable to address issues that truly demand intervention by the school (on both a micro and macro level).  There are plenty of schools that need serious improvement in this area, and there are a lot of components that factor into the reason that they've fallen behind the curve on this.  Teaching is a job, at the end of the day, and if a district is unable to attract talented teachers, they're going to wind up with a staff that isn't completely able to address the problem.  For every teacher you show me that's willing to teach in a bad area with little admin support for 40k a year, I'll show you 10 that will take a hard pass on that, and teach at the best school they can.  Maybe they're making less of a difference in the education system as a whole, but for good teachers, the work is rewarding anywhere they can feel like their students are learning, so they (understandably) go for the best-paying gigs with a strong admin support staff.  You'd have to be a saint or have literally no other options to accept a gig in a troubled district that's unwilling to compensate for the added stress via a competitive salary.\n\n>If an adult did half of what school bullies got away with they'd be in prison for the next 10 years.\n\nI would *never* let something go if the adult equivalent of the action would be something that could land in prison.  But, while we make an effort to incorporate human values into our curriculum (all the way up through high school), I think it'd be a disservice to our students to micromanage every last action of every last student that could be construed as even slightly offensive to another student.  As teachers, part of our job is to prepare our students for life once their primary schooling is complete.\n\nTL;DR - Legitimate bullying is, IMHO, being taken very seriously by school districts that are worth their salt.  Micromanaging offensiveness, and trying to accommodate for the \"offense threshold\" of every student is both practically impossible, and (IMHO) not always a good thing for students.",

Where as on cell phones, it comes from your phone, to a tower, through fiber optic cables, to another tower, and to the other phone. High speed internet is about the same. And, the frequency that the newscast networks use is a VASTLY lower frequency than HSI or cell networks.

If you see them nodding their heads instead of answering, it's because they were still on standby and weren't cued on time. Sometimes the delay is massive and sometimes it's a second off.

If you\u2019ve baked one lasagna, and then either placed another baked one on top, or put a second lasagna on top and then bake it...  you\u2019ve got two lasagnas stacked...  but if you double the number of layers as if you made two lasagnas, even if you put a thicker layer of cheese in between prior to baking the entire thing ones...  then you\u2019ve just got one big ass lasagna.",

            "Alright so after some deep thinking, I think I\u2019ve found a solution. A lasagna is simply just layers, and adding another lasagna on top would just add more layers, thus making a larger lasagna, right? Wrong. A lasagna only becomes a lasagna when the layers have been intimately introduced to each other, such as the sauce softening up and flavoring the pasta, or the cheese melting into the sauce. Simply stacking 2 lasagnas wouldn\u2019t make a big lasagna, it would just be a 2 lasagna tower. However, if you perhaps melt some cheese on top of the first lasagna, and more on the bottom of the second with some sauce in between, that would become a double thick lasagna because the layers have melded. \n\nTLDR: It would only become one lasagna if you somehow combine the 2 lasagnas with another layer.",

Or to some degree, perhaps it does, whether you've made lasagne in one or two pans, kept them separate or smooshed it together, in the end its all just some lasagne.\n\nReal answer: the best part of lasagne is the baked cheese crust on the top.

You can add more water but it's still one glass of water, just of a greater magnitude.  So my initial instinct is to say your stacked lasagna is indeed just one lasagna. \n\nHowever, it occurs to me that order could matter.  Suppose both lasagnas are layered as such: noodle - sauce - cheese - noodle - meat - cheese - noodle.  If we then stacked them, there would be a double noodle layer where they meet, disrupting the order of the original lasagnas.  In this case, I think I'd lean towards the stack remaining two lasagnas.  But also, if we cut off the last noodle in my example, then the stacked order would not disrupt the original, but instead repeat it, which falls in line with my first argument in favor of the stack being one lasagna of a greater magnitude.\n\nConclusion.  If order doesn't matter, then it's one lasagna.  If order matters, then it depends on if the stacked order changes the pattern of layers.",

            "Forks are my \"native utensil\", but after using chopsticks for years they really do feel like two totally different tools, suited best for different things. Chopsticks are for grabbing while forks are for stabbing. Forks are great for a meal like mashed potatoes and chicken because you can shovel it up or cut with the side of the fork.

Chopsticks for french fries, amazing! Tired of greasy and salty hands from potato chips or popcorn?  Chopsticks!  Especially useful as a gamer.  Spaghetti or any long noodle pasta?  Chopsticks!  Forks and spoons have their place but I feel sometimes like I\u2019m using a shovel and a pitchfork and just stabbing and scooping everything as opposed to the precise control chopsticks offer.  I\u2019m not a mad lad though, spoons and forks do have their place.  Curry, corn, peas, mash potatoes, ice cream...  Now that I think about, I\u2019m not sure a fork is all that useful and with most things you can get by better with a chopsticks / spoon combo.\n\nEdit: Just realized you weren\u2019t asking about spoons but my point still stands.  Chopsticks and spoon combo is superior to fork and spoon combo.  If I had to choose between only using chopsticks or a fork, I\u2019d go for chopsticks.",

Started with spoon and fork, and used the spoon as the knife. \n\nWhen I started learning knives, it confused me where to hold it; if it should be on the left, so I can shovel food with my fork on the right; or with my dominant hand, then put the utensils down, and pick my fork to bring food to my mouth. \n\nRegardless, I feel that forks are inefficient in most foods (peas? Rice? It doesn't get a lot of food). If I'm going to use just one hand,  spoons are more efficient: soups, meat-cutting, rice, even noodles and pasta.",
            "I live in Vancouver where we have some of the best SE Asian cuisine offered around. \n\nA few years back I got tired of asking for forks at Chinese/Thai/Vietnamese/Korean restaurants so I vowed to myself to put the fork down and pick up the stix.\n\nI spent 2-3 years using chopsticks and I modestly say my chopstick skills are pretty good. I can pick up rice by the grain now!  \n\nThe switch kind of sucks, but once you get the hang of it you'll understand why people use them.  I even use them when cooking now!"

Happened so frequently that it made me wonder if you could somehow pick up on the \"incoming call/message\" signal with your brain or something.\n\nA message could possibly mean several hours of manipulative hell, and I swear I could feel whenever I was getting a call or a text by the end of the relationship. My best \"scientific\" explanation is that I heard the call and subconsciously retrofitted the memory before I was consciously aware of the call.\n\nI guess it's theoretically possible that my brain began to pick up on the incoming signals that meant that \"we\" would feel terrible in just a few of seconds, but I'm really skeptical to that perspective.",

Until then I was fielding calls from other states. It WAS exhausting, exhilarating, and empowering all at once.

What they do have is cheap, low nutrition, un-satiating, calorific food. Stressed? Chocolate bar. A treat at the end of a long day? Takeaway. Bad day? Alcohol.

Poorer families may struggle to find affordable healthy food, have fewer chances to exercise, and experience more stress, which can make it harder for them to manage their weight.",

People often forgo the health quality of food when they are forced to make that choice.\n\nThere's also the fact that more money can afford you more ways to safely be physically active. Travel, gym memberships, home gym equipment, and large spaces to run around in all cost money. \n\nAdditionally, there may be more pressure in rich families to adhere to a desired image. Even if a rich kid would choose to eat junk and never be active, their parents may pressure them to maintain a certain image of health to keep the family looking good. I know that, in high school, my classmate with 2 doctor parents was always the most stressed about her grades. She did also eat as well as she could to keep weight off. I can only assume that her parents or even just herself pressured her to uphold certain standards of the family academically and beyond",

Trust me, rich kids eat as much junk food as the next, not ultra processed meat all the time is one difference but the 24/7 cycle of activity easily access contributes much more and then builds upon later in life.

            "People will say that it's because money means they have access to healthier food, while partly true, it's really not the whole story. I've been a personal trainer for many years, wealthier people just have a better foundation of knowledge, they know what foods to avoid, what foods to buy, people from a lower socioeconomic background often have questions like, is chocolate milk healthy, is bacon a good protein source, things that wealthier people generally have always known. Healthy food is not more expensive, it's simply either not as tasty to some, or not as convenient. I've worked with probably over 100 people now, building diet plans as a part of the service, every single person who was unhealthy and regularly eating convenient processed foods has saved significant amounts of money switching to a healthy diet. \n\nEducation around healthy eating really needs to be implemented more in to schools and for parents in low socioeconomic areas, although I suspect it's much more complicated than that. Many people are just unwilling to put in more effort with preparing meals, it's always going to be easier to put chicken nuggets in the oven than it is to make a healthy meal from scratch. What also isn't mentioned when this question is raised is also wealthier people more often are in two parent households, and when one parent is a stay at home parent, there's just so much more time to be doing this stuff.",
            "Other than healthier food they also have better options for physical activity. Like for example I'd have loved to send my son to camp in the summer. I think he'd have thrived and benefited from getting out like that. I would love to pay for him to go to the gym now that he's a teen. He can't be in any school sport because you have to pay like 1700 bucks for insurance, transportation and uniform at his former school. For the first seven years of his life we lived in such a bad neighborhood it wasn't safe to even be in your own backyard, we found that out in a very tragic way. Also I wonder, he has some pretty serious health issues and I wonder how much better his overall health would be if I had good insurance because our state insurance gives us so much grief and like, one thing is we can only find one endocrinologist that takes our state insurance who is accepting new patients and this doctor should not be in practice. She just shouldn't. I am not one of those \"This is America speak English\" people but she barely speaks English and she is definitely not trans-affirming or considerate of autistic people. When my son showed visible distress at the thought of more blood tests she told him he needed to put on his big girl panties. She barely speaks English but she knew enough to make my kid feel like shit.  \n\n My son's condition causes him to retain fluid and his arms and legs are swollen and his face is round.  He's overweight. I try to help him have a balanced diet and I make him get up and move but he's in a lot of pain. He got physical therapy for eight weeks but state insurance cut him off after that even though it really helped.\n\nBut I digress. I'm just saying I bet my son would get better medical care if I was wealthy.",

This can help them learn healthier behaviors for dealing with stress and negative emotions besides just figuring it out on their own, overeating or hiding in their bedrooms on their preferred electronic device.\n\nNot only that though, wealthy parents can afford to send their kids to swim classes, dance lessons, summer camps, private schools, and any recreational activity without having to pick and choose based on money. Hell, these kids can be doing multiple physical activities per day and have the caregiving necessary to transport them to and from said activities without the parents having to miss work or income.\n\nOthers have mentioned access to healthier food options as well, which certainly contributes greatly, but only represents part of the picture. \n\nImagine growing up having better caregiving, more activities to do, less stressful lifestyles, and better food options.

            "It makes sense, in most nations nowadays, it\u2019s the poor people that are the fattest, it\u2019s mainly because they have less time to cook since they work long hours at minimum wage jobs, so they end up spending the least amount of time cooking, and they end up making garbage and addictive frozen foods. Or they buy some McDonald\u2019s every now and then.",
            "They have pros who can make them balanced meals and healthier snacks. Also, they are able to afford everything a kid needs for extracurricular activities.\nSo, these kids are likely more active and have access to healthier food choices.",

            "Fat kids = cheap food.\n\nRich kids can afford to eat healthy food\n\nThese days, people are more likely to get fat from eating cheap food that's loaded with junk and empty calories.",
            "Rich people are marketed healthier foods and lifestyles than those in the working classes. When was the last time you saw a multi millionaire go to macdonalds for dinner? The wealthy can afford to be healthy. One aspect in my mind anyway.",
            "Cheapest, easiest and quickest to prepare food is fast food and prepackaged meals.\n\nRich people don't have the issued that require them to seek that kinda thing.\n\nWhen I was young my single mom didn't really have time to cook, so prepackaged foods, the dollar menu and 7/11 were frequent meals along with the occasional free pizza that would last a few days.\n\n\nThere are rich people with fat kids tho, they tend to be the super spoiled kids or the kids that the parents were too busy to watch often.",

            "1.  Healthier diet.\n\n\n2.  More things to do to keep you busy. \n\n\n3. The fat rich kids don't go to the beach, they have other things more important to them to do.",
            "The cheapest food is also the most fattening. Obesity can often be the result of just not being able to afford anything but McDonalds dollar menu items.\n\nPersonally I want the impoverished people to stop eating McDonalds and start eating the guests at this private beach of yours. Two birds with one stone.",
            "I love how easy it is to spot the people who have been lucky enough to think this is some kind of choice and are so certain it\u2019s just laziness, but are the same people who have never heard of a \u201cfood desert\u201d",

There are neighborhoods in the United States where the \u201cgroceries\u201d people have access to are \u2026 pretty much what you find in the snack aisle of the gas station.  A lot of the United States does not have easy access to healthy food unless they can drive, own a car and afford gas, and that excludes a lot of working class people.  If you do not have a grocery store within a mile of your house, you are in a food desert.",
            "Because rich people can afford healthy food.  Healthy food always seems to cost 2-4x what unhealthy food costs.",
            "You mean someone with unlimited access to healthcare, sunshine, outdoor activities, wealth, social hierarchy, outstanding education can and will live a healthy lifestyle? Amazing observation.",

            "I just wanted to be clear, just because you don't see something yourself doesn't mean it doesn't exist. The question implies rich people don't have fat kids, but they definitely do, just at lower rates. Income has a huge correlative effect on obesity but it doesn't mean it doesn't exist for rich people. I'd also argue you don't know the income level of people on the public beach.\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/childhood.html",
            "More highly-processed food is often much cheaper than healthier options like fruits and vegetables. Poorer people also work different job types than rich people and fast food is more easily accessible for themselves and their families when cooking a healthy meal at home isn\u2019t feasible. A more well off family is more likely to go to a nicer restaurant with more high quality ingredients. Take your pick of any of these things.",
            "Food education and what to eat have a lot to do with the free market as well. There are corporations who will tell you something false to sell their product.  Eggs have been around for centuries, feeding people for centuries, but it was only when breakfast cereal started getting made that eggs were bad for us.  \n\nThere are too many false claims in the industry to know what's good and bad. \n\nPoor folks are forced to feed their kids processed foods. Whole foods with the protiens and fats and nutrients needed to maintain weight cost more money. Processed foods lack those items. Thus, poor kids are fatter.",
            "Because they afford healthy food or lipo, and probably a personal trainer if they wanted, and health care\u2026basically it comes down to they are rich. Lol",
            "I JUST made this observation yesterday! My husband and I are middle (maybe upper middle) class. We joined a bougie swim club for the summer, in lieu of a family vacation. I said to him yesterday \u201cyou can tell everyone here is rich because none of them are fat\u201d. \n\nMy 7 year old also goes to a local private school. I grew up in a VERY poor rural area. The two major differences I observed:\n- these kids are kept not just active, but busy. They are not coming home to an empty house and eating pizza bagels and playing video games. They\u2019re on the lacrosse team, the soccer team. They take karate and golf and tennis and drawing and computer coding and horseback riding lessons. They go to after school tutoring. They go to summer camps, plural. \n- Most of the families I know personally have two parents. Even if they are both working full time, the family has plenty of leisure time because no parents work evenings or weekends except the physicians. They pay to have groceries delivered and have plenty of time to cook balanced meals and meal prep for the week. No last second McDonalds runs. \n- they have a village, or if they don\u2019t they pay for one. Involved grandparents and extended families, babysitters and nannies. All that adds to the family\u2019s leisure time. \n\nBasically, they are not operating in survival mode. This is very different from the area where I grew up. Even 20 years ago it was $400 just to play a school sport, not including equipment. Many parents worked nights and weekends and couldn\u2019t take kids to lessons, even if they could afford it. They didn\u2019t have a ton of time to cook so there was a lot of microwaving meals or fast food. \n\nTL;DR the rich have the resources to make better choices.",
            "Bad quality, low calorie foods are cheap. Also, more likely the parents don\u2019t have the same knowledge. Pretty sad.",
            "Wealthier people can afford gym membership and personal trainers and after school activities",

You will save more money and never miss a payment. \n- [ ] Every morning set your intentions and follow though. It\u2019s easier to hit a target if you know what you are aiming at. \n- [ ] No more than 8 hours of sleep of sleep every night. More sleep doesn\u2019t mean you will be more rested. \n- [ ] Understand the law of diminishing returns. Too much of anything is a bad thing. Ying/Yang\n- [ ] Almost everything you need is within yourself. The rest will fit into a large suitcase. \n- [ ] Ask questions! Learn everything you can from everyone you can. Everyone has something to offer. Asking people questions will typically flatter them. Everyone likes to feel important. Win/Win. \n- [ ] Keep up with your calendar. Life can get busy. I\u2019m really bad at this. Yay room for improvement. \n- [ ] To retain innocence, reduce judgments \n- [ ] If friends and family ask to borrow money consider it given away. If you need repayment you can\u2019t afford to lend it anyway.",
