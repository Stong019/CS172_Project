            "Since everybody is going Looney Tunes, I'll try my best to be real. \n\nSome countries have rulers. The people don't choose them and have no say. That's an easy one to figure out. \n\nOther countries, the ones I assume you're talking about, elect their leaders. \n\nIn places where leaders are elected, rich people and businesses use their money to support the campaigns of the people who are beneficial to their interests. \n\nAlso, people, in general, don't know shit about politics, and don't care. They find a group that agrees with them on a few things that are important to them, and that's what they vote for. \n\nThose groups usually have a few very agreeable positions to earn votes, and they have many fucked up positions to continue to earn money from donations. \n\nBecause of all this, the organization can continue to rake in money and receive support, while actively working against the majority of their supporters.\n\nEdit since this blew up: I am completely aware that I did not represent every government and oversimplified the ones that I did.

            "I'm from Kenya, and if I may be honest, majority of the population here do not understand the functions of government e.g. the different arms and their roles. Most, I believe, don't even understand why we have a government in the first place. I can't blame them because the way governments are structured post-colonization is different from how we organized ourselves in our small tribal, societies pre-colonization.\n\nMost of the people look at politicians as celebrities and don't even hold them accountable for failures related to their job descriptions. Instead, most care about their wealth, tribe and popularity. We currently have an MP who was caught by CCTV cameras inside a club (_which had been shut down but this is another different story on its own_) shooting the DJ after an argument ensued. The video made rounds on news media outlets and social media, but nothing is yet to be done. He still holds his sit as MP and even streams live on social media to tutor kids who are currently at home because of the pandemic, on various subjects. The DJ survived, but is currently paralysed from his neck downwards.\n\nNow, you may wonder how this man is still MP with a video of him attempting murder doing the rounds. I wonder too. A lot of Kenyans wonder this too. However, he still freely roams around his constituency meeting his constituents who seem to still adore him & even mingles with / hangs around \"powerful\" politicians e.g. his party leader and even the president (at political rallies pre-corona).\n\nSee, you might think that the most important thing to ALL Kenyans should be having a functional government void of corruption, that works in our favour to improve our quality of life. \n\nHowever, you'd be surprised by how, with a huge, illiterate, tribalistic population, these basic expectations no longer matter and that MOST Kenyans just don't care about things beyond their tribes, cultures and religion when it comes to government and holding government officials accountable.\n\nI can't explain it in simple words because there are so many things that go into it, but what I can say is, you'd think fighting corruption would be at the top of the list for most citizens, right? Well, I'm sorry to say, but it just isn't.",

            "I can only speak for the US but here's what I've gathered:\n1. Most people only vote every 4 years, in the Presidential election. There are midterms (deciding federal and state senators/representatives, some state governors, state proposals etc) every 2 years, and there are also local elections every year (city and county elections for positions like Mayor, sheriff, treasurer, councilmen, and local proposals like millages or new ordinances). This causes problems because the president unfairly bears the weight of every american's happiness in every facet of their life, despite the president actually having fairly little control over how cities or states handle a given problem. Nothing changes locally because *no one votes locally*\n2. The majority of voters are not wealthy. Many people in this country have to work overtime or work multiple jobs to make ends meet. They also have to manage all the other aspects of their lives (kids, parents, bills, medical issues, the broken dishwasher) and unfortunately there isn't very much time left to stand in line at the polls and cast a ballot, let alone research candidates and proposals to ensure you're voting in your best interest. \n3. For many positions, there are no term limits. This means that a person can hold office for *decades*. We often worry about what good/bad things a president can do for the country in 2 term (8 years total), but we think nothing of the senator or representative that's been in office for 24 years. The lack of term limits in addition to the practice of voting for names that we recognize causes elected officials to become content and comfortable in their position; they know that the likelihood of them getting voted out is low. They have no real incentive to make lasting changes. \n\nThere's a lot I'm probably leaving out, but these are IMO 3 of the biggest reasons.\n\nEdit: thank you for the silver! My first award ever!

            "Because nobody wants to really rock the boat, and the only way to do it is if we all join together; which we won't, ever. We are all so preoccupied with ourselves, our ego, the materialistic world, etc etc. We live our lives independently and we don't usually come face to face with real world issues, it's all only on the news. Therefore, we sit back and watch, glued to the television, then go about our lives. Going to work, school, going out, partying, just living. We are all aware of how corrupt it all is, but it's easier to just ignore it and do what you want in your life. Nobody really cares. We all got the illusion of freedom of choice, and can keep busy with technology, and entertainment. Meanwhile, we're all caught up in our differences and hating each other for no real reason.

            "In Denmark we have publicly funded democratic elections. We also have one of the worlds lowest level of corruption. This social system comes with other benefits too; no one pays for medical expenses, educations arent just free, students receive a monthly income. And yes the level of education is also ranking high. I fail to see why this type of system is not demanded by all people if not for the benefits, then perhaps for the low level of corruption.\n\nI am not saying there isn\u2019t any corruption at all. Usually though when it happens, our news agencies have a tendency to make sure it gets the people\u2019s attention, maybe because we are not bombarded constantly by insignificant idiocracy and our laws actually demand all news to be fact checked and unbiased.\n\nI truly love traveling and meeting people in any country, however it\u2019s demoralizing to see how some struggle under the weight of their leaders ability to bleed their country for personal benefits or in the interests of friends and/or corporations. I am not all to optimistic on this part, but it would be great to one day see a world where governments are truly for the people, by the people within this path we\u2019ve chosen of capitalism. Guess though morals have always been for sale - just a matter of figures being high enough and it makes sense in some ways since we all strive for just a little bit better, though some will never be satisfied.\n\nThis time around a new way of corruption seems to have taken hold, which is that when a leader is openly corrupt but uses peoples own identity against them. Like if your a democrat then to the republicans all you do is spread lies and vice versa. In-between these lines a leader and anyone in power is free to do whatever as the people are too busy to fight over who is right and who is wrong. Maybe not a new tactic but it is utilized to the extreme and it really works perfectly.\n\nEdit: sry for the rant! To answer your question I believe corruption is part of any society and would claim it usually sits at an level tolerated by it\u2019s inhabitants. Maybe someone will dispute this? It\u2019s an inherent part of having power and can be an effective tool to both get and keep high ranking positions. Most people either feel too low a status to do much or too comfortable to engage or for a small percentage they benefit and thus have a reason to keep the current structure. This is also why most demonstrators are usually young university students, who are idealistic, not burden with materialistic needs or too comfortable in family, loans, jobs and such. They feel the spark of fighting a corrupt system, one that\u2019ll either break the people in power or themself into submission - to rare has it been the former.",

            "I\u2019m Filipino and the government there is probably one of the most governments. I was born there and moved to America when I was 10 so living in two very different countries gives me a unique perspective. \n\nI think corruption in the Philippines is so bad because it\u2019s part of the culture. I\u2019ve noticed that a lot of Filipinos don\u2019t have respect for authority. People generally don\u2019t follow the rules. People never come on time, people litter everywhere, skipping lines is normal, cops aren\u2019t feared, people build houses on the sidewalks, etc. \n\nNow on to the government itself. When someone is a politician, it means they\u2019re rich rich. And the longer they\u2019ve been in politics, the richer they get. Why? Because for every funding they all get cuts. This starts at the very top and trickles down to the lowest positions. Even then, for congress/senate, the lawmakers don\u2019t really get a say in what they decide. They have to agree to their party because if they don\u2019t they wouldn\u2019t have been able to run in the first place. They also would get funding taken away from them which means they lose all the money they spent on elections.\n\nAnd speaking of elections, you know vote-buying? It\u2019s a literal term in the Philippines where people line up and receive money from candidates in exchange for a promise of their vote. This means that only those who are wealthy can run for office. Imagine in my hometown, which is a smaller developing city. The winning candidate for governor spent $17 million, and donations never count much usually,in just one election to win. And he earned it back in less than a year.... That\u2019s an incredible amount of money especially in pesos. \n\nAnd those wealthy politicians? Well their children are succeeding them. It\u2019s extremely common to have family members in other positions for the same area. This ensures that they continue the \u201cfamily business.\u201d Politicians and their families are seen as royalty in their respective areas. They\u2019re followed around by military (usually because they\u2019re extremely wealthy and are targets for kidnapping) and are seen as local celebrities. \n\nI think one of the main reasons the government system allows itself to be corrupt is that higher ups choose the government workers. For example, the governor is responsible for the public departments (ex education, constructions, hospitals/clinics, etc.) within the province (again imagine it like a state). This means that whenever there\u2019s a new governor, all these positions are wiped out, maybe not completely but can be if the governor decides to. So new teachers, new doctors, new assistants, new everyone. And these people have to be loyal to their governor. Therefore, they have complete control over every decision that needs to be decided. \n\nSo why can governments be openly corrupt? It\u2019s because it is systematically allowed to, at least in the Philippines, due to the complete control politicians have in a giant web of network. Starting from the Congress/senate and president, they have ties to local governments and thus all the public affairs in the smallest minuscule capacity that ensures absolute cooperation and loyalty. This corrupt system has been going on forever and to be in politics means playing in their own game. I personally think there\u2019s no fix in the corruption of the Philippine government. They would have to burn it all down and restart from scratch. \n\n\nP. S. I can\u2019t believe I wrote an entire essay on Filipino corruption. I guess I\u2019ve been inspired while being stuck here in the Philippines and having to experience how the government handled the pandemic.",
            "I think the issue dates back more than people in this chat are addressing. People are saying the root of the problem is \"because the system allows for lobbying\" or \"because the government is corrupt,\" which are both unfortunately 100% true. \n\nThe only thing wrong with these statements is that they are not addressing root problems, they are addressing outcomes of the root problems.\n\nThe problems are not the rules (lobbying and loopholes) but the mindsets that still exist with us today that led to the creating of the shitty rules.\n\nPeople are so mesmerized by luxury/getting rich that we are all are willing to try to get rich with everything we've got! The majority of Americans (without pushback) work unapologetic 9-5 jobs, gamble in the lottery, we defend our billionaires publicly with \"he earned his money,\" we vote based on our economy instead of our cumulative quality of life, i mean shit dude besides Dubai there is nowhere on earth that caters as well on such a big scale to rich people. And the reason so many people are still defending this shit is because they wanna be rich and powerful too, so they won't trash the guys who already are!\n\nYou and I living our lives based around money is what is creating the society that breeds greedy corruption like that in our government.\n\nThe problem is less that the rules are forcing us into a corner, it is moreso us that are doing it to each other by blindly chasing our desires for power and greed. The politicians corrupting our system at the top are our friends, family, and neighbors, meaning YOUR friends families and neighbors could be corrupted too if given political power, and probably much easier than you'd imagine.\n\nI think the solution these days is not to try to enact change by again changing the rules, but to plan to eventually change the rules to reflect an improved society - we need to change each other and ourselves before anything ever truly changes for humanity. We have got to talk each other out of wanting to be rich and powerful, we've gotta get rid of that twinkle in our eyes for cokparative superiority, and we have to realize that us as a human species is more important than any of us individually. \n\nThe written rules of law reflect the unspoken rules of society - WE have to change for the better before we can change our laws to protect/reflect us.",

            "Corruption is actually my area of research. There are really a few questions wrapped up in here. One of them is, \"why do people vote for corrupt politicians?\" \n\nPeople vote for corrupt politicians for a few reasons. First, they don't know the politician is corrupt. It's one thing to think generally there is a lot of corruption, but another to think that my specific representative is corrupt. This is even more true recently with the decline in the trust in the media. Second, research shows people are less likely to vote for a politicians they know to be corrupt, but it's not the only factor. Would you change your vote in the upcoming US presidential election if you saw prof your preferred candidate had offered government contracts to whichever company gave him a big donation. I wouldn't. I wouldn't like it but I hate the other guy so much it wouldn't switch my vote. Third, people may expect benefits for voting for a corrupt politician. There was a famous Brazilian politician who used to run on the slogan, \"he steals but he gets things done.\" We see this more in countries with more clientelistic systems of elections, but the same principal can apply broadly. I don't like that my politicians steals but if he's elected I'll get the new school, or hospital, or tax cut. \n\nThere is also research that shows that corruption essentially turns voters off. If people think there is a lot of corruption they may leave the political process, actually making corruption something of an electoral strategy.\n\nBut I think another key answer to the questions is that people get punished for corruption all the time. Yes, there are lots of corrupt leaders, but there are also lots who have been brought down by corruption. Some of the most consistent and long-running authoritarian regimes in the world, (Mexico, Malaysia) were brought down significantly over issues of corruption. The Arab Spring was kicked off by an issue of corruption that toppled the Tunisian government. If you're talking about the US Donald Trump, who is more nakedly corrupt than any president in living memory is currently way way down in the polls. \n\nCountries also reform themselves all the time. The US has issues with corruption, but nothing compared to a hundred years ago. Look up the corruption issues 70 years ago in most Northern European countries that now do so well.",

Corruption, homelessness, poverty, even illness, are all something we could remove if we as a society decided to. But we don't.\n\nPart of the issue here is to battle ANY systemetic problem, a lot of people have to act against their own immediate interests. Imagine you're a politician, and you're had it with corruption. You're going to rebel against the lobbyists that prop you up, so you shoot them down. You call out corruption wherever you see it, you try and clean house...and all of the politicians who do have their lobbyist money squash you.\n\nOkay, so you're a politician who wants to combat corruption, and you try telling all the OTHER politicians to band together to combat corruption. If you ALL agree to even the playing field, surely things will get better, right? You have two problems here: One, if some people claim to agree and don't, the ones who are still corrupt will have the resources to crush you. And two, every politician benefits from claiming to be against corruption, even if they aren't. So there's no way to for anyone to tell that you're serious.\n\nIn any situation where you need a bunch of people to agree to do something that hurts them slightly to get change it becomes really hard to make progress. Even if I really care about the thing, I have to trust that \\_other\\_ people care enough to make my actions worth it.",

            "I would argue this is due to everything being so abstracted away on a daily basis for most people. For example, in the US, it is easy to go about your day without thinking about how the actions of the President affect you. On a daily basis, generally it never will. However, in the long run, things that are not easy topics, such as Foreign Affairs, become more noticeable. On top of that, the denigration of public education and a general lack of critical thinking skills generally puts people at a disadvantage when it comes to determining what is proper policy. You have huge swaths of the US where kids get great educations. But then you go a few blocks down the street, you're struggling with basic supplies. Those kids then grow up and become ignorant of the world around them and have no faculties to process what's happening in Washington. That, on top of lack of basic social services, wages not keeping up with inflation, high cost of health care and education, keeps people in a perpetual cycle of just surviving. It's hard to pay attention to all the complicated matters facing our nation when you're dealing with a job that barely pays living wages, you have a hospital bill for $8,000 because you don't have universal health care like every other industrialized nation, and your kid needs new clothes for the school year.",
            "A lot of commenters have pretty good responses, that get to part of the reasoning but ultimately I think this is a simple answer. More so than people being indifferent to politics or anything like that, the State has a monopoly on Violence. The police, the military, and they have the authority to utilize that violence to protect their interests. It's pretty hard to take action to unseat a corrupt government when you're confronted with a militarized police force and the looming threat of even more serious threats, like UAVs. add that to the fact that United States society(and many others) is(are) structured so that people most negatively impacted by the corrupt government are either misled by propaganda or are too poor to take the time away from working to participate. It's hard to care about politics if you might not be able to feed yourself because you missed work to Caucus, and a Caucus is a far cry from actually unseating an exploitative government. Ultimately, I think the answer is centered around fear. Either fear of violent reprisal by state sanctioned police/military.

There's also tons of work that goes into attempts at reform/pressure on a less noticeable level. \n\nI guess maybe what you're expecting is that people would not allow corruption to go on for so long as they do with so many governments. I think to answer such a question, you'd have to look at the historical context for one thing. Not all countries are in the same situation. Some countries can be so bad off that the language and education used makes the citizens next to illiterate about the realities of the problems they're facing. Even in the US, which one would think people are literate about \"freedom\" and \"liberty,\" there's a lot of purposeful illiteracy about, for example, the country's history of couping other countries for BS reasons, or just how politics works and how to organize and get power. \n\nSometimes half the battle is just getting people to a point where they understand, to some degree, what they're up against and what kind of options they have for taking it on. From there, you have to do a lot lot lot of tireless organizing and you need to have demands or policy goals that are mostly on the same ideological page.

I've unplugged appliances and such, done my laundry, cleaned up, took the trash out, made sure my bills are good until I'm out, no food thats gonna expire while im gone. Is there anything simple I may have forgotten?\n\nEdit: HI everyone, I'm back! I'll do a detailed update after work, but overall it was incredibly boring. I have plenty more to share but all in all, 2/10 don't recommend\n\nEdit 2: Well I already typed this out once and accidentally deleted it, so sorry for the delay. I'll start off by saying jail is not very fun that's for sure. So after I made this post, before it blew up, I did a last check of my apartment, made sure my bills were good and I had someone to check on my place. My sister came and picked me up around noon, we got a bit high and went to watch Across the Spider-Verse (10/10, loved it). After that we hit up the Wendy's by the jail for my proverbial last supper. Honestly I was very anxious so I had to pretty much how force myself to eat it, but I'm glad I did. I turned myself in at exactly 6:00pm to the jail. Initially they didn't even know I was supposed to show up, but they got that squared away pretty quickly. First they had me sign some paperwork and get a little medical check up, just vitals and some questions. Next they had me strip down and take a shower, they gave me some anti lice shampoo that made my scalp and body incredibly cold. Next they gave me my jail clothes and had me go through a full body scan to make sure I wasn't carrying drugs in my prison wallet. They give orange jumpsuits to inmates who have been arrested, but are awaiting court, gray to inmates who have been sentenced (me), and white clothes to the workers. Workers have their clothes and towels changed out every day, while everyone else got them switched on Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday. They also gave us new sheets on Sundays. After I was dressed and clean enough, they sent me back to the \"intake dorm\" so to speak. This was a room with 24 cells in it, 12 on top, 12 on bottom. There was a common area with 6 tables and a TV, as well as a pull up bar that you could also do dips on. This specific jail doesn't have outside recreation time anymore because the state says a pull up bar is enough to count as recreation time. So basically I was inside a room with nearly no windows for my sentence. My cell here was about 12 feet long and 7 feet wide. It had a sink, toilet, and a desk in it. The \"bed\" was a metal rack with about an inch of foam to lay on. We didnt get pillows, but we got 2 sheets and a wool blanket that was very itchy. I used the wool blanket as my pillow and covered up with a sheet, while using the other sheet to act as a barrier between me and the foam. Luckily for me I am a very warm sleeper, because the jail was kept very cold at all times. Since the intake dorm is a medium security block, we had to lockdown in our cells from 1pm-3pm, as well as 9pm-6am everyday. At 6am sharp, they turn all of the lights on and announce \"head count\" on the speaker. This means I had to get out of my bed and go stand by the cell door while the guards came around and made sure no one escaped over night. If you didn't get out of bed they locked you in your cell for 24 hours until the next morning. After that I would lay back down and try to sleep until breakfast came at 7am. Breakfast was generally cereal with milk, peanut butter with toast, and either apple or orange juice. The food menu was the same every week, I'll post that somewhere down below. After breakfast I always went back to my cell to lay down and try to get some sleep, but the intake dorm was incredibly loud. People couldn't seem to have a conversation without yelling, people were playing dominoes and cards from 6am to 9pm slapping them on the table, no one had any respect for other people basically because it's a bunch of literal criminals who just got to jail. Not to mention how bright the lights were. What I'm saying is there wasn't many nap opportunities in that block. Since I couldn't sleep much I read my books (library was every Wednesday morning, luckily my first morning there. Could check out 4 books), brushed up on my spades and rumi skills, learned how to play tonk, played a bit of poker too. I played some chess, and lost a game to an old man. I was thinking all day about how bad I wanted to play him again, only for him to get released right after dinner. I still want that rematch Randy. Sometime before lunch I would shower. In this dorm there were 2 separate single person showers. They were very small, and way too hot. Don't even THINK about stepping foot in there without your sandals on. Also don't touch the walls. Or the curtain. Basically don't touch anything but the button that makes water come out, the showers were nastier than any shower I've had to use in my many many years playing hockey. This includes the multiple showers with literal shit on the floor.\u00a0 I managed to not drop the soap too, a skill I've been honing all my life. Now, I went in on a Tuesday night and immediately put in a commissary order of shampoo, conditioner, soap, toothpaste, some Ramen, some candy, you get it, the essentials. I got all of that on Thursday morning which was nice, until I realized I forgot to buy deodorant, yay :) I'm very about my personal hygiene, and commissary didn't come again until the next Tuesday, so that was a rough week for me. Honestly it didn't make much of a difference, since half of the people in there didn't shower or brush their teeth at all, making the dorm smell.. unique to put it lightly. The toothbrush they give to the inmates is a grand total of 2 inches long, which meant I had to basically deepthroat my fingers two or three times a day to clean my teeth. Not a good look in jail. The reason is so no shanks could be made, but they gave us a very long very hard plastic spoon that could stab someone perfectly well, so I call bullshit. Anyway, after all that, lunch came around 12pm. We would eat and lounge about some more until 1pm when they locked us in our cells. From 1pm-3pm it was generally pretty quiet since everyone was in their own space, so naturally I slept as much as I could, because why would I want to be conscious in jail when I don't have to be? When 3pm came around they did head count again, and again if you weren't fully dressed by your cell door they would lock you in your cell for 24 hours. I never had that happen but I sure witnessed it happening plenty. Usually it was because someone was withdrawaling from drugs or they were understandably depressed about being incarcerated. After that we would do the same shit, just waiting around until more food came. Dinner was sometime between 5:30 and 6pm. I guess ill post the food menu here since you're all dying to know. I'll preface that by saying the county jail that I went to has a reputation, unbeknownst to me, for actually having good food compared to other jails in my state. I would compare it to the school lunches I got in high school, not amazing but it was edible, and for that I feel lucky. So here's the menu\n\nMonday: Breakfast- sausage and cheese McMuffin (delicious), hash brown, juice, milk.\nLunch- Mac and cheese (not bad), either cucumber salad or zucchini, milk. \nDinner- sloppy Joe with a biscuit (eh), peas and carrots, bread and butter\n\nTuesday: Breakfast- froot loops, peanut butter and toast, juice, milk.\nLunch- cheese pizza (cardboard) breadstick, salad, milk\nDinner- meatball sub (pretty good), a random vegetable\n\nWednesday: Breakfast- cheerios, peanut butter and toast, juice, milk.\nLunch- cheeseburger (good), fries (bad), cucumber salad, milk.\nDinner- vegetable soup (tasted good but it was literally 6 spoonfuls of soup), celery and carrots, bread and butter\n\nThursday: Breakfast- egg and cheese bagel\nLunch- grilled cheese (6 fuckin pieces of unmelted cheese), tomato soup, crackers, milk. \nDinner- turkey (rubbery, but decent) with stuffing, gravy, peas, bread and butter\n\nFriday: Breakfast- corn flakes, peanut butter and toast, juice, milk.\nLunch- chicken tacos (delicious), zucchini, milk\nDinner- polish sausage, mashed potatoes, gravy, green beans, bread and butter\n\nSaturday: Breakfast- \"pancakes\" with syrup, hard boiled egg, juice, milk. They were not good pancakes\nLunch- hot dog, baked beans, tater tots, milk\nDinner- don't remember\n\nSunday: Breakfast- rice bran, peanut butter with toast, juice, milk. \nLunch- don't remember\nDinner- rice and chicken with some sort of brown sauce. Not BBQ, wasn't bad, A vegetable, bread and butter.\n\nAll of the meat was turkey or chicken.\n\nAfter dinner we did a whole lot of nothing until 9pm when they locked us down. My block actually had 1 inmate who was waiting to be sentenced on an arson charge with attempted murder tacked on there, so he wasn't allowed around other inmates and was on 23 hour lock down. His 1 hour of free time was from 9pm-10pm when we were locked in our cells and oh my, this guy was a fuckin nut. He drank the cleaning products, are trash off the floor, walked around naked one night, harassed everyone else, and was just generally very entertaining to all of the other very bored inmates. We called him Charlie because he was basically Charles Manson Jr. I do not miss that guy. Anyway at 10pm they turned the lights off, but it never actually gets dark in jail. This posed a problem for me, because I have serious trouble falling asleep as it is. So I would read until I got sleepy enough, then use my shirt to cover my eyes and doze off. Usually I was pretty hungry at bed time so I would eat a Ramen before I brushed my teeth. There wasn't a microwave in the intake dorm so I would fill my bowl of noodles with warm water, until the noodles got soft. Then I would dump that water out and put new warm water in and mix in the seasoning. The cells sink water only got to about 100-110 degrees so it wasn't very good, but it was food so I'm not complaining. The food they served us was good enough, but there was never very much of it so I had to make due with what I had. For reference I'm 5\"11' and about 165lbs. I've always been active and have a physically engaging job, so I eat a bit more and burn more calories. I would end up falling asleep some time around 1 or 2am most days until 6am when it started all over again. After a week in there they finally moved me back to the minimum security dorm. This was a room about the size of a gymnasium with much lower ceilings. There were a total of 78 beds, 19 bunk beds on the back wall, with 2 rows of 20 single beds just in front of them. There was a communal bathroom with 3 urinals, 3 toilets (and cleaner to use before every movement), and 6 shower heads. Despite the 6 showers we could only use 1 at a time, apparently with the exception of the one guy who just hopped in there with me for a few minutes, cleaned, and went about his day. Like I said I've played hockey for many years and showered with a lot of other guys, so I just treated it the same way and neither of us acknowledged the other. There was a guard desk with a guard in there 24/7. 95% of the time the guards were scrolling tiktok or playing online poker, paying no attention to the inmates, and even less attention to the showers that were 25 feet away from them. The other 5% they would walk from bunk to bunk looking for stashes of fruit or unmade beds. We had a couple shakedowns (where they tear the whole place up looking for contraband), nothing really came of them though. The intake dorm also had a vending machine stocked with Ramen, candy, other sweets like honeybuns and cinnamon rolls and things of that nature, pop (soda for you nonmidwesterners), coffee, sugar, you get the idea. A \"Commissary to go\" machine if you will. Everything from the vending machine was also less expensive ($1 for Ramen instead of $1.40, $2.55 for pop instead of $2.85, etc). There was also 2 microwaves and 2 TVs, 1 TV always on ESPN or some other sports channel, the other on a movie or show. The minimum dorm also didn't lock down from 1pm-3pm, and didn't lock down at night until 10pm. So while you sacrificed privacy, the microwave and vending machine were too good to pass up, so everyone stayed in there. Oh also the cot you slept on was actually somewhat comfortable,\u00a0 as much as foam on a metal rack can be I guess. All of the workers stayed here as well as most non violent offenders who weren't a nuisance. There were a couple fights in here though, and the people involved got immediately sent to the hole (yes, it's a real thing). Basically a cell with no TV, no other people, no commissary, basically nothing at all but your thoughts and the occasional tray of food to tell what time it is. I luckily did not have to check it out for myself. The days went by the same way in minimum, except I didn't get a nap time from 1-3pm, so I got even less sleep in there. I did however get to read more books, so it wasn't all bad. The only things to do were sleep, eat, read, play cards, maybe a little chess if you're feelin froggy that day, or sit on a metal seat and watch TV. The seats were unbearable for more than an hour. A lot of people also walked laps or did pull ups on the bullshit machine that was supposed to be our recreation area. Did I mention we weren't allowed outside? Yeah I'm still a bit salty about that so I'll say it again. There were phones in each dorm to use. After your 1 free call, using the phone cost 21 cents per minute, which is damn expensive so I used it sparingly. There was a guy who was arrested on some crazy drug trafficking charges in there (2kgs of cocaine, $25,000 in cash) awaiting his trial. He used the phone for 8 HOURS A DAY.\u00a0 I am not exaggerating. He also didn't speak a lick of English and would sometimes start screaming into the phone. He actually got sent back to the secure dorms because he missed headcount.. because he was on the phone. I feel like there's a lot I'm missing, and it'll all come to me later, but for now I'll wrap it up. Jail is not a fun place to be, never has been, never will be. That said I deserved it, and I did the time. Lastly stay positive, life is too short to spend it any other way.",

Don't be weird about stuff, go with the flow and you'll be fine. Try to get along with your new roomie, it makes things much easier. I spent my time play fighting with a dude 3x my size and it was fucking hilarious. \n\nNot sure how it works with your system but if appropriate, give someone you trust a small amount of money to send in if you need it and keep their contact details handy. \n\nOn your last day, remember that not everyone is getting out, and some are never leaving. Don't be *too* happy about leaving, just keep it zipped and keep moving.",

            "Write down phone numbers. Pick your big 3. The ones you know that will answer the phone. No point in waiting an hour plus on the phone to not have a conversation. \n\nI\u2019d bring about $200 maybe a little more for commissary. Shit can get expensive in there and you won\u2019t have to worry about deadlines to load your account again. \n\nAs far being inside goes\n\nBe prepared to be annoyed. It is very loud in a dorm. A lot of people sleep all day so they\u2019re up all night. The sheriffs deputies will fuck with you. 3 am standing head count, lights on at 6 am, the lights also never fully go out and are usually right above the bunks. Just roll with the bullshit. Don\u2019t let other people spazzing out make you think it\u2019s okay. Expect bullshit so it won\u2019t come as a surprise. \n\nYou\u2019ll have rowdy people in there that like to cause/start shit. You don\u2019t have to be and usually won\u2019t be a part of it if you\u2019re chill and mind your business. If there is a fight, you\u2019ll usually see everyone flocking towards it or start taking laps around the pod to watch. Just go to your bunk. In my county they can charge you for watching fights. In my county you also get an inciting a riot in a penal institution charge for fighting. Fighting a gang member gets you a state R.I.C.O even if you don\u2019t gang bang. You can be scared but don\u2019t look scared. Just breathe and try to relax the muscles in your face. In 30 days there\u2019s inevitably gonna be someone that tries you up. Don\u2019t go for it. Don\u2019t give a speech. Just tell them you\u2019re not here to get into any bullshit, you\u2019re doing your time and getting the fuck on. Carry yourself like a man, don\u2019t be cocky. \n\nTry to talk with the people a little so most of the pod knows who you are. Pick and choose who you have real conversations with. Pick and choose who you talk to at all and who is more or less co worker status having surface level conversations. \n\nBest thing for you to do to pass time is gonna be working out. I used to start around noon and go until chow. Eat, shower and play cards until lights out at 11pm. If you\u2019re religious at all, find the people that get the little \u201cdaily bread\u201d books or have a Bible, read with them if they\u2019re cool with it or part of a group that reads and discusses it. \n\nIn my county showers only run certain hours of the day. MAKE SURE you are in that rotation both times they run. Everyday. Jail is a dirty ass place and you also don\u2019t want to be one of the people in there smelling like ass. That will get you into some shit. \n\nDon\u2019t go up to the windows looking into other pods, much as you see it happening. \n\nPeople might be in there smoking K2, cheeking pills if they get the mental meds etc. Dont engage. Don\u2019t support anybody doing it. Dont let anybody talk you into it.  Don\u2019t front anybody commissary, don\u2019t gamble. \n\nStay away from the 3 Gs. Gays, Gangs and Gambling. Shit ain\u2019t your business. Jail is not a place of tolerance, inside you cannot be cool or associate with the gays even if you do out here. You will be lumped together and ridiculed/outcast the same as them. \n\nIf something happens in the pod like a fight, tattooing etc and they get caught up, don\u2019t say anything to a deputy. Your name is Bennett and you ain in it. \n\nMake a list of the commissary, the items, their number and the cost. In my county we had to order over the phone and the one sheet with the items was taped on the outside of the pod window. \n\nTry to pick a good bunk mate. You\u2019ll most likely be in an open dorm so it\u2019s free range pretty much. If it\u2019s a crowded pod, look for an open bunk. People might try to fuck with you and tell you they\u2019re full up and make you sleep on the floor. Don\u2019t go for it. One tiers side is usually for the gang members. So avoid that one pretty much at all times. You hear or see one of em doing some dumb shit, don\u2019t look up there. \n\nYou\u2019re gonna run into a couple psych case ass people. People with no hope that turn it into anger. People that are just plain ol stupid. Some people that are actually pretty cool and just have some really shitty habits. You\u2019re not there to preach to anybody about anything kuz at the end of the day you\u2019re both in jail. \n\nJail is jail man. It\u2019s gonna be about as stupid as can possibly be. 30 days doesn\u2019t seem long but it\u2019ll honestly feel like forever sometimes. Try to keep your mind occupied and yourself busy throughout the day. Some days will be better than others. \n\nYour first 7-10 days will probably be in a transitions pod, to help you get used to the feeling. Eventually a deputy will come in to do placement and see where your permanent dorm is gonna be. You probably won\u2019t be able to order commissary in there but they will give you state soap, toothbrush and paste and a towel. It gets cold in the dorm so try to get a sweater. If a friend you make gets bonded out ask for theirs. \n\nAlso. You\u2019re gonna have trouble shitting. The cool offs (state drink mix) they give you has saltpeter in it and it\u2019ll dry your shit up. Drink a cup or two of warm water throughout at the day and that\u2019ll help. \n\nIf you have any questions about what it\u2019s like just pm me. I think I covered a good base but if not just lmk. Good luck man.\n\nEdit: thank you for the gold kind stranger",

            "I do, but it turned out I\u2019m bipolar, autistic, and have ADHD. What this sounds like to me is that you\u2019re having some trouble with being productive - maybe you have something going on like an undiagnosed condition - ADHD, depression, anxiety, executive dysfunction, autism, there are lots of conditions that can make it next-to-impossible to be productive and \u201cdisciplined,\u201d that people often don\u2019t know they have. But you\u2019re determined, so you *try really hard* and *force yourself* to be productive so you can accomplish your goals and be the kind of person you want to be. But this comes at a price. It requires a much higher cognitive load than it should to be able to make yourself perform under those conditions. You\u2019re having to expend twice the mental and emotional energy to do these things, because you\u2019re working against the cognitive deficits caused by whatever condition you\u2019re struggling against. It could be low dopamine, low norepinephrine, low serotonin, too much cortisol, there are all sorts of things that can go wrong with your brain. \n\nBecause you have to exert an unnatural amount of effort to pull off that level of structure and discipline for a few days, because your brain isn\u2019t really in a healthy state to do it, you soon get worn out and just can\u2019t do it anymore. Now you\u2019ve completely drained all your willpower and mental energy, so you don\u2019t even have any left to do even basic things like bathing, so you live like a slob for the next couple days while you recover. It\u2019s kind of like trying to run a race on a broken leg, then *wondering why you can\u2019t walk at all the next day.*\n\nThis has been my *entire life.* I spent my whole life trying so hard to be disciplined. I\u2019d just flip flop from one extreme to the other. I\u2019d give it everything I had and push myself, but since I was working against my ADHD and emotional issues, it took an unnatural amount of effort. Finally I\u2019d just snap and give out. Then I\u2019d be too burned out to do anything for a while. Then repeat the cycle. Then, as an adult, I found out I have ADHD, autism, and bipolar disorder. I never had a chance! I went on medication, which was a huge game-changer. I still struggle, but getting diagnosed and treated was the best thing that ever could have happened to me. It gave me the ability to live a more normal life and do things on a consistent basis I could never do before. \n\nI would strongly suggest getting screened for ADHD, depression, anxiety, executive dysfunction, or autism. Especially with ADHD, there are different types, and not everyone is the stereotypical hyperactive type. Best of luck to you, and I hope you\u2019re able to find yourself in a better place soon!",
            "For me it\u2019s more I do so good for about a week, feel so great I am happy  and all of a sudden the next week or two is bad. Feels like my mind just goes blank and I can\u2019t think or get motivated to do a damn thing. Other than go to work and come home. It\u2019s a scary thing, and when I\u2019m in that slump I miss the other feeling I just can\u2019t get there, even if I try to by like going on a walk or doing something I like. It\u2019s so weird. :(",
            "Ah yes, my work week followed by the weekend.",
            "For me there\u2019s a couple keys to avoiding that cycle. Since you said you were a slob for 2 days and good for a week, I\u2019ll just say you were 20% bad and 80% good for an example. \n \n(I put a TLDR at the bottom)\n\nFirst, I don\u2019t try to be 100% good on my goals every day. It\u2019s just not realistic or even possible honestly. That just leads to having 0% successful days when you inevitably burn out and can\u2019t meet your standards. So in a week, I\u2019ll be something like 80-90% good Monday to Friday and then more like 60-80% on the weekends. Obviously you can tighten that up or adjust based on your needs or how well it\u2019s working. I think this helps me form good habits better while you\u2019re still averaging that same 80% of good over time. It\u2019s also easier to improve incrementally starting there. \n\nAnother thing is recognizing urges and either finding alternatives or satisfying them in moderation. You also should plan this out so it\u2019s not a let down. Like when you\u2019re on a diet, I prefer to have a couple dark chocolate chips when I feel like it instead of just totally cutting out chocolate. When I cut it out entirely, the craving just kind of builds and builds until I just have to have some huge dessert. And then it just gets easier and more satisfying to keep doing it. A few chocolate chips a day fights the craving and is less damaging to my overall goals than buying a cake and some ice cream. Similarly, I might notice I\u2019m really craving a cheeseburger or something. Instead of ignoring that, I might say that if I meet my goals all week, I can have a good burger Friday night and cut back a little more than usual the next day or two. Again, I think if you ignore it, it just builds until you break. Now all a sudden you\u2019ve broken down and feel bad about it so you make a whole weekend of eating poorly. \n\nIt works with other things too, I just struggle the most with eating habits. It could be just cleaning most of the kitchen every week instead of making it spotless or simply taking a shower and brushing your teeth every day but not worrying about shaving, putting on makeup or dressing up daily. Then to my second point, if you feel it stressing you out a little, schedule a day later in the week where you know you won\u2019t do any house work or take care of yourself. Try to clean the house just a little more, and maybe get a haircut and mani/pedi or something like that leading up to that day though. \n\nTLDR: \n\n1) instead of trying to be perfect daily and then being terrible a couple days, try to be more realistic and manageable - maybe like 80% successful every day. \n\n2) plan for moments of indulgence when you are struggling instead of ignoring the urges. It feels better when it\u2019s planned instead of a breakdown and you can compensate for those bad moments in the days leading up to them.",
            "\nI used to go through this all the time. The biggest thing is that having fluctuating days like that kills your progress and momentum\n\nThis basic formula will help you to be very successful and avoid this pitfall.\n\nA. You need to have clarity on your end goal or the direction you want to move.\n\nB.  A simple set of  routine items that are written out that you follow on a consistent basis.\n\nC. A way to reflect daily and weekly on what went well and what didn't and to make the adjustments.\n\nif you just do that you'd be surprised how rapidly you start to move forward in basically every area of your life.\n\n\n##Here is some actionable advice that works for me:\n\n1. write out your goals for the week.\n\n2. Create a morning and evening routine for your work days.  Have it written out or typed out so that you check it off and fill it out each day.  To simplify  I think of it is book ending my days. Therefore regardless of how effective or ineffective my day is in between these two routine items I know that I'm continually moving the ball forward and not letting things fall behind. \n\nA good morning routine sets the tone for the day and increases the probability of a successful outcome, mood, energy.\n\nA good evening routine make sure we measure our progress for the day and make adjustments going forward.\n\neven a fraction of a single percent improvement per week can double your performance output in 18 months. if you keep the routine like this you will be exponentially ahead of where you are today in 18 months.\n\nExample\n\n##Am routine ( M -F )\n\n- wake up same time\n\n- mental gratitude review. Think about the things you're grateful for and imagine not having them or those who currently don't have them. your health is a great example considering their people right now fighting and dying around the world in hospitals gasping for air\n\n- make bed\n\n- no phone or external stimuli for  30 +minutes\n\n- brain dump on a piece of paper for five minutes to clear your mind.\n\n- review the three biggest goals you have.  Think about how great each one's going to feel and step into that. Visualization essentially\n\n- review your daily tasks and visualize yourself going through each one productively and successfully\n\n- hydrate\n\n- something physical even push ups\n\n- listen to five or ten minutes of some music that pumps you up so you get ready to tackle your day with high energy. it helps to shift you into a more focused and sense of urgency mindset\n\n\n## PM routine (M - F)\n\n- organize workspace\n\n- run dishes\n\n- take 5 minutes to do a quick clean-up.\n\n- organize any communications, emails etc\n\n- write out all the little things you did right today. Take a few seconds to celebrate each one.  Even something little as not having that extra cookie, focusing more on the project at hand etc\n\n-  answer this \" is there anything I did today knowing what I know now I wouldn't do again in the future? If so why? \" What will I change so that this doesn't recur?\"\n\n- answer this \"Did I come across anything today that I should learn further so that it will benefit my life?\n\n- answer \" was there anything today that caused me some type of pain? If so why? How can I avoid it in the future\"\n\n-  plan out your next day on paper\n\n- End your day relaxing and doing something you enjoy that's not related to work\n\n\n##Sat Routine\n\n\n- review end of day questions for the week\n\n- review your goals for the week and your progress on each one. look where they went well and where they did not and make adjustments after assessing what was the cause of the success or the failure for the week.\n\n-  do your laundry house cleaning and any other organization items,\n\n- review your finances and spending habits for the week.\n\n- review all your lists of good actions you took during the week towards your goals. celebrate those and know that those are all steps that are moving you towards where you're trying to get to.\n\n\nI'd recommend making a sheet for \n\n1. Your goals each week.\n\n2. Routine each weekday \n\n3. Saturday  sheet. \n\n I would print them out each week and then keep them somewhere in a binder. Filling them out by hand tends to have a more powerful effect in my opinion than if you just store the files digitally.\n\n\nyou may also want to look into the X effect which is a way to assist with this by printing a chart out on your wall and everyday you X off each item you complete correctly.\n\nI have three of them. One for my morning routine one for  my evening routine and one for my intermittent fasting. \n\nReally helps.\n\n\n\nGood luck kick ass.",

            "A lot of great advice here. The only thing I would add is to start small. You don\u2019t have to go from completely off routine to back on routine in the snap of a finger. Just do something. Make your bed. Go for a walk. Stretch. Or just allow yourself to relax and do something you enjoy that may not be productive. Recharge your batteries then start ramping up. Best thing you can do is start something. I find that when I just get started I build momentum and energy to keep going. I\u2019ll maybe only intend to go for a walk the. Next thing I know I get a full workout in. \n\nTo me, our state of mind can gain momentum. If you are in a lazy state of mind it will build momentum and make it hard to stop being lazy. The same is true of activity. Laziness begets laziness, but activity can also bring more activity.",

I'm trying to stay somewhere in the middle rather than being super productive for a while and then doing nothing but lying on the couch for a while after that. I'm trying to get dressed every day and go for short walks and do little amounts of cleaning here and there, even if I don't do anything else. So every day is a little productive rather than only some days being really productive. But I'm also trying not to get too upset with myself if I can't manage those things. So far it seems to be helping and I'm not seeing as huge of a fluctuation between the two but that may change when life goes back to normal.",
            "For me it tends to be the weeks I don\u2019t fold my laundry as soon as it is done. I have just a hamper of clean cloths only it is the same hamper I normally put my dirty cloths.

            "I went a couple of weeks of consistent studying and gym attendance and I was so proud of myself. Then the COVID-19 came along and wiped that right away.",
            "I have gone through that a lot and slowly worked through it. A few mantras or perspectives that help me, these are personal and might not ring true for everyone. I learned these from building up a gym habit and now I apply them to my work and other projects.\n\n1) **20% of perfect gets results.** I used a habit tracker for going to the gym. Over the last 2 years I went about 20% of the time I wanted to, but looking at my start photos and most recent photos and tracking weight I saw that I lost 5 kilos, and kept that off over Christmas.\n\nI got a really good result, even though just looking at how often I hit my goals I was quite down on myself. Doing a week of good work and then bumming around for a couple of days is still doing a week of good work. Try and see it as building up to that consistency, rather than beating yourself up for the gaps. Let's be honest, 20% of perfect in a new habit is still pretty fucking good.\n\n2) **I can feel like shit and be productive.** Some of my gym days I woke up thinking \"Urgh, no way I am going to the gym.\" At first that meant my gym day was gone. But sometimes I got out there and hit the gym anyways. So now (when I could get out to the gym I mean) I can wake up and think \"Urgh, today is gonna be shit, I'm not gonna do anything\" and then think \"But that doesn't mean I have to lay around and not do anything.\"\n\nThinking \"Today is gonna be shit\" isn't what drains me. Beating myself up for thinking that is what drains me. Having a bit of compassion for myself if I'm not in a good mood is what gets me into a good mood.\n\n3) **Small habits support larger ones.** If I get up and start working without having a wash or a decent breakfast then I eventually run out of steam. Now I make sure that I have a wash in the morning and a nice cup of tea. They days I do that, are the days that I am closer to that ideal productive me. So try concentrating on the small things that make you you, and keep you connected to your goal, which is being on top of looking after yourself.\n\n4) **Backtrack to the source.** If getting up and showering is what you want to do, but you only do that 1% of the time, then that's the thing you need to work on. If you wake up thinking you cant be bothered to have a shower, then work out a small step you could take towards that. Wash your face, give yourself a head or face massage in bed. If that works then now that's the habit you want to build everyday. Identify the pillar that is falling down for you and strengthen it. Don't try to be good at everything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMostly it was recognising that I was trying to get better at something important to me. So when I got upset at not being perfect, that's because I am motivated, not because there is something wrong with me. Worrying about failure doesn't mean you are a failure, it means you are trying to find your way to success.",

            "I go through a similar cycle with the same symptoms although it could be a different cause. It took me years, but I finally did find a way to deal with it.\n\nThe productive times are highs or ups, the slob days are lows or downs, and there is a balance in between where you can be stable. The cycle is like hitting a ramp with your bike into a big lake. The more energy you put in by peddling your bike really fast, the higher you will jump but you will always fall back into the lake, and the higher you jump, the deeper you will go into the water. Your goal should be to live at your stable point.\n\nThe lows are your body recovering from squeezing all the energy out of it during your highs. The only time you can fix your behavior is during your highs because during your lows it's almost impossible to do anything.\n\nThe thing I found that helped the most was what I call active meditation. Think of an activity that you can do without any thought or effort where your mind can just wander where it wants. It should be something you enjoy, something that is not stressful, and something that when you think about doing it you don't have to go make yourself do it. For me I found cycling. Walking, yoga, wood carving, painting, etc are other examples.\n\nWhen you do whatever it is, don't go out and do it to try to improve your skill or get a workout in. Go at an easy pace. Let your mind wander wherever it wants to go. This is rest for your mind, and it's how to learn to relax. Your mind and your body are extremely interconnected, so when your body is active and calm your mind cues off of it and gets into the same rhythm.\n\nOnce I could modulate my highs, I found my lows weren't so bad. Once my lows weren't so bad, I found I could do active meditation during them instead of lying in bed and feeling shitty about myself until I recovered. Now I still fluctuate, but I can control my mood and stay in the stable zone most of the time.",

The best advice I can give you OP, or anyone reading this, is as such:\nYou have to get to a point where you mentally love yourself, for all of your victories and all of your failures, and when you do fail, it's ok, and you have to remind yourself that it's OK to fail, as long as you learn and adapt. Keeping an open mind and an open heart. \n\nI also tried LSD, and as scary as it sounds, my experience with it was as if I had gone through decades of therapy in a single afternoon. I don't condone the abuse of drugs, but for some purposes they can be useful (LSD is also one of the least harmful ones). \n\nIts not perfect, and there are some bad days,  but I feel a little bit better. \n\nI hope this helps.",

Before the end of day, that WILL be cleaned up. \n\n2. Getting up early. \nThe last few weeks have made us work from home with a toddler. Being a software engineer, I need uninterrupted time, and so I had to wake up early to work from 4am-8am to have a more relaxed day where I can spend time with the kid. I realized that immediately making my bed when I wake up and making a nice coffee helped immensely in getting started. \n\n3. Writing documentation\nMy weak point. You cannot get me to document stuff. Writing just doesn\u2019t come naturally to me. My solution is to get started. Simply the most difficult part for me. Just get started and write for at least 5 minutes. After that if I don\u2019t feel like it, it\u2019s fair game. \n\n4. Happiness \nHaving a clean kitchen, a mowed lawn, laundry done just makes me happy. I realize that my mood is highly dependent on how clean my surroundings are, and so I put in that extra effort. \n\n5. Leaving things to the last minute \nBeing a software engineer, I wouldn\u2019t work on things till the last minute. That changed when I messed up a simple set of tasks due to procrastination and lost a LOT of credibility in front of team members I respected.  I am better at managing my time and work now and strive to not leave it till the end (for most parts at least. Can\u2019t shrug this habit off). \n\n6. Being unproductive is ok, being lazy is not. \nI had a couple of really unproductive past two days (less than 30 mins of work done). I watched movies, read quite a bit, didnt mow the lawn, didn\u2019t step out for a walk, but that\u2019s ok, I didn\u2019t feel lazy. I was clean, the kitchen is clean etc. so I let myself take it easy as far as hygiene was taken care of. \n\nJust my $0.02.",
            "I never reach full slob, but I do wax and wane in my efforts to be more productive.  I think it's somewhat due to mental fatigue; it's tiring in many ways to keep on top of a lot of things, and sometimes I need a mental break from it, so I just become more passive during that time.",

People have different natural ways of being productive and as such need to find different ways to be disciplined.  Some people cant abide by a routine all that much, it makes them miserable, and no amount of discipline will fix that.  To stay productive, I have to radically alter my environment.  I keep my room organized by deciding once a month on a system where I can keep it clean with hardly any effort.  This includes putting items in storage when I dont use them on a monthly basis so they dont clutter.  I keep a solid flossing routine by having floss sticks in the bedroom and living room so I feel less lazy about starting my night routine.  I experimented with laundry folding techniques until I found one I can do on the couch while watching tv.  I find I can keep a solid routine with minimal effort, and use my more motivated days on problems that go beyond the day to day chores.

I haven't found any way to win the war but I've got a couple battles under my belt so here's what has helped me break free in the past:\n\n1. 5 minute rule. Have something to do? Do it for 5 mins. This usually helps get the ball rolling for me and I can finish the task. Even if I dont finish it I've done at least 5 mins of work on it so it's better than it was. \n\n2. Bargaining with myself. Once the entire house has gone to shit it can be daunting to get it all cleaned up again so I'll often cut deals with myself. For example: I cant bring myself to even look at the dishes today so I'll do laundry and clean up the livingroom instead. Dishes tomorrow. This provides a kind of relief since now you dont have to do everything at once.\n\n3. Clean your room (or your main hangout area). Having a tidy personal space helps me feel calmer and the idea of cleaning the rest of the house is less anxiety inducing. It also provides a sense of accomplishment that (hopefully) will inspire me to complete more tasks. \n\nThis is just what has helped me but if they help somebody else too then my job here is done!

            "Yes, absolutely yes, you aren't alone.\n\nIn my case, I have a really, really bad memory. Never gone to the effort to get diagnosed with any actual issues, but it's clear from the feedback I receive from close friends that I've got some kind of Problem. It leads directly to me not being able to easily recall any good/productive things I've done in the past, which causes me to lose perspective and think that I'm a do-nothing slob all of the time, when really I'm probably a do-nothing slob only about a third of the time--and even that is probably being too hard on myself, since we all need some downtime.\n\nWhat I've started doing this year that's helped is keeping track of accomplishments, even small ones. Every day I list the stuff I did that day, anything from laundry to gardening to house maintenance to reading a book. Nothing fancy, just a little bulleted list. What I've found is that I have a *lot* fewer \"zero\" days than I thought I did. Having proof of this makes me feel like a better person who can get more stuff done, kind of a small virtuous cycle.\n\nKinda weird, but maybe this will help someone else.",

One of the reasons is because unethical family members may advocate for putting grandma/grandpa etc out of their misery to hasten getting their part of the inheritance.  Since putting animals out of their misery doesn't carry this benefit, this ethical dilemma isn't there.

Animals dont value living in pain for the sake of continued living. They just suffer and suffer and are miserable until they die. So once your animal is only suffering, you can put them to sleep and they dont wake up, but those final moments shouldnt be scary for the animal.

            "My mother died last year from liver failure.  It is an awful death -- you basically drown in your own lungs.  I had considered the same question you posted for years, but when it happens to someone in your family, the roadblocks become more obvious.  We did not know how long she would live. Her decline was gradual, until it wasn't. There is a component of liver failure where the toxins your liver fails to absorb end up in your brain, and it can change your personality, inhibit your mental ability, and come and go at seemingly random times.  There was no way she could have made this decision for herself.  I can't even pick the time frame in the 18 months before her death that this cognitive decline started.  \n\nI fully support people being able to pick the time of their death, and have a painless-as-possible one, if they have the mental capacity to do so, and some level of terminal/chronic diagnosis.

            "u/TheJeff is the closest on this one. It's deeply tied to history and belief systems. Greeks and Romans practiced euthanasia. It was debated by Christian theologians during the Middle Ages and by the Enlightenment philosophers we still look to today.\n\nFor this discussion, I assume, OP, you're willing to take animal euthanasia as a given, that you wouldn't advocate for its abolition. I think it's not helpful to compare animal euthanasia to human, as there's no significant historical debate over whether the former is ethical.\n\nThe debate around human euthanasia (and suicide) is interesting in that it shows what a given culture takes for granted as its key value. In Japanese history for instance there was a certain comfort with people committing suicide after \"dishonoring\" themselves, whether in battle or in finance. In Christian cultures, there's a pretty strong correlation between belief that God is \"in control\" and lack of tolerance for euthanasia. And in western medical culture, death is an enemy to be vanquished and virtually no part of a doctor's training is how to approach death in any other way, to the point that many doctors are never even taught how to discuss death with a dying patient's family.\n\nSo, OP, as you think about this, I would suggest you rephrase the question as less argumentative (your question implies you've already formed a firm opinion) and more as \"How did it come to be that people believe it is preferable keep a suffering person alive, even against their express wish to die?\"",

            "Medical professionals help people die all the time. When someone is in hospice, hospice staff will make a patient as comfortable as possible for as long as possible.

Fun fact:  when the organs shut down, you can smell a sweetness on the persons breath. I\u2019m not a medical professional by any means but I worked at an assisted living and saw it all the time.

            "If you were looking for the answer for why this paradox exists when a human is suffering so much that he or she *wants* to die, then I think the answers that have already been given are sufficient. But I think your question might have been something else, or at least there's an equally good question to ask: Why do we *generally* consider it \"merciful\" to euthanize an animal in pain while we *generally* try to keep people alive despite the pain. Think about it not in terms of crippling end-of-life pain but, say, a broken femur that's never going to work right again, or a cancer that's in its early stages. A lot of animals would be put down in those situations, but no one would think about euthanizing a person with those symptoms just yet.\n\nI think the answer there is that humans, because of their developed brains, can have meaningful lives despite disability and pain. We don't have to walk to have friendships. We can enjoy novels, and films, and games even when we hurt and cannot move. We can create and interact and sometimes enjoy life despite pain.\n\nAnimals are much more physically-oriented. When they're in pain or disabled (to a degree) it overwhelms their existence and they don't have the intellect to find escape in other things.\n\nStill, one of the tragedies of being a pet owner is that you're never really 100% sure whether the animal has reached that point; whether the cat would rather power through the next three months just to have some more time with you on the couch, or whether she's ready to go.",

            "If you are suffering and have the mental presence to make that decision you should be allowed to.  However, there is a bit of a line to be aware of here.

            "Nurse here, the greatest impediment to allowing people to die with comfort, dignity in peace in their own homes surrounded by their loved ones is that we fail to ask people what they want, we fail to keep open and honest communication and we never consider the pain and suffering we are forcing our loved ones to endure because we refuse to allow a natural death.

            "A lot of people are missing the subtext of the question, \"Why is it considered unethical despite there being similarities with the treatment of animals\", and the answer to that is because of the widely broadcast and politicized case of [Terri Schiavo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terri_Schiavo_case) in the United States in the early 90s. \n\nTerry Schiavo suffered irreversible brain damage, and fell into a vegetative state. There was a nation-spanning debate between her husband and her family, who disagreed over her continued sustenance on moral and religious grounds. Her case was extremely publicized and was hotly debated at the time, at one point requiring the US President at the time, George Bush Senior, to intervene to prevent the removal of the feeding tube.\n\nBasically, a single persons right to die became a national sensation and a partisan position.\n\nThis is my own editorialization, but I don't believe any doctor wants a protracted, expensive, and highly publicized legal battle over the right-to-die issue. I think, while they recognize the morality, would also have to recognize the legal and personal liability of taking a human life intentionally.\n\nAlso, no politician's voting bloc includes significant enough amounts of people who strongly favor pro-euthanasia legislature to make it worth integrating into their platform (and can you imagine the attack ads if they did). It's very easily a wedge issue in the making.\n\nIs it moral? Probably, humans should have a right to bodily autonomy. \n\nIs it going to be legal or legitimized in law? Probably not soon, when considering the context of professional, political, and popular animosity.\n\nEdit: There was a South Park about this very subject as well - and though I don't generally agree with south park's politics, it's message was insightful: that the goal of the right-do-die was quiet privacy and dignity in death, but the fight for that right entails the exact opposite.",

A person can, though, via a living will and just saying something. \n\nI\u2019m staunchly against euthanasia, but only because I\u2019ve seen up close how great a job we can do to make someone\u2019s final weeks and months as comfortable and pain free as possible.\n\nMy own father reached a point where he had stage four pancreatic cancer, and he knew he would only have a short time with us. So he chose to enter into Hosparus and palliative care. We gradually increased his paid meds over the final days as needed, until he passed quietly with us by his side.\n\nIt was a very peaceful end to his story, and one we were able process much better than if he had taken his own life or had someone to it for him.",

            "Who benefits financially from how the system is now?  From letting older and terminally ill people live for months and longer when they are suffering? So much money spent on people over 75 years old. If it's for quality of life it's one thing but if it's just to keep you alive and in pain or not really living  for weeks or months, that's insane.",

            "There was a guy in my middle and high school classes who had a few mental/ physical problems, like autism, Down\u2019s syndrome, and I believe two different types of cancer. Not to mention the heart problems due to his heart replacement he had to have as a child because of his Down\u2019s syndrome. There was a period of time where he had to fly from where we attend school (central Florida) all the way up to the Ronald McDonald House in NYC, once a week for the whole semester, to receive chemotherapy for the cancer that had returned for the third time. His mother spending countless amounts of money on her son who, regardless of their efforts, would most likely die before she does. Hell, she\u2019s the one who did all of his schoolwork and projects for him, because otherwise he\u2019d fail out of school. Granted, he was a very kind kid and I wish he didn\u2019t have to go through this but some people just naturally don\u2019t have a shot at life. Modern medicine is a great tool, but sometimes it\u2019s used just to prolong a life that has no purpose but to suffer.",
            "I always thought Hospice is similar. For my dad they told me for his end of life they just give him morphine so he won't feel pain till his day comes. Also there is a mental block I guess for family members to make that decision vs a pet.",

            "In my country (the Netherlands), euthanasia is legal. However, it\u2019s a incredibly difficult process most of the time, since no mistakes can be made. The person had to confirm they want to die with a lot of paperwork. And this is a problem with people with alzheimer. Imagine thinking \u201cI do not want to live when I get alzheimers\u201d. Perfectly reasonable. But when you are so far gone when you DO get alzheimers, you are legally not in a position to make that choice, since you\u2019re mentally unstable. So most of the time it is a legal issue here.",
            "Not really sure where you live. But we have the right to refuse treatment. My wife's grandmother passed away about a month ago. She went to the ER they told her what was up and said she didn't want to be admitted and that she was old and ok with dying. \n\nThey prescribed her meds to help her breathe, pain meds, her cancer treatment pills, and hospice services.

Hous daughters both in their 70s were like \"we want you to do everything you can to keep him alive.\" \n\nLike had you ladies not considered once he was in his 70s that death was always on the plate? You're both old enough to just die too? Have you never gone \"my dad is 90 something years old his body literally won't keep going for years and years more statistically.\"\n\nDying is part if life and too many people, particularly Americans I believe (am American myself), don't think these hard thoughts and force their dying family member to suffer as a result. \n\nAlso, Giving CPR to a 90 something year old you know was just dying as a natural part of life sucks. Like yeah they may come back but they'll probably die in ICU on a ventilator when they code again in a few minutes or hours typically.",

I'm not trying to say anyone is being lazy or doesn't care about their dog, just that the sacrifices necessary to really take care of a very old anything are the real reason. The humane bit is just the excuse that makes it easier to swallow. There's a reason aging parents end up in homes, it's literally a very demanding, full time endeavor to care for the very old.",

Because we have this technology, we want to keep our loved ones alive for as long as possible even if there's only a fraction of a percentage of them surviving because the fear of having them gone forever. It's almost selfish because people don't want to feel the pain of losing a loved one and (even without really considering it) the loved one is the one that endures the most suffering. Which is why making healthcare a profitable business in the US is disgusting because your loved ones is the one thing almost everyone is willing to bankrupt themselves for but that's a discussion for another time ;) \n\nMade an account just to comment because I always think about things like this, this damn site has taken up way too much of my time throughout this quarantine.

However, to actually answer the question.\n\nA human life is seen as dramatically more valuable than a dogs life. We are quicker to put a dog to sleep, because while it is heartbreaking for the owner, society doesnt see anything of great value being lost. When a human dies society sees it as something of great value lost, so we arent quick to bring about such a loss. \n\nI mean, just the fact dogs have owners and humans dont should give a hint at why it'a more acceptable to put down a dog.",

They deserve every minute we can give them.  Unless they're a super a-hole I guess.\n\nBut if a hospital is trying to keep someone alive against their will, it's simple.

Much like abortion, I think when it comes to someone\u2019s health and life changing choices, it should be up to the person who will have to deal with the biggest consequences. So if someone is suffering because of ailing health, he or she has to deal with the consequence of death at some point, and if they don\u2019t want to keep suffering it\u2019s OK imo to let them deal with whatever they want.",

I wound up working several jobs over many years where I started by like 5 AM, so I had to either adjust or fall asleep driving to work (don't ever do that).

            "Yes I used to do constantly as a teenager and my very early young adult years (18-23-ish). Probably one of the biggest mistakes of my life as it has absolutely affected my health, my schooling and even work.\n\nI'd still like to stay awake longer now, I don't really care for sleep, if I could take a pill and skip it or only sleep an hour or whatever I'd do it in an instant, but having a relatively physical 7-3 job means that when 9pm rolls around I'm tired enough that I couldn't stay up longer than an hour even if I wanted. Last night I went to bed just a bit after 10pm and just now woke up 2 hours ago at 8am. It's significantly healthier even though I'd prefer more waking hours that's just not how it works.\n\nAnother secret to this is to use your free time more efficiently. As a gamer one big thing I did was to cut out almost all multiplayer games out because they never end, there's always another match, more progression, whatever and before you know it 4 hours have passed and sure you had fun but nothing changed. Much rather stick with a solid single player game and progress through that.\n\nI also barely watch Twitch streams anymore, those are a luxury for people with a lot of time, also the ones I want to watch most are on such a different time zone than me they don't start streaming until I've already been in bed for a couple of hours or a couple of hours before I gotta get up for work anyway.\n\nSimilarly YouTube, see a video in your feed you wanna watch, hover over it and click the clock icon to put it in your Watch Later playlist, then when you're in the mood to watch videos you can go through your list and watch what you want or remove those you aren't interested in anymore without missing out on the option or having to scroll way down to find them again.",

            "No, because if I need to be sleeping, then it's not really free time, is it? At least that's how I view it. Sleep is a bodily need, it's something that absolutely has to be done, so I don't really consider it free time.",
            "Yes",
            "Shit, I\u2019m still awake from last night. \n\nFuck you Time! You\u2019ll never win.",
            "I will stay awake sometimes worrying if I fall asleep I won\u2019t wake up\u2026",
            "Yes, thats because we work 8h, commute 2h, buy groceries 1h, keep the house clean for 1h, cook for 2h, cry in the shower for 1h, sit on the toilet for 1h a day. \n\nThat leaves us with 0h of free time a day and depressions for the rest of our life\n\nr/antiwork fuck this life",
            "No, I sleep when I have free time because I feel like Im missing free sleep",
            "Biological necessity aside, sleeping is a dramatic waste of time. I get 24 hours to a day. 14 of it is preparing for, traveling, and actually being at work. 10 hours left to my day. I eat dinner and then take the dogs out for a walk. Another 1-1.5 hours gone after cleanup. 8.5 hours left. Spend some quality time with my children and wife another 1.5-2 hours. ~6.5 hours left. Hit the gym and shower, brush my teeth, etc.. is another 1.5 hours. 5 hours left in a 24 hour day and I have yet to do ANYTHING for just myself to relax or did anything to clean the house besides the dishes. I haven't even factored in feeding the infant or having a puppy to walk every hour on the hour. So let's round it down to 4 hours left in a 24 hour day. I intend to spend at least 0.5-1 hour to myself playing a game, reading, or watching a show. No time expressly to myself, FOR myself, makes me a very angry and depressed person, so it isn't really optional. That leaves 3 hours of potential sleep a night, assuming I fall asleep immediately and my infant sleeps through that entire stretch of time, a cat doesn't sit on my face or springboard off my chest, my 3 year old doesn't crawl into bed cause they woke up, and I don't need to manage a puppy cause they woke up.\n\nI'm not trying to get revenge on sleep. I'm trying to perform the absolute bare minimum requirements of home life so I can both be a father and husband while having to work while doing my best to keep my physical and mental health... Hardly acceptable.",
            "Every parent I've spoken to about this.",
            "I mean I want to...\n\nBut tomorrow me world have a shit time being groggy and mean\n\nAlso I don't want to make mistakes driving, at work, or to ppl cuz I'm tired\n\nUnfortunately part of growing up is realizing that there's a bigger picture\n\nRather then the mini Revolt I want to do because by the time I get home I have. Only 3-3.5 hours to do all my nessisary things and fun things before sleeping\n\nTldr: responsibilities suck, but it's the price you pay to have adult freedom",
            "Almost everyone does.",
            "I used to feel this. Now I\u2019ve come to the not-as-sad-as-it-sounds conclusion that our time is limited, that I\u2019m not supposed to have unlimited free time, and that it\u2019s okay to miss out on things.",
            "Sleep is my free time... Is there any activity more engaging, more satisfying, more relaxing than unconsciousness? It's like a little taste of sweet sweet death!",
            "I used to refuse to go to bed as I dreaded whatever the next work day would bring. \n\nI did like my job, but I was very overloaded and very stressed. Most likely so stressed that when I look back I might have been depressed. \n\nI also dreaded going to bed as my brain would not shut off. It would not go quiet. It was the opposite and it would get soooo loud in my mind. It felt like a carnival in there. One that everyone else got to enjoy while I was just an onlooker that felt worse about it. \n\nIt was a coping mechanism that in the end just made me feel even worse. \n\nSo no. You\u2019re far from alone. But for your longevities sake, find out what you can do during the day/evening that makes you feel that you have free time you enjoy. That still enables you to go to bed and have a decent day after (and yet another, and another and another! \u2764\ufe0f)",
            "Yes!! Yes and yes!!",
            "Every. Damn. Night. I'm constantly exhausted, and am never 100%. But to go to sleep feels like giving up on what little, precious time for myself I have. I'd rather be tired.",
            "My work days last roughly 10-12 hours, nit including the time to get ready and leave which adds another 2-3 hours onto the day. Thats a 13-15 hour day and I'm fucking exhausted afterwards. But I'm gonna force myself to stay up longer if I have to because working all day, sleeping immediately, and then repeating the cycle isn't a life worth living",
            "Welcome to being a parent hahaha",
            "Mothers.  Mothers do this.  They debate every night between going to bed because they are exhausted or staying up for that one hour of alone time.",
            "Yes. I feel like I\u2019m wasting my life if I sleep for half of it",
            "People do this? I try to sleep as much as I can because the agony of waking life is too much to bear sometimes.",
            "Daily struggle. \n\nI work from 7am till 730pm and after a shower I have a measly 2 hours to myself but around 10pm, all I want to do is stay awake because the second I go to bed it\u2019s all over and I have to work all day again \ud83d\ude2d",
            "I find myself staying up late asf sometimes because it feels like the only time I can do or watch what I actually want. \n\nBetween my SO being kind of controlling about it or just being busy with my son it often feels like I\u2019m just doing or watching what they want all the time and have to wait until they\u2019re asleep to watch what I want. \n\nLike damn, can\u2019t I watch the Last Kingdom before 1 am ever \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\udc80",
            "Yes and you have yo go to work sooner, because sleep passes by so quickly.",
            "Absolutely. I work 7pm to 730 am. I'll get off work to start my weekend Friday morning and will stay up till my body just gives out. I get probably no more than 10hours of sleep across fri-sun, because I don't wanna waste time sleeping. Be careful with that though. Can't sleep more than 2 hours strait now and depression will set in eventually.",

            "Never realized this is exactly what I\u2019ve always done. I am definitely getting more time out of the day with my midnight bike rides. I do it cause I really like being on the roads when no one else is. Go to sleep about 4-5 and up around 10 always works for me.",
            "YUP \u2026.but then I end up tired and more depressed because I stay awake doomscrolling and feeling hopeless and helpless about the world.",
            "When I was young I always tried to get as much out of a day as possible.\n\nWe were right, because once you get old it isnt nearly as easy to be up past midnight and when you do, you pay for it the next day.",
            "I stay awake late because I babysit everyday even when my sister is home. So when the kids are asleep thats the only time I have for myself. Can't even go out for a smoke break without my name being yelled by my sister or her kids.",
            "Absolutely. Having a 3 year old and working all day, you don\u2019t get much free time. I normally just sit on my porch for hours doing absolutely nothing. All I need is quiet.",
            "I tend to not go back to sleep if I wake up extra early.",
            "Yeah! Think it\u2019s called revenge sleep procrastination, when your tired and should sleep but you stay awake to try to reaffirm some sense of control in your life. Love it. :D",
            "I suffered from insomnia because I felt trapped in a job that I hated and the idea of falling asleep, waking up and having to go to the office the next day was absolutely dreadful to me. \nAt some point I couldn\u2019t take it anymore, told everyone that I wasn\u2019t feeling well, walked out of the office and went to see a doctor. \n\nHe listens to me and told me that I had a bad case of burn out due to bullying and that was that. \nThankfully I live in Europe so I basically stayed home for nine months, got therapy and started looking for a new job.",

            "Hell no, I go home at night, every night, because I have a fear of missing out on sleep.",

            "I don\u2019t remember the time era of when this changed to our modern ways of sleep- but I remember reading that people used to not just have \u201cone sleep \u201c of many hours. \nPeople used to either have \u201ctwo sleeps\u201d or \u201cthree sleeps\u201d, many times depending on their livelihood or jobs. \n\n\nFor example, farmers may wake at 5 in the morning to tend to their animals and crops. Supper at 4 then sleep from 5pm-8pm. Wake at 8pm to tend to animals again and have their down time. Sleep again from midnight until 5am. \n\n\nOr the ones i most connected with were people considered the \u201ccreatives\u201d. People who were creative and an artist of various kinds. Poets, musicians, dancers, theatre playwrites, painters, et cetera. They found that their best ideas tend to come in the middle of the night. Either waking from a vivid dream providing their inspiration, or waking to feel the most invigorated and full of ideas and creativity between 3:00 to 5:00 in the morning. I have frequently found myself at these same times waking with ideas I just had to write down too. \n\nAnd this made me wonder, why things changed. We tend to want to pack in SO MUCH during the daytime and are so drained when we wake up. But I know so many people who just aren\u2019t built to fit the \u201c9am-5pm\u201d work model and  8hours of sleep at night model that we are forced to live by, anything else is frowned upon as not \u201cproductive\u201d.",
