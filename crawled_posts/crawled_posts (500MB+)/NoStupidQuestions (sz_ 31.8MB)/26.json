            "I saw this comment a while back somewhere on Reddit, and I look at it every now and again when I feel myself slipping into depressive tendencies or living on autopilot:\n\n\"I spent the first half of my adult life living on fast forward. I worked hard to get through college with almost no student debt. I worked 60+ hours when off from school and full time with a full time schedule. I grew up a have-not with uneducated parents and a single mom that broke her back so I could have opportunity. I put that on my shoulders and powered through. I studied business and finance, and now I own a business.\nThe thing is, despite being proud of that time, I can hardly remember feeling happy. I can remember laughing with friends from college I swore at the time were my brothers, or being in the trance-like state of being young and in love, but not just genuinely feeling happy. I know I was at times, but I can\u2019t recall clearly because of all the work and travel and thrill-chasing.\nWhen I was 24 my mom, who was the monolith of everything good about my identity, got small cell lung cancer and died within the year. You want to talk about a blur. I cared for her as she did hospice in our home and I can remember the wild ride of trying to do everything I could to make her smile, then everything I could to make her comfortable, then everything I could to squeeze a life\u2019s worth of life lessons into a week, to finally hoping with all my heart that she wasn\u2019t in pain as she laid there unable to respond to anything. If you want to talk about a hard stop to a break-neck life, then losing your beacon in the storm is it.\nAt the end, I remember telling her I\u2019d make her proud. That I\u2019d do something with my education and make a name for myself. She said \u201cI\u2019ll be proud of you either way\u201d. God, just typing that wrenches my gut now a decade later. One day I was pushing her on a wheelchair to this ice cream shop we had been to countless times in my childhood. It was less than a block away. She had me stop. I was confused. She told me she just wanted to close her eyes and feel the sun and listen to the robins. She told me that whenever the sunshine warmed my face that she\u2019d be holding my face in her hands.\nWhen she finally let go, her funeral was the real shock to the system. Not because she was actually gone, but because of the sheer number of souls at the funeral that I had never met. My mom and dad adopted me in their thirties. I met countless people from before that time that my mom had touched. She helped so many people get through school, leave abusive partners, kick drug habits, raise\u00a0their\u00a0kids, and the list goes on. It was a real eye-opener. She never had much money in her whole life. She had a long career in medical billing at the end. She didn\u2019t win the rat race per se, but she resonated so beautifully with so many people.\nThat\u2019s what being alive is fucking about my friends. Being present for yourself, and for others and resonating beyond today in ways that are important. I think about all of the mistakes I made as a young adult. Being brash and insensitive, being naive and loud with my opinions, crossing the line of consent and autonomy in many ways with a lot of people, saying I didn\u2019t have time for the people I could see were struggling, taking advantage of people and angling all the time to get ahead (which growing up in poverty is sort of a byproduct of survival and hard to shake), and also just NOT BEING THERE. I mean like auto-pilot life despite all of the rich things in life around me.\nIf you read this far just know this. I get up every morning and close my eyes and just listen. I take a minute and think about what a privilege it is to be able to take in even the mostly silent stimuli of an empty room. If my cat decides to sleep at my feet I listen for her little kitty breath or watch her lungs fill up and rise and fall and think about whether she knows how much I love her. I have a cup of coffee and I really taste it. I think about the crazy process it goes through to even be a bean much less be in a cup warming my soul and opening my eyes. I have a busy schedule no doubt, and I have a flood of stimuli barrages every day, but I spend so much time \u201clistening to the robins\u201d. I people watch like crazy, I take the time to match smiles sent my way, I don\u2019t let someone I think is in pain pass by unnoticed, and I try to get know people\u2019s paths that lead to who they are now when they wrong me because understanding that much about someone gives you peace even if it doesn\u2019t excuse what they do. I have a rule of taking 10. Take ten seconds to calm down, take in, consider, feel, etc. Ten seconds to ask a question. Ten seconds to google something you\u2019re curious about. Ten seconds to see just how rich everything is in this crazy beautiful existence. I can\u2019t stress enough how much better I feel everyday, and I close my eyes in the sunshine for mom every chance I get.\"",

I can see the world, but I can't interact with it, not *really*.\n\nWhat helps me during those dissociative episodes is to go for a walk, at first it seems to get worse and I just get in my head more, but after 10-15 minutes it starts making me feel more grounded and connected to the world.

            "Hi OP, I hope you see my advice.\n\nI recently had a few revelations about life. Have you ever thought about the impact you have on everyone\u2019s lives? Have you ever thought about how you, as the master of your life, have controls over so many things?\n\nThese things are diet, habits, who you are friends with, what makes you happy, ...\n\nSo that\u2019s how you have control over your life, make it what you like!",
            "External locus of control",
            "Hi, first off I want you to know that this is definitely a widespread condition, and that most people have acknowledged this as being their condition at least once in their life. To answer your question, yeah I've felt like that a lot.\n\nIn fact, I'd like to share with what I've gathered from my own experience with this, take it or leave it :)\n\nAs someone else has already suggested here, being an observer is actually in itself something you do, that you've been doing, and there is no actual gap between the \"observer-mode\" and the \"active-participant-mode\".\n\n\nYou are already disposed to be both. \n\n \nIf you want to really shake yourself out of the \"observer-mode\", my very counter-intuitive suggestion would be to think of your limited time on earth. If you consider that, anytime now, everything and anything will become impossible for you (which is true), and seriously consider it, what comes to mind as what you want to do before that happens ?\n\nWhatever it is, I'm sure it's worth acting upon. And I'm also sure that if you do act upon it, you'll suddenly realise the observing part of you has been learning how to help you all along. It has in unsuspected ways. Odds are that you have a subtle way with things, because, as an observer, you tend to respect beings. If you want to also be an active participant, learn to also respect the possibilities that are only your own. Acting, in a sense, is just observing what only you can do in the world, before there's no more time left for you to do them, and they disappear with you.\n\n\nThat being said, it's okay to not always be the active participant in life. It's okay, and it's a valuable trait to be aware of where you are, what's going on, and how you feel about it.\n\n\nOh, and you're allowed to acknowledge how the historical and socioeconomic conditions in which you are affect you, no matter what they say ;)",

            "Like an NPC",
            "Try to take control and part of you simply refuses, like something subconscious just won\u2019t allow you to act? Like... maybe you could just do something for the sake of proving you can, but part of you is making you feel terrible for even thinking of doing what you consciously want to do and it convinces you that it isn\u2019t worth it, against all reasoning, you can\u2019t fight it.\n\nYeah, I\u2019m there all the time. It didn\u2019t help when I became a very deterministic nihilist, that said I don\u2019t go back because I can\u2019t rationalize anything else without evidence. Eventually I learned that the best you can do is get help. If you can\u2019t bring yourself to buy into some motivational speech or other placebo, you need to figure out some way to convince that subconscious part of you that change and being proactive are worth it. \n\nJust don\u2019t forget that something doesn\u2019t lose value because it is subjective. I started to feel like my feelings didn\u2019t matter for that reason. But nothing matters without subjectivity, prioritizing objectivity over subjectivity is, in itself, subjective. If you\u2019re stuck, and you want something, it\u2019s okay to want it and there\u2019s nothing wrong with asking for help to get there if you are having trouble now. You just need to condition yourself to start. Take baby steps and do a little more each time until your mind warms up to it. It gets easier, and there is something to look forward to once you get there, you\u2019ll feel it. It feels different, and you\u2019ll feel different, not just subconsciously. You won\u2019t beat yourself up over it so bad anymore.",

Within the past 2-3 years, he worked about 2-3 jobs, all of which he wasn't able to keep for more than a year and spent all his money on expensive computer parts and games. Each time we asked why he quit, he said he didn't like the job. I spoke to him multiple times, but one time he opened up a bit and said he finds life to be depressing. He finds the cycle of waking up, going to work, go home, sleep, and repeat depressing and doesn't want to do that for the rest of his life. He said he wanted to have a passion in something, but he can't find what he likes. He barely exit his room. Only to shower, restroom, and food. Otherwise, he stays in his room.\n\nAt this point, me and my wife wants to help him. But we don't know what to do. We've thinking of kicking him out, but I'm not sure I want to do that.\n\nSo I want to try and ask online for some opinions of other parents who are potentially in similar situations. How can we help our son?\n\nUpdate - So after reading some of the posts here (sorry, I haven't replied. I didn't think it would explode like this), I decided to go give him the talk again. Asked him things like if he was willing to try therapy. He said he is willing to try anything. We chatted for a few hours, and he opened up a lot more. He told me he feels stuck, like his life is now at a stagnant and only resort to working 9-5 jobs. He also confessed that he felt guilty living like this under us and does want to change, just doesn't know where to begin since there is so many resources and he feels very lost. I asked him if his mom and I were to die today, what would he do? He said he'd be very screwed since he doesn't know anything. He also said he's already been applying for jobs here and there but no one would respond. I showed him Indeed and asked him to apply there. He said it's just a bunch of outdated or fake listing and he doesn't trust it. In the end, we decided to end the conversation with an agreement that he will go to therapy, and he has 4 months to get a job. Then I will charge him rent money. He agreed to that idea.  \n\nThat is one step towards the right direction. I really pray that we can help him. All we wanted was to raise and see our son grow up and be independent. I see that perhaps we were too lenient towards him. But nonetheless, we will do whatever we can to help him. \n\nThanks for the support reddit. \n\n&#x200B;",

            "This subject is very close to my heart. My daughter took 7 years post-high school to find her niche and get employed full time. She tried 1 year of college and when that didn't work out, she moved home and didn't leave. She helped around the house and what-not, but wasn't bringing in any money. She is on the autism spectrum, and was diagnosed with depression in her senior year of high school, so that did contribute to the slowness in getting her to launch.\n\nI can't tell you how many times my mother INSISTED that I needed to throw her out! Just like that - toss her to the curb. WTF. I gave birth to this child. It is my responsibility to guide her through life. I also promised myself that my daughter wouldn't have the sort of upbringing that I did. I was forced to start working at 13 years old, and I hated it, hated my mother, hated my life. I see no reason children (under the age of 18) should be forced to work. Rant over.\n\nWhat really helped my daughter was working for a temp agency. She worked different types of jobs - some for a few days or maybe even a couple of weeks. But, it meant getting up in the morning, driving to the temp agency office and waiting for work. At first she was pretty against it, but guess what - she found her place in society by trying a variety of work for daily pay. Getting paid daily can be a great incentive for some folks.\n\nAnd playing video games has actually really helped with her socializing because she plays co-op games with the same group of people all the time. She has met people IRL that she first met online and formed great friendships.\n\nI think the biggest final push that got her to start a \"normal\" full-time M-F job was wanting better computer equipment and tattoos - 2 things I refused to pay for once she turned 20 or so. We bought her a nice laptop for college, but that didn't last forever, and she wanted something more equipped for gaming. So, a job was her only way to go.\n\nHer and I still live together. My S.O. passed away some time ago, and there wasn't any reason for her to move out. So, we found this cute twin home to rent, and we split everything 50/50 and it has been terrific.\n\nTL:DR: My daughter didn't get a full-time job until she was in her late twenties. Before that she worked temp work on and off for about 2 years - more off than on. But cleaning toilets at the local fairgrounds in the summer, and making beds at hotels for days convinced her to find something she liked and could do 8 hours a day - 5 days a week.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the award! So glad that so many people related to my situation. Also, my daughter now works in a pasta plant, and we have free pasta for life!",
            "Has he talked to a psychologist? If not, that's probably be the most important thing right now.",
            "Going through something similar, mine has a few chronic issues that are a barrier to finding and keeping work though. Plus he finished school right at the start of the pandemic and lockdowns around here, severely impacting on his ability to even look for work for the first two years out of school.\nHe'll just hang around stinking up his room chatting and playing games with his online mates. We tried therapy, \"doesn't work\" and now I'm pushing him to try meds. \n\nThe depression is very real, experiencing it myself for 20+ years, but you've got to push *yourself* somehow to survive around its impact. I don't know how to make it happen, people preach tough love when they won't be living with the consequences. I don't even know how I got myself to get help, it just clicked one day that I should. \n\nI'm sorry, it's hard.",
            "I was in the same shoes at his age. I'm now 26. What helped me was years of therapy and finding medication for my anxiety and depression. It was hard work, but it was the only way out of that mentality. Make him go. You can't make him take it seriously. That's up to him. But you can make him go. Having a professional to talk to that isn't his parents might make a big difference. It did for me. My parents love me and support me through everything, but I couldn't talk to them. I could talk to my therapist, though. He had heard it all before. And some of the \"answers\" my parents had for me were working against me just because I didn't know better. \n\nTherapy works.",
            "I went through something similar in my early teens/adulthood- I was cripplingly depressed. Had did no motivation to do anything except, much like your son, play games. The only time I felt \"ok\" was when I was coordinating a raid or some shit. \n\nI strongly suggest getting him to see a therapist (even if you have to lowkey threaten it?)- I wish I had so maybe I would have gotten better earlier instead of struggling for so long and wasting a chunk of my life.",
            "i was in his position. i struggled for a long time. was misdiagnosed with depression and the treatments did more harm than good. then i was diagnosed with ADHD and when i found a treatment that helped I finally started becoming the person i wanted to be.\n\nnot to say that your son has ADHD, but there could be something there holding him back, mentally. be patient with him. i desperately wished i could be normal and i likely wouldn't be here today if i didn't have my parents' patience and understanding",
            "\n1. **Seek Professional Help**: Encourage your son to speak with a mental health professional. The behaviors you've described suggest that he may be dealing with depression or other mental health issues. A professional can diagnose and treat these issues, which is often the first step towards improving motivation and quality of life.\n\n2. **Set Clear Expectations**: Establish boundaries and expectations for living in your home. This could include requiring him to seek employment, contribute to household chores, or actively apply for college/financial aid.\n\nRemember, this is a complex issue and it's unlikely to be resolved overnight. Patience, understanding, and consistent support will be crucial throughout this process.",
            "Many mental illnesses have these behaviors as symptoms, and all kicking him out will do is make him homeless and hungry. And possibly turn to drugs because he doesn't have gaming. Gaming is an addiction and a crutch, an escape from reality, just like any drug dependency.\n\nKicking out your son will essentially kill him. Mental support is what he needs. Emotional support. And support is not \"Hey I can help you find a job. I can help you fill out aid applications.\"\n\nThose things are telling him he's not going to get support unless he's contributing money to the house. He obviously finds working to be either mentally stressful or overwhelming. Or maybe it goes the other way and the mind-numbing routine makes his depression worse.\n\nMany people his age are loving in similar situations with their own parents right now because the world is collapsing around them. They go to work and what they make in a whole month doesn't even cover rent for the month in most places. I was an assistant manager and worked four dollars above minimum wage and I was consistently bringing home just enough to cover our rent. Thankfully my boyfriend lives with me and has a trade job and he makes quite a bit more. \n\nBut without a second income living alone is impossible. He WILL be homeless if you kick him out, that is a certainty. Even if he HAD a job. He's rightfully depressed about that. What the hell is the point of going to a job that treats me horribly and I can't even live off of it? There isn't one. That's not sustainable. Work two jobs? Where do you find two jobs where you can work 40hrs a week? Those usually are pretty hard to find, or they're in a niche/stereotypical field that he probably wouldn't consider. \n\nMy mental health has always been bad, but working as a manager, giving my entire being to my job because I loved it so much, only to be consistently torn down and told it wasn't good enough every day for four years, my mental health was destroyed.\n\nI quit. My boyfriend has been amazing and understanding/supportive that I'm just not ready to go back to work. I've been off for a little under a year. I have a therapist. I have a psychiatrist. I have my financial advisor at my bank who loves my \"fix-it\" attitude and as soon as something goes wrong or I need help, she's been single-handedly keeping us afloat.\n\nIf you don't have a support system? Living right now just isn't fucking worth it. It isn't. Going to school may be a better option, but that is a LOT of mental stress on someone who already feels like there isn't any point to existing outside of video games.\n\nI don't know him, and he may very well be a snotty, lazy, entitled brat. But if he isn't...he's just one of the thousands of people our age that just don't understand how we're supposed to live.\n\nDid you know, it's predicted that our age group will have to save 22 years to buy their own home? And a down-payment by then will be $215,000. A DOWN-PAYMENT. Ten percent. In what world is that sustainable? We won't ever reach that. Economic doom is coming and it's only going to get worse.\n\nTell your son that you've read a few articles and changed your mind. Support him. Find YOURSELF a therapist who can give you tools to do that properly. Maybe he get into something online so he can make it part of his routine. A lot of therapist and counselors have that option available now.\n\nDon't kick him out. Please. Because there is nowhere for him to go.",
            "I have ADHD and depression and I can relate to your description of him. If you can get him proper treatment you might see a significant change, over time.",
            "Therapy, OP. I strongly recommend against listening to the tough love people on this thread. Depression is a bitch, and it's encouraging that he's being honest with you about his feelings about that. The previous generations just shoved everything down and pushed through, and that shit is why we have so many miserable, mentally ill, hateful people in our society. \n\nDepression kills. There is a suicide crisis among young men in this country. Don't take this lightly. To me it sounds like he needs love and understanding, and some enforced structure, like \"you can stay here as long as you go to therapy every week and do whatever homework the therapist gives you\", and then once he's feeling a bit better, you can add getting a job or going to school to those conditions, etc. \n\nGoing scorched earth helps no one and will only isolate him.",

            "Go to community college and figure out what he wants to do with his life? It\u2019s cheaper than actual college and will allow avenues that he hasn\u2019t thought about before. It\u2019ll get him out of the house, meet people, make connections\n\nEDIT: I apologize for using the words \u201cactual college\u201d. Im actually the only one in my family going to community college and I guess I was projecting when I wrote this. But I recommended community college because that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing at the moment and it\u2019s really been helpful. On the hand, it\u2019s nice getting some affirmation I\u2019m going to a real college.",
            "That boy has (much warranted) depression. \n\nTherapy is the correct option. But getting him to go could be an issue. \n\nSo change the atmosphere. Go camping for week. Don't spring it on him, let him know what's going to happen. Get him off the computer and out of his nest. No phones. Let him detoxify for a day or so out in the woods without a screen. Then sit and talk with him. \n\nIf he doesn't want to work, then what does he want to do? \n\nWalk him through it without judgement. \n\nAsk how you can support what he wants to do. \n\nAnd follow through. \n\nEven if you think it's stupid. \n\nBecause chances are he'll realize it's stupid too. Eventually. \n\nBe creative together. \n\nCare about helping him, and he'll care about helping you.",
            ">I showed him Indeed and asked him to apply there. He said it's just a bunch of outdated or fake listing and he doesn't trust it.\n\n\nHonestly I get him. I've found indeed to be pretty shit in my experience but I was just looking for retail work.",
            "He's not lying about the fake job ads on indeed lots of scammers looking for info. \n\nHowever he does need a job. Maybe call a few places and apply online.",
            "If navigating a financial aid application is the only thing that stands between him and college, couldn't you help him with that, or find someone who can? College might help him find a passion, or failing that, something he doesn't mind doing for a living.",
            "Here\u2019s the best piece of advice I can give you.\nDon\u2019t take advice on parenting from the internet. This place is full of dopamine fiends and shitheads. Talk to someone professionally for this and be careful.",
            "As someone who was doing the same thing to my parents a few months ago, I can try to share my experience.\nI was exactly like that, always trying to get away from reality and only doing the bare necessities to keep my body alive, but not wanting to engage with society in any way. Sit in bed all day, read, play games, watch movies, whatever.\nMy parents made me pay a small \"rent\" and would sometimes get me out of bed to eat with them, but I had enough money saved to last me a while, and I always went back to my room as soon as I could.\nI am now in another country, in a place that cares about the environment, does their utmost to make things better, where compassion is the number one rule, and where money holds (almost) no power. The work I do here, I do because I want to. Because it is something that has meaning to me, rather than to earn money. This is what changed everything.\n\nSome people can't find enough meaning in life to just get up everyday and work for so long, for money. Some people can't be satisfied with the way society works right now. These people need help. Help him find what he would like to do, explore alternative ways of living, give him a lot of space so he can truly think, and come up with an answer on his own, that will really be meaningful to him.\n\nOnce/if he ever finds something that he might want to try, you will still probably have to push him. Getting out of your comfort zone to try something like this is extremely difficult. Even though I knew about this place for a long time, it took me 6 months between the moment I decided to go, and the moment I actually went. Because my parents managed to push me, while supporting me. It must have been incredibly difficult for them, and they probably don't understand what I find so amazing about this place. But being here was a lifechanger for me, and I don't think I can go back to those days of only playing games anymore.\n\nRemember to be loving, patient and compassionate. This is someone who, even though he might be content with what he is doing right now, still needs help. I never used reddit enough to know if there was some kind of personnal messaging system. If you ever feel like talking to someone similar to him who actually made it out of there would be helpful to him, I would gladly try to speak to him.\n\nGood luck to your son, and good luck to you.",
            "If you want something specific, and if you live in the US, look into Americorps. I did the NCCC program between high school and college, and it was absolutely the best decision of my life. The NCCC program does a few different projects in a region, rather than one project all year, so it will give him a wider variety of work to dabble in, but the cutoff age is 24 or 25 so he'll want to act quickly!\n\n\nLiving on a stipend helped me to manage money responsibly. Working on a team of my peers taught me more than I could put into words here. Living and working in a different part of the country than the place I grew up also taught me so, so much.",
            "Wow, I am feeling a little bit ... grounded right now. You are describing exactly how I used to be too.   \n\n\nI won't bore you with the details of my life. I am glad to hear that you want to help him, remember that help is about what improves his life, it will be frustrating at times and you will question why you are doing it. These are the things that massively helped me.  \n\n\nGo to a doctor and psychologist. Keep going until you find one he connects with. He doesn't necessarily have to go on antidepressants but he should have the conversation. \n\nMaking plans to change my sleep schedules. It's extremely hard to do this after a long period, 15 minutes a week is how fast you can change it. \n\nCutting down or deleting social media. After a week you don't even miss it!  \n\n\nCutting down smoking/alcohol/drugs if he uses any of them.   \n\n\nGoing to the gym/exercising has helped me alot too. Even just finding something lame like a short walk once a day is enough.   \n\n\nOf course it's hard to do all of those things without some effort. Gotta be healthy before you can start, so focus on health first.   \n\n\nIt can be a long and hard journey and a tough place to get out of. Please frequently remind him that you love him and will help him achieve anything. Don't start nagging, that is counterproductive, but do encourage and help him feel like he's not a lost cause.   \n\n\nAnd also don't treat him like a child. Treat him like an adult who needs a hand, because that's exactly who he is. Don't take away the internet or be demanding or make him feel shitty. He wants to be happy to, he's jut a bit stuck at the moment!  \n\n\nBest of luck, I really it helps him find his way. Message me anytime you'd like!",
            "As someone who\u2019s been where ur kid is I can just say this,\n\nI think your son is being honest about feeling depressed. It\u2019s exhausting trying to do anything when the future of the world looks so bleak. Just do your best to support him in what he seems interested in. You say he\u2019s interested in going to college but the finance part of it is confusing and bothering him? Help him with the finance part. \n\nA lot of us do *want* to succeed but knowing that the battle is so uphill and that you\u2019ll almost never be able to escape poverty or even if you do that the world will probably end in our lifetime makes the effort seem pointless. The most you can likely do is make the effort required as minimal as possible.",
            "Get him mental help asap, don't take away the only things making him happy right now (computer, intertnet, ect) like other people are saying. That could be the only shit keeping him alive if he's really so hopeless. I'm in the same(ish) situation, and if I had my stuff taken right now, id off myself. Don't let that same thing happen to your son. Get him help before you push him",
            "Oof, this one will bring out a *lot* of fetishistically disciplinarian redditors",
            " Honestly, going back to school renewed my life and I found purpose and motivation. Motivation is key if he wants to change his path. Kicking him out of the house isn't going to motivate him. I had a friend whose parents kicked him out when i was younger, and he just went around and mooched off everyone. Had another friend who also got kicked out, started hanging out with the wrong crowd, then was murdered. Continually kick him in the pants to get out and do something whether it be school or working even part time, dont kick him out.",
            "A couple things. He might be depressed. He might be discouraged. But he needs to internalize the reality of what his future will look like if he doesn\u2019t take any steps to build it. \n\nIt sounds like he likes building his computer (based on the computer parts).. maybe he should consider looking into doing IT or something. \n\nDo you live in the US? Near a major city? Look into a program called Year Up. It\u2019s a great free program that would actually pay him to take it. Sounds too good to be true but it isn\u2019t. I know a lot of people who have done it. It\u2019s 6 months of taking a course and then a 6 month internship at a top company in whatever track/field he chooses. They have Finance, IT, Quality Assurance, Project Management etc. Most if not all people who take the program land a pretty good paying job without a degree. Seriously look into it. College is expensive and he might be able to find a passion through Year Up without paying or going to college to figure it out.\n\nOr maybe he should consider joining the military. He\u2019d be able to live on his own and possibly even work with computers, not necessarily an infantry type job where he goes to war and gets ptsd. Military offers a ton of really good benefits.\n\nAnother possibility which idk is a good idea to recommend would be if he loves just playing games maybe he could start a channel on YouTube or Twitch talking about games or streaming himself playing games. I\u2019ve heard many people can make money doing this. Enough to even live on their own sometimes. But there is a certain level of consistency and dedication involved with making that work.\n\nIdk there are a few options but none of them involve letting him just sit around doing nothing. It\u2019s one thing if he was at least working but if he\u2019s just doing nothing he\u2019s just fully taking advantage of you whether consciously or unconsciously. Maybe ask him if he really wants to just be doing absolutely nothing for the rest of his life. Try to have an adult conversation about how fast his future is going to come. If he\u2019s already 23 than boy I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t need me to tell you how fast the numbers are going to go up from here",

I've gone through what he is probably going and if you threw him out he would probably just accept it and starve to death, not much point fighting when it feels like there's no fight left in you. \n\nWe live in a depressing time where more and more young people feel like they've been let down. They're looking forward to a life of indebted servitude due to crippling student loans and not being able to afford a simple appartement after a life of work. Sure it feels like a battle that can't be won.\n\nTherapy would do him wonders as well as learning what's important and how to keep up the fight when things get bleak, but those are things you learn in time and your parents kicking you out at your worst surely won't help him feel neither loved nor supported, you know?\n\nGive him time and support, trust in him like you would trust in yourselves and for God's sake, have a little patience. He could be suffering from burnout, depression, anxiety, ADHD or worse. He might be even hiding most of his pain out of love and fear of disappointing you.

            "THIS IS NOT MEDICAL ADVICE:\n\nSpeaking from personal experience as of now and as a health professional, I was and am in the same position as your son. I have taken a year break for my Masters (from 23-->24) after working 3 years in a mix between pharmacy and retail during COVID 19 period. From my perspective he wants to achieve happiness and in his view, his only way to achieve it is through gaming. Logically, it would make sense for him to spend on something that he believe could make him happy. Deep down, he is very likely  to recognise that there is a problem and is afraid to face and break the current cycle of monotony, just to be forced into another (e.g. eat --> work --> sleep and repeat). I believe an ultimatum would be the worst approach as it could force him to leverage something as an counterargument. In the absolute worst case scenario, his life. I would try to understand his thoughts and views, make him comfortable in vocalising them, then suggesting healthcare intervention. Remember that internet opinions hold no consequences, your actions do. I sincerely hope he finds himself once again.

That might be more his speed.  Just make sure you're up front with the fact that it will NOT be all fun and games, even if playing games is what he's doing, and it WILL take time for him to get the kind of traction needed to be successful.\n\nSome exercise can help too.  Nothing too strenuous, maybe a half-hour walk every day.\n\nAnd tell him he's not the only person in the world who finds that cycle to be depressing.  For a lot of people, it is SUPER depressing, and rightly so.

            "Hi, 33F here. I am exactly like your son, but 10 years older. I will speak to my own experience here, and will not offer any direct advice. \n\nI was 18 when I went to college the first time. I dropped out after 1 month. I became very depressed - all my peers were off at college and succeeding, while still having fun and balancing living away from home. I was put on various medications and went through the rigamarole of waiting 4-6 weeks, assess how I'm feeling, change meds again and repeat. That whole process was depressing as well.\n\nMy parents did think about kicking me out as well. I dont know what I would have done if they had. I probably would have died, one way or another.\n\nI finally found a niche I was good at when I was 26. I went to school for it in a 1 year program, and worked in the industry for a year and a half before I couldnt handle it anymore. \n\nSince then, I've been diagnosed with agoraphobia with panic disorder, ADHD, and some other things, on top of existing major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. I also recognize that I am autistic, though I have not been diagnosed. I've gotten on disability income support, and I no longer feel like a financial burden on my parents.\n\nIn the last year, as my dad's health has begun to decline, he has needed assistance in household finances. I'm responsible for paying my parents' bills (through their accounts, not mine LOL). I've also learned other life skills that my dad has taken care of but can no longer do so. Things like changing the propane tank on the bbq, cleaning the pool, changing the furnace filter; little things that need to be done, but my dad can't do. As a result, I've started to feel like I matter. My presence here in this world, and in this house, matters. \n\nMy heart goes out to you, your spouse, and your son. None of this is easy for anyone to navigate. Please know that these feelings that you're feeling are completely valid. Big hug energy for you all.",

He has to start paying x amount of rent monthly. Charge him (a small amount of) rent so that he can learn responsibility. You can put that money in a high yield savings account and give it back to him when he is ready to move out. Tell him to look into courses he is interested in. Look them up in YouTube. If he is further interested in pursuing a career, he can sign up for university. He needs to learn how to survive on his own. You won\u2019t be there for him forever.",

Yes, it would help if he would try therapy and/or medication. But he can refuse to do those things as well (\"I'm too tired.\" \"I forgot.\" \"I don't like pills.\")\n\nSo I recommend giving both support AND boundaries.\n\n(1) Help him get therapy and/or medicine, *but with deadlines.* \"Make the appt by Friday or we will change the wi-fi password.\"  \n\n(2) Encourage him to get a job and move out with both support AND deadlines. \"Find a full-time job by the end of the month or we stop paying your cell phone.\"\n\n(3) Encourage him to save (to move out) by matching some savings. \"You save $X every month and we will match $Y.\" Help him make a budget for how much he needs in savings  to move on. Show him it will take a year to do it and how much he needs to save every month.\n\n(4) And the hardest thing: *Let him fail.*  Let him not have enough money for the things his friends have, or gas to go out or $$ for a new game, etc. When he moves out, let him miss a rent payment (even if you help him later) so he gets that feeling - of missing a rent payment! He needs to feel some pain so he wants to work to avoid it. Let him feel a little pain. It will help him.",

If you can't even manifest the dream of a future where you have control over your life, you aren't going to spend 30 years grinding for it.\n\nThe point i guess i would try to point out is that we are at a breaking point of society.

To ignore this environment by looking to your own personal past will leave you unable to comprehend where we are heading right now as a society. Your past was just that, the past.\n\nTry to talk to the person with the understanding that he doesn't see a future for himself. He doesn't see a viable option for his life forward.

            "This sounds very similar to what I went through when I was struggling as a late teen. My greatest problem at the time was that my dad didn't understand where I was, thinking all I wanted to do was play video games locked away in my room forever, and he would try to punish me for it, failing to realize that the smallest little shrivel of a social life I garned through video games online, and the brief disconnect from my daily reality, was where 95% of my will to live came from.\n\nIt's not that I didn't want to do something with my life, it's just that I needed more time to mentally get there and deal with my deepset anxieties, and I did, just as I said I would to my dad, all along. Years later and he admits he didn't know what I needed and apologized for misunderstanding where I was at that dark point of my life and making things harder for me when I needed the opposite.\n\nI know the situation won't be exactly the same with your son, but if if the parallels I do see are at all indicative of his mental state, all I can say is the worst thing you can do is threaten your son with things that will make his life harder than he already perceives it to be. Try instead to guide him to things that might help him make small but significant productive steps to achieving what he needs to. This can be finding therapists and offering to make an appointment for him (NOT making him scour for them himself, he needs his hand held at this stage and likely wouldn't do it himself), helping him with filling out the financial aid (the FAFSA really isn't that difficult to fill, he again just needs some hand holding for now), taking what you know about what he likes and finding way to spark his passion in related hobbies (taking a personal interest and showing your support), and, most of all, LISTENING to how he feels about himself and his life. I didn't want to be stuck in the position I was in at that age, and I'm willing to bet he doesn't either, but what he needs is compassion, understanding, and sincere, sustained support to get through it, not punishment.\n\nNobody asks to be brought into this world. Some of us struggle with existing more than others, and it can take some doing to find our footing. Nobody has to be at blame, but we should recognize that we each have a different path to finding our balance here on earth.",

The reality is that means those possibilities are not possibilities and there actually isn't all that much choice in what you do with your life.\n\nI try to think that a lifetime of pain and suffering may (has the potential to) bring some joys and in the end I'll die and it won't matter either way if I suffered through life or not. That makes me keep going. I know it could sound like the complete opposite, and that is true, it doesn't matter in the end, but that's the point. Whether your life ends right now or in 60 years, the only difference is you MIGHT experience good things during the latter. May as well keep doing whatever you need to right now to keep going.\n\nHe sounds like he needs help with these struggles.

If that\u2019s what honestly interests him, how can he use that interest to get a job & what does that job require to get the job (degree, internship, etc)? Being a play tester is something he can do now that has low pay but can wet the whistle of what could be. \n\nI spent HOURS of the day every day watching cartoons on TV.

Something that means getting up in the morning and doing something. \n\nI was unemployed and trapped in a cycle of just playing video games and letting the months slip by.

I would make the rent a token amount since he\u2019s unemployed, but enough of an amount that would mean he would have to work at least one day a week to pay it and still have some left over money. \n\nI\u2019d also encourage him to try different types of jobs and to focus on what the job gives him rather than if he\u2019s passionate about it. He can keep his passion for gaming after work. \n\nFor example I\u2019m not at all passionate about my job, but I like a job that keeps me active, gives me more than 2 days off a week and where I don\u2019t have to talk to people all day/can be autonomous. \n\nMaybe he just doesn\u2019t like the 9-5 grind.

            "23 year old man here, I\u2019ve been in his shoes.\n\nWhen I was in high school I was exactly this. My parents were very alarmed, I did nothing but game and get fat. They were in exactly your shoes.\n\nA few months before my exam period I was hit with a sudden jab of anxiety about my future and what would happen to me. This propelled me to work hard and do well in high school. Now I\u2019m a graduate student at a very good university, set to do my PhD.\n\nI was lucky that I possessed the internal desire to do well and not disappoint my family, but I understand not everyone does. I think your son is struggling from a lack of need to succeed. After all, why should he? He\u2019s getting fed and enjoying video games, which are getting very good. It sounds like you haven\u2019t been very hard on him so the benefits are much higher than the costs, why should he change. \n\nWhat your son needs in my opinion, though I could be wrong, is something like the following:\n\nFirstly, he needs to know that his apathy and laziness is hurting you. No child, except for a very rare exception, will not feel compelled to act differently if they find our they\u2019re hurting their parents. You need to explain your scared he won\u2019t do well, and that you love him but right now you feel like you\u2019ve failed him. That you just want to see him try at something, no matter what it is, because you know he has it in him. \n\nSecondly, you need to be harder on him. DON\u2019T kick him out of anything sudden, this will probably make him think \u2018fuck it\u2019 and flip the script. Instead, make it increasingly clear that his lifestyle is not acceptable. For instance. Tell him cooked dinners are earned by people who work, encourage him to get a job and keep it. Make sure he knows he\u2019s still loved and has a home, but that it needs to be conditional on him pulling his weight. \n\nThirdly, don\u2019t put restrictions on what he does. As someone who loves university, I\u2019ve taught enough students to know it\u2019s a terrible choice for most people. I have a friend who went from severely depressed to elated when they dropped out of university and began to work, it\u2019s seriously not important. What is important is that your son contends his nihilism with something he finds meaningful. Encourage him to find something. A job, an apprenticeship, working at a suicide hotline, volunteering. Something that he can find meaning in and use to build good habits. You\u2019d be surprised how amenable someone is to be told that they must find something to do, as long as they have boundless limitations as to what exactly they\u2019re allowed to find. \n\nPeople mistakenly thing that passions are spontaneous and precede action. It\u2019s not correct. Passion comes after action, motivation happens after that first step. He needs to find something he likes, then the meaning will follow. \n\nMake sure he saves at least 1/3 to 1/2 of his money, make it a condition of him living there. It\u2019s a pretty sweet deal, and if he wants to say \u2018fuck you\u2019 and leave he\u2019ll spend that much on rent anyway. Saving money is a great way to foster future considerations, people who save are people who plan for the tomorrow which helps them become better people with meaningful lives. I honestly think not saving for the future is one of the worst things people can do for their mental health. \n\nObviously this is all just my opinion, but I personally would have found this helpful for me. I didn\u2019t want to study, I went to university to appease my parents and discovered a passion for my subject. The most important thing is to do something, don\u2019t push university on him. But encourage some alternative instead. Currently it likely feels like he either hates life for a 4 year degree or makes you unhappy and he\u2019s throwing in with the latter. There\u2019s no need to embrace this dichotomy, there are plenty of noble and worthwhile pursuits that don\u2019t require tertiary education.\n\nSo in conclusion:\n\nYou need to be stricter in a manner that gently guides him towards something he finds meaningful. Once he finds something that puts a jig in his step, everything else will follow.\n\nI wish you and your family all the best!!",
            "The first question here is: Can you afford to support him right now? If you can't, then you need to treat him like an adult and explain to him the financial situation.\n\nIf you can afford to support him, and his behavior is otherwise okay (he cleans up after himself, treats you both with kindness, etc) then I would just try to keep talking to him. Get him therapy if he feels he needs it. Maybe encourage him to pursue a dream or a creative endeavor.\n\nHe's absolute right though. The world sucks and there is no joy or benefit to be found from being a cog in an endless unstoppable machine that demands your servitude but gives nothing in return.\n\nTry to find out what his hopes are. What his interests are. If you have the financial flexibility to give him a future that offers more than just a soul crushing 9-to-5, then you owe it to him to do that.

            "As someone who spent much of his life playing videogames, I think it's a chicken and egg situation with depression. Playing games all day makes you depressed and because you're depressed you play games all day. It's also a tough time in one's life when you haven't figured out what you want to do and it's easy to slip into nihilism.\n\nBut make no mistake games are a drug and the addiction to videogames has many correlations with drug addiction, including cravings, withdrawal and the social trap of all ones friends being addicted too with no escape. I stopped for a good while and I've never been happier, I wouldn't describe any of my friends that are still in that lifestyle as happy.\n\nThere isn't really an easy answer, you can send him to therapy but unless he engages with it himself it will make no difference, no matter how good the therapist is. At the end of the day he has to help himself.\n\nI think some tough love is required, explain to him that he needs to get a job and do something if he wants to stay under your roof. That doesn't mean kicking him out if he doesn't but it could mean more drastic measures like taking away the internet or otherwise making it impossible for him to sit and game all day. He needs to break the cycle in some way and sometimes that requires outside intervention. Explain that gaming would be ok if it was a couple hours a day but his current lifestyle is not sustainable.\n\nLife is better with a bit of discomfort. Gaming is better when you only get your couple hours a day to enjoy it. Jobs can actually be enjoyable, they can give purpose, social interaction and can give that dopamine hit that we all crave. The whole \"wake up, go to work, come home, sleep repeat\" trope is forgetting all the interesting challenges that happen in between.",

Excessive, social encounters, nutritious food and most important of all meaning.\n\nThe second thing, which I don't know if it's true in general, is that we habe no idea about what a job consist of before we get out there and look for yourselves. \n\nGive your son the tools he needs to try out different professions, make sure get his needs met and I'm confident he will flourish.\n\nIt might be to much for him to do it all at once, so start a new thing every week and for the love of god don't forbid him to use some of his time at his PC, it is possibly the last safe place he feels he have in the world right now.",
            "So usually when I see a thread with this many comments I don't even bother because it's like everything has already been said.\n\nI'll just say, from my own personal experience pretty much being in a similar position as your son, my perspective. I'm in my mid-30s now and went through the same thing at 23.\n\nI think, one, it sounds like he's pretty close to getting his shit together. He was close to going to college. He said that the financial assistance thing was difficult to figure out. Don't just pretend that he's making that up. It might legitimately be confusing for him.\n\nTypically people who do a lot of gaming have problems with executive functioning. He might need someone to help him go through the process.\n\nAnd I think college is a really great idea for someone like that. I was around 23 when I started going to college too, and I eventually graduated from a good university. College really helps for those of us who sometimes struggle with executive functioning because it provides structure to the whole process of learning.\n\nAnd the thing about not liking jobs, like, I think that's pretty normal. Most low-level jobs are demeaning. Why would anyone want to do that for the rest of their life? I don't really think there's anything wrong with that. But he needs to take his dissatisfaction with that aspect of life and use it as motivation to achieve a life that he can be comfortable with.\n\nLike I said before, I think he's close.\n\nAnd college, if he goes as an adult, gets tied to his own income which is probably close to nothing, meaning FAFSA will cover his tuition. And then he can take out loans for living expenses if he needs to.\n\nCollege will be great not just for the education and the job prospects and structure, but to give him a taste of true independence, to be able to have his own place, buy his own food, do his own thing. And that experience of independence can serve to motivate someone to pursue it more in the future rather than just hanging out at home.\n\nIf my parents kicked me out at that age, I am not sure if I would have ever went to college and got my shit together. I think it is possible that I would have sunk into an even lower place than I already was at.\n\nNext thing I want to say is that you don't need to shame him for his hobbies. It's OK to be really into video games. We don't shame other people for their hobbies in the same way that people like to shame people for playing video games. Maybe video games are his passion. Maybe that's what he should be focusing on. The gaming industry is highly lucrative and there are plenty of jobs. My parents always made me feel like shit for enjoying the things that I enjoyed, and I don't think that was ever the right attitude to have. That kind of shame sticks with you.\n\nAnd the last thing I would say is that people who are spending that much time in a room playing video games should really get outdoors and see the real world out there. I played video games because I grew up in the middle of nowhere and felt trapped in a small town during long winters.\n\nWhen I became an adult, I started traveling and exploring and now I pretty much live in the wilderness and am super into nature, and it's changed my life for the better, and I am happier than ever.\n\nEven if he's uncomfortable in a traditional work environment, there's a lot of remote possibilities out there as well... I mean, life doesn't have to be the life that people imagine where you work a 9-5 in the office and struggle in the rat race. A different life is possible. You just need to figure it out.",

Apparently all they were giving employers was effectively gibberish the whole time I was using it. Now the only thing I'll do is email my formatted resume file directly to employers myself, along with a quick introduction and cover letter if appropriate.

Asking your ethnicity, age, and other details that place people into protected classes allow organizations, and outside observers, to see over time how their policies are impacting groups of people. \n\nIt's also used for programs where they want to achieve a level of diversity. Being able to look at a glance over raw numbers of applicants / accepted applicants can give great insight into how diverse both sets are and they can then tailor marketing /outreach to achieve better numbers.\n\nThat they do this using information self identified by the applicant is actually better.

            "I might have the answer you're looking for.\n\nThere have been several economic papers that were studied discrimination in the workplace. Many studies had their original theory be that by removing ethnicity from an application would decrease discrimination and allow more minorities to get jobs. However what they found was that when ethnicity was removed, the probability of minorities being hired actually decreased. This was attributed to employers no longer being able to give le-way to minorities, or value their achievements higher. In other words, generally minorities have to overcome more and have a harder path to get the same result as someone that's not a minority. So if a minority's grade average was a 7/10 and a non-minority's grade average was 7/10, the minority would generally get hired as a 7/10 was perceived to be harder to get for the minority. Building on this, minorities were also statistically more likely to have gaps in there resume which employers would be more understanding to if the applicant was a minority. \n\nAn example for grades is Harvard's grade requirements for different ethnicities. Native Americans have a much lower grade requirement than other ethnicities to get into Harvard. Is this partly because Harvard wants Native American students? Partly. But it's also because Native Americans have some of the hardest times getting a good education. Hence since even though two people are equally gifted and give equal effort, they may get different grades depending on their ethnicity, and employers attempt to account for that to get the best applicant. \n\nI can't find the exact study that I want to quote, but here is one of the sources that talk about the same thing as I mentioned\n\n[https://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/discrimination-hiring-and-anonymous-cvs-france-cv-anonymes](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/discrimination-hiring-and-anonymous-cvs-france-cv-anonymes)\n\nHere is their first paragraph from their results:\n\n## Results and policy lessons\n\nMaking resumes anonymous did not affect the average number of interviews and job offers volunteer firms made, the length of the hiring process, or the use of other recruitment channels, but it reduced the likelihood that firms interview and hire minority candidates.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope this is something like the answer you were looking for :)",

The other 50% of applicants are blues, and of those only 10% are hired. Hypothesis: this company's hiring manager is really discriminating against blues and favoring reds.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nScenario 2: 90% of applicants are reds, and of those reds 50% are hired. Only 10% of applicants are blues, but of those blue applicants also 50% are hired. Hypothesis: this company is not inherently discriminating, there are just a lot fewer blues applying for some reason (whether it's because lack of education, cultural or societal reasons, etc.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, it is a ambivalent issue. On the one hand, like you said, if everyone keeps drawing attention to your ethnicity, it just seems to emphasize it more, leading to more opportunities to be discriminated against. On the other hand, if nobody collects any data on ethnicity, then people can still be discriminated when face to face, and nobody would have any idea that it is happening, how often and how prevalent, what might be the cause and how we can fix it.",

The diversity forms will show if they're only getting white applicants, or if they're getting a diverse range. It's separated from the form so that it can't be used by racists or homophobes to only hire white / straight people (or to tick an arbitrary diversity box), similar to how in the UK it's not normal to put your photo (or age) on your CV. \n\nIt's worth adding that it might not be a conscious bias that people are only interviewing/hiring white people / English sounding names.

Without accountability, businesses could get away with intentional prejudice. They could also get away with never bothering to look for unintentional prejudice in their hiring methods. For example, they might never notice that applicants with female and ethnic names are selected drastically less often even when the rest of the resum\u00e9 is identical to ones submitted by applicants with male, European names. All since they wouldn't know about the problem, they'd claim that they were all for equality.\n\nFurthermore, being entirely \"race blind\" prevents the pursuit of *equity*, which many if not most people think is required for *equality*. (Note: Plenty of people also see equity as being a separate state from equality instead of being a requirement that separates equality-in-name-only from true equality. That's fine! Whichever way of thinking about it makes more sense to you, the fundamental values are the same.) For example, if an ethnic group's community has a different way of speaking/writing that throws off some automated resum\u00e9 scoring algorithms, then that can only be accounted for (and discovered in the first place) by knowing when applicants belong to that ethnic group's community. Ideally the algorithm will be changed to make this unnecessary, but that's much easier said than done.

Most food allergies are actually intolerances that wildly swing in how they impact a person.  Garlic is one of the few enzymes that can't be produced in a lab for humans to consume garlic.

            "I\u2019ve been very sick for the last 5 years and have spent about 5 months total in hospital in the last year. One Wednesday in mid-February earlier this year, I was feeling really rough at home one afternoon, so called my GP who arranged for me to be admitted. I remember phoning my husband to come home from work to drive me to the hospital then starting to pack a bag, then nothing. \n\nI remember \u2018waking up\u2019, but it was like sleep paralysis - so I couldn\u2019t move, or even open my eyes, but I was aware of myself and in particular, just how hard it was to breathe; I felt like I was pulling air in through thick layers of scratchy, heavy sackcloth and I just couldn\u2019t get enough air and felt the familiar stirrings of a panic attack. \n\nI was utterly terrified and became convinced I was going to suffocate right there. All I could do was focus on pulling as much air into me with each breath as I could, it hurt so badly, my chest was burning with the effort and all I could think was:\n\n\u201cYou can do it, you have to do it, you can do it, you have to do it...\u201d\n\nI was repeating it over and over in my head, in time with my attempts at breathing. It felt like it was going on forever and although it was still hard to breathe, I managed to settle into a kind of pattern and I was able to calm down a little. I must have passed back out because the next thing I remember was \u2018waking up\u2019, same sleep paralysis feeling and my breathing was still a battle for each breath. As if the words had been repeating in my head as I slept, they started going again: \u201cYou can do it, you have to do it. You can do it, you have to do it...\u201d etc.\n\nThe pattern continued, with me feeling as if I was spending periods awake, struggling for breath and then passing out for a bit and repeating those words over and over. \n\nWhen I eventually woke up properly, I found I was in the Intensive Care Unit and had been unconscious for 5 days with SEPSIS and Pneumonia and hadn\u2019t been expected to make it - they\u2019d even had my children (10 & 12 years old) in to say goodbye. My recovery has been slow and the whole ordeal has left me very anxious and with severe lung damage - so COVID couldn\u2019t have come at a better time for me, as you can imagine! However, I now find that when my chest feels tight, either through some exertion or due to anxiety, then repeating that \u201cYou can do it, you have to do it...\u201d phrase does wonders in calming me down. It makes me focus on my breathing, which helps to get a panic attack under control and I\u2019ve found that it works at helping me to calm down if I feel really stressed - it helps me to feel more in control. \n\nTLDR: Was unconscious in ICU and repeating a phrase in my head helped me to breathe and now, 4 months later, repeating it helps to ease panic attacks and help me feel in control.",

They are considered a minority because they have less access to social resources, namely money, prestige, and power.  \n\nIt is actually statistically accurate to say that overweight women are a minority as they tend to have a lower income and certainly lower prestige than non-overweight women. Overweight women are less likely to marry (so just one earner in the house), and if they do marry their spouse is likely to have a lower income than their non-overweight counterparts. Overweight women do not rise as high in the workforce as their slimmer counterparts, too. You are also less likely to see overweight women in power positions as well.  Can you name a heavy female CEO or governmental leader as easily as a male?\n\nFor men there is a little bit of a wider window in terms of what is considered acceptable (or shameful) as a body size. There is not as strong a correlation between overweight and minority status for men, but it is there.

            "I never ever even ever considered any other way. You are correct, and a good person. This is why Penne is good for first dates. Easy pasta to eat, just jam that fork spline in there, and you're good to go. WAYYYY better than spaghetti.",
            "TIL what tines are",
            "I use my tongue.",
            "You aren\u2019t weird. I do that too and it\u2019s incredible. Penne is the goat.",
            "Is there an alternative I've not found yet?",

            "All of the above",
            "I attempt this, but I usually eat penne out of a bowl so it's difficult",
            "I do sometimes",
            "I do it and i grab multiples lmao",
            "I do that with macaroni too!",
            "TIL tines",
            "Yes, you are not weird.",
            "I definitely do it once in a while, but if I'm really hungry I just go stabbing away. I think for me, it also  comes down to the current positioning of the penne/ziti \u2013 if it's an ideal layout with a few pieces neatly laying parallel, then I'd be more likely to go with a slide.",
            "always time for chopsticks.",

            "It works best with chopsticks, you can scoop extra sauce in between the pasta",
            "No, but I eat black olives 5 at a time slipped over my fingertips.",
            "Anyone who doesn\u2019t eat tube shaped pasta this way is a weirdo.",
            "Yes I line them up on the fork twines and try to swallow them whole! :)",
            "I thought that was the proper way already? Why would you stab your food like an psychopath?",
            "...yes",
            "Edward macaroni fork.",
            "Nah that\u2019s not weird. One time at a party when I was younger, I saw one of the kid\u2019s moms eating penne by cutting a single penne noodle in half with her fork, then spearing both halves of the noodle one on top of the other, then eating the single stacked noodle in one bite. \n\nMe the little asperger\u2019s 12 year old I was, I literally turned to my own mom and asked her why in the holy mother of shit this woman would add several extra steps to eating penne pasta. I needed some sort of explanation because my feeble mind couldn\u2019t handle what I was seeing. I never got that explanation and this is now a core memory for me.",
            "Ofcourse we all do that!",
            "Of course other people do this?, did you think you were the only one to ever do this?",
            "Sometimes I try and get them loaded up sideways on the fork like a pyramid of logs",

            "Ye",
            "This is the only way I eat them.",
            "Oh, yeah.  The only way to go.",
            "I actually don\u2019t like it when the pasta gets on the fork that way. Makes me feel like the noodles are telling me how to do my job",
            "No, I do too, it\u2019s fun. Keep on keepin on",
            "Is there any other way?",
            "Slide the pasta first then stab it so it doesn't fall off the fork",
            "I do that if it keeps on slipping away when I try to stab it",
            "My Kids do That.",
            "I do it too then I get tired and just use a spoon like a toddler that toddles",

            "thats how i eat it.",
            "You're weird but I do it too, so it's normal.\n\nYou're welcome",
