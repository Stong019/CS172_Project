All pharmacists must pass the same board exams before they can practice, so there is a base level of proficiency that we all share. This makes personality and interpersonal skills more important. On the other hand, in my state there is no minimum level of education or training for pharmacy technicians (beyond a high-school diploma). I have met many techs who are extremely skilled at their jobs, and as a result are able to get away with being difficult to work with.\n\nNow if you're asking what I personally look for in coworkers, it's a balance of both personality and proficiency. While this may seem like a cop-out answer, it's true. I've worked with some incredibly kind pharmacists who will stop everything they are doing and spend long periods of time (sometimes 20+ minutes) just talking to a patient, resulting in me having to do the work of two pharmacists by myself which can be frustrating. I've also worked with technicians who can fill a hundred scripts in under an hour, but later I'll have to deal with patient complaints because the tech was being rude.

Everyone but her couldn't stop working for a second without her barking at us \"Time to lean, time to clean!\" but she talks to a customer or the boss for 5 minutes and it's fine. She'd tell us to go faster which was annoying af bc if I could I *would*. She acted like her shit don't stink. She put us down in front of customers, the \"these guys aren't as good as me\" shit. And yes she was ONLY a coworker, she wasn't above me, she was just annoying. I literally don't give two fucking shits how easy she made our nights by being good at working, I dreaded working with her so much.  I hated how she made me (and everyone) feel like shit for not being as good as her. I hope she's happy wherever she is, but God fucking bless her poor coworkers, and I'm not even religious.\n\nMy favorite people are the ones who are good at their job and also really nice. I have a few people who work with me like that and I love them. I'm average at my job but most people like me because I try to get along with people (and my retail persona is very good).

That\u2019s game development when it\u2019s bad.\n\nNow imagine the group project where it\u2019s all your friends. You all have specific things to do and the teacher is giving you creative freedom to do it your way; write a song, make a video, do illustrations. You get some pizzas and hang out at your friends house and it\u2019s great! That\u2019s game development when it\u2019s good.\n\nI have repeatedly seen artists far more talented than me be passed over because they are entitled jerks. I have, without question, been given numerous opportunities because people tend to like working with me/being around me.\n\nObviously all of this can go to far and you can see how things like nepotism or \u201cfrat house\u201d atmospheres can easily occur. \n\nThere\u2019s a time to get down to business and no amount of \u201cfun\u201d will ever cover someone\u2019s utter incompetence. You want to work with your friends but you also want to work with people who are talented and motivated because if the game bombs then you all lose your jobs no matter how fun it was.\n\nThere are people who are utter asshats who can get by on talent alone. But they are rare.\n\nFor the rest of us mortals practically speaking just don\u2019t be a jerk. Be friendly, courteous, and helpful; be someone *you\u2019d* want to work with.",

Someone who makes mistakes but fixes them when pointed out, is polite, and works hard is what makes someone a good coworker.",

            "I don't work in computers, but this is definitely true.\n\nSomeone who's mediocre at their job gets their job done to the minimum viable standard. So they're completing their work duties. So they're not holding *you* back in any way, shape, or form. Sure, they're not offering you extra help with your work, but they're not causing you trouble either. If that person is pleasant, you will only be positively inclined towards them.\n\nTake your rockstar dick worker. They get their work done to a much higher standard, probably even higher than yours. And what do they do with their other time? They're a dick. So they'll spend their time annoying coworkers, badgering bosses, crying about how nobody else works to their standard... They'll create a negative work environment, which will harm everyone's productivity. If they're so good that they can carry the whole department on the back of their own talent, despite bringing the team's productivity down, then that's just going to harm people's self-esteem. As in 'what am I even doing here, when Rob the Knob can do everyone's job for them?'.\n\nThe person you spoke to is 100% correct. You want job security? Be good *enough* at your job and be pleasant to be around. The higher-ups don't really care about *who* stays in what position, they care about saving costs. The people who decide whether you get hired or fired tend to be the people immediately above you. They don't care about your productivity (it's the higher-ups who care about that), they care about their team. If you're good for the team, you'll usually keep your job. Even if the people above your immediate bosses are the ones doing the hiring and firing, your immediate bosses will probably make the case for keeping you vs. some other mediocre employee if you're pleasant enough. Or they'll advocate for more chances for you etc.\n\nOr look at it this way. The guys who invented Google offered to sell their technology to Yahoo for 3 million dollars. Google was far and away better than Yahoo, and they knew it, and could prove it. Yahoo turned them down, because they didn't like being told 'your search engine is crap, you should buy ours'. This is back in the days where you could literally search for last night's football match results, naming both teams, and the official record for the match results was the third or fourth link, if you were lucky, and Google was consistently getting the right links as their top results. Night and day quality difference, bargain price, turned down because they felt the sellers were unpleasant.\n\nBe pleasant, be safe :)",
            "I mean from the perspective of coworkers it's absolutely true. And in this job that I've been part of hiring for other positions randomly, all the side questions are just to let people decide if you are friendly enough and their type of friend. So there's a basic skills test in general, but people prefer the pleasant. Some bosses would prefer the asshole.\n\nAlso, coworkers will tend to sabotage the asshole.",

I will say first, yes, some of us take shit WAYYY too far, are absolutely insufferable and most importantly, actually detract from the quality of their contribution as a result. That said, I will tell you this very harshly and plainly from my point of view - if the feeling of being an imposter doesn\u2019t subside FUCK fake it till you make it - that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s wrong with modern people - WE\u2019RE FRAUDS. This doesn\u2019t mean at all you\u2019re \u201cnot cut out\u201d for it, it means your not there yet, and here\u2019s a newsflash - all those assholes, including me, were once in the same boat. So, you might get a lot of other advice here, but mine would be this - if you can accept that you\u2019re very green and somewhat unprepared, and approach the situation from a place of humility - that recognizes that your current place is based on a promise of continued development - you will be one of us someday. If you follow most of the advice here, and focus on whether or not people \u201clike\u201d you, you may be able to stay employed - but the feeling of being a pretender will never fully leave, instead you\u2019ll be assuring people that it\u2019s normal to feel incompetent. Worse than that whatever you were looking for in choosing a difficult career will not materialize. I work with people like this, I\u2019m always professional and usually pretty polite (if - I concede - a bit dismissive at times) - but when someone with a masters degree comes to a high school dropout for help, I genuinely see the shame and uncertainty in their face and hear it in their voice - it\u2019s not about me - I feel bad for them. Don\u2019t do this to yourself. Accept that you\u2019re green and you will improve - believe you don\u2019t need to, and you\u2019ll end up a beggar with a fake smile... just my 2 cents",

            "Why aren\u2019t people sick of sports? My mother has watched the same team play the same game for decades. Why aren\u2019t people sick of romantic comedies? Action movies? Pop music? Romance novels?\n\nFor every genre there are a ton of people who love them.\n\nEDIT: I keep getting the same response, so I\u2019m just going to answer it here. \u201cSports aren\u2019t predetermined, you don\u2019t know who\u2019ll win\u201d\n\nMy mum loves cricket. So let\u2019s look at that. Team A will send in a bowler. He\u2019ll throw the ball. Because of the rules of the sport, as well as the limitations of physics and human physiology, he\u2019ll throw it in one of half a dozen ways. The batsman will try to hit the ball. Once again, there are a limited number of ways to do that. Then he\u2019ll run between the stumps while the fielders try to catch the ball and get him out. Once they\u2019ve done that six times, they\u2019ll send in a different bowler. Once they\u2019ve done that 50 times, or gotten 10 batters out, Team B will bowl. \n\nAnd every single ball will look like that. \n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s a massive oversimplification!\u201d Yes it is. And so is \u201cthe hero will always win\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not a fan of cricket, and all I see is the same cycle of throw the ball, hit the ball, run done again and again and again. Every single ball is almost identical to the one before and the one after. And I wonder how can anyone enjoy this? But a cricket fan will see how each bowler bowls a little differently. Each batsman responds differently. Each fielder reacts differently. You\u2019ll see a world of fun and variation where I see only the repetition. \n\nI look at superhero movies and see that The Batman focused on the detective side, while Love and Thunder went cosmic, No Way Home lent heavily into nostalgia, and Multiverse of Madness embraced the weird! These were all very different movies to me, and the fact that they were all released close together doesn\u2019t effect how much a fan enjoys them. But someone like OP who obviously isn\u2019t a fan just sees the same powered individual fights a villain and saves the world formula repeated again and again. \n\nThis is true of *all* entertainment. Cop shows, Rom-Coms, music, books, sports, superheroes. Everything has its repetitive elements that make it seem boring to those who aren\u2019t fans. \n\nEDIT 2: formatting",
            "I\u2019m sick of them. Also tired of Star Wars movies. Too many of them, it\u2019s causing fatigue. I loved comics and Star Wars and was pumped when they started making new content for both but now it feels like a chore to watch them and I\u2019m just no longer interested in either.\n\nI\u2019d probably be less fatigued if they\u2019d do more interesting stories and characters. I\u2019m so tired of the Avengers at this point. It\u2019s been like 15 years of Avengers. I really wish Image comics would get into the movie/tv business, i think more than anything I have marvel/dc/Star Wars fatigue.

            "Same reason no one is sick of any movie genre. There's no reason to be. It's just a type of movie that people enjoy watching with each one giving a different experience and a different story. \n\nNow if you're talking specifically Marvel, they connect their projects in a way to keep audiences invested. Pretty much a grand tv show at that point.",

            "My glib answer is: your question is like asking why aren't audiences sick of action, science fiction, or romance movies yet.\n\nMy second glib answer is: your question is based on the current supply of *Marvel* superhero movies. The MCU is like 80% of the current superhero movie market right now; their next competitor, DC film universe, is far behind in success, clout, and how much attention people pay to them.\n\nMy more realistic answer is: people aren't sick of them because they're still fun and interesting. Obviously, everyone has a different threshold of just how much they consider superhero movies fun and interesting. I personally know friends who never jumped on the superhero movie train, so their threshold was zero movies. I myself remained highly excited all the way to the latest \"Thor: Love and Thunder\", which is the 29th movie of the MCU. I am still excited to see the new Marvel films.\n\nTo help you better find your answer, you should look into why the Western genre (e.g. \"3:10 to Yuma\", Clint Eastwood's \"A Fistful of Dollars\") went away.

Now, 20 years later, the same movies are being marketed (and enjoyed by) not only to kids, but to young adults as well.\n\nI don't think this is an individual thing - it's not that having insecure housing and insecure jobs makes you like superhero movies - instead it's a culture shift.

            "As a war survivor (4 years Sarajevo siege) I can tell you that you can't plan that shit because every war is different, but if you have to, then firstly I'd put duct tape or similar tape on your windows in a triple cross pattern directly onto the glass. If the windows shatter due to the blast the tape will keep them more or less in one piece and this will prevent injury to a certain extent. In case of close military conflict in the area you need to close all the gas to your house at the main valve. Find one of those hanging wallets that you put around your neck and keep all your documents there, passport, IDs, etc. \n\nIf you have any valuables try and stash them in a good place (honestly, I'd dig them somewhere outdoors and share the location with someone i trust in case I don't make it) \n\nDepending on where you live (block or a separate house) and if you are civilian or military, you will need to know the place where to hide in case od shelling, usually underground. Be it ready made facilities or basements/underground parkings etc., and you need to have a kit of items with you at all times: flash light, small radio receiver with good batteries (remember that most probably everything will be cut including TV and the internet, and your only source of information will be radio, high calorie, no expiry food such as nuts, dark chocolate, dried meat, cans etc., candles, a lot of candles, good lighter or even a few of them, batteries, board games, playing cards (sometimes the emergency lasts for days and it can take a lot of time between the attacks), also it would be good to have some kind of small weapon with you even if you are just a civilian. \n\nOne of the things I remember we missed a lot during the war was yeast for bread making. We used to burn books from our private libraries to cook meals, and also burn wooden flooring to cook and heat. \n\nNot sure what your situation is, but try avoiding alcohol, during those times, even though it will be tempting. \n\nI dunno what else to say except that wars are horrible and there are no words to describe the horror that is left in souls and hearts of those who survive them. I truly hope the situation will de-escalate and that you will not have to do any of the things mentioned above.",
            "As someone who's gone thru something similar also in Eastern Europe in the 90s here's some practical advice to get you thru:\n\n\n1) A running joke at that time but also 100% accurate is: \"You just need 2 things to survive, your life and your passport\".\n\n\nHave your documents ready. Passport is king, but university/high school/education diplomas/immunization records...Anything that vouchers for who you are what you have accomplished will help you get thru borders or refugee camps or visas. If you leave your place and you can carry only one thing it's documentation.\n\n\n2) Fill up your bathroom tub with water. You can drain it as needed for personal hygiene as long as you have running water but always have it full afterwards if you do not know when you're going to lose it. \n\n\n3) go get gasoline. Fill up your car if you have one. And buy canisters and fill them up. Gas is worth more than gold when stations run dry. And they will. People will kill each other over it so hide it and don't tell anyone you have it. You can use it for your own needs, you can sell it later, you can trade it. Cash won't be worth much as inflation is going to render cash worthless. Gas will be the new cash. And if you did put it in your vehicle someone will siphon it out quickly. So hide the car too :)\n\n\n4) go get candles. Better and cheaper than batteries. Can be somewhat reused as long as you keep the wax.\n\n\n5) go buy a tub of lard. It's winter so it'll keep for a while if power runs out and shouldn't be expensive now. Get lots of crackers and if you can, paprika powder. Crackers + lard + paprika = tons of calories and tastes ok. You can also take this stuff with you if you need to make a getaway.\n\n\n6) list is getting long and there are many nice to haves but your life is most important so if you can get one more thing get bags of nuts. Walnuts/peanuts/whatever-you-can get-your-hands-on nuts = calories (and they won't spoil)\n\n\nNow you have water and calories and light. With gas and paperwork you're better off than most people in the same situation. So be careful who you share that with.\n\nLast note to hopefully put your mind at ease, the invading force will go after militarily targets first. Stay clear and you'll be relatively safe. If you find that you must run...lie, cheat and trust very few (if any) as you make your run. Unless there are genocidal atrocities (rare, but happen) you will make it.\n\nThis sucks. I hope it doesn\u2019t happen to you. But you will make it. Good luck to you my friend.",

Consider everything you will need for three days without supplies in the kit. You can usually assume that you'll be able to find water and shelter, so select for water purifying, one change of clothing, and food.

Chasers and shooters focus on runners. Unless we're dealing with a sniper.\n9- Stock up on wet wipes. They can help a lot if water is cut off for days.\n10- Avoid arguments with the family.

            "Op, alot of these prepper questions are really good suggestions for overall survival situations and failure of infastructure.  However, a war zone is completely different.  Preperations mean nothing if a 2000 pounder lands anywhere near the block you live on. Or random mortar or missile attacks to harass normal day living. Before even prepping, why not look long and hard on why you should stay.  Whats keeping you in that location that you cant do elsewhere?  If war doesnt break out, you can always come back.  I would recommend figuring out a place you can go first and make a plan to get there and what you'll do when you get there.  Then stock up on canned goods, water, basic medical kit, and a way to cook food.  A water purification system of some kind is great as well but should not be used to bunker down with.  If your infastructure cant provide water and your running low on it, then that should be a good sign to leave.  Just my 2 cents since no one seems to be mentioning that a war zone is significantly different from just a failure of infrastructure or extended camping trips.",
            "Buy some white sheets to drape outside your windows. This shows people that there *are* people in the house and they are non-combatants. It may help prevent soldiers (from both sides) targeting your house on purpose, but sadly, nothing will help prevent stray shots.\n\nIf you have a basement/root cellar and there's room enough, place some sleeping bags down there, a space heater, some bottled water, and some dried food. If fighting starts near you, get in there and stay in there.\n\nSupplies should include food, blankets, bottled water, warm jackets, warm boots, gloves, warm hats, socks, a backpack for each family member, flash lights and batteries, Copies of your personal identification (Driver's licenses, passports, school IDs, anything), matches, a hatchet for cutting wood, aspirin/basic pain reliever and fever reducer.\n\nI'd be careful with anything that is a weapon. While it may help protect you from your neighbors or other refugees seeking to take advantage of your situation, it may also mark you as a potential danger/combatant and could get you shot. In numerous wars, civilians with rifles were often seen as francs-tireurs or partisans and often arrested, executed, or driven away. This is generally frowned upon and often considered a war crime (unless you can prove that the partisan was shooting at you), but that's not much help for you, when you're shot just because you had a hunting rifle strapped to your back.\n\nYou want to make sure you can carry things and still walk, so don't over pack. But you need enough supplies (food and water) to get to somewhere \"Safe.\" That's going to depend wildly on where you are and how far you can walk. Ideally you can just stay in your home and avoid trouble, but worse case scenario, you need to leave.\n\nIt's winter there, and I live in Minnesota so I know a bit about cold winters. I won't go too much over it, you know it as well, but warm clothes, layers, jackets, and good gloves/mittens will go a long way in the cold. Avoid getting wet, and if your feet get wet, find a place to stop ASAP and get them both dry and warm. You may need to have multiple pairs of socks to prevent both frostbite as well as trench foot (a condition where the foot is trapped in cold, wet conditions and acquires a variety of terrible diseases and potentially can cost you your foot or even life).\n\nFinally, stock some cash somewhere. If not Cash, jewelry. Something light, portable, and valuable. You may need it to trade, barter, or bribe your way past checkpoints or to protect yourself or your family.",

            "I\u2019m certainly not an expert, and you\u2019ve gotten some good answers here so far! I wanted to add that in addition to planning for short term survival stuff in the event that water and electricity is cut out, I would plan for several months of difficulty getting most goods. \n\nSo for example, if the power were to suddenly go out and you were unable or unwilling to go outside, you of course want foods you can eat without cooking (lots of peanut butter and crackers would be good, applesauce, soups, granola bars, etc.) plenty of water, and I would probably prioritize warm clothing and maybe a small tent over a way to start a fire inside. An indoor fire can become quite dangerous. \n\nBut in addition to that stuff, sit down with your family and talk about what the necessary items are that you use over six months time, that would be very difficult or dangerous to go with out. Here I\u2019m talking about filling prescription medications for example, and ask for a three month supply maybe. Do you have women in the home who need to stock up on menstrual products? Do you need to stock up on birth control or condoms? Toilet paper, soap, trash bags, these are the types of things that might be tricky to get later if there are supply chain issues due to a conflict. \n\nIf you have children in the house, go grab plenty of crayons and coloring books, puzzles, legos, etc. the types of things that can occupy a lot of time if school is canceled. For adults, maybe get some board games like monopoly, chess, or checkers. Mental health is an important aspect of your wellbeing.  \n\nAnd then on an even more sobering note, I think anytime you anticipate conflict, you must be willing and equipped to walk a long distance. It could be to stores because gas is hard to come by, or it could be to another town, or even further\u2026. Make sure everyone in the family has good shoes, a new pack of socks that you do not open unless you have to leave, back pack for supplies, and a tent.",
            "I would suggest duct tape, cordage (rope, twine), tarps or a tent if you have one.  For heat you can create a micro climate in your apartment under the tarps or in the tent.

Obviously a hurricane is different from this but water is the one thing you must have. You could even make a tarp that captures rain water if you think it might get that extreme.",

            "heat, food, clean water, clean air, shelter, protection, and medical care\n\nYou need a plan for how you will be providing these things for yourself and any potential family. \n\nHeat - can be made with electricity, but it may not be available. Can you start a fire? Can you make your fire discreet? Do you have a box of matches or a ferro rod that will last? Where will you get burnable matter? \n\nFood - can be stored beforehand if you have a place to keep it. Ensure you can get back to this place if so. Small animal traps are incredibly reliable if the local ecosystem can support them.  You may need/be able to steal food from closed businesses or abandoned houses. If you have a firearm, you may be able to claim a larger animal. If you do, try to smoke it into basically jerky, that will last the longest without refrigeration. \n\nClean water - this is easy in the modern era. Worst case you can find running water, filter it through sand and moss, and boil it. Best case you can buy a lifestraw and they are good for like 10000 gallons of even the nastiest water or something. \n\nClean air - this may not apply depending on your circumstance. if you are going to bunker underground, this is priority #1. Bad air can kill you before you even realize it, snd it\u2019s invisible. \n\nShelter - are you going to bunker in a permanent location? If not, do you have a tent? Can you build a lean to shelter in the wilderness? Know where you can go in an emergency\n\nProtection, any weapon is better than no weapon, worst case you can find and sharpen a long stick. Guns are the best choice, provided you have ammo. Other than that a large knife is really solid. If you have a permanent shelter and are in danger of being attacked, taking the time to set traps is a great idea. \n\nLastly, medical care - stock up on common medicine if possible, bandages and a disinfectant are top tier life savers. Other than that this will vary wildly depending on the situation, so just make sure to keep it in mind. \n\n\nThe long story short is that there are a lot of ways to stay safe and provide for yourself. The big part is to have a plan, set it up before you need it, and be ready to execute at a moments notice.\n\nEdit: an emergency radio and some flares might be a good idea.",

They just give a steady stream of stuff vaguely related to what you actually want, but that they also get paid to show you. So you'll keep scrolling and clicking stuff. User experience and usefulness be damned, they're making a profit.\n\nThe end result is, you can't actually search for anything anymore.

There are many reasons why pockets are eliminated from women's clothing - none of which have anything to do with the purse/bag industry. The two biggest reasons pockets are nixed? They effect garment fit and add cost to garments.",

While there is a demographic of women that will buy pocketed clothes, most will not, as the pockets add bulk.\n\nMen on the other hand will flat out refuse pocket less clothes.\n\nSo given the sales numbers, and the cost of new production lines, most companies opt not to put pockets in women's clothing.\n\nIf women want pockets, only buy clothes with pockets and let the other clothes stagnate on the shelves.  The companies are only looking at what makes money, and pockets for women ain't it.\n\n\nEdit:  thanks for the silver stranger.  And for the gold",

Further, bridal designers have also installed pockets in their gowns, as my team and I have seen an increase in, recently. \n\nHowever, there\u2019s less of a market for larger pockets for women in other types of clothing because:\n\na: they generally carry a bag or a purse with them, negating the need for functional pockets.\n\nb: the tighter fit of women\u2019s jeans and pants cause a noticeable line that is considered undesirable.\n\nI\u2019ve closed the pocket openings and removed the internal fabric from countless pants and jeans in my time, and each time the sentiment is the same. \u201cI\u2019ll never use them, and they\u2019re useless anyway.\u201d\n\nAlso, there is an entire subtype of lingerie that give only bare coverage where needed so they can simply not show undergarment lines under their clothing - i.e. Thongs.\n\nObviously if women had larger pockets, they wouldn\u2019t feel the need to carry bags as much.

Enough to crowd out the rack space of the more practical clothing.

            "I actually did a rather long paper on this topic for university because I would go out of my way to find the oddest topics I could that I could still argue was relevant to the class just to annoy my teachers, lol. I went to school for Interdisciplinary Design, and this was a class on the history of Design.\n\nSo the origins of women's pant not having pockets goes back to the start of women being allowed to wear pants. As you could guess there was a lot of resistance against women wearing pants and originally it was only allowed in the house when she was home alone, or only her husband was present. Slowly this changed (with a lot of struggle) to women being allowed to wear pants outside of the house. Pants were made that resembled skirts, so like picture long flowy wide legs.\n\nBut there was one stipulation. They couldnt have pockets. And the reason being that if a women had pockets she could carry her own money, and be independant from her husband.\n\nWhich is actually what caused the creation of the purses, but I digress. \n\nSo this was the reason up until women started wearing jeans. Then it evolved from not being able to carry money to the women's figure being outlined. Jeans were the first pants that really showcased the curves of a womans figure. If the pockets were too big then she could put big bulky things in them and it disrupted her perfect silhouette.\n\nAnd that's still the issue. Things take a long time to change, even fashion norms.\n\nSorry for any typos, I'm on mobile and very sleepy. :P",

            "I'm late, but as a guy who wears womens' jeans, I can actually answer this question.\n\nSo you ask me why I wear them? I will tell you. 26x30 jeans are impossible to find for men. Thank God for American Eagle every so often. But I have to say, men's jeans in that size (for my size 6'1\" and 175) don't look good. \n\nWomen's jeans: The front pockets are smaller, if they're even functional. This is because they're supposed to be more form-fitting. The fly is also much shorter on many of them, Levis especially, so you have to be careful there. \n\nJeans are low, mid, and high-rise. Mid works for men. High rise jeans don't always have pockets and would look dumb with shit in the front pocket and probably be uncomfortable having a jagged item poking out, wearing out, and sticking into your belly.\n\nLow-rise jeans are too low to have a working pocket. \n\nMid-rise actually works and *could* have deeper front pockets, but not by much. Again, the shape of the hips is different, more wide than long, so the pockets need to be more proportional. \n\nThen you come to the back pockets. This is why I'm not a fan of men's jeans:\n\nMy ass looks fucking terrible in them.\n\nStraight-up, my ass looks awesome in women's jeans because the back pocket is smaller and the \"seat\" is higher. In men's jeans, there's extra material there that hangs down, which causes a loose fit and looks bad. But it also makes them harder to keep up. They want to sag there. \n\nWomen might say they want real pockets, but more importantly they want jeans that fit them properly. You can interpret that to mean \"look\", but feel and fit are important. For a woman's shape and requirements, jeans with a wider, shorter cut fit better and large pockets would look goofy or cause them to be ill-fitting.\n\nEDIT: I should add that a man's wallet won't fit in the back pocket of women's jeans.\n\nhttps://theofficialbrand.com/collections/chest-bags",

            "You probably won't be hungry or thirsty much for the last two weeks, and can expect some incontinence towards the end as well. You won't have to worry too much, eating nothing and drinking nothing will lead to less waste when that does (if it does.)\n\nSome people report an overwhelming sense of peace before the end. I hope this is true for you. I hope you have a safe passage and wonderful journey.",
            "I worked as a nurse on a oncological ward and have some experience with palliative care. \n\nDying, especially from cancer, is a process that takes time. Most of the time, you won't feel too bad. Given your medication is managed well, you shouldn't be in too much pain. \n\nMost of the patients spend their last weeks very mindful. They took their time to sort out their personal affairs, said goodbye to loved ones. \n\nThey also like to be as independently as possible, taking their time to do as much as possible themselves. \n\nFrom my experience their view towards the world shifts, they gain a whole new perspective, on a spiritual and emotional level. They live their lives until the end and make it count. Most of the patients have been extraordinarily kind and caring. \n\nOn a physical level there is if course the constant decline in abilities. You'll have to accept that at some point you'll be bed bound and rely on other people's help. \n\nThere will be issues like constipation or soreness in your mouth, fatigue. You'll spend a lot of your time sleeping and little tasks will be very exhausting for you. You won't have much appetite.\n\nWhen it comes to dying itself, you won't have to worry. Your body knows what to do. It is a process that can take days, you'll just be asleep for a long time, you don't want to eat or drink anymore, you don't want to have a lot of interaction with other people anymore. \n\nSome people get very anxious, but as for the pain, there are meds that can ease that anxiety and help you relax. A palliative nurse will notice your anxiety even if you aren't able to tell her anymore, as you can tell from the body movements, and give you medication to help you. \n\nBefore you actually die, you won't be in a conscious state anymore. It will feel more like a deep sleep. You won't be awake and telling people goodbye, as in the movies. \n\nI am very sorry for what you are facing. \nI know you don't want anything sugar coated, I just tell you the truth as I know it. \n\nIt won't be that bad for yourself, you will be able to manage. And in the end you have no more strength left and you will just accept and even welcome the fact that it's now over. It's going to be bad for your loved ones, but that's why you will say goodbye to them in the weeks to come.",
            "In cases like yours, it's the doctor's job to make sure you're comfortable and in as little pain as possible when you pass. As your body weakens, you'll likely lose consciousness first. At this point, the doctors will be able to see you slipping as your vital signs weaken. It's possible that you'll pass very quickly after you lose consciousness. If it looks like it's going to take a while, the doctors will administer painkillers and tranquilizers. The painkillers will help make sure you aren't in pain, and the tranquilizers will help you to go peacefully, hopefully avoiding seizures as your nervous system shuts down.\n\nOnce you lose consciousness, it's unlikely that you'll be aware of the world around you. You might dream, you might not. The important thing is that you shouldn't feel any pain, and with the doctor's aid you should be able to just peacefully slip away.\n\nOne final note, when people are very near death, they often seem to know its coming. And from what I've gathered from my family members in the medical field, it will be easiest not to fight it when the time comes, just let it take you. \n\nYou seem to be facing this bravely, which is very admirable. God bless.",
            "When I was 16 I overdosed, my heart stopped and I died. I knew it was going to happen moments before it did.  I felt it beating out of control and I was laying in my own vomit. I was the most horrified I had ever been because I knew I was about to die. When my heart stopped I was the most peaceful I had ever been, I forgot how horrible I just felt laying in my own vomit and feeling my heart go insane. It brought me comfort knowing that when my final day comes again, and I\u2019m not able to be revived, I can feel that peace again. I\u2019m 24 years old and still don\u2019t know what to make of the situation.",
            "Eventually, you'll lose consciousness. I took care of my grandma while she was dying from stomach cancer and she became kind of lifeless. My father and I were with her when she passed. My father told her, \"Ma, it's time to go.\" At that moment she let go. BTW that bullshit when they close dead people's eyelids when they die on TV or the movies doesn't work.\n\nEdit: I'm sorry you're at this point and I hope you have people that love you as much as I did my grandma",
            "I was seconds from drowning a few years back. Whitewater kayaking with the wrong gear in icy water when you're not a strong swimmer will do that.\n\nDeath itself, I can't tell you, as I survived to type this. However, if it's at all helpful, I wasn't afraid. I was a bit frustrated at being dragged along the bottom of the river unable to get to the surface, but not long after, the little bit of panic subsided & I became quite calm. I briefly worried for my children, then remembered I have a lot of life insurance & the rest of the family would see to their well being. My life didn't flash before my eyes, per se, but the thoughts I did have were rapid fire.\n\nI accepted my fate, relaxed, & let go. I was running out of oxygen. I closed my eyes & could feel my life starting to fade. For the first time in many years, I was at peace.\n\nThen the current shifted, shot me back to the surface, & once I was getting air again, my survival instinct kicked back in. But before that, I was at peace. It felt like allowing myself to fall asleep, more than anything. The lead up when I knew I was in danger but thought I could survive was scary as hell. When I was certain I wouldn't, it was relaxing & peaceful. No doubt, that was the result of oxygen deprivation. Given it's your lungs that are failing you, you'll likely experience similar oxygen deprivation, then you'll just drift away.\n\nDeath is terrifying for everyone, I'm sure, but nearly losing my life due to a lack of oxygen was painless & oddly comfortable. I can only hope that when your time comes, you feel the same comfort I felt when you realize it's over.\n\nI wish I could say more, or something better. But nobody truly knows what death is like. Even those of us who've knocked on death's door probably don't really know. But, of all the ways my life has nearly ended (I've had many close calls), that was perhaps the best way to go.\n\nI hope that helps give you some kind of comfort or acceptance. Given I don't have a psych degree, I'm not sure what else I can do for you, but I hope this gives you something.\n\nEdit: This got far more attention than I intended. I may not be able to answer everyone's questions, as this was never meant to be about me. It was the only way I knew of to help OP understand what may be coming. I hope some others with similar yet different experiences can share to give OP some peace of mind. I doubt any of us can make the terminal nature of OP's illness better for them, but hopefully we can bring some kind of comfort to them.",
            "Physical decline? As things progress, you\u2019ll have periods of increased somnolence. Some days you\u2019ll have the energy to chat and eat and drink and other days you\u2019ll be so exhausted you can\u2019t think of anything else but sleep. Palliative medications can help with comfort. Hydromorphone or Morphine will likely be discussed for symptom management. \n\u201cExperts\u201d say hearing is the last sense to go so I always tell my palliative patients families to always talk to their loved ones. As they go deeper into sedation, sometimes people need to hear \u201cit\u2019s okay to go\u201d some patients need to hear that reassurance that everyone one around them will be okay without them. Keeping palliative patients comfortable is always the goal. However, some patients can experience hypo or hyper delirium and that can be hard to control sometimes. But as long as you have competent doctors and nurses, you should kept as comfortable as possible for a gentle approach to end of life.",
            "My sister died from cancer almost 3 years ago. I was with her the night she died. She hadn't received any treatment and wasn't in a hospital when it happened, so no morphine or anything to help with the pain. It was stage 4 breast cancer that had moved into her lymph nodes, spine, and lungs. At the beginning of the night, she was speaking and making jokes, albeit slowly and with labored breath, but as the night progressed, she started to deteriorate quickly. She wanted a bath, and her friend brought her to the tub. She was vomiting and in a lot of pain, but then her mind took over. She told me that she was inside a rose, and it was soft and lovely. A peach rose. The hallucination made her feel better and I imagine helped with the pain. We got her back into bed, and she came back to us for a little bit, but then the oxygen deprivation won. She started gasping for air and making these sounds I can't properly describe. By that time, the ambulance had arrived, she was taken to the hospital, where she was only kept alive by them manually pumping her lungs. So we let her go. \n\nI'm sorry I don't have the most comforting story for you, and I'm sorry if this doesn't actually answer your question. And I truly hope you'll be more comfortable than she was.",
            "I watched a family member die in a hospital bed and, if I'm meant to be honest, she seemed very peaceful at that time. She knew death was coming for her and accepted it. I can't personally say what she felt then, but when her time came she was smiling to us, so i assume she passed peacefully and happy we were there for her. Anyways, I hope you a painless passing surrounded by those you love and trust, friend. May the afterlife take good care of you.",

            "I don't know if this will help or not. I copied this from a Hospice site. Dying is different for everyone, just like sickness is different from everyone. Nobody really knows what dying feels like because the person is shutting down and can't really describe what they are feeling. Pain can be helped with pain medication to keep a person comfortable. I think the final days/hours a person falls into a coma because their brain and organs are shutting down and you drift away in your sleep. \n\nThe following describes the physical symptoms people have observed a dying person to have. Here are end-of-life signs and helpful tips:\r  \n\r  \n**Coolness**. Hands, arms, feet, and legs may be increasingly cool to the touch. The color of the skin may change and become mottled.\n\n\r  \n**Confusion**. The patient may not know time or place and may not be able to identify people around them. \n\n\r  \n**Sleeping.** An increasing amount of time may be spent sleeping. The person may become unresponsive, uncommunicative, and difficult to arouse. How you can help: Sleeping more frequently is normal. You can sit quietly with them. Speak in a normal voice. Hold their hand. Assume they can hear everything you say. They probably can.\r  \nIncontinence. They may lose control of urinary/bowel functions. This is a common end-of-life change that can occur during the process of passing on. \n\n\r  \n**Restlessness**. The person may make repetitive motions such as pulling at the bed linen or clothing. This is due in part to A decrease in oxygen. \n\n\r  \n**Congestion.** There may be gurgling sounds inside the chest. This is also sometimes referred to as a \"Death Rattle.\" These may be loud. This end-of-life symptom does not indicate the onset of severe pain.\n\n\r  \n**Urine decrease**. Output may decrease and become tea colored. \n\n\r  \n**Fluid and food decrease.** Your loved one may want little or no food or fluid. The body will naturally conserve energy required for the task ahead. Food is no longer needed. \n\n\r  \n**Change in breathing.** The person may take shallow breaths with periods of no breathing for a few seconds to a minute. They may experience periods of rapid, shallow panting. These patterns are common and indicate decrease in circulation.\n\n\r  \n**Fever.** Increase in temperature is common.",
            "I am a junior doctor working in palliative care, and I have seen more people die in the last few months than I probably would in my entire career. Ultimately, palliative care is all about providing patients with a 'good death' and it means different things for different people. Most patients with us have metastatic cancers. Less common would be end stage COPD and strokes. It's best to speak to your oncologist but hopefully I can help.\n\nDeath is both different and similar for everybody. I'll explain. We often talk about the Karnofsky  and the PACA scores for each patient on the ward round. Both of these tend to indicate what the general condition is. The Karnofsky in particular can give you an idea of how the body declines physically. Below are the links:\n\nhttps://www.mdcalc.com/karnofsky-performance-status-scale\n\nhttps://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.nwcscnsenate.nhs.uk/files/2714/3394/6192/Fatigue.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjOqo3n6onxAhUM4OAKHYnhDvsQFjAEegQIGRAC&usg=AOvVaw2isXlXKJGTlB48B40Lqghc&cshid=1623217323883\n\n\nPatient's symptoms differ depending on their cancer and where it has spread. If it is in the bones, you tend to get bone pain. Each type of pain has different characteristics and it is difficult to describe. However, if the bone is 'weak' you can get pathological fractures which can cause spikes in pain as you can imagine. If the tumor/swelling from the cancer/bone impinge on nerves, you may get sensation changes +/- weakness +/- neuropathic pain.\n\nHowever, these can be managed with medications which reduce swelling, strengthen bones, and proper analgesia. The silver lining is that as your body deteriorations, you will feel less and less of these symptoms. All patients, who are slowly deteriorating, reach a point where all active treatment is stopped and focus is put on anticipatory medications. These are the ones that keep a person comfortable in the terminal stages, and tend to deal with pain, anxiety, seizures, secretions, nausea, vomiting, mouth care, etc. They work very well! \n\nThe terminal phase of the deterioration or dying, is where things tend to be similar. If the symptoms are well managed, people become weaker and weaker. They will sleep more and more through the day, sometimes the whole of 24hrs. They will likely lose all appetite, and stop eating and drinking. They will likely become unconscious. Their breathing becomes erratic and noisy, which may be distressing to people around you but the person is usually not registering it by that point. But usually, these are not uncomfortable for the patient, and tend to pass away very peacefully. This is a very much a summarised version of what happens.\n\nDeath, if well managed, is a very peaceful process.\n\nWhat you should focus on now is making plans. Whenever we clerk our patients in, we discuss with them about their medical bits, but also about their spirituality, religion, family dynamics, preferred place of care and death (home, hospice, etc), who is important to them, who we should keep in the loop, organ donation, genetic sampling, and what their goals and expectations are, among other things. \n\nIf you'd like, these can all be worked into an \"Emergency health care plan (EHCP)\" or an \"Advanced directive\". You can also think about \"Lasting power of attorney\" (appointing someone who can legally make decisions on your behalf). A \"DNAR (do not attempt resus)\" is also important, this one is put in place by a doctor, hopefully, after a discussion with you. \n\nThis is probably too much information to take in right now. Sorry. \n\nSpend some quality time with the people you care about. I am really sorry about what you're going through, and I wish you all the best.\n\nFeel free to ask anything.",

            "Unfortunately very few people have been revived after death and actually remember it.  My guess is it's different for everyone. The most common thing I have heard is as your brain starts to shut down you see flashes of a bright light. Some people say they see their life flash before their eyes. They see all the good times they had.   Several people have said they saw loved ones that have died standing there waiting for them.  I'm sorry that you are going through this. It's not fair at all. All I can say is make the time you have left the best days ever. Maybe try things that you were too afraid to try. I know I would go sky diving or maybe try magic mushrooms or acid just to get the experience.  \n\nPeople who fear death aren't really afraid of the dying part it's the fear of the unknown. We all have to go through it. I like to think that my loved ones who have died will be there with me. My dad and I like paranormal things like ghost. We promised each other that one dies before the other the one that does will do everything they can to let the other know if the afterlife is real.   We will have to see what happen.

            "3 perspectives. Myself... nearly drowning in lifeguard training due to someone else accidentally damaging me during a drill. The pain I should have felt in my lungs slowed down. Felt frustration, but just sorta gave up. While this was done in 5 minutes or less before waking up (wasn't passed out, but sorta... came to) on the side of the pool like nothing happened.   \n\n\nMy grandmother. Her systems just... shut down (old age). For about two weeks she was just... laying in her bed. No IV's, or anything, but not really eating or moving. Slowly speaking. Dazed. She did not seem to be in pain, but sorta... half asleep and awake all the time. She passed while I was in the room and I didn't even really know until the machines told me. Although she wasn't senile, her last days seemed like she didn't want to wake from a really intense nap. \n\nMy friend Ashley (not her real name). Cancer at 23. Dead at 25. She was... unrecognizable. Swollen, changed. All the IV's and machines hooked up. She was comatose for months. The hospital made no secret of the fact that they were keeping her alive to study the final stages of her specific cancer. She was unresponsive, but her family decided to keep her alive (barely) so progress could be made in research. Nobody knows what she felt during this time. CAT scans and brain function suggested she felt nothing and was functionally dead before her body gave out weeks later. But we don't know. When she was conscious and talking she would not speak of pain, just fatigue and frustration and confusion. The decision to allow herself to be kept 'alive' after hope was going was partially hers.   \n\n\nMake your wishes known.. ahead of time. If you are confused or frustrated and strange people are smiling at you, take it at face value, at people trying to help, people desperate to help and who care more than maybe you'll remember at the time.",

If something can make you more comfortable - communicate it.\n\nStoic compliance tends to be instilled in us early on and by 21 you may not have come to shed that much.\n\nThis is the end of *your* life.

            "No one can tell you truly how dying feels. But, my dad just got his wings and I was there the night before. He had a rare muscular wasting disease and became weaker as time progressed. His mind was fine, but he was trapped in his body. \n\nHe was tired and dosed a great deal. I remember him telling me all of my life when I was tired. \"Gnat, you'll sleep when you're dead. Let's keep going.\" He did that until his wings arrived. When he woke up, he talked. If you have things to say, stay up. Docs will keep you comfortable.\n\nThe toughest part for him was being physically changed. He was a 30-yr USN veteran. This was not how he wanted to end.  I wiped him  clean for the last time. Be prepared to depend on people for your basic needs. \n\nAlso, voice how much of an intervention that you wish. We placed a PEG tube to help my dad  keep his nutrition up. I asked for this because I didn't realize that he wouldn't  come back from not being able to eat. I was sitting by his bed one day and in his sleep, he motioned as though he was picking up food and eating. Broke my heart. Be kind, voice your wishes.\n\nYou will be kept comfortable, but will get tired.  Do not be afraid to ask for what you need. This is all about you. Voice your needs. I kept a close watch on this. \n\nMuch love to you, little one. I'm sorry that your  journey will end much too soon.",

            "Organs failing, slowly feeling yourself lose strength and all that other fun stuff doesn\u2019t feel good that\u2019s for sure. It\u2019s kinda of like when your in a dream and trying to run and you just don\u2019t seem to move. I\u2019d imagine that is what it feels like to be dying. \n\nLosing autonomy and all that jazz is gonna suck. With your case your gonna feel stiffness and swelling in your lungs, across your chest etc. it\u2019s going to hurt to move, walk and even breathe. A lump near the surface of the skin is common, a fever that doesn\u2019t break and broken bones caused by tumours growing is part of the parcel that is Ewing\u2019s. \n\nBut all of this knowledge is just a stone throws away if you used google so I\u2019m guessing you must want something else. \n\nDeath is death. It\u2019s something that it doesn\u2019t matter how much money you have or how much fame it will eventually come for you. People always think of death as some evil figure but I like to think that death is more of a deity which wants you to live and wants you to power through all that life throws at you because it knows that it is inevitable and you will meet it at the end of the story. \n\nMany people claim that when death catches up to you, one may see there god or something magical happens and there transported to another world to be it\u2019s hero and that might all be possible. It also might be possible nothing happens and it all fades to black. In both cases this is a good thing. The former means you move onto another form of life and living while the latter means an end to your suffering. Death is moving on from this plain of existence and I\u2019m not being religious or super scientific about it. It is really just moving on.\n\nEverything you\u2019re going through is daunting and reaching out to the people around you may seem harrowing but when your living day by day not knowing when the end is just make those final human connections to carry you into the next phase because that may be all you take with you. Try not to go into the light with any regrets weighing you down. Talk to friends and family and anyone that brings you happiness. The ones you leave behind will also feel affected by your passing. Let them remember someone inspiring that brings joy and meaning to there life. My grandfather always said he never wanted anyone to feel pity for him and I\u2019m sure you feel the same.\n\nStay strong. And if you do meet our maker tell him he or she or it owes me a lot.",

Death is also as natural to your existence as birth, it\u2019s the path paved by every person, plant or animal that has ever existed. \n\nAs for the actual process, well, I have watched a few people die. My father had brain cancer and he went into a coma a few days before he passed. This is common for cancer patients, and you will be well medicated. Just before he passed, he opened his eyes and despite his family being in the room, he looked to an empty corner, smiled and took a final breath. I don\u2019t know what that means, we speculated that it may have been someone we lost earlier to show him the way. I don\u2019t know, but I think it\u2019s a part of the reason I don\u2019t fear death. Whatever it was, he was happy to see it. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry again that this is happening to you. From the bottom of my heart and soul, FUCK cancer.",
            "The answer to this question can largely depend on the kind of treatment you opt for - ICU and full code vs. palliation at home are entirely different things - different pain, levels of awareness, medications, interventions, yadda yadda. I hope there is a palliative team consulted for you already. If there isn\u2019t, please ask for one. Any doctor you see should be able to discuss death, but the palliative care folks often have more time to talk/experience with death, which translates to attentive and compassionate care. Never be afraid to ask for a second opinion. Ask lots of questions. Ask about intubation and resuscitation. You only die once. Do it the way you like. If you haven\u2019t yet, then whenever you are ready, ask your medical team to go through appropriate documentation with you in order to clarify your wishes. You are the driver, and everyone else is along for the ride. \nI cannot get in my patients\u2019 heads, but I will say that it can be very frustrating to see patients eternally left on the vent because their family is (understandably) experiencing guilt about discontinuing care, despite no hope of improvement. Sometimes less care is more, even though goodbyes may arrive rudely before we are prepared for them. Fortunately, we now have many helpful continuous medications to remove feelings of panic, and to ease you into a sleep. Dying in our era can be much kinder than in many eras preceding ours. I\u2019m so horribly sorry that your goodbyes are not coming on the schedule you expected, and I\u2019m sorry that is out of your control. I hope you find some comfort in the things that are still very much so in your control.\nEdit: specifically, opioids can assuage air hunger.",

            "It\u2019s odd, because I have always been terrified of my own death, but when I was dying, it wasn\u2019t nearly as bad as I thought.\n\nI have nearly died on a few occasions. Just unlucky I guess. Once, when I was a child, I was nearly drowned when an older kid decided to hold me underwater. When I was a young teen, I developed a severe lung infection and had to be kept on several antibiotics to stay stable. And most recently, I had my heart stop and restart before the age of 20. (A genetic arrhythmia previously unbeknownst to me, exacerbated by a medication I was already on).\n\nIn every situation, I was scared at first. When I thought I was going to die, I would fight and fight. But my energy would decrease. My heart would struggle to keep going. That\u2019s the one thing I\u2019d say is unusual when you know you are about to die- I was so keenly aware of my heart that I felt it everywhere in my body. I grew tired of fighting though. In every situation, I just kind of... gave up. I was done. My body was done. I didn\u2019t have the will to fight what was happening to me anymore, which made me unbearably sad for a few seconds. I was sad that I was giving up, and a little angry, but then I was at peace. I thought about everything in life that had made me happy. \nI thought about people I loved, and how lucky I was to meet them. I thought about my dog and my partner. I even thought about my coworkers. I decided I was ok with dying, and let go. From there on out, I just felt patient and tired. I had all the time in the world to wait to die, and it would happen when it happened. I closed my eyes and waited to go. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to say to you. I have been dying, but never dead. And while my time is borrowed to a certain extent, my circumstances are not like yours. Physically, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re going to get a lot of really smart and thoughtful responses on here. Emotionally, I can only tell you what I experienced. I went through the fearful, fighting stage, realized I was going to die; sadness and anger for a few seconds and then a peaceful release and patient wait for death. When I was closest to death, I mostly felt tired, patient, and calm. I was ready to go.\n\nI hope that we\u2019ve helped you get ready as best we can.",

            "I used to work in homecare, so I've seen a lot of people in the last periods and moments of their lives. Of course I can't say anything definite... But there are some general features, sometimes the stages are skipped and sometimes they last for longer periods...\n\nIf you worry about pain or torment - don't worry, the doctors and nurses will make sure you're doing okay in that period. As you close to the end, it seems that there's a certain serenity and clarity, general acceptance and openness towards death. It might be not eating and drinking for a while.\n\nNow, for the last few days, you might end up in a kind of vegetative state, in which your only function remaining is breathing. I suspect this isn't bad, some people wake up briefly from this phase and are even able to talk. They don't seem concerned, anxious or anything - I suspect that means, that their gasping period didn't negatively affect them. If you go through this, you'll soon return to the gasping stage and probably your body shuts down soon after that.\n\nI have seen a lot of death and I don't think the act of dying itself is bad. It's the lost time, the things you could have done, the things you could have said. I don't think they are important - I think what is important, is that you accept yourself and rid yourself of as much negativity as possible towards the end. Enjoy what you have and keep your mind off what you could have had, enjoy what you can, don't dwelve on what you ought to.\n\nFrom what I've seen, dying isn't awful for the one doing it. It is for your next of kin and close relatives. It's not pretty, but the hygienic stuff is handled by others who don't mind - so don't mind that yourself. Make sure you tell the people what you want to happen after death - they will remember you and feel good fulfilling your wishes. If you don't care or have wishes, make some up and enjoy knowing you'll be giving your family and friends comfort. If there's one thing I've found bringing joy, it's the relatives knowing what the dead wanted - not outrageous stuff, just things like clothes, flowers etc.",

You need to get a lawyer or legal aid assistant and assign someone you trust with Medical power of Attorney. Tell them you want to die simply, no extreme measures like intubation and to save you from potential fights in the family when your time comes. They may get scared, some asshat doctor may decide that he/she knows better. With power of attorney on your side it should go easy, but pick a friend who is tough or enough of a bitch that they will push back and make sure you get what you want. If you don't have this yet, start tomorrow. Depending on your State of residence it can take weeks or more.\n\nIf you can read, get some books on Near Death Experiences. PMH Atwater has some good ones, Life after Life was the first book in the field and is still good. Have a friend read them or get them on tape. Do Not get some sappy \"I met Jesus\" propaganda as there is a lot of it out there. You want well researched books with interviews with dozens of different people.\n\nAs you said death is easy. Read those books and you will see that you will have access to Divine understanding and the reason for your seemingly short time in this birth will quickly become obvious. \n\nTake care of business here and be prepared for a pleasant surprise when you leave.\n\nEdit: By the way, if anyone knows a competent, considerate Pain Specialist in the SF Bay Area, please PM me.",

That part can\u2019t be confirmed though, so let people know to still talk to you, read to you, play you music, etc. as hearing is one of the last things to go. \nYou\u2019ll eventually lose control of your bowels, but hopefully at that point you won\u2019t be aware. You may want to have your family prepare for what\u2019s to come (if they will be taking care of you). It was an experience I wasn\u2019t prepared for (not that you can be), but I did my research so it wasn\u2019t as traumatizing when new symptoms arose. \n\nMy only advice...enjoy the time you have, make peace with anything you might be holding on to, and let your family and friends help. You may find peace, you may get scared, you may have both...and all of that is ok. \n\nMaybe leave your family with something they can hold on to, such as a video of you, or a diary. I have saved voicemails and my grandmas diary, and despite the pain, it makes me really happy to read it. It brings her back to life in my eyes, even if only temporarily.\n\nBest wishes and hopes for a peaceful life transition, my friend. If you need anyone to talk to or have more questions, I\u2019d be happy to answer. Having just gone through this for the first time, I\u2019d love to offer advice or education so you or your family maybe don\u2019t have to worry and stress about every little thing like I did",

            "Lots of people saying to take pain medication but it\u2019s more important to have your caretaker know you want medication. You won\u2019t be able to communicate at the end. I do believe pain medication is also used as calming medication. Not that dying is painful so much as potentially frightening. \n\nFor the decline, your body will become slower and harder to use. Your functions will be harder to manage. You\u2019ll be sleepier and less inclined to participate. Food isn\u2019t important. \n\nRemember this, whatever your path, it is YOUR path. It doesn\u2019t need to be what you expect or assume, it needs to be whatever it will become. Some people stay around for 3 weeks or more in a seemingly comatose state. Others hit the end and go quickly. It\u2019s not a matter of willpower or effort. It doesn\u2019t matter how bad you want to stay or go. It\u2019s not up to you at that point. Medication can make side effects worse or easier. Hindsight is all that really counts. \n\nI\u2019d have a serious conversation with yourself about how much intervention you want and when. Do you want to pass in a hospital? Do you want to be at home? Both will have plus and minus. Do you want friends around or doctors. Do you want extreme intervention or to go naturally. Make plans as if your in a coma. Let those in charge make your choices that you\u2019ve already decided. It helps you know that you\u2019ll be comfortable and it will help those behind know these are the plans you want. Making decisions at the end is excruciating. I only ever wanted to do what he wanted and I\u2019m so grateful he left the way he had always planned. \n\nDying is only about YOU. This is your singular experience that everyone around supports you. But use this awareness of your coming experience to decide how you want it to look.",
            "First off, I just wanted to say as a fellow human and Redditor, I\u2019m sorry, this sucks, and we love you.\n\nYou say you\u2019re on borrowed time (I suppose we all are) so I\u2019ll put the TLDR here:\n\nTLDR: I\u2019ve watched my mom and grandmother die to lung cancer, my aunt also died from lung cancer but I wasn\u2019t there at the very end. Each of them went to sleep during what hospice workers call \u201cactive dying\u201d which was explained like a system shutdown process. I\u2019m not sure about your pain levels but it seems your body/brain gives you a little break from the pain. You likely won\u2019t wake up for the last hours, but if you do wake up, don\u2019t hesitate to say whatever you want to or need to say. You will then fade slowly out. I will put more advice at the end if you want to skip down.\n\nI feel like I\u2019m somewhat qualified to answer this as I\u2019ve lost 3 people to lung cancers since 2016, my mom, nanny (aunt), and granny (grandmother). My mother and grandmother didn\u2019t have Ewing\u2019s sarcoma and we didn\u2019t have time to determine specifics about my aunt as she went too quickly, but since all three had cancers that stemmed from the lungs I would assume it\u2019s similar. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve also been in touch with hospice workers so I won\u2019t bother you with the stuff they surely told you (although if you haven\u2019t, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU DO!) \n\nMom\u2019s metastasized to her bones so she was in a lot of pain, and medicated accordingly. She had a pretty \u201cgreat\u201d last day, fried shrimp lunch, then she went to sleep and didn\u2019t wake up for hours. We didn\u2019t think she would, but she did long enough to say she felt alright (miraculous considering her usual pain level) and that she loved us. She had short breaths but it seemed like her body knew what was happening and naturally gave her relief from the pain. She went back to sleep after being a little confused (probably because her body wasn\u2019t filtering the morphine or fentanyl anymore so she was probably just super high). She never woke up again but according to the hospice worker (see: angel) \u201cactive dying\u201d isn\u2019t quite sleep, and mom would squeeze our hands a little and no longer had the permanent grimace of pain on her face that she usually had, even while sleeping. \n\nNanny\u2019s cancer was fast and vicious, what seemed like bronchitis the first month took her in 3. Her last few months were tough, I was living much further at the time so I wasn\u2019t there at the very end but for two months she was soiling herself, not eating, in incredible pain, and sleeping at least 20 hours a day. That said, according to my granny the last two days Nanny seemed to be feeling much better, and was much clearer when she woke up, then she too went into \u201cactive dying\u201d which appears to others like a peaceful sleep, and her breaths grew shallower and shallower (but not labored or gasping) until she faded out.\n\nFinally my Granny, who passed January of last year. My Gram was awesome, I lived with her as we took care of my mom and I had moved much closer by this time so I split my time between Texas and Louisiana taking care of her. She was much older so near the end I was helping her get out of bed to use the restroom and get dressed and stuff but she was always coherent and fortunately still very independent. I\u2019m an early 30\u2019s man and she was a late 70\u2019s woman, so I know you might be thinking that if I had to hold her over the toilet that\u2019s not very \u201cindependent\u201d but she was wiping, brushing her teeth, and all the other things we take for granted, just not the \u201cstrong\u201d stuff like getting up or squatting. (Sorry if this is TMI, but if I\u2019m going to answer your question I\u2019m not going to beat around the bush.) She never ate much before the cancer but during she had even less of an appetite so that was an issue but otherwise she was just a sick old lady and she too passed in her sleep. No gasping or struggling, just a nap, I was with her the entire time.\n\nI cannot promise this will be your experience but with each of them, their bodies gave up slowly and softly. Systems shut down but without added pain. They appeared to be sleeping peacefully as their breaths grew more and more relaxed until their hearts finally stopped. \n\nCancer is a rat bastard that\u2019ll take everything it can, but in my experience with lung cancers, once it\u2019s taken everything it can, it leaves you with some dignity and peace for your final moments\u2026 and that\u2019s all any of us can ask for. \n\nAdvice: \n\n1. Bank accounts and other \u201cgrown up\u201d business is tough to deal with for those you leave behind. Do all you can to wrap up loose ends because 6-7 months from now, your loved ones will likely still be picking up the emotional pieces, they don\u2019t need headaches with death certificates and bank accounts and possessions. Trust me, with COVID, my Granny\u2019s meager estate literally just dissolved last month. \n\n2. Eat\u2026 you likely already don\u2019t want to, aren\u2019t hungry I understand. But even a few slices of bread or something you love will give you more energy and clarity. The clarity is most important because even without the drugs you most certainly are on, your mind will start to fog up and you will get confused and possibly scared\u2026 eat, please, anything you can. There are medications for nausea and appetite, take them if you need.\n\n3. Say your goodbyes, share your love, and favorite memories. Give gifts, tell jerks to fuck off, do whatever you want\u2026 \n\nthen do drugs\u2026 \n\ndon\u2019t overdose because you don\u2019t want to be throwing up or convulsing as you go, but take an extra painkiller, use some extra pot (if you don\u2019t have a prescription, get some, it will help with almost everything including appetite and nausea). Side note: if you\u2019re having difficulties using the restroom at all, don\u2019t be afraid of catheters and diapers, I know it\u2019s not great but the alternative is worse, plus who doesn\u2019t want to piss the bed but remain dry and not smell like piss?\n\n4. Be clear in your instructions. If you want to die in your bed, tell people that, because people who have no experience with this kind of thing will default to \u201ccall 911/hospice and bring them to a hospital.\u201d I\u2019m sure you hate hospitals by now, so if you don\u2019t want to go, tell people that. \n\n5. I don\u2019t care if you come from a family of oncologists and nurses. I don\u2019t care if everyone around you has been through this a million times. I cannot recommend hospice enough if you don\u2019t already have a hospice service set up. They can get you medications at pretty much any time. They can be there at the end times, and usually they will be there for your family/friends afterwards. They have counseling services for you now, and your people afterwards. Hospice workers are amazing. End of story.\n\nI meant to type a paragraph but apparently this issue is pretty close to my heart so now you are too. Take pride in the fact that a global pandemic didn\u2019t end you, the only thing that could was your own body\u2026 and that\u2019s kinda badass. Be well, eat, and rest.",
            "Before people pass, they sometimes get what hospice people call a \u201crally \u201c. They will suddenly seem to recover, become talkative and sometimes alert. It lasts about 24 hours. Then their body starts to shut down. They may hallucinate \u2014see and talk to people from their past. Eventually the organs start to shut down.  Family members sometimes request the morphine and Ativan so they will pass without pain or fear. Been through this with various family members.

It was so powerful to listen to, and these women will just know when someone is about to pass. And they are so caring. They are the ushers who help patients pass from this existence, while helping the family process everything and feel useful when there's nothing left to do but wait.\n\nSorry about that tangent, it might be something you'll experience at the end, and I just found it fascinating.

            "My late fiance had cholangiocarcinoma at age 22. He had extreme pain at first because he wasn't consistently taking pain medication. Once he was on a drip things evened out quite a bit. He began sleeping more and more. His ears got wax impacted so we had them cleaned out. He started to be incontinent, which was difficult for me only because he was visibly embarrassed and I just wanted him to know how much it was MY PRIVILEGE to take care of the man I loved with all my heart. He had mood swings during pain crisis, understandably. He stopped eating and drinking shortly after the incontinence set in. Then he stopped talking. His eyes developed a thick mucous like film over them and they no longer shut completely when he slept. One day he was suddenly awake and even had the strength to get up and go to the living room to watch TV. He laughed one last time at a dirty joke his older brother told him. We put him back to bed and I asked if he wanted to watch TV. He said yes but let's lay together first. He had been highly claustrophobic up until that point. It was then that I knew he would be gone very soon. Our last lucid memory was holding each other in silence. It is possibly the most intimate experience of my life. He no longer required haloperidol or extra pain medication as he no longer felt any pain. A day later his nephew was born. His very last words were in response to seeing a video of his nephew crying. He said \"he's beautiful\". He passed away the next day at 432pm.",

We never stop for a second and realistically think about this question that OP asked. And the things we will experience that several commentors said may really happen to the most of us. I think we're all together in this, and yet we have to do it alone, all by ourselves, just at different times.So a group hug to everyone here now and another when I met you there, wherever that is.

            "My sister just passed from Ewings Sarcoma in April. You may have known or seen her mentioned on various support boards. \n\nShe was diagnosed in 2017 at 26 and passed away at 30. As many others noted in the chat in their experiences with loved ones, she was on heavy morphine and opiates at the end because the pain was unbearable otherwise. There were moments she'd wake up and not know who she was or what was happening. We'd have to explain who she was, who we were, and that she was dying. It was incredibly hard. Her lungs were filling with fluid from the cancer so she was on heavy ventilation. It was hard for her to stay lucid and harder to talk. She passed in her sleep when she simply stopped breathing. \n\nBut in between the moments of death, there was life.

            "Ok so I\u2019m not going to sugar coat (like you asked) my mom of 44 was diagnosed with stage 4 lung and brain cancer in august of \u201815. She was put in chemotherapy within the month and lasted about 4 treatments before stopping. She explained that it turned her into a miserable bed ridden zombie and wanted to spend her last months as close to her normal self as possible. It is going to be physically painful as you get closer to the end. The one thing she explained was to give in and embrace the circumstance and to not dwell on what is inevitable. She was a roller coaster of euphoric to screaming in pain by the day. In the last weeks she ended up talking about life and her experiences, including some funny secrets she wouldn\u2019t normally share, which might be good for you, ya know opening up without the need to feel self conscious or judged. In the very end she had turned into someone I couldn\u2019t recognize and that was the hardest part as someone experiencing it second hand let alone as her son. There is a possibility you will forget peoples name yet still know who they are. She ended up being Suppressed  with morphine and put under so she didn\u2019t feel any pain and could go as peacefully as possible. I think the biggest advice I could give you is to be yourself as best as you can, experience what you can, and to try your best to not dwell on the bad. It helped her so I believe it can help you. With everything I have I truly hope you find peace and can take something from my moms experience to help you on this journey.
