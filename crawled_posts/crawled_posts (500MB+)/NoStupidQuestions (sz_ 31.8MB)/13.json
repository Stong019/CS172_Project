You will likely have buildup then that can\u2019t be removed by a couple weeks of flossing. \n\nWe aren\u2019t judging you. Actually, some hygienists I know will roll their eyes at nice clean teeth and will fight for the patient with heavy buildup. There\u2019s something so satisfying about removing calculus. Mmmm. \n\nYou\u2019ve just got to remember that mouth stuff is ALL WE DO ALL DAY ERR DAY. Save the teeth embarrassment for your Mechanic or something. Not the dentist.",

            "Totally depends on the person. Some people are more susceptible to tooth and gum damage than others.\n\nHonestly, dentists don't care. The whole purpose of their job is to clean your teeth because you can't. Your teeth are strong enough that if you take regular care of them and don't eat stuff that eats away at them, you can go your entire life without a visit to the dentist. Since most people don't do that, dentists exist, and they're happy to help.",

I have bad teeth and am not good at taking care of them. I\u2019m better than I used to be but not perfect. Having a dentist who I felt comfortable with and who I didn\u2019t feel judged by helped me improve my oral care a lot and made it so I made regular dentist appointments for the first time in my life.",
            "All these people telling you that after about a week or two the bleeding should stop is bullshit. I was a regular flosser for a year straight, I had my gums so fucking built up that there was no bleeding so I was prepared when I went to the dentist to get praise. \n\nSee the thing is, I used regular, waxed floss. When MY hygienist goes to floss my teeth at the next visit, she pulls out this fucking double stranded, death machine floss. You know that shit, the floss that has fluoride string spidered along it? It's like double the gauge and 100x more abrasive. \n\nShe begins to saw away at my teeth with this assassin's strangulation cable and my teeth start bleeding naturally. \n\n\"There's a lot of bleeding here... Do you floss at all?\"  she asks. \n\nI wanted to kill her. Good thing I had floss nearby.",

It doesn't hurt and there's no bleeding.\n\nEvery time I get a checkup, the hygienist asks if I floss, then says I'm doing it wrong, and demonstrates how to do it.  I've been going to the same dentist/hygienist for over 10 years, by the way.\n\nSo here's the deal: just do it and don't worry about what they say too much.",

Then he started going and the dentist said he had perfect teeth. I don't think I've ever seen him floss.\n\nI go to the dentist every 6 months, and have at least 2 cavities. \n\nGo figure.",
            "I am not 100% sure but something I picked up from my dental hygienist is first to floss, then use a disinfectant mouthwash (like Listerine) then brush and then rinse with a whitening fluoride rinse.

            "Actual wage is less relevant than cost of living.  A lot of the bigger cities in the US; Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, San Francisco, etc have much higher living costs.  I agree with you that university and health care should be less of a concern than they are here.",
            "It's a strange thing. There are many things that are significantly cheaper here than in many other countries. Gasoline is an easy example. \n\nBut then rent becomes ridiculously high, to the point where it's not feasible to rent and live off of one minimum wage job in many cases, especially in bigger cities like New York.",
            "I'm in Northeast Ohio. We are a married couple with 3 kids. We make ABOVE what a $15 minimum wage would be, but here's our expenses to compare with, to see if even 15 wage would cover it: \n\nOur monthly mortgage payment is $1200 on a house we bought for $160,000. This is a low middle class neighborhood.  Most recent gas bill was 190. Electricity 60. Water/ sewer 150. I cook all our meals at home. Basic stuff, pasta, meat, rice, the only \"splurge\" items are that we do get organic yogurt and milk. Sometimes organic chicken from Costco. Our groceries are usually about 800 a month, including things like laundry soap and paper towels, diapers, soap etc. We have one car that's paid off gas is about 35.00 every 3 weeks. Internet $78. Phone bill $90. We pay about $220 a month for health insurance that doesn't even cover anything until after an additional $5500 deductible. (Edit: I said this wrong. It's 220 per pay check, so every 2 weeks. 440 a month) We don't go to movies. We buy clothes for our kids on sales at basic stores like Target and Kohls. We don't take vacations. We don't eat out. This isn't a luxurious lifestyle.\n\nSo everything I just told you for the basics is $2823. That's just the basics I'm remembering. There would be car insurance, registration, home repairs/maintenance costs I'm not figuring in. So we'll say $3000+. But this is a boring, average family spending 3000 a month just for the absolute basics, and we would have to add more for actual clothes and birthday gifts and shoes etc. Like we have to spend 800 this month to get my son an oral surgery that he needs for his adult teeth to come in properly. \n\n$15 an hour is about $2400 per month before taxes, so about $1900 after taxes. A family living a basic decent lifestyle like ours can't make it on $15 an hour. If both parents work these jobs, that's maybe $3800 a month. But then they would have to pay childcare for their kids. That childcare would cost them more than the second income actually brings in.\n\nEdit: to add that obviously there are dozens of factors that make expenses higher or lower for you and your location. This post isn't to claim that this is somehow exactly right, or the answer to what everyone goes through. Just a snap shot of an average middle of the road American family. Could my grocery bill be lower? Sure, I could buy the cheapest, lowest quality foods available from Walmart and Aldi. Obviously the numbers can and do change for everyone, everywhere. My point for OP is why can't minimum wage support life in America? Well, because America is goddamn expensive. You could scrape by on minimum wage in a few areas, but who wants to just scrape by?\n\nRegarding 1200 mortgage: that's mortgage, property taxes and home owners insurance all in one payment.\n\nAnd this doesn't even consider our debt; credit cards, student loan and a medical bill I've been paying off from my last pregnancy/ daughter's birth. This wasn't meant to be a full budget disclosure or financial TED Talk. Just a rough idea of basic needs.\n\nMy final note: many are commenting, based on their perspective, that this is expensive or this is cheap, or this isn't accurate. My purpose is only to give an example of how a basic decent lifestyle (not poverty level, nor upper middle class 'well off') cannot be sustained for a family on minimum wage. I didn't say WE make minimum wage, and I didn't say my situation was bad or good.  We are OK, we appreciate what we have, we make above minimum wage but are firmly low middle class. There are a lot of variables, I'm not a financial advisor, just telling you off the top of my head what's going on with a regular family out there right now. You can decide if the current system is working or not, or how much is needed. A lot of people are struggling now and coming from different situations, so try to understand each other. We are all just trying to live out here. Thanks for the interesting conversation.",
            "$15 an hour is pre-tax, and that's what people are saying minimum wage should be. Federal minimum wage is actually $7.25 an hour, pre-tax.\n\nAny visit to a doctor is hospital is usually crazy expensive, especially if you work a minimum wage job because we don't have universal healthcare. Our health insurance is provided through our employers, if we qualify for it. Higher education at a top university is closer to $50,000 (44,446 \u20ac approximately) per year.",
            "It's not so much stupidly expensive as it is imbalanced with what it costs for rent/housing/etc.\n\nThey also take out a fair bit without really providing much back.\n\nYou get money taken out for universal health care. We lose like 7-8% to cover social security and medicare, but that's only for the elderly. I'd still have to pay another $1000 of so for my insurance if I didn't live in Massachusetts or California (soon).\n\nEven with that Massachusetts still has a huge housing shortage. Rent is kinda insane. $1000/month won't even get you a single room apartment.\n\nIf you're lucky, you're paying like 50% of your pay just towards rent here.",
            "\u201cA person working full-time (40 hours per week) all year (52 weeks per year) at the current federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour earns a gross income of $15,080 per year.

This guy who was screaming in pain because his back and neck were in unbearable pain, went white when they told him he would be airlifted to a hospital.\n\nHe said he didnt have health insurance and was worried about the helicopter bill while his back was broken.\n\nThis is America.",

            "Health care is not socialized here. I got charged $975 for a doctor to tell me I had an ear infection and prescribe me antibiotic ear drops. EAR DROPS! Are you kidding?

            "*By living in italy my university expenses are really low, for an higher education in a top 1% University I pay only 2000,00 \u20ac a year.*  \n\n\nI cant take a SINGLE class for that, here at our state run university. Between the fees, books, registration, tech fees, etc, it comes out to more than that. Locally they're 350$ a credit hour, with each class having 5 credit hours--ones with labs, like science and tech, have 6 credit hours.   \n\n\nI paid more per semester than your 2k, back in the YEAR 2000. Just the tuition cost, no books, no fees, nothing else, just tuition was like 2500--a semester.   \n\n\nThe insurance thing is massive, if you're making 15$--you're not paying for insurance. You cant afford it. I was making 18$ and my insurance premiums (the part they take out of the check before it gets to me) was 360$ a pay period. That's every 2 weeks. It covered NOTHING until i was 6k out-of-pocket (so to even USE that shit that i was paying 720$ for a month, i'd have to spend 6k to start to use it--and even THEN it coveres only 80%).   \n\n\nThe average American's healthcare costs them 12k a year right now.   \n\n\nI have coworkers, who work JUST for the insurance--they PAY payroll, to cover the gap. They're working 40+ hour weeks and DONT GET A PAYCHECK--their family of 5's health insurance costs more than they make, so they take part of their wives pay from being a teacher, and pays payroll to pay up their insurance. He makes 21$ an hour.   \n\n\nthis is before we get to the rent. That's, on average, for a single bedroom, about 1100$--In my area, a two bedroom now is averaging 1970$ a month. Housing prices went up 30% last year--and are now well over 400k for the median sale.   \n\n\nThe US is royally fucked.",

            "The US worker with minimum wage pay is currently making less money pre-tax than you currently make post-tax, and has little or no help with health care or education costs, both of which are insanely expensive now. \nThe $15 that we're trying to get put in place for our lowest paid workers still would be pre-tax and not including heath care/education.",
            "We own cars because most cities have no comprehensive public transportation. \n\nI don\u2019t know how many people have streaming and satellite. No one that I know. \n\nWe also have incredibly expensive health insurance which we pay for monthly. Then we still have to pay to go to the doctor (copay at the door) and then get an additional bill after the doctor that we paid already to see. And we have no idea how much the bill will be, it\u2019s a fun surprise a month or two later! Our healthcare can be financially crippling and somehow we have been fed a steady stream of propaganda to take it.",
            "My husband had a heart attack five years ago. He needed emergency surgery and had two stents placed. Everything considered, he had an optimal experience in the hospital and a short stay of three days. We have premium BlueCross/BlueShield insurance. Our bill was over $120,000.00 of which we still owed roughly $18,000 out of pocket. For profit health \u201ccare\u201d is obscene.",
            "When people talk about hourly pay in the US, the amount is always before taxes. \n\nAs for surgeries, I would guess that many minimum wage workers do not have to worry about paying for surgeries, because they could not afford to have one or take time off of work. But there are still a lot of lesser medical bills they would have to worry about. For example, (from my experience) a trip to the emergency room is always going to cost at least $1,000. How much of that insurance will cover varies greatly depending on your insurance, or if you even have insurance. A lot of low paying jobs keep their workers at a low enough number of hours a week so they don't have to offer them health insurance.",
            "Would you be able to raise a family on minimum wage in Italy? Often students take wage/life style hits for a promise of better life style after getting there degree. I am not trying to say that students don't deserve fair payment. I am just trying to point out that maybe your perspective is different.  Obviously we could do analysis of PPP, wages etc, but its important to think about your life goals. Do you think you will work as pizza delivery for the next 10 years? Would you be able to raise a family, buy a house, go on vacation? Or are you making enough to survive college years?",
            ">about 15$ an hour\n\nThis is not the norm.\n\nOfficial minimum wage (delivering pizzas) is $4.65.\n\nBecause drivers get tips.\n\nNon-tipped minimum wage (in ohio) is $9.30.\n\nSo, not all that much higher than you're getting right now.\n\nAt the federal level, minimum wage is $7.25/hr. Probably less than what you make.\n\nItaly has an incredible healthcare policy.\n\nHere in the USA, a mildly decent health insurance plan for 2 healthy young adults might be 200-300$ per month every month, out of pocket.\n\nAlso, the USA is a little more expensive to live in. Conservative estimates say about 20% ish more expensive.\n\n$15 an hour as of 2 years ago ISN'T common.\n\nThis is a VERY new and controversial work environment. The US government began unemployment benefits that paid more than minimum wage. Worker made more money staying at home, than they did going to work.\n\nSo, naturally, people stopped going to work.\nMinimum wage workers have been pushing for 15$/hr for years. Accounting for inflation, 10 years ago, this was impossible. Now days, it really isn't that much of an increase.\n\nNow, mix both of those ideas AND the inherent risks associated with working in retail or food service (minimum wage jobs) in terms of covid, and you have a problem.\n\nThere was a MASSIVE labor shortage. Stores closed, businesses folded, and supplies chains started drying up.\n\nNow, businesses are a LOT more willing to negotiate for better wages, because they just NEED people doing work, or they don't have a business.\n\nAnd now, 15$/hr really isn't that bad...\n\nThe problem is, when covid slows down, people start coming back to work, and people have to pay rent again, businesses are going to fire an awful lot of employees, and rehire new people willing to work more for less money.\n\nIt's a tale as old as money.\nIn simple terms: The fickle \"proletariat\" have realized they don't have to seize the means of production, they ARE the means of production, in an environment that favors them.\n\nAnd the \"bourgeoisie\" are willing to spend gold to placate the masses... for now.\n\nIt's positively ORWELLIAN.\n\nFYI, I'm not a marxist... it's just a convenient, multinational metaphore.\n\nEdit: i totally forgot... tipped employees that earn less than minimum wage from earning+tips MUST legally be reimbursed the difference by their company.\n\nTipped employees are not ever legally paid less than minimum. They are paid at LEAST minimum, if not more.\n\nIf you are a tipped employee, being paid less than minimum wage, talk to your boss, or file a complaint with the Department of labor. You're worth it.",
            "Yes, $15/hour is pre-tax. And a top level university costs over $50000 per year. And we don't have universal health care, so even with insurance your surgery probably would have cost a few thousand dollars.\n\nSo yes, people complain about $15/hour because in most places that's not enough to even pay your monthly rent let alone buy groceries or pay for stuff like medical bills or schooling.",

            "We pay a lot for health insurance in the US and the prices vary wildly. On top of that, because insurance companies are a for profit industry they are incentivised to pay for as little as possible, even though we pay them the agreed upon amount every paycheck.\n\nAlso, as others have stated, the federal minimum wage in the US is $7.25/per hour and has been for over a decade at this point with no adjustment for inflation in sight.",
            "Having lived in both countries for part of my life there are some commodities that are cheaper in the US and some cheaper in Italy or the EU in general. There are 3 big factors that imo drive the minimum wage debate and why it seems odd to someone from the outside.\n\n1. There are some areas (LA, NYC, SF and Seattle for example) where the cost of living mostly in rent is astronomically higher than in neighboring cities and due to a lack of significant public transit (nyc excluded) people either choose to or are forced to lived in these expensive areas for work/school\n\n2. There is a significant lifestyle difference, when I lived in Italy my friends generally had less things. In general they had less outfits, didnt even always have a tv, less decor/furniture and typically spent more time outside of their apartment than my American friends who almost all had a new big tv, a car, latest video game system, tons of clothes etc. \n\n3. There is a portion of the population that believes minimum wage = minimum living wage. As in if my spouse and I both worked minimum wage jobs we could afford our home, cars, and whatever expenses working fastfood, retail etc. I never got that impression in Italy where as you mentioned your low wage is something youre doing during school while you have minimal expenses, its not an expectation for life that you can live on 7 euro/hour.\n\nThere are obviously other factors but this to me seems like the driving force and some of the biggest differences in mindset",
            "I live in one of the poorest and top 10 in lowest cost of living states in the US. Minimum wage is currently $7.25 an hour or roughly $290 a week without taxes . Average cost of rent without utilities is around $600-700 a month at least. Tuition at the local state college which is ranked 48th of 138th in southern universities has a cost of $10,000 a year for just tuition for in state students. Out of state students have to pay closer to $15,000 a year. Private healthcare insurance is hundreds a month and doesn't fully cover the cost of doctors visits. There are still co-pays and deductibles that have to be met. Basically we are getting screwed in the US.",

            "I think also it's important to talk about value. If you go to an average sandwich shop in Italy and pay 6 Euro, you'll get a solid takeaway sandwich, possibly with bread made from scratch in house, probably with spreads made from scratch and maybe in house, with reasonably generous portions.\n\nIf you go to an average sandwich shop in the US and pay 7 dollars, you will get...a 6\" subway sandwich made with overly sugary dough that becomes something resembling sticky foam, bottom of the barrel cheese and meat, and pale, lifeless vegetables. Along with sauces that are mostly low quality vegetable oil.\n\nAnd you *can* get the same quality of sandwich as in Italy, but you will have to go to a larger city, and you will probably have to pay minimum $15",

The cities with the jobs tend to be more expensive, just like in Italy.\n\nGDP per capita in the US is $63k, while it's $44k in Italy.\n\nOverall, it is cheaper to live in the US, largely because Italy is a more densely populated country.\n\n[https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare\\_countries\\_result.jsp?country1=United+States&country2=Italy](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_countries_result.jsp?country1=United+States&country2=Italy)",

            "I\u2019m also Italian and currently living in the states. \nWhat I can tell you is that salaries in the states are definitely higher but you have to pay for literally everything here. This is based on the fact that everything is privatized so it is up to the individual to seek out all the services he/she requires. That $18 minimum wage in some states is going to have to pay for health insurance, bills, insanely inflated housing market etc. I live in the suburbs and I even have to pay for private garbage disposal. An unlimited cellphone plan is like $80-100 per month while in Italy it was like $20. A shitty Starbucks espresso costs $5, while an espresso at caff\u00e8 Pedrocchi was barely \u20ac1.20 (last time I was there). And we are talking about one of the best and most famous Cafe in Italy, a country which already has a fairly high standard for espresso. I payed over $150k for my college education while an average Italian may spend around \u20ac10-20k if not free.\n\nIn the states I may make 250k a year but at the end I\u2019m still in debt. In italy I made around \u20ac120k per year (including 30 days paid vacation plus all the Italian national holidays) after taxes had basically no expenses. All pocket money. What I made went straight to the bank. Cus let\u2019s face it\u2026 everything expensive is free in Italy. Or at least everything that drains my bank account in the states. \n\nThe good thing about the states is that you earn a lot and fast. The problem is that you spend it even faster than you can earn it. \n\nThe problem with Italy, well all that free shit has a cost too. Which means that the job market is much more dynamic here in the U.S., making it a lot easier to find a job fast if you are qualified, compared to Italy where everything is idillic until you have to find a new job for whatever reason\u2026 well good luck with that if you are young\u2026\n\nEdit: just as a side note my dog ate a 5ft ribbon while I was living in Manhattan a few years ago and had to undergo emergency surgery.\n\nAfter 5 days in the intensive care unit the bill was $20k\u2026 10k after private insurance (and thank god I chose the higher coverage option).\n\nI would have payed 100k, 200k whatever cus I love my dog more than life itself but come on\u2026 important thing is he is fine. \n\nI called my old vet from Florence and he said the same procedure at a superior veterinary clinic in Tuscany would have cost me \u20ac2000-3000.\n\nWell all that matters is that he is ok, but I don\u2019t know how many more \u201cemergencies\u201d I could afford.\n\nIf I ever got sick I would hop on the first plane to Milan and enjoy some of the best medical care money can buy, for absolutely free.",

Obviously if we made just enough to survive we wouldn't have any quality of life, especially if emergency stuff came up.   \n\n\nThe biggest things are that we don't have kids and have paid off everything we could so we don't have to pay for cars, phones, credit cards, loans, etc. Those things eat up your paycheck quick.",

            "Minimum wage in most of the country is about what you make. 15 dollar minimum is what people are fighting for. \n\nAnd yes, our expenses are typically much higher. For example, health insurance alone costs my wife and I 600 per month (and that is after my employer helps to pay part of it). I live in a townhouse and we pay about 2.5k a month to live there total. It is impossible to get anywhere without a car, so that's about 100 per person in car insurance. \n\nAt the end of the day, for 2 people to scrape by my area, they will need to make about 60k combined, bare minimum. 15 dollars an hour would just barely meet that requirement, while 7.25 (current minimum wage) would be half of what is needed.",

College is $40k per year for a decent university. Someone making $15 an hour might get $2k per month after taxes working full time. Of that 800 goes to rent, $50 to car registration, maybe another $100 for gas, and insurance would probably cost you about $150 per month. That\u2019s leave you about $900 left to pay for food and other basic living expenses. Also, minimum wage is close to $8 than $15.

            "The thing is, if you look at Reddit as a representation of the US, the picture will be very skewed. The uncomfortable reality for many people here is that things really aren't that bad. For example, in 2019, it was estimated that less than 2% of the population was making minimum wage. If you look at median wages, you'll see most people make quite a bit more, but scrolling through Reddit, you get the impression that like a third of Americans are living on minimum wage. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLike many others have said, rent is the big one that is insanely high in cities and more desirable suburbs. Even home prices plummet pretty drastically once you look outside of these high traffic areas though. For example, I remember driving through Dallas suburbs 2 years ago and saw basically mansions for the same price as a small condo down here in South Florida where I live. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHealthcare is another big cost, but is also very poorly explained on Reddit. Obama's affordable care act made healthcare for people making even up to like 130% or so of minimum wage essentially free, but people need to take the initiative and sign up for the program / choose a plan and many just don't for some reason. Healthcare here is the biggest cost factor for the middle class actually - people making 3-5x minimum wage. They're the ones who got screwed and are basically paying for the healthcare expenses of those covered by the affordable care act. \n\nAll in all, some things are more expensive, but the situation here is really nowhere near as bad as Reddit makes it seem, and now for saying that, I'm ready to be downvoted into oblivion."

Unless this feeling is coming from deep insecurity or sense of worthlessness that a therapist needs looking at, I'd just go with what feels comfortable for you. Some people just need to find someone they connect with before their instincts kick in. A few will even find out that they're happier alone, though I wouldn't conclude that this early.",

I started fooling around when I was 13, started having sex at 14, and by 17 I was sleeping with men in their 20s and 30s and lying about my age. Until I was 21, I was constantly putting myself in situations I didn't really want to be in, simply because I felt like if I did, I would be seen as the \"cool, sexy, mature, etc...\" girl and that would give me value. \n\nI'm now 27 and in the healthiest most stable relationship I could have ever asked for.

So my experiences as a teen were bound to be different from my peers. It's quite common for lgbtq+ folks to be late bloomers as another commenter has mentioned, comphet is a thing.\n\nMaybe one of those labels might resonate with you, maybe they won't, either way you are not weird or broken for feeling this way.",
            "That\u2019s a more mature outlook than most 17 year olds have. Yeah, I\u2019d say that is normal. You\u2019re just doing a better job at identifying your own maturity level than many people your age who aren\u2019t ready for sex but pursue it anyways.",

To be honest, the pressure to be involved in romantic and sexual relationships is WAY too high.\n\nI'll be 20 on Saturday, and have never kissed anyone, had sex with anyone, I've never even been on a date. I don't feel ashamed of it because I know I'm whole, valid, and lovable with or without sex and romance.

You could just be a \u201clate bloomer\u201d, but whether that\u2019s the case, it can be nice to have a label for what you experience and know that you aren\u2019t alone.",
            "I just into a committed relationship pushing thirty and still feel like a high school drop out when it comes to romance. Granted, I was getting married when I was younger, but that was due to a harsh upbringing that put too much emphasis on being independent rather than being mature with your own decisions. These two factors are not related.\n\nMy suggestion: Listen to your gut. Find out what the feelings are telling you and learn from them. When you get into a healthy relationship, you will find that it can help both you and your partner in the long-run without complicating anything any further than necessary.",
            "I felt like that until I turned 21. Take your time and do like you want. There is n reason for you to compare yourself with those around you.",

Me being a 9th grader and having the ability to drive was such an awful idea to me that I didn't want a lisence. Meanwhile all of my friends have one and now I feel like wuss... So now my scooter just waits outside...",
            "No - if anything you are showing maturity for being self aware. You know how many people get in the \u201coops we has kid and I hate you....\u201d situation. Be smart and let it all be natural",

            "Hey! I\u2019m 17 too and somewhat feel the same. All my friends had lost their Virginity and recently one of them started to pressure me, which made me 500% more uncomfortable. However I decided to give it a shot with a guy I met but I\u2019m taking things reaaaaaaally slowly",
            "This is absolutely normal. While society has standards for what age we\u2019re adult, every person matures in their own time. Some bloom early, others late. The important thing is not to force yourself into something you\u2019re not ready for. Allow yourself time to pursue your interests and find out who you are. Self-discovery is a wonderful journey. When the time is right, you\u2019ll know and be ready for them. \n\nI also want to note, that there are people out there who aren\u2019t interested in romantic relationships, sexual relationships, or both. And this is ok too. The important thing is to know yourself and make decisions that are good for yourself and your growth.",
            "I\u2019m 17 as well, and I can assure you, I feel the same way. I was in a relationship in the past, but looking back on it, I wasn\u2019t ready and just kinda winged through the whole thing. It\u2019s like what everyone\u2019s said. Take your time, you\u2019ve got plenty for that stuff.",
            "You don't need to be normal.  We all go at our own speed. I'm not sure normal even really exists, and if it does, it's not worth emulating.\n\nNow I'm not sure you're ever really ready. I say this a 39 year old man who's been happily married for 9 years.",

            "Yes. Even if it's not \"normal\", it doesn't matter. Everyone matures and grows at their own pace, don't let people around you make you feel like you have to do certain things. I've known people like you who forced themselves into early relationships and there is really no benefit to that. \n\nLive your life at your own pace.",
            "Normal and valid. I cannot stress the importance of spending time on yourself and by yourself enough. When I was a little older than you I made sure to give myself that time. Learning to be with yourself and how to be happy that way will help you see relationships as something that is meant to add value. So many people maintain relationships that subtract value because they never learned how to be alone.",
            "Yup, I wasn\u2019t emotionally mature enough to want anything romantic or sexual till my last month of high school",
            "At Your age all you need to do is focus deeply on yourself and the right person will come along, it works like that every single time. In these times it feels like you should have it all together but, the truth is no matter what age you are no one ever has it \"ALL\" together. My grandfather is 100 and he says he still tryna get his shit together lol. So no pressure.",
            "Honestly there is no magic number / age where you should suddenly feel \u201cready\u201d. Sex and romance are some of the few things that are 100% up to you. Nobody has any right to tell you where you should be at in that process. Take all the time you need, homie.",
            "It is normal, but don't worry too much about being normal anyway, you know what's not normal? Being normal in every aspect of your life, now that's a true freak!\n\nAnd as for socially acceptable, there aren't many times it comes up in a social context!",
            "Yes.",

So yeah, it's perfectly normal, acceptable, and you deserve respect if you realized that you're not ready yet, it would make you less likely to end up in something toxic .",
            "You're probably more mature than anyone your age in a relationship",
            "Totally normal! Please don\u2019t feel pressured to pursue anything you\u2019re not ready for.",
            "It\u2019s normal, and tbh, I hope you\u2019re asexual and aromantic because honestly? It\u2019s all a giant waste of time when so many better things are available to do. I wish I had no desire for sex or romantic relationships, I could spend so much more time being productive. Focusing on your hobbies, your interests, your work, and your education are all a thousand times better ways to use your time.",
            "Yes, it is normal that you feel that way. In my country, you can even get married at 15-17 years old, provided you have the permission from both parents or legal guardians...\n\nMarried? At 15? Well... Yeah!",
            "The top comments on this post are absolutely correct. \n\nBe yourself and act the way you want. Invest your time into the hobbies you care about and the things you want to master. You will meet people in your life that care about the things you care about - or have associated and complementary interests / habits - so it\u2019s important to work on your individual identity before making any long term decisions with a partner. \n\nWith that said, there is a lot to be learned from practicing in the realm of interpersonal / romantic relationships. Partnering with another human being is hard, and making mistakes as an older adult can be different than making mistakes as a young adult. I won\u2019t say either is better or worse, just different. \n\nMake sure you\u2019re still learning how to coexist with another person and building strong friendships that test difficult human emotions like forgiveness, understanding, honesty and vulnerability. Consider what makes you uncomfortable about romantic relationships and try to observe how your actions with your friends or family relate to those feelings. \n\nAll in all, just focus on how to be a good friend, how to strengthen your existing friendships, and how to make new friends.",

You don\u2019t know what it is to be a proper human yet. Don\u2019t be surprised if you can\u2019t tell what a proper partner is. Work on yourself, feed your mind and curiosity. Girls or boys aren\u2019t going to suddenly disappear. And if you\u2019re really lucky, by the time you are ready you won\u2019t be such an asshole as to make life a living hell for your partner.",

I lost my virginity at 14, had a couple other experiences with guys and gals but soon after just didn\u2019t want to pursue that side of life yet. I clipped it all. Didn\u2019t want a boyfriend all throughout high school, friends asked me out but I said no and we\u2019ve all remained friends, even to this day. \nI can\u2019t tell you the feeling I had, it didn\u2019t really make much sense, but I knew what I wanted and I stuck with it. I wasn\u2019t waiting for the \u201cright guy\u201d, it was more like I wanted to be Peter Pan for as long as I could. To be young and have fun and not be full of cum \ud83d\ude0a",

            "I think this is a result of Hollywood and the media sexualizing teens and basically children. From teen movies that always seem to show a make out scene or imply they\u2019re sexually active, to the pornography industry targeting and recruiting 18 year olds. At 18 you\u2019re still basically a child figuring out the world, your pre-frontal cortex isn\u2019t even developed fully. It\u2019s really disturbing how they normalize and promote teens to be \u201cmature\u201d, mature really being a dog whistle for sexually \u201cmature\u201d or experienced. It\u2019s an insult to be called a virgin, even at such a young age. \n\nThis is in conjunction with the laughable state of sex education in the US, as well as family planning classes. You don\u2019t even know the risks of different forms of unprotected sex, or if you do go on birth control the hormonal effects of that on your mood, affect and even personality. \n\nIt\u2019s completely absolutely normal to be \u201cinexperienced\u201d at such a young age as 17. You should go at your own pace, not what is considered the societal \u201cnorm\u201d.",

            "The most important thing is your happiness. If forcing yourself into a relationship is going to make you feel uncomfortable, don't feel like you have to do it. When you meet the right person, it won't feel weird. Screw what society views as \"normal\". Have fun, do what you want, and be happy. Enter a relationship when you are ready.",
            "Sex differs from person to person. You\u2019re in the clear. But a word of wisdom? I don\u2019t think anything can truly prepare you for your first time. Wait as long as you want but know that you\u2019ll probably never know what the frick you\u2019re doing when the time comes, and your first partner probably won\u2019t be a life partner, and might still end very badly even if you wait for the perfect person. But they probably will take your virginity into consideration and make you comfortable.  I would say don\u2019t rush yourself, but also don\u2019t feel too intimidated either. It\u2019s easy to put sex on a pedestal regardless of which side of the coin you sit on.",
            "It\u2019s totally normal you have your whole life ahead of you! Just take your time you don\u2019t have to rush into a relationship if your not ready. Focus on yourself at the moment and when it comes it will feel like the right time!",

I wouldn't go looking for it though. Enjoy what you enjoy, sports, music, art, gaming, whatever.

            "I mean I think it's kinda outside the norm, but in a very good way. Many kids your age are somehow convinced that at 17 they have enough knowledge and good judgment to go full force into a relationship that only ends up lasting 6 months. (*ahem* Totally not speaking from experience or anything.)\n\nSo I don't think it's \"normal\", but it is most CERTAINLY not a bad thing in any capacity! And that reservation is a secret boon -- because if there is someone with which you end up having mutual affection, but they don't respect the boundaries you set, then you have an effective means of weeding out potentially very toxic people before becoming too emotionally invested in them.",

If the thought of romantic and/or sexual relationships is totally, 100% uninteresting to you, then you could be aromantic and/or asexual. \n\nAbsolutely nothing wrong with that either! Aces are cool! \n\nThis is just an idea, could be plenty of other things but always good to understand the possibilities.",

Also this is the only social media that she has.\n* She was in the foster care system and moved around a lot as a child, which could explain disrupted schooling.\n* She isn\u2019t in college and has no interest in going, she said because she always struggled in school and sees no reason to subject herself to it as an adult.\n* I\u2019ve never seen her read a book or even a magazine, and when I see her on her phone she\u2019s usually on IG or playing Match 3 games but never reading an article that I can remember.\n* I once let her borrow my copy of the book that her favorite movie is based on, because she mentioned that she\u2019d never read it. She gave it back to me a few weeks later claiming that she never found time to read it and felt bad that she was holding it hostage.\n\nAm I crazy, or does it sound like I\u2019m onto something here?

            "I'm a special education teacher and I work with lots of students with severe dyslexia who don't know how to read in the traditional sense. Rather they've learned to read by recognizing sight words, IE commonly and frequently occurring words in English language. They can usually recognize these words by a beginning consonant and maybe a vowel in the middle and then they guess the rest of it. A lot of times they're right, but often they're wrong. I also suspect this woman probably has some sort of severe reading difficulty that likely wasn't addressed due to disrupted schooling. \n\nIt's highly unlikely she doesn't know how to read at all but if she does have a severe learning disability she may have some learned helplessness. As in, she may give up quickly when faced with words she doesn't know, which is probably a lot of words, and has not been trained to identify and push through these moments of frustration. I see this all the time with my students and even with the highest level of support, many of them are still constantly frustrated and embarrassed by their struggles with reading.",

Tell her you want her to be comfortable around you and that you don't think any less of her.",
            "You might be right that she is illiterate. But going from the hints that she can remember things and knows how to help herself in tricky situations (she knew where to find what order in the program at work, she can overplay her inability to read in work and social life and that you don't know for sure after six months of dating...) I guess it's more a mix of dyslexia (or something similar) and being tossed around in foster care without a consistence education to notice it. She sounds like someone who would have figured out reading by now, if it would be something that she could do on her own. \n\nWhen you ask her about it, BE GENTLE! If she is really not able to read or only able to read really slowly, she isn't keeping up this charade to appear smarter. It's a defensive mechanism to not appear less educated than a first-grader. She might be ashamed. She might be scared of being found out. She might even lash out or tell you that you are insane, in a desperate attempt to cover up. You know her better, so you have to decide if you have to push or back off. But either way, please, be gentle and assure her that you love her no matter what. Show her that you want to help with the burden she carries around since years, not expose or mock her. But by the way you write about her, it is clear you care about her and these warnings are unnecessary. I hope all goes well.",

            "In med school, we were taught to ask patients who may be illiterate a question like this: \n\n\"How happy are you with how you read?\" \n\nThis would avoid the embarrassment or the superiority attached to questions like, \"Do you understand?\"/\"Do you know how to read?\"/\"How are your reading skills?\" \n\nGiven you are her boyfriend, you can probably modify the question as you see fit.",
            "I taught illiterate adults for 9 years and without meeting your SO personally it'd be impossible to say. Most adult illiterates memorize a few key words to pass and learn some functional work arounds like you describe. It is actually pretty easy to function in modern society without reading, you just need to know the mechanism of how words integrate with tech to get by, eg: you don't have to read street signs if you can recognize what an address and punch it into a GPS.\n\nA lot of people are saying \"she might be dyslexic\" but given what you list, it's entirely probable that any dyslexia she might have discouraged her from honing the skill. To be clear, dyslexia is not illiteracy, but can be a causal factor in illiteracy. When you're already learning on hard mode it can be discouraging to learn further. \n\nThere really is no easy way to confront this. If you like her, be patient and kind and she might make a confession some day. So long as she's able to function and is happy, she's fine, but if she wants more from school, or just the benefits thereof, she's going to have to make a choice to learn.",

Difficulties with remembering directions/navigating and/or recognizing people, vehicles, etc.?\n\nVisual processing difficulties and certain ocular issues can go underdiagnosed and be wildly difficult to catch if the person finds behavioral adaptations to cover them.\n\nEta: Missed the part about her being in the foster care system. Substantially raises the likelihood of either an undiagnosed learning disability or a missed sensory issue.",
            "Lots of good advice here. If I were you I think I would first educate myself about adult illiteracy (which is surprisingly common) and try to talk to someone at an organization that helps adult learners with literacy so you can speak knowledgeably with your girlfriend when you do bring it up. Then I think I'd find a quiet time, say there's something you want to talk about, and say you have the impression she struggles with reading, and you know that's actually not uncommon and there are new strategies these days for adults who want to learn reading skills, and that you'd be really happy to help (if that's true). \n\nShe may try to deny the problem at first out of shame, so you want to make sure you move quickly into saying whatever you can to indicate to her that you don't find it shameful and that it doesn't change how you feel about her (if that's true). Also I wouldn't demand an answer from her. You can say, \"you don't have to tell me anything. I just wanted to say this so you know how I feel,\" and leave it at that. Maybe she won't want to talk about it at first but will feel more willing later, after she's processed what you have to say.  \n\nIf you are right and she has minimal or no literacy, then it's incredibly impressive that she has come as far as she has and that she functions in the adult world despite the double barrier of not being able to read AND not feeling she can tell anyone about that. It shows how intelligent and resourceful she must be.",

            "Wow, this is an interesting question! I experienced a very similar situation at a very similar age. I was 21 and my girlfriend was 19. She had (what she/we thinks is) severe dyslexia and didn't graduate from high school, largely due to that. She can read and write at about the 1st-2nd grade level. She was also in the foster care system for much of her young life. \n\nHas your girlfriend never texted you? With mine she would use talk to text or sometimes write some stuff and it was extremely obvious to me that she had a serious writing problem. I somehow brought this up either to her or her friend (I can't remember) very early on and found out she had the disability. I actually just had a ton of sympathy for her about this because I knew it was not under her control.\n\nWe had only a few things in common so we talked about those things and eventually, 8 months later, she got (intentionally -- but that's another story) pregnant. We stayed together for another 2 years and then separated. We just didn't have enough in common and we couldn't have conversations that intellectually stimulated both of us and, looking back, I think that is what resulted in our relationship not being fulfilling for either one of us.\n\nOur son is with each of us 50% of the time, and one interesting note is that he skipped 1st grade because he is so intelligent (particularly math and science). He does write his numbers/letters backwards very regularly which is interesting. He hates reading too, which sucks. He is a math freak though and I love him to death. \n\nAnyhow, my recommendation, assuming you are looking for a long term partner, is to analyze whether or not you are able to talk and communicate on a similar level to her. Can she get as deep into thought as you need? Do you have similar interests? If so, the fact that she can't read or write doesn't matter, does it? Assuming she can get by without it, its really not a big deal if you ask me. Plus, if that is the case it is not something she has the control over -- just think about it. \n\nLastly, why don't you just ask her or someone she has known for a very long time if she can't read/write. I would bet my bottom dollar that if she can't read/write it is due to some underlying disability. Oh, and if you can't accept her for who she is then break it off sooner than later. It only will get harder with time.\n\nBest of luck!",

            "It's somewhat common in the US. I don't know where you're from, but one in twenty American adults [is functionally illiterate](https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2019/2019179.pdf), and one in five is \"low literacy\" (can't read a newspaper, or make inferences from or paraphrase things they've read).",
            "If she is illiterate or very dyslexic she might benefit from a screen reader; they're technically for blind people but should still help out a lot",
            "Honestly bro, i hope you see my comment in this ocean of comments, please convey to your girlfriend that she shouldn\u2019t feel bad about being an illiterate person, prophet Mohamed Pbuh was also an illiterate and he is the most influential person to 1.8 billion people.",
            "Might have undiagnosed dyslexia but I feel like an adult conversation from a very loving and understanding significant other is the way to go here.",
            "It\u2019s possible she cannot read or not read well. It\u2019s hard to gauge if you don\u2019t ask outright. I also don\u2019t know where you are located but I do know that most \u201eeducated\u201c countries have a higher rate of illiteracy than we, people who can read, assume. And her being a foster child does not make her illiterate but It raises the chances of her being one of the unfortunate ones. I\u2019d say listen to your gut. Even if she can read, I get the feeling she definitely cannot read *well* and I think your observations point in that direction.",
            "I think you can ask her. If you're worried about sounding superior, start out by complimenting her on something you like about her - a sincere complement. \n\nDepending on where you live, there might be adult literacy programs at the library. Or you could even offer to teach her. How? Go to a teacher supply store and buy some 1st or 2nd grade workbooks. At the library the children's books are \"leveled\", meaning if you ask the librarian to help you find 1st, 2nd and 3rd grade books, she'll be able to show you how to find those.\n\nBut most of all, tell her there is NOTHING to be ashamed of. Some people can read just fine, have Ph.Ds, but they are still cruel and hurtful humans. Reading is a practical skill, not a character trait.",
            "Sounds like a mixture of interrupted schooling and a bad case of dyslexia to me. Can't tell though. Anyways, good luck with whatever turns out to be the case, hope it all turns out well and you can support her in any way she needs (and vice-versa!).",
            "I laughed at this assuming this was a clever bullshit reddit post until the foster care part. Made me feel bad.",
            "My ex, I found out just before our wedding, could not read, barely write her name. She had an interest in cooking. Once I realized that she was struggling in a big way, I used the recipes to help her. I did it so gradually she almost didn\u2019t realize it was happening until she caught herself reading a cookbook for fun one day. She flat asked me if I had realized she couldn\u2019t read and helped her. I started to deny it, but finally said yes. \nWhile I feel I did the right thing by her, she ended up divorcing me claiming I manipulated her and if I was capable of doing it to teach her to read, what else had I done. \nTo this day she hates me for it even though she has had a fairly successful career with a major medical care system in our area a an AR/AP supervisor. A job she would never have been able to had she not been able to read. \n\nSMFH\u2026 some people. \nI would suggest sitting her down one day and ask her.  DO NOT be condescending. By supportive. Be kind. Ask her if she wants help, if she says no, leave it at that. But know you will be in a relationship with someone who will be intellectually stunted and will most likely put more value on whatever they hear because she will be unable to fact find on her own. She will be easily swayed and manipulated."
