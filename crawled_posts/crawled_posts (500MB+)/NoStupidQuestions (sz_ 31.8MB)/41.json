            "Something to think about whenever we discuss human evolution is the fact that homo sapiens are social creatures who (besides in the most extreme of cases) live and work within a group environment. Taking this into account, it actually makes evolutionary sense that our babies cry to communicate their discomfort as there is exceptional safety in being a part of a large family or tribe of apex predators. \n\nSo taking society into account, it may just be the case that babies who receive attention and care due to their fussiness tend to survive better than those who do not draw attention to themselves.",
            "We're social animals who live in groups. We use a lot of sounds to communicate, but that's made possible by the fact that there's always someone on guard for predators and we use fire and build walls and stuff. We've had variations on those things for a very long time. Humans as we know them were likely never booking it across the savannah alone with a baby who needs constant care and support and makes loud noises.\n\nCompare to something like a horse, who leaves the herd to give birth in silence and then the baby is on its feet in ten minutes so it can keep up with everybody.",
            "Predators who wander into a group of humans are in very, very big trouble.  It's not an accident that ancient megafauna went extinct whenever and wherever we showed up.",
            "It\u2019s also a great way to alert mommy you just fell off a cliff or got stuck in a tree.",
            "Because adults will do just about anything to make that loud cry stop, which means the baby gets its needs met. And we're pack animals. You wouldn't go after a sick wolf if he's surrounded by strong, healthy wolves.",
            "It's a good way to get their needs met quickly and increases the chances of survival.\n\nI can hear newborn lambs bleating very loudly at the moment, there are foxes around who are drawn to the sound. The mother sheep are invested in finding them and feeding them before a fox finds them first. It's a tactic that keeps them alive.\n\nPerhaps its the same with humans? A mother can't ignore the cries of her child, she can't leave it somewhere and forget about it till she feels like feeding it. Babies seem to be hard wired to be held constantly or at least be in the company of others till they can fend for themselves a little.",
            "Just so you know that loud cry is not the first one. If you're in tune with an infant they will give you several signals before crying loudly. Now imagine yourself in a hunter gather society no TV no distractions just you and your swaddled infant and your basket weaving or Berry picking or whatever. Chances are you will notice the warning signs of discomfort or need far before the baby screams. It will happen, they will cry but not nearly as much as you think.   parents that practice attachment parenting don't hear baby cries as much.",
            "Thinking of every human trait and behavior in the context of cavemen is a huge mistake.\n\nIn general though, it\u2019s been a very long time since humans were seriously concerned about predators attacking them in their dwellings. A pride of lions is never going to attack a group of even 10 people. And just think of hunter gatherers- small groups of people in the open walking around for any predator to spot them\n\nLarge predators work under the assumption that when they attack the pack of prey will scatter so they can comfortably pick off a straggler, but humans don\u2019t have the option of running, so we are uniquely equipped to resist large predators attacking our camps",
            "Humans are apex predators. There aren't really any predators that routinely hunt us and those that might try would usually regret it once they felt the sharp end of a spear or arrow.",
            "We\u2019ve evolved enough to intelligently protect ourselves from predators.",
            "Statistically, the benefits of alerting your parent(s) to your location/distress must outweigh the risks of alerting a predator.",
            "The answers here are great but yku also need to consider that evolution doesn't spit out the most efficient version of something. Evolution keeps what survives, it's a giant game of throw a bunch of shit at the wall and see what sticks.",
            "Bc due to the anatomic changes when humans started walking on two legs, the baby had to be born less developed and unable to live. Needing everything to be done for it, the screams need to attract.\n\nHowever, these changes happened when humans started to develop bigger brains due to the diet on non-raw meat. Due to the fire making this possible, they were relatively safe and also top of the food chain- the baby thus being safe under the protection of the tribe.",
            "We\u2019re social animals. The first way we are able to communicate is ask for help",
            "Babies have no real defense, they cry to summon their parents pretty much.  Human beings are fucking SCARY when we're defending our young, like apex predator shit, nothing is getting close to that baby.",
            "Here's a 7 minute video explaining it with a really serious scientific hypothesis (or not)\nhttps://youtu.be/Zm-sQnazFAQ",
            "There aren't really any predators for them now. I read recently that American babies were shown to cry more often than others, I guess it's because of how American people are with their babies?",
            "Polite, quiet babies starve to death.",
            "Babies actually doesn\u2019t cry that much when they\u2019re content though. I was prepared for the worst and thought that\u2019s exactly what having a baby was, constant crying. So I was happily surprised \ud83d\ude0a\n\nEdit: not saying that people with crying babies are bad parents. But yes, a content baby doesn\u2019t cry much. But there\u2019s a million things not to be content about when you\u2019re an infant. I mean everything hurts. The only familiar thing is the warmth and sounds of the mother.",
            "Seems like a great way to scare predators away.",
            "Evolution is trial and error. \n\nFor example:\nIn the very beginning a gene that made babies cry would attract a predator and get the baby killed, and maybe the parents too. Gene gone. (For now). The silent baby gene prevails. Then when humans were able to defend themselves against large predators, a crying baby wasn't an issue anymore. At that point a silent baby would slowly disappear from the gene pool as the babies needs aren't met because the parents might not realise something is wrong and the baby might die. And so the crying baby dominates the gene pool as a baby that cries will get attention sooner, increase its chance of survival and therefore more likely to carry on its genes. \n\nThis is very basic, it's a bit more complex than this, but it's a good idea on how it may have evolved.",
            "Babies cry as a way to let you know they need something. Food, diaper change, sick/uncomfortable/pain, etc.",
            "Human Birth is a communal activity. A baby crying means there a group of humans there, a smart small predator will keep away, a huge predator like a bear could pose a problem but we did outlasted bigger.",
            "Well, perhaps, and I dunno, this started happening more when you had a society around to protect the young, and keep predators away, and generally be The Dominant Race in the area... so you don't need worry about predators coming in to eat your babies?\n\nIf you've got predators around, and your race isn't The Master Of It's Domain, then yeah, I imagine wailing babies would be like beaconing tasty treats for any predators nearby.... and so prey-animals and those insecure in the domain would likely end up only keeping the quiet babies\n\nSo.... would we be right in thinking that if you're on an alien planet, and you come across a Loud As Fuck baby... that it could be from the Apex creature on the planet?",
            "Baby elephants make a lot of noise too.\n\nThe benefit of communication in a social species has a greater evolutionary benefit than the cost of alerting local predators to your presence.\n\nWhich kind of emphasizes how humans were never meant to be alone, and had more than immediate family to care for each other. This \"nuclear family\" suburban isolationism is fairly recent.",
            "they're making sure that mommy and daddy can never have time to fuck and potentially make another baby who will compete for food and attention.",
            "There is a theory (small t theory) that babies cry in part to prevent their parents from conceiving more babies. I know I've read about it but it still might be hokum.\n\nOn the other hand, I've only got one kid.",
            "Some time ago I was curious about this, too. I learned that if babies are not cared for when they cry, they eventually give up. And this happens rather quickly. So, if no one is around to take care of their needs, it seems like they stop crying to not attract the wrong kind of attention. There was also the suggestion that they stop relatively quickly to conserve energy.\n\nOf course, all speculative. I'm not an expert and I guess it's really hard to fully figure out what's going on in a baby's mind from a scientific point of view.",
            "The evolutionary goal is to make the caretaker as uncomfortable as the crying baby is to force an empathetic reaction.  As humans are diurnal animals the risk of alerting predators isn't as high and if there was a predator hanging out when a baby cries we wouldn't have any trouble outrunning them, especially during the heat of the day.",
            "It's not like adults are much quieter. Especially groups of 10+ people.",
            "Humans haven't had to worry about predators, at this least not to this extent, for at least a couple steps on the evolutionary ladder.\n\nPrimitive humans lived in tight knit social groups. If a sabertoothed cat or a dire wolf >!(and yes, those were real; they are not something Game of Thrones invented)!< heard a baby cry and came to the camp, they'd be greeted with spears and arrows from the tribe.\n\nThe only humans who'd have to worry about predators were lone hunter gatherers, and they'd probably just leave babies back at camp.",
            "That\u2019s our entire advantage of our species. Because we built such strong communities that protected against predators, we were able to have our babies do more risky things like cry to demand attention and also be helpless for years in order to focus on growing the brain instead of just surviving.",
            "My friend adopted a baby from an orphanage where the babies were changed at a set time and fed at a set time and when she got her little baby he didn\u2019t cry because he never associated crying with getting a need filled. After a couple months in her house he finally started crying as he learned that someone would respond when he had a need.",
            "This is personal experience, but babies are often very quiet when in unfamiliar surroundings or with strangers.  If the trusted adults are scared or tense, babies clam up.",
            "Humans aren't deer hiding in the undergrowth, ready to flee if a predator spots them. Humans live in groups and often build settlements, make fires, work and talk noisily, etc. Most of the time, humans aren't that hard for predators to find. Humans stayed safe by being able to defend themselves, not by hiding.",
            "When you get hungry you have a biological reaction, predators on-site an emotional reaction. They are too young to understand when they are in danger but have built in hunger reaction.",
            "They need stuff and that's the best way they know how to let it known, it gets quick response.",
            "Is it the babies, or is it their environment?\n\nBabies among indigineous tribes seem super chill.",
            "Lot's of great comments here, but all are slightly off the mark. From what I've read it's more than just communication, it's also to engender sympathy from adults who see this pitiful, helpless creature. Ask any parent and they'll tell you that after an hour of \"trying to get it to please shut the fuck up\", there's a sudden powerful bond formed when the child does suddenly shut up.\n\nA weird darker side of this is \"why does pregnancy hurt so much?\" Other animals (even primates) give birth without much pain. Sure, we have larger heads and smaller hips, but if anything that's a reason to turn the pain sensors DOWN not up. One theory is that the woman crying out during birth makes helping her seem that much more urgent. And if everyone helps the mother give birth they all feel like godparents to the newly born child. They are now all invested.\n\nAnd a child with 10 parents does better than a child with 2. It takes a village.",
            "\"I'm not locked in here with you, you're locked in here with me motherfucker\"\n\nThe real predator against wild animals are humans.\n\nMoreover, the real predaor against babies are humans that neglect them, and to some extent humans that just want to eat them, rape them, kill them.",
            "all the babies who didn't cry died bc their mothers wouldn't know when to feed them.",
            "Crying makes u take care of them\n\nAs they're children they can't take care of themselves or survive alone so they cry to attract attention (most of the times their moms)",
            "Humans babies are among the more vulnerable of infants in the animal kingdom. It's likely, yes even though it would attract predators, to be able to attract their parent as well.",
            "Humans are at the top of the food chain. The only thing preying on humans is other humans.",
            "Fwiw: Babies have tons of cues they give us way before crying happens. We just don't pay attention.\n\nThat said.. I think There are a few reasons for crying and they all go together. \n\nSimplistically speaking- We have babies to pass on our genes. A crying baby is very uncomfortable for adults to have to listen to because it sets off our internal alarm bells as humans are born extremely premature and so extremely vulnerable. Whatever the cause, crying gets the desired response quickly, effectively and efficiently so the baby has a better chance of survival. \n\nAnother way nature has ensured A baby's survival that dove tails with crying pretty smoothly is by giving them exaggerated features (ie: large eyes) that trigger a nurturing response in the adults near it.",
            "Social animals cry when in pain, whether they're prey or predator species. It is the means of communicating danger or the need for help to the other members of its social group. That does bring with it the chance of attracting predators. But the chance a predator may reach an infant first is outweighed by the 100% chance the infant will die of they're distressed and their social group cannot locate them.",
            "Imagine you're a robber and you need to rob people because you have no other source of income but you really like not dying or getting hurt while you do that.\n\nYou see a group that looks like a gang, they're blasting music and partying in the middle of the night. There's also a mother with her baby crying because it's way past the baby's bed time. Then down the street you see a guy by himself and he's walking with crutches. Who would you rob? \n\nSame applies for animals hunting for food. Loud babies are often offsprings of highly social animals that rely on numbers as defense. The crying is a way of communicating something is wrong with the baby and it needs care. That communicating outweighs the downside of attracting predators. Most of the time the predator hunts alone or the social animal numbers are significantly larger or intimidating for the predator pack.",
            "There is this book, I don't know the name in english but I think it's something around \"The silent death\" and it's about how the babies that don't cry, die. Because the mother forgets to feed them. Specially if there are several.",

            "I'd have a tough time trying to track it down, but I once saw some video about I think Russians who kept their babies in a backpack, in a much more remote area, and those babies didn't make noise.  Might have been on Survivorman?",

            "We *are* the predators.",
            "Much more awesome way to relay your position to someone who will fight a Predator for you.\n\nPredator will find you regardless",
            "When babies experience a problem, they make a noise that is nearly intolerable to adult humans (crying). This effect causes the adult to immediately solve whatever problem is affecting the baby. Apparently this arrangement was beneficial and worth whatever attention it may have drawn to us. I suspect not much of human history was spent hiding in silence to avoid predation. A bigger problem would be alarming our prey. This could be easily solved by sending the men on hunts rather than the babies.",
            "You wouldn\u2019t approach a wailing and seemingly alone bear cub, would you?",
            "Cool fact about human biology. Our ears are shaped in a way that amplifies 3-5kHz which is around the frequency of a babies cry. So that contributes to the perceived loudness. If our ears weren\u2019t shaped like this they wouldn\u2019t seem as loud.",
            "It\u2019s a great way to bring food closer for the band to kill. Seriously, early hominids were omnivorous hyperchimps, accompanied by a pack of dogs. We see color. Digest all sorts of stuff. Remember and plan. And have revenge. Any thing that dares touch a crying baby is not long for earth (along with all relations). \n\nSee John Wick. That was over a puppy.",
            "It\u2019s actually a beautiful process, and it would be difficult to design a better one.  Baby humans are basically helpless for the first 1-2 years of their life.  They are now even calling the first 3 months of life the \u201c4th trimester\u201d because of how helpless a baby is.  The only tool the baby has is to cry.  They cry when they are uncomfortable (wet diaper, hungry, tired, etc).  By doing this, they draw the attention of the adult who wants nothing more than to quiet the child because #1 it\u2019s not a pleasant sound and #2 for the reason you mentioned- if there are predators around, it\u2019s in parental best interest to quiet the baby for safety.  This becomes the basis for our communication development- I make a noise- you respond.  Because we learn through cause and effect, baby experiences discomfort- mommy/daddy hears crying and now too experiences discomfort due to the noise.  Mommy/Daddy responds and relieves baby\u2019s discomfort and baby is no longer uncomfortable.  Everybody wins.  And one final thing- crying is pretty much baby\u2019s only exercise for the first few months and it helps to strengthen the lungs.",
            "I mean it more so is used as a way to relay location to the mother or father or adult nearby. Human beings as social as they are have adapted from birth to rely on external protection and an external learning period far surpassing any other species in duration. The louder it is the further away you can hear it. \n\nThen of course is the fact that in the past few hundred thousand years we've become more and more formidable as predators and larger in general. I mean most animals aren't really dumb, they know trying to go for a protected baby means death in most cases even if they are successful to begin with in getting it. Animals are always looking for the easiest way to get dinner and get on with their day, an infant crying if anything likely wards away a lot of animals in a setting like say a woods. At the end of the day most things you encounter even up to the things larger than humans are just terrified of us or if they're young enough at worst theyre curious or trying to defend an area and want you to leave. They do really go out of their way towards us and when they do like the cases of maneating tigers or lions its usually a food scarcity issue approaching it no longer being a choice or the animal had some sort of brain injury or injury in general that prevented it from getting its normal less risky prey items",
            "Human babies need close care, unlike a fawn for instance, a human baby is completely dependent on its parent.  Crying alerts the parent to a need, and the necessity to take care of that need NOW.  A parent's interaction with their child also increases the bond both ways.  If you look at societies, today, without a lot of child proofing you'll notice, usually the mother, keeping the child close to the body in a sling.  A child this way does not cry very much, it's usually when the child is put down, separated that they'll cry.",
            "side note, babies don\u2019t cry as loud as you think. Human hearing is most sensitive at the frequencies typical of a crying baby. Other animals don\u2019t experience baby crying as being nearly as loud",
            "Crying is the infant's demand for care and attention. It says to the mother, \"keep trying\" until she figures out what the baby needs.\n\nHumanity was always effective at being out of reach or otherwise dealing with predators.",
            "As if animal babies don\u2019t cry out when in need. Human babies just cry *more* because human society has evolved to not tend to children when needed.",

            "Just the fact that pretty much every baby in the world cries shows that this wasn\u2019t really an evolutionary disadvantage",
            "I like what /u/S_p_M_14 said.\n\nThink about it from another way though: by being so loud and so annoying, you can be sure parents will attend to them immediately so they don't draw attention to the human herd at nighttime/when predators are around.\n\nIf you're a parent, it's either take care of that kids needs, **now**, or kill the child to keep it quiet. We live in a society now where we can leave the child crying for hours. There are no threats. The crying is just annoying to us. Well, it was annoying to us then, but we had to deal with it else face far worse consequences.",
            "Ugh. Just had a MASH finale flashback.",
            "Speculating here but:\n\nPredators ~~are~~ usually hunt alone or in smaller numbers. In contrast, humans live in large groups. Sure, there's a chance that the predators could maul an entire human group or that the humans could gang up on and overwhelm the predators, but think of this in terms of real life. In a game, the struggle ends when you win the fight. In real life, the struggle doesnt end until you die, whether you win the battle or not. Incredibly powerful predators like tigers choose to sneak up on prey because that minimizes energy expenditure as well as minimizes any possible wounds that may come from the struggle with the prey animal. This is a similar case. Predators can sneak up on and snatch an unattended baby, so babies have learned to make noise. A predator or three will not risk a struggle with an entire group of humans, very likely suffering wounds from the ensuing struggle and wasting much energy for a single low calorie baby. Its not an efficient use of resources for the predator.",

Feeding them BEFORE they cry out of hunger. As they grow older less often (every 3-4 hrs?).

Think of how absurdly strong a chimpanzee is and scale it up. It's not that they were biologically too much different from us, but their lifestyle suited them for their survival. However, I believe their bones were thicker, specifically their jaws, and arms were more bulky.\n\nPeople today are very sedentary. The average ape gets alot of exercise, and are on bred for murder. If a lion or cougar grabbed a baby, imagine a murderous gang of hyped screaming teenage males with thick hands and big tearing teeth.

If there is a lion crawling near the bushes where you are, you have a better chance of survival if you start screaming at the top of your lungs for help than if you stay silent, because most predators have an extremely evolved sense of smell, and there are few babies that are not...well...*pungent*. Furthermore, the sound of a crying baby triggers an evolutionary response in humans to drop whatever they're doing and fix whatever's causing it.",
            "I figure it's because it's annoying as hell.  Takes a couple of kids before you really get good at being able to ignore it.\n\nI think it's hilarious when non-parents/new parents get fed up .... \"Oh my GAWD!!  Make it stop!!\"  \n\nrofl .... newb.",
            "This always shocks people but remember that humans didnt stop evolving after they developed societies and civilization.  Why crying doesn't make much sense for a chimpanzee or Neanderthal living out in the open it 100% makes sense for a baby living in a shelter to scream until it's needs are met.",
            "Same reason why people involuntarily scream when they get startled... to draw the attention to themselves",
            "Have you ever seen the opposite? It's when they stop crying that things get ugly. My son came to me at 6mo after some pretty significant neglect. Didn't cry until he was about 18mo. He is 13 now and has an attachment disorder that makes his life extremely difficult.",
            "Everyone is mentioning the social animal aspect, which is good, but there\u2019s a deeper bit to it\n\nNotice how most animals are born just about ready to live their lives? Maybe they take a month or two to leave the figurative or literal nest, but beyond that they\u2019re essentially just a small adult? And then think about how baby humans take over a decade to become even a small version of an adult, and 2 decades to reach full maturity?\n\nDue to some evolutionary quirks, namely a small pelvis but large brains, humans are born prematurely, as compared to other animals. Essentially, we spend a comparatively very long time outside of the womb still gestating. \n\nHowever, this big brain-long time a baby thing came about because we had already reached a point where we lived in groups and were able to communicate well and even use tools, and most notably, fire.\n\nSo yes, a crying baby will definitely attract predators, but what animal, or even pack of animals, is going to attack a group of 10+ humans with fire, clothing, and spears, likely residing in some sort of rudimentary but still defensively advantageous spot, like a cave with a single entrance?\n\nBy the time babies and their crying would be a problem, humans were quite formidable to the vast majority of predators. Not much short of a bear or elephant would take on such a group, and even then likely not willingly.",
            "By crying, you get mom/dad to come feed you. The louder you cry, the faster - and from further away - mom's gonna come.",
            "An smart question I might say sir sadly I do not have an answer",
            "If you howl like a wolf near a baby they stop crying immediately also an evolutionary thing",
            "1. As humans, infants are like the absolute least capable mammal on the planet in terms of even existing without a caregiver.  Crying is the only way to communicate something is wrong and crying loud makes it unlikely for a cry to go unheard if it is being carried off by a dingo or something. \n\n2. Babies cry different for different things. Primary caregiver tends to learn from the cry alone what the baby wants/needs.\n\n3. A baby\u2019s cry will trigger lactation, thus making it a pretty useful tool in its survival kit. Which otherwise only consists of them being cute. If they weren\u2019t, humans would have died out long ago.",
            "I believe there are some studies that show that disrupting your parents \"alone time\" delays the birth of the next child, which increases the length and amount of your individual attention, and increases your chances of survival. \n\nSpeaking in the sense of pre-modern times. Obviously these days we're better equipped to care for multiple babies.",
            "My neighbors had a baby in November.  I hardly ever hear it but when I do it triggers something primal and maternal on me that makes me want to go knock on their door and see if I can help.\n\nI'm pretty sure they got it covered, so I resist the temptation.  I feel that way and it's not my kid, I'm sure the primal urge to take care of him is even stronger in his parents.",
            "I can't really speak from an evolutionary point of view, but having had two children, in my experience, if they cry *often*, then you probably need to either get them checked out by a pediatrician or look at the environment they are in.\nThey cry loudly so we are aware of their discomfort, but they really shouldn't be crying often.\nIn our experience, if one of our children cried, it is one of the following: A) Wet nappy B)Hungry C) Tired D) Wants cuddles.\nIf your  hold cries often, you need to find the underlying reason.",
            "It's also a great way to get your group's attention. I think they'd rather stop you crying before the predator comes and eats the entire community",
            "That's why we can't ignore the sound.",
            "Evolutionary psychologists/biologists talk about this kind of a thing a lot.  If you see something that looks like a disadvantage it is almost always the result of an equivalent or greater advantage. In this case, the advantage is is making sure the baby gets the attention of the parents, both for food and psychological needs.  Especially important if older siblings are being noisy! The baby needs to be sure it gets its mother's attention.  Predators finding the baby have been less and less of a problem as time goes on. It's safe to say in the thousands of years humans have lived in walled cities, the importance of being stealthy from predators has gone down, while the importance of having parental attention over siblings has gone up (or stayed the same)  \n\n\nIn addition, Babies crying is especially distressing to humans ESPECIALLY to females (who statistically hear high pitches better, and especially to the babies own mother)   \nA lot of animals cry in some way. Tiny kittens cry with their cute little squeaky cries. Humans find it adorable, but the mother finds it a little distressing and will go to her babies. Pretty much every species with infants that cry, do so at a pitch/tone that is especially distressing to that species mother.",
            "Well many things that play a role.\n\n1.we are really sensitive to the frequencies of baby crying, so we hear it much better than anything else.\n\n2. Baby's need close care and lack the ability to get attention otherwise\n\n3. Crying trains the breathing muscles even before they are born.\n\nThere are possibly other things I can't think of right now",
            "Controversial, but maybe to drive the father or other mates away, so that the baby has less chance of competition down the road.  Longer time the mother can dedicate her attention and resources to baby.",
            "To ensure their survival needs are met",
            "From this point of view it seems like motivation for the mother to care for the baby, so it won't cry and relay the location",
            "My uncle is an EMT and he says a crying baby is a healthy baby.",
            "Babies only inherent need is to receive love and touch from the parent, it\u2019s how they develop. They learn to cry to ask for that attention. They aren\u2019t developed enough to know that crying could bring danger",
            "It's not crying it's baby talk for give me titties and hugs and who the he'll is that man taking away the attention from me .",
            "Babies, since the beginning of time, have been plotting the death of their parents so they can play all day and eat ice cream for breakfast. One of those ploys is to gain the attention of a predator, in hopes they will hunt and eat their parents, solving all of their baby problems.",
            "It\u2019s also an awesome way to reveal your location to someone that can take care of you and let them know you need them for something",
            "I have a memory of watching a movie or a series, where there was a danger coming and a mother was holding her child but the child was crying and she suffocated it. She was crying, she didn't want to do ot but it was a live or dies situation. Can anyone remember the name of the movie/series?",
            "Because we are the apex predators and we can kill any predator coming to harm our offspring if we know they are there. Animals know exactly how extremely dangerous humans are and they are terrified of us. Consider also that we were even bigger and physically stronger long ago. Animals are not stupid, they know that if they hear a baby crying then we cannot be too far away and they will not be feeling very confident. The cries of a human baby actually scares the living shit out of carnivores as it alerts them that they are in our territory and their death could be imminent. They are more likely to wander into our territory when they aren't aware of it. It's better to hear us from a distance than to smell us when you're too close. \n\nJust remember that we are hunters and we bring death to animals far more than they bring death to us and they know it. We've never been sitting ducks.",
            "The loud crying scares predators away ever since Bam Bam was born.  Saber Tooth Tigers for instance learned that approaching a crying baby could result in a severe thrashing.  It\u2019s been that way ever since."

In the south parts of europe i can imagine people stay longer with their parents because the family values are different. I am from the north of Europe and my parents told my brother and me that by the time we were 22 y we should be moved out. Because they thought it is important to learn how to take care of your own and be independent. (But we were always welcome to come back to living with them if anything happened!)",

I've seen parents allow their kids to stay home and play video games and smoke all day. That isn't acceptable. \n\nHell. I'd be ok if they worked and used that money to see the world. But nothing is not ok.",
            "They don't.",
            "They don\u2019t. If you have friends that were kicked out at 18, they came from abusive, turbulent, or otherwise troubled homes, even if they wouldn\u2019t tell you or didn\u2019t realize it themselves. Their parents probably weren\u2019t ideal before they turned 18 either. \n\nThe majority of young Americans 18-24 live with their parents. If you dig deeper into the percentage of those that don\u2019t, you\u2019d probably find that a majority of those that don\u2019t live with their parents are probably in college, in the military, or married/living with a partner. The percentage of 25-35 year olds who live with parents is lower, but honestly not particularly low. \n\nHow America differs from much of the world is that rather than being socially unacceptable to move out unless you\u2019re married or highly financially successful, it\u2019s socially acceptable to move out *at any time* after the age of 18. Even if for no other reason than \u201cI don\u2019t like living with my parents.\u201d You aren\u2019t expected to be leashed to your parents\u2019 home, values, desires, and wishes into adulthood just because they gave birth to you. You aren\u2019t seen as an ungrateful wretch or a shameless whore for deciding you\u2019d like to live in a different city than your parents at 21 just because you\u2019re unmarried. You aren\u2019t required to put up with parental abuse or even just differences in values as an adult simply because they gave birth to you. You aren\u2019t required to cut your own goals and dreams down simply because your parents live here and your goals are over there. \n\nWe also don\u2019t expect parents to care for those who can work and earn their own life indefinitely. While the stereotype of anyone over 18 living with parents being a \u201closer\u201d is a complete lie, the idea of someone pushing 30 and living with their parents specifically because they don\u2019t feel they should work being childish or a leech is real, as is seeing those parents as indulgent or victimized. It\u2019s one thing to live at home while you work to save up or because housing costs are high, it\u2019s another to never intend to work indefinitely. Eventually your parents will retire, get old, and die. You should be capable of financing your own life and keeping your own home long before your parents grow old and die.\n\nThe social judgement I see from many Europeans, Asians, and Latin Americans directed at people who moved from their parents\u2019 house voluntarily \u201ctoo young\u201d is frankly extremely vicious and frequently downright abusive. I know \u201cAmerica bad\u201d is the cool hip neato attitude on the internet, but there are thousands of reasons people don\u2019t want to live with their parents or to financially carry a grown child that are not \u201cthey stopped caring\u201d or \u201cthey were kicked out.\u201d",
            "They want their lives back, lol\n\nI've never know anyone who was kicked out, but quite a few that couldn't wait to get out.",
            "In Asia, it's pretty normal to stay with your parents until you're ready to start your own family. If you're single, going solo usually happens when you really have to, like when your job is far away. So, it surprises me that in America, parents tend to kick out their kids at that age. I mean, it's not super young, but it's not quite old enough, and I think still need guidance",
            "Because they grew up in a time where living independently at 18 was a viable strategy, and think their kids also can. Or they are just bad people.",
            "There are truly some sad perspectives in this thread. As a parent, all I want is for my kids lives to be better then my own. How some parents wouldn\u2019t want that out of resentment is truly sad.",
            "I'm an American and a parent of 5 children, two of whom are 18 or older. They're both still living at home and will continue to do so as long as they need to. I don't actually know anyone who has kicked their children out at age 18. I do, however, know many children leave for college or the armed forces at that age - maybe the internet is skewing information, yet again!",

When he's ready, he'll fly away and have beaucoup cash.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy daughter went to college and never came home!",
            "They don't? They only people I know that left at 18 moved of their own accord due to going to college or because their parents were awful to live with. None were turned out.",
            "This is such a strange stereotype and definitely not a culturally accepted thing. I've heard multiple Europeans and Brits say this to me. The only people I know who have been kicked out by their parents had abusive dicks as parents well before 18, it was just illegal to abandon their kids before then. I've also unfortunately had friends from not the US have this happen to them, but I feel like there is more of a safety net in other countries for the kids.",
            "I know a couple of people who were kicked out at 18. Either the relationship between the parents and child was already terrible, or the parents simply saw them as adults and didn't want to parent anymore. In both instances, the relationship was more or less destroyed after. I know far more people who  wanted to get out at 18 because they had controlling parents and wanted freedom...\n\nPersonally, I didn't leave home until my late 20s. Financial issues stalled me from leaving, and honestly, my parents never forced my siblings or myself out. They actually like us, and we all get along very well. And staying home wasn't seen as bad or something to be ashamed of.  I often miss being around my family all the time now that I have my own place.",

            "I'm American and came from a family where I was told I had two choices when I turned 18: Go to college right away and be allowed to come home for summer vacation, or get a job and pay rent on my bedroom. First summer vacation I came home, parents told me they expected me to pay rent for the three months of summer to make up for the lost income they would experience from not renting out my bedroom while I lived there. They wanted $700 a month. I told them I didn't have an income and no place in town was going to hire and then train someone to work for only three months, they said too bad, look harder. Then my mother tried to sign me up for the knife pyramid scheme behind my back because she thought I could earn money that way. I decided to go back to my college town and get a job and apartment on my own.\n\nNeedless to say, I never came home for any vacation again and I'm now estranged from them. So the answer is that parents who do that are probably either greedy, mean spirited, or both.",

The general thing here in the United States is that historically we want our children to grow up to be adults before they reach the age that the government will force them to be one. \n\nToday's children in the United States rarely do chores proactively. In the many countries I visited in the Navy - I saw a much greater degree of early childhood education focusing on the importance of contributing to the family workload. The instance is probably high compared to other countries, of children forced to leave the home before they want to leave on their own, I think you'll find those countries that have a lower rate of this. Also have a higher rate of child participation and household responsibilities. \n\nBurdensome adult children are frequently asked to leave the nest - if not actively, encouraged (provided motivation) to do so for the sanity of their parents. Children that are a blessing to their parents often are encouraged to stick around and benefit from their good character.\n\nSome countries including Germany have a lower rate of adult children living at home than the U.S. https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/05/03/in-the-u-s-and-abroad-more-young-adults-are-living-with-their-parents/\n\nA great study on the subject can be downloaded from the link within that article.",

            "I propose sitting on your own voodoo doll would create a black hole. Sitting on your voodoo doll would cause your weight to be applied to yourself. Because you're on your voodoo doll, the weight will also be applied onto the voodoo doll _again_ then onto you again, then the voodoo doll, then you-  infinitely more. Idk much about physics but infinite weight onto a finite space sounds like it would create a black hole to me\n\nEdit: typos",
            "I suppose if we're seriously contemplating the vodoun nature of the question: no. But, anything that someone does to said doll happens to you, right? Mmmm, not quite. \n\nThe doll is supposed to be a parallel sympathetic link to the You who is alive and breathing--not a physical marionette. If that were true, we'd've harnessed these powers to launch people into space, safely. That would be a strange alternate universe, no? Instead, as I said, it's a sympathetic link. Think of it as a connection via your brain, rather than your body (it's meant as a spiritual connection). That's why when someone pricks the doll, the person who the doll is connected to will feel that pain in the area that was ganked. If they THREW that doll across the room, the body the doll is connected to won't feel the kinetic force of being *thrown*--they'll only feel the pain of hitting the *wall* (or floor, or wherever the kinetic energy comes to a sudden stop). \n\nSo. Let's say that person got ahold of their own voodoo doll. And, carelessly, forgot it was on a chair and sat on it. \n\nNothing would happen, because basically?They have their spirit back. \n\nThe link is more or less neutralized because the connection made through the doll was to your spirit--and what made the connection possible was through use of something that was once part of you. So if anything, sitting on the voodoo doll would destroy the connection between you and the doll, because it would deform or twist it so much that it no longer resembled you. \n\nNow, if someone ELSE sat on the doll...",

            ">If you sit on your own voodoo doll, can you ever get up again?\n\nYes, you'd be fine, and you would have no problem getting up again.  You'd feel no pain, no discomfort.\n\nMost other answers here are misunderstanding what a voodoo doll does.  They are trying to suggest that there is an actual physical connection between the doll and the subject of the doll, the person who the doll represents.  And therefore, whatever the doll experiences, the subject also experiences.\n\nThis is not how a voodoo doll works.\n\nThe doll isn't some New Orleans version of quantum entanglement.  It thrives instead on emotions.  The only thing that matters is spirit, and intent.  Anything you do accidentally to a voodoo doll doesn't evoke any change in the subject.  But even symbolic bad thoughts toward the doll can cause damage to the subject.\n\nThis principle is why a voodoo doll doesn't actually need to be damaged.  You can stick a pin in it's arm, and cause pain, and that pain is just the same whether it's a tiny pin, or cutting off the arm with scissors.  The point is the *intention* of the voodoo doll's holder.",

Depending on your strength, if you're able to move, which a normal person probs could cuz of the adrenaline I guess, then you can get your ass off the voodoo doll and have the extra weight disappeared instantly.\n\nedit : typos",
            "I am limited in  knowledge of voodoo and magic in general, but as I understand it, focus would be required to activate the doll. So if you accidentally sat on the doll, nothing should happen, as you were not actively casting a spell on the doll. Now if you sat on the doll, and focused your energy on the doll, you might feel yourself sitting on yourself, but you eventualy would stop focusing on yourself and then you could get up.",

            "Voodoo dolls, too my understanding, only inflict sensations. A classic example is when a Voodoo doll is poked with a needle you don't get a wound just the pain. So you'd feel the pain of someone of your weight sitting across your entire body but it wouldn't apply the actual weight just the pain. So you'd be able to stand up. Even if it apply the pressure of your weight on you, and you couldn't push it away, you could wiggle to the side until you're off the doll.",

            "Depends on how it's positioned\n\nIf you sit on the doll's butt, your weight would push you up from your butt, making you float right on top of the doll\n\nIf you sat on its lap, your weight would push you down, pushing down harder on the doll. This cycle would repeat infinitely, crushing you into whatever you sat on\n\nThe problem with this is that when you stab a voodoo doll, the person doesn't get stabbed, but get hurt less than the doll does. This would suggest that there's some reduction of force\n\nLet's say that if you apply force with magnitude x to the doll, the person experiences ax force (where 0<a<1)\n\nSay your weight is w and the doll adds x. I'll call the total force pushing you into your chair w+x, this would mean that x=a(w+x). From this you can calculate that w+x=w/(1-a), so if you can squat this much even for a tiny bit, you should be able to get up (you probably need even less squatting force as the more you push up, the less the doll pushes you down)",

            "I think it depends on how strong you are. In theory you'd experience your own weight on your lap, which if you could stand up with that amount of weight on your lap then you'd be ok, if not then it starts up a seemingly endless loop.\n\nThere are some questions though about what happens when you sit on a voodoo doll anyway. So if the doll is crushed, does that mean you're crushed? Or if the doll experiences the force of whatever you weigh, do you experience the force of whatever you weigh? It's possible you'd be crushed like the doll would, but not necessarily experience the weight. Like if a voodoo doll gets stabbed, you get a stab wound, but a knife doesn't materialize out of nowhere. This is probably up for debate too, but like the stab would you get isn't blocked temporarily like a stab with a knife would be if the knife was left in. So the more I think through it, I think you'd be crushed but not experience any weight on your actual person. So there would be nothing keeping  you from standing up, but your legs would be crushed so it'd be unlikely anyway.",

However, it started to feel frankly not great after a while. Best friend who does work in underserved communities said a good rule of thumb is to do the switcheroo. If something has a gendered opposite, can you use that just as easily? For example, would people be just as happy if you said \"girls\" or \"gals\" or even \"ladies\" to a mixed gender group?\n\nWhen I grew up people were losing their minds over switching from fireman to firefighter and policeman to police officer. It turned out those things really were just more inclusive and helped eliminate some subtle sexism.\n\nSo yeah, there's no PC police out there that's going to throw anyone in jail for using the term \"guys,\" but the reality is there really are a decent number of people who aren't comfortable with it so why not switch to the more inclusive y'all or folks or everyone?",

I really can\u2019t remember.  Anyway, I got completely stuck like right in the middle of the thing.  I was totally stuck and the more I struggled the more stuck I got, and I was very slowly sinking in.  At first I just tried to struggle out, but it became pretty clear that I was in trouble but I didn\u2019t even know what to do or how to call for help.  I think all the other kids were like yelling and playing, so probably nobody would have noticed if I started screaming unless I really went for it and shrieked like a maniac, but the problem didn\u2019t seem *that* urgent.  Plus I was kind of a weird kid and I was always screwing around, so I was afraid that no one would believe me if I started screaming, because everyone else was just running around in the mud and not being stuck.\n\nI don\u2019t remember who eventually pulled me out or even how they figured out that I was really in trouble, but I got down to like my chest and when I came out I had lost a shoe. \n\nI don\u2019t even know if that was quicksand or like a sinkhole or just some weird pressure thing that was sucking me in.",

I was invincible to the forces that be.....That was until I learned about quicksand. \n\nI still loved going to the beach. It was when I was standing at shore where the sand meets the crash of the waves. The waves begin to rush back pulling the sand with it. It feels like you\u2019re sinking but you\u2019re not. For while that was my favorite thing to do. But after learning about quick sand I had this feat that I would get sucked down under.\n\nWhat solidified not only that fear but also a new fear of water was when my uncle was fishing. He caught a fish which he ended laying it down into the sand. He had to grab a rag to properly pull it off the hook. It had spikes that he believed were poisonous. The fish dug itself under the sand. Us kids waited patiently and I didn\u2019t see the fish to begin with until I saw something moving in the sand. Wriggled gasping for air, spikes and all. It scared the bejeezus out of me that \n1. I couldn\u2019t trust the sand no more.\n2. I really didn\u2019t know what was in the ocean. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is then I was told that if you get stuck in the current you must not fight it. \nSo began another fear that I could eventually drift out to sea and never come back. \n\nNow that I\u2019m older Though can enjoy the beach once again. \n\nLong winded rant but; YES I agree with you!",

What do I do? I\u2019ve barricaded myself in a room with a lock and lacrosse stick.\n\nAbout an hour and 15 minutes ago I got a call from an unknown number and it was some guy with an Indian accent whispering about if I\u2019ve \u201cgotten my package\u201d. My dog is freaking out to. \n\nHow do I get out of this situation?\n\nEVERYONE THE SITUATION IS ALL TAKEN CARE OF\u2014\n\nShe left eventually and I\u2019m ok.

Anyways, thanks for the suggestions and help, I\u2019m ok.\n\nMore backstory i guess\u2014\n\nShe ordered a laptop when she was on vacation in Europe to our house and told my parents. So that we could like hold on to it when she\u2019s gone so it doesn\u2019t get stolen. She came over tonight and tried to get it from us between 8-10:30 pm without telling my family at all that she was coming. Anyways my family left for a party so I was home alone which leads me back to the original post and all that happened there. For those of you wondering why I didn\u2019t contact my parents, I did. It was one of the first things I did after heading upstairs and barricading myself in with a lacrosse stick. If you don\u2019t know much about lacrosse it hurts a lot to get hit with pads on so I assumed it must really hurt without them. They checked the cameras and couldn\u2019t really see much other than that there was a woman. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t go to the door. Eventually they tried talking to her through the cameras and it worked. If you\u2019re wondering why she did it or something, we don\u2019t know but we think they have a mental illness or something. Also, with the phone call, I have no idea what that is. I did order some DoorDash tacos that arrived about 20 minutes before the call. But they were delivered by \u201cAmy\u201d and not some middle aged sounding Indian guy. Anyways the guy was whispering and like \u201cdid you get your package\u2026 did you get your delivery\u201d. And then I asked what he meant and he just said \u201cyour package\u201d so I just hung up on the guy. Also I\u2019ve never gotten a call after getting DoorDash delivered. Honestly, it\u2019s probably not connected and I likely won\u2019t learn what was up with that call.\n\nI also was hesitant to communicate with her because my house is in an affluent area above the main part of my city and lots of people (mainly homeless and stuff because my city has an extreme homeless problem) try to come up here and get lucky through things like searching through trash cans, breaking into cars, robbing homes etc. I didn\u2019t want to risk anything like that so I decided staying out was the best option and I had the lacrosse stick if I really needed it.\n\nThe neighbors behind me claimed to receive my DoorDash order. I don\u2019t know anything about if they actually got a copy of it or something or if it wasn\u2019t actually for me. I mean I could\u2019ve gotten 2 orders of tacos\u2026 \n\nBut anyways, The situation is fixed. The woman went back to her house (laptop-less) and I\u2019m currently laying on the couch responding to all of the comments. Thanks everyone for your help and insightful comments.\n\nI survived the night as well \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAt this point I\u2019m basically just getting asked the same stuff over and over so I probably won\u2019t respond unless it\u2019s something new.

So that we could like hold on to it when she\u2019s gone so it doesn\u2019t get stolen. She came over tonight and tried to get it from us between 8-10:30 pm without telling my family at all that she was coming. Anyways my family left for a party so I was home alone which leads me back to the original post and all that happened there. For those of you wondering why I didn\u2019t contact my parents, I did. It was one of the first things I did after heading upstairs and barricading myself in with a lacrosse stick. If you don\u2019t know much about lacrosse it hurts a lot to get hit with pads on so I assumed it must really hurt without them. They checked the cameras and couldn\u2019t really see much other than that there was a woman. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t go to the door. Eventually they tried talking to her through the cameras and it worked. If you\u2019re wondering why she did it or something, we don\u2019t know but we think they have a mental illness or something. Also, with the phone call, I have no idea what that is. I did order some DoorDash tacos that arrived about 20 minutes before the call. But they were delivered by \u201cAmy\u201d and not some middle aged sounding Indian guy. Anyways the guy was whispering and like \u201cdid you get your package\u2026 did you get your delivery\u201d. And then I asked what he meant and he just said \u201cyour package\u201d so I just hung up on the guy. Also I\u2019ve never gotten a call after getting DoorDash delivered. Honestly, it\u2019s probably not connected and I likely won\u2019t learn what was up with that call. \n\nI also was hesitant to communicate with her because my house is in an affluent area above the main part of my city and lots of people (mainly homeless and stuff because my city has an extreme homeless problem) try to come up here and get lucky through things like searching through trash cans, breaking into cars, robbing homes etc. I didn\u2019t want to risk anything like that so I decided staying out was the best option and I had the lacrosse stick if I really needed it. \n\nBut anyways, \nThe situation is fixed. The woman went back to her house (laptop-less) and I\u2019m currently laying on the couch responding to all of the comments. Thanks everyone for your help and insightful comments.",

            "I grew up in a Jehovah's Witness household. I've been \"disfellowshipped\" for many years now. This means that any family who is still in the cult has to treat me as if I don't exist. Now, I am in my 40s, and this is the 2nd time this has happened (or more accurately, it's an extension of the first time). The first time was when I was 16, and I came out to my parents as an atheist. They kicked me out of the house, and I had to go live with a friend and his parents. I didn't speak to my parents again until I was 19 or 20. Over time, they tried to get me to go through the process of being accepted again (it's a whole big thing you have to go through). We were on speaking terms for years after I moved to the other side of the country, writing letters back and forth, and chatting on Facebook. Then my dad some incredibly racist shit and I called him out on it. I later received a message from my step-mom stating that they give up, and this is why I was DF'd in the first place, and that she regrets ever trying to \"turn me around\". Then they blocked me, and we haven't spoken since.\n\nThe sad part is that I had contemplated telling them I was atheist ever since I was about 14. I have no doubt they would have thrown me out on the streets at that age as well. \n\nMy parents are the reason I never had kids of my own. I just don't have a good model for parenthood and am afraid I'd be a miserable failure at it, and that breaks mt heart. I don't know how people's religious or political or other socially developed beliefs can override their basic mammal instinct to care for their young. I can't tell you how many sleepless nights I used to lay there wondering, \"*Even mass murderers have parents who care about them, so what the fuck is so wrong with me that mine don't?*\" \n\nI don't wonder anymore. They are as dead to me as I am to them. \n\nFor any parents out there, love your goddam kids. Hug them and tell them how much they mean to you. Do it often. Smother them with that shit.

Being the matriarch of the family, they tacitly followed suit and as a result my old man died quite sad because his beloved family wasn\u2019t there. In the time since he\u2019s been gone they\u2019ve all come back around to my mom begging to let the \u201cpast be in the past\u201d and all other kind of nonsense, but only one, my oldest then-aunt, apologized to mom and said that she just couldn\u2019t process the trauma of how he was fading away and siding with her mom made that easier.\n\nOut of sight, out of mind. I think people have the capacity for this more than they think, but social pressures keep people from treading into that territory. I think that\u2019s why it\u2019s important we continue to evaluate our relationships as we go in life to make sure we want to have them, and avoid leaving people, who come rely on us, out in the cold.",
            "If I can provide a perspective on this (I know it doesn't answer the question directly): I wished my parents would have disowned me. They were truly horrible, but they were attached to the idea of keeping me where they could control me. I grew up with a narcissistic and emotionally abusive mother, and a pushover of a father who would back her up in every scenario. I wanted most of all to flee, but due to unique circumstances, it wasn't a wise choice unless my parents officially disowned me. Without their formal disownment (or whatever the legal name for it is where I'm from) I couldn't access government support (as it is assumed my parents would be supporting me) and it meant I suffered in their house for far longer than I should have. I'm doing better now, and have learned to cope with the way they are most of the time, but I will soon be in a position to flee without needing their disownment. You bet I'm running as fast as I can. \n\nI never was kicked out, but the extreme reverse of disownment can be just as horrible. \n\nMy experiences however, don't take away from the fact that there are thousands of people being disowned from their families against the child's will. I may never understand why parents kick out their children when the children aren't ready, and I believe it is a truly immature and selfish act.",

A friends parents invited me to live with them and I accepted. \n\nLiving in their home I got a chance to see what living in a stable household with a kind and caring family was like. That turned my life around. After I graduated high school I went on to college and became the first person in my family to earn a college degree. I now have a successful career, I\u2019m happily married, and have a child of my own. \n\nI have no doubt that if it were not for that family taking me in I would either be in prison or dead from a drug overdose.

I\u2019m 43 now and I have never forgotten what they did for me and I\u2019m so grateful. Fortunately, I\u2019ve been able to express that gratitude multiple times and thank them for all they did for me. I still tear up thinking about it. \n\nI\u2019m a father now and NOTHING my child would do would cause me to disown her or kick her out of our home.

            "I have an older brother and an older sister. Our mother was... I dunno what the truest medical definition would be. Paranoid, delusional, nutjob?  \nThroughout our childhood she would think one or all of us kids were conspiring against her, so she would kick us out. The first time I was kicked out of the house, I was in the 5th grade. Being the youngest and seeing this previously happen to my brother and sister, I already had a plan. I spoke with my best friend's parents (who knew my mom was nuts) and asked when it happened to me if I could live with them. When I asked them, I was in the 3rd grade. I remember my friend's mom crying as she said yes. I thought she was crying because she didn't want me but felt obligated.  \nAnyway, our mom would kick us out. Then, after a week or month, she would just show up after school and pick us up and we were supposed to pretend nothing had happened. Just go back and be happy and cheerful. We knew if we didn't, we would either get kicked out again or beat.  \nOnce home we would have new toys (because she threw all our old ones away) or she would schedule a family picture photoshoot (because she burned all our baby pictures). Or we would go to the dog pound to get a new dog.  \nI eventually left all that behind and walked away from her.  \nBut the old saying is true: We end up marrying our mothers....  \nIt's weird how we normalize abuse and feel unloved once it's gone.",

Same goes for the reverse of that scenario.\n\nBut for a parent to kick out and disown a child that is still not a legal adult and is totally dependent on them? That is wrong and parents like that are automatically abusive in my eyes - if there was a real reason that they can't care for the child any more, then they can properly seek help or give up custody to another family member if need be.

            "Another disowned \u201ckid\u201d here [28 now]. \n\nMy parents divorced when I was 4 and had joint custody. They soon remarried and my mother had 6 more children and two step children. Ultimately I was abandoned by her at age 10 (she moved away and I haven\u2019t seen or heard from her since) leaving me to live with my father and stepmom. \n\nBoth were severely physically and emotionally abusive to me over the next few years and my stepmother being diagnosed with severe bipolar, personality disorder, and other things. \n\nI was removed from the home at the age of 14 by CPS and lived with a few different friends over the following year until I was declared a ward of the state. \n\nMy very religious (Mormon) aunt and uncle took guardianship of me at age 15. I graduated high school at 17 and moved off to college (I was lucky enough to get accepted to inexpensive schools). \n\nA few years later, my aunt and uncle also disowned me because of my decision to leave the religion they taught me and I haven\u2019t really heard from them since. \n\nFrom my perspective, it\u2019s been easy to blame myself for all of these experiences because I am clearly a common denominator in each one. I was not a perfect child nor a perfect teenager, but I would say that I never did or said anything \u201cdisown-worthy\u201d. \n\nAs the years have passed, it\u2019s been easier to see my parents, aunt and uncle as just people with everyday problems just like anyone else, but I think what lead to their definitive decisions as they concerned me was their inability to face problems and challenges well. \n\nNowadays, it\u2019s so much more common (and perhaps easier for the mind) to cancel someone based on one or two things that they\u2019ve said or done and I think that\u2019s how these adults in my life deal with many of their day-to-day problems on a regular basis, not just when it came to me. \n\nIf you\u2019ve stuck with me this long in reading, I appreciate it. \n\nI hope that one day less people will deal with difficult things in this manner because it has a pretty detrimental effect on those who are cancelled, abandoned, or pushed out of the mind.",

I can't really speak with any authority on modern ideas about it, but there is a type of thinking about parenting which in Northern Europe becomes noticeable from the 1830's onward and may begin to explain where it comes from. \n\nIt insists that it is the parent's responsibility to systematically \"discipline\" their children, for the good of nation's general morale and strength, suggesting that an \"undisciplined\" population will degenerate over the course of generations, to eventually \"fall\" and be replaced. With the stakes set this high, the field was prepared for some pretty awful abusive parenting.\n\nA new genre of middle class parenting manuals focused on training children in self control through various systems of \"dispassionate\" and consistently applied punishments, among which was deliberately withholding signs of love, compassion and recognition, using love as a tool of emotional coercion. I've noticed the word \"discipline\" in US English seems to be used as a verb, a euphemism for punishment, which may mean someone's still teaching American parents to think along these lines. They may be convinced that what \"seems\" cruel now is really \"for their own good\" in the long run.",

            "First off, that's really terrible, and good on you for taking care of him.  While I know it's a bit of a different situation, I have a bit of a story that made me realize how a parent could disown a child.\n\nAbout 7 years ago, my (now ex) wife cheated on me with one of my good friends.  He was an incredibly selfish person, but he was the \"golden child\" in his parents eyes.  They supported him no matter what - he could do no wrong.  \n\nSo after I found out what had happened, I was pissed.  He sent me a text after he found out I knew, saying \"this was going to be an incredible summer, and he hoped that I wouldn't let this ruin it for all our friends\"  I never responded, and have not talked to him since.  My ex-wife and I decided we wanted to work on our marriage, and so she told him that they couldn't talk anymore.  Despite this, he kept texting and trying to call her, so she ended up blocking his number.  It got to the point where he started calling her at work, which lead to her quitting her job (which didn't help our marriage).  \n\nHe kept showing up at our baseball league, golf outings etc., despite being told he shouldn't come by mutual friends.  And this happened time and time again, until most of our close shared friends stopped talking to him - including his best friend from childhood. (I didn't ask them to do this, but I think they realized he was a shitty person).  And about a year after all of this, he sent me a letter, with a small apology (he hadn't apologized up to this point), and with a larger section about how he \"forgave me for tearing our friends apart\".  I don't know why I read it, I should've just thrown it away.\n\nIt didn't surprise me much when a few weeks after our friends stopped talking to him, his dad gave a sermon in our church (he was not a pastor, he just felt \"moved\" to share a message) and basically was saying that when you go through a hard time in your life, and your friends stop talking to you, you find out who your real friends are, and that those people are terrible people.\n\nSo I guess for myself, I don't know if I'd be able to disown my child.  But after seeing that, if they are an adult child who does something that hurts people deeply, and they have no remorse, and keep acting the same way, I can see how I could get to that point.",

Most children need about 5 marbles to be happy. \nSome kids need 4, some need 8, but most parents carry around 10, so it isn't a problem. \n\nSome parents tough are 3 marble parents, and if you (the child) need more than 3, they literally don't have any more to give. \n\nThey aren't withholding it from you, they just don't have it. It doesn't matter what you do, or how you change, they will never be able to give what they don't have. \n\nUnfortunately for your student, his parents are one of those 3 marble parents, and he will have to understand that he will have to choose between accepting conditional love from his parents, or look for his right fit elsewhere. \n\nThe saying goes \"the blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb\"\n\nThis is a crappy situation, and he should be talking to a counselor, and it is really nice of you to care that much.  \n\nBest of luck to all of you",

How can people not care about what their streets and neighborhood looks like\"\n\nThis analogy is sort of how you may be processing this. You are a good person who understands what it means to love your kids but not everyone has the same value. \n\nI think we all assume that everyone sees the world the same way we do and has the same values we do. We assume that because something seems wrong that everyone thinks the same way. Some people have their own value system and there are things more important. \n\nSome parents love their religion more than they love their kids. If their religion says that being gay is a sin (for example) and it is an abhorrent sin at that, some parents find \"honoring God\" a higher priority than doing right by their children and will disown them. \n\nMost of the time it is also a social thing. The parent worries about how ones life decisions will make THEM look to the world. They don't care about whether it is harmful, who the kid really is, etc. It could be as simple as marrying someone outside of your race. Their \"image\" is more valuable than their kids. \n\n\nIt is almost always selfish. I am sure that there are probably good excuses to disown a kid like if you learn that they were a child serial killer but in general, like 99.9999% of the time these events are usually selfish.",

            "There's a biblical reason that many use as well.\n\nIn the Bible there is a verse that talks about being \"unequally yoked\" with non-believers or sinners (many believe that it is a \"sin\" to be born LGBT). It instructs people to not be in relationships with those people but to reach out to them with Christianity in case they want to follow it. Jesus also said \"if your eye offends you pluck it out\". This is an instruction that \"whatever causes you to falter in your belief in god should be shunned\".\n\nIn the Bible, it has several verses saying to execute gay people. The new testament writers say things that are interpreted to mean that God sends all LGBT people to hell. \n\nFrom their perspective: they are doing gods will. They believe God hates their kid and will send him to burn in hell forever when he dies. They're not allowed to be \"unequally yoked\" with him so the only \"\"\"Christian\"\"\" thing to do is to cut him out of their lives. Then, they will never think about \"wait that's my SON I just disowned\" because then they can just forget he existed. \n\nSource: I was once an Evangelical who cheered people who disowned their gay kids. This is similar reasoning for why Jehovah's Witnesses \"disfellowship\" nonbeliever family members and friends.",

            "I'm a mental health therapist, and the important thing to keep in mind is that people parent how they were parented. The extent to which they were loved as a child sets the pattern for their future relationships (in the absence of some intervention). Parents who can't handle their children's failures (however they define \"failure\" - we may not see it as a failure, but they do) likely learned at a young age that their own worth as a human was based on how perfectly they met expectations. Often, that kind of upbringing is impossible to just \"let go\" unless you do the hard work of dealing with it (plus it can manifest in some personality disorders). It's easier to brush it under the rug. But then your children's flaws/differences/whatever are triggering, and you desperately push them away because you yourself were rejected if you were less than perfect. Again, I'm not saying that being gay is a flaw, but obviously that's the parents' view in this situation. \nThis doesn't in any way excuse disowning one's child. It just helps to remember. We can't show unconditional love if no one ever shows us that we are loved unconditionally.",
            "It's a thing of the past that gets passed down. Their parents did it to them or another close relative so they think it's something they can do as well. In example, my grandmother was disowned by her family for marrying my black grandfather. Years later when I came forward regarding being sexually abused by my uncle, husband of her favorite daughter, she left me a voicemail telling me that I was no longer part of the family and not to bother trying to contact her or her new husband. My mother later kinda did the same thing after I expressed my disappointment in her staying with a man who left my siblings to starve. I won't disown my son no matter what, he's autistic and will need me as long as I live and I am okay with that. People make crappy choices but it's because there is something wrong with them that they need to work out. We are all multifaceted, and are never one thing, we make bad decisions but we can always choose to change as long as we still draw breath. I say this so folks don't go on to hate and resentment, chalk it up to them making a crappy choice and choose the family you want in life, it's what I did.

            "All the answer seems to be the very unhelpful \"because they're bad people.\"  I don't agree (in some cases.)\n\ndisclaimer: I disagree with the disownment both in this case, and as a punishment in general.  Just explaining the thought process as you asked.\n\nFirst of all, I don't believe you that you would still visit and love your child if they were a cold blooded murderer.  It's a really hard thing to understand and predict.  It's the empty virtue signaling like \"if someone broke into my house I'd fight back/shoot them\".  How do you know?  Most people that say that are wrong.\n\nThink of the actual reasons the kids are being disowned.  Remember, this isn't simply \"parents kick child out of home.\"  They had a reason, and in this case it's that the child is gay.  To many this isn't simply some innocent fact, it's a moral sin.  The child is a corrupt being, and allowing it to continue and letting it stay in their home itself is a sin.\n\nThen there's the fact that they believe it's a choice.  It's not like the kid had red hair (abominations (sarcasm)), they think the kid is choosing to be a vile sinner.  Disowning is not only punishment for their actions, but also incentive for them to change.  If they repent and go straight then they could come home.\n\nThe parents don't think they're monsters, they think they are doing what is best for the child.  Force them to come to terms with their faults and bad actions and become better people.  Even if it's the hardest thing they've ever had to do.  They can still love the child, but believe that they must do it *because* it is what is best for the child.",

They didn\u2019t feel safe having him in their home - especially around the younger kids who weren\u2019t and still aren\u2019t a problem at all. Even though they had to have been traumatized, they don\u2019t act at all like their older brother did. Sometimes there\u2019s a \u201cbad seed\u201d for whatever reason and if parents need them out of the house for their own safety and the safety of their other children, I can completely understand.

            "There isn't one solid answer to this question because it all depends on situational context, though I can add onto some of the comments I cannot list out all examples and reasons why. \n\nOne of the most common reasons in the American sense of disowning ones child is that due to the actions, beliefs or the way the kid is, takes away the ability to live vicariously through what they see is a little version of themselves, they do not feel that the child will heave all of the accomplishments in life they have set out for them and expect more, they believe their expectations cannot be met and therefore save themselves the future disappointment that goes along with that without accounting for the selfishness that action entails. \n\nAnother reason is that they're battling with their beliefs, there is still a heavy religious population within the USA to this day and if a child comes out as gay (such as in the case you have provided) although it just follows by the biblical translations of the time without accounting historical context within the original language of the Bible, they've been accustomed to the idea that homosexuality is a sin and as such need to have an internal battle with their beliefs, the parents will likely bicker and argue until some kind of existential crisis follows which can lead to the breaking point of their relationship, usually this is the case when the child is welcomed back at some point with open arms. \n\nAside from discussing honor, reputation or slander that's all I can muster in terms of reasons as to why one would be disowned by their parents, the siblings will likely disagree with their decision which willl lead to more hostility in the home. If the latter is the case here then temporarily disowning the child may actually save their spirit in the sense that they're not involved with the turmoil of the divided household. My advice is to reassure them that this move can benefit them by allowing them to live their lives and explore themselves earlier than initially imagined, their folks might come back around but if they don't the kid is better off because their values will not be hindered or broken down. A quick release in emancipation 2 years early is better than 2 years of their parents hating and trying to change who they are. I wish the best of luck to you and the kid you're helping, you're doing a good service and you have a kind soul.",

            " Yes, they do. Workplace bullying and harassment is common. Though usually it isn't direct threats, violence or insults like it is in high school. Rather, it's people passive-aggressively insulting others, using positions of power to get what they want, or simply being intentionally difficult to create a hostile work environment in which the bully feels in control.",
            "Yes- but it\u2019s called \u201coffice politics\u201d when you get older and it\u2019s usually thinly veiled passive aggressive BS.",

I'm an older woman that DMs a lot of RPGs I used to DM public games at local gaming stores and while the vast majority of players were great, every so often some guy (it was always a guy) would just try to bully and intimidate me.   Luckily I had good back up from the regulars at my table so I wasn't alone and it would be shot down pretty damn fast and the bullies rarely came back for a second session.    But watching guys try to use their size and loom to intimidate me into let them do some rules breaking shit in a game was very weird.  Like dude it's a freaking D&D game, you failed the roll calm your tits.   Oh and the ones that would never let me check that they rolled  and would yell at me for daring to doubt their word as they swept up their dice claiming yet another crit, calling me a fat bitch doesn't change the fact you're cheating asshole.",

            "Yes and in a lot of ways it's almost worse. Speaking from a female point of view since that's what I am. The women at my first job didn't like me because I worked hard, got my shit done, and I he regulars loved me. I was considered for a promotion so at 6am in a coffee shop, I was the only person up front with a line to the door. Went into the back to find someone and couldn't find anyone to help so I was taking orders, making coffee, getting donuts, and making food. People in line are pissed that I'm the only one up front. Most were nice to me but a couple weren't. About half an hour later someone came up to help. Found out later that all 5 of them were in the managers office making something up about me cussing at a customer to write me up and watch me struggle alone on the security cameras. Manager wasn't there so when she got in I found out I got written up and denied it. She checked the cameras and the write up was torn up because it was bs. I had to move stores because the bullying was so bad. New manager went to the old store to get my write ups and when he brought them to the store he tore them up, threw them in the trash and had me take out the trash. I've had a lot of awful coworkers, all of them women who were petty and spiteful because they worked at a dunkin donuts or another shitty job after they peaked in high school. I'm now a software tester with an amazing company and I wouldn't leave if someone doubled my salary because a good team is so hard to find. When you find a job that you love with good people, stay loyal. It's not worth it to leave for more money and deal with more terrible people.",
            "High school is just where bullies start out, buddy.",
            "Yeah, 100%. Part of growing up is learning how to deal with or ignore bullies and the words they say. My wife's brother is toxic and quite a bully. Always telling people that they aren't as manly as him and whatnot, judging all my kids for not doing typical guy things, and talking about how kids were raised in \"the good old days\", and expecting people to be thankful that he's around. Everyone pretty much just ignore him by now though.",
            "I think in adulthood a lot of bullying gets more subtle. Bullies often fail to grow out of it, but lots of them learn to do it in ways that aren't obvious and make it hard to call them out for it. There are some that still do it in obvious, childish ways like threats and name-calling, but I think there's more than just learn to passively belittle and gaslight others in a way that lets them get away with it more often.",
            "Yes.  I had an aunt that bullied me up until I was 30.  One day after telling me I looked like I have leprosy (I have lichen planus-an inflammatory disease) I looked at her and said in the most sympathetic voice \u201c Dam, you must be really unhappy with your life\u201d and meant it. After that she stopped bullying me.",

            "Yes absolutely in the corporate job world. I see quiet people get bullied because they don\u2019t talk enough, I see people of different races get bullied because they look different, I see people of different cultural backgrounds get bullied because their cultural norms are \u201cweird,\u201d and on and on.\n\nAs someone who was bullied in high school and in the corporate world, I\u2019ve worked a lot to build myself up to combat bullying in the workplace. I also try to build others up by motivating them to stand up for themselves\u2014and do my part to stand up with them\u2014in bullying situations. It\u2019s become my side-passion really. I hate seeing people pushed around in the workplace and I will ~~destroy someone~~ take the opportunity to facilitate a teachable moment if I see someone intentionally or unintentionally being a bully.",
            "Strive to be called \"the quiet one\" in an office. There's inevitably bullshit and gossiping going on pretty much all the time. I found the best strategy was just to refuse to engage past short, polite conversation. I did not make \"work friends\". Then they eventually have nothing to say other than \"she's quiet\".",
            "Definitely the bully keeps on keeping on.  Or they try.     \n\nI had one at my very first real job.  I was young so I just put her in a box in my mind and ignored her and her behavior.  If that situation would to happen now when I am decades older, I would have shut that down immediately.  The best way to deal with a bully is to shut it down at the first sign.  We are both females.       \n\nOn a side note, she ended up having to leave because she had an affair with the married production manager.  She had wanted my job and wasn't qualified.  I was hired and was an ass to me.       \n\nI learned a lot at that job and I am glad I took it.  Never let the bastards stop you from improving yourself.  They always exist and always will.       \n\nHad a bully at our local redneck club in the midwest.  We have a group FB page and when Covid started she posted to everyone Not to tell anyone outside the club about any covid infections inside-  she made a remark that those people have no friends.  It took less than a year for her and her husband to get covid and the current president of the club is in the hospital.  I havent been there since 2019.",
            "Depends how good HR and management is at their job. If you allow the leeway for people to stomp on others someone is going to take it.\n\nSometimes HR and management actually ARE the bullies :) Imagine your teachers being your school bullies. It's not great.\n\nBig difference is you can't change schools of your own accord but you can change jobs. The bullies are also often relying on you so you have leverage.\n\nThen there's the rabbit hole of whether you can get that leverage. Are you making life decisions that put yourself in a position where you cannot give up your job for another. I have never done that. I'm always happy to move for work if it's shitty. No dependents, no debt, I enjoy getting out of my box and moving (I moved half way around the world for a change). That may all change as I'm getting older. < EDIT\n\nMy experience in retail scarred me for life. Fuck you Target Australia. The whole chain is built on bullying from top to bottom. Same with a lot of big box stores...",
            "Yes, and it happens a lot. But in a sense that you won't be able to call them out. Your only option will be to look for another job. \n\nSome people just suck and we have to deal with that somehow.",
            "Yeah. It can be surprisingly easy to become a scapegoat and oftentimes people use collective derision to find commonality with one another.\n\nI used to go with a girl who, despite being the boss, was bullied, possibly for not being assertive enough. It was mostly insubordination and offhand comments and it actually made.her quit the job. She suffers from Depression so that was undoubtedly a factor but I've seen similar behaviour a lot over the years.",
            "Yes. Workplace bullying. It's literally like being back at school.",
            "YES.  People get bullied at work too.  My husband had two women (the owner\u2019s wife and manager) bully him at work.  One day he snapped and said some stuff on Facebook (he didn\u2019t name names or the business name but if you knew it was obviously them he was talking about).  They fired him. \n\nThose women bully others.  \n\nI find women are more often the bullies although some males are mean jerks.",
            "Definitely do. My mum (50) has just recently quit her job at a private boarding school because of it. For years her Line Manager has been bullying her. My mum is French so LM would always always ask her to repeat what she said and make fun of her accent, but never when anyone was around. She would agree to things face to face, mum would carry it out and then LM would berate her by email adding the principal and vice principal in copy. Just constantly undermining her. She once sat in on one of my mums lessons to assess her. A psychology lesson. She gave mum a 0, \u201cno evidence of knowledge of her subject\u201d. She was assessing her French teaching skills.. she couldn\u2019t admit she showed up to the wrong lesson. Of course my mum didn\u2019t demonstrate any French teaching skills as she taught psychology in English. And her LM straight up failed her instead of admitting her mistake. My mum is French and still has the accent so it\u2019s just so stupid. Mum is also diabetic so needs to have insulin in the staff room fridge on hand. LM would constantly remove it saying it wasn\u2019t safe. It was in a clearly labelled sealed box and no one would accidentally take it. They\u2019re in tubes for injection so not like anyone would mistake it for food. \n\nPrincipal and even other teachers never believed her so she eventually quit after suffering from depression and becoming so stressed that she started bleeding from various areas. Now her LM has moved on to bullying another teacher who says she is thinking of leaving and apologised to my mum for never believing her. \n\nMum said the principal and vice principal act the same a fair bit too. Twisting what teachers have said or withholding information. And that it\u2019s quite common in schools. Some people start out as teachers and may get a power high from controlling the students. And if they work their way up into management then they act like assholes to the staff below them as they truly believe they are superior and have some sort of power complex and end up bullying them.",

            "Yeah, unfortunately.\n\nI was never bullied in school, but one of my first jobs there was a manager that would cycle through employees to bully until they eventually quit. And then she finally got to me. At the time I was undiagnosed and not on medication, so she made life a living hell for me.\n\nThere wasn't anything I could do to fight back, the corporation I worked for had the Always Believe Managers policy, so it was her word against mine. \n\nSmall upside is that after I left, my friend, who was still working there, told me the manager got her ass fired for all the theft she had been committing for years:)",
            "Yup. Currently getting bullied by my supervisor. If it wasn\u2019t because the money was good I would\u2019ve quit a long time ago.",
            "Most of the bosses I've had have been bullies. My boss right now loves to pick out a coworker of mine to yell at whenever she does something he doesn't like (even if everyone else does it too).",
            "Yep. In some places its exactly like high school. The difference is now your bully can be twice your age and you're left wondering how someone never grew out of that crappy mentality. Not all places are like this though and you'll meet your fair share of good and bad. Just try and leave the bad as quickly as possible.",
            "I'm gonna go against the grain and say it's nowhere even close to middle/high school levels. It's much, MUCH less common, and easier to handle if it happens because people recognize you're an adult with agency. \n\nI'm kind of surprised to see so many people say the opposite. It's was a night and day difference for me comparing the two. And I've worked at 3-4 different places.",
            "I was bullied in my late 20s by my partner at the time\u2019s ex girlfriend. She said awful things about me behind my back, tried to turn my friends and my own sister against me, would even punch me in the stomach at shows (we were involved in the same music scene). It didn\u2019t really change until she left town. Then my partner bullied me, though at that point it\u2019s just called abuse.",
            "Not only does it continue, in my experience it gets even worse especially when working first jobs right out of highschool / college. From what I've seen, the people who were bullies in school, become bosses and managers afterwards because they are willing to treat people poorly. \n\nThis behavior almost vanished once in the professional world though.",
            "Yes, it is called mobbing.",
            "I was never really bullied at school, I was bullied by an ex boyfriends best friend which was horrendous but the worst bullying was by people at my first job.\n\nThey were all women and all at least 4-5 years older than me, one was twice my age and she was one of the worst. No real reason for the bullying except that I was young and pretty naive. I did nothing to incite the bullying whatsoever but I realised that some people just seem to want someone to pick on to make themselves feel better.",
            "Yep! I've been bullied at workplaces, in friend groups. Work places are especially bad because like school, it's a bunch of people who were put together, and didn't choose to be together. Managers tend to not care, and adults can be a lot sneakier than teenagers.",

            "Yep, I was bullied by a coworker for 3 years...I'm his boss now. Karma is a bitch \ud83d\ude43",
            "Yes, like others have said, at work. The difference is, when you're in school  you're stuck with that person. As an adult, you can quit and find somewhere else to work.\n\nThis is why I think parents forget what it was like to be bullied. They seem to think it'll go away on it's own. It never does. The forget because they can just quit. School  doesn't work that way.",
            "Yep absolutely it does.  Having been a victim of it myself... and the cause of a pretty scary depressive episode.  In my workplace it usually happened (note the past tense) when new people came into the office.  It was a select, toxic group of people who did this, one of them being a low level boss, and of course one of our shop stewards.  Usually it started off with them \u201chelping\u201d the newbie, and then it turns downright ugly within the first few weeks of the new person being there.  I will always remember when that low level boss turned around and told me to my face, \u201cyou know we talk about you behind your back?\u201d\n\nThankfully at that point I had gotten help and was put on meds (also found out around that time I most likely have ADHD), and had learnt to somewhat stand up for myself.  By then I had the ability to \u201ctalk back\u201d to that boss and told them that of course I knew, but I didn\u2019t really care - and at that point I was thankfully telling the truth. \n\nDue to management changes around that time as well, that low level boss \u201cdecided\u201d to retire not long after our \u201cconversation\u201d, when she was actually forced to do her job... and the other toxic group of bullies eventually left for other departments once there was actually structure and they couldn\u2019t get away with as much of that shit anymore. \n\nSince then I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to earn a promotion at that same department where I train part time, along with my normal full time duties.  Now it\u2019s within my power to make sure that nobody in my office is ever made to feel like I was. \n\nI\u2019ve also learnt along the way that the concept of \u201cbullies don\u2019t know they are being rude/bullying\u201d is bullshit.  They abso-fucking-lutely know what they are doing. Maybe they\u2019ve had shitty lives themselves to where they feel the only way they\u2019re in control of something is to make someone else miserable.  \n\nIf you are this type of person reading this now (yes I realize most people won\u2019t admit this even to themselves), all you are doing is continuing the shitty person cycle.  Nothing is ever a good enough excuse to purposefully put someone down and make them feel worthless.  Be a better person.  Be the one to break out of that cycle. \n\nAnyways, if you\u2019ve made it to the end thanks for listening to my long rambling story/answer to your question. Hope you have a great day, and great question!",

Eventually another employee snapped and lost it on him. The whole thing blew up and he was forced to take a step back but he was still a dick. I ended up moving up in the company and this supervisor moved on. Eventually I actually took over the supervisor position. He ended up losing his job at the company he had went too and asked for his job back. Sweet poetic justice when my superintendent told him that I had already secured the job and that they wouldn't need him. Now that Im in my current position I try to remember every day that I am not a bully. Its not my way or the highway. I never want to make anyone feel small or unheard. Yes, it can be tough to balance holding people accountable and being compassionate but its worth effort. Id rather live my life with scruples than turn into someone I despise.",
            "Yes, I have been bullied for being the only male in an office of females, majority rules and I would often be made fun of or pointed out to be an example of a weak man around powerful women, I occupy the lowest paid position in the office, it was justified to me as \"well at least now a man knows what sexism is like.\" People would steer the conversation so it would be all about how men are terrible when I was the only man at the table, I just wouldn't react, or the conversation would be held in ways to try to bait me into expressing an opinion on things \"only a woman can have an opinion on.\". Otherwise a manager bullied me for being competent at my job, I suppose they must have felt threatened and again, I think it was a number of other things, they bullied at least three people out of that department and when I reported it to their boss, I was blamed (always use official channels like HR, don't give bullies a chance, they don't deserve it, even if you are a kind person sometimes the best thing for people like that is to be confronted beyond the point where they can use the social dynamics to escape, it's best not to take it on yourself as well and bosses will have loyalty to managers more than the workers beneath them). I work in a government department that prides itself on its values, honesty isn't one of them and respect  and empathy are, just self deceiving I guess.",
            "Here is a tip, most adults act the same way they did in high school.",
            "If you have a victim aura, you'll be bullied wherever you go. I did. I was bullied at work, by so-called friends, by my landlady...\n\nTherapy and meditation changed all that. I'm confident now, which means bullies don't come around.",
            "They can.\n\nIt tends to be less common, since most people have learned to get along with people/not to be quite so much of a blatant asshole by the time they\u2019re an adult doing things on their own...but some people never learn this, and those people will keep trying the same petty bully shit that used to work at school.",
            "Oh absolutely. I worked at a machine shop that was extremely \"clique-y\". There were two guys that sort of ran the show on the floor- if you weren't friends with them, they would talk shit about you constantly and make your life hell- then be nice to your face, acting all innocent. The shop morale was crap because of these guys and their followers.\n\nThing is, management even hated them too but wouldn't do anything finite about it because they were extremely good at their job, whereby generating the most profit for the company.\n\nI peaced out of that job as soon as I could. Was super highschool-esque.",
            "I lived with a very small womanast year that bullied me. Loud, messy, rude. And everything wrong was my fault. Never felt bullied all my life until those 15 months living with her.  \n\nIt definitely can happen.",
            "100% yes\n\nBut with me personally, I feel like it\u2019s less \u201cbullying\u201c and more \u201ca mutual agreement that we hate being with each other, and the occasional snapping is understandable\u201d\n\nBut gossip? Way worse",
            "Yes. However, it\u2019s often easier to stand up to them and easier to leave the situation (eg quit your job, move out from your toxic roommate)",
            "Yes. And peer pressure. A bunch of years ago, my ex-husband's uncle was kind of toying with the idea of drinking alcohol out loud at a family party (he never drank and it was late, after everyone else was drunk already). MIL (and to a lesser extent FIL) started out trying to be \"supportive\" of this decision and it quickly turned into them pressuring him when he was obviously very apprehensive. I said something about peer pressure being bad and they were very obliviously like \"who is peer pressuring\" and I very bluntly told them \"you are!\".",
            "I\u2019ve had some bad bosses, but wouldn\u2019t call it bullying. Ex GF though was group bullied by a few of her co workers everyday. She constantly would cry about it as she reported it but it never stopped. It was a very toxic work environment.\n\nThe thing is when people are kids they are not aware of what they are doing and are a product of their environment. However, when we all reach adulthood we have a choice, and unfortunately there are some who choose to stay cruel/mean instead of dealing with their insecurities like a grown ass adult should.",
            "At a place I worked in the shop there were two Hispanic guys that were talking about and making fun of 2 other guys in Spanish. They made it super obvious by looking directly at them and then starting to laugh. So that\u2019s one kind of \u201cbullying\u201d. The 2 white guys then get pissed off and say \u201cthis is America speak English\u201d so there\u2019s another type of \u201cbullying\u201d. The Hispanic guys go to the bosses and throw a huge fit about what the guys said and accused them of being racist. So that\u2019s another type of \u201cbullying\u201d.  The bosses then have a company meeting about the incident and threaten to fire anyone saying racist things which could kinda be considered bullying. After the incident I went to the bosses to let them know that the two Hispanic guys where straight up saying super racist, Things about the white guys out loud but no one could understand them except me another Hispanic guy. To my knowledge the Hispanic guys were never confronted about that.",
            "A lot of women bully younger women. In the NHS and charities it is very common. Both my daughters were bullied by women when they worked in supermarkets after leaving school. Women have tried without success to bully my wife. I have seen relatively little male on male bullying.",
            "Was bullied by a group of women at work (in their 20's/30's/40's) which went completely unchecked by the manager. Was verbally attacked by the ring-leader at a team meeting (for lack of productivity) as the others kept quiet, had to defend myself calmly by saying these type of discussions should be private between two people.\nThe ones who kept quiet were ashamed of what was happening, as they had made it clear to other team members (but not me) The ring leader ended up crying her eyes out in the pub a few weeks later and after a few drinks attempted to cheat on her husband with another co-worker. I left that awful job to go travelling soon after. \n\nSo yeah, that nonsense never really goes away unfortunately.",
            "Happens on social media everyday. I\u2019d challenge you to find a front page Reddit thread that doesn\u2019t provide dozens of examples.",
            "To bring a bit more nuance than some of posts I\u2019m reading here, you rarely see the same kind of open bullying with adults as you see in high school.\n\nThere\u2019s a couple factors:\n- As an adult, you get more agency about what you do, where you work and who you hang out with. So if you want to surround yourself with only caring, intelligent and honest people, it\u2019s possible. Not automatic, not even easy, but possible.\n- And when you come across bullies, they rarely have the ability to enact the same kind of physical violence or all-out shaming you can experience as a teenager, without either law or social norms punishing them for it.\n\nI was bullied as a teenager. Not to the point I couldn\u2019t bear it but I did have pretty high anxiety and periods of mild depression from it.\nTen years later, I look around, and my bullies and toxic friends kind of self-destructed. I, on the hand, am a happy and (by my own standards) successful human being.\n\nSo if you\u2019re struggling with it, rest assured, you can absolutely overcome it once you have more agency over your environment.\n\nPS: not trying to say it doesn\u2019t happen. It does, can be just as devastating, and come from either family, friends, teammates or colleagues just the same as in high school. But if you want to leave toxic relationships or environments, I\u2019ve found it easier to do as an adult.",
            "The drama doesn't end after high school. \n\nSome people take their bullying and tantrums into adulthood. Some recognize the errors and learn from it. Some stay ignorant to it. It doesn't end. \n\nI volunteer at my daughter's school a lot, and the PTA board gets bullied a lot by parents who don't get their way. \n\nThe only thing that changes? You give up on the expectation that there's no drama after high school.",
            "Jesus, these responses are irresponsible. Listen, kid, it definitely doesn\u2019t go away, but don\u2019t get **too** depressed because of this.\n\nBeing an adult means you have a lot of tools to deal with this shit. You won\u2019t really care as much and the social fault will definitely lie with them. That means, adult bullies are usually outcasts wherever they go. And if not, most of the time you can just say fuck it and go someplace else. School, you\u2019re stuck in there and it fucking sucks. Out in the real world, actions have a lot more consequences.\n\nAlso if you ever come across someone telling you these are the best years of your life, just laugh it off. They have no idea what they\u2019re talking about. Most of them have nostalgia goggles and just miss the feeling of having their whole life ahead of them. What comes after high school is much, much better.\n\nHang in there, it\u2019ll be over soon. Work on your confidence meanwhile cause that helps a lot.",
            "Worked in healthcare for 8years before changing careers. The healthcare field is mostly dominated by women and thus can be one of the most toxic work environments you can imagine. So much back stabbing and gossiping takes place. Keeping your head down is seen as you giving permission to be walked over and standing up for yourself just makes enemies. I'm now working for a pharmaceutical lab and while things aren't perfect they're far better than what they were for me.",

            "The thing you'll realize as you grow up is that there isn't just some switch inside of you that flicks over from \"kid\" to \"adult\" when you turn 18. People mature and change, obviously, but you have to make a conscious effort to do that. Shitty teenagers often grow up to be shitty adults, they just maybe become a bit more subtle about it.\n\nThe difference though is that you are generally stuck with shitty teenagers when you're in school, but you have more options to avoid them as an adult. Still. You'll meet assholes everywhere you go, of every age.",
            "I didn't think adult bullying would happen like that but with one manager, it actually did. She blamed me for everything that went wrong in the business, expected me to come to her and not meet me half way on jobs, and went as far as to socially isolate me from the rest of the leadership team, keeping me out of socials, in jokes and purposefully posting photos of her with the other 2 girls. Everyone could see what she was doing. After 5 months, I told my area manager I wanted a transfer and in about 4 weeks I was out. I can't say I've worked with anyone like her since.",

            "Depends, are you talking \"boy\" bullying with physical violence or \"girl\" bullying with psychological abuse? Because in the adult world only trailer trash assholes solve problems with physical violence and there are much more severe repercussions for it. But unfortunately psychological abuse is still very much a thing, especially on social media.",
            "100%. \n\nWorkplace bullying is widespread.",
            "ABSOLUTELY. I was bullied by the entire staff of a lowly gas station i was working at. Straight up some high school level childishness. I had a baby like 9 months before this happened, so I realize my body didn't look the best, but thats kind of an irrelevant fact to be honest. Oh but it was MADE relevant. So, this gas station was run by a slimy old man, who had a preference to hiring high school students. Mainly girls. There was a 16!!! Year old working at this gas station who wore spandex shorts every single day as she was in cheerleading and everything, that was just easier for her to do so she didn't have to change three times a day. I totally get it. Sounds reasonable. So, in my adult brain I was like well, he obviously doesn't have a problem with us wearing short shorts to work, and I haven't been confident enough to wear anything other than loose pants in a very long time. Screw it, im gonna wear these shorts ive been staring at for months to work today, its hot, whatever. Oh no no no. All of a sudden, we have a dress code. Okay? So the fat girl wears shorts and all of the sudden we got a dress code? Nah. You a pervert, and my big ass wasn't what you wanted to stare at all day. Literally wrote me up for wearing shorts that were signicantly longer than the child's, and sent me home to change. Thats not all folks. I get back to work, borderline crying because every ounce of confidence I had built up in that 9 months was utterly shattered at that point. Made the mistake of venting to a coworker who hadn't been there so didn't know what happened. First thing that came out of her mouth- \"well not to be mean or anything, but maybe its just because you don't have the same body types\" =_= really? So each body type has a different dress code? Fat people should wear less revealing clothing simply because were fat? Okay Meghan. I left that job less than a week later. Lol",
            "If you make good choices and have some luck, you can have enough control over your life to avoid these situations.  Someone at work is bothering you?

            "Yes, but the Difference is, when you tell HR about the bullying, and they don't intervene, you threaten legal action on the company and that gets people excited. Unlike your school counselor. Try to describe your harassment as \"distracting you from your tasks \" and emphasize that it is interfering with the \" overall productivity of you and your coworkers\". If it hits them in the wallet, they will listen.",

They added services- Grooming Salons, Pet training, and PetsHotels. Some are also partnered with Banfield Pet Hospitals. They also started \u201cPetSmart Charities\u201d, which works with local shelters/rescues to provide food and care to animals. Many stores are directly partnered with local rescues and some even have adoption centers in store.\n\nPetSmart started picking up more contracts with higher end companies for pet food and apparel.
