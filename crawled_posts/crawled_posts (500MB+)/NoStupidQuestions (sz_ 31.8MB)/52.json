            "Registered dietitian here: an amputee\u2019s body requires fewer calories.** In fact, when we are calculating a patient\u2019s/client\u2019s caloric needs, there are specific percentages we use to account for the missing limb.\n\nHand: -0.7%; \nForearm + hand: -2.3%; \nEntire arm: -5.0%; \nFoot: -1.5%; \nLower leg + foot: -5.9%; \nEntire leg: -16.0%\n\n\n**EDIT: I apologize for not clarifying (I just got excited to post how we\u2019ve actually calculated body part weight percentages!): at rest, the amputated body would require fewer calories. However, due to additional energy requirements for ambulation (depending on the type of amputation, use of a prosthesis, wheelchair, etc), we would still use the above percentages to get a base rate then multiply by a particular factor to account for additional energy needs. And obviously we would monitor and make adjustments accordingly. Thanks to u/osco12 for pointing this out.",

            "Below knee amputee here; people saying that the lack of muscles/bone/etc result in less calories burned while stationary are wrong. \n\nI might burn 1/2 to 1 percent less when stationary, but burn **at least 30% more when moving around** (at least for walking, its almost certainly more when running or hiking).\n\nSo if you walk much at all, it's a net result of more calories burned.\n\nFor above knee it's MUCH higher. \n\nFor people missing an arm, it's likely the same situation. You ever so slightly less while stationary, but doing most tasks requires more effort, since.... You don't have the other arm to help.\n\n\nThis isn't a hard concept yet almost ever comment is wrong, lol",
            "While it\u2019s true that you have lost mass and therefore have lowered your basal metabolic rate you\u2019ll be burning a greater number of calories by using your prosthesis or wheelchair. The balance and strength needed to get yourself around using this equipment can send your metabolism into overdrive. Some amputees need massive amounts of calories just to break even.",
            "I don't know about this but in WW2 there was a British Fighter pilot who could pull tighter turns with higher G's because he had previously lost his lower legs so when the G forces tried to pull his blood to his lower limbs which would traditionally cause gloc (loss of consciousness) the blood couldn't go as far enabling him to hold higher g turns longer without blacking out. His name was Douglas Bader and the fact Hollywood hasn't made a movie about him is insane. At one point after getting shot down he attempted escape so many times the Germans threatened to take away his prosthetic legs. He was an ace with 22 confirmed victories and more probables, was later made a Knight, and was even housed in the famous Colditz Castle.",

And the level of amputation can make the simple act of walking spend even more.",
            "One would think. Let\u2019s look at a a patient with a single BKA (below knee amputation). If they were to remain bed bound, and assuming the amputation is completely healed, then they would require less calories to survive. However when you factor in ambulation, this actually increases overall energy expenditure necessitating more calories needed to survive. The higher the amputation, for example an AKA (above knee amputation), the more energy expenditure is needed for ambulation. Modern day prosthetics decrease this overall energy expenditure but there\u2019s still an increase in required daily caloric intake when ambulation is factored in.

Indoor garden if you want to grow things that don't survive in your climate.\n-Smoke meats/BBQ, make your own sauces and rubs from scratch\n-Sports leagues, basketball/rugby/softball/baseball/soccer/football... pickup games are a great way to make friends\n-Go to the gym, or start a home gym\n-Learn a skilled trade that you can learn for a low cost investment and is challenging. As a cloud engineer I use a bunch of free cloud credits from the platform vendors, and go through structured and challenging labs. It's a double benefit because I find it interesting and it increases my worth professionally.\n-Learn to sew, I throw away a bunch of clothes from tears because I don't know how to sew and apparently too lazy to take the article of clothing to someone else. More useful than fun.\n-Crochet, or knit, it can be very cathartic. \n-Video games, but I'm thinking of ideas you can also do outside, or at least get out and about. But to each their own.\n-I also like the idea of another Redditor that said pick a restaurant way out of the way, it kills time and is more of a trek than just eating food. Preferable if it's a nice drive along the way, through some trees or down a coast, not just on a busy freeway.\n\nJust a few to get the gears grinding.

I\u2019ve been single a long time and it\u2019s one of those things where on one hand I definitely am open to all the aspects of settling down, but I\u2019m just not compelled by wanting that. On the other hand, I\u2019ve learned a lot about myself. Like, I genuinely don\u2019t mind being alone. And that isn\u2019t for everyone. \n\nPoint being, you have to figure out what is best for you. And that takes time. It also takes the ability to be honest with yourself and being self aware. Not in any way saying you don\u2019t have that, I\u2019m just saying it for anyone reading. It takes time. \n\nLike, what do I want in life? Not, \u201cwhat do I think I should want in life based on family and friends and norms\u201d, but genuinely what do you want. You wanna be single for a while? Try it out, you may find you hate it and need companionship. Or that you desperately want children and a family. Or you may be like me and be like, \u201cwell shit, I have a good family and a small circle of great friends and a few hobbies that I really enjoy\u2026 and this is enough for now, and things might change because we as people change but it\u2019s good enough for now and I\u2019ll just make sure that for now I\u2019m just trying to stay happy and be a good person to the people who matter to me\u201d\n\nAnd, if you haven\u2019t already gleaned this from reading, I\u2019m not a big plan ahead person, it\u2019s too stressful for me. So, I\u2019m happy with what I have and who I am for now, but I might want something completely different in 1, 5, or 10 years. It took me a while to get to a place of contentment, but if things change so be it. That\u2019s life. If I have to reassess and reanalyze myself as a person and my own goals, aspirations, wants, and desires, then so be it. Part of the journey I guess. \n\nKind of like where you are now. Find things that are meaningful to you, not to fill the void of your relationship per say, but mainly to reaffirm that there\u2019s plenty more to life than the relationship you were in, even if it seemed amazing.\n\nIs it family? Not everyone has that. Is it a close group of friends? Might be difficult if your entire group was intertwined with your relationship. Hobbies? Maybe things that you didn\u2019t exclusively do with your ex. Volunteering/getting involved in your community? It\u2019s pretty liberating emotionally helping others. \n\nYou\u2019ll find your way and you\u2019ll be better for it. It just takes time. And try to remain positive and aware of when you are getting too down. It\u2019ll get easier.\n\nOr, y\u2019know, delete Facebook hit the gym yadda yadda yadda lol. Best of luck amigo.

Even if you haven't directly contacted anyone for a while, they will be excited to have you back in the circle. I learned how to record and produce music. It's really rewarding to dump your negative energy into something constructive. Especially something that produces a final product as your reward. If music isn't your thing, try wood working, painting, clay or cardboard sculptures or start to doodle. Look up tutorials on how to improve whatever your interested in and put time into improving. I got into motorcycles too, which can easily occupy your whole weekend between riding and learning how to work on them. A dog will keep you busy, and keep you company, IF  you're in the headspace to invest your time into it. Definitely makes starting a fresh social life more difficult when you live alone though.\nAlso, don't forget you're probably cooler than you think you are. It's easy to lose ourselves in a relationship, and start to identify as 2 people. Having the time to relearn who you are, what motivates you, and what brings you joy is a blessing in disguise.

            "From my own experances with this, to me food is much more important and fullfills a certain imediate desire for a specific dish ($25 is still too freaking much unless it is an extra large pizza because that lasts a good week. My price on food is like $10-$20 tops for a single meal, anything more then that does not feel right unless it can feed me for several days). \n\nMeanwhile services like Netflix, Spotify, Crunchyroll, etc etc etc, there is no guarentee I am actually going to be using the service that month. Quite a number of months I've had most of those sorts of services, I've not actually used them. Netflix I will turn on if family visits to watch something, sometimes I will hop on Spotify to listen to music (It might be once a day, once a week or once a month depending. ). Crunchyroll I watch maybe once or twice a year. So all these online services keep adding up and adding up, at one point I was paying $40+ for services I was not using and had no intention of using for a while. So I canceled most of them. And when they do a price increase, like what Netflix seems to do every year lately, it is starting to approach a level of per month that I feel I do not get out of the product. \n\n\nLike, I can buy a $40 game and get 100+ hours of entertainment out of it over several months. That said, when it comes to books, most books tend to be priced around $10 that I buy, so I am more then willing to buy the next volume in a series for $10 in a book I will have read in a day or two. This though is more to a combination of collecting things (E-books and physical books. Lately mostly E-books, but physical books look so good on a shelf), and wanting to know what happens next with my fave characters. Netflix sorta has the same thing of wanting to know what happens next, but you can get it for 1 month when your series comes out, binge it in a day and cancel for the following month.",

            "I am this. I spent 13 dollars at Wing Stop yesterday for dinner without giving it a thought. I've been on the fence about purchasing HBO Now for 15 dollars a month so that i can watch Game of Thrones for about two weeks now. It seems like a lot but at the end of the day i suppose it's 50 cents a day.\n\nI'd say the reason that it's so off putting to me is that when it comes to food, it's something that you need to purchase regardless. you need to eat to live -- even if you're not eating out, you're still spending money to eat every time you eat - at least i am. i might as well throw 3-4 extra dollars for a quick/convenient/delicious meal. Like, do i sit by the stove for 30 minutes and cook this burger i paid ~$2.00 for (one burger from a pack of 8, which costs roughly $12 bucks by me, plus a bun and condiments), or do i run to mcdonalds up the block, and come back with a full meal in 10 minutes for 4 dollars more? fuck it, sometimes you wanna grab the fast food i guess, and you're paying for the convenience as well as the food.\n\nWhen it comes to things like Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Spotify etc -- they're more of a convenient non-necessity, in the sense that if you're looking to be entertained, there are countless ways to waste your time on television (and countless subscriptions to be locked in to). If you're hungry, there is no alternative - your ass has to eat.\nIn my case with HBO, spending 15 dollars a month for access to their entire catalog, when I'm really only interested in watching two seasons of one singular show (GoT) just feels off to me, even though rationally i know that DVD collections of TV shows are more expensive than that.. But idk, I already pay 20 bucks a month for Netflix and Spotify, and i pay for Playstation Network. too. combined with Rent, Utilities, a car note, my student loans, etc, it's frustrating having all of these subscription purchases drain your paycheck immediately.

Now whenever I'm about to splurge when I'm going out, I think to myself \"That's a whole months worth of Netflix and Spotify combined\". It doesn't have to be those services in particular, it could be things from my Amazon wish list as well. \n\nI get infinitely more value in those services than I do with food that'll last me about an hour. Like a few others stated, it really is about perceived value.

            "I think it definitely has to do with the fact that food is one of our most basic necessities at a primal level. When your body starts to get hungry, your brain starts to do all kinds of things to justify eating, even if it means $25 for a UberEats delivery or ordering a $50 steak at a restaurant. When hungry, food is higher on the priority list than the money.  There isn't as much of a survival need for consuming that song or that movie when the alternative is more money in your pocket.",

I guess due to the reason most people have this mindset of \"It's just a one-off expense, it should be fine\", or at least I do anyway.\n\nAs far as mobile apps are concerned, I think the general mindset is more along the lines of \"Pretty much all of the apps of the Play Store are free (App Store, not so much from what I've heard, so assuming OP is an Android user) so why should I pay for an app when I can probably find one just as good for free?\"\n\nOn the other hand, the way see it is that subscription services like Netflix is more of a percentage of your earnings (since you pay monthly EVERY month until cancellation), and in that way people are more off-put by that fact because it's a commitment (much like u/29erfool said), and we see it as more of *another* thing to add to our monthly expenses along with rent, food, power, internet, etc, and treat it as such.

Why the hell are some people born with horrible diseases, born into slavery or war? Think about the billions who have lived only to live a life of suffering then death. Billions who perished in plague and  torture camps. Whatever happiness those unlucky bastards got is not worth the mountains of shit dealt onto them. Existence isnt even a conscious being so you can't really get mad at it, but I still do because there's nothing else to rant at. You can only gape in disbelief at how absurdly stupid it all is.\n\nWhat, are we just supposed to be grateful? People suffer so we can say, \"Thank god I have some good things too?\" I hate existence so much that even though I know I'm powerless against the universe, my greatest wish is that a being or alien who is capable enough can make everything fair and eventually just for all who ever lived. If I can help this Being achieve that, I would dedicate my life to it. Sadly this is all a fiction and impossibility at this moment, which means I can only do what I can to in this world. Though people say \"life is just about being happy\", sure I can do that and so can others, but why did all this shit even have to happen? Suffering is not needed for happiness. But within this universe I guess sacrifice is inevitable.\n\nThe most generic advice repeated billions of times is to just forget it all and be happy. It's one that works. Because as humans we are actually so powerless against whatever the fuck existence is that's all we can do to have 'mastery' over our lives.\n\nTime to ignore reality again, gotta go back to being happy or whatever. People get mad when you try to be negative and remind them about reality. \n\n",

And no life we know of is doing that with more depth than humanity. Therefore life has an intrinsic purpose - to experience as much of the universe as possible. Not just out in space understanding the largest objects, but also right here understanding and exploring the tiniest particles. And the depths and heights of the esoteric, creative ideas, digital spaces, emotional experiences. \n\nAnything you can do to expand that experience has meaning, whether experiencing things yourself and sharing them or helping others to succeed and thrive.\n\nThe universe is literally experiencing itself through us, and there is not yet any evidence that *anything* else is experiencing it like we are. When we feel love, relief, the excitement of discovery, the universe quite literally experiences that with and through us. That is a massive responsibility - we understand next to nothing, so to say our explorations and experiences are pointless is at best extremely premature.

Too many hypocrites.  Too many rules people didn\u2019t even follow themselves. \nEventually I found myself a young adult.  I lived as an atheist, surrounded by other atheists from all walks of life for some time.  If I thought about life, it was the same as this thread. We will die.  Humanity will die.  No one will remember you or your name in even 200 years.  If they do, it will be a name in a history book.  No one will ever know who you really were. \n\nThen I became friends with some good Christian people.  They even talked me into going to church with them once. Their kindness is what stood out the most.  Genuinely good, caring people.  People who were happy even though they had nothing.  Something I had not been around in quite some time.  Were they perfect? Not even close.  But they had something that I was missing. \n\nI decided it made sense to look into Christianity again.  If there is even the possibility of it being right, it should be considered and researched like your life depends on it, right?   I decided I would find whatever contradictions I could to disprove it.   \n\nI never found a contradiction in the Bible that couldn\u2019t be explained with a little research.  The more I read, the more it made sense.  \nI even looked at other religions.  You can see the glaring flaws in them without much effort. They all elevate their believers as somehow being better than non believers.  Or doing works to prove your faith.  \nReal Christian beliefs state that we are nothing without Christ, and \u201cno man can boast\u201d because we are only \u201csaved\u201d through grace.  No man can do enough to earn eternal life.  \nSorry, I know I\u2019m starting to sound preachy.  \n\nOne of the foundations of Christianity is hope; of something better after this life.

And that when I tried to make the shift from friendship to something more, most woman rightfully thought \u201che was only my friend to get with me.\u201d\n\nMy advice: Be upfront with what you want. If you meet someone and you want to date them, ask to see if they feel the same way. If not and you still want to pursue a friendship, go for it! But don\u2019t assume that by doing so that they will eventually fall for you. Be their friend because you like them as a friend, and not because you still view them as a viable romantic partner. \n\nAnd as others have said, pursue friendships with people you think are cool, regardless of gender. And know that what makes a good friend is not the same as what makes a good relationship, so aim to keep them separate in your mind.",

We like to feel turned on and experience those things, too. We are not \"whores\" for enjoying sex and wanting to experience different partners and situations. You wouldn't call a man a \"whore\" for the same behavior, would you?\n\nTry to see every woman you meet as a PERSON instead of a potential sex partner. Think about the women you know and try to think up 3 or 4 things that make them unique and individuals. Instead of categorizing Kimberly in your mind as the one with big boobs, retrain your mind to think of her as the one who likes yoga and spicy cheez-its.

The place is filled to the brim with misogynists, racists, incels etc. and being there, id argue, is feeding the harmful views of a stereotypical niceguy. Its good that youre self aware of your niceguy-ness and you probably wont turn into something worse, but 4chan can definitely put some not as self-aware people into a downward spiral where the niceguys suddenly turn into incels.",
            "Time to do some reading. Have some introspection, do some hard work, and make some changes.\n\n1st. Read No More Mr. Nice Guy by Robert A Glover\n\nIf you can afford it I would also suggest therapy. A lot of times we are unaware of our beliefs until we can freely admit them unabashedly to someone who is really listening. We can't change things until we can admit them, understand them, and feel the triggers that lead to certain behaviors. Change is always a choice.\n\nI'd also recommend Models by Mark Manson. A fantastic book to get you started in reforming your idea of relationships and dating.\n\nThen Focus on finding love for yourself and learning to not just know, but understand, accept and even love this fact:\n\nNO ONE ONE IS EVER GOING TO GIVE YOU THE LOVE THAT IS GOING TO FIX YOUR LIFE. No woman, no man, no soulmate, nobody. That's nothing to despair about. It's actually okay. Great even. The major problem with nice guy thinking and (let's be real) societal thinking in general is a (if I do/get/accomplish X then I will have happiness) This is not fucking true. As much as we want to believe it and it is advertised to us, there is no, \"and they lived happily ever after.\"\n\nSpeaking from experience here, You may meet and be with the person who fills every aspect of your \"dream woman\" list and yet still feel an emptiness and a longing for something more. The troubling thing is, you really need to fill that space in yourself BEFORE you get into a relationship with anyone. Moreover, when you get into a relationship it will take work, it will be work that you want to do (most of the time) but work none the less.\n\nLife and growth happens when we discover the lies taught to us that we have chosen to believe, we must examine those false beliefs and replace them with healthy ones. This is your journey and good on you for taking the first step in admitting a problem. Now pick up some audio books, work on yourself, and enjoy it.\n\nEdit: A big ol' link for more help.\n\nAfter that reading here is all the best advice I've gathered in maybe 15 years. I wish someone had given it to me. It is to this day the best advice that has changed my life the most [https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/gxziai/the\\_4\\_focuses\\_that\\_will\\_change\\_any\\_life/](https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/gxziai/the_4_focuses_that_will_change_any_life/)",
            "The first step might be finding a therapist to help you get to the root of why you feel this way about women. Perhaps a female therapist. This way, you\u2019ll have someone to speak candidly with about your experiences while you\u2019re trying out new behaviours in the real world. She/ he can help you stay on course. \n\nSecond, do not EVER begin a friendship with the expectation that your niceness will be rewarded with sex or romance. Friendship is it\u2019s own reward, especially with women. Women even  tend to be more willing than men to discuss feelings and vulnerabilities, which is an essential skill if you want to be a better person. \n\nWomen are equally as complex as you and all other men. They also happen to be sexual creatures who enjoy sex *just like you and other men*. They are not whores, sluts, or less-than because they enjoy the innate human right to sexual fulfilment. \n\nLike you and other men, women have interests, hobbies, aspirations, anxieties, flaws, hopes, insecurities, and passions. Women (and I speak as a woman) do not want to be simply the target of some dude\u2019s sexual fantasy/ conquest. We want to be with people (romantically or not) who are interested in finding out what drives us, what we like, who we hope to be, etc.  We are interested in people that make us want to be the best version of ourselves. \n\nOthers in this thread are saying things like, \u201cbehave such and such way and the right girl will find you\u201d. Forget that. Right now and for a considerable time in the future, you need to focus on genuinely changing how you view and understand women. Ask women about their experiences in a male dominated world. Ask them about how frightening it is to walk home alone at night for fear of being attacked or raped. Ask women if they\u2019ve ever been touched without their consent (1 in 5 women have been raped or had rape attempted) if they\u2019ve ever been called nasty, degrading terms for simply walking down the street or doing their job. Imagine how you\u2019d feel if you lived in that reality. \n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say is, women have a very different experience in the world than you do. It can be so difficult. You must try to have empathy- this is how you\u2019ll begin to truly change. It\u2019s clear that you don\u2019t want to contribute to this world any more, and for that I commend you. It is so incredibly brave to admit to yourself that you have a toxic mindset and want to do the work to change it. I hope you can achieve a healthy mindset about women over time. For what it\u2019s worth, I think you can! Good luck.\n\nEdit: as per others\u2019 comments, you, OP, should absolutely find a therapist that you feel comfortable talking to regardless of gender. The important thing is feeling comfortable enough to speak candidly, and if that\u2019s with a male therapist, that is wonderful. Choose whomever works best for you!\n\nEdit 2: wanted to clarify the \u201casking questions\u201d part. I meant to ask these questions in a context with familiarity and trust. And you would have to be the judge of that. I thought this was implied, as it\u2019s absolutely inappropriate to ask an acquaintance if they\u2019ve been assaulted. Again, better questions would be about a typical day as a woman or asking \u201cwhat is the appropriate way to compliment a woman?\u201d, etc. Asking sensitive questions is only appropriate if you are 1000% certain if she is comfortable answering.",
            "1. Being nice because you expect something in return doesn't make you a nice guy. It makes you a \"Nice Guy \u2122 \".\n2. Women are not vending machines where you put niceness in until sex/relationships come out. They're just people. Treat them as such, and think about them as such.\n3. Nobody wants a partner whose only trait is being \"nice\". Everyone is \"nice\". The cashier is nice. The bus driver is also nice. \"Nice\" is not a personality. It's the lowest, most basic of baselines. Are you interesting? kind? insightful? Are you passionate about things? Are you compassionate? What other value or personality do you have other than this hollow, meaningless \"nice\"?",
            "First you got to remove the thinking that being nice is a plus. It's actually a minimum standard. To be less than nice is a negative. So being a nice guy just makes you average.\n\nSecond, some guys are too hung up on trying to date that they forget about the important things like themselves. Ask yourself this and be truthful, if you're a woman who looks like your crush, would you go for what you are now? And if not, what needs to change? Start there and make yourself better. Not becayse you want your crush to like you, but because you want to like yourself.",
            "Something to consider. Women aren't often putting you in the friendzone. You're doing it to yourself. If you don't want to be just their friend, then you need to initiate. If they refuse, there's nothing wrong with that, accept it and move on. But you can't blame THEM for treating you as a friend because you are being friendly with secret, ulterior motives. They see it as you being a friend not as \"oh he was nice and did XYZ so now I'll fuck him\".",
            ">I get very angry when they completely see me as a friend.  \n>  \n>\\[...\\]  \n>  \n>But a conflicting part of me believes they're all whores.\n\nOh boy, where do I start. First of all you gotta stop expectations. Stop expecting to get something in return for being nice. And stop thinking that girls are whores. WTF. If you want to be nice, just be nice for the sake of being a nice human being.\n\nThere's so much stuff on this when you search around. To keep it short: Be confident. Make the first move and watch out for signals. Women send them all the time. If you misinterpret them and they reject you, be okay with it, learn from your \"mistake\" and move on. Be fucking confident and unshakeable. And always treat people with respect.",
            "Step 1 is realizing women are other people, just like you. They have hopes, dreams, aspirations, likes and dislikes. You, as a person, have things you want in life, and in other people. What makes people attractive to you is that people have those things - whether it be witty conversation, a partner you can play games or see movies with, or whatever else you care about. Remember that being nice to someone is a base-line, and that simply the absence of hostility and abuse is not actually offering anything either.\n\nStep 2 is looking at yourself in a mirror - literally, if possible. Think if you were another person, what do you think would be desirable in yourself. Think about whether the person in the mirror is showing those attributes to their best effect. If you come up blank, what can you do or learn in order to meet that criteria better. There's a reason women tend to love guys in bands, or people who appear well-educated or elloquent. They show an interest in the world beyond just themselves, and they've worked to make themselves more interesting people. \n\nStep 3 is taking action. This could be as simple as doing a push-up or taking a shower. It could be making a list of jokes to study that you could throw into conversation. It's making a concerted, real effort to change something in order to move away from what you were to something new. Expect this step to fail. A lot. Self-improvement is super hard, and requires immense dedication - everyone is doing it, and you're competing with everyone when it comes to socialising. Maybe with some groups you don't care and it feels natural, but even then there are things you know you can and can't say.\n\nThere are traps to fall into here as well - for example, if you're unemployed you could get a job. You might rebel to this idea and say \"But then I'm only attracting gold diggers\" - no, you're showing you can hold down a job. You know what's really attractive? Showing you have the dedication and determination to do something that sucks in order to work towards something that doesn't. Even if you never spent a penny, you'd be proving that you can do something that's hard and has a measurable improvment. How about studying? Learning a language? Maybe you think it'd feel fake or forced or wouldn't work. People make it work. Maybe it'll fail the first time. Maybe it'll fail the next time. Always fail forwards. Learn a little more each time you fail. Remind yourself you're doing this for you, and you owe it to yourself to do it. Don't ever feel like you're letting yourself down, but always feel it's part of the process.\n\nStep 4 is changing your social circle. As you move on, you need to be willing to let people go. The only way you can meet new people is to let go of the old.",
            "Stop lumping women together like they are all the same. View all humans as individuals, regardless of sex or gender. Don\u2019t assume you know anything about anyone just because you know their sex or gender. The world will make a lot more sense then.",

Real friendships between people of any gender are about genuine human connection. \n\nI\u2019d suggest engaging with some feminist resources to try and understand the female experience better, and unlearn some of the toxic thoughts you\u2019ve had. \n\nIt\u2019s great you made this realization about yourself, keep on this self discovery journey.",

Being nice is a reward in and of itself.\n\nFocus on living your life in such a way that if a romantic relationship never came into it, you'd still have many fulfilling ways of happiness. I know that's never what you want to hear, but that's the best way to not only attract a romantic partner but to have a healthy relationship once you find one.\n\nWomen don't want a man whose only personality is wanting to be with them. They want someone with a full, flourishing interior life. Pick up hobbies that are either social (D&D, team sports, bar trivia, anything outside of the internet/video games really) or constructive (woodworking, weight lifting, painting, gardening). Ideally, both social and constructive. If you follow these, the romance portion will take care of itself.\n\nI know dudes who dated a lot in their teens and in college who are miserable and single now. I know guys who didn't get laid until they were 25 but now have the hottest wife and two kids and everything they ever wanted.

            "Ok, so you've done the first step very well, and you should be congratulated for that.  Genuinely, and from the bottom of my heart, good job!\n\nThe next part is hard, mostly because there isn't really a guide, and because there are a lot of people/communities that will encourage this kind of toxic behavior.  But, it is doable!    What really works when it comes to making big worldview changes is to change a lot of small, daily habits, and to make a sort-of related, but not ultimately linked, goal.  \n\nStarting with daily habit changes, the things to do are to engage in a new behavior, rather than just telling yourself \"stop doing that!\" Because just saying stop doesn't help you do something else, as you have realized. I'm gonna suggest starting to big mental habits and adjusting your small habits as necessary:\n\nBig Habit 1: thinking of women as Individual people, not a demographic.\n\nThis is hard, because you are being conditioned to think of everyone not like you as a demographic at all times.  Most of this depersonalization is the side effect of capitalism treating people like market blocks, but there are also lots of people out there fostering bigotry because it makes you feel isolated and therefore easy to manipulate.  Misogyny is a big one, but racism, queerphobia and religious discrimination all rely on this mechanic, so the tricks here can be used to unfuck your brain on those subjects too!\n\n-practice thinking of your female friends as individuals.  What do they sound like? How tall are they compared to each other? Do you know thier birthdays? Start small, like you're describing them to readers in a book you're writing.  Then move on to things like: what birthday gift would they love? What gift would they hate? What kind of music do they remind you of?  Really get to know them as individual human beings.  This exercise helps you build up your social skills, improve your memory, and gets you thinking about them as who they are, rather than what they can do for you.\n\n-when a woman disappoints you, which will happen, instead of thinking of it as \"women always do X\" think of it as \"this specific individual has disappointed me in this specific fashion today.\". For example \"Stacey didn't clean out the coffee pot today and that disappoints me\" rather than \"bitches never do thier part\". This will help in several ways: thinking of women as individual people, not generalizing behavior, not catastrophising behavior that upsets you, and being honest with yourself about what people have actually done.  Does Stacey not contribute or is she just forgetful?  In my experience, people are 98% kind of oblivious and didn't mean any harm, but we tend to sort of bump into each other anyway, and of the remaining 2%, most of them are malicious but for reasons entirely unrelated to you, and like, one in 10,000 people actually means you harm.\n\nBig Habit 2: learning to love yourself.\n\nThis sounds counterintuitive, but the harder you look for a romantic/sexual partner, the worse luck you're going to have.  Desperation is a terrible cologne, and no matter how 'nice' you think you're being, your microexpressions and hidden goals betray you, and you end up giving off a very distressing vibe.\n\nThe trick is to step back, stop looking for a while, and learn to love being yourself, because when you love being yourself, being your genuine self is easy, and when you are out being yourself, you give off the vibe of a calm, confident guy and that *really hot*.\n\nAlso this is the perfect time to start this because you shouldn't be going anywhere during a pandemic, so:\n\n-get therapy.  Yeah, yeah, everyone says this, but even if you're not 'mental' practically everyone benefits from it.  A therapist can also give you way more targeted and accurate advice than an internet rando.  Also \"hey I realized I'm being an asshole and want to change\" is like, the best thing a therapist can hear and they will be so thrilled to have you.\n\n-while you're getting a therapist though: develop some hobbies.  Not marketable hobbies, things you genuinely enjoy, even if it's weird.  Actually, especially if it's weird.  Wanna get really into breeding freshwater shrimp? Do it.  Tabletop rpgs? Good! Woodworking? Learning a dying language? Painting every room in your house a different color? YES!!  \n\nGetting a \"weird\" hobby does several things for you:. You are more enjoyable to be around when you're having fun. You'll meet new people and make more friends for the sake of having friends which you need to practice, you'll have something to talk about when meeting new people AND, MOST IMPORTANT: meeting someone in who is into the same weird shit as you is the best kind of romance.\n\nSmall suggestion on selecting a WEIRD hobby: hobbies that produce tangible objects or changes are better for your overall mental health than purely intangible hobbies like competitive gaming or suchlike.  Also they let you make cute gifts.\n\n-while it's not remotely necessary to be any kind of conventionally attractive and I find love, keeping up with body maintenance and not hating your body really, really helps.\n\nStart with the kind of basic care for yourself as you would give to say, a dog you were responsible for.  Staying clean, getting enough food and good food, mild to moderate exercise, mental stimulation, going in for regular checkups, taking your meds.  Because, what is your body if not an animal you are responsible for?\n\nNext, if you are annoyed with your body for not preforming the way you want it to, pick an activity you want to be able to do, and work on what you need to do to be able to do that thing.  This year, I want to hike a 7-mile round trip trail with +500ft elevation gain without puking, for example.  This means exercise, nutrition and getting my inner ears examined.\n\nOk, to sum up:\n1. Good job realizing this and trying to change\n2. Changing will take time and effort. Like a couple years worth.\n3. Practice thinking of women as Individual people by being as specific as possible about the ones you know\n4. Work on learning to love yourself and the person you want to become\n\nI wish you the best of luck",

            "You can't be nice and claim all women to be whores. I think you seriously need to get off 4chan for a start because I don't hear too many positive things coming out of that direction to be completely honest with you. I don't know how old you are and what you're like in person etc etc but honestly wanting women to like you is normal but being really angry about it, whilst probably also a natural reaction, is not the right thing to do.\n\nSome people don't have relationships till they are much older and that is completely fine.

Like there's a whole spectrum of personalities across both genders, from quiet librarian types who will only sleep with one to a handful of men their entire lives (and with the lights off) to girls in stilettos who'll drink and fuck (in public restrooms) because it's fun for them. \n\nI just don't understand the thinking behind ignoring one end of the spectrum and believing it doesn't exist or that it's a tiny minority?? Maybe it's where these people live and what they see day to day, but like humanity is vast and varied... I take each man I meet as they come without any broad preconcieved notions because I know we are rediculously varied (even amonst the gays), but umm... to not realise women are the same is really really strange. Maybe I recognise it because i've mostly connected with female friends over the years but yeah, moral of the story is everybodies different. Let sluts be sluts and if that's not your thing, don't focus on them - focus on the librarians or someone else closer to the traits you desire in a companion.\n\nI mean that's prob not your problem by the sounds of it, it sounds like you expect sex from nice girls for being nice to them??

Maybe you need to take some time and work on yourself. By that I mean try to evaluate how you gained these views and who is installing or reinforcing them in you. I know places like Reddit and 4chan can be guilty of this. So try to remove yourself from any toxic groups like that and just try to have normal platonic relationships for a while. I will say that being friends with a woman is not such the detriment people think. Sure it hurts that your feelings arent reciprocated, but women typically know other women. You could ask your friends to set you up with someone they know or have them help you polish your dating profile. Dudes usually have bad bio. Another tip is make your intentions known a little sooner. Don\u2019t always wait for them to make the first move. Life is an active experience you have to put yourself out there and shoot your shot.

As long as you wear a \"perfect person\" mask, you will never be able to make real connections with anyone. Peoples' flaws are what make them interesting to others. To make real connections with people, you have to be vulnerable. The more open you make yourself to being hurt, the more opportunities to connect with others you will have. The second biggest hangup for me: Acting needy is something almost nobody likes, except maybe your mom. It is nobody's job to meet your needs, except you.

Women like hot guys. Just like YOU like hot women. After the baseline of feeling safe around someone is established, women want the guy who is attractive. They don't want a little boy. That doesn't make them whores, it makes them women. I don't imagine you look at how nice a girl acts as the primary indicator of attractiveness. You look at their looks, their interests, their personality, their sense of humor. Well, so do women.",
            "Reflection is the first step. You have come to the conclusion that you are a nice guy. That's good. Becuase most nice guys never realize how they are behaving. You however do realize that it's wrong. That's the first step.   \nBecome self aware of when it happens and think about how you can change it. My tip? Try to be nice for the sake of being nice and drown out the intrusive thoughts of \"maybe she'll give me something in return\". I know, easier said than done",

You\u2019re pretending to be a nice guy thinking that is what these women want. You have underlying motives to your \u2018niceness\u2019 which is manipulative and malicious.

            "Not all woman are going to jump to the first nice guy they meet. Make a move, suggest that you\u2019re romantically attracted to them. Some women aren\u2019t looking for a romantic partner in every man, so if you\u2019re rejected, know that it\u2019s not personal. Now, there are some women (and men!) who only look for their made-up perfect partner and never appreciate the people that really love them, so if you suspect someone of being that shallow, don\u2019t waste your time. Ask the women to you want to be romantically involved with to be romantically involved. Otherwise some people may never make the first move because they\u2019re waiting for you!",
            "You've already taken the first and most important step: understanding that your views are detrimental to yourself, the people around you, and society. So...\n\nAs someone who used to harbour some serious \"nice guy\" tendencies, here's my advice: switch from the \"nice\" mindset to the \"kind\" mindset. It's a subtle difference that might only exist in my own head, but I've always seen \"nice\" as more of an action. (ie: you're being \"nice\" to me), whereas kindness is a true personality trait (ie: he is a kind person). It's impossible for a human to always be \"nice.\" Sometimes, you gotta put your foot down, you gotta put yourself first, you gotta use tough love, especially on yourself. Unlike niceness, which is often meek and subordinate, kindness can sometimes mean telling someone what they need to hear even if it isn't \"nice.\"   \n\n\nBeyond that, it's important to develop personality traits beyond kindness. There's an old song you'll probably hear at every wedding you go to called \"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun,\" and it's true. If a woman isn't enjoying her time with you, it doesn't matter how much gifts and compliments you shower her with. Honestly, you gotta entertain her; reversely its not unreasonable to expect the same back. Life is too short to waste on boring people.  \n\n\nSo, how do I not be boring, you ask? Well, the key to that is passion in everything you do. I have been entertained and extremely interested by the most mundane subjects or activities because the person who was talking/doing was passionate about the thing. It doesn't matter the activity/subject, if you pursue it with passion you will make it interesting. I once had a girlfriend who was OBSESSED with mosses and lichens, just found them to be the most interesting thing in the world. And when we went hiking, it was an absolute joy to see her explain the minutia of the forest to me. Luckily for a lot of us guys, women are more and more getting into \"nerdy\" pursuits like gaming, comics, anime, D&D, etc, so if that's your jam go to town! The amount of cute girls at anime conventions is ridonkulous - just don't be one of *those* guys at the convention.   \n\n\nFurthermore, never EVER judge a woman for who she chooses to share her body with, whether it's a thousand guys before she's 25 or one guy who she saved herself for marriage for or for another woman. It's her body to share with who she will, and it's none of your business unless she gives her consent for it to be your business (ie: a monogamous relationship, or a healthy open one). Using the word \"slut\" or \"whore\" derogatively is like cutting the head off a Hydra: for every woman you call a slut, there's ten more that have just closed their legs to you permanently.  \n\n\nYou're young, and unfortunately boys growing up are often subject to very toxic influences. I don't lay blame on them: they are products of their environment, and honestly girls can be downright mean to boys, especially during the teen years. You will mature, the important thing is to not be resistant to new modes of thinking. It sounds like you already got that part down. Thank you, and good job!  \n\n\nA good quote I read on the internet once upon a time and has become the foundation of my entire dating philosophy: It's up to YOU to become attractive to the type of person you're attracted to.\n\nAnd lastly, never EVER neglect your health and personal hygiene. Especially your hygiene.",
            "Good for you, I went through a Nice Guy phase a long time ago, and it's \\*tough\\* to pull away from the insanity. Especially if no-one calls you on this shit early on.\n\nAs to fixing your thinking - first of all, be honest if you're attracted to someone. Don't make a production of it, and don't make a big thing of it in your mind. Either decide not to say or do anything and move on, or say something. She either will be interested or not - the former is what you wanted and you can just be normal and non-creepy about it. The latter is frustrating, but it clears the air and you can move on.\n\nSecondly, women are people (what a radical concept!). Don't think of them as potential partners by default, think of them as people who have romantic and sexual needs and preferences, but also care about other things that everyone cares about. Don't make interactions with a woman into a test of whether she'll be into you.\n\nThirdly, when you're interested in a woman just for sex or short-term dating or whatever, it's not bad. If you take \"no\" for an answer, if you're not creepy or stalky about it, it's fine to not have a deep, complex relationship. It's fine to, for the lack of a better word for it, lust for someone (as long as you respect boundaries and back off if there's no mutual interest, and as long as you don't make any advances when it's inappropriate or there's a power imbalance). It's honest and wrapping it in faux-friendliness makes it much worse.",
            "Something big i didn't see many people mention, get out of toxic spaces. Its likley going to be difficult and maybe sting a bit because you may have friends there and feel like part of a community but if you want to change it is really important to cut out all the people and spaces that have fostered and encouraged this way of thinking. \n\nI'd also suggest potentially seeking professional help (there really is no shame in that and shouldn't be) and as much as you may want to be in a relationship I personally feel you should tuck the dating advice in this thread away for later and do some serious work on yourself before you try to bring someone else into your life in that capacity. \n\nIt is fantastic that you recognize and want to change this behavior and I sincerely wish you the best in doing so and remember women are just people, same as men, they all have different interests, hobbies, likes, dislikes, hopes and dreams and a big step is just remembering to treat them like people.",
            "Ypu have some good stuff here.\n\nFor a shodt term tangible next step: start adjusting your i formation consumption. You talk about complaining on 4chan boards. Odds are you are doing that on boards where plenty of other people are validating you and also basking in this attitude. Start pulling yourself away from that. We are social creatures and we are pliable based on the community we keep and messages we fill our days with. \n\nWhat we read trains us.\n\nIt is harder to have the will power to avoid eating sweets in the fridge all week than the will power to not buy the sweets for the hour you are in the store. Same thing, uninstall aps or just don't go certain places, rather than fighting each time to struggle with each post coming at you.\n\nAnd on the flip side, start consuming things that will help. If you are a fiction reader, then read a few books with strong, interesting female protagonists. (I'm a big fan of the 5th Season/Broken Earth trilogy. Try some tv shows with female main characters. Yes, these are fiction. But fiction is one way we learn how to human. It shapes the way we look at others. This is why people say representation matters.\n\nIt might even be a good topic of conversation with some of your female friends. If any are avid readers, just leg then kniw a new years resolution is that you want to read a more diverse set of authors and characters. Do they have any favorite books with strong female protagonists. If you take their advice and read it it also gives you something genuine to hold follow up conversations (don't see this as a sneaky ploy... and don't think if you read their book you get sex. But just as a way of building deeper platonic friendships with people in your life). Or there are plenty of lists online.\n\nAnd if you are a nonficton reader, then grab a biography or autobiography of some famous women.\n\nBasically, the point is to start training yourself to see women as 3 dimensional beings, and just as importantly, as different from one another.\n\nIf you are a podcast listener, whatever subject you like mix some female hosts into the mix.\n\nAlso blend some positive male role models in. I'm a fan of the sub r/menslib. Mostly a community of men trying to be better men, sharing articles, and discussing things. There are a variety of opinions there, but the comment sections are among the least toxic of any subreddit I've found.\n\nAnd lastly is starting to get up the courage to ask. And realize the world doesn't end with a no. If you like a girl enough to want to date them, then you should also like them enough to respect their decision. There is a saying in fundraising that \"no is the second best answer to yes.\" Basically, knowing the answer is no is a valuable gift too. Obviously not as gun as a yes, but it lets you have certsinty and move on.\n\n\n\n\n\nI hear (and recognize in my younger self) many of the things you said. Recignizing this in yourself can't have been easy. But the good news is that naming this about yourself is almost half the battle. \n\nGood luck!",
            "I was also somewhat like this.  You know what I realized? It's not that women don't like nice guys.  It's that they like confident, fun, flirtatious guys. The same goes for men->women too if you think about it. We are attracted (romantically or platonically) to people who are fun and confident.\n\nYou can be fun, confident, flirtatious, AND nice.  As soon as I started to put myself out there and take risks I started getting dates and girlfriends.  I'm now super-happily married for 7 years and I'm still a \"nice guy\" to my wife.  But I have other qualities that go with that.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with being confident and flirtatious.  Yes, some (probably most) women will reject you.  But as long as you're not an asshole they're reject you kindly, and that fine.  Finding the right parter takes a lot of trial and error.  Just know when to recognize that something's not clicking (for you or her) and to let it go. \n\nAlso, real life isn't a chick flick.  Relentlessly pursuing a love interest won't win them over.  It's creepy and a red flag for them.  If someone rejects you, just smile and say something kind back and move on.",
            "**One:** Work on being a *genuinely* nice person, not because you want to score with women but because it's a better way to go through life.  \nWomen can actually tell if you're being nice just to date them or if you are genuinely a nice person.  It makes a huge difference.\n\n**Two:** Do not get angry with women who see you as a nice guy and friend.  A woman seeing you as a friend is a huge success.\n\n**Three:**  Absolutely do not cut ties with women who see you simply as a nice guy and friend.  They have female friends as well who are single.  Once they work out that you really are just a nice guy and not just being nice just to get in their pants, they will introduce you to their single female friends who will want to date you.",
            "If you like a girl, act like you like her. Otherwise, she'll think that you're just some nice guy and not sunshine with a crush on her. Try flirting, and asking girls out. If your get rejected, at least you won't waste any more time and you'll know for sure she's not into you, and you can move on to someone else. I've had the same problem as you, and because of reddit, I realized that i was also only being nice in order to get people to like me. But it's so much more rewarding being honest to people and letting them know how you really feel. No one can read your mind, and people depend on you to actually TELL THEM what you're thinking and feeling. So, try speaking up more, don't be afraid to embarrass yourself. It can make for a funny story later on",
            "Why do you think theyre all whores? They wont touch you so cant be that whoreish.",
            "Hi! I'm a woman. I also had a habit in my 20's of seeing every guy as a potential partner, and I'm sure it colored how I treated them. I didn't feel angry if they weren't interested though. More just anxious that no one ever would be. \n\nHere's some tips. \n\nMaybe get off the places like 4chan that perpetuate this cycle of being angry at not being seen as a romantic partner. \n\nI don't know how old you are, so the answer depends on that, but I would work on your relationships with women you know who CAN'T be romantic partners. Your mom, sisters, grandma, co-workers, friends wives or girlfriends. How you reflected on how those relationships are? Do you perhaps treat all women a certain way, even when they can't reject you?\n\nAre you proud of where you are? Are you proud of what you're doing, and how hard you're working, and the chances you take, and the people who spend your time around? Do you know what you value? Do you fight for it? It's a lot easier to find cool people to be around when you don't need anything from them because you're confident in who you are, and what you value. (I feel like the male equivalent to this advice is \"hit the gym.\" I think gyms can have their own toxic male cultures, so I am iffy about that. But if hitting the gym makes you sleep better, think more clearly, and feel better about yourself, then do it.)\n\nIf you're really brave, tell some women who have not turned into romantic interests or that you have in your circle, that you think you may have drifted into some toxic masculinity thoughts, and you want to hear what they have to say. They might tell you some things you would never think of. They might tell you some bullshit too, but it's about having conversations about this in the real world. (though kudos for doing it here.)\n\nAnd I'd really examine where your anger towards women comes from. I'd also examine what in your life is feeding that anger (like 4chan). Do you have good friends in your life? Cool friends who treat women awesome and who you admire and inspire you to be a better person? Or do your friends also kind of drag you back to the same place of feeling bad about yourself not attracting female attention and then anger at women.\n\nAlso: act. Stop waiting for a woman to realize you like her, and pursue you. I am just as clueless about hints as any guy. I have probably had tons of guys like me and had no idea because they never said anything. I have also had guys pine over for me for months or years before they got up to the courage to say something, and then declare their undying love, instead of just asking me out on a date the first time they realized that they would like to do that. \n\nI know it's hard to ask someone on a date. I've done it a lot. But before you start doing it, figure out how to sit with being turned down. Rejection is just a \"no, thanks.\" It's not a \"Ugh, no way not ever.\" Or \"You're not at my level\" or \"I sentence you to being single.\" It's just \"No thanks\"\n\nHere's some of the reasons I've told a guy no thanks to a date. Notice how few of them are about him. \n\nMy mental health is a mess and I don't feel like dating\n\nI like someone else and am working on asking them out\n\nI am getting over someone I liked a lot\n\nI am moving soon\n\nI worry the person wants to date casually, and I don't have the energy for that. \n\nI work with them and I don't date co-workers\n\nI have a friend who has a crush on them who would be heartbroken if we went out\n\nThey seem at a very different place in their life (buying a house, setting down, I'm not sure if I'm about to quit my job and move to another country). \n\nThey are really religious and I'm not\n\nThey seem to hold political views that I would want to argue about all the time. \n\nI've also said no to people because they seem unintelligent, or awkward, or seem angry, or arrogant, or post gym selfies to facebook. Some of those are character judgements, and some of those are just \"I don't think we'd really get a long if you got to know me better.\"\n\nWay more of the time I say no because I don't really like it's a good fit, even though the guy is nice and there's nothing at all wrong with him.",

            "As far as addressing the frustration when women don\u2019t make the first move goes, why not just change up how you approach dating? I don\u2019t think directness is a bad MO. Women can usually tell when somebody is being nice with a motive, and it\u2019s uncomfortable. Being open about where you\u2019re coming from is not uncomfortable in the same way (usually) as long as it\u2019s done from a no-pressure kind of place. \n\nEg: \u201chey, I\u2019ve been really enjoying hanging out with you the last couple of weeks. Would you like to go out for a drink on the weekend?\u201d \n\nDon\u2019t even bother trying to pretend you\u2019re her friend, just put your cards on the table. \n\nIf you get a no, take it and move on. Don\u2019t try and stay friends with women you can only see as potential lovers. Drop the idea of romance totally, or cut contact. You\u2019ll save everybody a lot of time and hurt feelings. \n\nWhat you want to avoid is the love-bombing kind of \u2018directness.\u2019",
            "Hello, female there. First off, I'm making some generalizations based on my personal experiences and that of my friends. But here is the problem with nice guys: Girls do not want to feel like an option, they want to feel special and unique. Nice guys treat all girls the same (typically, or at least the difference is not noticeable to the girl) and girls do NOT want to be with someone who likes everyone or someone who would go out with any of the girls in their life. They want to feel like they won by having you like them and take romantic interest in them. Girls are very romantic, and while it may be a silly, girls wants to feel like they are \"the one\" to you. Also nice guys wait way too long to show any interest outwardly, girls can easily put guys into the friendzone even if they were interested earlier. \nSo here's what you do. Figure out what you like, and when you find a person that resembles that criteria then go after that person, and flirt a little, joke around with them, make them feel special. Nice guys are always afraid to flirt for some reason or they wait too long, and as long as you're not creepy about it, it'll be fine. \n\nThis is not to say you can't have friends that are girls, just don't treat your friends the same as people you are interested in. You can also be talking to multiple people, as long as the multiple people is not every girl that you know haha.\n\nHope this helps :) relationships that are worth it take risks, and while being the first to flirt or show interest may be terrifying, but most girl recognize that it takes guts to do that (even if they don't like you back). I wish you the best and good luck!\n\nTL;DR Do not treat every girl the same, and make sure the difference in how you treat them is noticeable, and don't be afraid to flirt a little and don't wait too long.",

            "Sounds to me like you're still approaching your 20s? \n\nA little late, but my two cents: there's nothing explicitly not nice about being flirtatious or playful with someone. Being 'nice' comes down to your ability to read, understand, and ultimately respect someone's boundaries. \n\nUnfortunately not all of us are natural flirts, so believe me when I say just be patient. Learn to accept rejection and decouple your pride from the opinions of others. True confidence comes from being in familiar situations, being comfortable with the worst case outcome. \n\nAnd confidence is sexy. \n\nI also assumed in my teens that girls just wanted a guy who was just nice to them. There's much more to it. And once you break into this space and understand more women, you'll start to understand what modern masculinity can be.

That's your situation. If you keep surrounding yourself with other nice guys, you won't break this cycle\n\nStep 2- Start with just... being nice. Do not expect anything in return, just follow the golden rule- do onto others as you would have done unto you. Try this with EVERYONE you meet, not just women. Retrain your brain that nice doesn't come with conditions, its the default setting. Note that this doesn't mean you need to let people walk all over you. If someone is a dick to you, fuck em. It says more about them than you. Don't let people live rent free in your head, just walk away.\n\nHonestly, I'd spend the next month of your life at step 2. See where it goes. People can smell conditional nice a mile away and its super offputting- its the used car salesman vibe.  Once you stop being nice to people conditionally, you may find that others naturally want to be around you. \n\nStep 2.5- If there's some personal hygiene work to be done, now is a good time to do it.

Research after research has shown that men that fall into the red pill/MGTOW/Incels suffered from low self esteem. Get your own confidence and self awareness up. This will be the HARDEST part.\n\nSecond is to have a genuine interest in the women you meet. You see a woman and are thinking sex, but change your approach by seeing if this person could actually be a friend. Do you share similar interests? Ask her genuinely what her interests are. What does she like to do for fun and would you be interested in that hobby without her? That's how you make friends by seeing what you have in common and sharing those things together. This way when the \"sex\" part fails you have any actual friend. \n\nPersonal anecdote, I've had crushes on friends over the years and have been shut down (and vice versa) but we were actually friends that we survived that and kept being friends.\n\nThird, really all yourself why it bothers you so much if a woman is sleeping with a stranger every night (which is more than likely not true). Are you jealous (either that's she's having more sex than you or with other people then you? Then it has nothing to do with her and are taking YOUR insecurities out on her. \n\nIf it's religious (which doesn't sound like it) then be friends with people who share similar religious beliefs.",

Fortunately her desk partner is very friendly, and she introduces her to everyone, explain parts of the office culture and offers to be a lunch buddy. As they get to know each other better, they start bonding over tv shows, their pets and being two single women in the city. They even start hanging out outside of work and form a very close friendship.\n\nAfter a few months, the desk partner stops talking to her. She stops responding to texts, starts making excuses about lunch, and generally avoids her. The woman has no idea what has caused this, and now has to navigate the office without the support of her friend, and is racking her brain of what she could have done wrong. Eventually, the woman confronts her desk buddy, and asks what happened and apologises for any offense she may have caused.

            "I'm glad you realize this is a problem and want to change this way of thinking. That's the first step. You have gotten some good advice here, I would start by not expecting girls to jump on you because you are nice. Be nice because you should treat people with respect and if you are interested in a woman try to spark their interest. Ask them to dinner, or a movie or just to hang out and be sociable. Try not to internalize rejection or take it as an affront to your self worth. Relationships and dating is the testing ground to see if a long term partnership would work. What if she eats her boogers. Well I would think you know she isn't the one. Same for you, she may think you are too quiet or too much of a pushover and not be romantically interested. It's not that you are bad she just doesn't see herself with a guy like you. Trust me there is someone out there that wants a dude just like you but if love was easy to find the words would be much different. \n\nAlso why do you think all women are whores?

He had only one girlfriend before we met and she broke up with him because she couldn't see him as more than a friend. Luckily I came along and made the first move because I thought he was funny and sweet and amazing. I DEFINITELY do not see him as just a friend, and I love how nice he is.\n\nNot every girl is going to like you. It is actually not easy at all to find someone you are compatible with. According to your post, you are still very young, and I'm sure you are tired of hearing that. But it's going to take quite a few failed matches before you find someone that totally digs your nice guy personality. \n\nPlease don't change yourself because you're not \"getting girls.\" And also, never ever expect a girl to like you just because you are nice.

            "I was on the edge of nice guydom for several years, so I can tell you the ideas that got me out of that:\n1. Women are people, and it\u2019s ok not to like somebody. If you were the object of unrequited attraction you would understand. And yes, they can have flaws. I had the tendency to both idolize and demonize people for superficial qualities. Understand that you don\u2019t know everything about people.\n2. Being nice is nice, but not everything. Though people generally do like partners who are nice, it\u2019s only one of many factors, and people usually don\u2019t choose each other over 1 quality. If you want to be liked, work on other social qualities, like humor and confidence. Of course, there are people who seem to go for the \u201cbad guys\u201d. I have a friend like this, who seems to end up in relationship issues with just about every guy she dates. Don\u2019t blame yourself for this. Also, it probably isn\u2019t your place to intervene in her relationships if you\u2019re not super close. But understand, a white knight swooping in won\u2019t fix this sort of thing. This is usually something that people have to confront themselves, even if they do have support.\n3. Realize you don\u2019t really need a girlfriend/wife to be happy and worth something. There are many paths to self worth. I realized that the reason I was so fixated on being single was that I wasn\u2019t satisfied with my friendships at the time. Hell, being a loner isn\u2019t even all that bad if you\u2019re doing things you enjoy.\n4. One method for me to learn empathy towards people was to constantly think about the motives of people around me. This may sound paranoid, but I don\u2019t really mean it in that way. Just think about what people\u2019s goals are, not just their feelings, and you can come to better understand people you thought were superficial. I\u2019d say this is the most important step for me from *nice guy* to nice guy.\n5. Forgive yourself: as long as you become better, don\u2019t be too hard on yourself for your past failings.

Nobody likes feeling taken for granted or deceived. \nYou are not the problem; you have a problem. So many men have discovered how this behavior is perceived by women and leaned their way past it. Self-reflection is the first step. You can proceed with confidence that your frustration is stoked by centuries of (I know it's a common and over-used phrase, but there's a reason for that) toxic masculinity. \n\nThe problem is how society has taught young men how to view women and how it has failed to give them tools to successfully navigate important social situations like expressing romantic interest in someone. Start with treating everyone with respect, baseline. Then, when you feel like there might be some interest returned by the other person: don't be shady, there's nothing wrong with expressing interest, just be clear and honest with your intentions (the masking of intentions is a red flag for obvious reasons). \n\nOnce you start to adopt healthier views of relationships (there are a lot described online to stumble into), you can start to keep yourself and the people you care about safe from them too.

If yes, you are a nice child. If you do nice things to get close to them for sex, please know you are a pig.\n\nHow to change:\n\nBe a real nice guy. And if because you are a child you get too close and feelings of love are born, tell them. If she doesn\u2019t feel the same way (that is her right), stop being her friend (if the pain becomes unbearable.)\n\nAre you really sure what you want to ask is not how to get girls to consent to have sex with you?\n\nIn case you want a partner, a real partner, let her know you are attracted to her physically. But before you ask her out, you want to know her better. Innocent things, being around her to confirm she is not bat shit crazy. That you want to know her as a person. For example, does this girl like broccoli?",

            "Something it took me a (way too long) while to grasp as a young adult is that women are attracted to men the same way men are attracted to women.  Conversely, the same way men DON'T find themselves attracted to all women, women DON'T find themselves attracted to all men. \n\nIt sounds crazy, but as a teenager I couldn't grasp the idea that girls are seeking out boys of similar age for dating and physical relationships just like boys are seeking the same from girls.  I honestly spend a lot of years thinking that girls/young women (of similar age) required convincing that they should be attracted to me (or anyone).  It was a belief that if I fell for a girl that became a close friend, if I just tried hard enough they would feel the same for me.  As such I expended months or years engaged in friendships with girls that were never going to see me as anything but a great or \"best\" friend.\n\nAfter graduating high-school I came to realize that there were indeed girls who were attracted to me in HS, girls that looking back I would have totally enjoyed dating and spending time with.  But my fixation on 2 or 3 girls that I was desperately thirsty for led me to get perpetually stuck in the \"friend zone\" instead of engaging with other girls.  The realization didn't come until I was 18 (almost 19) and had really only had one minor real relationship during high-school.  I was devastated and embarrassed at my lack of understanding... my naivete... and missed opportunities with young women who I could have dated OR just been friend with had I not spend the prior years trying too hard to be with girls that simply DID NOT want to date me.\n\nIt wasn't easy thinking to break free from.  In college I FINALLY learned that having a friendship with a woman was a desirable thing separate from having relationship with a woman I was attracted to.  I learned to be more upfront and direct and to actually take a kind \"no\" from a woman who wasn't interested in me for what it was.  \n\nI've rambled on long enough, I hope what I've said makes some sense.  My 20s were a long learning experience in many ways, but my cringy actions as a teen taught me how to try not to be a douchebag. I'm 36 and have a relationship (though strained by Covid) that makes me happy.  I've never been a huge \"ladies man\" but I have friends and a fun relationship that may or may not last. Once I was aware of my shortcomings it made life much easier.  I wish I had realized at a younger age what a that I was tho!",
            "I think the whole \u201cnice guy\u201d thing is a big falsehood that keeps getting spread around.\n\nMost \u201cnice guys\u201d really are nice people. But somewhere along the lines, you realize that nobody wants to date you. You see guys being jerks to girls and see how those men who are jerks have a new girlfriend every month.\n\nYou realize that being a regular decent person is not good enough. And it makes you angry to come to said realization. To see that women don\u2019t actually want nice people, and prefer jerks and assholes.\n\nSo what do you do? You\u2019re lost because you\u2019re a genuinely nice person. But you don\u2019t know how to get a date because just being who you are up to this point has not worked.\n\nI think the problem I that when the \u201cnice guy\u201d asks for advice, everyone bashes on him and tells him he\u2019s a piece of shit. He\u2019s a self entitled little asshole who in reality is a bad person who acts nice to trick women into giving them sex.\n\nI don\u2019t think this is the case at all.\n\nThe reality is this person is lacking social skills in the realm of dating. And nobody seems to know how to enlighten a person on how to create those social skills. Or why they are needed. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I just be myself?\u201d I really don\u2019t know the answer to that question but you have to learn the social skills.\n\nI suppose the answer at the end of the day, as to how to get a date, have some sex, find a girlfriend, fall in love, is to just meet people meet girls and be honest and tell a girl you like her when you like her. And don\u2019t worry if she doesn\u2019t like you back. You have to move on and find someone else.\n\nBut the belief for most \u201cnice guys\u201d is that you have to do something special. You have to wow her with your uber player skills. You have to have money. You have to have a six pack. You have to be a jerk. You have to womanize women and make them feel submissive to you. So on and so on that they teach you in the dating help world.\n\nI suppose all of those things are wrong. Not that I\u2019m some dating expert at all. But I think that there really is only one option. And that is to be honest and tell a girl when you like her.\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019re a perfectly good person and worthy of finding dates sex and love. You just have to stop believing that you have to play some \u201cgame.\u201d So many people think it\u2019s a game. Don\u2019t play the game. You don\u2019t need to play the game to get what you want. You just have to be honest.\n\nBeing a \u201cnice guy\u201d is playing the game on super hard mode. Being a jerk and degrading women may work. I\u2019ve seen it myself a million times. Every guy I ever met who was a bully and an asshole has girls left right and center. But that doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s the only option to get a girlfriend and have sex and fall in love and find a wife. I don\u2019t know why so many girls flock to the assholes. Don\u2019t ask me. But you see it and it makes you mad and depressed.\n\nI suppose I\u2019m just repeating myself but there\u2019s only one option. Honesty. Don\u2019t be so afraid anymore. Try to be honest with a girl, you\u2019ll see that they respond pretty well.\n\nI have a ton of female friends now. And guess what? The asshole guys get jealous of me lol. I meet these asshole guys and they find out I know their girlfriend and they immediately get this look on their face like they are afraid of me. Afraid their girl will cheat on them with me. It\u2019s really awkward.\n\nI\u2019m not a jerk, I just have a lot of female friends and I love them. They\u2019re awesome. And the asshole guys try to be my friend as a result when they see how many girls I know and I\u2019m hugging girls left right and center.\n\nAnd the assholes and the players, omg they are the most boring dull low IQ irritating people to be around. Their entire life is centered around acting like a jerk to get girls. Because it works. But that\u2019s all there is to these people. They get girls but the rest of their lives are sad and pathetic.\n\nSo don\u2019t bother with the jerks and the players and the pickup artists. Stop feeling afraid to talk to a girl.\n\nI feel like a lot of what a nice guy thinks being nice means, is being \u201crespectful.\u201d And being \u201crespectful\u201d means not being sexual. A lot of nice guys feel ashamed to flirt, ashamed to ask a girl for a date or sex or whatever, because the definition of being \u201cnice\u201d for a nice guy, is respecting a woman\u2019s  boundaries and never being sexual with her. Never flirting. Never asking for a date. Never telling her you like her.\n\nAnd if you do flirt, if you do ask girls for dates, you actually begin to get a reputation of \u201cbeing bad.\u201d\n\nI remember the first time some guys I knew who were all players caught me flirting with a girl. They were like \u201coooh! You being a bad boy now?!\u201d I wasn\u2019t doing anything bad. I was just talking to a girl lol. I was barely flirting she was flirting with me really. I was still very very shy at this time.\n\nSo you can see how \u201cbeing a bad boy\u201d is related to flirting and chasing girls and chasing sex and having dates. \u201cNice guys\u201d reject all of this stuff.\n\nBut you aren\u2019t bad for flirting or for being direct and being honest and telling a girl you like her. That\u2019s not bad at all. And you\u2019re not nice for not doing these things. You\u2019re nice just cuz you\u2019re a nice person. You have to disconnect flirting and being honest from being \u201cbad.\u201d",
            ">I am nice to women in hopes they will, eventually, see me as a romantic partner. And even though I don't pursue any romance with them and just continue being nice and hope they'll make the first move, I get very angry when they completely see me as a friend. \n\n**First mistake**: \n\nWomen are people just like you. They are not rewards to be unlocked when you grind enough EXP by being nice.\n\nThink about it this way. If a guy was nice to you, would you fuck him? What if your mom was nice to you? Would you fuck her as a reward?\n\nBeing nice to someone--anyone--is just something you should do regardless of whether it's appreciated or rewarded.\n\n**Second mistake**\n\nLasting relationships are not built out of just a single, surface level gesture or attribute. To have a loving, powerful, meaningful relationship with someone, you have to get to know them. There has to be a connection on a subconscious level.\n\nThink about your best friend. What makes him or her your best friend? Is it just because they were nice to you a couple times? Or was it because they share similar interests? Or was it because you both share deeper lines of thinking that only you two \"get\"?\n\nWhen looking for a lifelong partner, you don't want some stranger who happens to be nice. You want someone who makes sparks. Who lights up your mind like the sun. Who makes every second feel like the finale of the 4th of July fireworks show.\n\nAsk yourself. What are you doing that would make another person feel that way?\n\n**Third mistake** \n\n\"getting the girl\" is just the first step. The hard part comes after when you spend the rest of your life with another person who has their own wants, needs, desires, hopes, dreams, quirks, pet peeves, hobbies. It can be crazy to try and meld all that with your own way of life.\n\nHow can you do that if you know nothing of this person and only hooked up because they \"rewarded you being nice\"?\n\nThe credits don't roll once you finally sleep in the same bed. The morning still comes and now there's a person there next to you.\n\nWho do you want next to you in that bed? A total stranger who looked and smelled nice? Or a person who gives you zings when you talk to them because of how much in common you have?\n\n**What should you do?**\n\nTreat women the same way you would treat yourself or anyone else that you respect. \n\nHow would you make a new friend? Being nice will only get you so far. To make a new friend, you might talk with them to find common interests and then chat excitedly with each other about those interests.\n\nNext, you have to show you're interested. \n\nThis doesn't mean you become a creep or make inappropriate flirty comments. It just means that you should take opportunities to talk and spend time with them as early as possible and have fun with them as a person. Get to know them. If there's a mutual attraction, you'll feel it and you'll know when to flirt and when not to.",
            "I used to think that if I could quicksave in real life, with enough trial and error I could find the set of actions and words that would lead to me convincing any girl to date me. Yes, exactly ike dating sim games. Well that was rubbish. Some women won't ever date you because you are not their type, and you shouldn't try to date some women because they are actually not your type either. \n\nI'm doing much better since I approached flirting like a chaotic IRC meme chat. I interact with everyone just for the fun of it, and if I really Iike someone's style on a given moment, I ask them out. It can be awkward, but if they like you they'll probably say yes to a date despite your best attempts at embarrasing yourself. \n\nSome quick notes:\n-Politeness is a good strategy to make people feel comfortable, but don't make it your whole interaction style. \n\n-Don't even think about negging. Just no. Bad incel, bad.\n\n-Everyone has something they want to share with the world. Find out what it is for her, and also for you.\n-If she tells an anecdote, don't follow up with your own related anecdote. Instead explore the subject and her feelings about it.\n\n-Express physical affection within the boundaries. If you want to hug her but it's not clear whether that's cool, tell her \"gosh I wanna hug you right now\". That's a pretty safe way to expand the boundaries.\n\n-Don't say things you don't want to say just because they fit the situation. Don't fake being super joyful, or moody, or excited if you aren't. A genuine nervous, confused or even bored mood can eventually become a genuine joyful, cool or playful mood. A fake mood only leads ot other fake moods.\n\n-Dating is weird for women too, but also dangerous. Give them time to decide that they trust you. \n\n\nI recommend this article from a few years back. It is aimed to non-monogamous men, but most of the advice is applicable to anyone trying to date: \nhttps://freaksexual.com/2009/11/05/nonmonogamy-for-men-the-big-picture/\n\nDon't lose heart. I lost my Vcard fairly late, and I remained sexless for a long time after that. And I was hot, so I really had no excuses. It's all in the interaction. It's a bit like the magic eye pictures. For many people it seems hopeless at first, but learning to look at things in the right way is possible and suddenly everything starts to make sense.",
            "Okay let's flip this but let's change sex/relationships for money. \n\nHow would you feel if women started talking to you, being nice and friendly, you started to think you just made a new friend and then she starts getting angry with you and being rude because you didn't offer her your credit card. \nHow would you feel if every time a girl became your friend she only did it expecting to get money out of you? \nHow would you feel if girls just pretended to like you and pretended to have common interests with you just so they could spend your money? \n\nYou'd feel used. You'd feel dehumanized. You'd feel like you weren't being seen for the person you are, for your aspirations, personality, likes and dislikes, skills but instead seen as a bank for women to take money, without caring how much they had to lie and deceive you to get into your account.\n\nWhy would you want to treat someone else like that?",
            "As a woman, I could always tell when a guy wanted to be my \u201cfriend\u201d because he had hopes that it would turn into more, and that always felt sneaky to me. I agree with others who have said make your intentions known in the beginning in a polite and respectful way. I know there were plenty of times when a guy did just that and it caught me off guard internally because I didn\u2019t realize I was unintentionally closed off to the idea. But once they told me I was like, \u201c.. hey you know what.. thanks for flipping that switch because it never crossed my mind that I wasn\u2019t even thinking about anything romantic..ever...\u201d Not even just with them.. it was in general. \n\nIt\u2019s also ok to not look at women as something that\u2019s supposed to be acquired. Focus on the connection - the genuine connection and see what happens. Best of luck to you, OP, and all the happiness in the world to you as well.",
            "Maybe you already figured this out, but many people don\u2019t, so just to make sure you understand if you are acting nice only to manipulate someone into sex with you, then you were not BEING nice, you were ACTING nice and BEING a dickwad.\n\nAnyway, if you want a long term partner then you actually need to BE nice and honest.  You should be a good person without expectation of anything in return except reciprocal niceness, and you need to be upfront about what your intentions are early on in a friendship/relationship.  Like if you have met someone 2-3 times that you are interested in that\u2019s when you should ask for a number or some such.  Don\u2019t bother people at places of work either, this should like social gatherings or events.  Then once you get a date don\u2019t expect it to turn into anything beyond dating, it might or it might not and you need to respect that.\n\nIf you just want sex then that\u2019s a whole other emotional ball game that I don\u2019t feel I should be advising you on.\n\nHonestly though for either I think you need to maybe do some thinking and reading into women\u2019s issues.",

            "I've read a ton of comments, and over and over and over people are saying \"be friends with women \". Which is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT, don't get me wrong. However, I think it's just as important to be friends with other men.\n\n\nI mean REAL friendship. Surround yourself with good people. Find men who allow you to be open with them, vulnerable around them, who offer you support (and hopefully if it is a solid friendship, who ask the same of you).\n\n\nI've read a post before (ill link to it if I can dig it up) that certainly resonated a lot with many of my own personal experiences. Basically it stated that it's more socially acceptable for women to have a group of people, their close circle of friends, who offer them emotional support. Thats what women often use to determine friendship. For many men, the \"bro culture\" means that men are not allowed to be vulnerable around their peer group, that it is considered \"un-manly\" or \"weak\" or whatever to act like you are a real person with real feelings (this is a total bullshit idea BTW, but that discussion is for a different thread). So for a lot of men, that form of social and emotional support ONLY comes from their romantic partner.\n\n\nThis means that the same circumstance results in very different interpretations.\nSharing personal and supportive interactions for many women indicates simple friendship, that she trusts you as a person. But for men it is often interpreted as \"she's asking me to do emotional labor that means she wants to date me\"\n\n\nSocial support MATTERS. No matter how much some of us want to deny it, humans are very social creatures, and denying us strong relationships between others can result in very powerful negative consequences. One of the great things about today's society is we have many options to choose our own tribe. You like sports? Cool! Prefer video games? So do shit tons of other people. Music? There are thousands of groups to find. \n\n\nIf you try to pick a mate based on who can handle ALL of your emotional baggage, you are going to fail miserably. No person on this earth can handle all of someone else's shit because we are also people and have our own stuff to deal with too. That kind of relationship gets toxic fast. That's why having quality relationships with multiple friends, contacts, coworkers, PEOPLE, of any and all possible genders, and honestly any life experience different than your own is so beneficial. \n\n\nFind your tribe. Find good, high quality people. Put in energy and effort to foster strong relationships with them. I truly hope this helps you move away from the \"emotional labor = sexual output\" mentality...because there is SO MUCH LIFE you are missing out on if that's all you're trying for.",
            "Repairing a world view requires recognizing that your view might be skewed, for a start.\n\nThings I've noticed in guys in the position you've described (an incomplete list):\n\n1. Something taught them that they were not important enough on their own to merit real positive regard.  It goes deeper than snotty schoolgirls saying no at the dance, though they reinforced it.  It often has to do with not getting enough attention in childhood, or getting love that was \\*very\\* conditional rather than unconditional, teaching you that you are not worthy of love.\n2. They buy into whatever harsh judgements were laid on them.  Not fully, but enough to create torment and internal conflict, as deep down they know (or want to believe) that they merit love even if they're not perfect.  They also tend to put down girls who are in the same boat rather than finding common ground and exploring it together, as friends or more.\n3. They often have guilt/shame for wanting sex with or without a relationship.  Hey, it's normal! No big deal.  It doesn't mean you are shallow or hateful; it's libido.  It doesn't require or assume that you mistreat women.  \n\nThere's a lot more, but fundamentally, I see the lack of empathy for women reflecting a lack of self-compassion, and a history of no one teaching them kindness.  Spotting that is step one to repairing it.\n\nIt also helps to understand that generations of us female-types were raised to hate ourselves if we were anything less than chaste; that our only value was virginity; that men were all trying to steal our value; that if we have sexual feelings we are worthless trash; on and on.  Please also be aware that it's hard for a lot of us to show frank appreciation for (or even mildly positive responses to) guys without putting ourselves in physical danger -- and if that danger includes assault that renders us pregnant, we don't always have a choice about how to handle it.\n\nRecognizing the apposite qualities in women; logically judging us fairly; logically being compassionate with yourself; and deciding how you \\*want\\* to be are good ways to start.",
            "As someone who had a \"nice guy\" basically beg to be with me I can say this.  It wasn't his looks or nerdiness that ruined it for him.  It was the complimenting all the girls all the time.  It was the long hugs that I was held in even after trying to pull away. It was the \"jokes\" about me and my friends breasts.  It was seeing him lie to dumb girls about things to sound smart.  It was being told to shut up and copy him on a group project when I had a better GPA.  It was the unwanted closeness and touches.  And it was the wallowing in self pity that none of the many women he pursued/harrased wanted him.  Bro if he would have like me for me maybe he would have had a chance.

            "I dated and broke up with a Nice Guy\u2122\ufe0f once. I genuinely wanted to try and be friends because it had turned into a long distance relationship and it just wasn't working out romantically. He was very pissed about wanting to be friends, but eventually gave in because he \"didn't want to lose me.\" About 5 months later, I met my current boyfriend. I told Nice Guy\u2122\ufe0f about the date and he went into full on psycho mode. He begged me to block him, to not go on anymore dates, tried to convince me that he was a loser, etc. He then confessed that he was still in love with me. I told him that I thought that it was clear that I didn't love him like that, but he genuinely thought that waiting it out and trying to isolate me would make me go back to him. Then he tried to turn me into the bad guy. \n\nDon't be like my ex. Take no for an answer. Rejection is embarrassing, but it's part of dating. Breaking up is a part of dating. Don't try to manipulate someone into being with you either. If you can't handle friends, then don't be friends. On the other hand, if they're not someone that you can respect as a friend, then why date them? Be prepared to find that balance and have some balls to ask the gal out. Don't treat her like an object or possession. She's definitely not. \n\nWhat women want when they say that they want a nice guy is respect, someone that listens, and a person who is looking for more than just the opportunity to screw them.

            "Yes. The first solo drive can be nerve wracking, but it quickly gets better",
            "Yes. The saying \"The real learning begins once you pass the test\" is absolutely true. You should be a *safe* driver after your test, but only after driving on your own for a while will you become a *fluid* driver.",
            "Yes. Use car as much as possible. You get used to it.",

            "Yes it is. Cause the only person you can control is yourself. There are idiots out on the road who do not care about road safety and think they're entitled to be kings instead of sharing.\n\nMy advice as a new driver is pay attention to your 6 view points while driving. Ahead of yourself, above yourself, below yourself, to your left and right, and then behind yourself.",
            "Totally normal. If you want some more practice, make a list of 3-5 places to go (the library, grocery store, friend or family member\u2019s house, your school, etc.) and go on a Sunday morning when folks are in church or first thing in the morning on a Saturday (like 8-9am).

            "No. It sounds like you are NOT an idiot teenager. Most new drivers are way too confident\n\nGood luck. Be safe.",

If you get too shaky, don't hesitate to pull over and calm down. Don't be ashamed of it. It's better to pull over and get yourself together than drive like that. I always leave a little early to give myself more time too. You'll be fine though.",

            "100% normal. My instructor always told me \u201ca driving test teaches you to pass a test, you only learn to drive after you pass your test.\u201d Which is totally true, because you\u2019ll begin to experience terrible drivers on the road, and develop your own ways of dealing with it once you\u2019re out there yourself without your instructor.

            "YES. And the only way to overcome it is practice. And it gets worse the more you delay. So go now. This is incredibly important for new drivers to know that driving is scary, and honestly I\u2019ve owned a car and driven constantly for 4 years and have 7 years total experience and I still get nervous sometimes and in certain spots. My girlfriend has just started driving last year and has been probably 10 times by herself and maybe 10 times after I\u2019ve \u201cencouraged\u201d her to drive me in my car somewhere but she\u2019s getting better and more confident.

            "Yes, very.\nHave you considered the Pass Plus?\n\nTry not to let your nerves put you off, you will only gain confidence with practice. Drive alone to familiar places like the supermarket or wherever. See if an experienced driver (a chilled out person, not a tailgating nutter) will take you out not too far to unfamiliar or slightly tricky routes. Offer people lifts and let them help you with directions if needed.\n\nKeep practicing, don't panic, and in about 4 weeks you'll feel much better. Be wary of pedestrians and cyclists, they're not as easy to see as cars but much easier to injure. This might sound stupid but it helped me - the other people on the road don't want to crash into you either, they won't drive straight at you.\n\nLoads of people feel a bit nervous about driving when they first pass their test, don't let it become a \"thing\", give it a few weeks, and the confidence will come.",
            "If you felt you were 100% comfortable (after just passing your test),  I would be scared. \n\nIt is definitely normal to be nervous. It is a big responsibility. As you gain experience it will become more natural but make sure you always remember awareness is important for safety. \n\nYou got this.",

            "Yes, it can fade with time. It's normal, you're still a young driver even after the driving test. I have mine since almost 2 years and I'm still nervous when I have to make long drive travel or when I have to go in new places, where I don't know how to park my car etc... \nIt take me 10 years to pass my driving test so it seems pretty normal that I'm not 100% confident in a car, even 2 years after I passed the test. \nIt takes time but it's OK.",
            "I have had my license for 3 years and I'm still really nervous when I have to drive. I'd rather take the bus than drive to be honest. Maybe it has to do with the fact that I failed my driving test 2 times, idk. But you're definitely not alone.",
            "I've had my driving licence for over 15 years now. Still get nervous from time to time. Like yesterday, had to drive by night to the other side of the city, part of the highway had no surface marking (was it a 3 lane or 4 lane? Don't know) and everyone was a good 20-30khm over the speed limit. Plus it was the longest drive with my baby in the back. So yeah, most of the time I love to drive, but in situations like this one, I get extremely nervous.\n\nAlso, I don't think it's normal to be TOO confident when you're driving a 1 ton metal machine surrounded by other 1-15 ton metal machines. Stress is good. It means you realize the danger of the situation and the need to be careful.",
            "Yes. But just keep on driving and you'll encounter every situation, every idiot driver, every weird junction, you might make mistakes and people will beep but don't worry about it. You'll just think about it as much as walking down a pavement after a while.",
            "Honestly, it is nerve wrecking the first few weeks. Happened to have a 1.5 hour drive within the first week of passing, haven't been in the car driving longer than 35 minutes max since then. Highways still freak me out a little bit, but less than they used to do. I've had mine for about 2.5 years now...",
            "Absolutely. I got my license the moment I turned 16 and it took me until 26 to feel fully comfortable driving. Even now (I'm almost 28) I still get nervous sometimes if I have to drive someplace unfamiliar. What helped me a lot was 1) driving for extended periods of time at a time of day when there was little traffic \u2014 I live 15 miles from my parents (which is about an hour drive one way because cities are...fun) so I would make the effort to drive out to visit on weekends, and 2) driving shorter distances during busier times of day, like to and from work, thereby familiarizing yourself with the route. Even if it's only ONE route you feel comfortable driving, that's still something! Then just keep adding on routes to places you go relatively often  \u2014 to the grocery store, to the post office or library, to a friend or family member's place, etc. Be careful and stay safe, but also: be patient with yourself!",
            "Yes It is normal.",
            "I didn't stop getting nervous until about 3 years after getting my license, though I'm pretty sure it's because my car was trying to kill me",
            "Yes, but time and experience is all that is needed to feel confident! Congrats on passing and you'll get there soon!",
            "It takes practice not to be nervous. Cheer up, you will make it!",
            "Yes. It's only gonna pass with experience.",
            "Driving is scary! But that just means you are way more likely as a driver to be safe. So as long as you don't allow your fear or anxiety to get to you toouch it can actually help keep you safe because you will do all the safe things you need to and you'll stay away from the really aggressive drivers.\n\n\n\nFor the first while maybe just avoid highways and depending on where you liveaybe don't drive between 5-6 because traffic. Where I live the traffic gets crazy at that time.\n\n\nOtherwise driving is no more difficult than it was when you took drivers Ed and you'll be fine c:",
            "Yes I used to constantly worry about how I could fuck up and kill people when I first started driving. Now I only sometimes worry about that.",
            "Absolutely. I've had my license for eight years and still get scared sometimes. Other drivers are stupid and only half of them even know the rules of the road. The other half know them but refuse to care. Driving defensively will help a lot.",
            "Maybe go down to a big supermarket carpark on a sunday evening (or after about 5pm when they are usually empty) and drive around for a bit by yourself. Or do a local route you are used to travelling on/know the right of way/traffic flow etc.",
            "Absolutely. I used to absolutely despise driving. I failed my test twice and I was so anxious every time I got into the car. I wasnt a bad driver (failed on parking both times) but it made me so uncomfortable, I never felt like i was doing the right thing.\n\nNow I love to drive. I find it really relaxing and it feels natural to me. You get used to it, and things that take a lot of focus and effort become almost automatic. Itll get easier!",
            "Absolutely!!! Take your time - dont drive if you feel uncomfortable- don\u2019t drive with a bunch of friends laughing and joking around (it will Distract you)- you will in time find that you can overcome these feelings.   Congratulations on passing your drivers test!!!!",
            "I was in a life altering car accident as child and this caused me to not get my license until I was 18, and even today I still sometimes have anxiety about driving.\n\nI have close friends that have never had a negative experience while driving or riding in a car. Some of them still have driving related anxiety from time to time and other had it when they first started.\n\nAs others have said, what you are experiencing is normal.",
            "Absolutely! As with everything, practice builds experience. With experience, you'll become more accustomed to the road. It will, beyond a shadow of a doubt, become natural.",
            "Yeah it's normal but also listen to your gut. I was already looped into taking my brothers and sisters to school the first week I had my license and I was NOT ready. I was so nervous and uncomfortable and I tboned a school bus by running a stop sign in a residential area. Totaled both cars although there were no serious injuries.\n\nEssentially, your nervousness is because you are participating in the most dangerous activity that humans generally participate in these days. And your nervous system is accurately telling you that its a bad/dangerous idea. So you push past that until it shuts up, because nigga gotta drive",
            "Its natural, u just aren't used to driving on the roads",
            "Yeah. Work your way up. Start with regular streets, and get onto busier and busier roads. The first place I drove alone to was a friends party. It took me a year before I drove I-25, and even linger before I drove to downtown Denver.",
            "Yes, totally. I don't think you'll ever feel completely calm while driving (maybe after years) probably why people freak out when cut off and almost got hit. The stress is \"there\" even if you don't think about it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust go out driving in the midnight, when the roads are clear. You'll get to familiarize with the roads/intersections/passes/signs and whatnot while not involving any other drivers to your process. I did this with my dad's permission/car and I am really grateful because it really helped me help him when he couldn't drive, soon after i got my license to drive.",
            "Nothing to worry about lad, you only really start learning to drive when you're driving on your own.",
            "as everyone else is saying: yes.  \n\n\nThe first time I went out solo, I found it very useful to talk out loud to myself the whole time, describing what I was seeing and what I would need to do about, it, reminding myself mirror-signal-manoeuvre, that kind of thing.",
            "I was like this and my driving instructor explained that it's a good thing because it meant I realized how responsible I needed to be on the roads to keep myself and other drivers safe.",
            "I've been driving for about three years and I still get nervous when I have to turn left on a stoplight with no left arrow.",
            "Yes it scared the shit out of me, this is what I did to overcome that Fear though I'd go out everynight around 10 pm or 11pm and just for about 30 mins drive around the area, after doing this for a month I was comfortable just with handling the car and I habituated to the anxiety spikes and realized it wasn't all that bad , after that I slowly progressed to the road at normal times  and I've been fine ever since.\n\nBest of luck",
            "Yes. I hit a pole; Nobody died. You\u2019ll be okay, just keep practicing.",
            "You won't really be a good driver for a year or two if that.  Just be careful and you'll get used to it.  \n\nYou can also take a defensive driving class if you want to be a better driver and get more knowledge/experience but I would wait a little before that tbh.  Just get some practice in.",
            "Absolutely. It's been almost a year since my driving test and I still get nervous when going to new places, especially on long distances via the highway. The only remedy is to start on small, easy trips and drive a lot. My confidence improved a lot over the summer because my mom constantly had me helping her on errands like picking up and dropping off my sister or going to CVS.\n\nJust know that you will make mistakes, and it will be embarrassing and awkward, but it will happen. My worst moment so far was only a month or two after I got my licence. I was turning out of a gas station and had to make a left turn to get back on the road in the right direction. At this point in time left turns still scared the shit out of me because of the idea of having to judge if you can pass 3 Lanes of traffic (oncoming and then the one lane you're pulling into). I make the left turn but I got really nervous after making it and I didn't react in time to the red light coming up just after. An elderly couple was crossing the street and I zoomed past them at the red light. Thank God I missed them by ~15 feet and no cars were coming through the intersection at the time.\n\nFor about a week after my confidence was shot and I still cringed in embarrassment for over a month. It's normal to be afraid of driving and a good sign that you understand the danger of your car. Do your best and drive safe, and try to keep your mistakes to ones that arent dangerous :)",
            "I hated driving for a while. Now im a maniac out there",
            "As long as you\u2019re paying attention you should be able to avoid any possibly harmful event on the road. Don\u2019t worry too much about it you\u2019ll get skill with experience just don\u2019t forget to *keep paying attention*",
            "Yes. Driving is one of the most dangerous thing most people do.",
            "Keep part of this nervousness for ever, if you can. You are operating a machine that can be deadly to you or others. Overconfidence is not good thing when it comes to driving.",
            "My Uncle said to me, while teaching me to drive an automatic transmission, \u201cJust go. They\u2019ll stop.\u201d \n\nNow, I don\u2019t always subscribe to this motto, but what I will say is that most drivers are not looking to hit you and will actively try to not be hit by you. \n\nIt\u2019s good to be nervous at first but don\u2019t let fear stop you from driving. You need to be comfortable and confident behind the wheel to be a safe driver.\n\nTake small trips. Use different routes. Drive until you feel like you can handle the car. \n\nAlso, read up on handling cars in foul weather and how to steer and use the brakes in a skid. \n\nYou\u2019ll be fine. billions of us drive everyday and most of the time we get there in one piece.\n\n*edit words",

            "Definitely!\n\nWhen I passed my test, I didn't have much confidence to drive either. I believe it's simply because having a couple of months of guided driving lessons with a professional in the car with you is nowhere near the same as actually being on the road yourself with all the responsibility. \n\nIt took me a couple of months (since I don't have the opportunity to drive often) of actual driving around to really gain confidence and feel ready for the road.",

            "Definitely! With time it'll decrease, but I still get nervous sometimes",
            "I'll tell you this. When I first started I made a lot of mistakes and hated the thought of driving. Now it took a year or so but I love driving. But also don't worry I know plenty of people that function just fine in life and despise driving. It's no big deal to like or not like driving. Either way you got this",
            "I felt same. took me like a year to go for my test, which I passed first time.\n\nsoon everything below your shoulders will be passive. I change gears without thinking about it. leaving the only thing you concentrate on is the road",
            "I've been driving for years never been in an accident and only seen 1. Never got a ticket and really it's been good. Feeling nervous is normal it goes away hopefully I've helped it some.",

            "Yes it is a normal thing. You are driving heavy machinery that could hurt people. However, you could use this nervous energy as more of remembering what you learned to be mindful while driving.",
            "Absolutely. I got my license a lot later than most of my friends and family so I was very nervous to be driving by myself finally. Eventually it\u2019ll pass as  you become more experienced. Just make sure you\u2019re constantly aware of you\u2019re surroundings.",
            "i am always nervous, but not about my driving, always watchout other car even when you have priorities because you never know when a crazy dude is going to cross your way and with some times you will spot those moron and learn to avoid them",

            "Lol I passed mine in 2010, I have driven less than ten times since then. Its cool",
            "yeah, i think a lot of people feel like that. just got to keep practising so you can get used to it. no shame in having someone else in the car with you to make you feel more comfortable either",
            "I was the same when I passed my test! It's completely normal. I found that I made so many more mistakes after I passed that during lessons but those are the ones I really learned from. I feel I'm now a more confident driver but I know it's okay when I do get nervous down new roads or situations. Keep driving and never stop learning!",
            "Yes. I got my driving test a year and a half ago and have only driven twice since. This is partially because I have no need to, but if I had to get back behind the wheel I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d be able to",
            "Yes. They say half of learning to drive happens after you pass your test.",

            "Absolutely. I didn\u2019t drive for about 6 months after I got my license I was too nervous. Good luck! It will pass in time",
            "Yes.",
            "Totally normal. It is only after time that feeling of nervousness goes away. It is probably a good thing to be a little nervous anyway as it means you are more likely to be vigilant.",

There are times when im driving and I still find myself thinking that I need to be extremely careful.\n\nIf you're feeling this way, it just means you take driving as seriously as it should be taken and the roads/people thank you for it \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe\n\nCongrats on passing your test!",

            "Yes. \n\nDon't forget that driving can be extremely dangerous if not done with care. Even in fairly normal driving conditions, you're going much faster and dealing with much more information than any human brain had to deal with for many centuries before. \n\nOver time, you'll have a few near-misses where other motorists drive carelessly, and cause you to have to take avoiding action. Gradually these will build up your sense that you can deal with these occurences when they happen. \n\nThis is all from my own experience, but I got a lot more confident after the first time I had to do an emergency stop in the wild, to avoid a collision with a fellow driving the wrong way on a highway on-ramp. Once I knew that I could do this safely unsupervised, I got more of a sense that most situations are within my control to deal with safely.",

            "A tip my dad taught me 16 years ago and I still hear in my head all the time. \"Trust the lines\". Meaning, there are reflective lines (with bumps) that are there almost any time you're driving. When you come to a place where it is super dark out or you cant see because of oncoming headlights, or rain, just trust the lines. Follow that outside line with your eyes don't looks straight into the headlights, brake when you see brake lights, stay on the correct side of the line and you'll be able to see again soon. It's taken the fear out of (or at least greatly lessened my fears of) night driving. Focus on what you can see, and know that it really is enough to get you through, you just can't get distracted by everything else that you can see.",

Honestly, just do one thing and it'll keep you out of a good deal of trouble: Never compromise your attention to the road. Make the habit of not looking at your phone TOP priority. Nearly everyone is on it at some point while driving, Don't let that influence you. It's not worth the risks, voice commands and pulling over can be options for you too if you truly need to get on them. I've been driving for about 15 years and I've never been in an accident for this very reason, there have been SO many close calls from people driving maniacle that if I wasn't paying attention it would've been the end of my poor cars haha. \n\nTry and get a good headunit for your car if you can! They're pretty affordable now and can make your car easier to keep that priority of focus true and strong. That Android auto/Apple car integration is amazing now. Voice commands can help you focus on the roAd and it's really fun to have music apps so you don't have to fumble for your phone. Idk this is all my experience, so take it with s grain of salt but I just know how many times it's saved my skin in the past 15 years.",
            "Yes it's completely normal, I passed my test but didn't drive for about 5 years after, it was so weird and scary getting back into the driving seat after such a long time, but after a hour or so and a few days driving it was like I'd never stopped.",

            "Yes. But the trick to adapt to it so fast is to go for longer rides few times.",

While I was still nervous to drive, it was much better when I could remind myself when I was most likely to fuck up and so I could be extra careful there.\n\nThe majority of accidents, something like 50%, are rear bumper collisions. You can reduce those by giving the person in front of you space, being very vigilant in congestion and around traffic lights.\n\nThe next was something like 20% for right turns -- in the US, this would be left turns. (In my country, right turns is when you're turning across oncoming traffic.) To reduce the chance of that, don't be afraid to take your time when crossing traffic and don't take risks when you're starting out. You'll get a better sense of when you can quickly dash across later on, but your first year your ability to judge how fast others are going has yet to develop.\n\nThe next, I think, was side-on-side -- ie when trying to change lanes and there's somebody already there.\n\nHead on collisions were very, very small, and tend to happen on back country roads where there's one lane each way and you're crossing to the other lane to overtake.\n\nBe predictable -- don't stop too suddenly, if you slow down slowly your brake lights will give the person behind you time to slow down too. If someone in front of you has their brake lights on, touch your brakes too, no matter how slowly you're going, so that the person behind you will be prepared if the person in front of *you* slows down.\n\nYour driving instincts will develop over the first year. Not even two months in I was starting to learn other cars' \"body language.\" I know that sounds nuts, but I very quickly got good at knowing when another car was about to do something stupid and I couldn't even tell you how, I just did. They'd go a little too slowly when they should be going quickly, or they'd drift to the side of one lane without crossing the line, or they're in a turn lane but the car isn't quite in line with the other cars in the turn lane, and I'd hang back and just *know* they were about to do something dumb. 90% of the time, they did.",

But I feel the more success stories I have with driving, the more calm I am. I don't like speeds. I don't like turning if there are cars behind me. I hate trafic lights. And then bikes come from all dirrections and yes. It's stressful.\n\nMy mom says she was much the same as me when she started out. But 30 years of driving has left her at I IDGAF state when driving. She just trusts nothing is gonna happen, and drives out with out a care in the world. So far only a few knocked off mirrors and scratches, but else nothing bad.\n\nBut yeah, pratice. With people in the car who can help you and guide you. Talk about the rules so you get to train them.",
            "if you are in America, no. you should be. they test if you are capable of making like less than 8 turns on back roads...and give you a 10 minute written exam. the US drivers test is pitiful and doesnt prepare you in the slightest for the real roads.\n\nheres your license...oh you have never driven on an interstate before...ehh, its not that bad. just get the car up to 70 and hope for the best. /s",

            "Yes, it\u2019s normal. When you\u2019re feeling nervous about driving, just remember\u2014you\u2019ll get laid WAY more with a set of wheels than if your mom is driving you everywhere. Great work, brother!",
            "Completely normal to be apprehensive about piloting a few thousand pounds of steel.",
            "Yes it's normal, I remember after I got my license the other day I was terrified of driving so I took my time that day. The following day out of the blue I was driving alot more confident. \n\nAs I say to my gf who is starting to drive, always concentrate on the cars in front of you, take your time and don't worry that much on cars behind you",
            "My first drive after test, when all my family were in the car after an anniversary, I was really nervous the whole trip, everything went fine UNTIL i reached our garage, I don't know why, but I thought the garage was bigger and i just scratched ALL side of the car, I felt really bad at the time.\n\nFortunately, after the episode, my awareness just skyrocket and I was getting confident over time. Like I already fucked up, there is no way I make another mistake because of lack of awareness. Having the car hit isn't the end of the world.\n\nAlso, there is something that always was in my mind when I was having fear drive: look ALL these people driving around of me, like, this a common action in a millions of lives, almost a necessity in many of them, why am I the only one that cannot do it? \n\nHope you don't need to hit your car to feel comfortable, try to make it into your routine, but in alert. Trust me they do not cancel each other.",
            "After passing my drivers test, first time I drove by myself, I drove straight into a ditch within 2 minutes cause I locked up. You'll be fine. Focus on the road. Remember what you learned, and relax. Start with small drives anyway.",
            "Completely normal! I felt like I learnt to drive properly after my test than before for sure",
            "Yes. I always thought I wasn't ready to drive without an instructor but my mom just pushed me and said she trusted me and we drove to the mall. When people trust you enough to ride with you, it really helps.",
            "Yes it's completely normal. I would recommend for your first solo drive do a route you felt confident doing in your lessons, and listen to a really empowering song! Then every time you hear that song you get reminded of how excited and happy and full of adrenaline you were on that first solo drive!",
            "That's super nomal, I had it too. My driving instructor actually told me \"Have fun learning to drive, for real now.\" after I passed my test.",
            "Absolutely, just try to relax and avoid overthinking, trust what you've learned and eventually the nerves will go away",
            "It's okay! I just passed mine recently, and I'm still a bit nervous to drive for too long. I know how that feels. I'm sure it'll get easier after we've done it for a little while.\n\n(Congrats on passing your driver's test btw!)",
            "When I first got my license, I remember I didn\u2019t drive for like a week because I was so nervous. And then I drove from my house to the store and back. I felt on top of the world.",
            "Yes it is normal. It took me close to a year before I really started being comfortable behind the wheel and this is in the streets of NYC. The hardest for me was getting comfortable driving on the freeway since most of my time driving was on local city streets and it took me a while to get used to the speed of freeway driving. My advice is just to go out and drive as much as you can. Eventually it\u2019ll become easier and you\u2019d be ready to start eating meals behind the wheel.",
            "Yes",
            "I'm curious - which country are you from and how did preparation for the test work? Did you have a driving instructor and how long? I heard in the US you can get a driving license with little to no driving lessons, is that true?",
            "For me it's that way with every damned new thing I do. Driving a car was terrifying. Then driving a manual transmission (with the clutch going out) last year learning to use a bulldozer was really really scary. I'm actually signing up for a semi truck driving class today. I've drove one a few times and there is an overwhelming sense of momentum that really scares me lol.",
            "Only natural to be nervous at something yours not used to, think everyone feels the same when they first drive alone. Give it a few weeks and you should be fine.",
            "I learned to drive as a young kid (on a farm and in the bush on 4 wheelers, tractors, snow mobiles and a dirt bike at one time... etc) so once it came to driving it felt somewhat second nature.... \n\nNow with that said I still get nervous occasionally and I have had my license for 15+ years and drive almost everyday.\n\nThere are so many situations I think people need to learn how to handle a car (in a controlled environment of course). An example would be having to hit the shoulder (loose gravel) at a fairly high speed because someone decided to enter your lane to pass a transport truck and saw you too late to correct their mistake. (learned this is real life... thank god I grew up driving on mainly gravel roads).... A course like what they used to put drivers through in Canada's Worst Driver could actually instill some confidence (but again not too much because being cocky isn't good either) in new drivers.",
            "100%. Whrn I passed I would make up excuses to avoid driving as I was terrified. In a couple of months I got the confidence the same way you will. Nowadays I love driving and hit the road as long as I can",
            "Yes!  And the fact that you're nervous is a great thing.  Lots of great advice in this thread, and ultimately it will just take time--you will get there.  :)",
            "Super normal. You don't learn to drive until you've got your license and have to start driving on your own for the first time, it's a different kettle of fish compared to being with an instructor who has their own pedals/will step in if you make any mistakes/can stop you from doing something dangerous. Driving solo is terrifying at first, but it goes away quite quickly.\n\nMotorway driving is super scary at first, in particular joining a slip road, as you can't really practice this until you already have a license. However much like with all driving, practice makes perfect. Just drive lots, pay close attention to the road and that anxiety will fade away in no time.",
            "Yeah. I refused to drive unless absolutely necessary until I was 20 because it scared me to my core. But practice really does make perfect on this one, i now drive over mountain passes all the time",
            "Depends. What country are we talking about? How many theory and practice lessons did you have?",
            "Driving has risks and should never be taken for granted.",
            "Yes! The woman who gave my road test told me when I passed \"just because you've passed doesn't mean you're done learning - this is just the first step.\" And she was right. You never stop learning when you drive, and your confidence builds more and more as you go :)",
            "Absolutely.",
            "Yes!",
            "Yes, I am still getting over it. I just need to really gain the confidence.",
            "Yes, and be proud of yourself for where you are. \n\nMy god daughter is terrified of driving and won't get a license. She has two kids, her husband drives but she does the kids pick up and drop off walking or via bus. No other reason than she's afraid to drive.",
            "I remember my first day driving without my parents on my own. Had my first cousin with me goofing off. Took my eyes of the road for 5 seconds was on the other side of the road playing chicken with a angry black lady and she chased me for probably 20 minutes.... will never forget it lol",
            "I was nervous for a bit but eventually you become one with the car, like its an extension of yourself. Takes lots of practice.\n\nI have to say though my parents always let me drive things as much as I could when I was a kid. Go Karts on vacations, riding lawn mower at home and even a power wheels when we were little little kids. All of that really makes learning to drive that less terrifying.",
            "The day i passed my road test i had work later in the day, and my mom was supposed to take me as i didn't have my own car at that point. Well she was out with a friend (i think it was a wake) and went with the friend.\n\nAnyways i smoked some weed to celebrate my road test, but then my mom wasn't answering her phone and it was almost time for me to go to work.\n\nSo my first time driving alone I was high as fuck and panicked at an intersection. Thankfully nothing happened. And did get easier but that was not that best way to start my driving career",
            "Yes",
            "Absolutely. It took months for me to be confident",
            "The first times I drove a car by myself I was nervous.\n\n5 years after that I was nervous driving big rigs.\n\nAfter 5 years of driving trucks, I was nervous driving a motorcycle for the first time. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPetit train va loin.",
            "Definitely normal! Practice a lot, and keep distractions to a minimum when you drive right now; you\u2019re absolutely not ready for fiddling with the radio or anything while the car is in motion. Make sure the seat and mirrors and music and AC are all where you want them to be BEFORE you move the car, so you won\u2019t have to take your eyes off the road while you\u2019re driving. If you drop something in the floorboard, do NOT make a move to pick it up until you\u2019ve stopped and parked the car. Make sure everyone in the car is buckled up, including pets - they should be in some kind of harness or crate when you\u2019re driving so they don\u2019t try to climb in your lap.\n\nTLDR make sure that the only thing taking up your attention while driving...is driving. You\u2019re gonna be fine, but until you\u2019re more comfortable with it, make sure you\u2019re being as safe as possible and minimize distractions. Good luck out there!",
            "Yes, it's normal. I just got my license a few weeks ago and the confidence comes with time. I suggest taking drives alone, with enough gas, somewhere 10-15 miles away at a time where there's not too many cars on the road, like early morning or late at night (make sure you're well rested of course.) This alone improved my confidence because I drove on roads I was familiar with. I'm still a little nervous to drive but I feel a lot better than I did a few weeks ago.",
            "Yeah it's normal.\n\nPassing a driving test is basically reaching the skill minimum to drive. Like passing the tutorial in a videogame. \n\nThink of it as when you started reading...sure you could read but you weren't good at doing it. \n\nWith experience you will learn how to drive like a proper driver in every meteorological condition and for longer periods of time. For now take baby steps and try to drive every chance you get in order to improve faster. \n\n\nAnd remember: on the road everyone else is drunk and trying to kill you unless proven otherwise so be careful.",
            "Believe you're the best fucking driver on the road and that the rest are imbeciles. Fake the former till it's true, the latter already is.",
            "They say you only truly know How to drive 7yrs after you got the license",
            "Very normal! I sometimes think back to those times now that I\u2019m a \u201cseasoned\u201d driver. It\u2019s second nature now. Just focus and relax!",
            "I\u2019ve had my licence for a few years and still never driven on the motorway",
            "Yes.\n\nOne thing you'll find with any skill or profession that requires licensure or certification is that passing the test is just a beginning.  Real world experience will increase your knowledge and confidence much more than an examination can. Learn from your mistakes, and you will continue to grow and learn.",
            "Definitely, what my Mom made me so after getting my license is drive my brother back to college, a 4 hour trip, to get rid of those nerves. It definitely helped build my confidence.",
            "To add on to what everyone is saying about this being normal, it may also have to do with what kind of car you're driving. It wasn't until I bought a new little car better suited for my height that I realized the reason I was so anxious about driving / hated it so much is that the car my parents lent me was just a really bad fit.",
            "Perfectly normal. One thing I've found is that taking drives for fun was a good way to get accustomed to my car, its engine, its size, and its brakes. If you've got a canyon or windy road in your area, just go drive a bit of it every now and then. Often there's not many cars out to be worried about and you get a chance to get familiar with the car's controls.\n\nAt this point, 3yrs after I got my car, I don't even think about driving, as my car feels like an extension of myself.\n\nI still was nervous about other drivers and traffic laws for a little while, but once I became comfortable with my car, this fear went away, as I now know that I can react to most hazards that pop up. For example, I was always worried about mixing up the pedals in an emergency; right now, I don't have to think about what to do (I'll know what my engine should sound like and what my foot should feel like when I'm braking, etc, and otherwise I get a feeling of something being off).\n\nSorry for the long response.\n\nTldr: Drive for fun to make your car an extension of yourself, and you'll be more comfortable driving.",
            "Completely normal. I got my license at 26. I lived in a major city my whole life, and I only needed public transit until I moved out of the city. I remember the day I got my license, I drove my car to a friend\u2019s house and lightly bumped into a curb making a right hand turn, and I was scared beyond belief to drive back home. I was terrified I\u2019d make another mistake. I just had to keep telling myself that I wouldn\u2019t get any better at driving by staring at my car. I only took back roads for awhile. I avoided any and all major roads and highways until I felt comfortable making those strides. Good luck and congratulations.",
            "Yeah, I was the same, its down to not enough experience, obviously you had lessons but one lesson a week isnt enough to feel comfortable in your driving, take it slow and go on drives by yourself, as they say practice :)",
            "Definitely completely normal. You\u2019ll get over it. If you get in an accident or don\u2019t drive for a few months (like while you\u2019re in college, for example), then you\u2019ll have to overcome that nervousness again. But you\u2019ll find that driving is like riding a bike. No matter how long it\u2019s been or how nervous you are, it\u2019s something you don\u2019t really forget how to do.",
            "Yes. First couple times I drove alone to school was scary for me, but after the 3rd or 4th time I was fine. Once you do get over it and stop being nervous, the very next time you drive, you will experience a euphoria of freedom like no other. At least I did.",
            "You're traveling at speeds many times faster than unaided humans will ever achieve, in a box made mostly thin sheet metal, powered by the continuous explosions of fossil fuels. (Or otherwise, powered by potentially volatile battery cells)\n\nIt would be weird if you weren't nervous at first.",
            "Absolutely. It took me a while to get used to it\n\nThe biggest thing is that actually driving is not a lot like learning. Learning you're learning how to do everything.\n\nDriving is more like getting where you need to be without dying/doing anything illegal.\n\nDoesn't really matter how or what you do, so long as you arrive alive",
            "As everyone else already said, yeah it\u2019s normal, the most important thing is that you actually start driving though. If you don\u2019t it\u2019s only gonna get worse.",
            "It is. I learned to drive fairly late (late 20s), and I am still a cautious and less confident driver than my partner, who gets irritated that I don't merge when they would have merged. But only three very low-speed collisions in all my years of driving, with no injuries (one was with a dumpster: only thing damaged was the rear bumper and my pride), so I will take the eye rolls.",
            "Yes. I was extremely nervous driving alone for a while because I was terrified of messing up and causing an accident. You'll get used to your car and driving/the rules of the road will become second nature. I think my nervousness made me a better driver because I wanted to remain safe and to not hinder anyone on the road lol\n\nI've been driving alone for about 6 years now and still get nervous in heavy traffic (a lot of people don't know how to drive) but pay attention to your surroundings and use your indicators and you'll be just fine",
            "Speaking for myself, I straight up hated driving at first.  Part of that was just being nervous because of a new experience, but part of it was one of my driver's education instructors being pretty awful.  I grew up in a fairly small town with not much traffic so I was able to get used to the act of driving before dealing with the craziness of heavy traffic.  You might try tooling around some low traffic residential areas to get used to things.",
            "Yeah, totally. \n\nI'm a driving instructor, and it is totally common to feel that way.  Where before you would drive under the guidance of an instructor, now you're free to go your own way.  You could look at taking the pass-plus or other advanced driving courses to help build your confidence.\n\nThe main thing to remember is that, as long as you continue to drive in the manner in which you passed your driving test, i.e. a safe and courteous way, you will be fine.",
            "Yes.  Heads up when you think you can relax.",
            "Yeah lol when I first started driving a left a space bit enough for a semi between myself and every other car",
            "Totally normal my friend. I passed my test early last year and just bought my first car in December. My mates, who passed long before I did, said lessons will teach you how to operate a car, but actually being out on the roads yourself is when you learn to actually *drive*. I've found that so true. You'll become more confident with time and real experience. That said, I'd recommend previewing new routes and using a satnav at first (Google Maps works fine) and assuming everyone else is an asshole, so drive safely and conservatively.",
            "Yes, this is totally normal. Are you comfortable in the car you drive? That has a lot to do with it. I started learning to drive in SUVs (family cars) but I finished (and took the test) in a 2000 Honda Civic. I liked the Civic much better, and wound up buying a sedan. My first drive in that sedan I almost hit a truck. You won't be the best at first, but just take a deep breath, keep your wits about you. It gets easier, I promise. Don't be afraid to pull over if you need it. Once I was coming up to a stoplight, and made the mistake of looking at my phone. I almost rear-ended the person in front of me, and had to pull off to a side street and just breathe for a sec.",
            "It took me about 6 months after getting my license to go on the highway by myself, and years to look at speed limits as guidelines. So yeah",
            "Yes.  Keep practicing!! Empty parking lots, side streets, main streets at off hours (10am, 3pm).  It will make you more confident and a better driver.",
            "YES \n\nJust keep on practicing in ways you feel comfortable and eventually you\u2019ll feel more confident to drive more!",
            "Yes, but once you do it more on your own you learn more than you did before your driving test! Congrats on passing by the way!",
            "yea, I failed the first time and I was kind of relieved because I was so nervous to drive. After I passed my mom asked me if I wanted to drive and I straight up was just like \"Nope!\" and let her drive home because I was nervous. It'll pass eventually.",
            "This might get lost in the insane number of replies and it might also be redundant but the answer is yes, it's normal. I've driven for years and years and I still get stressed in certain situations.\n\nAlso, a piece of advice, only do as much as you can trust yourself with. Don't drive faster or more aggressive than you feel comfortable with, no matter how much people in traffic or passengers stress you to do otherwise. Don't drive if you feel too tired or for if you don't feel up for it for any reason.\n\nFor example, if you only feel safe at a certain speed (because of weather, visibility, etc.) drive that speed. Let all the idiots tailgate you or honk at you, who gives a shit. You are entitled not to want to die because others can't chill in traffic.",
            "I remember when I first started driving freeways made me kinda of nervous, so yea it normal. Just be confident in your own driving and take it slow. Don't be thinking about what's behind you or what other drivers might be thinking. Just focus on what you are doing and what you need to do. Over time you'll start getting usee to it.",
            "I've been driving for 7 years now, I also work as a delivery driver and yesterday when I went to my friend's house I couldn't stop focusing on how \"unstraight\" I was driving and my heartbeat was ridiculous.\n\nIt is very normal, possibly a safety mechanism the brain deploys to keep us aware on the road.",
            "I've had mine since September (27F) and I still get so nervous when it comes to parking. I'm mostly fine with driving, but when I get to my destination (especially in city centres) I always mumble \"ah shit, I just remembered I'm gonna have to park, I can't just abandon this thing in the middle of a street\"",
            "Very normal in my opinion. When i first got my license i didnt drive alone for a bit. I actually offered to drive her around to get some chores that needed to be done. She doesnt drive and she was a nervous pssenger at first, but having someone keep me company while driving really helped. Now almost 10 years later shes not scared of me driving her around and i cant drive alone without any problems. \n\nWhen i had my internship, i drove 100 miles a day on busy freeways with huge trucks and rigs. It was a real test of my driving ability. And having been done with that, it helped me grow a lot of confidence in my driving and skill. \n\nMy fiancee has recently passed her driving test with no errors. Shes still nervous to drive. Even when im there, but i tell her its normal. We all build up confidence in our own ways. Mine was driving my mom around. Hers will he driving me around. Lol. \n\nBe a safe and predictable driver. Dont drink and drive. Dont text and drive. And use your turn signal.",
            "It's entirely normal to still be nervous. In fact, it's a good thing if it makes you more cautious. Because even after you pass the test, you still lack experience on the road, especially if you're still a teenager. After a very few years, though, much of driving becomes reflex on your part, and then you'll realize you're no longer nervous about it -- usually.\n\nI've been driving for more than sixty years now, and I'm *still* a little nervous in heavy fog or driving rain. Enough so that I slow down and pay much closer attention. And that's definitely good.",
            "Of course! Give it a week, and it will be second nature to you. Hardest thing is learning unwritten rules of the road, which you pick up with experience. Merging onto a highway was the most difficult thing for me 15 years ago when I first started out. Welcome to the road!",
            "If it helps to know......this year I will have been driving for 21 years.\n\nLast year was the VERY first one I did not get a ticket.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt took *years* before it felt more natural for me; years.",
            "For maybe the first year or so. You\u2019ll get little moments that\u2019ll freak you out, but those are few and far between. About 2/3 years after I got my license I was driving routes that were upwards of 3-5 hours at a time throughout the year. The more and longer you drive the better you get, especially if you drive through multiple states/provinces",
            "Arguably it would be worse if you weren't nervous as you'd be more likely to over estimate your ability and do something really stupid in the process.",
            "Tip: Always look over your shoulder when merging",
            "Absolutely, after a little over a month i was still nervous. I had 2 drive my girlfriend and a girl we both knew to get tickets for one of the largest festivals in scandinavia. \n\nI hate left turns, and i majorly fucked a left-turn when some old dude was just stopped and didn't drive when the light became green. It was super busy so i just assumed there was a right of way and then the dude just floored it. \n\nWas super scared the rest of the trip and the roads were absolutely flooded with cars. The city was remapped so the festival had differet location and roads were blocked. My girlfriend is absolutely awful at navigation so it took 3 tries driving through the city.",
            "Being nervous as a beginner is a good sign. It means you\u2019re aware of the dangers and responsibilities and will be vigilant and careful. The worst drivers are the ones who are cocky and overconfident from the start. \n\nIt\u2019ll go away as you get more time and practice in and get used to it. \n\nHere\u2019s a tip though. Go somewhere isolated, like a quiet road at night when no one\u2019s around, and practice braking a few times. As in, drive at a normal speed and then slam on the brakes as if you\u2019d just seen the car in front of you have an accident. It will give you a feel for how long it takes you to actually stop in your car at a given speed, which most instructors don\u2019t show you. Doing this a few time not only gives you a good idea of what a proper following distance is, but will make you a little more confident if you ever need to do that, because you\u2019ll know exactly what\u2019ll happen. \n\nAlso look up fishtailing and how to deal with it, just in case. It\u2019s a situation where a lot of people\u2019s first instinct is wrong.",
            "Yes. I mean everyone should be nervous about driving around over 1,000 pounds of metal though. You'll get more comfortable as time goes on.",
            "Perfectly normal. \n\nBut just remember: most other drivers just want to get on with their lives and are not looking to get into an accident, so be predictable and drive defensively. \n\nBeing predictable: \n\n* Maintain lane discipline. Use the outer lanes only for overtaking. \n* Use indicators before turning or changing lanes. Check your car (especially if it's a rental) to make sure you are not using the wrong stalk every time you try to use the indicators. \n\nDrive defensively: \n\n* Check mirrors periodically. Look out for danger. Avoid potentially hazardous situations by either slowing down or changing lanes carefully. \n* Even if you are in a hurry, driving like a maniac would get you ticketed and isn't going to get you there that much faster anyway. \n* If you see someone driving like a maniac, get out of their way. Right of way means nothing if you are dead. Besides, if you are lucky you might even get to post on /r/ConvenientCop. \n\n> Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake -Napoleon Bonaparte\n\nTo be honest I was a lot more nervous during every single of my driving lessons and the tests (yeah I needed to take it thrice lol) than the two times I drove. First time was in Japan, not my home country, around podunk nowhere in Izu Peninsula on mountain roads with no street lamps so I needed to get back to the hotel in Atami before the sun sets. Second time was in my home country, in a tiny electric car with surprisingly trash acceleration (Fuck you Bollor\u00e9 Bluecar, you sad excuse for an EV), in a heavy thunderstorm with winds that you can actually feel on the steering wheel. Both times I made sure to keep safe even if it means that I have to drive slower.",
            "I've been driving for 7 years and I'm still nervous lol",
            "This first time I drove after getting my liscense I cried because I was so nervous.",
            "I've never been nervous. \n\nI think it's down to how confident you are as a person.\n\nTry to drive positively, be aware of your surroundings, what cars might do and prepare for all eventualities you can think of.\n\n- rode motorbikes for 10 years before learning to drive",
            "I got my license the absolute minute that I possibly could and then didn\u2019t use it for 6 months because I was so afraid of driving alone. After awhile, it will become second nature and you may even come to enjoy your time alone in the car. Great time to unwind.",

Not that much. \n\nA small and somewhat old car when there aren't that many cars on the road? Nervous, but only on 110km/h+ motorways.\n\nA relative big and modern car when there aren't that many cars on the road? No.",
            "After I passed my test and had to drive home on my own without my brother in the car (he's the one who taught me), I was so nervous that I tried to not change lanes all the way home. Other than the 5 turns, I pretty much succeeded!",
            "It took me a little while.  It wasn't until I was 20 and had a summer internship that required me to drive to work every day that I really got comfortable.",
            "You REALLY learn to drive and be comfortable when driving on your own. Happy motoring....",

            "Wrangler and owner of angry pet geese and other angry birds here.\n\nPeople think geese are assholes, and they are.  But they are predictable assholes who understand certain body language.  Here's some advice:\n\n**Don't:**\n\n* Break eye contact:  Eye contact is super important to geese and if you look away, they take it as a sign of weakness and an invitation to attack and dominate you.  Wearing sunglasses also counts as being a wimp, to a goose.\n* Run away:  Don't turn away or try to run away for the same reasons as above, the goose will take it as a sign you are afraid and attack.\n* Be silent:  Geese talk to each other all the time to tell each other where they are and what's going on.  They are freaked out by silence.  Talking in a normal tone might reassure them that you aren't a threat\n* Back down: If they come at you, don't back down!  Fight that asshole goose, or it will be emboldened to keep attacking you or others\n\n**Do:**\n\n* Spread your arms out:  You look bigger and it's a gesture of aggression (geese open their wings slightly before fighting) and if you advance on them like that they may back down\n* Hiss:  This is aggressive and they might decide to back down\n* If they come at you, grab them by the neck:  Geese totally hate being grabbed by the neck.  Don't grab and squeeze, just grab lightly and they'll get freaked out and run away\n* Grab their beak: If you're coordinated enough you can grab them by the beak when they come into bite you too, they also hate this.  Bonus if you get them with their beak open, geese tongues are cool to touch\n* Stand slightly to the side to avoid being punched by their wing... wrists?  They love to come in swinging with their wings after grabbing you, but if you stand slightly to the side while hanging on to their beak/neck, they can't catch you straight on with their wing punches\n\nAlso remember you're a person and it's just a goose.  The worst thing it can do is nip you with its beak or wing punch you, which doesn't even really hurt!\n\nOnce you start to notice the habits and body language of geese, you can actually end most conflicts peacefully without having to fight.  Even my most aggressive gander was a sweetheart if you just communicated with him in the right way.  Sometimes he was totally just trying to start shit to look dominant though, and then I  had to pin him down and sit on him until he calmed down, otherwise he'd just keep punching me with his wings.  What a lovable dick, I miss him.\n\nEdit: Guys I didn't eat him, he was my beloved pet.  He sadly died of reasons unknown, although it was the winter and avian flu was sweeping through the farms in our area and causing a lot of bird deaths so I suspect that might have been why.\n\nEdit 2:  There is also a lot of concern that I routinely squashed my gander with my ass which lead to his untimely death.  I'd like to clarify that as hilarious as the image of someone sitting their ass directly on top of a goose is, I just pinned his body down with my legs and used my arms to hold his beak to his neck until he stopped his shit.  It didn't hurt him, but he was a big boy and it took all four limbs to restrain him when he was belligerent.  \n\nThe dog also used this tactic when the gander got uppity with her and sometimes I'd come out to see the dog lying with the gander pinned under her forelegs with his outraged goose face poking out.  They were good buds most of the time though.\n\n&#x200B;",

It's a cute beach town without all the huge hotels, crowded boardwalks, etc. The actual beach is on Assateague Island, which is a nature preserve. You can pay to drive to the beach, but are encouraged to bike the beautiful trails around the island.\n\nWe were biking along and stopped to rest on a bench that was down a small walking trail. \nSuddenly we hear this weird noise. Before we could react and look, my mom screamed. Eight year old me looked over in horror as a goose went in for a second strike to latch onto my mom's hair and bite her ear and neck - drawing blood.\n\nWe all scrambled up to run back to the bikes. My sister - who was the ultimate scaredy cat as a kid - was screaming even more blood-curdlingly than my mom.\n\nThe goose took chase, still focusing on my mom who was now bleeding from several different places. It was fluttering in the air so it could keep taking head shots.\n\nMy dad jumped between the goose and my mom, GRABBED THE GOOSE BY THE NECK AS IT WAS HOVERRING IN THE AIR AND SNAPPING AT HIS FACE, turned to us, and yelled \"Girls! RUUUN!!!\"\n\nHad I thought about it calmly, I would have known that the likelihood of my dad meeting an early death by goose was slim to none. Terrified eight-year-old me was \ud83d\udcaf convinced that my dad was sacrificing himself to the demon goose so that my mom, sister, and I could escape and that I was never going to see him alive again.\n\nWe all survived, the goose survived, my mom and dad cleared half the first aid out of the local pharmacy to treat their wounds, and we drove to the beach for the rest of the week.

I've had shit job after shit job and and at age 38 finally found an employer I like.\n\n I've figured out that workplaces are like relationships. You don't think you want to get married (or at least make a commitment) but then you meet the right person and that attitude changes. Similarly, you bounce from shitty job to shitty job, thinking this is the way life works, until you land a job that turns out to be a good fit and you realize that it's possible to thrive at a workplace, not just cope/exist.\n\nIn the meantime though you gotta eat so tread water as much as you can tolerate and keep looking for that good fit.

About a year in my responsibilities grew and I was given a chance to be a point person for things 2-5 days a week. Promotions came outb and I didn't get one. I called my manager and asked why, stating everything I've done and how jobs were given to me that the two promoted people didn't do. He talked in circles and I had to train one how to do the job. A couple months later, people that were baseline employees complained that me and someone else were doing the work of higher positions & those should go to the higher position people. Do sure enough  me and the other person were pulled from it and a few known lazy people started doing it. Two years later, the workplace was  all cliques, bad attitudes(or they'd suck up to bosses super hard) and it was miserable being there.

Now they make the same/more AND commission)\n\nSo the week comes for my promotion to hit, I bring up my pay again, explaining that the new wage structure has essentially insulted every bone in my body given the level of work I\u2019m required to put in, so I would assume it\u2019s a very high raise\n\nAnd these MFs say \u201cwell you have to take the position first, then you might get a mediocre raise after 6 months to a year\u201d\n\nSo I start my \u201cdemotion\u201d with pay increase tomorrow!",

I do the prep and the weld properly, because it takes the same exact amount of time to do it properly as it does to do it improperly.\n\nI do this because some day I know that shit hits the fan and someone is going to ask whether I did everything as I was supposed to do and I can with good conscience say that I did to the best of my ability.\n\nGranted I don't work as a welder at this moment, because trying to find a job that fits my engineering study schedule and is flexible, during this pandemic, is basically impossible. But at the work place I am currently at, I still do everything properly. I see people around me not being a proper as I am, but they do get more done, but I do everything proper.

            "I've never had a good job in my entire adult life. I was hired by a Taco Bell manager because he liked my positive attitude, even though he knew I had no experience. So of course it's no surprise when I fumble at my first job..But they didn't even take the time to properly train me. It was 30 seconds of \"Okay, this is how that works.. This is for the chalupas. You press this.\" and so on. I was clumsy and uncoordinated..We were in really tight working quarters. Anyway, after three days of being on the job, I was let go. Apparently my coworkers complained about me. Said I slowed them down. But.. That's a given for any newcomer who's never had a job, isn't it? You're gonna suck for awhile before you get better.\n\nWell, then were was working at Fry's. I had an assistant manager who'd frequently bully me and patronize me. Treating me like I'm disabled. My hiring manager saw this firsthand one day, and scolded the heck out of her. It was pretty satisfying. Unfortunately she left, and a new manager came in..This manager made me work full time hours without full time benefits. This was just supposed to be an easy part time job while I attended college. I asked her to change the schedule but she wasn't very receptive. I asked her six times.  Then I started getting a new schedule that was \"off the records\". Basically the assistant manager would give me a piece of paper everyday with another work schedule that was *ontop* of the schedule I already had in the computer. So I had two work schedules. Eventually I sprained my ankle on the job while doing carts. The temperature here gets up to the hundreds, and sometimes they'd just leave me out in the parking lot for hours. So I took a day off to see a doctor, and I notified the staff beforehand. That didn't stop the supervisor from calling me while I'm on the way to the doctor and screaming..Literally *screaming* at me for taking a personal day. I had to quit. That pissed off management. *\"You will never work here ever again!\"..* Like scolding me in front of customers when I wasn't even on my shift. I came there on one of my off days.\n\nMy last job was the worst.. Smartphone sales. With a young bratty 20-something manager who took out all of her frustration on me, the only male working there. And I'm not gonna lie..I have a lot of issues. Autism, clinical depression, anxiety. I told her that I had anxiety. Probably was a mistake, because that's when it seemed like her personality changed. First she was sweet, fun, and encouraging.. And then next I know, she's grabbing me by the hand, pulling me with her across the store to track a customer who I gave incorrect information regarding our data plans(We cover *every* single carrier, and have to memorize each of their data plans, and costs). Anyway, she just proceeded to insult me infront of this customer. I saw what she was doing..I've seen it before. I told her that I had problems, and she was trying to take advantage of them to push me out of the job. When I made my first sale, she didn't even give a shit. And she knew how hard it was for me. They all did.. My coworkers were lovely.\n\nMy psychologist says I have a problem with authority. Well it's no fucking wonder. Because that same authority tells you that you're part of a family, but then they treat you like garbage.\n\nTL;DR No, you're not the only one. My advice? Go out on your own.\n\nEdit: You know and I get asked a lot why I never report this sort of stuff. And.. Well.. It's because I'm stupid.

I had no experience and little of the skill-set, but I busted my ass, learned and was actually really appreciated. It lasted nearly seven years until the CEO decided to branch out and create a new company. He took me with him and....it SUCKED ASS!!!! I figured it was a fluke, quit after a year without even anything else on the hook and landed right on a duplicate of the first dream job. That lasted for nearly four years...and started to SUCK ASS when the company \"changed directions\". I walked out for lunch one day, went fishing, got a call in the middle of the river from someone I'd worked with before, got out of the river, and went to my new office.\n\nEverything for the succeeding decade has apparently been payback from the universe for accidentally being nice to me for the first half of my career. It has been, as you say, toxic. If it weren't for the fact that those first 12 or so years payed for my kids to have a comfortable childhood, I would probably wish to have learned about the crap of the corporate environment much earlier as you seem to be doing.",

            "I\u2019ve had the unique opportunity to work in incredible workplaces, toxic workplaces, in-between workplaces, and fortunately a great workplace again. Here\u2019s a few lessons I\u2019ve learned:\n\n1. There\u2019s a proportion between your happiness and the combined talent of who you\u2019re working with. If everyone is pretty talented, it\u2019s usually a better workplace.\n2. If your boss gives you the freedom, flexibility, and tools you need to thrive, you\u2019re gonna love the job. If your boss doesn\u2019t trust you, micromanages your work and (especially) is hyper-focused on your arrival and departure times, you\u2019re gonna do the bare minimum. At the job where the CEO watched us like a hawk, we all left at 5:01. At my current job where nobody cares, we all work well into the night when the situation requires and we don\u2019t complain.\n3. I want to know how I\u2019m doing and that means both positive and negative feedback. If I know you noticed when I worked extra on that job, I\u2019m going to work harder.\n4. Your half-hearted attempts at placating your workers with cheap gifts only really insult us. A $25 gift card to the grocery store at Christmas or a cheap $5 hat with the company logo for \u201cemployee appreciation\u201d are borderline offensive unless you\u2019re a startup with no money.",

We've lost 8+ coworkers at my job because the benefits are lousy, the higher ups dont make smart decisions, and the pay is terrible (because all the work I'm doing certainly DOES NOT match what I deserve).\n\nI work at a credit union. We've rolled out shitty products and cut corners, losing our members. We have fees out the ass, profiting off the poor and have lost members because of it.

Started great, loved the job, great manager, and I was able to do a few great things. Then I was included more, and more senior execs started to include me. Then I saw how they really operate, and was shocked. Then I started to notice the people leaving, with no job to go and during a pandemic - either on their own, or fired.

I fully regret taking the promotion. I ended up in the most abusive, toxic, overall terrible environment. I served 16 months and then was furloughed in April 2020 and then in December 2020 they laid a bunch of us off. It ended up being the best possible thing that could have ever happened to me. Crazy enough I still feel like I'm recovering and finding myself after what that place did to me. But I will say that it made me completely change my Outlook on jobs. I will never tolerate it again. No job is worth it. And I think that it's good that we are finally getting to this point because the reason so many toxic places exist, is because nobody talks about it. It really is an abusive relationship.",

It doesn't exist. \n\nI've spent a long time trying to fit in. Generally though, I tried to prove my worth with a bust ass attitude and always being available for work -even at the expense of my family time. Problem is most places haven't worked out because of my eagerness to set myself apart as the most dependable or the most productive. Bosses have even asked if I was trying to get their jobs. I wasn't. If anything, I was trying to make their jobs easier so when raise time came up my team and I would be a lock for one.\n\nIt took a significant shift in my thinking, and it definitely parrots what others have said here. It's all about attitude. I show up, do my job, have a good attitude, and go home. I still make myself available for work regarding covering shifts and answering emails, but I don't generally bitch about my day when I get home. And, I think it's because I showed up with a more light-hearted attitude while I'm there. \n\nI absolutely love where I work, but not all the people I work with. We have a good crew. The new guy is a dum shit person, and a couple of people that have been there before me aren't the best, but I deal with it. Up until today, I haven't gotten frustrated at really anyone in the year and a half I've been there. It's better to be available for your job, but put your attitude and sanity in the forefront of your priorities. Take care of yourself, but be a good employee.",

It was one of the worst, most mind-numbing and degrading jobs I\u2019ve ever had.

Don\u2019t tell your coworkers shit about you or your feelings about shit.

Never mind that day shift completely stops working when evening shift gets there even though they still have 3 hours left on the clock. Never mind that Steve is reaching his breaking point with his team and needs to vent. It\u2019s not your problem. None of it is your problem. \n\nYour problem is needing a paycheck.

And within 5 minutes of being there and in the office waiting for orientation I heard the lot of them talking serious shit about some other people and dragging me into it. Breaks with 25 minutes, but you had to line up to clock out, go to the lockers to take off the boots/apron/everything else, so really you only had 5 minute breaks. I was also told on the phone that we\u2019d be working 8 hour days, but instead they were 11 plus an hour commute.\n\nNeedless to say I lasted all of one day.

Many people have to start their own businesses to earn a living doing what they love. \n\nI'm not sure how many jobs you've had. But if you've had several and there's terrible people at every one, maybe your expectations of other people is too high. If it's always everybody else, maybe it has to do with you. Maybe you should try focusing less on other people and their morality. \n\nWorking with other people isn't easy. But don't waste your time focusing on stuff that doesn't have to impact you. If their choices don't impact you, let it go and focus on things you can control. \n\nYou definitely don't have to be friends with coworkers. Just polite throughout the work day. If you view your coworkers as terrible people, that will probably make it hard to get promoted if the promotion involves managing others. \n\nManaging others is difficult and requires you to deal with everyone equally even if you don't like them or view them as morally bad or unprofessional. Leadership roles are also responsible for fixing problems like unprofessionalism in the workplace. \n\nPerhaps you should look in to working remotely or starting your own business. Start looking for jobs you think you'll be passionate about. Also, start using your free time to pursue your passion. Dream jobs rarely find you. You have to put a lot of time to find that dream job. \n\nMaybe you need to change your attitude about work. If you want a promotion, you need to show leadership you're an asset to the company. Or make their job easier. One way to do this is to spend time proposing a solution to a problem and pitching it to your boss. Or doing something above and beyond. A promotion usually means more money. That money can help fund the exploration or pursuit of your passion. \n\nDoes your dream job require additional edruceiton? If so, go back to school or go part time while working. \n\nYou need to start figuring out what your goal is for your career and pursuing it. Youre trapped in cycle of negative jobs.

            "Honestly, while I get what you mean, if at 33 you've **only** been at places with toxic environments, terrible people, and you're the only one working - well, you're the common denominator between all those places.\n\nEither you're the unluckiest guy in the working world, or you're doing something wrong.

            "Businesses, companies, corporations etc, all know these days how desperate people are for work, so they no longer value their staff. The staff don't have any stake or incentive to make workplaces run well above just not getting fired. Why should they bust their arse for the minimum amount a company can get away with paying them. And so your attitude understandably changes towards the workplace, and so people are even less inclined to do a good job. \n\nCompanies (and governments/ financial institutions) now vastly underestimate the benefits of a happy, secure workforce that benefits from the success of the company. \n\nI firmly believe a universal income should be put in place. An amount that would cover bills and cost of living, given to everyone regardless of status (although it would be encouraged that if you are already well off, you can decline it). This would mean that people who only worked so they could survive, would free up jobs for people who really want to do them, encourage companies to reward their workers properly, and automate any roles that can easily be filled with machines. \n\nSomething needs to seriously change or everything is just going to crumble as more and more people think \"Why fucking bother, when no one else does.\" And that's not a criticism of that thought, that thought is the logical one when faced with the way things are as regards life, people, finance, politics, environment etc.",

The bosses of today want the best ass kissers, not the passionate ones who care.\n\nIt's not about productivity anymore.... It's about control.
