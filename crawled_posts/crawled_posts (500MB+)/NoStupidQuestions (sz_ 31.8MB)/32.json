Did you say...\n\n* **Did** you feed the cat?\n* **Will** you feed the cat?\n* **Can** you feed the cat?\n\n... because you will likely get way different answers to each of those questions.\n\nMost of the time, my partner remembers to get my attention first [[\"You still here?\"]] ***then*** ask the question, because that way she can take some responsibility for reducing out -mutual- frustration from having to repeat the question.",

I attribute this to my mother.\n\nSo she has this annoying way of talking to someone, that makes it very hard to understand what she's trying to say. A typical conversation goes like this:\n\nThe family is having dinner together, and I'm having a discussion with my dad. She thinks of something completely unrelated and starts talking to me while my dad and I are still discussing: \"So did you drop by auntie's house on your way home?\" She hasn't called me by name/nickname, and she's also looking elsewhere (serving the food). But she speaks to my dad and I in different languages, so I can tell that whatever she's saying was directed at me.\n\nI catch a bit of it and turn towards her with a \"huh?\". She repeats herself, but with lesser info: \"auntie's house?\" Now I'm even more confused, so I go \"huh?\" once more. Mum: \"on your way home?\" I've given up: \"on my way home what?\". And we go back and forth a bit until everything finally clicks in my own head or she repeats her original question in full.\n\nWe did this many, many more times, and now I've gotten used to reminding her that \"I did not catch *any* of that, please repeat your original question.\"",

There is a \"theory\" for explaining memory which states that there are different \"stores\" of memory. You may be familiar with short term memory and long term memory. \n\nThere's also sensory memory, which may explain this phenomenon. Sensory memory means there is a store for each sense, in this case auditory. Most sensory memory stores info very briefly, (~<5 sec brief). \n\nEssentially what is happening here according to this \"theory\" is that the person's sentence is entering your auditory sensory memory, perhaps while you are attending to something else. Once you re-focus on that person's sentence, the sentence is transferred from sensory memory into short-term/working memory where it can be processed for meaning. \n\nI don't think it applies if you're paying attention though, since it would basically being going straight into working memory.",

Let me think. '---- doing this afternoon?'\" and then it pieces it together as 'Oh, he asked what I'm doing this afternoon!' but I don't want to seem slow so I say \"what\" thinking I need to hear it again, but as soon as I say what, my brain fully process what they might be asking, then I just say the person's question back to them like: \"oh, you want to know what I'm doing this weekend?\" and I just feel like an idiot each time.\n\nIt kind of annoys my boyfriend and friends, but I can't help it. I tell them I must have \"dyslexic hearing\" just to make a joke about it, but I don't think they find it funny or understand how my head processes it.\n\nI think for me, saying \"what\" came from when I was a kid and never paid attention in school because my imagination was big so I would be in my own little world just daydreaming or drawing. And when I would get called on, I'd always say \"what\" to give me time to process what is going on and make it seem like I was paying attention.\n\nI have no idea about the phenomenon though. I wonder if it has to do with my imagination or if it's anxiety though, because a lot of times when people talk, I'm still thinking in my head and I can't focus on both. If I'm feeling anxious, my head is just yelling at me to pay attention because something is important, but it yells at me when I'm trying to listen, so I don't hear what people say. Other times someone will be talking about elephants or whatever and for some reason my head is like \"Hey. Remember this video game? Remember this character? This person's brother looks exactly like them, like facial features and hairstyle, everything. You ought to tell this person that.\" and then I like come back into the conversation of elephants, but it's hard because occupying my mind is the thought of mentioning this person's brother's similarities of appearance with some video game character.\n\nMy head is weird.",

And I'm not going to repeat it.\"  \n\n\nAfter a few times, almost everyone breaks the bad habit.",

Of course somebody's gonna disagree with me. And that's okay.",
            "There is a difference between critically good movies and fan favorites. Critics look for things like framing, lighting, pacing, story board development and execution, all the technical stuff. When we watch it we can be blissfully unaware that maybe that shot was a weird angle or it would\u2019ve been better with a different lense or the color correction was off. We can just enjoy the movie. It may not win awards but it entertained you and that\u2019s what counts.",
            "Not really.\n\nAnd to be clear, there is a difference between being entertained by a movie and that movie being good. You can have both, but you can also have one but not the other.

            "Sometimes critics are looking at things that you literally cannot see because you haven't been exposed to it or taught it. Sometimes critics will catch things about the story structure, or the editing, or performances that your brain doesn't recognize, so for you two it's a completely different experience.   \nHowever, sometimes there are things you notice or *your brain notices*, but you don't know why, and the critics know why. And that's where the critics should be operating, but sometimes they talk about things that you don't know or care about.     \n\nAt the same time, humans are very social animals, and we are directly influenced by what others thing (whether we want to or not). You're supposed to feel like you're wrong once you see an authority figure says you're wrong. That's a very simple way to put it (sometimes it's the opposite effect), but generally, you are always affected by what everyone thinks.",

There's nothing wrong with either of us, I just value different things.\n\nI loved reading Roger Ebert's reviews and learned to trust his opinions. If I thought a movie was great, I'd read his review of it and he'd put into words WHY it was great. Same for bad movies, he could elucidate the badness and do it with panache. After 15 years or so, I got to the point that I kind of knew when my opinion wasn't going to mesh with his, usually because I'm OK with some cheap thrills or a loose plot here and there. But if he said a film is worth watching, it was almost always worth watching. I do so miss him.\n\nOther reviewers? If they don't like it, fine. I don't care.",
            "As a heavy film viewer I often try to stay away from critic reviews before seeing the film.

I might just love a film because of one small thing.",
            "Art is as much about deep meanings, cultural significance, and novelty as it is about enjoyment.\n\nYou can really, really like the way a painting looks on the gallery wall - or, even better, on your own wall - while an art critic thinks it's derivative, unoriginal, bland crap.  The same thing goes for movies.  They can be very enjoyable to watch even if they're the same re-hash of the same story points as a million other films, as long as they're acted well and technically well-executed.  \n\nTake *Star Wars*, for instance.  It's almost a point-by-point film class lesson in the Monomyth / Hero's Journey, with story so dead-simple it could have been a TV special.  It does almost no worldbuilding to speak of, it's sexist as all get-out, the villains are, from a certain point of view, ludicrously cartoony Nazi parodies, and a third of the main cast weren't even professional *actors* (at the time; Harrison Ford was a carpenter on site to build sets).  Oh, and tons of the now-iconic shots and cinematography and framing are outright stolen from half a dozen (fortunately, good) WWII movies and Westerns.\n\nDespite that, it's a fantastic film.  The simplicity and uncomplicated way the Hero's Journey and classic Light vs. Dark story is presented really resonates with just about everyone.  Despite knowing almost no background about the galaxy at that point, the audience is shown (not told) just enough to understand the characters and their context in the story.  While being cartoony Nazi parodies, the Imperials are still intimidating, and Darth Vader is, at times, outright terrifying through sheer presence and voice work alone.  The unknown main cast nonetheless really sold their performances with excellent acting, and the shots that Lucas stole were good for a reason... not to mention dressed up with ILM's truly next-generation special effects.\n\nPut another way, a chef can make you a plain cheeseburger and give you an amazing dining experience you'll remember all along... but it's still a no-frills cheeseburger.  It's just executed well.  A critic can bash it for being plain, ordinary, unoriginal, and boring, but that doesn't mean it isn't tasty.\n\nCritics aren't telling you if the movie is any good or not.  They're telling you its relative significance as Art, relative to all other films ever shot in human history.  No wonder they almost always sound like everything is crap.",
            "Critics are paid to pick a movie apart at the seams, judging acting quality, plot holes or lack thereof, how revolutionary it was or wasn't, and other technical stuff like that, while any individual audience member might be satisfied with \"I liked the explosions\"\n\nPacific Rim was received to very mixed reviews because it had a somewhat lackluster (and at times downright stupid) plot, but it appealed to the inner 5 year old boy inside many people. It was either the stupidest awesome movie or the most awesome stupid movie that anyone has ever seen, and the reviews from both the critics and the common audience member reflects that, based on what they're looking for in a film",

            "As a former professional film critic:\n\nThere's nothing wrong with you if you like a film critics dislike. For one thing, taste is subjective. For another thing, film critics watch five or six (and sometimes more) films a week, and they are looking at them in specific ways because they have to give a report on them, and often incorporate in lots of context other viewers don't have to when they just sit down with their popcorn (it's not that critics don't want to be entertained, mind you, merely that when they are being entertained they also have to be thinking why that is and how to communicate that to others). It's a job, in other words, with a goal that different than the goal normal people have when they watch a film. \n\ntl;dr: Someone who watches a couple hundred movies a year as a job is going to look at movies differently than someone who's going in to be entertained. If you like the movie, you like the movie, and that's fine.",

            "Critics watch a lot of movies. They become much more aware of patterns and clich\u00e9s than the average viewer is, which leads to them enjoying different types of movies than \"normal\" people. They are not objective authorities, they are simply people who, ideally, have seen many movies and know a lot about the process of making a movie. If you watch more movies, learn more about them and make the conscious choice to think about them more critically, your views will likely align with theirs more often in the future.\n\nCritics have goals. Some pay a lot of attention to the technical things like special effects, some pick apart scripts, some come from a sociology background and want to expose what part of our society a movie reflects. A review is not necessarily a recommendation. Knowing what kind of critic you're dealing with is very useful when reading reviews.",

            "There's a difference between critics and regular people. Critics watch a great deal more movies than regular people do, because it's their job to do so. If you're a regular person watching a movie with lots of explosions for example, you might be like, \"Oh cool! Explosions! :D\". If instead you're a critic watching a movie with lots of explosions, you might be more like, \"Ugh, explosions again? This is 3rd movie I've seen this week that was nothing more than a bunch of explosions going off for half the film. Why can't these filmmakers make something more original already?\"",

I also love the portrayal of drug use in the movie and the crude humor. I dont let others opinions bother me about it because i like it for my own reasons and those reasons are valid for the sole fact that i say they are.

            "That's the problem with seeking out reviews. Reviews tell you how well the product (book, game, film) adheres to convention, and how well it uses (or gently challenges) those conventions. Reviews tell you what the film experts enjoy.\n\nYou've hit the nail on the head - a critic can say a film sucks, but if I enjoy it, that's okay! If it excited you, moves you, or inspires you, screw what the critics say.\n\nThat's not to say you should disregard what is being said by critics (or other viewers) especially if you're a creative. But using reviews to tell you whether you'll like a movie (eg, \"it's only 2 stars so I'll probably hate it\") is the wrong way to go.\n\nIt's better to look at what the movie is about and base your viewing choice on that. \n\nI love 'Hook' and 'Cloud Atlas', and the metacritic scores for those aren't great.

            "Typically dogs are very smart and can often read emotions and expressions. Most of the things you do to your dog to give them affection will be perceived as your love to them. Attention and affection are 90% of their needs as domestic animals. If you constantly show that affection in a few ways, your dog will recognize the action and give an appropriate response. Normally kissing back or returning the affection in other ways. For my dog, it's become hugging and nose taps/kiss. Always seem to get a hug back or a little nose lickin. \n\nKeep kissing your dogs forehead, they love that stuff just as much as any girl would.",

Nagasawa\u00a0et al.\u00a0show that such gaze-mediated bonding also exists between us and our closest animal companions, dogs (see the Perspective by MacLean and Hare). They found that mutual gazing increased oxytocin levels, and sniffing oxytocin increased gazing in dogs, an effect that transferred to their owners. Wolves, who rarely engage in eye contact with their human handlers, seem resistant to this effect.\"\n\n\nBasically, looking into your dog's eyes makes them want to gaze into yours in a feedback loop that releases the bonding hormone oxytocin. It isn't much of a leap to extrapolate that other signs of affection would have a similar effect.",

You see the behavior and you see your dog, and you feel affection inside as well. This inside feeling of affection is then displayed outwardly with whatever behavior you naturally gravitate towards. \n\n\nAs long as your affectionate behavior towards the dog isn't harsh/violent/intimidating/scary, your dog's sense of affection will be reinforced inside a l\u00e0 pavlov. Soon, when your dog sees you engaging in that particular \"affectionate\" behavior, it will trigger his own inside feelings of affection. \n\n\nIt works in the other direction too, with your dog \"pavloving\" your inside sense of affection in response to his behavior. \n\nBasically, as long as fear/pain is not in the picture, it ends up being a positive feedback loop, with each affectionate display of behavior reinforcing the other.",

Your ex got another job out of state and abandoned you but I didn\u2019t. It helps to refocus the conversation on today here and now. This person left for a reason, yes?

            "Americans don't trust the government, full stop. \n\nAmericans don't trust the government to spend their money on the things they say they will. Excise taxes on cars, for example, should be spent on roads. They're actually spent on whatever the government decides they want to spend it on. \n\n There's also many Americans who are skeptical that the government won't Lord the control they're given over them for political reasons, like how Chinese citizens who oppose the government aren't allowed to take busses or planes or own homes. Imagine a world where disagreeing with your chancellor means you can't see a state-funded doctor.",
            "It\u2019s completely different in every state. Californians have tons of social safety nets. Whereas New Hampshire or Montana will have significantly less. We are different in every state politically and culturally. America isn\u2019t one country it\u2019s 50 bound together by a monolithic federal government",
            "Social studies teacher here.\n\nThere are a lot of answers on this threat that range from being misguided to being outright infactual. Including 'Americans lack empathy' to 'Americans hate the government' to 'The US is too big'. These answers are barking up the wrong tree and would be more appropriate (although still misguided) when discussing for example state-run healthcare. Therefore, I'm going to give you a different perspective. One that I hope is more wholesome.\n\nI'm going to assume that you're familiar with the fact that Americans love their freedom. There are times at which freedom stands at odds with solidarity. In most of these cases, Europeans pick solidarity, whereas Americans mostly go for freedom.\n\nSay that we have an American. He eats a lot of food. To the point where he becomes morbidly obese and needs medical care. Who pays for this medical care? Himself. He pays for the consequences of his own actions.\n\nIn Europe - or at least most of Europe - if one were to eat himself to hospitalization like our American friend, then their medical care would be paid for mostly by their fellow citizens.\n\nThis has an interesting social consequence.\n\nWhen we see an obese American in his mobility scooter going through walmart, we don't see it as a social problem. Because after all, he will pay for it. However, when Europeans see an obese person, it is inherently a social problem due to their system of solidarity.\n\nThe American nation has voluntarility chosen to not have such a system of solidarity (or as you call it \"social contribution\") because it wants to have citizens that can be free to make choices. If it were to implement a European-style system of solidarity, it would - from the American perspective - erode freedom.\n\nThe European argument against this is that the increased level of social security far outweighs any benefits of free choice. Because after all, being in significant medical debt doesn't exactly constitute freedom, as it chains the person to an increased exploitation of labour.\n\nI hope that this explanation offers you some perspective on this issue - and helps you understand that the 'American answer' isn't an inherently dumb or ignorant answer. It's a choice. You can find it distasteful (as I personally do), but its very much a conscious choice by the majority of American citizens.\n\nIf you have more questions, feel free to ask.\n\nEdit: I changed the wording of the intro of my explanation, as the original wording was not entirely professional",
            "The same reason you believe the way you do. We are raised that way- it's a cultural difference.\n\nA lot (not all) of Americans have the attitude that anyone can make something of themselves if they just try hard enough. When we see people who are poor, we assume it's because they're just not trying hard enough, that their situation is the result of their own bad decisions, and it's not our responsibility to fix that for them.",
            "A lot of factors. \n \n \n1. American culture strongly believes in the protestant work ethic and prosperity gospel (even though many people may not recognize this). Basically, if you work hard and God loves you, you get monetary benefit in this world as a sign that you are going to heaven (I don't super want to get deep into predestination here, but that's part of it). The corollary to this is that rich people work hard and are literally \"better\" than poor people. We've moved away from this being an explicitly religious thing and it is more secular now, but many people in the US truly believe that poor people are poor because they are bad/lazy/dishonest.\n \n \n \n2. The government never efficiently spends our taxes. Our infrastructure is falling apart. The military gets an inconceivable amount of money and still can't win a war (and shouldn't be in the wars they are/were involved in). Our schools are over packed. We bail out massive corporations for their own mistakes instead of the people the corporations are stealing from. Police budgets go up every year and the police use those funds to protect property rights of business and the rich while harassing or killing the poor (of all races but particularly black and indigenous people). We see this and it's difficult to see that taxes can help actual people. \n \n \n3. Both political parties take bribes from corporate interests regularly. How can we trust them to help us when they make millions on insider trading and \"gifts\". \n \n \n4. Our votes don't actually matter. We don't have proportional representation. Low population states have a disproportional amount of power in voting. These states also tend to be rural and reactionary. However, even when the democrats win Congress and the presidency, they still don't follow through on any promises of helping people and instead turn around and help only corporations.\n \n \n5. The education in this country is truly abysmal. We are indoctrinated from a young age that the US is the best country on earth and everywhere else wants to be like us. So why would we change?",
            "I don\u2019t think a majority of people actually feel that way. There\u2019s an obscene amount of manipulation done by the media on stuff like that. Smear campaigns and made up polls. It\u2019s what we get for letting rich people control everything from politics to the news.",
            "We are empathetic and do believe everyone should have healthcare and a safety net. We don\u2019t trust our government to effectively and efficiently provide those things. We are already giving 30% of our income and see very little for it other than their yearly raises, bonuses, retirement and gold standard health insurance. Not a health insurance that WE have access too. So, you see it\u2019s not that we don\u2019t care about our fellow man. We often help each other individually. We just don\u2019t trust our government to take our income, that we can barely subside on now, and provide for us. The VA is an excellent example of their failure. My father refused to go back to the VA  after one appointment. He gave our country 20 years. Not to mention we, as dependents, gave our childhoods to constant moving, living on base, moving to 3rd world countries, having no roots or place to call home. Living with the health consequences of that now.",
            "Americans donate more to charity per capita than any other country. AFAIK. Social contribution isn\u2019t the issue. People don\u2019t like getting ripped off by the government.",
            "Believe it or not *most* Americans want exactly that but our politicians are corrupt as fuck.",
            "It's not that Americans are against social contribution, we're against government intervention at the federal level. That's a huge difference. The US donates more to charity than any other nation on earth last I checked. The problem isn't willingness to contribute, most often it's government intervention and beurocracy.\n\nI mean, look at how our government interventions go internationally, you think we trust the people making those decisions to run MORE shit at home too? No, we want them to sit in the corner and stop breaking things. \n\n(See the approval ratings for our Legislature and Executive branches of government. The government itself reports 30% approval, 60% disapproval quite often. Frequently as low as 20% and even 12% approval as well. Thats from the Government's own sources, IE the numbers they'd likely inflate to look better than reality hover between 10% and 30%.)\n\nThere's also the difference in scale. The proper comparison isn't Germany and the US, it's Germany and Texas or Germany and California.\n\nThen it'd be the EU and US in comparison.\n\nSo, my question is this, how much of Germany's healthcare system do you want to be dictated by the EU? \n\nHow much of Germany's taxes do you want going towards an EU healthcare plan? \n\nOr do you think that issues like that need to be left to the individual Nation States in the EU?",
            "They don\u2019t. You\u2019re just consuming media that presents a very skewed view of what the majority of Americans think and feel",
            "All these answers are wrong, because they're just accepting the premise of the question as true, and it's NOT true. The vast majority of Americans are fully in support of strong social programs. It's just that the small minority that are against them are incredibly loud about it.\n\nSo the answers like \"that's how we were raised\" or \"people don't trust the government\" or what have you are only valid answers for the minority of Americans that are ACTUALLY against these things. For the rest of us, the correct answer to your question is \"we're *not* against it.\"\n\nSome quick numbers off Google; 68% of Americans support increasing the minimum wage. 74% support universal healthcare. 82% support mandatory paid parental leave. 60% support UBI. We already have universal health care for people over 65 (MediCare) and universal income for retired or disabled people (social security) and literally everyone other than the most batshit insane fringe whackjobs support those.\n\nAnd if you're wondering why we don't have stronger social programs if most of us are in favor of it, it's because the majority of normal citizens are for it, but the handful of billionaires (and politicians that they buy) refuse to actually pass the laws that the people want.",
            "Americans by far give more to the poor and needy not only in our country but around the world. We do it through direct volunteering, church, non-government agencies and charities. Government is corrupt, inefficient and wield control of money for political purposes. Tax revenue is often shifted from original purposes.\n\nA large portion of Americans believe people and/or private organizations can do a better job than government in almost any endeavor government takes on.",

The difference is where we draw the lines and just like Germans we  fight over that all the time.",
            "You might be surprised to learn that the U.S. has the highest charitable donations in the world as a percent of GDP. While Germans give .17% of GDP to charity, Americans give 1.44% of GDP, 800% the amount Germans give.",
            "Corruption, competition, and convenience. \n\nCorruption since most U.S. citizens lack the confidence in government that funds will be allocated properly. \n\nCompetition because everything in the states is competitive, notable since financial well-being is inextricably linked to social status. \n\nConvenience because we are either lazy or overworked, and often self-centered. Self-centered in the sense that the \u2018American Dream\u2019 encourages the prioritization of the individual rather than the collective.\n\nThose are just my thoughts, though.",
            "Everyone that I know, even conservatives to the point of making Trump look liberal, have absolutely no issues with contributions to healthcare, food, clothing and anything else. The three big issues that they have:\n\n1. They don\u2019t believe the government will spend the money responsibly and effectively\n\n2. They don\u2019t want taxes being raised any more than they already are\n\n3. They don\u2019t believe that income \u201credistribution\u201d amongst citizens should be mandatory. \n\nThe people that I know may be a minority, but all of them believe enough in supporting others that they give to tons of local charities, food kitchens, charities that help pay for medical bills, clothing etc. they just don\u2019t trust the government to do it for them without being a detriment",
            "I don't live in the US but I also understand the perspective of people being against social contributions.\n\nCurrently where I live it's becoming insanely difficult to reform and regulate taxes. Many people are moving away from the traditional workforce and are exploring entrepreneurship. Many people are also becoming wildly successful but go under the tax radar because its difficult to regulate sole traderships. \n\nTaxes on income are the most reliable way to tax persons so if you move to consumption taxes (fuel, groceries etc) then you can disproportionately burden say a single mother of 4 who uses more groceries or gas than a 25 year old making 6 figures. \n\nI have a degree and a decent job but I have relatives who make twice what I make owning their own business but aren't registered and don't pay taxes.

            "I'll give a slightly different answer than the current top few answers.\n\nIt's complicated, and it's sadly intentional.\n\nStart with a puritan base for the culture, excess is a moral failing, 'laziness' is a moral failing, enjoying yourself too much is a moral failing.\n\nNow, add extreme racism at the end of our Civil War, the former slave owners could no longer own slaves, but nothing about their own views that made the owning of slaves something that they _wanted_ had changed.  And critically, they still had a fair bit of local power.\n\nIf you can't literally own people, you can at least make sure that they depend on you to keep from literally starving to death, and so the first step was to ensure that they were, and remained poor, and the second step was to encourage the _idea_ that being poor was a moral failing.\n\nAdd in some class warfare, with, again, strong components of outright racism.\n\nAnd then you had the Cold War, all of this was still going on, and civil rights had come a ways during World War 2, they were still progressing, and this really wasn't something that some with power and money wanted to really see _happen_.\n\nBranding labor movements as being communist served multiple purposes, and from there, continuing to label social safety nets as communist wherever possible served some of the same purposes.\n\nAnd so on the one hand, you have the vision of Americans (many of whom tell _ourselves_ this story) as rugged individualists who don't _need_ help.  You have the idea that we don't want people who do things which are bad for their own health to become a social problem, you want them to pay for the consequences of their own actions(\\*).  Mixed well with the idea that when someone is suffering bad consequences, it is _because_ of their own actions.\n\nThen you have the prosperity gospel, which...  I could spend several paragraphs describing why, in my opinion, it is outright heresy for a Christian to believe in it, but that's rather besides the point, many _do_.  It's the idea that being a Good Person is rewarded in this life by God, and so, those who _are_ successful and wealthy are wealthy and successful _because_ they are Good People, because of their hard work(\\*).\n\nAnd finally, you have a political movement which has been running on the idea of 'government agencies _don't work_', with a pretty open plan of 'ensure that the government agencies don't work so we can use that as proof that we are right about how they don't work'.\n\nThe combination is...  Well, what you describe.\n\n*: The problem of course, is that this ignores the reality.  Many of the people who are wealthy are wealthy because their parents were, or because they lied, cheated, and stole.  Sure, you have the people who got there honestly, but at least in my experience, erm, they tend to be in the minority.  And _many_ of the dire consequences that people see are _not_ the sole, or even primary fault of the people suffering.\n\nYou could make a vaguely reasonable case that people who become nicotine addicts as adults these days are likely making a choice knowing the consequences.  You _absolutely_ could not make that argument 20 years ago.  When the industry outright lies about the risks, touts supposed benefits (while knowing the truth), and advertises to teenagers, well...   You might note that companies have been shut down for that last one, in the US, in the _past year_.\n\nSimilar arguments could very easily be made on the subject of people suffering from obesity.  The food industry in the US has had a strangle hold on government recommendations about what people should eat from the _very first_ 'food pyramid'.  Yes, people are making poor choices, but _so_ many of those choices get driven by a mixture of economics, lack of knowledge, and intentional misinformation.\n\nAnd I could keep going, the big point is that a _huge_ amount of what many Americans believe about both how people become wealthy and how they become poor or become ill has been intentionally slanted for a very long time.  At least the last 40 years, probably _much_ longer.",

At one point, vehicles would come from 200 miles away because he was the only one trusted or certified to do the work properly.\n\nMeanwhile if you drive 5 minutes south of the shop, you drive through the slums where people are living in poverty, no clean water, little to no food, but they have cigarettes, alcohol, rims on their cars, chains/watches/jewelry, and nice shoes.\n\nHis mentality is that instead of buying something he wants, he provides for the family and saves up for a trip or something nice for the family, and occasionally he will scrape together enough change (literally had a large pickle jar for change) to go buy something for him - a new gun, a transmission for his jeep, a new tool for the barn/workshop.\n\nBut they put themselves first and expect society to pick up the slack. \n\nWhy should his hard work go towards taking care of someone who won\u2019t even take care of themselves?\n\nHe accuses those people of being lazy, of lacking drive or ambition, and unwilling to maintain any personal discipline.\n\nTo prove the point he setup a program to hire a couple guys who were living in that poor area and paid them the entry level mechanic wage to do grunt work around the shop (more than min wage, not sure exactly what the rate was but significantly more than what they would get at most any other job). \n\nPick up garbage, help move oil drums, help move vehicles, vacuum/wipe out the  driver seat area in case the mechanic got it dirty, and if the opportunity came up teach them basic mechanic work: oil changes, tire changes, brake jobs. The stuff he had me doing when I worked in his shop when I was a little bit older, except I got minimum wage (and only because the shop owner made him pay me).\n\nHis only rules were a valid driver\u2019s license, don\u2019t start trouble or bring trouble to work, show up on time and get the work done, and not coming to work intoxicated. \n\nAll the mechanics were subject to random drug tests but these guys weren\u2019t, they were provided with a loaner pair of steel toes and a work uniforms and if they  worked up to the point of being trained to do mechanic work he would supply a set of shop tools and get them enrolled at the community college. \n\nThey just had to show up and put in effort.\n\nThe handful of guys (20-25 over 14 years) that came through his program all dropped out because they were intoxicated or would randomly no show for days at a time. One guy decided it was beneath him to go clean up garbage that had blown into the yard after a windstorm and walked off with the uniform and boots - instead the most jr mechanic and I had to do it after I got out of school.\n\nTLDR: Dad claims he works hard and doesn\u2019t see the need to provide for others who won\u2019t put in effort. Always points to an employment program he tried to setup for people living below the poverty line that would help them get out of their situation and into a better one, but had 0 successes after 14 years.",

            "You have to remember that the United States started as a puritanical religious slave nation.

Your constitution, as I understand it, was a reaction to ensure that your horrible history never happens again; ours was designed to ensure ours never has to end.\n\nSecond, you have a party that while I do not wish to equate to any political parties from your past, does lean in a much more right wing conservative white direction than I am comfortable with.

            "it's important to note the role of the cold war. \n\nWhat all these people are saying is true, but a larger movement happened at the same time. Under our cold war politics capitalism was tied to godliness. Communism was tied to atheism. This was backed by a concerted effort of manufacturers and businessmen to push the narrative that god wants capitalism. This was cynical on their end as it gave them a way to push policy against the new deal without being called greedy. Prior to the efforts of the National Association of Manufacturers Christians were overwhelmingly pro social services. A boots on the ground effort to provide pastors with propaganda in favor of free market capitalism was funded by the wealthy. The majority of religious people in this nation then began to see our prosperity as a gift from god and the result of free market capitalism. That any movement away from capitalism was also a movement away from god. This is at the core of the anti social service sentiment. An 80 year long propaganda campaign. It was invigorated with the red scares. It was codified under eisenhower who expressed the sentiment that we are a religious nation. The rise of the southern strategy under nixon then carried the political power of the religious right forward on wedge issues. anti-Abortion and gun rights tied to a staunchly pro capitalist anti-social service ideology. Integration required a change in rhetoric to appeal to racist so the calls of \"tough on crime\" rose bringing with them the assumption that criminality is not the result of the conditions a person is in, but of a poor moral character. If crime is a result of poor character, social intervention should be focused on sticks and not carrots. We cannot provide social support as the poor character people will take advantage and be allowed to multiply. Those of good character will succeed under capitalism.\n\nThis deeply religious worldview then provides an alternative to social services, churches. The Mormon church is one of the largest aid organizations in the world. If you are homeless, the mission will take you in. If you are hungry, the church will feed you. To these people someone saying, \"I want aid to eat, but do not want it from a church\" is clearly an anti-god communist. \n\nAnti-communism rose to become our national religion in the late stage of the cold war. Any who supported communism was an enemy of the state. We raised generation after generation to go overseas and kill communists. The USSR was the ultimate evil threatening nuclear annihilation and they are doing it because they are communist. This simplistic worldview then won. Capitalism won the cold war and with it put to bed the debate. Capitalism is simply a better system than communism. With that any social services can safely be said to be unrelated to the success of a nation. The reason we won was because of capitalism and more capitalism will solve all issues. \n\nThis position was deeply popular within the business sphere, who had been funding political action on the right for decades. The influx of money allowed for political success in the Reagan and then bush years. The continued failings of the democratic party, unable to move left under fear of being called communist, lead to a progressive erosion of social services. The money not spent on social services were instead spent funding american businesses. That then returned to the politicians as lobbying. This feedback cycle make certain that no more social services would be created.\n\nThis is why our largest healthcare reform bill was viewed favorably by insurance companies. Our government had long given in to the power of companies. With that came multibillion dollar ad buys to form public opinion and an overton window that viewed anything left of reagan as communism. We would not have this opinion if it was not for the cold war. We would not have this opinion without the rise of christian libertarianism. We would not have this opinion without the financial rewards given to businessmen and politicians us further this direction. Every step on the path was supported by the rich and they paid to spread the ideas far and wide. Turns out advertisements work. This is what happens if you let money run your politics."

            "Here's my explanation:  \n  \nFor most films and TV shows, the goal is to make you forget that the camera exists.  You're supposed to feel like you're actually the one watching the action directly, as opposed to having an intervening lens.  \n  \nA lot of cringe humor is shot in that faux documentary mode (The Office, Parks & Rec, etc.) which is designed to have the exact opposite effect.  You're always peripherally aware that there's a camera- and a camera man.  \n  \nEffectively, it's the difference between watching the action anonymously and non-interactively vs being a virtual participant in it.  \n  \nAs good human beings, we're brought to know that the act of watching someone experiencing humiliation is a type of bullying.  You're communicating your contempt for their weakness just by being there- sneering at them, if you will.  And it's worse to film it because the implication is that you plan to share the victim's debasement with others.  \n  \nYou instinctively want to provide support and comfort- although that might only be a subconscious impulse.  And being a good person, the knowledge that you can't do that causes you a great deal of internal distress.  \n  \nIt doesn't matter that those feelings are irrational to a certain degree.  You're in a state of verisimilitude, where you willingly ignore the fact that action on screen, the \"presence\" of the camera/cameraman, and your own participation in the humiliation of the bully are all constructs of the production.  Just because the your feelings aren't based in reality doesn't make them any less real.  \n  \nAnd so, when those feelings build up to the level where you can't deal with them anymore, you have to pause the show or turn it off completely.  \n  \nGood news, though:  You've proven to yourself that you're a good person, capable of feeling empathy toward others, and that you have a hard time equating someone's- even a character in a tv show- humiliation to be comedy.  Congratulations- you're not a sociopath!",

So like, instagram, then youtube, then facebook, then reddit, then I'm checking any of those 4 sites again to see if there are any updates to anything or any responses. \n\nAnyways, I just posted my thoughts on this in a different thread, but I think this is the cause of a lot of modern depression in people. Phones are essentially on demand instant dopamine for no effort. \n\nSo if you let it, you'll trend towards doing phone activities versus other activities that are less efficient or take longer to get the reward.\n\nOn an intellectual level, you know you should be doing these other things because they provide more value to you and your life. Say cleaning your room, working on a hobby, even playing video games starts to feel like more effort than it's worth at a certain point. \n\nBut on a subconscious level, all your brain cares about is how to fill its basic needs efficiently, so it sees this option that is just superior in terms of reliability, energy expenditure, and reward, and wants to go for that everytime, and it takes actual effort to go, 'Nah, I'd rather play a video game'. \n\nOr worse, you never need stimulation because you're always capped out, so when the option to play video games comes up, you're already 'full', and as soon as the game feels like work you're out because why are you working for something you don't need.\n\nAnd as you might guess, it's one thing to be aware of the problem, and another thing to fix it, which is why I'm here making this post instead of doing something productive.",

            "Finding a new game to play has become more involved than playing a game",
            "**Opening**\n\nI see a lot of answers of being bored or touching on what Joe Rogan said about just apes trying to find our next dopamine hit (thanks OP). Personally I've named this the 'Looking for something so shallow that it's worth belief' effect and while most calling it being bored, I don't think that's descriptive enough. \n\n**Setup** \n\nI think that when you need to explain something in life, you have to give the right amount of information to have a satisfied answer. Too little explanation and you don't actually know, you just accept the lack of answer (Like when an authority figure says 'because I said so' and that that's the end of it). Too much information at once and it overloads your brain and you you start only taking in bits and pieces of the knowledge (like when a salesman talks very quickly and throws a lot of information at you rapidly to overload you and to help sell their product).\n\n**Explanation**\n\nSo when people say that you're just bored or channel flipping, I think they are correct in most cases, but it's not enough of an explanation. I think a better explanation (without going to deep) is that we are addicted to dopamine and with such readily available ways that our society allows us go get that hit makes us search relentlessly for something that will activate it. This causes channel flipping, bored eating, self gratification (porn addiction, online  being the center of attention), trolling, morbid online content etc. Positive or negative, anything that will give you that hit. \n\nPretty much, they world is trying to trick you into doing what it wants by making you addicted to dopamine. The more addicted you are, the more compliant and easier to control you will be. \n\n**Method to help**\n\nNow that we know what's going on, is there anything that can be done? Yes, but you're probably not going to like it. The solution is being bored, but also not going to look for a hit for your addiction. This forces your brain to detox and take a break from getting high from dopamine. \n\nThis can be mean taking a day a week and stay away from things that are elicit an instant dopamine result. This can be things like meditating, going for a walk, writing in a journal, reading a book, light yoga. This also means spending this time by yourself and staying away from technology. So no video games, phones, internet, music, podcasts, friends,  and drugs (this includes caffeine and alcohol). This is going to suck trying to do this the first few times, but in the mid and long run, it's a good thing to do and you may start looking forward to doing this (like when people go camping to get away from it all).\n\nThe method to help was based on this video and there are many videos about this if you search for dopamine detox:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QiE-M1LrZk&t=616s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QiE-M1LrZk&t=616s) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR You app surf because you're so addicted dopamine that you'll search for hours to get a hit of dopamine through the internet, video games, and more extreme behaviors. Detoxing yourself from this addiction requires distancing yourself from technology/more extreme behaviors....sorry for the long explanation, I got carried away.",

When he graduated he moved out of the city into more of a rural suburban setting, working remote 5 days per week. I have noticed his views progressively separating from much of his peers.  \n\n\nSince Covid, he's gone down a bit of a rabbit hole with a lot of right wing ideologies. I made a comment about how expensive groceries are getting, and he just blurts out \"because Biden is a fucking idiot and everyone who voted for him is an idiot\". I commented back that the global economy is a very complex topic, and blaming whoever happens to be sitting in office isn't a fair reasoning, nor saying that people who voted for him are dumb. He just said \"Ever since sleepy joe has been in office, the world has been going to shit, and you cannot change my mind that's not these dumb liberals\". That's just one example. He's had similar outbursts on topics ranging from Roe vs Wade, poverty, women's rights, problems with police and violence in our community, etc. I wanted to go look at a car in the city and asked if he wanted to tag along, He told me I would be cutting my life short by going to that town, as it's crime infested and I'd most likely get shot. (I live in that city).  \n\n\nHe recently opened up to me and told me that he's been pretty lonely, and the dating apps aren't doing it for him. He's tried to approach girls before but he gets shut down/ghosted on a frequent occasion. He asked if I had any friends I could set him up with, as I'm a fairly big extrovert.  \nI just told him I didn't know of anyone that would vibe with him super well, which wasn't a complete lie.   \n\n\nMany of our mutual friends have started uninviting him to certain events, as his overall demeanor isn't very enjoyable to be around. I don't know if I should have a heart to heart with him and tell him that these views that he's adopted making him very unattractive to most people in our field and friend group.

            "He sounds really angry. Anger is a turn off, particularly to women justifiably afraid of violence.",
            "Well\u2026there are two problems here.\n\nFirst thing is that you\u2019re mostly correct. It\u2019s starting to become common knowledge that conservative men have a harder time finding romantic relationships now compared to other groups. But \u201charder\u201d doesn\u2019t mean \u201cimpossible\u201d. There are women who share similar views to your friend, and they may certainly be more willing to date someone like how your friend is now. It\u2019s not that his views make him 100% undateable, but they may make him an unattractive option for your friend group. You handled his first inquiry well, saying that you don\u2019t have any friends that would vibe with him, because his views immediately disqualify him despite any other good things about it. \n\nMy point here is that you shouldn\u2019t try to say \u201cNo woman ever will want to breath your air if you\u2019re a conservative.\u201d \n\nHowever, the second problem is his attitude. His ranting and outbursts wouldn\u2019t seem attractive, possibly even if he was progressive. People don\u2019t like to be lectured or preached at every time they try to get gas and buy milk. It seems he made his political views his personality, and no one likes the idea of such a 2D person.\n\nIt seems like these problems could be a result of his increasing isolation and closed-mindedness. He may not feel he belongs in any group at the moment, and is using his political identity to claim a sense of belonging to something and to rationalize the pain of being rejected.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: Even individually, these are a HUGE problems to fix. You don\u2019t want to accidentally teach him that he needs to fake being more liberal in order to get dates\u2014that\u2019s not fair to whatever girl gets strung along. But even more so, you can\u2019t offer unsolicited advice to someone who doesn\u2019t really want to change. He\u2019ll just see you as another saboteur in his life, rather than having his best interests at heart.\n\nMy advice is to just continue to stay in the back seat. You just may be growing apart from him, and that\u2019s okay.\n\nBut, if you do feel this friendship is worth having/saving, maybe have that heart-to-heart. Focus on Problem 2, but focus on the \u201clonely\u201d factor. Tell him you have picked up on some things since he said that and you want to know if he feels happy with his life right now. Whatever his answer, he may try to blame your friend groups or women in general. But you can tell him that like everyone, he has to make an effort to find people he better connects with. Ask what his interests are or if there is anything he\u2019d like to try. Try to avoid political stuff. Why? Because there are a lot of anecdotes that when conservatives develop interests outside of \u201cbeing conservative\u201d, they\u2019re more likely to \u201csnap out\u201d of it (BTS aunt is an example of this https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/14z38cz/my_qaunt_was_saved_by_bts_i_shit_you_not/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1). \n\nStress that whether in friendships or dating, people like to see others with interests (plural), and maybe he\u2019s starting to come off as a person who is only interested in politics, an already stressful topic on either side when people just want to chill and hang out. But also, people don\u2019t like having their interests shut down or used as a stepping stone to that political argument. Keep focus on what he is doing now to show he has multiple interests, and encourage him to focus on those.\n\nUltimately, you want to help him find something else to keep his attention away from his rabbit hole, but he has to be the one to make the changes because he wants to.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the award!

            "Honest to god: you could be describing me and an old friend of mine. Ten year friendship- he started gettin real weird around 2016; longterm girlfriend left him in2021 and it took a big ole nosedive. He's full of anti vax rage, thinks Biden didn't win, and he's so...just...full of rage and hate. I'm a centrist but on a personal level I tried to help him. First said no political talk, I just wasn't interested. Then tried to just get him to accept treatment for his depression ( he admits he's despondent but does not believe in therapy). I hung in there for a long time after his sisters quit talking to him. Then, about 5 months ago, one day he spouted off that Forced Birth and him not being able to buy the clip he wanted were the same thing. He said it inconvenienced us equally (I'm a woman). I tried to be calm and just go with \"yeah, I don't think so, but whatever\", but he escalated and doubled down.\n\nSo I invited him to fuck himself, and I scraped that 10 year friendship off the bottom of my shoe and moved on.\n\nWhatever. I can't befriend people who vote that I should be forced to give birth against my will. I'm 100% good with the decision.\n\nThe world has lost its mind.",
            ">Many of our mutual friends have started uninviting him to certain events, as his overall demeanor isn't very enjoyable to be around.\n\nIf this is causing you guys to distance yourselves from him, it's not just a dating problem. You should let him know this before he starts losing his current friend group (so he can at least decide whether his views are important enough to sacrifice that).\n\nHe'll probably get defensive and he might withdraw, but at least that will be an informed decision. Other people in this thread are saying \"they're his opinions, you can't change them\" or \"they're his opinions and he's entitled them\", and they're right, but he should at least get the courtesy of understanding exactly which opinions are causing him to be ostracized so he can decide whether those opinions are worth losing his friend group and alienating entire groups of women over.\n\nInstead of specifically saying that it's because he's \"conservative\", I would highlight the specific opinions that are making him come off as unappealing. \"Your views on Roe v. Wade, race, and poverty are a turn off for a lot of people.\" Because they are. A lot of women (with obvious conservative exceptions) are not going to want to date a man who is against abortion. If those views are too important to him to change, then he needs to specifically seek out conservative women who share his views.\n\nFor the less controversial options, you can point out that the way he expresses them is annoying - his opinions about Joe Biden being ineffective, for example, probably aren't immediate turnoffs for most women, but he's expressing them in a really aggressive and condescending way that's uncomfortable for most people. Again, he can decide whether he's passionate enough about this issue to continue talking about his beliefs like that, but he should at least realize how other people are receiving it.",
            "Let him find a woman on his own.  Don't give him hints or tell him women don't find his viewpoints attractive.  He will only adjust them until he traps a woman.  I know because I am that woman.  My husband carefully hid that part of his viewpoints and now we are married and I am trapped.  I have considered leaving but now it is much more complicated.   I really wish he had shared his true self before we got married.  But then, he would still be single and I would still be happy.  He has stolen that from me.  Don't let your friend do this to another woman.  I swear, my hubby hates women...  BTW, I was very upfront about my viewpoints and he was supportive and decent in the beginning.  Don't put another woman through this!  Just wish him luck and send him on his way.",

I don't know a single word to summarize the type of political transformation implied about this man in the original post so I chose radicalization. Maybe polarization would be better or self indoctrination. He has rather quickly adopted a wide range of conservative opinions that he may not have held before, yet he is unable to make intelligent arguments supporting, but rather regularly resorts to name calling. While I disagree with all of his purported opinions, I wouldn't call any of them particularly radical.",
            "One of the after-effects of the social distancing and self isolation is that we all spent loads of time on our computers, surfing the web, and browsing through news and youtube.  Bubbles were built from the AI algorithms.  All the clickbait news refined was was presented in the first few pages.  Conservatives found conservative news and far left Epoch Times.  Liberals found Progressive bloggers.  Mainstreamers might see both.  Bubbles were built, and rhetoric bounced around.  Everyone thought they were a majority.  The race was pretty close, but Biden won.  Conservatives aren't the majority.  The race was close, Liberals barely held a majority.  Far left and Far right are definitely not a majority.  \n\nYour friend needs to get out more and see the real world and real people so he doesn't get sucked further into his Far right bubble microcosm.

Tell him to put political preference on his dating apps, or better yet, go to church or join organizations where conservative women frequent. I find conservatives tend to lean away from dating apps in general so that might be part of the problem.

So instead of pointing out his political views as \"incorrect\", maybe calmly advise him on the way he presents himself in general in front of others.\n\nHell, when it comes to his politics there's a chance that he'll find his dream girl that shares the same views as him. If so, it could work out, or it might not. Again, that's for him to figure out.\n\nTL;DR - make it less about his political views, and more about the way he portrays himself overall.",
            "This has almost nothing to do with his politics, he is simply being an ass. You know this is true because if the topic wasn\u2019t politics, but anything else, he would still be an ass. No one likes constant angry outbursts by people who blame everyone else for everything. Frequent outbursts are a sign of a person who is mentally unstable. \n\nThe real problem here is your friend sounds like he is suffering from some form of depression, and it is probably much worse than he is letting on. I\u2019d encourage you to recommend he see a therapist and begin healthy daily habits, which should include seeing other humans.",

            "Wow do we have the same friend? Do I know you????\n\nI use to think my conservative friend was just a quirky guy from Oregon until I realized I had misread him and he wasn\u2019t quirky - he was weird and smelly and angry and creeepy. This guy friend acted just like your friend that you described except his disgruntled incel adjacent behavior towards women really escalated in 2022 to the point he was getting extremely aggressive towards me (a platonic female friend) and began to get super creepy. I started to distance myself from him and he went bezerk on me and cornered me one night. These types of guys don\u2019t handle rejection well because they lack self awareness and blame everyone else (usually women, \u201clibtards\u201d and \u201csleepy joe\u201d) for their problems. It\u2019s clear your friend has no idea how awful he comes across when he says the things he says. Sounds like your friend is turning into a super creep so you made the right choice by refusing to pawn him off on any female friends you may have.\n\nIn the last year, my super conservative creepy ex guy friend has had falling outs with 5 people, from all ranges of the political spectrum from republican to liberal feminist, due to his bigoted and angry behavior. I think it\u2019s the aggressive disgruntled angry vibe that accompanies these views that turns people off the most. People just get sick of the negativity and don\u2019t want to talk about politics all.the.time.\n\nHonestly, good on you for being so nice despite this. It\u2019s sad to see a friend regress socially. I don\u2019t think it will be helpful to share your concerns - in my experience, these men don\u2019t take criticism well and they will retreat into their online echo chambers. They tend to double down on this behavior when confronted. Their behavior alienates themselves from others, if they weren\u2019t such self righteous assholes you\u2019d almost feel sorry for them. So be prepared to be disappointed if he is not receptive. Hopefully your friend doesn\u2019t go completely off the deep end but it might just be inevitable.",

E.g. I'm too \"feminist\" for them. \n\n\n\n\nYou don't know until you actually talk to a person and get to know them. \n\n\nI would encourage your friend to develop a real personality, and find a hobby other than spewing NPC talking points about whatever political bug is up his ass at a given time. \n\n\nIf he takes an interest in people as individual human beings, and lets them get to know him as an individual, he may actually form some good connections.",

It only holds you back from trying to engage with people and enjoy life. I\u2019ve met so many people outside of what I thought would be my inner circle. It takes all kinds and you need to be open minded. I generally prefer being with people who aren\u2019t caught up in ideological tribalism, ie other people that are open. I think being in a relationship with a mature, good natured person who can communicate and reconcile differences calmly is more important than politics but that\u2019s just me.

Whatever AI has been trained by Google to recognise bots takes into account a range of factors to figure out whether you're a real person or not. Sometimes it works it out fine on its own, and sometimes it needs more help. As for what specifically you've done to make it suspicious, Google are (understandably) secretive about that - if they revealed what they check for, the people who make bots would have a much easier time beating the checks.",

Remember when the captchas used to be short bits of hand written numbers or text? This was probably for their book digitization effort a while back.
