And if it isn't buried, not everyone is going to agree. There's a good chance you won't be able to change someone's opinion and that can be stressful, even though it's normal for everyone. Not to mention the trolls who are just trying to get a rise out of you or waste your time. \n\nAt the end of the day, whether it's a private conversation or a public one, having a lot to say is potentially a much bigger time investment if you actually say it, as well as a potential source of stress or frustration.

            "The number of times I've opened up the box to answer something then decided \"Eh, fuck it\" is pretty high. Reddit is kind of shitty in that it boils almost every discussion down to the path of least thought.\n\nSo if you want to actually discuss something, then you're not just talking to the person you replied to but will be downvoted (and therefore will quickly reach the \"Not shown\" threshold) by everyone who disagrees. You are also expected to reply to those people even if they have banal or off the wall additions that don't really forward anything, the reasons they think you are committing one of the 'sins of arguing', or etc.\n\nSourcing used to be a little bit better for this, BUT lately I've been noticing that many comments even if gilded due to sources typically will go for only sources that support their side/point of view without the balance of the other side, or sources that are pointedly only supportive of one side without context. Then jumping on that is people who didn't read the article or sources posted but REALLY feel the need to jump in.\n\nSo instead of discussion or anything of the like, you tend to get very quickly from zero to \"Arguing on the Internet\", which is the old standby becomes true and then you seemingly even more quickly find that Godwin's Law might as well have been written into the very fabric of the universe.\n\nSo except in a few subs the people who have balanced or very solid sources, experience, and solid reasoning and discussion are overwhelmed by the reddit hivemind.\n",

Often times it would take one person breaking the ice and buying a dance for a friend from the girl he was eyeing before anybody else got a dance.\n\nMost the time it was just a fun place to go because the music was bangin, we could get fucked up together and there were always chicks wearing skimpy outfits or nothing at all walking around.\n\nNow that I'm a bit older and me and the boys have kinda gotten busy with life and relationships, it has lost its appeal to me pretty much completely. Lol \n\nI can get drunk, listen to bangin music and score at home for free lol",

Some people genuinely enjoy watching women dance naked. They aren't necessarily going there to get all 'hot and bothered'",
            "It depends on the person and strip club. if you like it you like it if you don\u2019t you don\u2019t. For instance, a scumbag may like a low-end strip club due to their lack of security and inexperienced strippers, but I think most (good) people find environments like that unsettling and gross.\n\nMy general understanding is that in some parts of the US it can be treated like a normal club, a social outing where you can flex your wealth and have the company of beautiful women. If a guy wants the attention of a woman at a typical club, he generally can\u2019t just throw money towards a random girl and have her entertain him and his buddies (that could be very insulting). Along with that, strippers are human, they could be attracted to a customer, and the prospect of being the person to bring them home *for free* is probably enticing. Also, spank bank.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m a straight woman and I want to go to a *fancy* strip club with female strippers for the spectacle: the charisma, the dancing, their performance of sexuality and their bodies. I want to see women commodifying their sexuality without having sex, I want to see how they entice, their charm, their athleticism (pole dancing especially), and I want to see the variety of women\u2019s bodies IRL. \n\nLastly, I particularly want to go to a strip club in Atlanta not only because they have well established businesses but because its reported that some rappers will play their unreleased music in strip clubs and gauge whether the song is a banger based on the strippers\u2019 enthusiasm dancing. I would love to witness that and I love that strippers may have a say in music. While they don\u2019t create the music, they are trained to physically emphasize music and it\u2019s an interesting idea to have them critique it through dance. It\u2019s just cool.",
            "I\u2019ve only ever been to one specific strip club, and it was a really high end one that NFL players frequented in Green Bay. I never really enjoyed it (I mean, boobs are awesome don\u2019t get me wrong). It was ridiculously expensive just to be there for a few hours- cover charge just to get in, crazy expensive drinks that you\u2019re made to always have one, having to tip the bathroom butler, tipping the dancers\u2026 that stacks up quickly.\n\nI just think it\u2019s too hard to see through the veil that they\u2019re not attracted to you. I think some people can put the blinders on and enjoy that fantasy or whatever. Additionally, I think some people get off on the power dynamics- \u201cyeah, take your clothes off and I\u2019ll give you a few dollars.\u201d They feel superior to the girls and that makes them feel better about themselves. I wonder what pathetic life some men are returning to at the end of the night when the girls are in the back room counting the thousands of dollars they earned that night\u2026\n\nFor me, the appeal hasn\u2019t ever been there. I like to get my boob experiences the old fashioned way- by dating a woman.",

But your friend took a dance and you don\u2019t know how long he will be, so you get another drink to not seem weird. Then tits McGee comes out and your like, oh whoa she looks amazing and then you realize the crowd of homeless looking men that somehow got into the club spending their entire paycheck in about 5 minutes and you\u2019re fascinated by the depravity in their eyes as they howl and lose their shit for a thicc whie girl who\u2019s probably 20 and they\u2019re clearly 40-50 years of age. \n\nThen you notice everyone is pretty much 40-50. And you have a deep long introspective at your life and realize maybe marriage isn\u2019t great, maybe there\u2019s a larger relationship and mental health crisis than anyone wants to admit people just cover it up with sneaking to the club for titties and beer or drugs or video games or any means of escape they seek out. \n\nThen you realize some girl was dancing on you as you sunk into that abyss and two hours has gone by and your friend went gone and now you\u2019re out $300+ and finally just get up and leave. \n\nAnd then you go home and wash yourself and brush your teeth because that one girls breath has you paranoid about dental health. \n\nThat\u2019s the appeal",
            "Went to a strip club once with an acquaintance. You can't hear anyone and hot people pretend to like you. I even spent money for a private lap dance and I couldn't get aroused or excited. I wanted to leave. \n\nI don't judge people who find enjoyment out of it, but I personally cannot get past the \"pay someone to pretend to like you\" aspect, and it doesn't help to be in a loud, unusual environment when you're an introvert.",

            "One answer is that a lot of people are lonely and a strip club is the closest they\u2019re ever going to get to seeing women that young and attractive naked in person. Sometimes these women are the only attractive people that ever *speak* to them.\n\nAnother answer is that a lot of people go in groups because it\u2019s basically no different than a bar. There are just naked girls everywhere. It\u2019s a fun environment and most people in groups aren\u2019t really getting *that* hot and bothered.\n\nIf you\u2019re getting so horny at a strip club that you find it unfulfilling to just go home after, you\u2019re probably missing the point. This may seem like a strange thing to say, but it\u2019s not like porn. It\u2019s just a show. Like how there\u2019s nudity involved in burlesque shows, but the point isn\u2019t really to get you all hot and bothered. It\u2019s just a show.\n\nEdit: You\u2019re basically asking what the point of looking at hot women is if you can\u2019t get off. But you know how sometimes you see a pretty girl going about her business around town? Maybe passed her walking on the street? She doesn\u2019t need to get you off for you to enjoy looking at her. You just take a glance, don\u2019t stare, enjoy it, and move on with your day. That\u2019s it. There doesn\u2019t have to be more to every single encounter in order for you to enjoy seeing a pretty girl.",

Its not something you do often.\n\nFor some dudes its a warm up. Before going home to their SO they will get the engine started so to say.\n\nFor some dudes its a challenge. Not all strippers offer extracarricular activities. Some do, some clubs even promote it secretly. But many are just women doing a job. There are guys who get their jollies by convincing these women to perform sexual acts or sell their bodies.\n\nFor some dudes its just a way to connect with a woman. There are men who are socially awkward or lack confidence or simply have given up on relationships. These dudes find a sort of comfort in just having a friendly relationship with one or more local strippers. Its generally called the Girlfriend Experience. Its offered by prostitutes as well. It doesnt always include sex. Generally a man will pay an escort/prostitute/stripper to spend time with them. Watch a movie/netflix, eat dinner together, maybe go out, cuddle in bed or speak sweet nothings.",

            "I worked with a friend on a project about strip clubs for over a year. We met and interviewed hundreds of people; women who work there, men who visit, and people who own the places. \n\nThere are several reasons, not all related:\n\n\u2022 There's always a demographic of men who want to just pay and have naked, or half-naked, women around. The bachelor party crowd is one example of this type. These are mostly young, white men who feel that feminists have spoiled the fun for them. They just want to be able to cop a feel and stroke some ass without being slapped in the face or being fired from their job. It is a safe place for them to play out their sexual fantasies.\n\n\u2022 Then there are the lonely guys. Sometimes they are married. They mostly want to feel \"attractive\" to women, even if they have to pay for it. In interviewing strippers we learned that the most effective technique is to find something that is remotely good about the guy and harp on it. (Never lie completely.) Like, \"You have such beautiful eyes\" etc. It may sound stupid when you read this, but it works every time. In many cases, all they want is a woman to tell them that they are sexy and irresistible. You would think paying good money would make this idea absurd. But it does not. Just like a massage feels good, even though you are paying for it and the person giving the massage may not really \"mean it.\"\n\n\u2022 There is always a small element of thrill-seekers, like married couples, who come around to experience a kind of \"threesome\" dynamic. They say it adds a bit of spice to their marriage.\n\n\u2022 In some cases the \"strip clubs\" we went to were not even \"strip clubs.\" No nudity was allowed and any kind of physical contact was forbidden. At first, we could not figure out why men would go to these places and ask for private dances for as much as $45 for a single song of 4 minutes. But it was to relieve loneliness. A lot of it was talk and flirtation with a sexy woman, that is all.\n\n\u2022 Last, and in no way least, there are men who get laid in these places. Most all clubs strictly forbid any sexual activity and meeting a client outside of the club is a big no-no. But the men going there and the women working there are human and sexual contact is not uncommon. Women have regulars and after a few visits, they trust them enough to let the men touch them. etc.\n\nLoneliness is a human condition and despite all efforts to get rid of the strip clubs, they survive because men are happy to pay money to relieve their loneliness, even if for a few minutes. \n\nThe entire thing struck me as all very human. By the end of the project whatever prejudices I had about strip clubs were proven false. I came away admiring the women for their strength and feeling sorry for the men for their loneliness.",
            "I\u2019m 61, I can count on one hand the number of times I\u2019ve been to a strip club.  Without wanting to offend those who do work in strip clubs, I honestly can\u2019t stomach giving someone money to shake their tits and ass in front of me, not to mention the high cover charge cost and even pricier drinks.  But hey, everyone has their own reasons for going and I\u2019m not going to knock anyone for that, just no my thing I guess.",

She practically ripped my clothes off when we got back to the hotel room.  When I used to go to (female) strip joints, by myself, I told her beforehand and, again, she\u2019d rip my clothes off when I got home, just thinking about me being around naked women.\n\n*Curiosity*, the act that got her the hottest (and most of the women in the audience too) was a rather handsome guy who started naked on the stage and slowly danced while dressing in a tux.

I stopped going because I realized something about myself at that young age: I am a lonely, awkward/shy, insecure sack of shit.\n\n And every time I went to a strip club, I fell in love with one of the girls. In the moment, it felt mutual. But then when I was going home alone at the end of the night after spending a lot of money on one lady's affection, I realized it was all a game. \n\nI didn't blame the women at all.

            "[Wikipedia Gives the best amswer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_bra)\n\n>Training bras and the age at which girls first wear bras is sometimes controversial. Some people regard training bras as a way to sexualize young girls, and that training bras serve no functional purpose, that businesses benefit financially from, and even encourage, precocious sexuality in girls by exploiting their fears about self-image and social norms.[10] Still, others recognize developing tissue in breasts as sensitive and, at times, needing cover to maintain comfort, even if only psychological, for the wearer.[24]\n\nBra opponents believe that training bras are used to indoctrinate girls into thinking about their breasts as sexual objects. In their view, bras are not functional undergarments but simply exist to make the body more sexually appealing.[25] They believe that training bras exploit young girls and encourage precocious sexuality.[26]\n\nTL;DR training bras are a superfluous piece of clothing that exist for no reason than for companies to make money.",

She has no growth yet but it covers her chest, makes her feel more grown-up and modest, and will help when they do start to grow soon.

            "A few different things. The primary reason young girls wear training bras is to help familiarize them with the way a bra is put on and taken off, allowing them to get used to their preferred method before it\u2019s of any significant importance. Another reason is that a girl\u2019s chest may be tender or prone to chafing during early development and the close-fitting fabric of a training bra can reduce (shockingly painful) nipple chafing. Another reason is to serve as a rite of passage\u2014a girl\u2019s first bra is a big deal and having one helps a young girl feel more grown up and independent, as other rites of passage for children do. Training bras typically begin to be worn by girls in their late elementary school years or at the beginning of middle school (about 5th or 6th grade). Middle school is when they become most common because this is when students often begin changing for PE in a locker room with other students and a bra allows for a small degree of modesty.",

THE MOST IMPORTANT REASON- SUBREDDITS\n\nReddit is divided into subreddits.People (some like me) who dont browse it like Facebook or 9gag or instagram or twitter where the sections are all piled into a single stream of continuous content, but rather people who go to separate subs to check out whats new.\n\nEDIT: ~~4.)

            "Really minor reason that only hits part of the question: generations click differently. Tiktok's audience is mainly like 10-20 olds I think? This generation has been taught to press likes more than us old plebs.\n\nI have this theory that on youtube you can look at like/view ratio and figure out that more likes there are per view, younger the audience is. You pretty much can't become a 20M+ sub youtuber without young people in your audience. But then there are channels with much older demographic, podcasts come to mind. Holy shit is the like/view ratio different? It's across the board same for any podcast I watch, 1M video having 10k likes can be default. Old geeks just aren't respecting the importance of likes as that wasn't part of growing up. Compare that, to [this](https://i.imgur.com/WMcVbBw.png). I wouldn't even say that kids upvote more, the world of likes has been up for a long time so 20-25s are probably up to speed already.\n\nTop comment probably answers the question more precisely, but I think this is worthy topic too. It's not just youtube, every platform should be the same. Even just on reddit there are subs that definitely have younger audience. Just look at /r/pewdiepiesubmissions and how high the likes get. Just from last 24hrs I see 46k, 35k and 23k posts. It's big sub, but not THAT big. Votes wouldn't look like that on 3.5M subreddit where avg. age was 30.",

This leads to the upvotes effectively being split between potentially dozens of posts. And then people may downvote each of the reposts they see, therein potentially counteracting as many upvotes as their are reposts, drastically reducing upvotes on any particular post even more.\n\nOverall reddit isn't designed for reaching those numbers.",

Some people see Reddit as this big, intimidating, hard to understand mess. Others see it as a place with so many different communities of varying (and specific) sorts that it scares them to know they could relatively easily find some fucked up shit. And many of the people who don't fall into either of those categories have just never seen something Reddit does that entices them enough to come in, whether they already see enough of it from other places or they just don't like the features much.\n\nThe people left after all that are us. The Redditors. It's a relatively mainstream name, but the contents of it are rather niche if you look at *anything* under the absolute surface level. Most people don't know much more than r/Showerthoughts or r/AskReddit or r/NoStupidQuestions.

On YouTube you'll see a trending video, but on reddit your homepage is just posts from subs you've joined, and the sidebar is trending communities and not posts.\n\nThis means that a lot of the most upvoted and awarded content is in niche communities rather than viral posts everybody knows about or sees.

            "The explanation they give in the first book is: \"But his [Pooh's] arms were so stiff from holding on to the string of the balloon all the time that they stayed up straight in the air for more than a week, and whenever a fly came and settled on his nose he had to blow it off. And I think, but I am not sure, that that is why he was always called Pooh.\"\n\nSo basically is the sound he made when he blew at his nose.",
            "Winnie was a real bear that a Canadian officer found in during WW1. He named her Winnie after his  hometown, Winnipeg. When he came to England with his unit, he brought the bear with him but ended up leaving her at the London Zoo. Christopher Robin visited the zoo with his father and fell in love with Winnie and renamed his bear, Edward after her. Apparently there was a swan at the same zoo called Pooh because of her um ... toilet habits and Christopher added that in to remember her by. Or that's one story.\n\nHowever, in the movie Goodbye Christopher Robin it's slightly different. Christopher tells his father he wants to rename Edward to Winnie but was worried that people wouldn't understand that Winnie was a boy bear (Winnie was a popular ladies name in England) so Milne suggests he add 'Pooh' to Winnie's name. When Christopher asks why, Milne says something like \"So if someone says that's a boy bear with a girl's name, you can just say 'Pooh!'\" which in Britain was a word used to express disbelief/disdain/dismissal.",
            "Other people have good factual answers about the real reason why he's \"Winnie\", but the answer to your actual questions is found in the books themselves, if you have them. In fact there's more than one canon answer, though they all amount to one thing: his name is Winnie the Pooh, and that's how we refer to him, and that's how it is.\n\n**Here's one excerpt:**\n\n\"when Edward Bear said that he would like an exciting name all to himself, Christopher Robin said at once, without stopping to think, that he was Winnie-the-Pooh.\"\n\n**Here's another:**\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nIn Which\n\nWe Are Introduced to Winnie-the-Pooh and Some Bees, and the Stories Begin\n\nHere is Edward Bear, coming down the stairs now, bump, bump, bump, on the back of his head, behind Christopher Robin. It is, as far as he knows, the only way of coming downstairs, but sometimes he feels that there really is another way, if only he could stop bumping for a moment and think of it. And then he feels that perhaps there isn\u2019t. Anyhow, here he is at the bottom, and ready to be introduced to you. Winnie-the-Pooh.\n\nWhen I first heard his name, I said, just as you are going to say, \u201cBut I thought that he was a boy?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo did I,\u201d said Christopher Robin.\n\n\u201cThen you can\u2019t call him Winnie?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you said . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s Winnie-ther-Pooh.Don\u2019t you know what \u2018ther\u2019 means?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, yes, now I do,\u201d I said quickly; and I hope you do too, because that is all the explanation that you are going to get.",

Well, when Edward Bear said that he would like an exciting name all to himself, Christopher Robin said at once, without stopping to think, that he was Winnie-the-Pooh. And he was.\u201d\n\nLong paragraph about Christopher Robin going to the London zoo to visit a polar bear\u2014it\u2019s charming, go read it\u2014 \u201c...now this bear\u2019s name is Winnie, which shows what a good name for bears it is, but the funny thing is that we can\u2019t remember whether Winnie is called after Pooh, or Pooh after Winnie. We did know once, but we have forgotten...\u201d\n\nSo Winnie the Pooh is a nickname for a bear named Edward Bear, and he gets this nickname from two other animals\u2014a swan and a polar bear. That\u2019s clear!

Be aware of collateral.  If your friend lives alone and it's expressly a rarely-used guest bedroom, that's one thing.  If they co-live with family, friends, whatever, you might be using somebody else's room while they're out.  Even if I'd do the deed on my FRIEND's bed, I wouldn't do it on their roommate's bed without explicit consent with significant trust behind it.

Locked bedroom is probably fine, but if you're staying on a pull out couch in the living room, not so much. Third factor is how long you're staying. If you're only staying one night, it's probably better to just hold off. If you're staying for a week or more, it's more expected that you might have sex at some point. In between in a gray area.

My wife, myself and 15 month old son were traveling through Tennessee we were in the state maybe 25 mins.\n\nThere are mainly just long single roads that have no where to pull over in an emergency, well traveling down one we heard a large metal noise and our SUV kinda popped up like we hit something pretty bad.  We went to pull off into a private entrance that had a gate and realized our brakes were not working.\n\nSo we made a quick decision not to destroy the gate (cause gates cost shit tons of money) and went into a ditch. I went to get out the back seat to check everyone and hear screaming \"get the fuck back in the car\" confused try again to get out hear same thing look over and see a cop with a gun pointed at me. \n\nTry to yell out brakes failed and dude just aims higher at my face so I get back in the car. Cop walks around car pointing gun at my wife and child. Then starts telling us to get out one by one. Doesn't allow me or wife to grab child or even make sure any of us are okay. \n\nStarts searching us while I'm telling him my kids in the damn car, he walks over and opens the door like he's about to be ambushed pointing gun at a 1 year old kid. Can finally get him and try to see if he's okay.\n\nCop starts saying he was behind us and saw something fall off our car and we ran it over causing it to pop up and hit his cruiser (so lets get this straight you actually witnessed some sort of mechanical failure and that's how you react)\n\nStarts going off about he believes we have drugs in the car, that we were trying to run away from him and we cannot leave cause he's called a drug dog(no ambulance mind you).\n\nYes we're trying to run with a beater car on a single road with my wife, myself, child and cat in the car okay.\n\nStory gets long but my point is if you have out of state plates, stay away from small towns as well as hick towns for your own safety. \n\nCould of easily been murdered.\n\nIf I was injured or incorherent, if my wife got out before I did. If we had phones in our hands to call for help. If I ignored commands to check my family's safety. If my cat decided to jump out the open door.\n\nIf we took other actions that day we could of been hurt or worse, why would we expect a police officer with a drawn weapon as a family who just had a car accident. \n\nIf I decided to browse Reddit before the crash and had the phone in my hand when I stepped out the car. If we destroyed the gate instead. Who knows?\n\nNotice I am saying if a lot this is because your actions matter, no matter how insignificant they seem. You make hundreds if not thousands of actions/thoughts/choices a day that lead you to a certain moment in time. \n\nAnyways my rambling point is while traveling the only person watching out for you is inside your vehicle."

For instance, it has been experimentally shown that people who lose a movie ticket after purchasing the ticket won't in most cases buy it again. But, having lost the same amount of money as the ticket value just before buying it doesn't make a different and people will still buy the ticket. This is because in the first case, the person depleted the mental account for movie when they spent it on that ticket and were unwilling to spend any more cash on the ticket. In the second case, the mental account for \"movie\" had still not been depleted, the money lost came from a general spending mental account. \n\nThe mental account you've set for 'time out with friends' is more than $30 and you're comfortable spending it. While the mental account you've set for games, clothes etc might not be so. Also, purchasing games or clothes is not a regular activity while hanging out with friends is. Therefore, you're more cognitively involved while doing those things and less cognitively involved while spending money with friends. More cognition implies more rational behaviour and hence you're thinking about the value you'll be getting for that $30. \n\nThis isn't unique to you, most people are like this in these scenarios...",

            "I bet there's a few things working together here.\n\nFirst, if you just constantly paid 30 for a game, you could end up spending literally thousands on games. Hanging out, however, can't really happen more than once simultaneously. It literally forces you to spread out your expenditure due to time and such. You're not likely to spend more than $30 every week or every other week. You *could* do the same with games, but that requires spreading out by choice than by force.\n\nAnd, sort of tying into the first one, there's something about getting value from your purchase. If you already have like 6 games that are kinda similar to the one you're about to buy, it becomes more difficult to justify paying another $30 for something you \"already have\". But, going out and eating/drinking with friends? You don't just \"already have\" it. You need to spend the money to enjoy it again. Sort of like buying new pants when yours are fine vs. buying new pants when you just tore a huge hole in your last pair.\n\nLastly, it probably helps a bit that food and drink are necessary for survival, so doing that in a fun environment is probably valued a little higher.\n\nAll speculations.",

But before all of that, I have to deal with the need vs want struggle as well; I have to ask myself if I need the thing that I want to get and if I don\u2019t need it, is it still worth getting?\n\nIf you carry around a water bottle regularly, the same thing tends to come up with bottled water, I\u2019ve found.

(I also buy store brand.)  \n\nI am not some frugal nut. I just also prefer the other savings and lack of hassle vs going out. I actually enjoy crowds and meetin new people, thus why I go to conventions like a mad man. PAX !!!!!    \n\nBut I despise the hassle of waiting in lines, waiting to be seated, waiting for my waiter, etc....  \n\nBut I LOVE paying for a great dining experience. So I tend to go to MUCH more expensive Restaurants. And only if everything is perfect.  \n\nSo it is not just the price, but the experience. I also have no issue spending on games more often than not. But almost never buy movies. I just watch them when they are free or rent (I usually only watch a movie once ever. I have maybe 10 movies I own and even they only get watched once a year.. well Once a month for Interstellar)  \n\nI GREATLY value vs price when it comes to certain experiences as well.  \n\nI adore a cheap burger that tastes pretty good for $1 vs a great burger that cost me $10.  \n\nI dunno. Overall I have been made fun of for my frugal ways. But they are not really frugal.. I just find certain spending a waste of money vs the cheaper and better method. (My $6 Ribeye is WAY fcuking better than any $20-$40 Ribeye I have ever had.  However the $120 filet minion that I could slowly cut with a fork was astonishing as was the service. Worth every penny. as was the Truffle potatoes.. And my wife had Truffel Risoto. Only once in our lives ever, but HOLY SHIT! worht every penny and we are planning when to go again.)  \n\nAnd part of why we can afford those things once or twice a year is by only spending $3 a night on some drinks and $8 on a home made dinner. Vs $30-$60 3+ nights a week going out.  \n\nIt also helps that we like hosting and enjoy being with our family at home. So i am sure there are other caveats with home life, family, friends, and such.    \n\nTL;DR I think exactly the opposite.  ",

            "I think an economist would say that the marginal benefit out weighs the cost to you. Eating and drinking with friends is worth more to you than $30. There is the value of the food and drink, the psychological benefit of the social interaction and the perceived future benefits of maintaining the social connections, which your brain combines and values at more than $30. Other purchases might be more uncertain. Ask yourself what price the game and clothes would need to be for you would buy it with the same enthusiasm that you buy food and drink with friends and then you can kinda quantify the difference in value. ",
            "It's a concept of the emotional value you put on an item. Think of the last item you bought What was it for? What would that task accomplish? And how much happiness does that task provide you with? \n\nFor nominal items that value is typically three things. You need it to live, you want it to make yourself happy, or you want it to make other people happy (in term making you happy)\n\nIn all of those situations after a while you realise the ability a certain item has in acomplishing those tasks. Which obviously isn't much. Sure there's a high but it's not sustainable.\n\nOn the other hand you have time out with people. You are with other people making them happy and you yourself are having fun so you are happy. The problem isn't that you just blow your money away and you're dumb. You don't go to the highest class club you can find or buy the most expensive items on the menu. You have a value associated with being with people and are willing to pay it. So for you that's 30 dollars. For someone it might be 15, some one else 300. It all depends on relative income of you, your friends and your interests. ",
            "Yep, a couple drinks and some fries and that\u2019s 30 right there. A real meal? Looking at 50+. Just for one meal that\u2019s prob not even as good as just getting an in n out burger and coke, buying a bottle of liquor and making drinks at home.\n\nYet I\u2019ll pause when considering a 20$ T shirt or video game I\u2019ll play for dozens of hours.

            "funny, I have the opposite problem.  I can justify $30 on clothes or games because I'll use them over and over again, but $30 for one meal or outing with friends?  I can feed everyone at my house for that much money!",
            "For me it's because you have plenty of clothes, you don't need to buy a new one because that fav shirt of yours is still good enough even for a date.\n\nBut food is, well, food. If you don't have it now, you might as well starve to death. \n\nPlus, it's more like essential and needs. Food is essential, clothes is need. What is more important here?\n\n30$ of food, maybe idk, a lobster? You don't get to eat that much often. \n\n30$ for a clothes? Do you really need it? Do you have to buy it because all of your clothes is not good enough for an interview? You don't have a suit? Sure go buy one. Otherwise, you don't really need to buy it at all.\n\nUnless you have that extra money though, imo, just go for it. What else can you lose except for the 30$?",

            "Because your priorities are a bit messed up. Or they're just right -  it depends what you want!  But priorities can get messed up with this stuff. Everyone's got their thing where they default to thrifty or default to spending and they're not not necessarily in line with your values or desires. I think a lot of it is socialisation, how you were raised and what your friends do. Eg if your family growing up always ate out, or your social group now does, well it'd be kind of weird if you didn't, right? Especially because that $20 burger place is just around the corner and it looks so good, and everyone does it anyway... vs if your family was thrifty with food and your friends are too you'd look at people going to the burger place like they're crazy. \n\nOr you might always buy a video game new vs waiting a year for the price to drop. To some people the first is the sensible way to do it and to others the first is insane. \n\nSo yeah it's a combination of what you're used to doing -what you see as \"normal\" - and your actual values, if the two are lined up you'll have a good time, if without quite realising it your normal and your values aren't lined up then it can get a bit weird \n\n",

            "No matter how many times my wife and I have re-done our household budget, we never, ever lower the food budget. Food is important. Food is social interactions. Food is date night. Even when eating at home, food is each of us helping the other out with household chores. Food is love. Shopping together and cooking together and eating together and cleaning up together.

The \"proof\" element mainly stars that if other people around us are behaving in a certain way then they must be right or else they wouldn't have portray those behaviors in the first place. In this case if your friends are all spending $30 on drinks then unconsciously you will be more willing to pay. ",
            "I have this same double standard, but only when I'm traveling. I see the prices differently. But still, material things don't value much to me at home or aboard, only food has that effect. ",

            "For me, it's kinda the opposite. I'm thinking of how I can probably get more food for less at a fast food place, but won't think twice about dropping $60 on a video game cuz it's worth more than a days worth of work, and will give back several days worth of entertainment ",

He was probably so scared and confused at the time and im glad he chose me to pick on because i really didnt care at all as opposed to someone where it wouldve ruined their whole high school experience. I dont think he meant to hurt me back then, but was just trying to protect himself. I really do believe people can change, judging someone to who they were when they were 16 would be unfair. But my experience was pretty minor imo, if someone was beating my ass daily in HS i dont know if i could get over that.",

            "Met two of my bullies later on, one of them was working as a cook in a shitty restaurant, the other seemed to have some health issues (saw him in a medical clinic). But what stuck to me is that they both immediately recognized me and went to talk to me, and my genuine reaction was : \"Who are you ?\". I genuinely didn't remember their name or face, it took me a while to associate them with the vague image of the older boys who bullied me in middle school.  \n\n\nTo them, middle school was the best part of their life.

I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call them bullies, but I always felt very uncomfortable and out of place. Their friends that they had over were more rude towards me than they were. \n\nAnyways, out of the blue a couple of years later, one of the roommates messages me on Facebook and apologizes (the nicest of the three, of course). She noted that she felt awful about the situation and didn\u2019t realize at the time how bad I must\u2019ve felt. It was a genuine apology as she reached out to me directly and didn\u2019t ask for anything, including forgiveness. She just wanted to apologize. I accepted, and then we wished each other well and that was that.",

            "My bully from age 5-12 posed as my best friend for years. Consistently made fun of me etc. I would go no contact, he\u2019d apologize, repeat the cycle. I joined a hockey team and was pretty good. He kept wanting to join and I kept making vague excuses about roster spots. One day he just joined\u2026. He was bad. And he also was intruding on my friendships with people who were actually nice to me (the captain of my team would make fun of me for hitting the post on an empty net, and he\u2019d make fun of me for having buck teeth. Quite different.. the former was to make sure I knew I was one of the guys, the latter to be made to feel less than). First day of high school, with coaches permission, I kicked him off the team. He apparently had a nervous breakdown and had to be homeschooled. I never felt bad about it.  I did try to bang his sister out of spite but the one time the chance was there I just made it official with a different girl and I don\u2019t cheat. In hindsight, I\u2019m glad about that. \n\nA few years go by and he messages me on aim and says \u201cwant to break bread\u201d I say no. You were never nice to me.  Saw him randomly at Home Depot a few years later and didn\u2019t recognize him till much later. \n\n2nd bully was an older boy who lived down the street. He made 7 year old me miserable. Fast forward 25 years to adulthood and he is taking care of his sick grandfather and father (who also were standoffish with me but they gave good halloween candy so whatever). I had to take care of my ailing mother, and I when I was at the parents house indefinitely, I bumped into him while walking my dog. Maybe the 2nd or third time we chatted he said something like \u201clisten man, I wasn\u2019t really nice when I was younger and I\u2019m sorry if I was a dick to you, but it wasn\u2019t just you\u201d\u2026. All at once every shitty thing he did to me flashed through my mind and exited my brain\u2026 I gave him a fist bump, said we\u2019re cool, and I meant it. Taking responsibility is hard enough and the only valid apology is changed behavior, he committed to the first and I would see about the second. We\u2019re friends now (shoot the shit, chat, occasionally smoke a J together\u2026 people can change if they want to) and I genuinely believe he changed the trajectory of his life when he developed self awareness.",

            "They\u2019ve never apologised to me and probably never will, so no. I would also find it very difficult to forgive a group of boys who singled me out and sexually harassed me until I had to leave the school. It disrupted my education, gave me social anxiety and contributed (but was far from being the only reason) to me ultimately being diagnosed with complex PTSD as an adult. \n\nI can forgive the chick who called me ugly and the guy who bullied me for coming from a poor family (already forgiven them); that\u2019s one thing, but constant and persistent sexual harassment is on another level. I don\u2019t think I could ever forgive that. They were never punished despite me reporting it multiple times, so I highly doubt they ever learned their lesson. That kind of behaviour only tends to get worse as people get older and I don\u2019t doubt that at least one of them went on to sexually assault somebody. Simply knowing that it\u2019s possible that I actually got off easy and somebody else got hurt even worse means that I can\u2019t forgive them.\n\nYour story of forgiveness is lovely though. I\u2019m glad you were able to get that closure, sincerely.",

He told me a friend of his had been going through a hard time and he realized that he did the same thing to me that his friend was going through. Said he didn't want anyone else to feel like his friend and wanted to make amends. I forgave him because he offered to be someone I can talk to when I'm going through a hard time. Even though I haven't taken up the offer, he still reaches out every now and then to check up on me.\n\nAnother bully, ironically a really small guy. Ego too big to realize everyone hated him and thought he was a dick. Went through 3 different relationships before turning 18, now in a fourth one.

Not even an apology).i had 1 friend who refused to leave me like that and helped me get back.I had to have surgery to get it set right. I was off of school for 3 weeks. I remember the night before i had to go back like it was right now. I was so scared. I felt vulnerable, and i begged my mom not to make me go back. I knew I couldn't rely on the teachers to help me, and i knew I wouldn't be safe.   My mom told me i was overreacting, and i was going back. The very next day, i was crutching to class and Robert came from behind and kicked my crutch out from underneath me and i fell and landed right on my ankle and un did everything the surgeon had done and more. In a fit of rage, i took a swing at him with my orher crutch. I was suspended for 3 days and needed to see the couniler at school once a week once i got back because i tried to attack a student with a weapon. I had to do a 3 day inschool suspension when i got back because i missed so much school. They didn't do anything to him because no one saw him do it.... except half of our class. I had to have surgery again, and this time, they put pins and rods in. i have had more than one surgery since then as an adult. All because he wanted to look cool to his friends.  I am 47 now, and every morning when i wake up, when i put weight on that ankle. Its painful.

His Dad was some sort of big shot where he worked. This kid always talked down to me. Then the insults started.y clothes, hair, the usual. Then the physical abuse started. He punched me in the side of my head pretty much every day. Nothing hard, just enough to hurt. I would move seats, but he would ways find me. The teacher there was useless. This went on all semester. After Christmas break was over, his dad got transferred to another state, so he had to move. I was very embarrassed this happened. My parents never knew about this. I have been out of high school since 1987. I just recently told my wife about this. She understood because she was bullied for being a teacher's kid.

My dad went straight to the Principal's office and surprisingly, the bully left me alone after that. Then suddenly about a few weeks later, he moved away.\n\nIn 5th grade, there was another new kid.. he was twice my size. Kept bumping into me on purpose, as his goal was to get me to fall down or whatever which would dirty my clothes. This too went on for a few weeks. I told on him to the teachers but it made it worse when he found out. Then one day I snapped. I just decided to \"throw down\" during recess. I shoved him back. He shoved me harder and I fell. I got up and just gave him a good punch to his gut and he threw a pencil at me. It almost hit my eye but I remember selling it like I got shot.\n\nHe immediately apologized when the teachers saw what happened. All I remember were some classmates giving me props while I was in tears. Then the next day that bully stopped bumping into me and just left me alone. As far as I could tell, he didn't bully anyone else either for the rest of the year. The following year, he moved away also.\n\nSo to answer your question.. did I ever forgive them? Probably not.

Anyway, fast forward ten years we were at a party, my wife and her friends are quite middle class whereas I am firmly working class and these two clowns thought it would be a good idea to look down their metaphorical noses at me. Mistake. They proceeded to slip back into early 2000's mode and come back with a bottle of water, laughingly talking about what they used to do with water and threatening my then girlfriend (now wife) to do it again. I gave the obvious leader one friendly verbal warning that it wouldn't be a good idea and that the would be immediate consequences should he not take himself and the water bottle away from me and my girlfriend, but it was too late he'd already slipped into bully mode, he pointed the bottled water at her chest...\n\nMy wife absolutely deplores violence, she even gives me a row for getting into ruckus's on the rugby field where sometimes it's inevitable, but she proudly tells the story that I quite willingly gave the person who made her schooldays hell an absolute hiding in front of some of the other people who made it hell. Let's just say it sent a bit of a message.\n\nIronically my son is in class with his son these days and he's going the same way as his father, my boy who is more like his mother than me is going to Tai Kwon Do lessons because I know he isn't going to be the type to fight back, I'd rather other kids know that if they try it on he is trained and able to hurt them swiftly even though he won't want to.",

            "I (46m) was bullied hardcore in middle school by a female high schooler. \"Jennifer\" was a cheerleader who was clearly insecure despite being smart and attractive. Years ago I encountered her at a party thrown by my oldest cousin and at first I just kind of ignored her but as the drinks started to flow we started talking. \n\nI had a knack for connecting with women on a sexual and emotional level back then and soon had her laughing and fully focused on me. She was touching my arm every chance she got and making obvious sexual innuendos. \n\nI had sex with Jennifer in my cousin's spare room that night. It was wild and animalistic. When I woke up the next morning she was still naked on top of the blankets stroking my chest and smiling at me, but I no longer felt the way that I did the night before. \n\nWith her makeup wore off in the daylight, her face looked more similar to how it did on the school bus and it completely took me back to how horrible she was to me. Even though now she was completely naked and vulnerable. \n\nI was as polite as I could possibly be but I got dressed and told her I had to leave. I could tell that she was disappointed and a little bit hurt but there was no part of me that could sympathize with her even though it was 15 years later.\n\nMy cousin had gone to bed much earlier and didn't see the impending hookup happening the night before. It was then that she informed me that Jennifer was actually married to a guy who had bullied me a couple years after Jennifer when I was a freshman. Jesus Christ.",
            "Grew up before social media so no idea. I hope they figured out whatever what was going on in their lives that caused them to behave that way and are now doing well. I don't know if that means I forgave them or not but I don't wish ill on them.",

Then, left the country a few years later. I haven't seen anyone who I had bullied since. However if I ever do come across them, I will hope that a sincere apology at least goes a tiny bit of the way to show them what a dickhead I think I was.\n\nBullying takes years of self-reflection to rid yourself of, and it never really goes away. Decades later, I am still working on it every day.",
            "My bully went to an expensive college, bought an expensive house and car, and then her child was born with severe disabilities. Her and her spouse are now regularly asking for donations and financial assistance. She has to work around the clock taking care of her disabled child. But from what I've seen, it seems like she has really grown into a more beautiful  person in taking care of her special needs child. I love seeing her videos and pictures of the two of them playing and dressing up. Life comes at you fast.  \n  \nAt the end of the day I wish her nothing but the best. Growing up, she made my life absolute hell, and constantly made fun of my parents for working 10-12+ hour days and never being able to be there for me (school functions, after school activities...they just had to work ALL of the time). She was also the one who pointed out on my birth certificate that my dad \"adopted\" me and wasn't my biological dad (I didn't know). She made fun of me relentlessly for that. My parents couldn't afford much, and she made fun of me every day for my clothes, Walmart and Dollar general versions of everything I needed, etc.. I didn't mind that my parents worked HARD for everything they had, it's made me a hard worker. It just really hurt as a kid growing up, having someone constantly belittle you and remind you that no one's there. It made me feel so small.",

I definitely recognise him, you can't forget face who bullied you. \n\nI help him as much as i could, at the end of the appointment, he just thanks me and told me \" If i knew you would help me later, i never acted like that when we were 13\", i just answer that \"I forgive but not forget\". \n\nI was definitely proud of myself to overcome my old anger. He still pass at my work say hello sometimes. Little kid inside me still a bit angry, but im proud of myself.",
            "Not the only bully from my high school but here we go\u2026\n\nStarted in senior year, I took was a scrawny little twig for my entire high school career and got called \u201cgay\u201d a lot. Didn\u2019t really bother me, what bothered me more was that it was constant. Like I can\u2019t really remember many days where that wasn\u2019t something that happened. I had signed up for Choir because my best friend was in it and said I should join. \n\nThis dude, let\u2019s call him Terry, was a Tenor like me. He sat near me and was the typical redneck idiot. Practically every time we would be in the choir room practicing he\u2019d say something to the effect of \u201cyou\u2019re gay lol\u201d. His favorite was \u201cyou look like you got some sugar in your tank\u201d. I deal with it and ignore him because, honestly who gives a shit, if this is the best everyone can do on insults it\u2019s pretty pathetic. \n\nFast forward to about 3/4 of the school year, Terry isn\u2019t in choir anymore. A week goes by and one of his friends (a jock who wasn\u2019t really a dick, just a bit\u2026 jocky) asks \u201cHey, where\u2019s Terry?\u201d One of the girls in class immediately responds \u201cWait, you haven\u2019t heard?! He got arrested!\u201d She quickly got out her phone and pulled up an article from a local news network and began reading it. \n\nTurns out that there had been a party that Terry went to. There was a young girl that also went to this party, and by young I mean I think 14, maybe younger. She had snuck in and was telling everyone that she was 17 or something. Well, Terry really thought she was hot and started giving her drinks (booze, not Kool-Ade). After a while he tried having sex with her, the girl refused, so Terry threatened to kill her family if she didn\u2019t have sex with him. I can\u2019t remember specifics, but I\u2019m pretty sure the girl ran away and contacted police. Terry was arrested for Sexual Battery and got a court date. Now, I don\u2019t know how\u2026 I truly don\u2019t\u2026 but somehow Terry got off with basically a slap on the wrist and a mild sentence of like, a couple months and no sexual predator stuff on his record. Didn\u2019t hear much about him after that, went on, graduated and started living my life. \n\nSeveral years later a friend from high school messaged me on FaceBook. \u201cHey, remember Terry?\u201d \u201cThe guy who somehow isn\u2019t in prison right now, yeah, I remember him. Why?\u201d \u201cHe just got arrested by InterPol.\u201d\n\nTurns out that Terry went on a cruise. He got a woman drunk and raped her in his cabin. She contacted the staff of the cruise and they began to handle things. Now, the interesting part is that the ship was in international waters, which means it\u2019s no specific country\u2019s jurisdiction, which means InterPol got involved. Meaning he can\u2019t use (what everyone in high school assumed but never got clarification on) daddy\u2019s money to get out of this one. \n\nLast I heard he was rotting in a prison cell. \n\nGood. Now who\u2019s got sugar in their tank, Terry?",

Turns out he went drunk Joy riding and crashes and died. \nHughschool: guy was picking moreso on my handicapped friend than me, and now being older and wiser (As well as more built and trained) I tried to get them to stop by talking to them,  even went to the principal. Nothing was done so I ended up getting in a fight at lunch with the guy. Beat the shit outta him. He got sent off to some behavioral camp. I had suspension and fines. Fast forward a year or so and he shows up unexpectedly at a mutual friends house. I was ready for round 2, but he approached me and actually apologized. Said he had a lot of anger and shit going on in his life and took it out on me and my friends and that I was a wake up call he needed. To this day were good friends.",

            "2 comments here. 1 is a was hand story i just heard from someone. I saw a someone at a HS reunion recently (over 30 yr reunion) who said that someone else qt the reunion came up to him and apologized for being nasty to him in HS. said it was bc they had it tough at home and took it out on him. my friend said he didn't even remember it until they apologized but it brought it all back and then he got a little internally upset bc it brought back those feelings. he said he appreciated the apology but it just made him relive it. 2nd comment: my son was bullied a lot in the neighborhood, on the bus and at school bc he was on the spectrum. he was small and didn't know what to do.  we did enroll him in karate (not bc of that just bc he was hyperactive and wanted to give him something constructive to do). and several yrs later, after parents and schools doing nothing at all, he got bullied in 7th and 8th grade and finally fought back in the moment in school. he got a lot bigger and defended himself.  a kid  was kicking his heels all the way out of the lunchroom. which the lunchroom monitors didn't notice bc they were gabbing. he told the kid to stop many times and finally turned around and kicked and pushed the kid. then walked to the deans office and reported himself. they got suspended, but the kid didn't bug him again. then another kid did it to him at a party our families were at together.  wouldn't stop making fun of him or calling him names. my kid punched him and then went and told on himself to the kids' dad. sorry, I punched your kid, but he just wouldn't stop. the parents got furious and made a huge scene and left. our friends were kind of mad at us, but this is one time where we didn't reprimand him too hard. once word started to get around that he wasn't an easy target, kids started leaving him alone. I hate to encourage violence in any form but it is really the only answer. I feel badly for the kids that can't defend themselves like that. they're too nice or small and afraid. where are all the adults and what's with the lack of parenting?",

I would turn our friend group against him and we would just tease him and talk crap about him behind his back. We tried our hand at cyber bullying before it was a thing.

My terrible home life made me sad and vulnerable which drew bullies to me like a magnet. \n\nThis one kid started picking on me in my physics class. His name was Eric. He sat behind me. Came from a different grade/middle school. I didn\u2019t know him at all,and practically from the first day of class he started poking me from behind, said snotty remarks about to make the other kids laugh at me, ect. \n\nHe made my school life hell. One day I saw him in the hallway at his locker, with his back to me, and I just snapped. \n\nI don\u2019t even remember my thought processes, just suddenly I was punching him in his back. He turned around and swung back at me. I ducked and popped him one right in the eye. I was wearing my big class ring when I hit him. \n\nThen a teacher broke it up. Normally kids fighting were sent to the principal\u2019s office, but me being a girl fighting a boy the teacher didn\u2019t know what to do, so I didn\u2019t have any punishment. \n\nThe kid developed a big shiner, classic looking black and blue with an almost shut eye by the next day. \n\nHe pretended that he had been hit in the face by a basketball. No one believed that for a minute. The fight happened in front of a dozen kids, in the crowded hallway between classes. \n\nI remember a few weeks later he started trying to be a bully to me again.

People have learned not to fuck with me.  No I don\u2019t forgive them because they knew exactly what they were doing, and had the chance to apologize. You\u2019ve got to put people in their place sometimes.\n\nTwo bullies from childhood are in dead end  jobs and overweight. Living in the poor part of town. One in a small, shitty house and the other one in an apartment with two kids and is divorced.  The girl who bullied me is with one loser guy after another and comes off like such trash on the Internet. Lewd and opinionated and embarrassing.  Both are hillbillies.\n\nI have learned karma is real with these people after I have really analyzed their lives. You get what you give in this world in terms of energy. It may not be immediately apparent, but what goes around really does come around.  By how these people ended up, they clearly treat people poorly and had losers in their circles and they became losers themselves. Self-fulfilling prophecy. Watch who you hang around with."
