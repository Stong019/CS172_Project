            "So there are three issues here:\n\n1.\t**Knowledge**: if it was only a question of \u2018do you know the material or not\u2019 the answer would probably be, no, they wouldn\u2019t revoke most general bachelor\u2019s degrees. While degrees are topical, by and large they\u2019re really just training in how to think. That is, many people with English or math degrees don\u2019t know shit about their fields, and just got a piece of paper in whatever was easiest for them so they could qualify for a job in middle management at a company that sells paper. However, in some fields like engineering, it would be an immediate disqualifier on this basis alone, because lives depend on your certified knowledge, and you just put that certification into question. Also note, this one would be self-policing to some extent: if you cheat through your bio degree, you\u2019re probably not getting into med school, which makes it YOUR problem, not the school\u2019s. \n2.\t**Integrity**: yes, you\u2019re now a liar, but people lie; it takes a lot to admit that, and to come clean. If you were to do that on your own, without being caught, it\u2019s possible you could redeem yourself with time and effort. So while this would certainly put you in the hot seat, it wouldn\u2019t be a deal breaker. \n3.\t**Trust**: at its root, all a degree is is a trusted organization vouching that you know what you say you do. You have now called your knowledge into question. But more importantly, *you have also called the school\u2019s credibility into question*. You\u2019re all but forcing them to revoke your degree - not because they give a shit about you one way or the other, but because they have to protect their own bottom line. \n\nTL;DR: for most degree fields, the knowledge issue wouldn\u2019t be a deal-breaker, nor would the lying. But the threat to the school\u2019s credibility would be a hard line. As a practical matter, they\u2019d probably try to ignore you if they could, but if you went out of your way to make it an issue they couldn\u2019t ignore...yes; they\u2019d revoke. They would also instantly revoke anytime that issues of liability came up. ",

            "Not an answer to your question but a relevant story:\n\nIn high school I gained notoriety for doing peoples papers and guarantee an A for $20 bucks. By junior year I had business cards and a five dollar discount for a student who reffered me to another. If I didn't get them an A, they'd get their money back, though this only happened under ten times. By senior year, I was doing English finals for $50 bucks a pop. I never had a summer job, I just did peoples homework. Towards the end of my senior year I was getting in trouble for all sorts of stupid stuff (ditching classes, protesting school rules, and general disruption) which escalated to me facing an expulsion trial. Instead of going to the trial I just dropped out.\n\nI moved from the suburbs to Chicago and still helped a few friends finish some projects and finals for rent money. That summer I compiled a word document consisting of 96 papers I had done for other students (8 of those were English finals) with the intention to notify the dean and principal of my misgivings, if only to spite them.\n\nUltimately I did not turn the document in, as some of those papers were done for students who were sophomores or juniors and I did not want to jeopardize them.\n\nFlash forward ten years later, I wrote a book (Self-published through CreateSpace, nothing special) when my old Creative Writing teacher invited me to do a presentation about self publishing in the auditorium of my old high school for an event called Writer's Week. I did that. It was neat coming back to the school I dropped out of / was almost expelled from. In the main office was a series of pictures of 'Notable Alumni' including a friend of mine who went on to become a director for a Chicago based 'Today! Show'... Which made me smile because I had helped him get all of his English credits. I confessed this to my Creative Writing Teacher who simply laughed, and said \"Well, that explains why you were always getting C's on your written assignments but acing all of tests.\"\n\nTL;DR\nI did alot of homework for pay, dropped out, almost turned in all of the students, came back 10 years later and saw a friend on a wall of notable alumni who only graduated because of me.",

The person who brought the counterfeit bills into the city was getting his grandma to run everyday errands for him.

They show a badge, maybe a business card, I\u2019m sure you could ask to see state ID as well. You can also call the local office and explain that an agent is at your door and you just want to confirm they are an employee, which is common. Same if you are called by FBI, you can look up the main office number and verify they are who they are. Local PD would not be able to verify identity of federal agency employees, and vice versa.

I was unaware of the fraud but since I profited off of it I was technically a target of investigation.  I had a bit of a heads up since the fraud was uncovered a few months before so I had found a lawyer.\n\nFirst and foremost DO NOT TALK TO THE FBI WITHOUT A LAWYER!! \n\nIf they knock on your door, be polite and let them introduce themselves and show their badges.  They may ask to come in, but without a warrant cannot legally enter your house.  Do not show them ID even if asked.  They may ask to talk about the incident in question and that you aren't in trouble, etc. \n\nThis is where people trip themselves up.  They think they can talk their way out of it or explain it away.  I don't care how innocent you are, or even if you were just a witness to the crime.  LAWYER UP! This will protect you from accidentally implicating yourself.  \n\nSimply say this, \"I am interested in answering you questions, but I will not do so without a lawyer present.\" Take their business card and find a lawyer who practices in this area.  Your lawyer will contact the FBI.  This will also prevent a faker from gaining any info as well.\n\nThe agent assigned to my case was a very decent, very friendly guy and I honestly wanted to tell him what I knew.  I could even see myself having a beer and being friends with the guy.  But until my case was resolved, I said absolutely nothing to him without my lawyer present.\n\nThese are highly trained agents that are very good at questioning witnesses.  Chances are you have no training in being on the other side.  Even if you do, still say nothing.\n\nLuckily for me as the investigation continued I was determined that I had no role in the fraud and technically a victim, despite making money (which all went to my attorney).",

            "All you really have to do is put in the work nobody else wants to do with a little bit of right place at the right time. I\u2019m a biologist working as an independent contractor that graduated from school working in an algae lab for $12.50/hr. Lab got defunded, lost my job, found a job 300 miles away doing basic grunt work digging and looking for endangered animals to relocate for an upcoming solar project (California) and after find older more established biologist, decided to offer my help on a lot of the stuff they were doing, whether it be trapping, tagging, surveys, and a lot of different things and slowly but surely I got A LOT of valuable experience. Keep in mind that all this volunteering was done at night or late evening AFTER having already worked a full 10 hour physically intense day. A lot of sacrifices were made along with many many sleepless nights away from home and in cold/hot brutal weather. But when people see that they notice it, and someone convinced me to try doing independent work as there\u2019s a strong demand for biologist for a lot of short term and mid term projects, that don\u2019t want to hire consulting firms or firms that don\u2019t want to hire employees for certain projects. Soon enough you start making 2-4x the amount of your coworkers and as long as you\u2019re good with your money, that starts adding up after the first year or two. Then like that, if you invested and saved and didn\u2019t live too much above the means of you peers, you can find yourself a millionaire by the time you\u2019re 30, and a multi millionaire by the time you\u2019re 40 and so on. I do want to say that a lot of it is luck in the sense you kinda gotta be where the focus is, but also it\u2019s very possible with a lot of hard work and determination. I hate hearing people say it\u2019s not possible, and that working hard isn\u2019t always gonna give it, but also in my experience the people that say that think they work hard, and don\u2019t actually compare at all to those who are constantly grinding. I\u2019m talking about giving up Tv, games, hanging out with your friends a lot, and even maintaining a relationship in the beginning. You gotta work, read, take courses online, go into a bit of credit card debt, and really struggle for 6 months to a year before you really start to see fruits of labor. That\u2019s my experience and opinion, but yes. Definitely possible if you\u2019re willing to work for it and seek those to learn from and use that to your advantage.",

Some people are born with horseshoes up their ass, some people have so much ambition it\u2019s almost impossible to stop them, some are just so talented there\u2019s no way they won\u2019t succeed, some people are so genius it\u2019s almost impossible to stop them , some people just won\u2019t settle for less than their dreams. But, most of us aren\u2019t these people. Most of us are average, maybe a bit above or below that. Most of us won\u2019t get that kind of break. Most won\u2019t be born with some insane innate talent. Many people have too much else going against them to have the energy even to try. Just remembered, though yes, even most celebrities have some kind of advantage like family in the biz or family money, a few genuinely worked their asses off or happened to get lucky. Apply the same to most wealth creating situations: some will succeed. Odds aren\u2019t great if you start at the bottom, but it\u2019s not impossible.",
            "With the performance of the equity markets and amount of investable dollars waiting to fund the next big idea out of there, I\u2019d argue it\u2019s possibly easier now than ever before to build wealth. Even for the every day middle class person, index funds have made earning stellar returns extremely cheap and easy without a money manager taking an arm and a leg. Will there continue to be a larger disparity between the haves and the have nots? Probably. Will cost of living continue to outpace inflation as it has in the past? Almost definitely. But a college graduate with a decent starting job and discipline can most certainly become \u201cwealthy\u201d or \u201cextremely financially secure\u201d over a period of time.",

            "The answer is certainly that it's possible. You could bet all of your money on ridiculously leveraged stock and stock options or cryptocurrency and get lucky enough times in a row to become wealthy. That's not to say it would be likely for any particular compulsive gambler, but certainly it's possible. The same goes for the lottery in terms of possible lucky outcomes. Otherwise, you could become wealthy from buying and renting out properties, although it takes time the build the capital to get started with that, and there are some inherent risks. You could also get rich if you create some sort of art that people want to pay for. \n\nIf you're asking if you can get rich from working a standard job and investing conservatively. I think you're be able to retire with a more than a million dollars no problem if you earn 40k a year on average for your career and live modestly, but I don't think having a million dollars will mean you are rich by the time you retire if you were born in the last 20 years.\n\nSo the way I see it, if you want to get wealth to the point of comfort from scratch in a practical way(avoiding gambling with negative expected value or extreme risk investing), you either need to work for a long time and save aggressively, or you need to have a unique idea that earns you money. Moderately high risk investing is not necessarily a bad idea either, but make sure you know what you're doing.",

Either way it can multiply insanely quick.\n\nBy climbing the work ladder or starting their own business? No, absolutely not. The system has become way too rigged in favor of the current players who indulge in nepotism to fill high vacancies.

            "Starting from absolutely nothing like born in the gutter and raised on the streets?\n\nNo",
            "Definitely depends on your definition of \"wealthy\" and \"on their own\".\n\nIf you're talking millionaires, any American with enough income from their job (and/or discipline in saving) that consistently contributes to their 401k can become a millionaire by retirement.  That doesn't mean everyone can, unfortunately: but it does mean that there's a lot of people who are becoming self made millionaires unless you consider the 401k to disqualify you as having been \"self made\".\n\nIf you're talking billionaires... that's a tougher question.  I wouldn't consider getting free money from your parents, or the luxury of not having to have a day job, to be \"self made.\"  I also would say that self made also means that they needed to have not exploited others in order to make their money (circumventing labor laws, finding ways to pay people less than a living wage/depending on their employees receiving welfare in order to subsidize them, etc...) and with that definition I am not entirely sure if any billionaire that exists today qualifies.  But that's just my definition.  Self made is a pretty hazy term, and I'd consider it to be more of a spectrum.  For instance, some schmuck that gets 500 million dollars and turns it into a billion... yeah great but that's not self made.  Someone getting a $25k loan from their family to start a business?  Maybe technically not self made, but would still be impressive.\n\nThere's also no shame in not being self made necessarily.  They just shouldn't pretend like they are, or like \"anyone\" can replicate what they did.  My problem's more with the people who build up a false narrative about their background than about whether or not they got help on the way up.",
            "There are no self made mil/bill. Getting that rich always means hoarding ressources that others could benefit from otherwise.\nNow if we remove the \"self made\" part, yes it's totally possible. People have been using this playbook for centuries. But it will be at the expense of morality",

            "The answer to this is that they can't use legitimate advertising services. The biggest and network online is Google Display Network (GDN). GDN's terms of services do not allow you to place their ads alongside pornographic content. As a result they have to use other services that are less refined and much much much less profitable. They also have less stringent quality checks as a result of being such small companies/services.\n\nThe reason the ads are often spammy is that the more popups happen, by tricking you to click, or by having multiple on a video, the more money the site gets. If you want to avoid clicking on those, fun fact: a lot of the time the video isn't on the page until all the ads go, so if you find and delete the and overlay in WebDev Tools you can avoid the as.

What that means is that companies can block sites (pornhub, news sites, etc) or they can block keywords (trump, shooting, breast)\n\nThere are many reasons that an advertiser would choose to block an ad, but blocking ads on porn sites is because we don\u2019t want to be associated with it (for example, if someone sees an ad next to an article about a shooting, they will think that the advertiser is monetizing a shooting). The same applies to porn- if people see an advertiser monetizing something they don\u2019t agree with (lots of political stuff mostly) then they will sometimes publicly call out a company.\n\nIf you look up SleepingGiants on twitter and scroll through you will see some examples of this.\n\nThis is why the ads are mostly non reputable companies who can\u2019t have the same standards due to less ad money to spend (so they have to advertise in sketchier spots / cant block anything as that is something you pay for).",

            ">The pain results from irregular contraction (spasm) of the genioglossus and geniohyoid muscles. The mechanism is exactly the same as any cramp in any other muscle in the body. When we yawn, we have a tendency to contract and elevate the tongue. This causes contraction of its muscles, which can trigger the spasm and pain.\n\n>One trick that you can try is to consciously relax your tongue when yawning, letting it just sit flat on the floor of the mouth. This typically prevents the spasm, and after a while, it becomes a habit and the condition disappears.",

Under your jaw you have a bone called the hyoid that your tongue attaches to. It's the only bone in the body that isn't attached to other bones. It helps us control our speech with great precision, and is likely a big part of our evolution (since communication was key to human evolution). Sometimes when you yawn really hard, the bone can slip out below your jaw/chin, and it hurts and feels really really weird. It usually is accompanied by a cramp.

Also, we aren't that mobile compared to birds, so some plants want mammals to not mess with them. Capsaicin turned out to be a chemical that fools mammal pain receptors.\n\nIt's not just the butthole and mouth that is sensitive. It's all mucous membrane or thin tissue. Don't touch your genitals after cutting up super spicy peppers. Thicker parts of the skin don't burn because there, the top layer of skin is a protective barrier of dead skin cells.\n\nNow why so many humans like spicy food even when it is designed to be something we hate is a more complicated and potentially debatable question.",

            ">Why on earth can our butthole taste spiciness??\n\nIt can't. Spiciness is not a taste. Capsaicin irritates soft tissues like mucous membranes. It is pain; an irritant. Not a flavour. \n\nThere's a reason pepper spray hurts your eyes as well. Your skin is about the only thing that can handle it (for a short while) and that's because your skin is made to endure a lot\n\n>What\u2019s the point of that? Is this something that helped with survival before?\n\nIt did, and still does help with survival... For the pepper. Evolution isn't always on your side. That blade cuts both ways. We didn't evolve around peppers, but peppers evolved around mammals\n\nPeppers want their seeds to spread by having animals eat them, and poop em out elsewhere. Mammals, the A-holes, chew their food and crush these seeds in the process\n\nPeppers, evolutionarily speaking, don't want this, so they evolved to have an irritant in them that would be most potent if the seeds were destroyed. \n\nThat irritant is capsaicin. \n\nAnd it does steer a lot of people away from peppers\n\nThe reason humans flock to peppers as a cultivar is a bit more contentious. But, one thing is for certain: Everyone's a Bit of a Masochist. \n\nWhat I mean by that, is that in a controlled environment, feeling pain is not a bad thing for you. When you eat something like a habanero (not that hot, but still a buzz) you feel a controlled amount of pain. \n\nOnce you triumph over that pain, your brain releases endorphins, and dopamine. In otherwords, your brain goes \"do it again, do it again\", because it thinks you just came out of a near death experience, and that is good.",

This is things like cold, pain, pressure, etc. The rectum is where you transition from your visceral/gut nerves to your somatic/skin nerves. This transition is called the dentate line.

            "spiciness is not a taste.\n\nUnlike sweetness, saltiness and sourness, spiciness is a sensation. When we eat spicy food,  certain compounds in the food stimulate receptors in our mouth called Polymodal Nociceptors and trigger a reaction. \n\nThe funny thing is, Polymodal Nociceptors aren\u2019t designed to detect spice compounds, but instead, designed to detect heat. These receptors are what gives us that burning sensation when we eat something that is too hot like scalding hot soup which you didn\u2019t let cool down. This is why when we eat spicy food, we start to sweat and crave ice-cold water \u2013 because our mouth literally feels like it is burning.  The opposite applies to foods like mint, which contain menthol in it. Menthol activates the receptors in our mouth responsible for detecting coolness, giving as that cool, fresh sensation. \n\nAnd to answer your question there are TRPV1(Polymodal Nociceptors) receptors are all over your body, because any body part might bump the hot stove. Like with any amount of heat the body detects, your body attempts to cool down when you eat spicy food. That's why you have reactions like sweating that are more frequently triggered by a hot summer day or bustling kitchen.\n\nAs you might have guessed at this point, there are TRPV1 receptors in your anus.

            "Fun fact: Your anal tissue develops from the exact same epidermal tissue that forms your mouth lining. Being able to taste spiciness on the way in is useful, so most of us have evolved it to some degree due to natural selection over hundreds of thousands of years. The anal fire is just a secondary evolutionary fail due to shared embryological tissue develop.\n\nAnd before anyone says, but evolution never leads to fails, it actually does quite often. The common example many biology students are taught is the recurrent laryngeal nerve of the giraffe where a neck nerve has slowly evolved to be metres long down the neck and then loop back on itself up the entire neck, rather than just be an inch across. Natural selection merely works by environmental factors acting on existing structures, functions and behaviours, and then favouring certain features over others. Sometimes those features aren't great or they are downright crappy (even from the start).\n\nOther examples:\n\n1. Humans have a breathing system that evolved from a digestive system, causing thousands to choke to death each year.\n2. Humans have a remnant tail bone, the coccyx, which almost every human has painfully slammed onto when sitting down hard at some point or another. Many break it leading to significant issues.\n3. A human spine is suited to walking on all fours due to our primate ancestry, causing millions of people to develop lower back and other back issues from standing/walking upright and bending over often, particularly later in life.\n4. Male pattern baldness\n5. Eyeball blind spots due to our optic nerve connecting into the light sensitive retina (Fun fact: Cephalopods such as squid had their eyeballs evolve separately to ours, and they have no blindspot at all because their optic nerve connects behind the retina).",

These receptors can be found all throughout our digestive tract, since it's generally good to know if there's something hot in our bowels, since that could be dangerous. Again, however, they can't tell the difference between actual heat and capsaicin, so they get set off as the leftover capsaicin from the spicy food moves through your bowels and out your rectum.\n\nSo really, there's no evolutionary advantage to feeling spice in your butthole. There is an evolutionary advantage to feeling heat in your butthole, however, and the way your butthole senses heat can't tell the difference between spice and heat. Hope that makes sense.",

            "Evolved traits aren't always beneficial and don't always give us an advantage. I think that's a common myth, that everything we evolved helped us survive.\n\nNope. Sometimes these weird traits are just there, because there was no pressure for or against them. They just stayed because there was no reason to go away.\n\nFor instance, someone could have been born with an extra nostril and because it doesn't really do anything to help or hinder, that person is able to mate and pass on the third nostril gene.\n\nYou should look at those deep brain AI videos where a model learns to walk. They evolve weird behaviors like randomly flailing their arms or heads as they walked. \nAt some point in learning to walk, they flailed and it didn't cause backwards progress, so they kept on flailing even though it wasn't actually doing anything for them."

            "There are plenty of jokes throughout the Bible.\n\nThe Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) is especially full of puns and wordplay. Many names of figures in the Torah, for example, are puns based on their personality or character (such as the name \"Adam\" coming from the Hebrew word for man (adam)). One interpretation for the name \"Jacob\", for example, is \"the deceiver\", which is true to the way Jacob is presented as a man who tricks his brother, and later his father. Or how Jacob's brother Esau (meaning \"red\") was reportedly given that name because he was born with red hair (Genesis 25:25). Jacob and Esau, however, were alternate names for nations (Israel and Edom) that were around when the Torah was believed to have been composed, so it is likely Jacob and Esau as personifications for Israel and Edom was a later concept, and that the explanation given in Genesis for why they were named Jacob and Esau was also a later addition, as the actual origins behind the names would have been lost.\n\nThere are also instances in which figures portrayed in the Bible are being shown telling jokes. Such as when Elijah challenged the prophets of the Canaanite god Baal to see which god is more powerful, Yahweh (God), or Baal. Both Elijah and the prophets of Baal set up fire pits and invoked the names of their god to light a fire for them. Though Elijah's prayer successfully ended with lightning striking the pit and starting a fire, the prophets of Baal were unable to start a fire. This led to Elijah taunting them, telling them they must not be invoking Baal hard enough, or that perhaps maybe their god is taking a break (1 Kings 18:27), some translations of this story have Elijah saying Baal is too busy relieving himself.\n\nMoreover, the prophecies in general are full of puns and wordplay, especially in the Book of Hosea. In Hosea, God tells the prophet Hosea to marry a prostitute and have several children with her, all of the names of the children are puns reflecting God's anger toward Israel and Judah. One of Hosea's children, for example, is named Lo-ruhamah (literally meaning \"not pitied\") God's explanation for the name, rather appropriately, is \"for I will no longer have pity on the house of Israel or forgive them\" (Hosea 1:6). Puns and metaphors are often used in the prophetic books to emphasis the anger of God (there are several instances in which Israel is compared to God's cheating wife, or a prostitute)\n\nOverall, there are plenty of instances spliced within the narrative of the Hebrew Bible (and I'm sure there are also instances in the New Testament, I just can't think of any off the top of my head) of puns and word play being used as literary devices.",
            "When Peter is preaching to a crowd in Acts, people are taken aback by how passionate he is about this new theology, so they accuse him of being drunk.

Much of the back and forth in chapter four is also pretty funny.

[**6**](http://biblehub.com/luke/1-6.htm)Both of them were righteous in the sight of God, observing all the Lord\u2019s commands and decrees blamelessly.  [**7**](http://biblehub.com/luke/1-7.htm)But they were childless because Elizabeth was not able to conceive, and they were both very old.\n\n[**8**](http://biblehub.com/luke/1-8.htm)Once when Zechariah\u2019s division was on duty and he was serving as priest before God,  [**9**](http://biblehub.com/luke/1-9.htm)he was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to go into the temple of the Lord and burn incense.  [**10**](http://biblehub.com/luke/1-10.htm)And when the time for the burning of incense came, all the assembled worshipers were praying outside.\n\n[**11**](http://biblehub.com/luke/1-11.htm)Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense.  [**12**](http://biblehub.com/luke/1-12.htm)When Zechariah saw him, he was startled and was gripped with fear.  [**13**](http://biblehub.com/luke/1-13.htm)But  the angel said to him: \u201cDo not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has  been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to call  him John.  [**14**](http://biblehub.com/luke/1-14.htm)He will be a joy and delight to you, and many will rejoice because of his birth,  [**15**](http://biblehub.com/luke/1-15.htm)for  he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He is never to take wine or  other fermented drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even  before he is born.

[**17**](http://biblehub.com/luke/1-17.htm)And  he will go on before the Lord, in the spirit and power of Elijah, to  turn the hearts of the parents to their children and the disobedient to  the wisdom of the righteous\u2014to make ready a people prepared for the  Lord.\u201d\n\n**(Here's the joke set up - holy guy, spent his life in the Temple, angel of God went to the trouble to appear, yea verily, and talk to him and what does he say?)**  [**18**](http://biblehub.com/luke/1-18.htm)Zechariah asked the angel, \u201cHow can I be sure of this? I am an old man and my wife is well along in years.\u201d\n\n[**19**](http://biblehub.com/luke/1-19.htm)The  angel said to him, \u201cI am Gabriel. **(You dope.)** I stand in the presence of God, and I  have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news. *(Imagine Robin Williams playing the Genie and reading that line.

They realized he had seen a  vision in the temple, for he kept making signs to them but remained  unable to speak.\n\n[**23**](http://biblehub.com/luke/1-23.htm)When his time of service was completed, he returned home.

[**25**](http://biblehub.com/luke/1-25.htm)\u201cThe Lord has done this for me,\u201d she said. \u201cIn these days he has shown his favor and taken away my disgrace among the people.\u201d\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n[**57**](http://biblehub.com/luke/1-57.htm)When it was time for Elizabeth to have her baby, she gave birth to a son.

He is to be called John.\u201d\n\n[**61**](http://biblehub.com/luke/1-61.htm)They said to her, \u201cThere is no one among your relatives who has that name.\u201d\n\n[**62**](http://biblehub.com/luke/1-62.htm)Then they made signs to his father, to find out what he would like to name the child.  [**63**](http://biblehub.com/luke/1-63.htm)He asked for a writing tablet, and to everyone\u2019s astonishment he wrote, \u201cHis name is John.\u201d  [**64**](http://biblehub.com/luke/1-64.htm)Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue set free, and he began to speak, praising God.  [**65**](http://biblehub.com/luke/1-65.htm)All the neighbors were filled with awe, and throughout the hill country of Judea people were talking about all these things.  \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nTHEN, in the verses after this, Zechariah finally does what he should have done 9 months ago after a freakin' angel came to talk to him and he sang praise to God, etc., etc. \n\nI've always liked this story because of the contrast between Mary and Zechariah. Mary was probably 15 or 16, because women got engaged young in those days, and her reaction to an angel showing up to tell her important stuff was \"OK. I believe you.\"\n\nThis old guy who's been going to Temple for 50-something years, what does he do? *He wants to argue with the angel.* I have a strange sense of humor, I know I do, but to me, that's funny. \n\nAnd what was Gabriel's response? **\"OK, shut up man.

            "I always see these posts and wonder how to find these jobs! Every office job I've had has wanted me to fit 10 hours of work into my 8 hour day.",
            "\"I'd say in a given week I probably only do about fifteen minutes of real, actual, work.\"",
            "I have a small business and someone is hybrid - 50% in the field and 50% in the office.   When they are in the office they probably work 2 hours max.   The reason I pay them full time is because when they have a task it\u2019s urgent.  When a client emails or calls they need to fix it right away.  We have easy af tasks that are time sensitive.   I know it can be  boring so we have a big screen, comfie chairs, stocked fridge, encourage doing hobbies (the person doing the roll loves to water color paint and crochet) and I have no issues with this.  \n\nOur clients absolutely gush and love this- if there is an issue it\u2019s immediately solved, the person is cross trained in the field and can pop out and also resolve issues that need immediate attention as well.  Our competitors make people wait days to have things resolved or don\u2019t resolve them at all.  \n\nIt makes my job so much easier.  I do the other 50% of the work.  I can now have solid days off without time sensitive immediate need to resolve tasks and issues as well.   Imagine I can take actual time off and now fully disconnect.  \n\nAnyway that\u2019s the reason and it\u2019s absolutely worth my money to dedicate to the roll.",

            "I work in IT and I know what you're talking about.  If you're happy where you are, then it's fine.  Basically, it's on you to improve yourself and try to climb the ladder.  It sounds like you have potential to move up.  \n\nThat's something you could actually bring up with your boss.  Say you'd be interested in more challenging opportunities, if the title and salary would match.  (Be sure that you actually want more responsibility first though!)",
            "[This study](https://www.vouchercloud.com/resources/office-worker-productivity) shows your numbers are pretty average. [This article](https://www.glamour.com/story/how-much-work-are-we-supposed-to-do-at-work) also mentions a study that showed \"bosses didn\u2019t know which workers were actually working 80, and which were working 50 or 60. They just preferred the workers who appeared to do 80 hours.\"\n\nOf course it varies on your actual job, but it seems pretty common for office work to not actually require the time set aside for it. Some people choose to never point this out to their superiors because it results in more and more work being piled on until it's actually too much to get done. Even if it's just the \"right\" amount to fit into your hours, not taking any breaks will cause burnout. \"[Microbreaks](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20190312-the-tiny-breaks-that-ease-your-body-and-reboot-your-brain)\" like checking your phone for a couple minutes or having a small chat with a coworker actually allow you to better focus on your work when you go back to it.\n\nAs long as your work is getting done and is good quality, try not to worry too much. You can always ask for an extra project or something more challenging if you want to work your way up and improve your skills. Chances are your coworkers are in a similar boat.",
            "I know the feeling, but I think it\u2019s pretty normal. I started working from home in 2016 and for the longest time felt like I was not earning my salary because I was really only actively working a few hours out of most days. But, when I thought about it, I came to the conclusion that I was doing the same amount of work I had been doing when in the office, it\u2019s just that I\u2019d always equated physical presence in the office as work. In other words, I felt I was \u201cworking\u201d nine hours every day. When I acknowledged the fact that even when I was in the office, I was frequently not working (maybe chatting with coworkers, having a snack or reading the news), I became more comfortable with my work-from-home situation and the fact that I (and I suspect most people) wasn\u2019t truly working every minute of the \u201cworkday.\u201d",
            "I envy you so much. I just started an office job 3 months ago and I absolutely hate it. Emails and phone calls all day and there\u2019s never an end to the amount of people to contact. Not to mention my boss sits right behind me so forget phone usage or going on any websites for something not relevant to the job",
            "As you continue to progress in your career and eventually have to manage people under you, remember how you feel now. This is what it feels like to be correctly managed and staffed. If someone with a desk job is absolutely slammed 9-5 day after day, they will become fatigued, develop burnout, make small mistakes that can cascade into big problems, etc.",
            "Yes.  Sometimes less than that.  I have known entire organizations that didn't do work at all.  Their boss needed a certain number of employees to maintain his position and they served that purpose.",
            "If your boss gives you 3 days to do a job that takes you 30 minutes, **do not hand it in after 30 minutes** - unless you are happy with the possibility that you or your colleagues may very quickly be out of a job.\n\nSure, there's maybe *some* room for improvement, but most bosses and companies will realise the work can be done by 1 person in 30 minutes, fire everyone else, then pile a load more work onto you with no pay increases.\n\nIt sounds mean, but most companies only care about money. They will absolutely screw you over to take advantage of you.\n\n/Edit\n\nThis advice is meant for people who want a slightly morally-grey, steady job and aren't looking to constantly move onto the next big thing. \n\nIf you're happy automating all your work into a Powershell script, and getting Janice in accounting who's been at the company for 20 years fired because her entire job can be replaced with an Excel macro, before moving onto somewhere else that actually *needs* you then go for it. \n\nIf you're happy where you are, and don't feel bad about earning a living wage while your boss is driving to another golf game in his $500k Mercedes, then keep quiet and make the most of it until the boredom sends you looking for a new job.",
            "It is pretty normal in a lot of office settings. Sometimes they inadvertently promote slow work. I remember working hard like you did at a job, finishing up work well before due dates. So, they rewarded me by giving me more work to do and promoting me.  I ended up being way too much. I learned to just do things by the deadline and you will be just fine.",
            "It's the worlds greatest kept secret, everyone pretends otherwise and thinks they're one of the few that get away with it. In reality, most people do fuck all the entire day and there's about 5% of people in the office stopping the place from falling apart entirely. It's a beautiful thang, hope it never changes.\n\nSometimes I feel bad for the 5%, but eventually you realize that they do it to themselves most of the time.",
            "These stories make me so jealous. I work skilled trades. Every minute is spent working",
            "2 hours seems a little on the low side, but for the most part that's working in an office. And I don't think most places expect you to only work during the 9-5, it would be almost impossible to be a functional person if work was the only thing you did that entire time.\n\nI mean I have the type of job where it would literally be impossible to work entirely all 8 hour 5 days a week. It's just not that kind of job but they want me in the office so that's where I am. \n\nBut also time spent not working on work tasks is work tangential. Like talking to co-workers? That's work in my mind, team building. Getting coffee? Well that's getting ready for work, so that's work. Being on my phone for an hour? Well as long you check some news vaguely related to your industry/field then that's keeping up to date on current events, wouldn't want to get blindsided by anything. \n\nHonestly most for the most part I feel like I'm being paid to do my responsibilities and the 9-5 is just a means for me to get paid to do them",
            "My experience with office jobs is that sometimes the work can be super fast and only need a couple of hours a day, and other times there's huge amounts of it and it'll take the whole working day or longer to get it done.\n\nOne thing I would say is to use the down time to find other work to do, help other folk out, learn what other folk do. If you do that, it'll give you a real leg up when it comes to advancement within the company.",
            "I'm an IT PM. I actually \"work\" maybe 2-3 hours a day unless we're gearing up for a major project, then it's the full 8 or more. Shit gets done, so what does it matter?",
            "I can do 80% of my job in 20% of the time. Some things can also be simple but tedious which take a lot of time. And sometimes I just bullshit with coworkers. They\u2019re paying you to be available when work comes up. Not necessarily to be working hard for 8 hours straight.\n\nAlso, check out the movie Office Space.",
            "I had a four minute period a few years ago when I wasn\u2019t busy.",
            "If you're smart and even slightly motivated yes that happens.  However, as someone who supervises a lot of people I can tell you that some people will get the same assignment and same time limit and cry that it isn't long enough.",
            "So Im not a standard office worker, my work is based in a lab. But in reality I do a lot of office-type work. When it's busy it's VERY busy. But during weeks when there's no analysis planned I write a bunch of reports, random documentation, order materials or watch some webinar to brush up on my skills. I could take my sweet-ass time and procrastinate for half my day and my boss would still praise me for getting so many things done. It's kinda wild to me because I feel like a fraud.\n\nI noticed though that my coworkers who have been working there much longer than me procrastinate for literally half their day every day, browsing stuff online or reading blogs. They told me that newbies always feel like they should be working their entire day but eventually that slows down. So I guess it's normal.",

That\u2019s the epitome of working smarter, not harder.  \nFind a personal side project that is close enough to what you are paid to do so it\u2019s not obvious you\u2019re coasting from a casual glance, or train yourself up on software or something under the guise of developing your skillset, and you\u2019ll not only continue to get paid, you might even get praised for your appearance of having initiative and a strong work ethic.\n\nJust this last year I learned how to use 2D and 3D computer modeling software entirely on the company dime while being praised for how I never missed a deadline and was always at my desk working away.

When I was in college I worked as a PowerPoint slave in a marketing agency (created multiple decks all day everyday) I am just very good at PowerPoint and that carried me through all my career to where I am now. My bosses always thought I spend all the time, creating these nice looking content and articulate projects visually. They all think I am like a super structured person with discipline and ask my help with their projects. What I do is just take their content make it nicer, visually appealing and just rewrite their wordings in short sentences and they think I contribute to their projects heavily. Takes me 30-60 minutes to do that. Worst part of my workday is to sit in project meetings and time to time make comments. I block most of my calendar so they can't just fill my day with meetings. \n\nto be honest, I spent the last 3 months planning on my outdoor diy pizza oven project.

I actually had a job like this for about a year, I didn\u2019t go into the office for days at a time, especially when my boss was on PTO. I would lay in bed until I got an email to respond to and if it required my laptop I\u2019d get up and respond to it while watching Netflix.  \nThen Covid came along and I *had* to work from home. I got bored pretty quick and had the realization that I wanted to do something more in case I ever needed to go job hunting and ended up switching teams. Now I put in about 6 hours a day, but it came with a raise, new learning opportunities, and I still work from home.  \nEnjoy it while you can, but be aware it can go away at any time, especially if it\u2019s realized how much you are actually working.",
            "Social studies teacher here.\n\nGenerally speaking, the total productivity of a business or organisation is inherently unequally divided. In fact, half of the productivity comes from the square root of all contributors.\n\nThis means that in a business of 100 people, 10 people will be doing half the work.\n\nIn a business of 1000 people, 30 people will be doing half the work.\n\nThis is only generally true, so there will be companies that don't exactly work like this. But it is true in general. So is it weird that you only work 2-3 hours? Nope. It's VERY normal.

I was easily exceeding expectations and got 4 raises over a years time but ended up doing 3 people's work because of short staffing. The work load burnt me out and I started sleeping through my alarms I came into work 1-2hrs late a couple of times and they fired me as soon as they found someone to replace me(after I trained them ofc). Moral of the story is you can sit there and be content with the work load/money you are getting now or you can bust your ass and get screwed for it. Last time I work that hard for a corporate job. It sucks to even say that because I can't just sit at my desk and do nothing like others seem to have no problem doing. So yea worked myself to the bone every second I was there and got burnt out,  just to watch people play the clock. Extremely aggrevating. So the extra $6/hr really wasn't worth busting my ass to that degree when I could have been doing nothing half the day and been much happier.

I know that I can design a PowerPoint in half the time of most designers and obviously faster than non-designers. If they book me in to design a PowerPoint for 5 hours it's because they think it takes that long and they're charging the client for that amount of time. So If I complete it in 2.5 hours then why would I tell them I've done it faster? Next time around they will still charge the client for 5 hours, but only give me 2.5 hours to complete it.
