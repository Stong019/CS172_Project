            "Use dish soap to wash your walls (add a squirt to warm water, dip a rag in there and wipe your walls down), peanut butter is very oily and you need to break up those oils with dawn or other dish soap. Then mix equal parts water and white vinegar in a spray bottle (and add a few drops of essential oil if you want) and spray it on your walls and wipe. The smell of vinegar will go away after it dries, and vinegar is pretty good at neutralizing odors. Baking soda (used separately from vinegar) is also a good odor neutralizer, but I think it would probably scratch up the paint on your wall. After that, I don't know what else to recommend aside from airing out the room and burning candles.\n\nedit: can't believe this is my most upvoted comment of all time",

            "I don't avoid places because of this and it's not something I'm \\*constantly\\* thinking about... but like yesterday, I was out getting my hair done and was left to let the color process so I had downtime for my brain to wander. I had the thought \"What if someone just comes in and starts shooting everyone? My phone is on the other side of the salon.\" I knew it was unlikely, I didn't have anxiety about it, but the thought occurred. Sometimes when I see an ambulance or a fire truck pull up at my son's school, I have a moment of worry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit to add: After multiple comments I decided to clarify. I do not think my phone would save me. Obviously I would try to run or hide, panic would kick in. If I had the opportunity to text or call my family to let them know what's going on or call 911 though, that is why I thought about my phone. I do not actively plan for a shooter situation when I leave my house, it was a random thought that occurred. \n\nOP asked if anyone was afraid to go out in public. I gave a personal response to say that no, I am not afraid to go in public and it's not something I worry about all the time, plan for or go out of my way to stay home but given the state of things, yes I do think about it and worry from time to time.",

I was very paranoid about getting attacked or shot at, but turns out everyone is super nice\n\nI then visited a gun range to shoot a gun for the first time. I thought they would be racist towards me as I am Chinese and I read on reddit that people from Ohio are racist. Turns out they are all super nice people and very friendly. \n\nI guess my point is don\u2019t let the internet bubble give you such constant fear that you\u2019re scared of living life.",
            "I'm more worried about driving on the highway in Mississippi than anything else. Between the bad roads and lack of driver's ed., that's by far the most dangerous thing I do daily.",
            "I had to hide with 20-something other kids in our classroom when I was a freshman in high school because some absolute freak disguised himself as a student just to start shooting once he was inside. 2 kids died. I was on the other side of the school and was about as far away from everything as possible, but I only learned that after the fact.\n\nKnowing there was a *real* active shooter in the school was like no other panic I've ever had. I had to grapple with my own mortality if the guy opened the door - sure it was locked, but *he had a gun*. I wrote a goodbye text to my mom, telling her how much I loved her and the rest of my family, and outlining what I wanted her to do with my body and belongings if I died, but I never sent it. I just sat there in silence on the floor, pushed up against my friends and classmates in the silence, just watching the door. \n\nThe aftermath was almost worse. 2 kids had been killed and then the guy took the easy way out, so there would never be any justice for them. Every other kid ended up with anxiety of some kind, and things only got worse the closer you were to the scene. *Classrooms on that side of the school had to evacuate by passing the dead bodies in the hallway.* Our entire town was in shambles. \n\nIt turned out that the FBI had put the shooter on a watchlist because he'd been posting so much about how he wanted to open fire somewhere crowded and take out as many people as possible. Apparently being on an FBI watchlist doesn't keep you from buying a gun and then shooting people the next morning.\n\nEver since then I've been afraid to go into crowded, public places. The rest of high school was a nightmare for obvious reasons, even after I moved hours away. I don't like going to malls because they're too wide open. I don't like grocery stores because they'd be impossible to escape. I don't like to go downtown because there's so many people. I don't go out for drinks because what if I'm not even *sober* and I end up in a shooting? \n\nEvery time I go into a building I'm thinking about sight lines and looking for fire doors and hiding places. I'm in college now, and the days directly after a shooting it's hard to make myself go to my classes. My school shooting happened years ago and I was nowhere near the actual trauma but it fucked me up anyways. Every time there's a new shooting it's really hard not to end up getting a panic attack because it just brings up all those experiences again to the front of my brain, instead of buried under other shit in the back.\n\nThe actual odds of being caught up in an active shooter situation are really extremely low. Most places on most days are as peaceful as ever, and the vast majority of people out there are decent, normal people. I just happened to get lucky, I guess. I hope you can avoid living in extreme fear like I do despite the news being the enemy to people's mental health. It sucks not feeling okay enough to go out and do fun things, or getting to do them and having awful thoughts all the time, and I hope you can go forward with some therapy about it because that definitely helps.",

The fact that someone can start shooting any soft target they want is certainly there, but the chances they'll do it where you are when you're there is mathematically not worth thinking about.

            "No. Not scared.\n\nBut this will continue to happen until the root causes are addressed. The root cause is not guns by the way\n\nGuns have always been prevalent in the US. But the mass shooting issue has risen in the last 30 or so years\n\nAlso in that time\u2026\n\nCost of living has far outpaced wages\n\nWe have gone from a place where A person with a high-school diploma could support a family and own a house and a car with a good high paying manufacturing job. Now there are jobs requiring masters degrees where the pay is just 15 an hour\n\nMost households are paycheck to paycheck and are just one paycheck away from homelessness\n\nWe have now 2 generations of Americans who have spent at least half their life with the US at war against \u201cterror.\u201d A faceless enemy that could be around any corner, thus raised to be in constant fear\n\n\nWhatever changes to child rearing and schooling that has happened over the past 30-40 years, we have an ever growing number of young Americans with the emotional maturity of toddlers. And, like toddlers, lash out with aggression when they don\u2019t know how to process emotions \n\nThe mass shooting epidemic isn\u2019t a simple fix. We want it to be but it isn\u2019t. Unless we, as a society, address these issues to create some stability while maintaining liberty, it won\u2019t get better",
            "Everybody saying \"You're extremely unlikely to ever be harmed in a mass shooting\" is wrong. You don't have to be shot, or even be at the site of violence to be deeply psychologically harmed by an event like this. When a mass shooting takes place anywhere in your community, you are psychologically harmed. When a mass shooting takes place and somebody you know is tangentially related to it, you are harmed. The secondary effects of these kind of events are large, and wide spread. \n\nI try not to live in fear, but to pretend like a decade of these events becoming a regular occurrence doesn't impact the way you feel in public is just denial of reality. You're not crazy for feeling this way OP, but you should definitely talk to a therapist about it as others have suggested. I've certainly talked to my therapist about it.",
            "No never. I always feel safe. Been living in the US my whole life. Don\u2019t let the media think everything is dangerous or a war zone or you\u2019re gonna get shot when you step outside. It\u2019s fine",

            " Our minds are constantly vying for our attention. In evolutionary psychology there is a theory of mind called the Modular Mind. This theory states there are 9 different \"modules\" in our mind that are always running, and sending us unconscious messages to act on something or to think about something or a combination of both. The idea is that all of these modules are working towards our survival either socially or physically - anything that can be done to ensure our survival and our genes are passed on. \n\nAlso, when we are not preoccupied with an activity or something to do, our Default Mode Network is active. This has been demonstrated to be active when we are daydreaming or, as you mention it, laying in bed at 2am with nothing to \"do\". \n\nOur minds are constantly generating thoughts and feelings. It is the brains job to do so, like it's the hearts job to pump blood and the lungs job to breathe air. \n\nThe feeling to do something with your life could be a symptom of an active healthy brain that is currently \"directionless\" and without a task. In modern life today it's very uncommon for people to just stop and sit with their minds. It's also even more uncommon for people to sit with their minds and not associate every thought they have with themselves, instead seeing the thoughts as just thoughts that will always come and go. Whether or not we pay attention to them is (mostly) up to us. \n\nJournaling or meditating, or as some posters have mentioned, going outside for 20 mins and just looking up at the stars and letting your mind run free, is a good remedy for a busy mind. \n\nTo learn more about this stuff I recommend investigating the works of Robert Wright (Why Buddhism is True) or others in the cognitive science/evolutionary psychology community.",

He would wash up and change in the garage and do his own laundry because that was a foul smelling job, and the smells bothered her greatly.  He did not say I am the man of the house and this is how we pay bills.  He simply did it because it was a reasonable request. \n\nMy wife talks to me about things that I do that bother her.  I take her point of view into consideration and take action where I can usually.  Even if I think they are silly requests, they meant enough for her to say it.

These things can add up over time and you never know what could be the final thing or just a series of things and then things get unrecoverable.

            "This is from https://thompsontee.com/blog/medical-conditions-that-cause-body-odor/\n\n\n7 Medical Conditions That Cause Body Odor\n\n\nMost body odor can be\u00a0managed\u00a0with proper hygiene. Keeping your body clean, applying deodorant, and wearing fresh clothing can help manage your body odor. However, body odor caused by certain medical conditions can be persistent problems \u2014 even with stellar hygiene practices.\n\n\n\n7 MEDICAL CONDITIONS THAT CAUSE BODY ODOR\n\nWhat diseases can cause bad body odor? Beyond hygiene, there are certain cases where diseases or medical conditions can alter a person\u2019s body odor. Here are some of the top medical conditions that cause body odor.\n\n1. Bromhidrosis\n\nBromhidrosis\u00a0is a medical condition that causes extreme body odor. It occurs when your skin\u2019s bacteria breaks down sweat and produces an abnormal smell that mimics sulfur or onions. There are two types of bromhidrosis: apocrine and eccrine.\n\nApocrine bromhidrosis is the most common type, causing excessive odor in your armpits and genital areas. This odor happens when sweat from apocrine glands mixes with skin bacteria, creating a smell that can resemble onions, sulfur or raw meat.Eccrine bromhidrosis is a lesser-known form of bromhidrosis, causing smelly sweat on the hands, feet, head and torso. This odor happens when sweat from eccrine glands softens the skin\u2019s keratin, breaking down bacteria that produce excessive odor.2. Hyperhidrosis\n\nHyperhidrosis\u00a0causes your body to sweat more than normal. While hyperhidrosis doesn\u2019t cause odor itself, excessive sweating mixes with your body\u2019s bacteria creating embarrassing body odor. There are two main types of hyperhidrosis: primary and secondary.\n\nPrimary hyperhidrosis causes excessive sweat in one body area, like the underarms, hands, feet, head and groin. It\u2019s usually hereditary and affects approximately 5% of the population.Secondary hyperhidrosis is excessive sweating caused by a medical condition or certain medications. Secondary hyperhidrosis causes all-over sweating and can be reversed if the underlying medical cause is resolved or eliminated. We\u2019ll talk about some of these medical conditions in this article.\n\nSome medications whose side effects can include excessive sweating are:\n\nAntidepressants (Pamelor, Norpramin, Protriptyline)Pilocarpine (used to treat dry mouth)Zinc supplementsIron supplements3. Diabetes\n\nDiabetes patients often experience additional medical complications. Diabetes-related urinary tract infections (UTIs) and high levels of blood glucose can increase body odor. Diabetic ketoacidosis is a life-threatening condition in which your body lacks insulin, depriving cells of the sugar they need for energy. One of the symptoms is a distinct, fruity breath smell.\n\nContact your physician for medical advice immediately if you suspect you have diabetic ketoacidosis.\n\n4. Thyroid Conditions\n\nThyroid glands regulate many bodily functions, including our sweat response. When you have hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) or Grave\u2019s disease, your body can produce an excessive amount of sweat, even if you aren\u2019t exerting yourself.\n\n5. Kidney Failure and Liver Dysfunction\n\nThe kidneys and liver help remove toxins from our bodies. When they cannot function properly, toxins can build up in the blood and digestive tract, creating odor. Kidney disease can cause urea to make your sweat take on an ammonia smell.\n\nIf you suspect that you have a thyroid, kidney or liver condition, talk to a healthcare professional promptly.\n\n6. Metabolic Disorders\n\nWhile this is incredibly rare, gene mutations can also affect body odor.\n\nTrimethylaminuria, or TMAU, is a disease that prevents your liver from breaking down the chemical compound trimethylamine. Trimethylamine can be fishy-smelling or reek of eggs or urine. When your body cannot break down this compound, it builds up in your body and is released in your sweat, urine and breath.\n\nSecondary trimethylaminuria can occur if you take large oral doses of L-carnitine, lecithin or choline. Lecithin and choline are contained in some food supplements. L-carnitine is sometimes used to enhance athletes' strength, and choline treats Alzheimer\u2019s and Huntington\u2019s disease. Symptoms disappear when doses are reduced or eliminated.\n\n7. Hormones\n\nHormone fluctuations can cause excessive sweating and, by extension, body odor. Teens, pregnant women, and perimenopausal or menopausal women can experience hot flashes and night sweats, increasing excessive sweating and odor.",
            "Well over a decade ago I was in Afghanistan. And I heard grumblings about this one dude but I was barely paying attention. One day the big boss comes over to me and says, hey you're gonna take #$#$# back to the camp and make him get a shower.\n\nMe - \"uhhhhh...ok?\"\n\nHim - \"Yeah, like make sure he actually gets a shower.\"\n\nMe - \"uhhhhh, how am I gonna do that?\"\n\nHim - \"You're gonna stand outside the shower curtain and pass him the soap and make sure he's fucking washing his stank ass.\"\n\nMe - \"Ok, this is gonna be super weird but you're the boss. So. Ok.\"\n\nDrive his ass back to our camp, which was special - like spec ops dudes stayed there. AKA \"baby killers\" but I don't think that term is PC. I take him to his place he lived, so he could grab a uniform and soap and stuff. Take him to the shower tent.\n\nSo, I'm there. Not in shower apparel. In full uniform. Hanging out with this douchebag who couldn't wash himself right. With a bunch of scantily clad buff ass spec ops guys.\n\nI go pass the douche the soap. I get strange looks from the combat controllers/tacp guys. I just look at them straight faced and say, \"I'm not a fucking pervert fellas, this idiot doesn't understand washing himself and I was ordered to make sure he understood.\"\n\nOne laughed. One gave me the stink-eye. I just said, \"Like jesus christ I don't want to be in here just hanging out for fucks sake.\" Mr. stink-eye let up a bit.\n\nWhy did I tell this ridiculous story? Because dude had no idea that he stunk so goddamn bad it could make someone vomit. That conversation with your wife is not going to be fun regardless of how you bring it up or it turns out.\n\nwhat -I- would do, is hop in the shower with her and be like all affectionate and wash her yourself to see if it makes a difference. Sometimes people just have this sort of body chemistry that reeks.\n\nGood luck sir. Godspeed and soap bubbles.\n\nEdit: u/StonksStink All joking aside though, it's your wifey - so is this a recent thing? Or an always thing? because there are so many comments about maybe a medical disorder and they may be on point with that.",

            "One of my exs had this issue, and after trying everything, finally went to the doctor. It turned out to be a diet issue. She was not eating enough carbs, so her body was always breaking down proteins. A byproduct of breaking protein down into amino acids is Ammonia, which is the same chemical that makes cat pee smell. It can cause the sweat, and vaginal fluid to smell like cat pee. She resolved it by eating more carbs, and less protein, and using a special prescription-strength deodorant. Eventually it just went away.\n\nThere are also other disorders, such as Trimethylaminuria, also known as \u201cfish-odor syndrome\u201d. Trimethylamine is produced in the GI tract as a byproduct when bacteria breaks down certain foods. This byproduct smells like fish, urine, or rotten eggs. Normally the body converts this chemical into another less smelly chemical, but some people are unable to do so, and it builds up, causing rotten egg, fish, or urine-like body odors. There is no cure for this, but there are treatments to help with the symptoms.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nSide note: this same ex pointed out that my breath started to smell really bad. It turned out that my wisdom teeth were impacted, and I had an infection in my gums. I have a high pain tolerance, and didn\u2019t notice, until she told me my breath smelled. She was afraid of upsetting me, but I got all 4 wisdom teeth extracted, and my mouth healed thanks to her. I had constant headaches, and didnt even realize my head hurt until my teeth were pulled and it stopped hurting. Like when you hear a sound, but dont notice until it stops? But with a constant headache.\n\nTL;dr: it could be medical, and you could be helping her by bringing it up, but be careful and sensitive to her reaction, because no one likes to hear that they smell.",
            "has she been to the doctor about it? there might be an underlying issue there. I would approach it as you are worried about her, because she shouldn\u2019t have a bad BO issue if she showers every day ( unless she goes for long runs afterwards for example)",

I\u2019m also sure in your relationship that you have bought something stupid and had to make it seem to make sense; use that technique when you speak to her. No matter how eloquently you broach the subject, there will be incoming fire. You\u2019ve taken it before with far less on the line. Good luck.",

During those periods, even after working out she\u2019d be smelly but nothing compared to the acrid stress sweats. \n\nSomeone else mentioned diet - I have some food intolerances and I\u2019ve noticed with my own BO that diet and stress seem to effect it. I definitely get some weird changes to my odour when I eat things I can\u2019t digest properly, and I have even more trouble digesting when I\u2019m stressed.",
            "I'm way down in comments and didn't see this one yet:  is she into sort of hippie granola products? Check that her deodorant is actually an antiperspirant and not just a deodorant. \n\nI don't know the science or what's right. But a lot of people believe aluminum causes breast cancer and a ton of women's deo brands have removed the aluminum. As a result the new product doesn't prevent sweating, but only masks odor. \n\nIn my experience, the deodorant only kind (aka NOT antiperspirant) tend to fail after just a couple hours.

I am a bigger woman and I know regular deodorant doesn\u2019t work for me and I have to use Old Spice because that kills the smell. She may need to do that. Also, she could have pH issues because it is safe to assume that because she smells so badly, she may be scrubbing a lot in her private area to prevent the smell. This is counteractive. Get her non scented soap bars for down there and tell her to use separate towels. One for body and on for privates.",
            "I agree with the posters who say she should get a checkup.  If by any chance it's coming from her breath, she may have a sinus/throat infection or infected tooth.

Ineffective deodorant. \n4. Bacteria on your clothes can lead to smelly pits when you wear a \u201cclean\u201d shirt fresh out of the laundry. Borax and enzyme pre-treat spray can help immensely. \n5. Certain medications can affect your scent. Some antidepressants, amphetamines, probably others I\u2019m not familiar with. \n6. Plenty of people lose their sense of smell post-Covid so she may not notice it. \n\nTl;dr - it may take a few different things to resolve the smell so it\u2019s imperative to be kind and loving as you work together to find a solution.

            "SOLUTION:\n\ud83e\udd14 \ud83d\udcdd Try Zinc Oxide cream (i.e. generic Diaper Rash Cream). You apply it under the arms and in the crevice of the legs once a week or every time you shower. Make sure it contains at least 40% zinc oxide.\n\nIs it safe? Yes, and we use it on babies every day.\n\n\nCONTEXT:\nYou\u2019re SO may have given up finding a solution, because one can only shower so many times in a day. You and she may not know that BO is a surface skin bacterial  issue where \ud83e\udda0 Corynebacterium and \ud83e\udda0 Staphylococcus strains manage to grow uncontrolled. They break down materials in sweat to produce alcohols and sulfurous byproducts. This is why BO smells like rotten eggs, lingers so long, and is so strong.\n\nThe bacteria colonies quickly build a thick hydrophobic layer that repels water; and attempts at washing them off the skin or out of the clothes they come in contact with are generally futile.\n\nDiaper rash cream is a fantastic topical antibacterial agent because of the zinc oxide. Don\u2019t worry about additionally using deodorant, this will replace it, and one $7 bottle from the baby section will last much longer than a deodorant stick.\n\nDETAILED DIRECTIONS:\nApply the cream with a paper towel/towelette under each armpit and in the upper crevice of each leg. If you wash it off in the shower, reapply. \n\nThe cream will come in contact with the inside of the clothes through normal use, and will address any lingering smells in clothes as well.\n\nOddly specific \u2018cause I (23M) was in your wife\u2019s shoes. Found this solution from a handful of studies published in Germany, if I remember correctly. Even found out there is a lab in the western U.S. where they transplant bacteria colonies from good smelling people to bad smelling people in an effort to rehabilitate their armpit.\n\nThe cream worked. My SO is impressed by the change. Now she uses it in her hygiene kit in place of deodorant sticks.\n\nTLDR: Your SO has BO. Use ZO cream (zinc oxide cream/diaper rash cream).\n\nEdit\u2014-Just talk to her\u2026",
            "BO is a big deal with my stepmom and shes pretty upfront about how hard it was for her growing up. This is what she does, and now I do, too:\n\n\n1. Get a deodorant soap, like Zest or Dial. The bar soap, NOT liquid. \n\n2. Lather your washcloth, not a sponge or loofah,  \n\n3. I shit you not, scrub those armpits with at LEAST 50 strokes per pit. \n\n4. Dry pits completely before applying deodorant. \nLike, pat them bone dry with the towel. \n\n5. Smell the towel. Does it stink? Then you stink. Repeat steps 1-4.\n\n\nIDK why this works but heres my theory:\n\nSome armpits have large pores that hold old deodorant sweat, and dead skin cells which contribute to odor. \nShe might not be scrubbing enough to get those areas really cleaned out. \nWet armpits let deodorant slide off. \nSecret clinical strength deodorant is a miracle worker (when applied to DRY pits)\n\nHTH",

Her choices have narrowed down to Delgado, for $4,388 per semester (tuition only), or Tulane, for $52,760 per semester.  \n\nBased on her income alone, which is less than 20K a year, there IS no solution for her at Tulane that doesn't involve eye-watering amounts of debt.  She is going to attend Delgado for a couple of years and see if she can manage to get a scholarship to Tulane.  If not, then she'll do what many people have - work fulltime and take a class here, a class there, and poof!  about a decade later, there's your Master's!\n\nYeah.  Pretty much a garbage system we got here.",

            "FAFSA benefits have always been income based and you need your parents tax information (along with your own) to file for it from the time you enter college until your 20 or 21. \n\nThe entire concept is a scam in my opinion. It's designed to keep poor families poor, while promoting wealthier families in much the same way the rest of the economy tends to work. Use family \"contributions\" based on the idea that all parents will support their children passed legal adulthood, which lowers the grant cost paid by the government. This approach also forces lower income family students to take out loans that have insane interest rates, putting them in extreme debt before they even have enough experience to start working. All of this is happening while wealthier families can afford more out of pocket expenses, utilize the meagre grant offered through FAFSA, and not need to take out the absurd loans. \n\nThe real reason this is an issue is because the US really doesn't care about uplifting poor and low income families. Also the capitalist economy has turned the right to education into a for profit business. Schools have astronomical tuition rates that average citizens can't afford without taking out the loans super high interest rates, which is good for  business, but bad for people. It is much the same as our healthcare system when you think about it.",

I was a poor kid at a school for rich kids and they would talk shit about how lucky poor people were to get the pell grant because their parents had to pay their tuition, and the poors were just lazy because they wouldn't work to put their kids through college.

            "The whole US education system seems like a mess and scam from my perspective, not living in the US. Here it's just free for citizens and for students coming from other EU countries but you pay for your own supplies like books, and it's affordable for people coming from outside the EU (I think it was like 1 or 2k a year?) so honestly you would be better off moving to a country with cheap/free education compared to the crazy expensive prices in the US. For like 40k per half a year you could get a nice apartment, eat fancy food or just pay rent for a normal sized place and eay not fancy food and just not be in debt (here). And you can apply for like money to support your studies if you come from a low income family or are living on your own. Education just shouldn't be for profit.",

            "Since the early 2000s, many institutions tuition prices have skyrocketed over the years because federal and state governments have pulled back their higher education funding. (Texas had tuition deregulation which allowed institutions to set their own tuition). With increased demand to attend college and decreased government funding, institutions needed an outlet for funding support. They turned to tuition from individual families. Unfortunately, federal and state financial aid such as grants have not kept up with the inflation of tuition so the prices fall on the students and their families leading to loads of student debt.",
            "Solutions are income based rather than universal because the former is cheaper. Cheaper to pay for students who can\u2019t afford it than pay for all of them. You are correct that this unfairly impacts students with parents that won\u2019t pay for their education.

I paid off my loans and bought a house, but I was so broke in my twenties and those loans. I would hate to do it over again.",
            "Completely agree with the OP. Let's get rid of this old school idea that higher education has anything at all to do with the income and assets of an 18 year old adult's parents. The 18 year old kid is legally an adult. He can go to work, he can vote, he can join the military, he can go to college. The first of those three things have nothing to do with your parents' income or assets, so neither should going to college. The FAFSA should calculate the cost of attendance, tell the student how much he is eligible for in financial aid (which in today's world is 90 percent student loans). We could perhaps still keep Pell grants in a different form in order to prevent the system from being regressive. Then, instead of having student loans which never get paid back, have a low education tax of like 3 percent of disposable income that you pay for like 30 years after you graduate. Sort of like the tax we all pay for Social Security and Medicare. You don't even notice it. Boom, you pay for your own education and everyone gets to go to school if they want to. If your parents want to pay, they are free to do that. That's cool if they do, but no one has to rely on their parents anymore.",
            "I had to pay all my community college tuition out of pocket because I couldn't get fin aid. I get it now but I had to wait till 27 to even get close enough distance to be considered separated financially from my parents. Its honestly mostly about greedy bastards millions upon millions are funneled through most colleges on the low end, and it doesn't really come back to the students. Some larger universities actually have slush funds of billions.",

            "It\u2019s because almost every law in America is designed to maintain a class divide so that the wealthy can accumulate generational wealth while being served by what amounts to a slave class trapped in debt and poverty with no means of social advancement.",
            "The goal is so that they give aid to those who need it most. There are options for financial aid and student loans for students who don\u2019t get help from family, but the logic is to give more financial aid to people who are most in need of it",
            "Absolutely! FASFA and all these other programs take a very brief look into a family\u2019s financials. When I applied I was denied because I\u2019m paper my father made too much. Yes, but that did t take into account the months he was unemployed due to the market crash and we were getting back onto our feet. \n\nSo my parents and I made a deal: I could stay at home for free so long I took care of my education. I worked 2 jobs and went to school full-time. If I could only afford a certain number of classes a semester then that\u2019s what I took. In the end I graduated a little late but I walked away without a single dollar of student loan debt to my name. \n\nMy suggestion to kids out there is look into alternatives such as vocational schools and community colleges. Also research your state schools. Many will take on your previous credits or give scholarships if you transfer in-state.",

            "Both of the colleges I attended wouldn\u2019t let me enroll each year until I filled out and submitted my FAFSA form and reported the results to them. Even though my father transferred half of his Navy GI bill for my two years of education to earn my bachelors degree. (I had gone to get my Associates at the community college level and my mother had to pay for that out of my late grandfathers estate) \nSince the eleventh grade I had been filling out FAFSA forms annually to hear the same thing that my parents (my dad was the bread winner and my mother is a homemaker or stay at home mother) had enough gross income to pay for my schooling. I rolled really lucky dice in how I got my education and how I graduated without student loans but my case is not normal. \nVery few have a dad that generously fills out paper and form to approach you on your twelfth birthday to say you have 18 months of school paid for. \nWhat\u2019s more is that they both had to emphasize on me that I needed to get scholarships if I wanted to do four years at one university as is the norm. I had been brainwashed all of high school to expect that. And I spent three years of high school filling out every scholarship application I could get my hands on. I frittered away every free weekend for scholarship essays by the time I walked the stage at high school graduation I had filled out a grand total of 642 scholarships. And had received 0 because FAFSA said I didn\u2019t need scholarships enough to have earned them. \nI got real lucky when I was born. I got real lucky that I got to spend my senior year of high school in the running start program and attend community college a year early (that\u2019s another story). I got real lucky. \nBut FAFSA is ridiculous. And is now a curse word in my household now that I am grown, with my bachelors, and married.",
            "THIS!!! my parents didn\u2019t have \u201cmoney\u201d but I wasn\u2019t offered enough loans to cover the cost of college. So I had to take out loans in their name even though I was the one paying every cent. The interest rates were so much higher and started accruing while I was in school versus after graduating like my student loans did. The stress of knowing if I couldn\u2019t pay my loans or lost a job I would ruin my parents credit or potentially have them and my little brothers home repossessed was too much stress.  Idk if this 100% is inline with the post but the whole system is fucked either way.",
            "Thank you for posting this. I was denied financial aid via the FAFSA because my parents had not filed their taxes in nine years and had no tax information to provide. They were always in financial trouble, we were always moving to avoid people they owed money to. They lived in a different state than me by my senior year (I worked full time and lived with my grandfather). I tried my entire senior year of high school to find a way around the requirement but I was told again and again that unless I could convince my parents to file their taxes, nothing could be done. I did not have the financial resources to be legally emancipated and I wouldn't have even if I did because it would implicate my parents in tax evasion and my brother and sister were both under 5 at the time. I was enrolled in a 4 year college but without access to any kind of financial aid, I had to withdraw and started at a community college on two small private scholarships I had managed to get. By the second semester, they had run out.  The community college office of financial aid told me the same thing that everyone else had: convince your parents to file taxes or we can't help you. I was already working full time at a minimum wage retail job, so that's where I stayed while I watched all the friends I had honors and AP classes with in high school go through college. \n\nTL/DR: The FAFSA had no category for self-supporting students when I graduated high school in 2000, and, as far as I can tell, they still don't.",

And then we just tax the rich proportionally more for it and access to college is no longer the issue because it\u2019s at zero cost to the individual. \n\nProblem is, I can already hear moaning of people who didn\u2019t go to college or went to a university school whining about how they pay taxes for something they don\u2019t use.",
            "There is a general idea that most families, if they could will help their kids pay for college. Whether that is accurate or not is the general thought.\n\nThere is also the concern (accurate or not) that if students could say \"my parents don't support me\" anyone with a wealthy family would claim that, even to the point of the family renting an apartment for a month or two to save hundreds of thousands in tuition. But this inevitably leads to kids who are truly not supported by their wealthy parents in the lurch.\n\nIt is very easy to stir up anger and resentment in people when people thing someone else is getting more than you or taking advantage of a system. If (insert name of billionaire you do not like)'s kids paid less for college because they claimed they were independent than someone who's parents are in an ok financial position but helps out the kids, the mob of general consensus goes for it's pitchforks. So these \"what if\" scenarios even if they're likely to be very limited number of cases will dominate the discussion because it creates an emotional responses and not a logical one... people are more likely to vote or get engaged due to emotional response than logic.\n\nIf you do want to take a logical approach... student loan forgiveness, tuition grants, etc are putting bandaids on a bigger problem. Colleges and Universities are free to increase tuition and fees as much as they need and many are raising the cost of attending by more than 10% in a single year.\n\nIt's not sexy, it's not giving you free money, it's not causing people to pick up their pitch forks, but we need to have limits on how much the cost of college can increase year over year. Otherwise if we give more grants the universities will not just say \"well good we'll keep charging what we've been charging\" they'll say \"hey we can raise tuition by the amount that grants went up and tell the students that it's not costing them any more.\" And if we forgive loans, shady places will start wink-wink-nudge-nudge to students who are taking on a huge amount of debt \"it's no big deal, at some point the government will do another round of forgiveness.\"",

It would be absurd for the government to subsidize tuition for children of wealthy families who can afford to pay for their kids' education. Thus, we focus on income-based assistance to make sure that only those who truly need it get it.\n\nThis means one demographic is left out in the cold: children of wealthy families whose families refuse to pay. But there aren't a lot of good solutions to that. If they allowed families to refuse to pay, a lot more wealthy families would simply say \"no\" because you don't get wealthy by spending money when you don't have to. You can't base it off the individual student's income because nobody has income when they're 18. And we simply don't have enough money to provide universal free education at any institution.

The \"do I look like a terrorist\" quip is dumbest thing you could say BC we have seen grandma's smuggle shit for their relatives and more white folks then middle eastern folks bring weapons or explosives. They have to treat everyone with suspicion bc that 1 \"miss\" could bring down a plane. And that 1 shampoo bottle could carry a slurry concoction of explosive you probably didn't know even existed.

They searched my car and then told me they didn't believe I was actually on vacation because I had too much stuff with me. (For two months, you tend to pack a lot of stuff.) They ended up letting me in but the whole thing was really traumatic because they kept accusing me of lying. \n\nI had a friend who tried to go to England on a business trip, and they turned her away for not having a visa, even though the government's website specifically said she didn't need a visa for that type of trip. They took away her phone so she couldn't contact anyone to tell them where she was. They kept her in custody for over 12 hours without any food, and then stuck her on a plane back to the U.S. but to a city over a thousand miles away from the one she actually lived in.

I'd see signs at the gate(s) that said  \n\n>If you \"jokingly\" saying that you will hijack the aircraft to wherever it is you're going, you will be taken seriously, detained and arrested.\"  \n\nI still remember an old classmate of mine mentioning that when she took a plane to Israel to study jewelry making under the yemenites, mentioning the fact that since she carried a special Dremel tool for work on her craft,  security inspected it and asked  what it was.  They were rather nervous about it, and then she jokingly said  \"What do you think I'm gonna do?

My lesson was that they are normal people who are not out to harm you.  So next time you go through TSA remember that they want to be treated like normal nice people that are just doing their job.

            "Your feces takes the shape of your intestines as it moves through your digestive system.\n\nEdit: Okay, so this blew the fuck up and I'm still bewildered as to why, but let me answer some questions I keep getting multiples of.\n\n* I have no idea how this pertains to animals with weird shaped poop. Each animal has a different digestive system with unique attributes.\n\n* If you have diarrhea, your feces is moving through you too quickly and doesn't have the chance to form into the shape of your intestines.\n\n* If you have hard pellets, your feces is staying in you too long, so the water in your feces is really low, which stops it from forming to one solid piece that looks like your intestines.\n\n* No, it's not an exact replica of your intestines, but it is an approximation. Each person should have their own \"normal\" poop shape that closely resembles the size and shape of intestines. Always check your poop for bizarre abnormalities! It could literally save your life.",

            "Paleontologist here! Poop is pooped shaped because of how it comes out of the intestine. In fact, we can learn a lot about ancient creature intestines by finding fossilized poop, known as coprolites. Some dinosaurs had a set up similar to ours. Others were closer to deer. Shark poo is almost perfectly spherical, but a lot of that has to do with the way the poo falls through the water before landing on the bottom. The water helps shape it some as it moves but ancient sharks also let go of their poo in one big blob to begin with.\n\nMy favorite was this weird poop we found next to a hadrosaur site. Those ones were an oblong blob, kinda like a football, but on end had a little curl shape similar to the end of soft serve ice cream. The curl meant the creature was actively pinching off the poo at the end. Aka they clinched their sphincter. In other words we found evidence that that particular dinosaur had an asshole, and not just a tube.\n\nSide story, I used to lead tours at a volunteer fossil dig site and one of the easiest ways to tell a fossil from a rock is to lick it a little bit. The fossil will stick to your tounge because of the porous nature of the old bone. A rock won't. It was hilarious every time I would get a bunch of high school kids, tell them to lick fossils. Then move on to the coprolite section and one would always try to lick it as I told them. The look onel their face was priceless. Totally safe I swear since everything is fossilized, but fun nontheless.",

            "It's probably too late not be buried but I haven't seen a good answer in this thread. Yes others are right that stool becomes poop-shaped roughly by the shape of your intestine, and you chop off the ends by the action of your external sphincter. What nobody else has said is that stool goes from being a watery goopy mess of partially-digested food to formed stool in the colon, where it sits for several hours while your body absorbs most of the water from it to make it into a solid mass. This helps your body conserve water. So if you are dehydrated, you will reabsorb more water and your stool will be harder (can lead to constipation with pellet-like stool) whereas if you are well-hydrated your stool should be softer (though not watery).",
