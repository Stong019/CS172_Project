I accidentally closed a door on my dogs tail, not hard but the startle caused him to let out a loud yelp.\n> \n> He will regain trust you in over time, but an important thing to remember for the future is that dog psychology is VERY different than human psychology. Your first reaction if you accidentally hurt a child is to immediately fawn over the child and shower him/her with affection. The child needs to cognitively recognize the accident to get over it.\n> \n> When you immediately get emotional, nurturing and reactive after an accident then you are teaching the dog through your nurturing that you are rewarding them for feeling scared. Nurturing is a reward for wanted behaviour so in the dogs mind you are telling the dog it is right to be scared and anxious about the very person or situation involved in the accident.\n>\n> The best thing to do is to check the dog for injury, then immediately move on and try to get the dog to not dwell on what happened. After the dog is calm again, give them a treat to reward them having calmed down and give them extra affection then. It is never a good idea to give affection to a dog in emotional distress (physical distress is a bit different).\n>\n> You will find the dog will move past the incident rather quickly because the dogs ancestors don't dwell on accidents. They make their intentions very known through deliberate communication and action. Dogs also live in the present. They don't dwell on past memories, their memories of what happened in the past are mostly emotional based and not event based. Eg. they smell the grounds of a dog park where they were attacked by another dog and they get an emotional surge of fear. The fear is an automatic reaction.",

I would think a dog probably doesn't even understand why it needs its nails cut so it doesn't know why you hurt it.

On my way back home i decided fuck it i might as well walk on the other side of the street. So i did then i came up to where i got bit by that dog. I then see him running and im like oh fuck not this shit again. So i ran to the nearest fence one fucking more but it was 10ft ducking high. I made ot to the top but didnt jump down cause there were fucking rottweillers on the other side. I was fucked. So i called my dad to bring his gun since i couldn't make a move with one dog that already bit my leg on one side and 2 rottweillers on the other. He came and got the dog away. At the moment i was debating whether or not to shoot the dog because it is a hazard. A rabid dog who is mad about his friend dying biting people that walk by. I didn't because i took sympathy on him for his dead friend. If not he would be a goner\n Anyways so next week came and i was going to jack in the box with my aunt and on the way we saw 2 pitbulls attacking this lady on the sode of the street and no one stopped but us. The dogs had her by the neck and the arm. Her left forearm was gashed open with meat hanging out. Behind her right arm had holes. Her neck and head were bleeding. Cops and ambulance came.

Cutting nails (if they walk enough that shouldn't be necessary), going to the vet, getting a shot,  getting checked for ticks, removing ticks, have their teeth checked etc. Some of it even hurts if done properly. If you - firmly and repeatedly - establish that they have to follow your orders and that it's for their best they'll accept it.

For example, if you step on your dog a couple times, they may be cautious about being under your feet when you walk. This does not mean that they don't trust you, or are mad at you...it simply means they have developed the instinct to avoid being hurt by avoiding your feet when you walk. \n\nWe often times humanize dogs.

            "Ugh, that's a gut wrenching feeling. Like others have said though, they won't hate you forever and are probably reacting to your micro reactions over it, or are just genuinely upset like a toddler. Keep being their bro and it'll all work out.  \n\nMe and my dog have had similar problems. He was a stray and an adult when I got him it took a while to gain his trust, but when I first did it was Total trust and commitment. He's enourmas with huge black nails that aren't totally closed, more like a toenail taco with the quick inside. He also has food allergies and possibly a thyroid problem that make his nails really brittle and prone to breakage. Where I lived previously, he walked on / dug huge holes in a lot of sand soil and I almost never had to cut his nails. Now that we are living in a part of the country that is mostly soft mud, I need to trim them often. It's like trimming bear claws, but you can crack the whole nail bed if  not careful.   \n\nHe used to be totally chill with me trimming his nails! But one day, his nails got too long, and being brittle he broke a few of them all the way up to the tip of his toe. He was limping, it was bloody, and it looked really painful. I had to go in and trim the remaining long half of the nail before he hurt himself more.  \n\nMoral is he Hated it, he now Hates having his nails trimmed, and if he sees the clippers he will hide outside. However, he doesn't hate me. We're cuddled up right now. He still trusts me with other problems and will come find me if there's something stuck in his foot or thorns caught in his face. He just hates the nails.  \n\nThe best thing I've done to normalize the situation when I trim his nails. I make a big deal about it not being a big deal. Treats, no coddling noises, don't let any of my anxiety about cutting a quick show. Just reassuring commands like \"Good boy\", \"stay\", \"wait\". If he starts to get anxious when I know is he isn't hurt, then I distract him (like petting his face and getting him amped),and I do Not let go of the foot! Keep going. End of toenails is always play time and a big payout treat to add a positive association with the experience.   \n\nHe's still nervous about nail time, but now he just lays as still as possible and waits for the end because he knows it will be a big reward. It certainly doesn't seem like he holds a grudge against me.. Maybe the clippers tho. He hates to see them even laying on a table.   \n\nEdit: Wheni say \"do not let go of the foot\", I don't mean hold it in was place and don't let the dog pull away. Don't wrestle the poor dog. I mean keep you grip on the foot with a loose arm. Don't fight their escape, but don't let go either. Let the dog kick or pull it in until they are a little more calm, and once they chill out pull the foot back to a good toenail trimming pose. Letting go of the foot if they kick just reinforces kicking as a way to get out of nail trimming, and keeping their leg trapped in a pose causes a lot of anxiety. ",

Unfortunately walking on asphalt to file the nails down naturally doesn't really work with her and her thumbclaws are obviously not affected by walking at all.

If having her nails trimmed was painful and uncomfortable, she will begin to associate the event of having her nails trimmed with pain and discomfort. Before trimming nails, sit down with some treats and handle her paws while feeding treats. Next, stroke her paws with the trimmers while feeding treats. Once she looks comfortable with this process, try trimming one nail at a time. If she seems fine with that celebrate vocally (like saying \"ohh good girl! Great job! Whos a good girl? You are!\") and pretend like the greatest thing just happened, maybe scatter some treats around the floor to create some enthusiasm. After a quick celebration, move on to the next nail. This slow succession of events can re-train your dog to trust you during this event and also teach her to enjoy it. It takes time and patience, but goes a long way if you're trying to teach this behavior for the long run. Many dogs learn to fear having their nails trimmed due to repeated painful events.

We usually take them to the vet for their checkups or shots and ask for them to trim their nails. Another one is that we don\u2019t do this too often like it\u2019s been years but we used to take them to Petco and they\u2019d wash them, groom them, whatever as well as trim their nails. I simply am afraid to cut my dogs nails especially since they consist of a wild lab that cannot stay still and a hyper border collie. \n\nThey will soon forget about it.

I\u2019ve seen my cat go to sniff stuff and get shocked, didn\u2019t seem to care as much as was just gently startled and continued like nothing happened.",
            "When my cat gets shocked by me, his next head boop is slower and more careful. Then when he doesn't get shocked he'll go back to normal. Not sure what's going on in his head though.",

I\u2019ve given her pets and accidentally shocked her nose. She responded with a raised paw and defensive look. \n\nMy guess is that they recognize it as  thing that can happen anywhere.",
            "Pro tip: keep a finger on your cats paw (the spongy part underneath) when you pet it and you won't zap your cat! My cat is very static during the winter months, and before learning this trick I always felt bad for petting her.",

            "Well, we can't ask them yet to understand what they're truly *thinking*, but the cats would likely have felt static shocks on their own from touching things the way humans do. So the cat would likely be aware that it's a feeling that they've noticed from non-humans as well.",
            "So I have a naked cat and she has this special warm macaroon looking bed that covers her up and keeps her warm but when she gets up to move around the static shock is like fireworks. She genuinely doesn\u2019t care it\u2019s the strangest thing.",
            "In the dark my cat will literally spark when I pet him. It happens in winter and there are hundreds of small sparks lighting up and crackling when I pet him. And he sits there purring his head off so I don't think they bother him.",
            "I'm pretty sure cats understand intent. If I step on their tail by accident, they can tell from my reaction and apologies that I wasn't intending to hurt them. When they get zapped they're surprised and cautious but still let me pet them.\n\nIt might be that they don't really understand, and just look at the patterns, but really, that's basically the same thing. If you usually act kind, rarely hurt them, and seem surprised when you do, they'll realize that those incidents are the exception, not the norm. If they get zapped every time, they're going to start being afraid of you, but wouldn't you do the same? Even if you know they're not doing it on purpose, you'd still avoid touching them.\n\nTone and body language are important too. They can tell when you're being aggressive, calm, playful, or upset. They have an idea of whether you've noticed them or not. I'm sure they can piece together that a lack of aggression plus not having acknowledged their presence means you weren't trying to step on them, or that a calm approach followed by surprise when the shock happens means you weren't expecting it.",

            "When my cat was way younger (about 15 years ago), we had this older model TV that would crackle when we'd turn it off. Wherever she was, she'd run to it and press her nose against the static a few times. She seemed to like it, but doesn't enjoy getting static shocks from me in winter though.",
            "Used to be an animal behavior professional. This is more than anyone probably wants to know but anywho in case anyone else has time to waste:\n\nCats (and most of our other species of pets) don't have the neurological development that supports a lot of abstract reasoning and concepts like humans and some other species are prone to. \n\nThe concept of static shock is beyond their capability to correctly understand, and they're given to what's called Superstitious Learning. They'll attribute it to something in their environment, like possibly you petting them or whatever Antecedent came right before. It can take only one time to happen, and this is called One Trial learning. The process is Aversive CounterConditioning. Simplified version, pairing a neutral/positive Stimulus (like petting) to an aversive (unpleasant) stimulus (like a shock). In this order, btw.\n\nIt can easily lead to phobias, aggression and other documented risk issues, which is why we don't tend to recommend using pain and fear inducing stimuli to train animals. At least those of us who follow research and learn the science and learning theory in our field...\n\nBut if you don't use fear and pain on your animals, they tend to be more forgiving and more resistant to developing this phobia, and are unlikely to become aversed to you petting them even if it happened before/during a shock, and tend to view it more as an outlier experience, rather than the norm. \n\nI've included some terms and please feel free to ask if any aren't adequately defined. \n\nIf your cat is becoming defensive of being pet, you can A. Try to prevent shocks in the future (humidifier helps) B. Reverse the conditioning by pairing your petting at neutral levels of exposure with high value food. Repeat until it looks like petting it's self predicts treats. This is called CounterConditioning and is a Classical Conditioning method. You've created a conditioned positive (valence = value) emotional response to petting. \n\nThis is great to use for a lot of behavior issues, btw.",

            "My cat doesn\u2019t seem to think I caused the static shock.  If I do anything that upsets my cat, like pet him too much, or pet him too little, or get up to go to the bathroom when he needs to continue sitting on my lap, he will angrily reprimand me.  But I am not punished for electrostatic shocks, so I presume he doesn\u2019t blame me for it.",
            "It's one of the things I hate about winter, the dry air makes it rather easy to build up a charge while petting my cat.  \nWhat's really annoying is sometimes that charge will dissipate into my headphones, zapping my ears and causing crackling.

She hears the zap and has a look of confusion. Put sunscreen on recently and holy cow that stuff turns a slide into a taser. I had her take off her shoes to help dissipate it that day. I grew up with a fear of slides because of the shocks. At McDonald\u2019s their slides had rivets. It\u2019s like a bunch of little tasers all the way down.

It has destroyed a couple of keeper-wolf relationships - the wolves seem to think we're magic wizards that can zap them.",
            "Most likely your cat does not understand motives of others.\n\nIf you were to purposely shock your cat when it got up on the table (don't do this), your cat most likely will not think, \"human doesn't want me on the table, so I shouldn't go on the table,\" it'll think, \"I get owies when I get up on the table, so I shouldn't go on the table.\"\n\nSame when you give them accidental pain. They just think \"ow, that hurt.\" They might connect it to your presence, like that the shock happens when they touch your hand, but they won't be concerned with whether you're doing it on purpose or not. \n\nCats and most other animals most likely don't have a concept of \"on purpose\" or \"accidental\". Things just happen or they don't. If the animal can identify a pattern in the bad things they will change their behavior to attempt to avoid it.\n\nAnd if there's no pattern to the owies - if 99% of the time your hand represents scratches and pets and comfort and only 1% of the time it randomly delivers pain - then their behavior probably won't change. It's not a severe enough pain to make them forget the positive reinforcement they get from your hand.",

It could be something like seasonal depression (winter blues are legit), situational depression (I\u2019m lookin at you COVID-19), a chemical imbalance, or the beginnings of general depression. This could also be an early symptom of autoimmune diseases like lupus, hashimoto disease, or fibromyalgia to name a few. \n\nMy best advice, other than talk to your doctor, is to push through when you can, but also allow yourself to rest when you need to.

Break it down start small. Like heck brush your teeth and brush your hair. Good job tomorrow you are going to do that and add a load of washing.  Start small build up.",
            "[deleted]",
            "Yes. And NO its not depression. \n\nNo one is super excited to go wash some dishes. Its called a chore because its tedious and not very pleasant.  If you pay attention while you're doing it its not actually complicated or physically burdensome, its not HARD its just not fun.\n\nExercise takes effort to do as well, and its rarely exciting. You might feel a little better afterwards, but mostly its just repetitive and kinda boring.\n\nNo one is thrilled to do these things. Theres nothing wrong or different with you.  \n\nBecause they're a bit tedious and not immediately rewarding your mind will look for ways to avoid them. ESPECIALLY if you're going from an instant gratification activity like reddit or gaming to chores and exercise. The activity itself isn't difficult,  convincing your mind that its worth the investment is difficult. Pay attention next time and you'll notice its not the cleaning itself that takes so much effort, its convincing your brain to start and complete the task that takes effort.\n\nThe solution is equally boring and unpleasant; do it a little and often, make it a daily habit or even more frequently, cut back on high dopamine \nactivities like reddit and gaming so your mind learns to appreciate the small rewards like a clean sink, and do the less exciting activities first with the high dopamine stuff later as a reward for completing everything. Its far easier to go from a jog to reddit than vice versa. The more you do it the more you train your brain to be ok with doing it. Self discipline takes practice.",

            "Many people here are right when they say it could be a connection to depression, but what I'm curious about is do you do these tasks just when you think of them or do you schedule them into your day?\n\nRoutines are important for mental health. I suggest you set times for yourself throughout the day that are designated \"cleaning\" or \"work out\" time. Cleaning can be a tough thing to not do in a schedule because then you dont clean until you notice it, and that certainly takes a lot more effort then tidying up 10 minutes every day. The lack of cleaning everyday leads to the time you have to clean being more intense. Try for just a week to set a few times to designated activities (Including your relaxing/hobby time!) See if it helps.",
            "I've had similar thoughts at some point, but I found that if I consider each step in my day as an intentional choice (cleaning up to make my bedroom a place I actually want to spend time in, exercise for my mental health, etc.) it doesn't feel quite so effortful.",
            "You my friend, may have depression. Seek some therapy, get outside, don\u2019t let this fester.",
            "I feel this. One thing that really helps me get through cleaning/chores is a good podcast or an audio book, or just crank some good tunes. Pair the work with something to take your mind off how tedious it is. Also make a game of it, or limit the time: do something for 15 mins and only 15 mins. Reward yourself if you pull it off. As others are saying it may also be an indicator of depression. So be aware of that. Good luck",
            "Do you feel like you have anything you\u2019re working toward in your life? Like a solid direction that you can orient yourself behind? Losing interest in the small things required in upkeeping your life usually indicates a dissatisfaction with or disconnection from your life in a \u201cbig picture\u201d way. Feeling lost in life can make even the simplest things seem to lose their meaning as well.",
            "This is fairly common. It can be a symptom of depression or ADD/ADHD or even a few other disorders. Depression zaps all your energy and enjoyment, making everything seem much harder. ADD/ADHD tend to affect your attention span and can cause a task to be very overwhelming.\n\nMany people are experiencing or just starting to notice a decline in their mental health what with the prolonged social distancing and life in general just not being \"normal\" anymore. It's suprising how having your regular schedual you had for a while suddenly thrown off, plus all the extra rules that have to be memorized. Not being able to see most of your friends/family regularly, or even losing people you know in this time (and any other time, for that matter) also can have this effect.\n\nPersonally, I lost my dad at age 14. He was 54. It felt like he was taken away far too early. I'm 25 now, and that grief has resurfaced like an old wound that was almost healed then reopened. I was in a bad depression for nearly a decade, and now I'm showing signs of ADD/ADHD/PTSD. Specifically with how my mother just did not find anyway for her to replace the support my dad had for me (she's a narcisist, and tried to keep me down by convincing me I was stupid and only buying EXTREMELY unhealthy foods, most of which I now am finding I'm allergic to). I had nightmares about losing my sister and, consiquently having no one to turn to when mom went on a rampage or got mean.\n\nI suggest trying therapy. It might help. Until then, try breaking down a task to the most basic steps. Instead of \"I must do all the dishes\" break it down to \"I must wash one dish\" and then keep doing that. Similar to the method of \"I can do anything for 10 seconds\" and then just keep it going by breaking it down to 10 second intervals. \"I have to vacuum this room\" no, you have to vacuum this section of floor, then the next, and so on. This is how I break down tasks or they just seem too overwhelming and it's hard for me to focus on them.",

            "40 hour work week really doesnt leave you much energy for much. I wouldnt say things like cleaning up or exercising is minor. it definitely takes a lot of mental energy, especially when you have to do it almost daily. I think about it like this. Before, people had more labor jobs than now, so those people didn't have to think about extra exercise as much as we do. It also used to (in the US at least) be that 1 person working is able to support a family. This way, housework can be done mostly by the person (and kids) that  doesnt work, which reduces housework load for the full time job person. Now people work full time sometimes over time or multiple jobs. Those things get you exhausted more than you know.",

            "Not exactly what you're talking about, but here's my two cents. \n\nLife is effort. Every living thing is constantly doing, striving, trying. A plant pushes towards the sun, pushes energy into its fruit, and then dies. An animal searches for food for energy, searches for a mate to reproduce, fights or runs to escape death and survive. A human spends effort on similar things - eating to live, sleeping to live, cleaning to make things nicer so that they feel better, searching for companionship, knowledge, learning.\n\nDeath is the cessation of effort. Life is putting effort or energy into things. Sometimes that sucks and it feels hard. But it is living. When you put effort into things, even little things like brushing your teeth or showering, you are living. I think that using this perspective can help one to find meaning in things that might seem mundane.",

That being said, 2020 and the desperation and the loneliness successfully wielded me down to nothing and on the backend of the year and the beginning of this one I s e r i o i s l y (more than ever in my life) got my shit together because of the love, compassion and motivation from my friends (I also started online therapy which is much slower than I expected but well worth it).

This must be criminally negligent manslaughter and he should be held responsible.",
            "No I don't feel bad for him. He was handed a firearm with a live round in it. Why didn't he check the firearm? Why would you trust someone like this with a firearm and blanks? There's no excuse to not check a firearm that's been given to you. Even if it's the 987th time you've been handed a gun with blanks and every single one has been properly loaded. You check the gun every single time.",

Called his daughter a 'pig', went along with (and defended) his wifes totally fake hispanic persona, homphobic, delayed a plane for refusing to stop playing 'words with friends', assaulted a paparazzi, oh and road rage over a parking spot. He's the poster child for spoiled, entitled arriviste, who thinks people should care about his words and not actions. Anti gun too, so how ironic that he would point a weapon at anyone. Even on  movie sets, you don't aim at someone, you aim off to the side. The cameras are set so you cant see they aren't actually aiming at a person.",
            "A lot of these comments are missing a big point.  I feel terrible for Alec and wouldn't wish that on anyone,  and this is a terrible accident that is regrettable, BUT if you're handling a firearm it is absolutely your responsibility to know whether it's loaded or not and act accordingly. There is no excuse, you never \"take someone's word for it\". Checking it yourself is the only way to know or awful terrible things can happen. There is a personal accountability mindset that you need to apply to gun handling 100% of the time. The man is a career actor who's been doing this for decades and there was accidentally discharges on the set previously.  You have to be more careful, period.  I wish him the best and feel for the families of the victims, this was completely avoidable.",

            "I honestly dont feel bad for him, as he's not faultless in this. If he or the AD that handed him the firearm had recieved proper firearms safety training this wouldn't have happened. One of the very important rules of firearm safety is when you're given a weapon you check if its loaded and if a round is chambered, or when you pick up your own weapon that has left your sight. You never know who could've tampered with it. If the firearm is in your possession, it's your responsibility. \n\nFor example, lets say you run a red light and hit and kill a pedestrian, only you thought the light was green because your buddy in the passenger seat said it was and you didn't bother to double check. So are you faultless because you thought the light was green? No. You're the one controlling where that 4000 pound bullet is going, doesn't matter what your buddy in the passenger seat said, it's YOUR responsibility to operate it safely. \n\nThis incident was completely avoidable, if there was proper firearm safety being used here this wouldn't have happened.",

            "Treat a gun as if it\u2019s loaded until you can verify that it\u2019s not loaded. I fell bad for the victims.",
            "Not really \n\nHe's a pompous asshole and they fired all the union workers on set after they complained about safety violations and poor treatment. He was the producer of the film so I'm sure he had a lot of power over how set was run.\n\nI'm really just sad that it was someone else who had to pay for his arrogance. However firing the people who care about safety and then replacing them with no union guys who don't care about safety pretty much spells someone getting killed on the job. \n\nSo no I think he actually deserves prison or at the very least to bleed all his money.",
            "He killed someone due to negligence. A blank gun can kill someone if you\u2019re reckless with it, anything obstructing the barrel of the blank gun becomes a projectile when fired. It is an unfortunate accident however he deserves whatever legal repercussions that result from this.",

Yes, I do feel bad for him, but at the same time he was one of the films producers, and most likely the most powerful person on the set.

            "First off I'm sorry for your loss, and you are a real life Hero. My advice is to look for any \"mom and baby\" groups in your area. It doesn't matter that you are a single dad, you will be welcome to join. I would start with community centres, gyms/yoga studios or even Churches if that's your thing. Being around other people with babies will help you and your daughter. She needs to be socialized and you need to be around people who understand what you are going through. Having a group of people you can talk to about baby things will be a huge help. Good luck!!",
            "You are the example that she will decide her partner upon. \n\nThe respect and love you show your daughter is the guide she will live with. Take that responsibility seriously.  Teach her to love herself, teach her to be strong(take her outdoors to learn fishing and camping), teach her to be kind and show compassion, teach her what it means to be a good and strong person. \n\nShow her your own humility and that when you recognize an area you need to improve,  you don't proudly ignore it to think you're just a better person.  \n\nEducate yourself and your daughter about healthy and toxic relationships,  it's really important she understands the difference. \n\nMy father demonstrated that I didn't deserve respect or love without being fully compliant. They taught me that they did things \"for my best interest\" when my abuser demonstrated those same things....I fell into a terrible hell of a trap.  Please don't let the same happen to your daughter.  I no longer speak to my parents because in all the time, all the loss, they are too proud to work on, or even see the issues. \n\nCheck out the 5 love languages of kids.  It's pretty helpful. \nThat's my 2 cents\n\nEdit: \nI didn't think this was one of the questions with additional context, please pardon if I was too.... fierce.\n\nHer parents are examples as well,  even though the tragedy happened, he was your best friend, make sure she knows about them.  Tell her stories when she's old enough.  Even though it's a hard thing, she deserves any memories about them you could share.  \n\nThis is a pretty difficult way to become a single father. Keep in mind,  they wouldn't have picked you as a legal godfather if they didn't believe in you, remember that as well. They believe you have this, know that you do.   You're already getting the right idea by reaching out for help.  Id she's that young, it would be a Very good idea for you to take a few parenting classes,  especially infant CPR.

It means a clear set of rules and consequences. We all do better when we know what is expected from us. Take time for her. You video game of whatever you do for fun can wait. She will be growing and changing so fast that if you blink you miss stuff. You will have time by and by to pick up your hobbies again when she has hobbies of her own.\n\nNever be afraid to apologize. Kids will copy your behavior and in that way, if you let them, they can make you a better you. You want your child to be compassionate? Then you have to show them compassion. Teach her anger is ok, just how to channel it peoperly. Teach her to love. You can do this. Most of us parent are flying by the seat of our pants so you are in good company.",

I mean you should have people around you that may be able to help.\n\nYour family and friends, her family and friends. They can offer advice and help, should you ask. Just like you are doing right now, just with people your actually know. Remember, you are an awesome person, or you would not have gotten the job.\n\nThere may also be professional help you can get. Reach out to any organization that offers to help expecting couples, I would fully expect them to be glad to help you. The daycare at my school, for example, has (from what I can tell) at least a dozen ladies running around that would gladly explain things diapers or swaddling if you run into issues.\n\nLastly, if my neighbour, who I have never spoken to, had this issues, all he would have to do to get my help is ask. I would be afraid to offer out of the blue, but I would definitely be willing to help. So don't be afraid to ask.\n\nBest of luck with your daughter.",

But sometimes he makes comments that even as an adult make me doubt myself.\n\nI met him yesterday and I was wearing my favourite yellow beanie. As soon as he saw me, he said \"what the hell do you think you look like in that hat?\" Now I know he was just teasing, but as soon as he said that I went from feeling cute to stupid, and wanted to go home.\n\nHe's made a lot of similar comments over the years. Being a girl, I experimented with make up, fashion, hair styles, etc. And there was always a joke made about it. \"Why are you so dressed up?\" if I wore a dress or a blouse, or \"who are you all tarted up for?\" if I decided to wear heavier make-up. \n\nHe was never strict, he never told me \"you're not going out wearing that\", but he made me feel stupid for trying out new things.\n\nI'd also say, try not to put your insecurities on her. My dad always hated being center of attention, never danced at weddings because \"dancing is embarrassing and you look stupid\", he's just a shy bloke which is fine, and he was always honest and not worried about being \"manly\", but I feel like I absorbed a lot of those insecurities.",

And when I was a teenager he mostly backed off, but he also let me know that if in a jam to just call him no matter what if I needed an out. I made sure to tell my little sister the same when she went off to college bc my dad ultimately remarried and his wife is a pow.\n\nEdited: don't worry so much about breast milk, formula has come along way and in my case I much preferred the bottle to a nipple as a baby.",

It can also help explain fussy periods like the sleep regression most will go through around 4 months. It was a godsend for us. Also, read to her. Read to her every day and any time she asks (if you can). The more you read to her the more her language skills will develop.  She's never too young to start and your local library can be a great resource - some even do free baby or kids story time. It can also be a great bonding experience and can form part of a bedtime routine. Babies and children thrive on routine :)\n\nI was once told kds won't let themselves starve - so look at their nutrition over a couple days, not just 24 hours. Some days they'll eat everything and others they'll barely touch dinner so don't make mealtimes a battle.

It'll give her a sense of ownership and pride that she created this with you. \n\nTeach her how to change a tire and the different types of screwdrivers, but also be prepared to play tea-parties if that's what she wants.\n\nLastly bad parents never worry about being bad parents, so I'm sure you're going to be ok.

            "some dads feel awkward, grossed out, or uncomfortable when it comes to things like periods or sexual education as their girls grow up. thoroughly research these things. get to know the topics; become comfortable with them. practice explaining topics like these. you have to be her father AND her mother. one day you\u2019ll have to show her how to properly use a pad and how to shave her legs. she\u2019ll respect and appreciate that you were willing to talk about those things and she\u2019ll feel less alone and overwhelmed when something happens. i am the youngest child in my family. i\u2019m 20 years old, and even now my father approaches topics like those immaturely when they concern his grown daughters. \n\nshe\u2019ll have to learn about those topics eventually, and this way you can make sure that she\u2019ll learn about what she NEEDS to know, especially in states that have abstinence-only sex ed.\n\nif you have facebook, join some single fathers or parenting groups. you can get a lot of good ideas, recommendations, and tips. you can see the things that other parents are struggling with. those groups can be a very good support system. i have joined many that align with my interests, as well as some groups for army spouses at my current location. if i ever have any questions or concerns about forms, leave days, military balls, etc they can all help me navigate those issues and share their experiences.\n\nlast but not least, believe in yourself!! it\u2019s gonna be overwhelming but you got this. make sure that you\u2019re not focusing on being just a rule-making authoritarian figure. my father always supported anything i wanted to get involved in. he would help me with crafts i wanted to try and teach me things i wanted to learn more about. he respected my interests and made an effort to understand them, and understand me as an individual. i love him dearly!!\n\nedit: another topic i thought of while looking through the comments: make sure she knows that she is not your biological child. sounds weird, but it\u2019ll prevent heartache later in her life. my cousin was adopted by my aunt. my aunt raised her to know that she was not my aunt\u2019s biological child. my aunt explained to her when she was young that her father was never in the picture and that her mother had done bad things before and during her pregnancy, which was the reason why my cousin had issues with her hearing as well as why she had a little harder time learning than others. she bought her children\u2019s books about adoption. my cousin grew up very well-adjusted and with the knowledge that her parents were unable to care for her and she was given to a good home, and that sometimes life just happens that way and it was not her fault. it\u2019s never a good idea to just spring it onto her when she\u2019s a child/teen/adult. if she questions her lack of a mother or her parentage, be honest. you can simplify it as needed for her age, but never lie about the serious things. they could have drastic measures. i also advise you to keep her in the loop with her biological family\u2019s relatives if possible. you got this!",

Is it just cranky because it slept at the wrong time?\n\n# Some basic knowledge you need to have:\n\nHow to change it's diaper/ Diaper size\n\nHow to hold it\n\nHow to feed it/ What to feed it/ When to feed it\n\nHow to comfort it (This one you learn by doing)\n\nLearn cooking healthy\n\nLearn to do the Heimlich maneuver and other ways to save a life\n\n# Things that will make your life easier:\n\nIf you have the time, then try to get to know some other parents who'll most definitely help you out with everything you have to learn. (Your own parents usually suffice)\n\nTry to find a way to include your child in your daily life apart from free time\n\nThere are many books about child raising, consider reading one\n\n# Some things I wish my dad did:\n\nLet them know that it's okay to tell you everything, so when they become a teenager, they'll be able to tell you about their physical changes, without having to worry that you're the wrong person to tell about this. (Ofc for other reasons as well)  \n\nEvery human lives in phases, so don't worry too much unless the phase has a bad influence on them.\n\nAlways show interest in whatever they love or love talking about.\n\nLove your child unconditionally. If you make it look like you'll leave your child once it doesn't share your believes, don't be suprised if it leaves on it's own.\n\nThere are too many things to put in one comment but I hope this somehow helps even if it's about the diaper sizes.",

It was comforting having a group of parents (yes, it's mostly moms, but there are usually a few dads around too) from all walks of life sharing what's going on, what's normal to expect development-wise, sleep training theories,  commiserating during Wonder Weeks (seriously, look it up - predictable studied periods of time when baby is experiencing regression and fussy behavior preceding a developmental leap), etc. Saved my sanity, and I learned way more about how to get through that first year than any parenting book could tell me.\n\nIt was seriously a lifesaver to have a community I could go to, to ask the \"is this normal?\" or \"how do I handle this?\" questions to other parents who are going through the same stuff and are up with current research without constantly bugging everyone on Facebook about it, or getting outdated parenting advice from old Aunt Martha.\n\nI will admit that these boards aren't without their drama, and some boards get kind of nuts with lots of hormonal women around, but both boards I was a part of were pretty tame and it wasn't difficult to avoid the annoying stuff.",

            "First, I\u2019m terribly sorry for your loss. What a tragic way to lose your friends. The combination of this loss and new responsibility probably has you feeling all kinds of intense emotions. Parenthood is hard but incredibly rewarding, so here are my top pieces of advice:\n\n1. Patience above all else. There will be times when you will lose your mind from exhaustion or frustration, just remember that she cannot control her emotions or understand how she is making life difficult, but you can. Take a step back and take a deep breath. \n\n2. Her before you, but not to your detriment. You will of course put her needs above all else, but you cannot pour from an empty cup. Find ways to take care of yourself so you can be a better father for her. The airplane air mask is a great example, you always put the air mask on yourself before you put it on your child because you are no help to her if you are unconscious. \n\n3. She will push your buttons, especially when she is in her terrible twos. There are tons of resources that will help you navigate this tough stage of parenting. I suggest the following: Unruffled podcast by Janet Lansbury; No Drama Discipline by Daniel J. Siegel; and The Whole Brain Child by Daniel J. Siegel. \n\n4. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask for help. It seems like your mom is a wonderful source of support, so it seems like you have that covered. \n\nIt\u2019ll take some time to adjust, but the fact that you are even reaching out for advice shows that you care deeply about this new role as a father and want to do it the best you can. \n\nBest of luck to you.",

You won't know how to braid her hair (awesome videos on YouTube btw). None of that matters. You're thinking of her best interests. You'll figure out the right things to do, but you've already got the most important part down - caring. \n\nAlso, this must be an incredibly life changing experience. As a parent, it can be difficult to take time for yourself, but try to seek therapy or a support group if you can. Showing her that you can navigate this difficult experience by seeking help will help her do the same. \n\nI'm happy to send you resources on different stuff girls might like or need, but it sounds like really, you're overwhelemed and doubting yourself.

            "Wow, this is a huge step and I commend you for moving forward with it. I have two daughters currently aged 12 and 14. Below are a few things that I think I would have appreciated hearing: \n\n- you are going to make mistakes and that\u2019s okay. No one is a perfect parent. Just do the best you can it\u2019s what you have \n\n- it\u2019s okay to be selfish sometimes. It\u2019s easy to focus on the child and let go of who you are. Find a support system that allows you some time to take care of yourself too. If you don\u2019t have family and friends who are up for it maybe try a parent group and do a swap for nights out \n\n- building strong self esteem and confidence in girls is crucial. Build them up (realistically) as often as you can. Let them find things that they have passion for and encourage them to stick with it. My girls loved Taekwondo and it was amazing for their growth. I\u2019m sure other activities would do the same \n\n- I highly recommend being open and honest from a young age. It makes it exponentially easier to talk about the hard topics later on. We talk openly about drugs, smoking, sex, puberty, peer pressure and emotional needs. They feel completely comfortable discussing in a minimal judgement way. Funny enough when I don\u2019t judge them and give open opinions they value them and usually end up making the \u201cright\u201d choices. FYI the car is their favorite way to talk\n\nA lot of the above is really for future years.

I used a sleep training group & read lots of books to help me get my daughter on an age-appropriate routine that worked for both of us. This was hard work but was wonderful long-term for my sanity!

I swear I just blinked and my daughter can walk and say some words. Enjoy every stage & take as much time as you can to snuggle & play.\n\n*Every kiddo has different needs. Every parent had a different style. You will hear a lot of practical advice, but remember it is all up to you. You are the expert on your daughter.

            "Hi, I wanted to say I'm sorry for your losses. That sounds utterly heartbreaking and I can't believe in this day and age, people who drink a lot during the night are too lazy, stupid, or stubborn to call an uber/lyft/taxi/friend,etc. \n\nI was raised mainly by my father because mom was chronically ill for several years before she passed away and we both had to take care of her daily needs. Don't let anyone tell you men can't raise daughters on their own, though they tend to understandably become overprotective when it comes to their daughters dating in their teens. My dad had a hard time warming up to potential guys I brought home and he didn't really like any of them unfortunately. \n\nAs a child, I absolutely loved having an active athletic dad. As a result, I was taught how to play basketball, baseball, and soccer. I was also taught basic car mechanic maintenance work such as how to change a tire, how to check/change oil and replace the oil filter, how to replace the air filter and car battery, and how to jumpstart a vehicle. I was also taught basic carpentry work and how to take apart electronics and put it back together again. \n\nWhen it came down to girl things as I got older like hair, makeup, periods, sexual needs(masturbation quite frankly), clothing/fashion, sex, etc. I did have to resort to BFF females and their mothers sometimes to get advice for those kind of things. The most awkward thing girls have to do at a certain age is tell their parents they are menstruating and need pads/tampons so maybe beat her to the punch and when she turns 9/10/11on her birthday(depending on when she's clearly starting puberty) let her know she's growing up into a beautiful young lady and that you made a \"woman starter pack\" for her when the time comes that includes different size pads, deodorant, wipes, facial cream and moisturizer, Venus/Gillette beginner razor with a nice thick shaving cream, etc. It sounds really embarrassing for a parent to gift this to their child but I guarantee you, they'd be forever grateful instead of them going through each milestone asking you for all that stuff individually, just make a joke about it and hopefully she'll find it endearing. \n\nAnyway, that's a long ways off and I have no idea why I am giving you advice 13 years into the future.

Yours at 3 months old is still using formula and needs several diaper changes a day.  Do some tummy time for a few minutes at a time.  Engage her when she's awake.  She cries when she needs something.  Too hot?  Too cold?  Hungry? Need to burp?  Wet/dirty diaper?  Just go through a checklist.  If all else fails lay her down gently in her bed with no pillows, blankets, or stuffed animals and walk away.  Take 5 minutes.  Call someone.  Take a short break.  Baby may fall asleep from exhaustion.\n\n6 months is where the work to fun ratio really start to turn.  At 6 months solid jar food is introduced.  You can make a lot yourself if you have the time.  At 6 months start putting her to bed with a monitor.  She should be laughing and smiling.\n\nAt this point you'll have a routine down and its a just a day to day and you'll adjust as needed based on your instincts.  I'm not an expert, just a dad trying to make it too.  You'll be fine.  You already sound dedicated.  All the best to you and your new family.",

            "My dad's got a lot of experience on raising children and teaching children, and I grew up hearing a lot about what he learnt, so here's what I remember of it :\n\n\\- listen to your child. They will tell you many of their stories of what they did during the day and yeah, that doesnt seem important, but it's important to them! Those small moments they tell you are *their whole life*. They're showing you what they learnt cause they are excited over it and want you to be excited. Don't belittle those moments and show your child that you care. This is also important for school moments too! Being as enthusiastic as your child at their learning encourages them.\n\n\\- About the belittling: when they ask questions, answer them as honestly as you can. Explain what you know of the topic, don't be condescending. Basically imagine yourself as the wise sensei showing your apprentice the ways of the world.\n\n\\- Make them understand the concept of \"No\" early on. I know personally that my aunts and uncles would give my cousins what they wanted until they were 4 as though it's at the age of 4 that they'll miraculously understand. DO NOT DO THAT. The human mind learns on experience and consequences. Yes they will cry at first when you dont give them candy - but trust me they will cry a LOT longer when you dont give them candy after they have learnt that if they cry long enough or hit you hard enough they'll get it. (Watch spoiled children - the crying is an act, trust me, actual crying doesnt get switched off that quickly. Dont teach them to behave that way to get what they want) Make it clear that no is no and life is like that. It helps both you as a parent and teaches the child how consent works.\n\n\\- Keep their life disciplined (????? sketchy memory here) . I grew up under a military dictatorship compared to some of my friends, ngl - my parents kind of exagerated that bit and i dont suggest you go that hard. But like the last point, children will learn about discipline at ONE point or another. The earlier, the better. Turning up at 14 with chores they never had to do is a bad idea for the child in question. Why would they have to do it now? Slow steps, like bed time at strict times, and chores escalating slowly as they grow helps with their responsibility. Again, refer to the previous jot note - the concept of No is important.\n\n\\- DONT HIT YOUR CHILD. Disciplining your child DOES NOT NEED pain and fear. Teach them they will get consequences they won't like - like staying in the corner or no games or smthn. BUT PLEASE DONT USE PAIN - that fear continues on till adulthood.\n\n\\- LOVE YOUR CHILD. This is said before.\n\nAlso my dad would always say that \"everything happens before the age of 4\". Love them a lot at that time. \\_talk to them\\_, hold them, teach them, laugh with them, make them happy, teach them no. There's a book by the same name \"Tout se passe avant 4 ans\" written by a doctor in idk what, and my dad based a lot of what he knows on that book (translated from american idk the original name). Good read - focuses on discipline and giving a LOT of attention to your child.\n\nI hope this helps! Everyone here has got some great advice, i hope this is the same.\n\nGood luck and say hi to your god daughter for me!\n\n\\-Ebrikedebri",

            "The biggest thing you can do as a parent to make sure that your child is not a nightmare- when you say \"no,\" you HAVE to mean \"no.\" Never, ever go back as a result of them asking over and over and over or whining or crying to just shut them up. Don't say \"no\" to everything as a reaction- carefully consider the question before you answer. If you ever show weakness, you can never expect them to accept \"no\" for an answer.\n\nAlso, I like this quote:\n\u201cListen earnestly to anything [your children] want to tell you, no matter what.

            "I'm going to start this with the disclaimer that I'm not, and never will be, a parent. I'm speaking as a person who was recently a teenage girl, though.   \nMy advice is to be a safe place. Don't be extra harsh, don't be the parent that your child will be scared to go to because you're going to punish them for anything even remotely out of line, don't rule through fear. Lead by example, or guide through loving discussions, and if you can, explain why a rule is in place, rather than being a \"because I said so\" parent. Avoid hitting your kid, spankings included. They'll be scared of you and won't come to you for help.   \nBe the parent that your kids want to go to for help. Be accepting, be open, and be honest. Be willing to admit when you don't know something and show your kid how to find the answers.   \n\n\nJust, be the parent you would have wanted for yourself.

Survivors guilt can be pretty aggressive sometimes (it\u2019s had a hold of my dad for 53 years) so it\u2019s good to get on top of it before it gets out of control.\n\nDon\u2019t be over protective because you\u2019re all she\u2019s got you want to keep the lines of communication open even when you may not agree with each other.\n\nTeach her that no matter what the world may tell she is beautiful and being herself is enough.\n\n It\u2019s good of you to take this on while you yourself are grieving.

            "Hi. Sorry for your lost. But congrats on the baby. It's hard to raise a baby these days and its expensive these days. I have an 8mo baby boy and two older kids (18 and 16). So here are some advice that hopefully isnt already mentioned. These are based off of observations and best practices i do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Dont spoil the kid. It's a baby so it doesnt need a great deal of things. Spoiling isnt really healthy for kids anyways. You'll find that its not easy to not get them what they want if they start to cry. But keep to your cool and speak to them (when they've become toddlers that is) why they can't have something. \n2. Raising a baby can be expensive but you can do it in a more frugal way. Instead of buying new clothes, look for hand me downs from friends and family and buy from thrift stores. instead of paying $10 you could be paying $2 for a onesie and between $5-10 for coats and jackets/coveralls. Babies dont wear clothes just like adults. They can sometimes only wear a piece of clothing for upto 10 times and its time to move on to a bigger set. \n3. Buying formula can be expensive. I find it cheaper to get it online. If you want to feed the baby breast milk, there are movements out there that provide breast milk to parents that can provide them to their newborn. Breast milk is much better for the baby but if its not accessible then resort to formula.\n4. Eventually they'll outgrow their stroller. Strollers used to cost much less when i had my first one 18 years ago. So the most cost effective way to get one is to do research online. Youtube is really helpful because we got to see what they actually look like and how its put together. You dont have to drive around looking at every store. \n5. Obviously youll need diapers. I go to costco because its a no-brainer to buy in bulk anyways. Don't get the licensed character ones because they cost more and youll get less. I get the kirkland brand (costco brand).\n6. Once the baby is big enough to handle solid food, dont get the all in one baby food makers. They sort of work - but they dont really. They also cost a lot more. What we do is we use a blender and an add-on to our soup pan to steam veggies. If you need containers, use mason jars (glass). Ball sells smaller ones with lids. Watch some youtube videos on best practices.\n7. Take it easy. I cant say this enough because some parents can get overwhelmed when their baby starts crying. Take baby classes if necessary. Watch videos on youtube on how to care for a baby. They have tons of books on best practices also. Do what it takes. You have to understand that your baby cant speak - so it gets attention by crying. Crying could mean anything. It could mean a change of diaper is necessary, its not comfortable, its hot/cold, its sleepy, or its hungry. Check all the boxes or better yet, have a printed checklist so its already there to remind you. Youre obviously going to lose some sleep so when your baby is asleep, you sleep or rest too.\n8. Avoid being on your phone while youre around the baby/kid. Its bad practice. When the baby is around 6 months thats when they start to pay attention more. They'll be even more curious as the months go by so every little thing will get their attention. Even that squeak on the floor boards gets my baby excited sometimes (he looks down and wonders where that sound comes from).\n9. Lastly, be careful with taking the kid out these days because of the anti vaccine movement. Not all kids these days are vaccinated and that can be dangerous to your baby since she doesnt have all the vaccines to protect her. You can find out if theres an outbreak in your area or the county youre in online. \n\nI hope this helps. It breaks my heart that your friends passed but im hoping youre ready to care for this child no matter what. Please take care and if you need to speak to someone just DM me through here. Im always happy to help new parents. Take care - J",

He always listened to my side during an argument. He always hugged me and told me he loved me more than anything in the world. When I was seven i gave him a shirt that said \"super hero\" and mine said \"sidekick\" and he cried. We learned how to cook more or less together (lots of pizza growing up though, and it ended up becoming a tradition to have pizza once a week). We learned about periods and came up with a solution for the tampons vs pads debacle together. He learned how to brush and style my hair, so I wasnt the disheveled girl no one wanted to play with. He taught me how to read, introduced me to his favorite bands, took me to parks, showed me how to use chopsticks. Helped with homework and taught me how to be independent by doing it myself. He took me to make-up stores and listened and tried to really understand what the lady tried to teach us so that he knew what to buy and when to buy and how to give me advice. He took me bra shopping lol. I honestly remember my childhood very fondly. There were issues (me crying all the time when i was little because i missed my mom and couldnt understand why she didnt want me, having to go to school earlier and be the last one to be picked up because he had to work longer hours to make money to support both of us, him being tired but still always playing with me, having to stay with grandparents on weekends because dad had to work, etc) but i think it was all good. He always kissed me goodnight. He never forgot my birthday. He would always pack me a school lunch.\n\nI think the only thing you can do is love her, never let her doubt you love her. Tell her everyday. Tell her you have her back. Let her know youre there for everything, no matter how uncomfortable it may make you feel. Just the fact youre asking already tells me you care a lot. My dad says we are partners in crime. Theres nothing I dont trust him with.\n\nI can tell you I had the best dad in the entire world. No one will ever be as great as my dad is, as far as I care.

Better that than yelling or shaking. \n\nBtw crying usually involves these things. Hungry, diaper, scared (so comfort), hurt (like a piece of clothing pinching) or hot. So sometimes if she is just crying nonstop I would undress her to the diaper and make sure she isn\u2019t just over warm or clothing issue. \n\nAnd it will be hard but I swear to you as she grows up she is going to amaze you.

I never wanted kids but it\u2019s something that adds meaning to my life now. My daughter\u2019s giggle and how she lights up when she sees me arrive to pick her up or when she hugs me while we play is a tangible benefit. It comes  with a feeling that is a reward that I never dreamed I would ever care for or want (mostly because of severe abuse I experienced throughout my childhood). I was worried that I would involuntarily become like the monsters that abused me. I never had a strong desire for children and struggled with my past and ran away after she was born and was planning to spare them and the world what I assumed I would do.  My wife is a saint and understood my fears and convinced me out of the dark hole that I thought I deserved.\nMy wife and I would take turns during the ~3-10 nightly feedings. The first year is so difficult because there is little human emotional response. But  there is definitely some evolutionary mechanism that has triggered a change in how I asses value in my life.  I love my daughter so much in spite of how difficult my life has become. My wife and I raise our almost two year old girl together and can barely do it even with some babysitting help from her grandmother on the weekends. The cost is astounding on so many levels.  I couldn\u2019t imagine doing it alone and despite arguments to the contrary developing kids require and receive different benefit from mothers and fathers. A strong male figure is hugely important for both girls and boys. But so is a strong female figure. If you can find a person that will accept the role for the infants sake (not suggesting you find someone for you I\u2019m speaking for only the need of the child and suggesting it may be filled in complete divorce from your personal love life). If a god mother could help with being a role model in the infants life it would make your life a tiny bit easier. My wife takes two days a week to watch our daughter and i take one. She\u2019s pretty successful in her field and I\u2019m about to finish my masters in a technical field and transitioning into industry in the second act of my career choices. We make 100k together and still struggle financially with the costs. I know there are subsidies available to help especially for people making less than that. I don\u2019t say this to frighten or dissuade you but to communicate the reality of the situation. \nYou are an absolute saint for agreeing to this task which will truly test you. maybe this will come easy to you my experiences are unique to myself but without my wife I don\u2019t know how I could survive this and without her mother taking her one night a week so we can sleep we\u2019d both probably kill each other. \nIt takes a village. My daughter has many people who love her and that she loves. Her daycare provider loves her and my daughter loves her back. The choice to go to a family run daycare was made out of financial necessity but that we now choose to continue with despite a 1.5 hour long commute that takes me one hour beyond where I work because of the emotional benefit to my daughter. It takes the love of many people. Im sure I\u2019ll mess up in different ways than those I\u2019m so worried about (my wife and I agree that smacking or hitting or ant punitive violence is not  tolerable and will result in death for the administrator  if my daughter experiences it). I don\u2019t know if im doing it right but I hope so good luck you\u2019ll succeed because you have the emotional requirements that lead to choices that benefit children at a cost to the parent, unimaginable and illogical love for them.",

I know that might sound weird but the best parent is one that loves themself and then passes that to their child. If you start to resent your child, even secretly, she will eventually sense it.",

Everyone will learn all the tips and tricks day by day. Your time with her is more valuable than anything else. Just spend it with joy because you got her and you will be best things she has. Everybody fails if you want to think of mistakes like that. But after all they will be only minor little mistakes you will learn from. Its hard to be father, mother, aunt and uncle at the same time. And at the same time thats awsome feeling too. Just never give up. Talk with people and talk with her. Now you have the most purest love in your life allways remember that.\n\nBest advice i can give as a young man raising a daughter is. Talk with her even when shes so young. And when time goes on and she grows teach her about feelings and how to express them. Talk with her about meanings of things. And when you'll see that you will never give up and nothing, not one thing, is too big thing to overcome. Teach her that.\n\nEverything else comes as you go.

        "selftext": "This is not potstirring or political or time for a rant. Please. My child is a real person, and I'm a real mom, and I need perspective. \n\nI have been a tomboy/low maintenance woman most of my life. My first child was born a girl. From the beginning, she was super into fashion and makeup. When she was three, her babysitter took her to get nails and hair extensions, and she loved it. She grew into watching makeup and fashion boys, and has always been ahead of the curve. \n\nNot going to lie, it's been hard for me. I've struggled to see that level of interest in outward appearance as anything but shallow. But I've tried to support her with certain boundaries, which she's always pushed. For example, she had a meltdown at 12yo because I wouldn't buy her an $80 6-color eyeshadow palette. But I've held my nose and tried. \n\nYou might notice up until now, I've referred to her as \"she/her.\" That's speaking to how it was then, not misgendering. About two years ago, they went through a series of \"coming outs.\" First lesbian, then bi, then pan, then male, then non-binary, then female, now male again. I'm sure I missed a few, but it's been a roller coaster. They tasted the whole rainbow. Through all of this, they have also been dealing with serious issues like eating disorders, self harm, abuse recovery, compulsive lying, etc.\n\nEach time they came out, it was this big deal. They were shaky and afraid, because I'm religious and they expected a big blowup. But while I'm religious, I apply my religion to myself not to others. I've taught them what I believe, but made space for them to disagree. I think they were disappointed it wasn't more dramatic, which is why the coming outs kept coming. \n\nNow, they are comfortable with any pronouns. Most days they go by she/her, while identifying as a boy. (But never a man.) Sometimes, she/her offends them. I've defaulted to they as the least likely to cause drama, but I don't think they like my overall neutrality with the whole process. \n\nBut here is the crux of my question. As someone who has never subscribed to gender norms, what does it when mean to identify as a gender? I've never felt \"male\" or \"female.\" I've asked them to explain why they feel like a boy, how that feels different than feeling like a girl or a woman,  and they can't explain it. I don't want to distress them by continuing to ask, so I came here. \n\nHonestly, the whole gender identity thing completely baffles me. I don't see any meaning in gender besides as a descriptor of biological differences. I've done a ton of online research and never found anything that makes a lick of sense to me. \n\nAny insight?\n\nEdit: wow. I wasn't expecting such an outpouring of support. Thank you to everyone who opened up your heart and was vulnerable to a stranger on the internet. I hope you know you deserve to be cared about. \n\nThank you to everyone who sent me resources and advice. It's going to take me weeks to get through everything and think about everything, and I hope I'm a better person in the other side. \n\nI'm so humbled by so many of the responses. LGBTQ+ and religious perspectives alike were almost all unified on one thing: people deserve love, patience, respect, and space to not understand everything the right way right now. My heart has been touched in ways that had nothing to do with this post, and were sorely needed. Thank you all. I wish I could respond to everyone. Every single one of you deserve to be seen. I will read through everything, even if it takes me days. Thank you. A million times thank you.\n\nFor the rest of you... ... ... and that's all I'm going to say. \n\nFinally, a lot of you have made some serious assumptions, some to concern and some to judgmentalism. My child is in therapy, and has been since they were 8 years old. Their father is abusive, and I have fought a long, hard battle to help them through and out of that. They are now estranged from him for about four years. The worst 4 years of my life. There's been a lot of suffering and work. Reddit wasn't exactly my first order of business, but this topic is one so polarizing where I live I couldn't hope to get the kind of perspective I needed offline. So you can relax. They are getting professional help as much as I know how to do. I'm involved in their media consumption and always have been on my end, though I had no way to limit it at their dad's, and much of the damage is done. Hopefully that helps you sleep well.",

It looks like on top of struggling with their identity (In a world that is constantly telling teens what they should be or how they should identify) they are also going through some pretty serious self hatred and are feeling very untethered.   \n\n\nMake sure that while you're being supportive, you're also maintaining boundaries and structure.  Kids LIKE boundaries and structure, even if they don't know it.  Out of bed at the same time, back in bed at the same time, eating regularly, homework done on time, some sort of physical activity every day.  \n\n\nThey will hate you for it now, but they'll thank you for it later.

            "The eating disorders and self-harm are the first worrying things to me. Your child doesn\u2019t seem to feel right in their own body. Like many others suggested, therapy and/or a psychologist are the way to go, there should be no expectation that you should tackle this on your own",
            "Definitely therapy. \n\nAn anecdote for you: \n\nI have a friend with 2 kids. The oldest came out as trans and it felt right for them. There was no drama, no constantly changing pronouns, no self harm. That kid simply announced their transition and went for it. That kid seems well adjusted, happy and is working toward a college degree and doing very well  in their peer group.\n\nThe younger child is still in HS, and has done things the way your kid is doing them. There has been a lot of self-harm, a lot of acting out both before and after coming out as trans, and a lot of problems with peers. This child's transitioning seems off to all the adults around them.  We just all sense that this child has something else happening and it's far beyond what their sibling experienced. It seems possible that this one could potentially decide to de-transition in adulthood. We do not know, and everyone around them is just trying to give them safe space.\n\nTherapy is helping the younger one. Changing schools helped too, because this child had a history of melt downs in public spaces that was hard to get past at the old school. The self-harm got to the place where this child was hospitalized for a while. This is definitely the stuff you seek qualified help for. \n\nThis child has learned a lot from therapy, and now participates on their own initiative. They are learning how to cope and how to behave in ways that don't get them shunned by peers anymore.",
            "I want to commend you for trying so hard to understand what your child is going through, bewildering as it is.  You are courageously exploring unknown territory in an attempt to understand, something your child may not be old enough to appreciate.  I hope they will some day.\n\nI think your role is to be both the safe harbour that your child can return to, someone who will accept them no matter what, while also being alert to any real dangers like depression or self harm. You are best able to decide whether your child needs therapy or whether they can navigate these changes without it.\n\nThen there is you.  Parenting can sometimes be a thankless job, and people do get judgmental.  Do you have a support system for this turbulent time?  Other parents going through similar things perhaps?  Look after yourself.",
            "Parent of a trans child here. \n\nYour child needs therapy.  Not because they're crazy or something is wrong that needs fixing, but because they are going through something that they need to talk through and they don't know how.  A professional will help them work through it.  My child transitioned and therapy helped him solidify his identity.  On the other hand a friend of mine had a child who came out as trans but after a year of therapy realized she wasn't trans, it was another issue they were working through that just manifested in a way they didn't understand.  Whatever your child is going through, a therapist will help them get it sorted.",

Maybe continue to hold space for their exploration but concentrate on making sure the fundamentals of development are there. Those would also be fair points of observation to discuss your expectations of their behavior: are you turning in work on time, etc.? Such factors are also profoundly influential on mental health. Beyond that maybe seek bonding time and fun activities to do together?\n\nFor the more complicated self harm stuff I would get a competent psychiatrist on board asap.\n\nWhat do you think?",
            "Its been said close to a 100 times but yea this comes down to therapy. \nAs for your own understanding of the whole thing, it\u2019s a completely valid way of thinking. There\u2019s no concrete answer, the only thing solid is that humans are very prone to needing to categorize every single thing, so when we find something cant be categorized easily it leads to general turmoil. Genders one of those things. Dont stress yourself trying to figure out the parameters of categories that are essentially for the users own self satisfaction.",
            "I'd say a psychologist is necessary. neither Reddit or parents can clear their mind if so confused",
            "As a nonbinary person.\n\nThis experience that you \"dont feel gender\" is completely normal, and that's how it is for the sweeping majority of people who aren't transgender. Most cis people don't feel gender because their percieved gender is never out of alignment with how they see themselves.\n\nA common thought experiment that cis people will try to think themselves into when it comes to being transgender is \"what if I wanted to be a boy?\", but this is wrong. If you want the closest understanding of being trans, it's \"what if noone believed I was a woman?\". What if you went on a date with someone, and he took one look at you and said \"whoa, I'm not gay\"? What if the other girls looked at you with confusion, maybe disgust, when you tried to group up with them at school?\n\nGranted these emphasize with a trans girl perspective, but as someone who's a woman, it's easiest to emphasize with someone else who's a woman.\n\nSummarizing, gender is actually a really powerful determinator of how our social life is shaped, how we are treated as people and which connections we have opportunities to make. Trans people share your view that gender is pointless, but they also have a perspective of how life-changing it is to be forced to be seen as a gender you are not.\n\nHope this helps.",
            "This sounds very similar to a young person I know. In the end, it wasn't being trans which was the issue, but rather undiagnosed autism and related anxiety. With an appropriate diagnosis, the young person was able to understand themselves a lot better, and medication alongside a talking therapy (with a specialist in autistic patients) has helped a lot in dealing with the anxiety.\n\nEdit - just for clarity, since this has got more than my usual 2 or 3 updoots: when I say it wasn't being trans which was the issue, I mean they *were* trans, it just wasn't a problem or a cause of other problems. Being autistic isn't a problem either, but being autistic and not knowing it was... stressful.",

Offer them unlimited unconditional love and support.\n\nActually, that's about it. \n\nThey probably do need a professional therapist, *not because they are wrong or broken* but because they're trying to make sense of a crap-ton of complex concepts, thoughts and emotions which haven't been historically well explored. That means it's going to be difficult, and a professional will help them with a road map for how to deal with it all without being overwhelmed.\n\nBut really, as a parent, that to-do list up there is the important one.",

            "Firstly, it sounds like you're doing a pretty good job being understanding. Trans teens are still teens and are going to try your patience with whatever they're doing.\n\n\"what does it when mean to identify as a gender?\" - ultimately this is specific to each person, but the best general description I've found is that it's what 'feels right'. Sometimes someone will refer to you as one gender or using a pronoun and it will feel jarring and alienating, whereas others will feel natural and comfortable.\n\n\"I've never felt \"male\" or \"female.\" - you might be right, but imho it's worth considering that as a cis person your gender can be such an innate part of you that it's difficult to notice how you feel about it. Trans people often have more of a friction with gender, or feel it more keenly.\n\n\"Honestly, the whole gender identity thing completely baffles me. I don't see any meaning in gender besides as a descriptor of biological differences.\" - Again just my perspective, but I think ultimately the best way to see it is as being joyful in who you are. Perhaps it's worth thinking about your early experiences of being a tomboy and how disapproving adults could be (maybe that didn't happen to you, but it's quite common). You might have struggled to explain to them why you gravitated towards being a tomboy, but it felt right to you.",

They do not understand, but they try. You try and that's a lot more than can be said about some parents. You may never understand your child, but you're doing the right thing by trying. Hopefully, they come to realize what you're doing.",
            "I am far from an expert on the subject, but I would say that even though you don't assign importance to gender differences, society at large does, including your child's peers, and that probably has a larger impact at this point. \nNot sure how old your child is, but it seems like they are struggling with who they are, and how they \"fit\" in to the world, and the best thing imo is to support them as they figure it out",
            "Hi there! Parent of a trans son here. Let's talk about gender dysphoria. You've never felt male or female because you're comfortable with what you were assigned at birth. Dressing like a tomboy isn't part of your gender - that's you recognizing that gender norms in clothing aren't really attached to who you are as a person. What your child is feeling is extreme discomfort with the gender they were assigned at birth - and that's on a deep level that cis people just cannot get without having to question their own gender first. And so they're experimenting with who they are - trying on different gender \"hats\", so to speak. And that's fine. We all do it at that age with things other than gender. Totally normal.\n\nHere are the things you need to do to support your child.\n\nFirst, trust them. They know something is wrong, and they're figuring it out. Don't ask them to explain it - they haven't figured it out yet. When they do, they'll probably have a better handle on it. When they tell you they need something for their identity, they're right.\n\nSecond, continue to recognize that the norms associated with gender aren't what gender is. My son will wear a dress to homecoming. So will the gay cis man he's taking. They just like dresses - it has nothing to do with their gender.\n\nNext, seek out trans parent support groups in your area. They'll help you find a therapist who will help your child through the process instead of trying to \"fix\" them, along with other helpful resources.\n\nFinally, keep trying to understand in places where the responsibility isn't on your child who hasn't figured themself out yet. When you misgender someone, it's because you don't really see the person as the gender they tell you they are - and that can be tough to learn in certain environments. Your child needs your support, but they also need you to see them. \n\nMy son is only 17, but I've learned a fair bit in our journey that I'm happy to share if you have other questions. Of course, you could always head over to r/asktransgender and pose your identity questions to people who have actually gone through it. You know you're coming from a position of ignorance, and that's a good place to start. The only wisdom comes in knowing that you know nothing, after all. When you're truly seeking understanding, groups who want to be understood will help you get there - just be prepared to hear things that make you question your preconceived notions.\n\nHope that was helpful. Trans lives matter, and that's your child now, too. Welcome to the fight.\n\nEDIT: The transphobes are out of the woodwork now (as they tend to do any time trans issues gain traction) so I'm gonna shut off replies. To all my trans siblings out there - you're seen and loved. Ignore the bigots hiding behind 7th grade biology; they're just scared about being left behind by a world they don't understand and want to bully into something they can.

            "The real question is how meaningful it is to apply labels to someone that hasn\u2019t fully gone through puberty. Many of the labels we use are for adults, most would find it odd to label pre-pubecent children as asexual.",
            "Your child is trying on different personas no different than trying on a new set of clothes to feel what it feels like and whether that feels right to them. You're going to have to bear with them as they go through as you call it tasting the rainbow, which I thought was cute, until they figure out and settle on who they really are. It's all part of the process. Thank you for supporting them in their journey.",
            "It sounds like your child may be struggling to determine identity. This is a normal crisis for teens, and even more so for teens today now that gender identity is so discussed. My suggestion is to have the conversation with them about how normal it is to search for a sense of identity at their age and try to relate. Discuss the option of therapy and research some lgbtq+ trained therapists together that your insurance covers. Your kiddo needs to be met with acceptance, even if you don\u2019t understand. Therapy isn\u2019t meant to \u201cfix\u201d or \u201chelp\u201d them, but to give them some new tools for exploring identity and helping them manage their relationship with food, substances, etc. This is especially important if your kiddo has endured any trauma, including adoption, divorce, etc. throughout their childhood. It sounds like they are going through a lot and therapy may be the best tool for them at this time. Perhaps you can benefit from some therapy for yourself too. I imagine you are going through quite a lot as well",
            "this isn't a trans issue or a gender issue. this is a your-child-needs-to-go-to-therapy-for-separate-problems issue.\n\nI'm going to drop this link to Professor Dave's video on transgender people\n\n[www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpGqFUStcxc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpGqFUStcxc)\n\nbecause even though it's not all relevant to your situation it explains gender and being transgender in a very concise and practical manner. *^(Though I do slightly disagree with him on his opinion of jokes made at the expense of trans people, that doesn't invalidate him as a great resource, and he also corrects himself about this anyway after people told him how seemingly harmless jokes can be extremely transphobic, but none of this is relevant aha)*\n\nbut to address some of your questions while going on as few tangents as possible for my little  ADHD-ridden brain: \n\n>I don't see any meaning in gender besides as a descriptor of biological differences. I've done a ton of online research and never found anything that makes a lick of sense to me.\n\nGender is psychological\u2014it's not necessarily connected to sex chromosomes, but it's biological nonetheless because it's a chemical phenomenon. The only difference between gender and other aspects of our identity is that it has no physical manifestation.\n\nGender is *not* a descriptor of our biological differences sex-wise, it's just a thing where your brain says \"hey, act this way\" and \"I should look like this and develop like this\" regardless of whether your body does that. around 98-99% of the time gender and sex match. The rest of the time they do not, and sometimes they can even clash violently, which results in a lot of gender dysphoria. \n\nGender identity is actually *different*. (Yes, from all of that stuff about gender and sex. Sorry.) It is how people describe their gender, but it doesn't mean that every person under the same descriptor has exactly the same gender. \n\nEssentially, trying to communicate your gender requires you to put complicated brain thoughts into simple mouth words.\n\n* For example, two hypothetical people who identify as cisgender women can feel different on the inside, but both are like \"hey, my body is female and my brain says I'm a woman\" so they are women.\n* Then take me, and some hypothetical cisgender man, who doesn't feel like he cares whether he's a man and is totally content being called a woman or using any pronouns. The only real difference then is that we present ourselves differently\u2014me being genderless because that reflects my gender (\"absolutely nothing\") and him being a cis man because he's always been a man so whatever, I'm just gonna be a man.\n\nWe simply have no way of comparing these things because gender is not a tangible thing with an objective definition.\n\n>!now some things on the transgender \"controversy\" and why people are transphobic:!<\n\n>!Sometimes people say \"why can't you just treat trans children in a way that doesn't require hormones and surgery?\" but really we can't \"cure\" dysphoria by changing their gender because that's not how medicine works and that's not how the brain works, and if we had the technology to fundamentally change someone's mind, giving that power to caretakers comes with the very heavy risk of violating minors' fundamental right to life\u2014for example parents who don't want an atheist kid can force them to undergo unwanted treatment to turn them religious, and vice versa, and etc. etc.!<\n\n>!And other people will say \"how is being trans with dysphoria and wanting surgery different from being mentally ill and wanting to cut yourself?\"!<\n\n>!and the difference is that while both dysphoria and mental illness can severely limit one's capacity to function \"normally,\" surgery and hormones fixes dysphoria at the root by making the body match the brain, while self-harm doesn't fix mental illness at the root, but provides very temporary psychological pain relief with objectively negative/harmful consequences.!<",
            "I suspect I will be down voted for this, but I mean it sincerely. You may want to look into borderline personality disorder based on the other symptoms you describe, and then take your child to a therapist who specializes in that if it sounds right to you. \n\nReddit is notorious for playing armchair psychologist, and I'm truly not trying to do that. A lot of what you described is common to BPD (history of abuse, eating disorder, self harm, desire for dramatic responses, etc.), and many therapists will give an alternative diagnosis rather than diagnosing with a personality disorder because treatment for BPD is difficult and the diagnosis can be stigmatizing. I bring it up not to be an armchair psychologist but so that you are aware that it's a possibility since professionals may neglect to tell you. Research it yourself and see if it's a path you think needs to be explored by professionals. \n\nIf your child is a minor, a personality disorder diagnosis can't be given until 18, but you can still get them into dialectical behavior therapy (DBT); time is of the essence with DBT as it gets harder to make changes as a person gets older.",

But they experienced a litany of self-destructive behaviors, as well as severe confusion regarding their identity and sexuality. Once they were officially diagnosed, however, they were prescribed mood stabilizers that seriously changed their life. They started doing better in school, stopped self harming, was able to maintain relationships better, and also came to accept themselves more as who they are. No one is qualified to diagnose based on a Reddit post but maybe look into some of the symptoms of borderline and consider that it might be an explanation for a history of erratic or destructive behavior.",

I knew multiple people in high school who were similar to your child. They came out several times as several different things, and it was a total rollercoaster for them trying to identify themselves. Now this could be rare, I don't know because I'm limited to just my experience, but I've observed that they all tended to stabilize as they grew into adulthood. Adolescents tend to struggle with self-identity, and what they experiment with to find their identity is heavily influenced by their peers and environment. The people I've known usually settled on their biological sex as they become adults, but that's not to say that's how it goes for everybody. Either way, its more than likely your child will find where they want to stay at some point.\n\nI will say, for someone who's journey has been such a rollercoaster, please don't encourage them to make any drastic decisions, as their probability of regretting it is extremely high. Like many others have said, therapy will help a bunch. Therapy is not there to 'fix' or 'correct', but rather to walk your child through their own thought processes, and understand what they're actually feeling.\n\nMy perspective comes as someone who has never struggled with my own gender identity, but I've known many peers similar to your child and I wanted to share because I thought it might be helpful.",

To them it probably often feels like you prefer using she / her pronouns BC they were assigned at birth female. \n\n\nWhat others said with therapy, that will help.\nWhat I'm recommending also is to talk with your child to work on a system. \nI know some people who have days where they prefer one pronoun over another they for example wear special bracelets. \nFor example blue for he/him, pink for she/her, yellow for they/them.

(think about the little cisgender boys being interested in make up) i went though a phase of trying to be more feminine bc that\u2019s what i saw everyone else doing and felt like i should too. obviously i don\u2019t know your kid, but definitely see some similarities between us. for me, gender is the way i am perceived and want to be perceived by the world. i still can\u2019t put my finger on it but i KNOW transitioning was the right decision for me. it has changed my life for the better in so many indescribable ways, made me completely evaluate who i am and who i want to be at a young age. i can\u2019t explain it, it just is. it\u2019s a journey for sure and it will probably continue to be difficult to understand. just remember no matter how confusing hard and scary this is for you, it\u2019s that times ten for the child. you\u2019re doing great! never forget that you are their mom, and that\u2019s very unique. your opinions and actions WILL have a major effect. but obviously you know that, wishing the best for you and your child!",
            "It is great that you are loving and accepting of your child thru all of their ins and outs. A good therapist can help them sort their feelings as they  maneuver their teen years. There is also counseling out there for parents of LGBTQ+ youth, that can help you with your understanding  and dealing with it all as well. \nGood luck and happiness to your whole family!!",

It was hard for our parents at first to wrap their heads around changing their language but just keep taking the baby steps. We have both spent a lot of time talking talking about what gender means, blah blah blah. \n\nBasically, gender now is just how we feel about ourselves, and sex is the word used to biologically describe someone/ourselves. It can feel good to hear the correct term coming out of the mouths of other people to validate that expression of self. Playing with gender identity is a good way to figure out what is right for you. For a while I used she/they and now I prefer \u201cthey\u201d. I saw someone else recommend therapy and I think that is a great idea. \n\nSomething to remember\u2026 trans ppl have existed forever. It isn\u2019t just something that happens nowadays as the media would like you to believe. The thing is that now we just have words to describe how people express themselves now. \n\nThe idea of using hormone blockers instead of hormone replacement therapy until your child is sure of what they want to do might be a good way to start out. Blockers will delay puberty, and hormone replacement therapy will change how they look.\n\nGood luck to you, I hope that you have the support you need as a parent.",

Today, they are testing out pronouns like t shirts at hot topic. So in some senses I would say this is normal, but on the other hand you talk about some other issues that may be making this whiplash even more extreme. A therapist will help parsing out normal rebellion from deeper issues.",

He\u2019s in his early twenties now and I think finally figured himself out or is coming to a close on it which is good, but we\u2019re still supportive of whatever he comes to us with! There\u2019s nothing wrong with just accepting them for who they are until they\u2019re comfortable. It\u2019s not hurting anyone.",
            "As there are a lot of questions and somewhat general acceptance of exploring what an individual\u2019s gender or sexuality is it is not surprising that some kids will go through some of these phases. \n\nImo, your best bet is to find a good, qualified and neutral childhood therapist that isn\u2019t going to push an agenda (one way or another) to help your child sort through this. \n\nIt is also good that you are being open with them and being accepting. There are also a lot of people on here bashing transgender etc. I can say from my own experience, living in a pretty open and accepting areas, being very open and inclusive in how we have explained LGBTQ+ things to our daughter as they have organically come up that she, and her friends who are similarly raised, are not experiencing what your child is. \n\nTake them at their word and make sure they have support via therapy to help them navigate. There are far too many kids committing suicide because of language thanks to the LGBTQ+ basing people, invalidating feelings that they feel are very real. \n\nGood luck to you and it will get better.",
            "Very small piece of advice -- avoid conversations with your child where you are asking questions, or saying you don't understand, or trying to get them to explain themself. In my experience, those conversations with parents feel really crap and alienating (esp. because maybe they CAN'T fully explain it). Instead, just keep going with the unconditional love part!",

            "OP, first I want to give you the fist bump of solidarity on not being a girly girl growing up, and not getting the gender thing pretty much at all. I'm in my 50s now and I have grandkids at this point.  My children have never expressed any identity issues to me, but both of them do struggle with mental illness. So from that perspective, I would like to add this in addition to what other people have already said so eloquently about the topic of gender. \n\nThe best thing you can do for your kid is to just be present on their terms. You mentioned ED and self harm issues, and I sincerely hope your kiddo is already in therapy for those. I suspect that your kiddo is struggling socially with two core issues: self identity, and membership/social acceptance. These are also things they should be addressing with their therapist. Feeling isolated and shut out by peers can be a lot more traumatic than a lot of people realize. \n\nFor you personally, since your question is about YOUR understanding, I recommend that you take your kid out to a quiet, long lunch, or maybe make a day outing of some kind, and be loving to your kid. Reassure them that you live them for the person they are, and the person they will eventually become, whoever that turns out to be. Invite them to tell you anything that they want you to know, or think that you should know, and just LISTEN.  If they don't want to open up right then, don't push, just let them know it's an open door for them. \n\nYou may never understand your kid, but you can accept them. Accept that they are a sincere, honest human being, even if they can't explain things, and/or even if you can't understand it even if they CAN explain things. I know my mother has pretty much zero understanding of what I suffered growing up having undiagnosed ADHD and that marvelous bonus of being hypersensitive to rejection that so often comes with it... but I also know that she accepts that that was my lived experience.  \n\nYour kid may or may not be trans. They will eventually figure out if they are, or if they are on a different struggle bus, and then you'll know. They ARE, however, struggling to find identity and belonging and acceptance in the world, and that's not a trivial thing. \n\nAlso, if your child is a middle schooler or older, remember that their peers can include a large number of ENORMOUS assholes, some of whom will display behaviors that are narcissistic and possibly sociopathic.  Kids can SUCK. \n\nGood luck, OP.  I know this isn't exactly what you asked for, but enough other people have addressed that better than I ever could. I hope you find something in this comment that's actually helpful to you.",

            "Not trying to start any debates, I\u2019ll be using gender neutral language to avoid any pressure.\n\nMy view on this is that all these \u201ccoming outs\u201d are part of some larger more complex mental issue. If your child is \u201cannouncing\u201d all these things trying to make definitive identifying statements, which they then go back on, that is indicative that they don\u2019t know who, or even what they are.\n\nNow, everyone is constantly relearning who they are, that is normal. The reality of \u201cwhat\u201d your child is, is where there is some controversy depending on who you ask. That topic can be left on the shelf for now.\n\nIt seems to me that this type of behavior represents two things:\n\n1: insecurity. They don\u2019t think anything in their life is concrete enough to base anything on, including their own identity.\n\n2: attention seeking. They recognize that insecurity and are trying to reach out for someone to give them something concrete, a way to define their self. They want someone to tell them who they are or at least give them a place to start.\n\nMy only recommendations are as follows: \n\nFirst, get your child a good therapist, (good being a hard term to define, use your best judgement.)\n\nSecond, avoid any permanent body altering treatments or procedures until your child is old enough to decide that for themself.",
            "I'm seeing a lot of calls for therapy here and, while that's generally a good idea, it seems to be ignoring OP's request for info about gender theory or gender studies. As someone who has been to a lot of sessions and spoken to a lot of mental health counselors, I can say with confidence that most therapists don't know a damn thing about the subject. They can always help to increase effective communication and acceptance, but providing information to really internalize a subject you're struggling with isn't the forte of therapy. \n\nSo, I'm genderqueer/nonbinary and I came out late in my life compared to a lot of trans or gender non-conforming (GNC) folks. During my time when I was living as a dude I went through periods of exploring outside of the boundaries of masculinity, but the bulk of my life was a resigned acceptance of an unchangeable fate. Breaking the code of masculinity inevitably led to alienation and a more difficult day-to-day so I toed the line -- I already had enough to struggle with, no sense adding more. I fully felt my gender role even if I didn't want to be a part of it.\n\nI feel like your kid is struggling against the boundaries of the available gender roles and seeing not only what works best for them, but which identity gets them the most true-feeling social response. While you haven't felt ascribing to one gender or another is impactful, I've personally found my role as a 'dude' comes with a lot of expectations that I don't agree with. While I am embodying that role (looking like a cis-het broguy), those expectations exist and the failure for me to perform them is a social faux pas. Expressing myself in less straight or less cis ways changes those expectations and alters how people treat me. In changing how I present myself and internalizing ideas that I'm not cis, secondary male ideas and behaviors I didn't really care about started to fall away unexpectedly. How you identify yourself absolutely matters, at least to me and others I know well.\n\nThe best way to think about what your kid's going through, in my experience, is as an experimentation with self-expression that is normal and will eventually stabilize. The only way they can judge social response is by actually embodying a role and seeing that response, and that may be why they seem to be flipping between gender and sexual orientation designators so frequently. Gender is a complex subject and they're learning about it rapidly, so those changes also represent an increasing awareness of what is possible, something incredibly healthy (IMO of course).\n\nSo, yeah, I think the why's of identifying as a particular gender matters less than their openness to exploring those avenues and indicates that they're not fully happy with what they've experimented with so far. That might change as they explore more and see that a previous identity felt more right, or it might continue to develop for a while. Either way, your response to their experimentation is a huge part of that development and it's amazing that you're not automatically shutting them down like a lot of parents would.",
            "I can relate a lot to your perspective on seeing the world without gender. And to give you some backstory - I grew up a tomboy and I generally felt like I couldn't understand femininity through most of my youth. I think I related with masculinity more closely than feminity growing up. Then as I hit my 20s I came to terms with being female and redefined what feminity was to myself, discovered femininity in my own way. It's sort of like a lifetime of coming to terms with my body instead of thinking I could be anything different. The idea of being trans was not even a fathomable idea or concept that came to me because I grew up and lived in very oppressive societies (not part of the western world), so I had to just come to terms with my gender, and as a result, at this stage of my life, I don't see myself in a gendered way at all. And I also don't see the rest of the world in that way either. But I have learned with having met and dated trans folk that some people see the world in an extremely gendered way. It's just a completely different way of seeing the world and I'm sorry it's not the perspective you asked for clarity on, but I guess what I'm trying to say is that a differing perspective than yours (or mine) is a bigger focus on how the world sees you and how you present to the world (this is coming from my experiences with people who see the world in a very gendered way, forgive me if I'm wrong). \n\nBut at the same time your kid is also a kid and there's so much that's unknown to them and they're also operating from a place that's probably not as aware or figured out. Therapy as a lot of people have suggested on here would definitely help them navigate what they're going through. But honestly I think therapy can help an entire family out if you're also willing to participate in it. I have put my mum through therapy as have I and it's elevated our whole life collectively as a family. It has especially elevated how we communicate with each other",

            "Let me hit the actual question up top. People can devote their lives to studying the nature of gender identity and someone else will still have a different experience. It\u2019s complicated. But the baseline is: how much of what makes you feel Like A Woman is triggered by your actual literal physical body and the hormones in it? How much of that is important to you? As a woman who has given birth, maybe nursed the child, etc, it could be a lot but who knows. What about the things that are social/external - hair length, feminine clothing, domestic care, \u201cemotional availability,\u201d etc - that have absolutely nothing to do with your biological abilities or limitations? Are those things important to you? Do you enjoy them? Does participating in most-to-all of the \u201cnormal\u201d trappings of \u201cfemininity\u201d make you feel good or bad overall? Does being seen as a woman make you feel good or bad overall? I say this as a straight, married, cisgender woman who often expresses themselves in a fairly masculine way but has no negative feelings about being feminine, being seen as a woman, \u201cexperiencing\u201d femininity in that way. I also have a very deep voice and get called sir on the phone constantly and have no opinions on it. I\u2019ve had people on every end of the sexuality and gender spectrum insist that I must be confused and must be trans or non-binary or *something*. Nope. Just a lady on the masculine end of the \u201cwomanhood\u201d arc.  \n\nThink of it all as a literal line with feminine at one end and masculine at the other. Everyone falls somewhere on the line. \u201cMan\u201d and \u201cwoman\u201d used to be tiny little boxes at the polar ends of that line - these very strict rules about What It Meant to be one or the other with little room for variation before you were seen as \u201cwrong\u201d or \u201csick\u201d or at least just really odd. But the boxes have grown a tonnnn over time, so there\u2019s more space for femininity in men and masculinity in women without needing to identity any other way. There always have been and always will be people who feel like they\u2019re in between the boxes, but tbh it\u2019ll probably be fewer and fewer people if the boxes for man and woman keep getting more inclusive. \n\nA lot of people are advising therapy for your child, which is absolutely correct. This rapid oscillation of identity and being totally unable to express what they feel isn\u2019t unheard of but it\u2019s not great. It can have some very real, long-term negative social and internal effects Whether your child is experiencing legitimate gender dysphoria or some other internal discomfort they can\u2019t identity so they\u2019re manifesting it that way, they need to speak with a trained neutral party for help figuring it out. \n\nHowever I\u2019d also recommend therapy for YOU. Again, regardless of what the actual root situation turns out to be, it\u2019s difficult as a parent to watch your child struggle with things they haven\u2019t experienced. It\u2019s also difficult for a lot of parents to process the feelings they have when their child transitions, even when there\u2019s not a shred of hate/transphobia/etc in the mix. It\u2019s just a complicated life change that is - while absolutely life-saving for so many people - still pretty uncommon and sometimes hard to relate to from the outside.",
            "as a trans man myself, i suggest getting your kid a gender therapist. not only can they work out any other mental health issues, but the therapist will also have information on gender stuff and might be able to help them figure it out. as the parent i think you should go with what your child is asking (with the pronouns and labels) because if they turn out to be trans, they might resent you for misgendering them (im 18 and have been out for over 5 years and i resent my mom for continuing to call me a girl). basically keep the peace and go with what your kids asking (unless they start asking for medical stuff) and get them a nice therapist, hope everything works out :)",
            ">They tasted the whole rainbow.\n\n\n> I think they were disappointed it wasn't more dramatic, which is why the coming outs kept coming.\n\n\n>Now, they are comfortable with any pronouns. Most days they go by she/her, while identifying as a boy. (But never a man.) Sometimes, she/her offends them. I've defaulted to they as the least likely to cause drama, but I don't think they like my overall neutrality with the whole process.\n\n\n>I don't see any meaning in gender besides as a descriptor of biological differences.\n\n\nYou sound like an amazing parent who is definitely not a conservative troll using conservative talking points and everything is the fault of your child.",
            "Trying hard not to be harsh here but why is your child not in therapy?",
            "I don't have any experience but it sounds to me like they're pretty confused and mixed up and aren't really sure what they feel they are which must be pretty damn hard to deal with.\n\nIn my opinion they could use some talking therapy. Not therapy to change what they feel or because they're having mental health issues but just to be able to talk to an unbiased person that may be able to offer some clarity in what they feel.\n\nYour kid is probably scared of what others will say and think of them which is why the coming out is always a big thing.\n\nLet them know that whatever they choose is fine by you and that you'll love them regardless. Make them feel they can talk to you about it at any time. (not implying you don't already op)",
            ">I don't see any meaning in gender besides as a descriptor of biological differences. \n\nYou currently view gender as sex. They mean different things, hence the different words.\n\nYou've also made the post about understanding your child's gender mostly about yourself. Family counselling might also be good on top of getting your kid some private therapy like everyone one else is suggesting.",
            "Trans woman. Other comments are right. Get your kid therapy. They aren\u2019t crazy, but having them work out their identity is a hell of a lot easier with a mental health professional. They likely feel things that are really difficult to enunciate, and so when you ask them to explain, it might be frustrating for them to try and put it into words. Not that you\u2019re wrong for asking, the fact that you want to understand shows that you love them, but if I can speak as someone who tried to figure it out on my own, it gets way easier with someone helping who is trained in dealing with gender identity issues. Giving them the space and time to figure it out and being patient really is key. Personally for me, gender is more of a vibe than a concrete feeling per se, and with friends I have who are genderfluid or demigender, I\u2019ll usually ask them what the vibe is for the day or in the moment. I know some of them have bracelets in different colors that correlate to gender, pink for feminine, blue for masculine, purple for a both, etc.. If your kid is more fluid, getting them something like that might help avoid the neutrality problem, so you\u2019ll be able to tell what pronouns they prefer at a glance, as well as reinforcing that you care and want to be supportive. You clearly do love them, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really possible to go overboard with those kinds of little signs of affection and support. Figuring out your identity can be stressful and even a little scary at times, so it\u2019s worth it to keep reminding them that you have their back.",
            "as a trans man myself, I like to think of my journey to self discovery as being like trying on clothes and trying to figure out what you feel most comfortable with. being a girl made me feel really uncomfortable, so it was like... a shirt that was way too small made of really itchy fabric. I thought for a while that maybe I was nonbinary. the fit and fabric were a bit better than trying to fit into being a girl, but it still wasn't quite right for me. then I tried seeing if maybe being a man felt comfortable. and for me, it's like the coziest most comfortable sweater that you could ever relax in. this is what's meant for me. that's how I view \"feeling like\" a certain gender. it's a matter of comfort.",
            "I\u2019m a trans masc person who behaved similarly as a child (with the makeup and girly stuff)\n\nIn hindsight, it wasn\u2019t because I felt like a girl, but because feminine things were seen as a status symbol/necessity, which can explain why he\u2019s so different now. It seems to me like he may be non-binary? Trans masculine? I wouldn\u2019t know, but there are different presentations and such for different folks \n\nAs for the constant coming out and complicated identity, I would recommend finding an open minded gender therapist to help them hopefully come to a conclusion, but only if he\u2019s alright with it because I mean, he doesn\u2019t necessarily *have* to have a concrete identity, sure. Gender and sexuality is a spectrum, and can be fluid for some. Nothing wrong with changing often.\n\nHowever when it comes to your child maybe wanting a specific form of medical transition, name change, something permanent, he needs to go to a gender therapist to help them figure out what\u2019s going on. If your child tends to change identity often, they should have a few sessions before any attempt at medical transition or name change or anything like that",
            "Aside from the gender, it sounds to me like she has something bottled up and is subconsciously trying to cause a fight to express it.\n\nI don't have kids though, so I can't speak from experience.\n\nI would definitely recommend therapy if it's an option.",
            "I'm nonbinary. \n\nSomething that you need to understand is that you'll probably never understand your kid's gender identity. They'll probably never understand yours too. Gender is strange and confusing, specially when you don't conform to the norm.\n\nRight now your kid is starting to ask themselves who they are and, trust me, it's a confusing moment. Support them, let them know other queer people, let them grow. That's all they need, respect and support. Ask them what they want and need. Be there for them, it's simpler than it seems. They learn who they are someday, but the search of their identity is theirs, and it's not something that can be accelerated or changed.\n\nAnd for your question, for me it's simply that I hate when someone refers to me as a man or a woman. I don't want people to see me as one or another. The first time I binded my chest I cried of happiness, but when I thought of people seeing me as a man I didn't like it. It's very personal, but I make a lot of conscious effort to appear androgynous and make people (even old conservative) ask because they can't guess my gender. But that's what it's for me. It may be different for your child, just like being a woman is different for different people.",
            "Therapy,  but it\u2019s absolutely ok to be gender fluid and explore gender! Therapy for everyone everywhere, imo.",
            "Trans-fashion among pre-teens and teens is just another identify construct that youth will play with as they have always done, and as is developmentally appropriate.  Freedom to explore all the different hair colors and cuts, clothing choices, and yes, within a safe parental framework, ideas about sexuality, gender, and identity.\n\n20 years ago, kids tried out being hippie, then ska, then punk, then emo, then hip-hop, then hardcore, then maybe even goth... it's precisely the same searching for where one is and where one fits in the world that is and will always continue to be a necessity of youth. Today, it's just more focused on gender identity, because that's the hot-button issue of the time, and mostly because it's the best way to attempt to inflame authority (parents, institutions, etc.).\n\nJust as you would not think your child was going to stark sucking blood and turning into a bat in 1993, you should not think your child is going to seek to surgically or medically change their body function until that particular concern is expressed specifically.\n\nHowever, your story for me stopped being about identity issues as much when you mentioned \" eating disorders, self harm, abuse recovery, compulsive lying\"\n\nThese 4 pieces of information require me to demand that you get off of reddit, and begin actually trying to help your child.  Abuse recovery is not like the others - this child is a victim of abuse, I take it - get the child trauma therapy by someone good at this - at least twice  a week for a minimum of several years before you consider anything else.\n\neating disorders are a form of self-harm both of which are highly correlated with having been a victim of abuse.  Compulsive lying is just part of being a teen, but likely exacerbated by feelings of A) rage about how flawed the system is, and B) literal hate for the world for making one's self exist (this goes back to the other self-harm).\n\nThe gender issue is not your problem here. The other shit is far bigger than makeup.\n\nedit:  word choice in the last sentence",
            "Let them take their time to figure this out. I came out as multiple things before I figured out what I really am. There's no rush to figure things out now, just keep trying different things and don't settle until you're sure. Therapy can definitely help with this. I commend you for being open about this, not everyone is so lucky to have a parent like you",
            "Growing up is hard, especially as a non-conforming child. I am non-binary and 25, I explored different identities growing up too. I would recommend seeking fellow parent groups or even local social resources for parents in your area. Parents of trans kids are pretty common in some areas now, and the need to find community to understand things/be heard/ask questions is real. Reddit is not the place honestly, it\u2019s toxic as fuck here",
            "I'm not trans, I don't have a trans child, but I love how you are caring for yours. Something that stood out to me was your statement about not feeling male or female. I don't know in what context or with what lead up, but maybe sharing that with your child at some point would benefit you both. You seem content with this blank space, even in the midst of trying to help your child feel known and understood in the context of their gender, so they may glean some of your peace and apply it to their own identity.",
            "Therapy.  It is an easy out and is actually the first step in any gender assignment step, which makes total sense.  You want to change your gender, no problem if after a whole bunch of consultations and therapy you are still game than go ahead.  Gender reassignment doesnt happen right away.  It is a long process to make doubly sure they are 100% committed to the process.",
            "As a clear person I\u2019ve seen a lot of good advice I do want to just say one quick thing for a lot of young queer people it is perfectly normal for them to have multiple coming out says they are trying to understand their identity it is most likely not a matter of attention seeking or anything like that it is simply them trying to see what suits them best. \n\nI absolutely agree that therapy for the other issues would be beneficial but I just wanted to make that comment known that there are a lot of queer people that for instance are gender fluid and their identities do shift back-and-forth as time goes and there are some people for instance that do identify as trans masculine but prefer being referred to as boy rather than man. \n\nAll in all right now it looks like you\u2019re doing a good job and you care about your kid you\u2019re trying to learn you\u2019re trying to do better and help your kid keep it up :)",
            "You kid sounds very confused, and it is very understandable. The concept of gender makes no sense. The best thing that anyone can do is acknowledge that \u201ctypical male\u201d or \u201ctypical female\u201d are just garbage concepts that we should abandon. People have a biological sex and that does not need to have any impact on their social role or behavior. The thought that it should has caused all of this confusion. \n\nPeople are individuals, not group members. Group membership is just an invention. Your kid should try to live their life without regard to which label they need to apply to themselves. Stop using pronouns with them and just use their name.",
            "Sounds like your child needs a psychiatrist tbh",
            "Trans child here (not really child but still19) \n\nI agree with the top comment they need therapy, and gender therapy You should continue on the the neutrality and maybe try and have a sit down with them so and ask about what it is that makes you think they are trying to get a reaction from you. \n\nI jumped threw a few sexuality\u2019s and one or two genders but I didn\u2019t go threw the whole rainbow (not saying that anyone can\u2019t). \n\nAs for explaining what it means to identify as a gender. I\u2019ll try to give an example but (warning I\u2019m terrible at examples).\n\nImagine your an over the top girly girl love all things nails,makeup, hair, heels the same kind of idea as a an over exaggerated woman/girl on a tv show that drives a Lamborghini or Ferrari. \n\nNow imagine she was being forced to wear joggers and trainers, no markup, short hair, and drive a dirty old truck. (Boy) \n\nThis theoretical girly girl would feel like she was in hell she wouldn\u2019t be able to dress the way she wants do her hair and makeup the way she wants she would feel very uncomfortable because this is not how she feels she prefers more feminine stuff and having to wear the boyish/more masculine stuff would make her unhappy and start to effect her mental health. \n\n\nI don\u2019t know if that helped I\u2019m bad at explaining and I\u2019m dyslexic so frequently stuff Doesn\u2019t make sense to others when it dose to me.  \n\nEssentially trans people feel wrong in the body they were born in to and it can destroy their mental health.  Like if someone referred to you with the wrong gender continuously and couldn\u2019t recognise that you were a female and not a male it would make you uncomfortable and destroy your mental health. \n\nI\u2019m not saying that all things trans are related to cloths and makeup or masculine and feminine stuff it is just what I can use for a best example any gender can wear buy or do what they want with whatever they want. \n\n\nI don\u2019t know if this helped or if you will even understand what I was trying to put across (my fault) I hope it did and I hope I haven\u2019t offended anyone if I have it\u2019s not my intention and most likely my bad explaining. Good luck to you both\ud83d\ude0a",
            "For the issue with your child, therapy, both by themselves and family so that you can be there for them.\n\nFor the question about identifying, honestly I don\u2019t think most trans people know. We just kinda know from incident from the past and present. When I was like 9, I told my parents that they were playing a prank on me and I was born a girl and they dressed me up in boys clothes. Also a common misconception is that it\u2019s because we\u2019re just masculine women or feminine men. This is also not true. My sister hates pink, rarely wears dresses, never wears makeup, and is in a male dominated career. My brother watched monster high, mostly hung out with girls, and played with my sister\u2019s barbies. I watch power rangers, transformers, and want to go into the same male dominated field as my sister. I\u2019m a trans girl the rest of my family is cis. I don\u2019t know, humans are weird.",
            "Sounds like you're doing your best. The top comment recommending therapy is spot on, but I want to add a few points:\n\nBeing into makeup doesn't make you feminine.\n\nOrientation, gender expression, and gender identity are all different and can change and that's fine.\n\nIt sounds like they're still a teenager, and teenagers kinda suck to deal with in general. That parts normal.\n\nIf they are upset that you can't keep up with their fluid and dynamic identities, that's likely a communication issue, which is completely separate from the identity they currently have. Getting upset with someone for not knowing something that wasn't communicated is irrational, and learning how to communicate those types of things is a crucial life skill. I recommend that y'all work on creating a system to keep up to date with where your kid is on the spectrum. Maybe a chart or wheel or some other publicly visible visual identifier inside the home can help. They update daily/as often as they want to say \"today I'm a she/her\" so that y'all avoid confusion.",
            "This sounds similar to one of my siblings. Me and my other sibling get along great, very little drama, just trying our best. The other one has debt, has had outbursts, lots of stuff, and has transitioned and detransitioned and has also been not the nicest at times. I think they're alright now but I've grown to avoid talking with them. \n\n\nI agree with therapy, and trying to be involved in that to make sure they are happy and progressing with the therapy. It is hard and I do not envy you here but I absolutely have experienced similar with my own family. At the end of the day, I just want my family to be happy, and I wish the same for yours.",
            "Sometimes people do things for attention.  I don\u2019t mean ego-driven \u201clook at me\u201d attention.  I mean the kind of attention where your child is trying to tell you something and they don\u2019t know how. They can tell you all kinds of other things, but not the one thing that is really bothering them. You mention abuse recovery, that is the kind of thing I would be looking for.",
            "I have a trans child as well. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible for a cis person, no matter how compassionate or progressive, to understand what it\u2019s like to feel that your gender is different from the one assigned to you. Reading people\u2019s firsthand accounts might help, but it\u2019s not fair to force them to justify their feelings. We just have to listen and believe that they are sharing their perspective as well as they can.",
            "You sound like a very caring parent and I\u2019d also like to commend you for seeking advice.\n\nIn my opinion, based on experiences I\u2019ve had, the core of what I\u2019m seeing in your child from what you\u2019ve described is consistent with an unstable sense of self. That\u2019s a core symptom in something called Borderline Personality Disorder. Self harm and eating disorders are also a major symptom of it, as well as \u201cdramatic\u201d moods and behaviors. This often comes out during the teenage years. NOT saying your child for sure has this, but it is something to keep in mind just as a possibility. I think there\u2019s at least 2 categories of transitioning I\u2019ve seen: the ones that seem to happen naturally (they may have *some* trans-specific struggles but nothing that necessarily consumes them) and it seems like their transition fits them like a glove to where they end up a lot more comfortable in their skin. But then there\u2019s the other category of people (usually teenagers) who transition a hundred times over and it often (but not always!) seems more to do with them looking for an identity, and less about them becoming who they are\u2026. Basically thinking this new identity or label will fill the void, and then being disappointed when it doesn\u2019t. Your child sounds like they might fall into the latter category. Doesn\u2019t mean their transition is necessarily invalid, but I would seek a therapist for them so they can feel secure in their skin regardless of how they identify. \n\nIf you end up getting a therapist for your child, they may take it as an insult at first and try to twist it as \u201coh you think I\u2019m crazy and I need a therapist *because* I\u2019m trans!\u201d If that happens, I would respond with \u201cNot at all. I\u2019ve noticed you\u2019ve had struggles completely unrelated to your gender identity, and I want you to feel good and safe no matter how you identify. The therapist isn\u2019t because I think you need fixed, but because I think you\u2019re dealing with a lot, and sometimes it can help to have someone to talk to who isn\u2019t a parent or friend. At the end of the day, I just want you to be happy.\u201d \n\nGood luck, teenagers can be difficult but you seem like a wonderful parent(:",
            "Your child is most likely none of those and just wants to feel unique and special.",
            "Lots of comments here saying your child would benefit from therapy, and I fully agree. But what I haven't seen are suggestions for you to get some counselling/therapy yourself. It sounds like a very difficult situation and having a professional to talk it through could benefit you directly and also the relationship with your child. Counselling has helped me through lots of obstacles in my life and I'd recommend it to anyone who's finding it hard to manage a stressful aspect of their life",
            ">You might notice up until now, I've referred to her as \"she/her.\" That's speaking to how it was then, not misgendering. About two years ago, they went through a series of \"coming outs.\" First lesbian, then bi, then pan, then male, then non-binary, then female, now male again. I'm sure I missed a few, but it's been a roller coaster. They tasted the whole rainbow. Through all of this, they have also been dealing with serious issues like eating disorders, self harm, abuse recovery, compulsive lying, etc.\n\nThey are in sore need of professional therapy, there's some serious stuff they're dealing with and a parent is in the wrong position to help them through it.  Sort through all of the extant issues before seizing on any one of those fundamental questions as an identity.",

Women typically consider lying in a chair or on a towel tanning an activity, so they're good for  a while, but guys seem to get bored of that more easily. The beach is a lovely place, but unless you're really into swimming in the waves, there's not a lot to do there naturally. Sure, you could play frisbee or football or fly a kite, but those all require lots of space around you that might interfere with other beach goers and mean you have to have planned ahead to bring items with you.\n\nBut one thing regularly available is sand. LOTS of sand (it gets everywhere). It's a wonderful tactile medium to interact with and is easy to build up and knock down. Plus it can be done in a relatively small space. Now obviously sandcastles are a thing, but they generally require tools and skill to do well, things not everyone has, and can get messed up. You don't want your beach activity to have the potential for failure and disappointment.\n\nBut a hole? You can't really get a hole wrong; you just dig deeper and make it bigger. Don't have tools? Well luckily your hands make good shovels. Or a cup. You've probably got a cup.  \nAnd a hole is great for group play, because while everyone has their own thoughts on how they would want a sand sculpture to look, they're all going to be on the same page for digging a hole. Bigger? Sure. Deeper? DEFINITELY! This means you're welcoming to new people joining in at any point, because there is little chance they can ruin your \"vision\" for the hole. As long as they're thinking deeper and bigger, they'll only help your goal. And now you've got people to talk to, about hole and non-hole topics. We're social creatures after all.\n\nHoles are great.",

            "It\u2019s instantly gratifying work. Us men yearn for our work to be fruitful. Big Work = Big Hole and no one is going to send us an email telling us our hole was dug wrong at the beach.",
            "My friend had an excavator, a bulldozer and a lot of land. We used to go to his place on the weekends to dig holes and fill them back in and then dig them again. \nNo idea why but it was a good time. Heavy machinery and holes to be dug and filled back in.

            "Every guy I know, including me, loves to dig holes. Big holes, small holes. Dirty holes, Sandy holes. Even the holes that had the rocks. I can remember every hole I\u2019ve dug so far.\n\nEdit: Grammar",
            "Ha ha reminds me of that scene from breaking bad with the meth head.",
            "Because you have a purpose (digging a hole) and instant gratification (hole gets deeper).  It can be teamwork (WE dig HOLE) and also cooperative/trading responsibilities (you dig for a while, I dig for a while, Bob digs for a while).  \n\nYou can get out of the hole and admire it.  Other men walk by and they think \"That's a nice hole\".  \n\nIt's simple.  We are simple.  We like simple things.  We don't like confusing things like:\n\nMe - \"Everything ok?\"\n\nWife - \"I'm fine.\"\n\nIn this instance, I am confused.  The answer is good.  But the tone sends a different message.  Maybe.  Now a million thoughts run through my head of \"What did I do?  What did I not do?  When did I need to do something?  When was I supposed to do something?\".  Maybe it's nothing.  But maybe it's something.\n\nIn the moment of digging a hole, the question is:\n\nWhy should I dig this hole?\n\nThe answer is \"Why not dig this hole?\"\n\nThere is no ambiguity, no nuance.  It's \"Let's dig a hole\" and there is no wrong reason to why to dig a hole.  It's not even a question - it's a simple statement that is driven into action.\n\nLike the men around it, the hole does not judge.  It does not say that it isn't getting dug fast enough, or big enough, the hole is simply happy being a hole.  There is no wrong way to dig a hole.  It simply is a hole and is complete in and of itself knowing that a hole is all that it will ever be, and that's all it *needs* to be.  It does not care how it's dug:  with hands like a dog trying to bury a bone spraying sand everywhere, or with a scoop or shovel.  Round hole?  Awesome.  Square hole?  Amazing.  Oval hole?  Incredible.  The hole does not say you're going too fast or too slow, the hole is happy with whatever rate of excavation you employ.  It doesn't care if you take a break.  Have a water.  A beer.  It does not care if you never stop.\n\nIt is, a hole.",
