Are their bodies set up for this type of thing? I'm curious\n\nEdit: I see people in the comments saying I'm being offensive to white people by asking this question and saying \"What if it was a question about black people? It would be reported and that would be offensive right???\" Please look up black people in the search bar of this subreddit. They're asked all the time and it never offended me. Stop being so fragile. People are curious and genuinely want to know. You can tell the difference between a troll question and a genuine one. ",

            "Evolution. Europeans developed adaptations to cold weather and northern latitudes that have less intense sunlight, including different facial and cranial features to protect against the cold, as well as larger or longer noses to heat cold air when it's inhaled. Light skin also helps maintain vitamin D levels with more limited sun exposure.\n\nThere's a reason populations living in countries closer to the equator tend to have darker skin and brown eyes. The melanin in the skin protects from sun damage and skin cancer. Brown eyes also act as natural sunglasses because they allow less light to pass through.\n\nOh the wonders of science!

Even though I grew up with winters being like -20.\n\nHowever I do remember all the boys in Michigan wearing shorts in the snow.

To oversimplify it a bit for discussion.). \n\nTraditional Chinese Medicine teaches us that bodily disharmony is described in terms of climate: Heat, Cold, Dry, Damp, and Wind are the 5 main categories, the last of which may be harder to imagine based solely on its name. Wind in the body is any muscle/connective tissue tension, especially when it remains, after using said muscle/ct; other examples are anything that itches, and any involuntary movement like a spasm or twitch. It can cause all manner of excessive-type behavior as well.\n\nAs for Stagnant Qi, it is just what it sounds like: Qi can and does stagnate, which can lead to disease. Qi should be constantly flowing, but does so at different rates, like so much traffic, depending on diet, lifestyle, environmental conditions, etc. This would be more along the lines of deficient-type behavior.\n\nWind and stagnant Qi can also combine; you can have excess and deficiency simultaneously, without that pull/push dynamic being equal and opposite. \n\nMany people have heard of RLS; there is also Restless Arm Syndrome. At their core, Wind & stagnant Qi are the same phenomena as a knuckle that likes to crack when moved just right (but not habitually or continuously - that\u2019s more obsessive in nature). Especially when abrupt, like in the punching example. You don\u2019t have to have knots or rigidity to have chronic Wind, and it doesn\u2019t always follow an obvious pattern.",

She yelled and I pretended to wake up, and tried to hide that I was, in fact, awake when I'd accidentally sucker-punched her.

            "Many times a patient will need more time than what was scheduled, these extra times add up towards the end of the day. The alternative is to leave big gaps between patients but that means each doctor would service a lot fewer people which would both decrease services and increase the cost/patient.",
            "I think people tend to forget how little time an appointment is, all you need is three patients go over the allotted time (often for good reason) for your doctor to accumulate a 30 minute delay if not more before the afternoon has even started.",
            "I work in a primary care office. We try *really really really* hard to stay on schedule.  This generally means you go into a room as soon as you walk in and you wait in the room for ~20 minutes. There are a number of things that can back us up:\n\n1. Patient needs a lot of extra time (going through a tough time and needs to talk, needs an EKG or other services, etc).  It sucks to wait, but if you\u2019re the one who needs more time, you\u2019ll be happy you get it when you need it. \n2. Someone walks in with an issue that really needs to be seen, so we have to put them in. If they had called, we could have worked them in better. \n3. The doctor keeps getting calls from the hospital regarding patients who are admitted/need to be admitted. \n4. Patient didn\u2019t tell us about testing they\u2019d had done, so we have to call around to track it down. \n5. Patient is late. A few weeks ago, a patient was 7 minutes late. It set off a cascade of events leading to us getting 45 minutes behind.\n6. The doctor isn\u2019t feeling well and just can\u2019t move as fast as normal.",
            "So they dont get overbooked or you are waiting for days as they open. Sounds like you need a different doctor, mine most times are within 10 minutes of us getting in a room and another 5-10 till we see the doc. They get behind, what typically takes 10 minutes may turn into a 45 minute test.",
            "I bring a book and a bag full of patience.",
            "From a different point of view, in specialties, doctors are giving their expertise to each patient and often spend lots of time where it's needed.  For example you have no idea if the patient before you just got diagnosed with a mass in their brain, the patient before that suddenly lost their hearing a week ago, and the patient before that one has facial paralysis from a massive infection in their mastoid pressing on their geniculate ganglion.  Coupled this with the fact that reimbursement stinks and many of these well intentioned doctors are pressed to see more and more patients on their schedules.  I used to feel the same way as you until I was one of those patients with a mass in my chest.  The doctor took tons of time with me and I knew I made him about 30 minutes behind at least for the next patient.  But I will never grumble again about my wait times now, even for a simple health issue of mine, because I know how important it is that others get the care they need.",
            "Sorry this is long.\n\nSpeaking as the clinician, I usually have my nurse room 3 patients at once. One appt that should take a longer time and two that are quick. If a patient is late the next patient that has arrived is seen first. We actually have a policy that if the patient is 15mins late we don't have to keep the appt, but most of my patients are cancer patients and sometimes drive up to 2 hrs to come to clinic, so I will usually be willing to extend my day to make sure everyone that arrives can be seen. I can have emergencies come up, patients that have to be admitted to the hospital, or need to spend extra time with a patient which can all extend appt times past the allotted time. We are also required in a lot of places to see so many patients in a day by the hospital/office administration.\n\nSo as a patient you're upset because your appt is an hour late, but you don't think about the fact that the clinician is spending an extra 30 mins explaining that a person has stage 4 cancer before your appt and will stay in clinic an extra 2-3 hrs of their day (when they also want to go home) to make sure every patient is seen/heard/treated, notes are done, and orders complete. We do our best...",
            "clinics have to stay organized somehow.\n\nIn a perfect world everyone would show up 10 minutes early, not ask additional questions, be triaged appropriately 100% of the time and every visit would be in and out.\n\nPeople come in really sick sometimes and that delays things. Sometimes they need breathing treatments, ER transport etc. That takes a good chunk of time.\n\nmany patients show up to an appointment with extra questions, multiple concerns in addition to the one the scheduled for. Or they are late. Or both. This can take up significant time for a provider and delay everyone's time in clinic.\n\nSometimes patients come in for a really concerning thing that should be a double appt time to address but it gets scheduled for less and that screws things up.\n\nPatients ask additional questions. Which sometimes require a longer visit depending on the severity.\n\nLong story short medicine never goes according to plan. That's why here in the United States at least you should plan on 30 minutes to an hour of your time for a check-up visit.\n\nThat's why I always sincerely thank patients for being understanding when they've waited a long time for reasons outside my control. As a provider sometimes there's just nothing I can do when shit happens.",

            "It can be frustrating. I saw many comments saying to set it up first thing in the morning, which I try to do. I did that once for the second time slot after the office opened (8:15) because the doctor wanted to do a fasting blood lab on me. When I arrived, the waiting room was packed. On the sign in clip board, everyone except me was a walk-in that morning. I didn't get called in for my appointment until 11:30. I waited in the exam room for another 2 hours before the nurse came in and took my vitals. 30 minutes later the doctor finally arrived and said my blood pressure was elevated. Hmm, Doc, let's look at the tape to see why!",
            "I work in an office with 4 docs.  One of the docs rolls in 30 min late often. Kids to drop off, etc.\n\nThe other docs are only ever behind because a patient showed up ___min late for their appt and demanded to be seen, so the doc\u2019s whole day is now at least ___ min behind.  You would be amazed at how many people show up late for their appts and get mad at me because we can\u2019t see them. They show up 10 min late for a 15 min appt,  what exactly do they expect? \n\nWe have certain patients that we are not allowed to schedule in the first appt of day slot or first appt after lunch just so they don\u2019t mess up the whole day.  \n\nThat\u2019s also why you don\u2019t see clocks in doctor\u2019s offices.",
            "There's also the issue of \"door knob questions\". Often people come in for a mundane problem but after 15min when you're leaving the room they'll ask a critical question. For example, they schedule a visit for a minor rash but as you're about to leave the room they say 'oh and by the way I've been getting chest pain for the last few days whenever I walk\". Often it's because the patient fears the response so they ask the question in a cursory way hoping the doc will dismiss it and as a result reassure them it's minor.",
            "Most doctors actually care about their patients and want to take the time to hear them out. You think waiting for a single appointment for 2 hours sucks? Imagine finishing work 3 hours late every single day. Especially here in the UK where you don't even pay.",

            "Asked my father the same thing when I was little (he's a general surgeon).

            "Thought id answer this from the doctor perspective  - a lot of people have answered it, but incase anyone finds this or scrolls down! I think it's useful for people to know how or what is going on as I understand the frustration of people's perception of what is going on, but equally a lot of people don't actually understand what is going on or what a GP does or even what a doctor does.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1.) Patients running late. In GP land/in the UK especially- a-lot of times if one patient runs late or arrives late, then it throws the routine or schedule of the surgery/clinic off. The surgery list often looks or varies between 15 patients ( some surgeries more or less), plus telephone calls/extras at end or emergency messages in between. These go at 10 minutes, with occasional 10 minute breaks in between. Its literally non stop stress as most problems are not routine, and the only way it runs on time is if people arrive on time, I run on time, and realistically people only present with one problem. But this never happens as reality is not like that!\n\n You can refuse to see someone if they arrive late (and this varies from clinician to clinician) but equally sometimes you do have to see the patient regardless of wait (eg psychiatric emergency, unwell child). Sometimes these people may have been triaged also by myself during lunch time or the morning (will get to this later)- if I have a concern or high risk worry about the patient, and they're running late- I will still see them. There is also the aspect of medico legal standing- I often do turn away patients if its a routine problem and they have arrived eg 15 minutes late or missed the appointment. However if for example an unwell child arrives late or mum is running late with said child, I think a lot of GPs will oblige having to see the child- the risk to an extent is high and believe it or not, whenever I refuse to see anyone- the standing lies with me as a clinician (regardless of whether they completely missed their appointment by an hour), so I could get pulled up for that medico-legally or have to defend myself if something happens.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo sum it up- if for example I triage in the morning on the phone, a young patient who is an eating disorder with co-morbid depression or anxiety, who is feeling suicidal or concerned they're relapsing, and their BMI is 14 or so,  but they run over by 5 minutes on their expected slot- and arrive late- I will still see them-Im not going to turn them away. Usually I tend to compensate personally by asking people (which often I still feel I should say I don't want to see it but as a compromise) to wait until my break or the end of surgery and Ill squeeze them in. Personally speaking i don't have to do this- but I do it on occasion- but this is purely my way of working- believe it or not people who have missed their appointment by an hour, still have the audacity to shout at me etc or reception staff for having to rebook and refusing to accept my interim measure (which isn't even something I'll be honest I want to do as my surgery just never ends)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2.) I cause myself to run late/dealing with unexpected issues\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy this I mean patients are expected in the 10 minute model to present with one problem theoretically allowing one solution. However a lot of people don't. I always try to deal with patient's problems, but realistically the time set is for one problem only. I appreciate people become quite upset regarding this, and appreciate also the delays in appointment times, but equally i'm not going to do an unsafe job.  Also some people present with complex symptoms or problems that are very grey- this causes delay on my end as often I might have to think about what to do. This is clinician caused delay (which I apologise for but stand by as at the end of the day- I need to do whats safe for you)\n\nHowever like the above- sometimes Im obliged to deal with something even if it goes over 10 minutes. Believe it or not, patients do come with more concern over a sprain, but then mention at the end they've been having crushing chest pain, or they've lost weight and have blood in their stools, or they're hallucinating/hearing voices, actively suicidal etc. Also certain patients may require hospital admission or me to discuss with a specialist due to the nature of the problem- or simply I might not have the answer, but the issue needs sorting out. This adds a delay as hospital clinicians are equally busy on duty on wards/clinic, arranging admission to a ward I need to print out a discharge summary, but also discuss with appropriate clinician to ensure they accept. This is all not 10 minute worthy- but sometimes amazingly you can still do this all within about 15 minutes if your'e lucky, and catch up (or even 10 minutes if your pepped up)  \n\n\nAn example I'll give is if a patient presents with a leg swelling, and I think it might be a blood clot- this needs ruling out and depending on where you are, the DVT (deep vein thrombosis) pathways are set up differently- I might need to contact or book an ultrasound, start blood thinning medication (as well as assess their risk to take this- involves BP checks, clarify history etc), filling out multiple forms vs a phone call to a buys hospital in some areas, or other surgeries with a set up service. One place isn't the same, but issues like above can cause delays. Also on top of this another issue that occurs is people have no transport to get to hospital, or families/patients come up with reasons to not go to hospital, and sometimes even argue about this. This can add extra delay.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso another one is sometimes the practice nurse or even another GP might want me to look at a patient, due to concern/complexity/uncertainty. Hence depending on what it is, this can cause delay. Waiting for a chaperone for exams (eg breast, genital)- as the chaperone most likely may be a practice nurse who has his/her own list. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n3.) Duty on call doctor/emergency visits\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother reason you may have to wait is- as the GP or doctor I might be tied up on a home visit which has entered the realms of complicated or again may require as above organising admission to hospital. Often this may be due to unexpected psychiatric emergencies (someone who is delusional or newly psychotic, behaviour worrying family), complicated palliative patients, or simple family dynamics of situations or concern over welfare. Often in these scenarios I ring ahead to warn people and apologise. These are rare. But equally not beyond the realm of day to day- often I might have 2/3 home visits to do- all over the area. \n\n  \nLunchtime in my experience is not lunch time at all but extended catch up of morning running late, doing about 1-2 home visits (or even more), rushing through paperwork and scripts, phone calls, going through blood results  and on top of this doing these visits. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso Duty Doctor On call- this is the on-call doctor. Usually rotating around one of the regular GPs in the surgeries one day of the week. Different surgeries have different set ups- some have an allocated day for the doctor to do the duty slot (eg only emergency patients/surgeries or tasks only), but also some surgeries do this on call slot on top of your regular surgery (so extra phone calls, emergencies, deciding if someone needs a visit all sandwiched between these 10 minute appointments). This can also add delay.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hate surgery delays as much as the patient does- as it means I finish late. My finishing time is not 8.30-5pm as most people assume, its more like 8am to 7pm/8pm in my experience often. This is because i'm going through making sure my documentation is ok, blood results (and acting on these- these can be about 30-40 blood results in your inbox), letters needing actions, scripts, phone calls/other admin that got missed out due to running behind etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNHS is falling apart, not enough doctors, and extreme pressures on service. All of this boils down to create the above situations to a degree as well. We basically need more doctors and GPs especially (along with Psychiatrists etc), but no one wants to do the job as to be honest (and who can blame them). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo next time you see your GP, I hope you can kind of understand the context of what is going on or why you might be waiting (or any hospital specialist for that matter as the reasoning will be similar).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope this helps/answers for anyone interested\n\nApologies if any typos.",

Because people have absolutely no idea what's going on, and neither do we until our staff start troubleshooting.  Sometimes something that seems catastrophic is a five minute fix.  Sometimes something easy takes a tech a full day to resolve.\n\nThe human body is so much more complex than anything we deal with it's unbelievable, especially so with a general practitioner who's fielding oddball complaints and questions that *might* point to something serious.

Questions are asked, additional tests are conducted. It takes longer than anticipated and unfortunately puts the technicians and the doctor behind. \n\nSometimes patients call for an ER appointment because they have a foreign body in their eye, an infection, etc. that needs to be treated immediately. We cannot refuse care to patients just because we have a full schedule. It sucks, but it\u2019s the way it is.\n\nSo when you go to the doctor for your 11am appointment and aren\u2019t called in until 11:45am or 12pm, it\u2019s usually for a good reason if it\u2019s a reputable practice.

We got many calls that day with people saying they just \"had to get in.\" We can't possibly see everyone!

That's 15 mins per appt that has now turned into 7.5 mins. My doctor doesn't hurry people in and out because he has ethics and knows it's bad doctoring so the medical assistant, x-ray tech and myself got no lunch and didn't leave until after 5.

Then I imagine the doctors come up with a quick plan or have an idea of what they need for you, while dealing with other people already being treated. There's 2-3 doctors for like 10 of those waiting rooms, when they leave your room they're going into someone else's room or getting materials, typing something into system, every little conversation or event is more time you're waiting for your appointment.

I understand that puts him behind, but also appreciate what he does.\n\nUntil I showed up 15 minutes late one day and the receptionist told me I wouldn't be seen until the end of the day because I was late. Holy shit I was pissed. I asked her if that meant he was going to be on time from now on, and things had changed. I wasn't quiet about my displeasure and the waiting room was packed. When I finally sat down, several people told me how much they agreed and appreciated what I'd said.\n\nWhen I finally saw him, I laid it all out..

            "There are two theories that address this.\n\nThe first argues that having *some* homosexual individuals is good for a society by reducing overpopulation during times of abundance. One of the pieces of evidence for this theory is that one of the factors that correlates with being gay is birth order: the more older ~~siblings~~ brothers you have, the higher a boy's chance of being gay.\n\nThe other theory is often called the *Gay Uncle Theory*. This argues that having a homosexual sibling is good for your ability to pass on your genes, because gay siblings are childless relatives. As childless relatives, they will be invested in helping *your* children (who are, after all, their nieces and nephews) survive - perhaps by teaching them, bringing them food, protecting them from predators or adopting them after the deaths of their natural parents. Since you share 25% of your DNA with nieces and nephews, having a gene that made it likely that your relatives would be gay would be a positive trait that natural selection would favour.\n\nEDIT: This is getting a lot more attention than I'd expected. I'm going to be turning off notifications for this comment now!",
            "Natural selection isn't a process that selects only traits optimal for survival 100% of the time. There is a lot of randomness associated with it, so evolution does not continuously progress towards some creature that is \"perfect\" for survival. Many traits are byproducts of this randomness and don't even need to be helpful to an organism's survival to exist and be passed on.\n\nNassim Nicholas Taleb has a chapter about evolution in his book *Fooled by Randomness* in which he explains this a bit more.",
            "Homosexuality has no bearing on your ability to reproduce and historically children and families were seen as a sociatal duty rather than a product of love or attraction.\n\nJust look at ancient Greece.",
            "Think of it like this. Straight people have gay kids. So it's not like a gene where you pass it down directly like eye color. \n\nThere's not a single \"gay gene\" that makes you gay. Genetics is WAY more complicated than that. Think of it more like \"If you have a combination of these genes, you are more likely to also be gay.\" But the trick is, if the combination of those genes also, say makes you more likely to have better hand-eye-coordination, or faster reflexes, the benefit it may have genetically may outweigh the negative of potentially having purely homosexual offspring.",
            "There\u2019s a couple of things I want to correct you on. We have found homosexuality in a staggering number of animal species across the world. It is generally thought that the reason gay animals exist is to care for offspring who have become orphaned in species that do that (such as penguins, many examples there). Even if that\u2019s not the case, evolution does not work to make the fastest or strongest or scariest animal, only the one most adept to their environment, simply by what survives and what does not. It doesn\u2019t have intentions. It\u2019s like throwing spaghetti at a wall and seeing what sticks, the spaghetti that does may not be the best ones, but they lived to pass on their genes. \n\nAs far as science knows, there is no singular gene that determines someone\u2019s sexuality. They have tried unsuccessfully to find one for years. I personally hope they never do with the world as it is. That would lead to a genocide, likely government mandated or encouraged. Sexuality, gender, and genes are far more complicated than we can understand thus far.",
            "Nobody really knows why some people are gay. There seems to be a genetic component because people with gay siblings are more likely to be gay. But definitely most gay people have straight parents, and plenty of gay people have straight kids so it's not so clear how the genetics work.",
            "New scientist ran an article on this a few months back. Iirc something something only holds tight if you consider only 2 types of people; those exclusively straight and those exclusively gay. But sexuality is not like that. Instead it best considered a spectrum.  Yada yada.  \n\nEdit; at this stage of the game, i'll fuck anything!",
            "I don't think being gay is purely genetic but even if it was, there are spontaneous mutations that happen all the time.",
            "In addition to the \u201cgay uncle\u201d theory already stated, we have to remember that homosexuality was not widely accepted until recent times. Many LGBTQ+ individuals had to hide their sexuality and (in many cases) marry and procreate with the opposite sex to avoid prosecution or social shunning. A lesbian in the 1500s didn\u2019t have the option of just being a lesbian and marrying a woman. She was socially expected to marry a man and produce children. And with bisexuality being common, it\u2019s very likely that everyone has at least one LGBTQ+ ancestor.",
            "I don't think there's an actual definite answer, but I think it's a combination of:\n\nA. Scientists are pretty sure there's no one gene that cases homosexuality\n\nB. Gay people can and do reproduce\n\nC. Being gay may not be entirely genetic",
            "Being attracted to same-sex partners does not *prevent* someone from reproducing. Plenty of gay people have had sexual encounters with people of the opposite sex.\n\nIn the evolutionary past, female consent was barely a thing.

            "> If homosexuality is a darwinian trait that would be selected against, how can you be born gay?\n\nHow could someone be born susceptible to allergies? How could someone be born with a birth defect? How could someone be born with albinism? How could someone be born left-handed? How could someone be born blind?\n\nHow could anyone be born in any way other than the absolute, 100% most evolutionarily advantageous configuration possible?\n\nBecause evolution is both mind-numbingly simple and outrageously complicated at the same time.",

            "Maybe because it's not a Darwinian trait? There is no 'gay gene'. We don't know why people are homosexual. It's as common in the animal kingdom as it is in the homosapiens. There isn't an answer for every question.",
            "Homosexuality is actually good for society, they serve a very important role in a number of species, mainly as adoptive parents and providing assistance for other parents (also why it is important that homosexual couples be able to adopt)",
            "The problem lays in thinking a given gen always means X trait. True is only a handful of genes are singlehandedly responsible for a particular trait. Most of them participate in a lot of different traits by working with others, and in many cases environment plays a role as well in if those gens will express themselves.   \nSo, answering your question, there most likely isn't a gen responsible for itself for a person being gay. Being gay can be describe as a trait, but that trait may express only when a handful of different genes get to express themselves in tandem with the rest, and probably with environment pressure. So most likely all of us have some genes that participate in the \"gay trait\", but we lack the rest of those genes. Furthermore, as why a \"gay trait\" would develop in the first place since is \"contraproductive\" for reproduction, answer is most likely it didn't develop at all. As I said more genes have a lot of effects, so these \"gay genes\" can perfectly be genes responsible for traits that mutated in hopes of reproduction and survival, but had the unforeseen effect that when expressing themselves together made people gay.",
            "Historically, at least in europe, many gays were forced to hide it and have offspring.\n\nAlthough gayness isn't as black and white as one gene.\n\nIt could be similar to left handedness (which also was considered \"evil\" during our history) . There is 10 % chanse that right handed parents have left handed kid.\n\nLeft handed parents havevonly 33 %.",
            "Homosexuality is NOT necessarily a trait that would be selected against. There is an old saying, \"I would die for *my identical twin, or *two siblings or *two children or *eight cousins.\" The idea is that you don't *necessarily* have to pass on your genes *directly.* Supporting your family group also protects your genetic heritage, because a percentage of your genes lives in each of those people. \n\nIf it was only about having direct descendants, then women would never enter menopause, since menopause limits the number of direct descendants a woman can have. But it's been proven many times that a wise female leader, unencumbered by small children, does much to maximize the survival of her family group.\n\nLikewise, adults who don't produce their own children help to support the family. In zoos, gay animal couples support and nurture orphaned and abandoned young. Young men, in sexual relationship with older men, help to form a formidable fighting force. Lesbian aunties take stress off young mothers.\n\nIt's not a simple as some people would like it to be. Of course, our studies of homosexuality, unencumbered by social bias, is still very young, so there is much yet to be discovered.",
            "I have no knowledge on the subject, but I'm interested in your sources claiming homosexuality to be genetic. Most publications I've looked up found little correlation between the two.",
            "I dunno I always kinda thought there was just a natural urge to fuck anyone? In the ancient world people often had homosexual relations and a wife at home too.",
            "If a trait is conserved across populations then that means it's being selected for, not against. Self removal from the breeding population is a major downside for darwinian fitness on the level of the individual, but often times it's queer folk who end up adding robustness on the level of the family, village, or larger population. Everything is a trade off. Color blindness isn't really color blindness, it's higher acuteness for contrast. To someone who's colorblind, everybody else is contrast blind, and so colorblind ppl can see animals in foliage better. That's why it's conserved, despite having a downside. Human populations need to be diverse in order to be robust. \n\nGay folk remove themselves from the breeding population, which is a major downside if you care about passing on your genetics. But often times gay folk end up being more open and creative, so in a way they end up passing on their legacy memetically, as opposed to genetically. It's a trade off that's needed for a rich culture, and often times for political progress. \n\nOne interesting thing is that, if I'm not mistaken, you're more likely to be gay if you're the younger brother. It's like once the family has gotten the genetic legacy covered, there's then room for someone who's focused on other things. Would love to know if this is true for women as well, if it's not just total bs I read somewhere.",
            "The core of your argument, that homosexuality is naturally selected against, is wrong because it ignores the fact that sexuality is a spectrum. There are plenty of people that engage in homosexual activity who also engage in heterosexual activity (see: greeks, romans) therefore enabling them to pass along their genes, including those associated with their homosexual tendencies. While strictly homosexual people may never pass along their genes, they could easily have a bisexual ancestor (or more likely, a few) and any of their siblings could also carry those genes.\n\nI'm not an expert in biology or genetics, but logically you can see how homosexuality would persist through multiple generations when you acknowledge that it is a spectrum.",
            "The best explanation I ever read, and forgive me I can't remember the source, had to do with the X and Y chromosomes merging at the time of fertilization.\n\nIf we all remember from our biology class, every cell in our body has DNA that is a complete blueprint for that individual. Some cells can divide, splitting the DNA, then make exact copies of themselves.\n\nExcept for sperm and egg cells, they only have half of the DNA and can't make copies of themselves. The magic occurs when the DNA from a sperm and an egg merge to create a new individual. It is at that exact moment, based on a 50-50 chance, that a master gene determines the gender of the new individual.\n\nBased on that master \"switch\", some gene sequences are turned on and some are turned off. For example, whether there will be ovaries or testicles. Countless genes are turned on or off based on the master gender switch.\n\nAs far as *physical* characteristics of the new individual go, it's pretty straightforward. Sometimes things don't go right and the offspring may be rejected by the parents (in the animal world in general and in humans up until recently). So correct physical characteristics have been selected for over eons.\n\nBut there are also genes for the development of the brain and other organs that control hormone production over the individual's lifetime. This doesn't always go 100% according to the master plan either. A male individual may have some female genes that control these functions and vice-versa. When this happens it's not always fatal so the individual survives to adulthood. There is no natural selection for this. Which is why we see it across the spectrum in the animal world. If there really was an individual gene for it, it would be selected against.\n\nSo really, there is no \"bad gene\" or unfavorable environment or anything like that. The merging of the DNA from two individuals into a new one is an *extremely* complex process that is difficult to comprehend. It doesn't always go right and we all have to deal with how nature built us.\n\nThis is what I told my son when he asked me why he was gay, since obviously, neither his mother nor I was anything like that. I told him that he would be much happier in life by accepting who you are and to try to find someone you can share that happiness with.\n\nEdit: I may not have all the exact details right, it's been a while since I read the article.

The reason for this is that gay people will alleviate some of the parents' burden by doing work while not putting further strain on the family by having children of their own. Gay people are also more likely to be socially adept and funny, which also strengthens the social bonds between family members.\n\nTLDR: Homosexuality may be the result of an epigenetic shift triggered in the fetus if the mother is exceptionally stressed.

            "I read no long ago that some scientist found a gene that gave a predisposition to like men more. The cool part was that it was found both in women and men, so in theory some of the men with that gene would be homosexual and not reproduce, but the women that had it would compensate by having more children on average, hence passing it on. Obviously homosexuality is much more complex than just a single \"gay gene\", a number of genetic and environmental factors must play a part, nevertheless it is interesting to think that, even if at first glance homosexuality may look like a trait that would be selected against, once you study the genetics of the matter, that may not be the case.",
            "There are three main reasons a gene that reduces reproductive potential (fitness) can yet be adaptive and selected for. First, there's gene linkage. This is simply the fact that genes that are close to each other on the chromosome tend to be copied together. So, if a gene that reduced the likelihood of reproducing by 5% is situated right next to a very critical gene that increased the likelihood of reproducing by 20%, they tend to be copied together as a package, with a net increase of 15%. So even though a gene that has a negative impact on reproductive success, every time it's copied it brings along with it the genes for a 20% boost. Second, there's genetic altruism. This is most commonly illustrated with wolf packs, where most of the wolves forego reproducing to serve the pack, and thus increase the reproductive capacity of their genes by helping other wolves that are genetically related to them reproduce more effectively. Therefore, a gene that makes an individual lose their reproductive capacity might also have an effect on increasing the reproductive capacity (fitness) of related wolves. This makes the \"effective fitness\" of the gene positive despite the lowered reproductive potential of the individuals carrying the gene; in essence, social groups are more fit (having a higher reproductive potential) if that group contains elements that carry this particular gene, which also has the effect of making those who carry it non-reproductive. The gene is carried through the relatives of the non-reproductive members of the group that don't express the gene, but the entire group benefits by having the increased reproductive potential as a related group. The third reason is more basic: the expression of a gene has two components: the genetic component, and the environmental component. So gene X can code for expressed trait Y when the environment is of type A, but the same gene X can be expressed as trait Z in a wildly different environment (B). All human genetics evolved in nomadic hunter/gatherer pre-literate small family group situation which is so alien to us that we can hardly conceptualize what those social conditions looked like. In those situations, the genetics for what is today expressed as homosexuality might have been expressed completely differently. It might have benefits like increased language ability, better warfighting, the ability to encode cultural knowledge in songs or stories, art, hunting and tracking, etc., and it might have had no effect on reproductive output, or the opposite effect. In short, the gene might have a wildly different expression today than it did a million years ago when it was crucial to survival. \n\nHope this helps.",

            "Something quintessentially important here is to define homosexuality. It's commonly defined as either the preferential attraction to someone of the same sex, or the behavior of having sexual relations with someone of the same sex.\n\nIn animals, we can only see behavior. So homosexuality can only be defined by behavior, not attraction, in their case. In people, it's more appropriate to define someone who is preferentially attracted to the same sex as homosexual, as many people can have sexual relations with someone of the same sex and not identify as homosexual (think prison sex as an example, or people who just experiment, or those who identify as something else).\n\nThat being said, someone being attracted to the same sex can still have sexual relations with the opposite sex and pass on their genes (that may or may have \"gay genes\"). A \"gay gene\" would only be \"selected against\" if it stopped the person with it from being able to pass on their genes in time.\n\nHowever, we really can't say people are \"born\" gay until we have a better understanding of the relationship genetics has with sexuality.\n\nA safer answer to this this issue would be that there are genetic predispositions to the preferential sexual attraction to certain characteristics that are more commonly held by someone of the same sex. Which would mean that no one is \"born\" gay, but are more likely to identify as gay given certain environmental factors.\n\nYour question is a very good one. I hope we as a society can get a more concrete answer at some point.",

Maybe even just a recessive gene, meaning you'd need both straight parents to have the gene. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis doesn't answer how specifically homosexuality is created, we don't know how. But these are just ways you can be \"born with\" something without it being pure darwinian genetics.",
            ">Homosexuality would be a trait that natural selection would be selected agaisnt. It's hard to pass on genes if you dont have offspring.\n\nYour premise is not necessarily true.  It's based on the assumption that all traits that are biological are genetic and handed down in some kind of dominant fashion. And that there is only one origin of homosexuality. See, a tendency towards homosexuality may not be due to genetics, but to the  environment of the uterus during pregnancy. For example, there's the premise that the younger a boy is in birth order, the greater the chance that he will be gay. The explanation is that \"the increased incidence of homosexuality in males with older brothers results from a progressive immunization of the mother against a male-specific cell-adhesion protein that plays a key role in cell\u2013cell interactions, specifically in the process of synapse formation, during development called neuroligin 4 Y-linked, or NLGN4Y.\" ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5777082/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5777082/)) In other words, an immune system attack on a developing fetus results in homosexuality, but it's not a 100% kind of thing. It only happens sometimes. And it may be beneficial, given he \"gay uncle theory\" or the overpopulation theory. The mom's immune system develops a stronger and stronger immune response with each pregnancy of a boy.\n\nAnother possibility is that homosexuality is a recessive trait. So it occasionally manifests itself but usually there are genes that are transmitted in people where that gene is not expressed but pops up every few generations or so when two people have the recessive gene and have a kid. This can actually keep a gene being pretty common in the human gene pool. Or it could be an issue of a gene with a complex expression. An example is with the Rh negative blood type. If a mother has Rh negative blood but an Rh positive child, then her immune system will attack the fetus's blood, which is almost always fatal. Except for the first born baby, which may be OK because her body hasn't yet developed the antibodies to the positive blood. About 15% of people have Rh negative blood. If two negatives have a kid then there's no problem. If the dad is positive and mom is negative, then that's a huge problem that may result in them having no children or just one child, which is pretty unsuccessful in evolutionary terms and might result in it disappearing from the gene pool. But it doesn't because negatives have kids together and are fine, or also the gene for Rh negative is passed down in people with one negative and one positive gene.\n\nThere's also the issue of how we define one's sexuality. Historically, many people who had sex with someone of the same sex also had sex with someone of the opposite sex. They didn't have strict divisions into homosexual and heterosexual. A man with strong sexual appetites might want sex with men and women. \n\nAnother issue is that who is to say that gay people don't have evolutionary success in the form of having children? Most gay people I know have children nowadays, and historically people tend to enjoy being parents, even if they might not so much enjoy sex with someone of a different sex. They can still have sex for the purpose of being a parent, even if their preference might be for same sex recreationally.",
            "Humans have sex for pleasure, not just procreation. Being homosexual doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t reproduce. It\u2019s just an attraction to the same sex.",
            "No one is born gay (though it's certainly not unnatural). It's a perceptual loop that arises through mutual-causal factors naturally present in one's environments (same as all perceptual feedback loops). \n\nIt's the same thing with our personalities and our thinking patterns. I study feedback loops as a hobbiest expert. That's how I know this.",
            ">Another way a \"gay allele\" **might be able to compensate for a reproductive deficit is by having the converse effect in the opposite sex**. For example, an allele which makes the bearer attracted to men has an obvious reproductive advantage to women. If it appears in a man's genetic code it will code for same-sex attraction, but so long as this happens rarely the allele still has a net evolutionary benefit.\n\n>There is some evidence for this second theory. Andrea Camperio-Ciani, at the University of Padova in Italy, found that maternal female relatives of gay men have more children than maternal female relatives of straight men. The implication is that there is an unknown mechanism in the X chromosome of men's genetic code which helps women in the family have more babies, but can lead to homosexuality in men. These results haven't been replicated in some ethnic groups - but that doesn't mean they are wrong with regards to the Italian population in Camperio-Ciani's study.\n\n\n[Genetic Influences on Male Homosexuality](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9780470015902.a0025332)",
            "I love how this specifically assumes that gays are an unwelcome trait instead of thinking\n\n\"Well idk why it would be selected, any insight?\"\n\nI must say, the question how it is stated is very suspicious for me  ..",
            "So there's first a few assumptions about heredity, genetics and evolution that always need to be adressed up front:\n\n1) basically the viability of any gene comes down to if that person reproduces or not.  You can have a genotype that expresses later in life like huntingtons disease and still pass it on; it's technically viable because most people who would have kids have often already done so before it manifests.  Not everything that gets selected for has a net positive effect on the species survival.\n\n2) if they reproduce that gene has to be passable and not have a bunch barriers.  A lot of genetic diseases result from various other processes and are not actually directly heritable, like down syndrome or other chromosomal abnormalities\n\n3) the gene can still be passed even if it never gets expressed.  Varying degrees of expressing a certain genetic phenotype is called penetrance \n\n4) epigenetic mechanisms like how women basically deactivate sections of their X chromosomes or the mechanism behind how calico cats get their coloring, methylation, or other factors that affect transcription, translation and such all play a major role in whether a gene ever gets expressed\n\nKeeping that in mind we have to first assume that being gaybis a heritable trait, of course a pretty disputed idea already.  \n\nThe easiest answer could be that it is naturally selected against since if you're gay, you probably won't reproduce.  That explains why homosexuality is a trait exhibited by a small minority of people.  Perhaps it's recessive or just very rare to begin with.  It could also be co-dominant like blood types and it could just be the AB blood type of heritable sexuality where you need a parent with one gene and the other parent must have the other, then they must both give you the correct respsctive allele.\n\nIt could easily be a dominant gene that's easily heritable but has barriers to expression and low overall penetrance.  There could be a certain stars-aligning element of epigenetic mechanisms required for you to express the trait. This would explain why it could still be passed on even though being gay means you probably wont have biological kids.  Things like Prader-Wili and Angelman syndrome require the stars to align for both having the right genes and having the right sections of chromosomes selectively inactivated for the traits to manifest.\n\nIt could also rely entirely on epigenetic mechanismsn meaning that it has no heritability and only requires you to inactivate, transcript and translate the right things at the right time in order for it to happen.  This is what usually opens the door to people theorizong about behabioral, emotionaln societal amd environmental factors that might make somebody gay and how younkight need both the genetic propensity as well as the right outside factors.",

            "Many species that rely on social groups for survival are designed to *not have* every adult reproducing. From wolves and hyenas to prairie dogs and meerkats. These species depend on the efforts of several adult animals raising only a few offspring to adulthood. One or two pairs in a group reproduce and the rest of the family group combine efforts to make sure that their siblings, nieces, nephews, etc survive. The ones that reproduce are the most aggressive ones or have the most proclivities to reproduction, while adults that have less of a drive to fight or reproduce will accept roles as caregivers. \n\nThis way, an animal that does not feel a strong drive to reproduce with the opposite sex can still pass on *some* of their genes by helping to raise the offspring of their siblings.",
            "This is already burried, but... the premise of this question is flawed because at this point in time we consider sexuality to be an identity. This is a very new phenomenon. Historically, sexuality was an act, not an identity. A person was not homosexual, but they had sex with people of the same gender (in a two gender/sex system). Moreover, the social structure typically encouraged heterosexual relationships for the purpose of reproduction and social obligations. This did not exclude same sex experiences. They just weren't part of the legal infrastructure that passed on property rights. People want to have sex for different reasons. Sometimes it's because you're attracted to someone and other times it's because you need to make a baby so that you have someone to work in the house and inherit property. The same person can have both kinds of sex with different people, consentually. \n\nWhat this means is, even if you were on the hard core gay disgusted by hetero-sex side of the spectrum, there were a lot of incentives for you to engage sexually with the opposite sex at least a couple times in order to meet social obligations (which is far greater than family pressure). \n\nGay identity could not have been a natural self-selecting quality because there's very little historical evidence of gay identity, only evidence of gay sex.",
            "I love the theories that are presented in reference to natural selection, but my thought on this whole thing is this:\n\nThere are lots of things that occur naturally that one might think was a detriment to a species, but as long as there are no external factors to make you pay for those \"short comings\" then it will never be bred out of your gene pool.  Take sloths for example, lay people often ask how they didn't go extinct given the fact that they move so slowly and don't really have any way to defend themselves.  Easy... no natural predators in their habitats. They can move as slow as possible.  Same for pandas whom I've read really only ever poop and eat bamboo (which isn't even really nutritious enough for them and that's why they have to eat so much of it.)\n\nJust like our species has no natural defenses like scales, fangs, claws, shells, thick fur.. our big brains have made it to where we compensate just fine without them.  The same would go for homosexuality.  Homosexuality didn't create a situation in which it would need to be bred out, because (surprise surprise), homosexuals can still have sex with women. We have big brains that can override \"instinct\", unlike many other animals on the sentience ladder.\n\nIn many ancient cultures where homosexuality wasn't taboo, what was still culturally expected was to marry and bear children with a woman.  \n\nTL;DR: Natural selection occurs with environmental pressures.  No pressure, no marked change in a particular gene attribute.  Our big brains have made it to where homosexuality presented no environmental pressure.  Homosexuals still had babies.",

That would be REALLY FUCKING WEIRD. \n\nI\u2019m being blunt and unspecific intentionally since that\u2019s an entirely other humanitarian topic, but there\u2019s really zero scientific interest in this overall because it would not benefit society in any obvious way, and has a litany or possible issues with discovering it.

When the obligation to provide child support is challenged by men who allege that their sperm had been stolen or otherwise used to inseminate a woman without their consent, courts will typically enforce the doctrine of\u00a0strict liability: namely, that a man is liable to support a child conceived with his sperm, irrespective of the circumstances of conception, including any criminal conduct on the part of the mother.\u00a0Plaintiff arguments of\u00a0tort\u00a0liability for\u00a0fraud\u00a0or\u00a0misrepresentation\u00a0typically do not hold up.

Then it would be her word (I would assume) of either consentual sex to make a child, a beoken condom situation or whathaveyou, - against Drakes insisting of assured protection etc.\nNevertheless there would likely be a child carried to term as she can\u2019t be forced to abort on Drakes behalf. And then is when it gets actually juicy as childcare payments (and overall care for mommys lifestyle) etc would come into place. Which, after all, is most likely  the outcome that was hoped for by the alleged sperm thief. Now how could a man in this situation get out of paying for an unwanted child ? and there would definitely medial repercussions as well. That\u2019s what\u2019s fucked up, the use of the creation of a child for monetary gain (and maybe presumed fame-by-proxy). \n\nActually almost like 20years (iirc) ago something not too unlike this situation famously allegedly happened to former Tennis star Boris Becker. Who, unbeknownst to him, became a father to a child after having a stint with a model (.. !) in a broom closet - being on the receiving end of a blowjob (even though one might say, that it was indeed her, who received after all). \nAt least that\u2019s his version of events. \nFinally the child was brought to term and he got sued into oblivion for child and mothers care + ridiculed to death. (Mind you that the child infathomably is as much in his likeness as can be, so if there ever were no need for a paternity test, it would be this exact situation)\n\nI\u2019m not saying that fathers should be able to get out of their responsibility. But such neferious actions as alleged in the Drake situation (not the hit sauce, that\u2019s at least self defense and hilarious) should be punishable. Unfortunately if there is no confession and no video of the exact events taking place, how would that man be able to get out of paying, and more so, becoming a father with all the responsibilities that brings with it? Not to meantion that it can\u2019t be great for the childs developing psyche and self worth once (and it will) it will be made aware of the events leading to its conception\u2026\n\nAll in all THIS is what I would personally describe as r/AwfulEverything .

Then, we almost went extinct according to our DNA, which shows we bottle necked at one time with probably only a few thousand of us left. \n\nWe happened to be the last of our kind, when all other human species similar to us went extinct.

It was one of many compromises that gave balance to the powers of the individual states.  \nEvery state gets 2 senators, so they each have an equal say about laws being passed, presidential appointees, and some other things.  \nEvery state gets representatives based on population *but we only counted slaves as 3/5 of a person for a state's population.  \nEvery state gets electors equal in number to their Senators and Representatives.   \n\nIf the Electoral College doesn't reach a President, then the House of Representatives gets to vote - with *only one vote* per state.  \n\nOur Federal system is designed to have the voice of each state heard.   \n\nAnd, the States have individually decided that they're going to give the entirety of their electoral votes to one winner.  They don't have to.   A couple of states do count individual districts, and can have split votes on elector appointments.",

I\u2019ll try my best to answer with the most clarity.\n\nSo if you think that, on paper, a bunch of \u201celectors\u201d sitting together and being able to decide upon their personal favorite candidate despite the popular wishes of the majority sounds elitist, then you\u2019d be right. At its conception, the Electoral College, as it had come to be known, served as a bulwark against what the Founding Fathers saw as \u201cthe tyranny of the majority\u201d. Say you\u2019re an elector (a party elite, property owner, etc.) and you were worried about demagogic, potentially tyrannical leader who had the popular support of the people. Your solution in this regard would be to cast your independent vote, thus safeguarding what you believe to be the well-being of the nation. Despite popular opposition, you and your 435 peer electors would have the de-facto final say on who gets to be president.\n\nThese days, this seems terribly elitist and invites the \u201ctyranny of the minority\u201d. Unsurprisingly, many states have, in a way, tried to minimize this by punishing \u201cfaithless electors\u201d (those who vote opposite of the popular vote in their respective state) or ensure that electors are adherent to the party line. These days, most electors vote with according to the their own state\u2019s popular vote total (there have only been a handful of faithless electors in the past decade and their effectiveness has been minimal). So the question remains, why is the Electoral College still an issue?\n\nThe issue primarily lies in the Winner-Takes-All (WTA) system we have in place for most states (Maine and Nebraska being notable exceptions). Under WTA, the candidate who gains the popular vote wins all of the states electoral votes. For example, in a single state during a general election, Candidate A wins with a 53% vote. Regardless of the dissenting 47%, Candidate A will receive all of the votes that the state has. In effect, that 47% of people who voted against Candidate A lose their representation. This is why the national popular vote winner can be different from the actual Electoral College winner. \n\nThis has a variety of consequences, the biggest one being the difference between the national popular vote winner and the Electoral College winner being different. However there are other consequences. This situation is precisely why the term \u201cbattleground states\u201d exist. Because of WTA, there are simply states that are more valuable for a candidate to campaign in than others. A Republican candidate, rarely will make the effort to campaign in a state like Texas (which typically supports the Republican party) or California (which typically votes Democratic). Rather, they will focus their attentions where victory/defeat is more hotly contested. Because of the Electoral College, presidential candidates are incentivized to ignore some states in favor of others. Because of the Electoral College, as long as a candidate maps the geography of their winnings right, it won\u2019t matter if more people voted against them.\n\nSo back to the original question: why does the Electoral College *still* exist? The answer is not really clear. Precedence? Tradition? Who knows. Every time the election comes around, people come out of the woodwork to defend this seemingly obsolete institution that has deviated from its original purpose. All that can be said, is that while the Electoral College exists, the question of \u201cDoes my vote actually matter?\u201d will, unfortunately, remain pertinent.\n\nEdit: typo",
            "So the biggest reason is that the electoral college only decides _one_ election. The presidential election.\n\n_Every other election_ is at the state level or lower, and is by popular vote.\n\nSo if you never vote because you're confident which way your state will go regarding electoral college votes, congratulations: you've missed four years worth of other, arguably more important elections.",
            "Because individual voting is what decides the electoral college.",
            "Like other people said, the electoral college votes with the popular vote (in theory). There's actually nothing stopping them from voting for Vermin Supreme.\n\nThe electoral college is only for the Presidential election though. Senators and House members are elected directly by the people.\n\nThe electoral college was setup because the founding fathers didn't trust the voting populace to vote smart. This wasn't to disenfranchise anyone, as the system for voting in the first place already did that. Initially you could only vote if you were a white, male land owner.\n\nPersonally, I think the Federal election should be based on federal districts, not states.\n\nEach district counts as their own vote, so split states actually split their vote.",
            "To answer your edit question, there were a few reasons for the electoral college to actually be people, and basically all of them are outdate or have been deliberately undermined.\n\n1) there used to be a major delay between votes happening in the state and getting word to washington. This not only meant you needed reliable messages (a person as opposed to a letter for example) but you needed real people to adjust their vote if something changed between what states knew and what was happeningnin washington in December.\n\n2) the founding fathers were kind of pretentious and didn't think very highly of the average voter (even if restricted to white men). So they wanted to make sure that actual smart people had a buffer to change their mind if the public voted in a dumb way.\n\n3) you might have situations where the first vote didn't go through. The vote was split too many ways and changes to votes had to happen to arrive at a majority. There was no time to send a rider back to Indiana to get a revote. You needed people who could hash it out \n\nIn a period no of instantaneous communicationn of it being illegal for many electors to change their vote, etc basically all tge reasons for having the electors be living humans as opposed to votes on a scoreboard are basically no longer relevant.\n\nThis is a totally different argument from giving rural states extra power. This is just referring to that power being expressed through humans.",
            "Most states have an all-or-nothing vote for their presidential candidate. So once more than 50% of voters in each state vote for one candidate, *all* of the votes for that state go to the one candidate. And the number of electoral votes are not exactly proportionate to the number of people in that state. It's based on members of Congress, so every state gets an \"extra\" 2 votes (out of 538 total) regardless of state size.\n\nSo, two big differences from popular vote: winner takes all, and extra 2 votes for each state.\n\nThus, states which heavily favor one candidate over another, like Massachusetts or Idaho, have less influence, because there's no advantage to getting more than 51% of the vote. At the same time, \"swing states\" like Ohio and Florida become much, much more important, since they're pretty close to 50/50 between the candidates. Since it's winner-take-all, a few thousand voters can result in *all 29* electors in Florida going to the other candidate, which can decide the entire election. Finally, because the U.S. population is so heavily packed into a few states, by giving every state 2 extra votes, it means that states like Wyoming or Delaware, which would ordinarily have too few people to matter, can still affect the outcome.\n\nThere are good philosophical arguments in both directions as to whether the electoral college is a good idea, but the purely practical matter is that in the last dozen elections or so, the system has given the Republican Party a massive advantage. They're not even shy about it - there is a Republican funded program called \"REDMAP\" that you can easily google and it will take you straight to a Republican-funded page explaining how they rely on the Electoral College program to stay in power. So it's not going to go away unless Republicans are literally powerless to stop it.",

However your vote plus the 10 people the volunteer or friend contacted do start to add up.\n\nSome of the biggest electoral college votes are decided by a few thousand votes. The electoral college votes are winner take all. If in Wisconsin there are 500000  votes for candidate A, 500100 votes for B, and 1000 for C, B will take all 10 of Wisconsin's electoral votes (270 to win)\n\nLet's say your state always swings blue.

            "The US has 51 Presidential races.  Each state (plus DC) has Electoral votes relative to its population size, minimum 3 up to California's 55.  If a candidate gets a plurality of votes in that state, he/she wins all of the EVs.  The exceptions are Maine and Nebraska, where each Congressional district counts for 1 EV, but they rarely split.\n\nSo in reality, your vote doesn't count for much if you are in a highly partisan state like Idaho or Vermont.  In the \"swing states\", the polls show very close races, so voters in Florida, North Carolina, Iowa, etc. have a lot more influence on who wins the Presidential race.\n\nThe candidate who wins enough EVs to total 270 or more wins the Election.  They meet in their state capitals in early December to cast their predetermined votes, which are sent to Congress.  Congress certifies the results in early January.

            "So first off, the electoral vote and the popular vote have only been different 5 times, all the other times they went in the same direction. \n\nSo what happens is, in all but 2 states you only have to get 51% of the votes in that state to get ALL the electoral votes for that state. These are called \"winner take all\" states. \n\nSo let's say you get 20 million votes in California. That earns you a majority, so you get all 55 electoral votes in that state. But you wouldn't get a single additional electoral vote if you got all 39 million votes in California. \n\nThis usually happens in states with smaller fewer electoral votes. So let's say you get every vote in Idaho, 1.8 million. Now that will only get you 4 electoral votes, that's all Idaho has. HOWEVER, let's say you get 1.8 million votes in Utah instead. Now, you had more people vote against you in Utah, but you still got the majority, so you get all 6 electoral votes. This is how you can sometimes lose the popular but win the electoral vote.\n\nThe electoral college is super important, because if we did it on straight popular vote, high population density cities would be the only places with any real voting power. HOWEVER, winner take all states are a bad thing, because they make it so 4.7 million Republicans in California and 6.2 million democrats in Texas essentially throw their votes away every election cycle. Many of the founders were against winner take all states, but it got written in anyway. The electoral should be split according to the popular vote like it is in Nebraska and Maine.",
            "CGP Grey on Youtube did a great video explaining this. From what he's said, individual votes still matter; but part of the electoral college means that if you live in certain states, your vote essentially means *more* than the vote of someone in a different state. That's how, very occasionally, it is possible for a president to get \"voted in\" when they technically had *less* votes than the opposition. It depends which states voted for who.   \nApparently the logic was that it was supposed to stop politicians from only paying attention to a tiny fraction of states (aka the biggest ones); but it doesn't really work that way, and CGP clearly demonstrates and explains exactly *why* it doesn't work as intended. Basically the politicians can still use exactly the same tactic of only paying attention to a couple of states; it just changes which ones. \n\nIronically, rather than preventing votes from mattering, it can actually mean that getting individuals to vote matters *more* than it otherwise would - aside from converting people in the \"important\" states to your side, if you're in a \"less important\" state and you want a win you're gonna need *more* people in those states to vote than you otherwise would. Because one vote from another state might be worth *four* of yours.   \n\n\nWorth noting that a lot of other countries that also use that style of voting *don't* have an electoral college at all. So it's not a necessary feature or anything. My country has no electoral college, and our vote is worth the same no matter where we live. But then, our population is also a lot more concentrated, because most of our country just can't support big cities. And we have far less states, which might play into it.  \nIt's also illegal not to vote in my country, which solves a lot of \"getting people to vote\" problems - and it doesn't sound like that's the case in the US.",

More specifically, it was implemented with the intent to make sure the political will of smaller states was not overlooked and made irrelevant. It does this by giving a little more mathematical-political weight to smaller states than they would have if the presidential election process was carried out via a straight popular vote. In effect, this gives an arguably unfair political advantage to the conservatives of the country as more conservatives tend to reside in rural and small-town areas.\n\n\"Weighted votes\" describe how much weight the individual vote of a citizen from one state has over the individual vote of the citizen of another state. This is calculated by looking at the states' population amount/electoral votes ratio \n\nFor example, when comparing Wyoming (a very small and conservative state) to California (a very populous and liberal one)... the presidential vote of a citizen from Wyoming counts for three times as much as that of a California citizen.",

The EC is the compromise they came up with. At the time it was created, no other country democratically elected it's leader so they were wading into unfamiliar territory. It was never something that was held up as a perfect model, it's just the product of compromise.\n\nAs for why there is so much importance placed on individual voting in the USA? First, you'd better vote because you vote for nearly every office at the same time, including a ton of down-ballot elections that can be (literally) decided by a few votes. Second, even if you live in a solidly red/blue state, if everyone stayed home or changed their minds it wouldn't be so \"solid\" anymore. \n\nI am registered to vote in the District of Columbia so objectively my vote matters least of anywhere in the U.S. Basically I'm voting for city council and some ballot initiatives.

            "To tackle the original question \u2014 \n\nIndividual votes count only at the state level across the board. \n\nThere\u2019s only one national elected official. \n\nThat election must reflect the nation.\n\nUsing a raw vote would skew the results towards the largest population centers, leaving the rest of the nation unrepresented in the one national office. \n\nSo the vote is tempered through the electoral college to force the election to be a real national election. You can\u2019t appeal to a few big populated area to win you have to appeal over a much broader section of states. \n\nWe\u2019re not a democracy, nationally speaking. We\u2019re a republic. So we use a republic\u2019s representation to decide the one national elected office.",
            "The electoral college makes up for the people who don\u2019t vote. \n\n\nThe basic idea is that people living in each state are more likely to vote for the same person than compared to someone from outside the state. So, as an example, if Alabama is republican, you\u2019d expect the general populous to vote republican. But since everyone isn\u2019t able to vote (because of work, illiteracy, or just plane not wanting to) that doesn\u2019t mean that those who couldn\u2019t vote aren\u2019t allowed to be represented. So the state decides that if you don\u2019t vote, the chances are that you would have most likely voted for the same person a majority of your neighbors voted for because you have lived in the same areas and been raised around the same ideas. \n\n\nSo let\u2019s say (completely random and wrong numbers incoming) that in Alabama there are 1,000,000 people and is given 100 delegates in the EC. If 450,000 people vote republican and only 50,000 people vote democrat, that\u2019s gives a total of 500,000 out of a million votes. Based on these votes, it\u2019s reasonable to assume that most of Alabama is voting republican; so the EC decides to step in and put one million peoples worth of votes into the election pool even though only 500,000 voted. \n\n\nThe EC, love it or hate it, was originally meant to protect the people. In my opinion, the EC should only be disbanded if we can get a much larger turn out for voting (such as make it mandatory or make it a holiday). Without everyone voting, and with no EC, we would still see funky elections like we have for Trump and Busch.",

The electoral college is set up to allow for representation across the country. What may be right for an urban New Yorker may not be right for an agriculturalists in rural Kansas and different still for someone in suburban Cleveland, for example. \n\nA straight popular vote makes sense on paper but the size and geopolitical variation of our nation necessitates some alternate form of representing these different life ways.",
            "If I remember right, the electoral collage was ment as a safe guard against unwanted influences in our elections. Take the 2016 election for example, there was concerns about Russia hacking us and changing votes, so it would then be up to the EC to use that information to make a decision on weather or not to vote for that candidate that state choices. The reason why individual voting is imported is because it allows the EC to know which candidate the people of there state want, also many states now gives all their EC votes to whoever wins the popular vote in the state they represent.",

Congressional races, state office elections, and municipal elections are almost all won by popular vote. Additionally, your state\u2019s electors vote based on who wins the state\u2019s popular vote. \n\nSo in 90% of elections the popular vote determines the winner, and in presidential elections your vote still influences the EC.",
            "replying to your edit: \n\nA lotta people in the US have been failed by their education system and do not understand the founders' reasoning behind the EC. It's truly probably the single most important part of the election process and is THE reason the US has been able to seamlessly acquire land and quintuple its size over the centuries with varying cultures and people in the states. \n\nFirst, some simple civics. A state has X number of congressional districts, which each have varying populations within them. Congressional districts are not the same as counties. A major city can be split into several districts. When a candidate wins 51% of the vote in a district, they win that district. Win 51% of the districts, you win the whole state. In theory, if you win every rural congressional district with 1000 people each but lose the districts with cities of a million, you will still win the state, as long as you win more districts in the state. That's how you can win the popular vote (like most democrats do, most cities are democratic and rural areas aren't) and still lose the electoral college, because they lost the state. \n\nThis seems wrong, right? Why don't we just make it so that popular vote wins? This is why. \n\nWhen you say \"Voting with extra steps\" you're alluding to direct democracy with extra steps. Direct democracy doesn't work outside of like, small towns and cities. 63% of the population lives in 3.5% of the land mass. States like Wyoming, Montana, hell, the entire Midwest, would never see a candidate campaign there if not for the Electoral College. \n\nThis means the midwest and flyover states have a say in the election. Even though they have fewer EC delegates than, say, TX or CA, they still count. And candidates DO campaign in flyover states. Those states add up. If it were a popular vote, candidates would just go to the East and West coast and campaign there. \n\nThis means the rancher in North Dakota has as much say for president as the stock broker in New York. It keeps the country together through the election process. \n\nOn issues like coal, oil, or other blue collar jobs, the smaller states would have absolutely zero say in the matter even though those issues affect them way more than a state like NY, just because they lack the population. Is that fair? alienating an entire state? No. That sows contempt for the election process. \n\nTrump won states like WV and WI because of his campaign promises that would affect those smaller population states. The coal industry has nothing to do with NY, but without the electoral college, it wouldn't matter what WV or WI wants. They don't have the population needed for a president to care. He just needs that 51%. \n\nSee what I mean?\n\nThe system isn't perfect. No system is. Anyone can admit that. But it's just about near perfection. And it's the reason our country has grown as large as it has while other famous empires, like the british, fell apart due to lack of representation at the fringes.",
            "The EC is necessary in order for smaller states to have a say in who gets elected. If the President was decided solely on the popular vote, they would only campaign in San Fran, LA, Chicago, NYC, etc. The majority of states wouldn\u2019t even matter/have a say in who was/is elected.",

And I don't just mean \"oh, well, your vote is just 1 vote out of millions -- a drop in the bucket\" No, I mean you actually have exactly 0% influence. That's because, regardless of if a given state is 51% blue or 99% blue, 100% of the elector's votes go to blue. Moreover, if you vote red in a blue state, exactly 100% of the elector's votes still go blue.\n\nSo, you are actually wasting your time by voting in anywhere that isn't a swing state, which is most states. About 100,000,000 people might vote in a U.S. election, for example. If we assume every person spends, on average, 10 minutes voting, then that's 1,000,000,000 minutes, or about 16,700,000 hours. Now, I'm sure that some of those hours aren't wasted. But we can confidently say *millions* of hours are wasted every year on voting... imagine if we dedicated that time towards social causes. Volunteering, fighting for a cause, or working a job & donating what you make.\n\nI know someone will give me a long list of points as to why this isn't the case (trust me, I know the arguments for the electoral college) but I'm going to say this anyways:\n\nfuck the electoral college.",
            "For your edit. The electoral college protects the minority vote. If you live in a state that doesn't have a massive city then your population will be much lower. So to keep the minority of thoughts closer to equal thats what the electoral college is for.\n\n\nEdit: just read a bunch of comments. It's extremely surprising how much people in the comments don't know about our own government. Also really scary.",

            "There is none. According to [this CGP Grey video,](https://youtu.be/tUX-frlNBJY) the states are essentially free to vote their electoral college votes in a winner take all fashion, proportionally, or against the citizens. That being said, you should vote because assuming your state is moral and votes proportionally, purgatory where they invalidate the loser of that state's votes, but the winner still gets points so that your lesser of two evils candidate gets the points for your vote, or your vote is ignored and given to the other person.",

            "A lot of other answers here do a good job explaining why things were set up as they are. I just want to add that we still have an electoral college because the constitution is hard to change, especially when one party is getting a tangible benefit from keeping things the way they are.\n\nVoting is important, and it's especially important for senators, congresspeople, and your state and local government leaders, all of whom can have a much larger and more direct impact on your life while also winning an election with a much smaller amount of support, so you vote matters much much more at the local level.",

You don't really see election strategies involving campaigning to people living in low-population states.  But I think you'd see even less of it without an electoral college.",
            "Basically a presidential candidate gets different numbers of \"points\" for winning different states. If you live in a \"swing state\" aka a state that could swing to either party, your vote super matters. \n\nI live in Montana which is a reliable red state so my vote doesn't matter (for POTUS). So I will vote for 3rd party. \n\nThe system is \"democratic\" but its designed to weight certain voters more than others to make sure that certain candidates always have an advantage.",

            "One state can\u2019t dictate the rest 49",
            "Because the ones who vote currently made bad decisions as we saw with trump. If you want the most suitable candidate to win, everyone has to exercise their vote.  You won't know the value of one vote until it's a collective thing that can change the polls so quick",
            "Your electors represent your area, the popular vote in the area wins the electors in most states. Lower population areas have their votes weighted so that population dense places don't hold all the power. \n\nImagine a bunch of farms with a city in the middle, if popular vote existed then the needs of the farmers wouldn't matter. If the city wanted water diverted from farms to help with gardening, they'd get what they wanted. However, with weighted electors, the farmers get to say no and keep the water for their crops.",
            "Actually it doesn't always vote the same was the popular vote. Was very public call outs about that last election. Popular vote means nothing in reality. It is LIKELY that the electoral college will vote the same as the districts they represent. But they are in no way legally obligated to vote the same. Anyone who says otherwise is wrong."

She asked what I was going to do after the workout and I just said go home and make my protein shake and shower, she wanted to see how I made a protein shake but she was acting a little flirtier than usual.

            "Well I'm not a doctor or anything, but I would imagine a healthy adult applying minor stress to their body will induce a higher production of hormones in order to cope with the input, so yeah, horniness ensues as nature intended. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm really bad about working out, and go hard for a while and then do nothing but drink alcohol and work (bad), but when I do I notice changes all around, like, more and darker/thicker hair on the underside of my forearms/upper back. I think it's related, as is your return to having a sex life. Fair well, captain.",
            "It is for you!",
            "Yep. Blood flow and increased testosterone too. Works for both men and women.",
            "Yes",
            "Yes.  Absolutely.",
            "You probably also got excited from the females at your gym. Even if you\u2019re a perfect gentleman, the ladies in their sweatpants/ yoga pants can draw your attention. Subconsciously I mean of course",
            "Don't hit the gym what has gym ever done to you?",
            "No doctor here but I've heard that working out raises your testosterone. Might not feel like a lot normally but maybe going from quarantine sedentary to active  you do. TMI and personally I used to get horny a lot post workouts. \n\nStill waiting for two weeks to pass after getting the second shot so I've just been doing home workouts (when the motivation is actually there). This fate awaits me as well.",
            "Testosterone is a hell of a drug",
            "Hell yeah spread that seed as a far as covid.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yes it\u2019s pretty normal for me. When I eat healthy, get enough sleep, and workout regularly, I end up just wanting to fap all day XD. I get boners when I do heavy squats \ud83d\ude1b",
            "What\u2019s libido?",
            "Mine went backwards because I was so worn out.",
            "[deleted]",
            "My mom tried to convince me the opposite would happen. I started biking and going out more and I\u2019ve been ever hornier",
            "Yeeessssss",
            "Yes. It\u2019s one the reasons I swim 2 miles over the weekend. It\u2019s worth it.",
            "Idk the science behind it but maybe bc I\u2019ve felt it",
            "Test and increase in blood oxygen levels lead to boner town USA.",
            "It is completely normal it\u2019s your body reacting to your blood pumping again and when your blood pumps it pumps everywhere including your libido I recently experienced this after not going to the gym for a year and holy crap I could probably outlast the confederacy",
            "Yep. \n\nWelcome back to life.",
            "Yep.",
            "I\u2019ve found the opposite when I injured my leg and couldn\u2019t walk for a couple months that my libido took a hit.",
            "Yes.",
            "yes, totally normal",
            "Working out increases testosterone in men. May explain",
            "Hell naw haha you're just catching up",
            "So glad I wasnt the only one",
            "Libido spikes.. what a polite phrasing for something that can get quite uncivilized.",
            "yes. Gym makes dick go brrrrrr.",
            "Congrats",
            "u/Hungry-san I have the exact same situation. Went from running daily at my job with 40k steps to couch potato. Just started lifting weights and swimming lanes again and my libido is off the charts. Did ur bloodpressure rise a ton during the last year for you too?",
            "I'm not proud of this but it tends to affect me similarly. Though it's somewhat cancelled out since I'm both tired from my workout so I can't even think about any of that but also like that girl I've been casually staring at made me fantasize some shitty gym fantasy. Or I guess since I think I casually stare at them they think I'm a creep for staring too much but oh well",
            "You increase blood flow to every part of your body, get a sensation of contentment from exerting hard work, and you are around people at the same time!",
            "Could be hormones from other people at the gym too",
            "If you are a guy, working out will turn you into the underwear hammer man.",
            "Bruh I can't believe you answered my questions with this post. When I turned 18 I felt hornier for no damn reason. It must've been because of gym for fucks sake",
            "Yes. Arousal is all about good blood flow. When you get in better shape, everything is affected. Hormone levels, libido etc."
