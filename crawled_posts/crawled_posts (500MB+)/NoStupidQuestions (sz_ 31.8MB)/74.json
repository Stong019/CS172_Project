A [closet](https://www.familyhandyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/FH16FEB_565_51_048-1200x1200.jpg) is a small room or a recess with a door, while a [wardrobe](https://www.homesdirect365.co.uk/images/victorian-antique-french-style-wardrobe-p35231-30601_zoom.jpg) is a piece of furniture.\n\nEDIT: That is to say, wardrobes are a thing in America, and closets are a thing in Britain.

You're trapped in the closet!\" To which Germaine replies \"It's a wardrobe, Aretha. We're not in America\"\n\nAretha then continually insists that she'll only let Germaine come out of the closet if she agrees to stop making lesbian jokes about her, while Germaine continues to correct her that it's a wardrobe, not a closet.\n\nIt's a really good show.",

I'll have heard everything, but my brain couldn't turn everything I heard into information in my mind fast enough, so I missed bits. This can happen with reading as well.

While this may sound counterintuitive, it trained me out of the habit of being distracted while reading because it highlights the word you should be reading and gray's the rest out. You can see the rest of the text faintly, and you can set the reading speed to a good (200-250wpm) pace. That's fast enough to mean you gotta stay focused on the words, otherwise it moves on, but not too fast that it feels hard to follow. Using this method, I went from not reading a single novel in 5 years because of the bad focus, to reading full books in 4 days (and remembering them). The app is free, and you can get almost any book you desire for free as a downloadable ePUB format from the web. All the classics are available and a personal recommendation would be to read Journey to the Centre of the Earth by Jules Verne.",

One reason is the complexity of the text. Text books, reports and academic texts tend to make you do this because there\u2019s a density of information so you might need to re-read things.\n\nNext, it could be a focus thing. Try not to read when you\u2019re tired. It can result in re-reading stuff.

When I'm reading to retain and learn as much as I can, I will re-read a paragraph or thought until I feel I've grasped it in it's fullness.  For example the first more philosophical book I ever read was Mere Christianity by C.S. Lewis.  This was my first experience with non-scientific mid-level academic philosophy/theology and I was only 13 at the time.  I had to re-read and look up words to start to grasp the concepts.  But, after about a week of reading through and revisiting chapters I wanted to understand better I began to follow his arguments and it was great prep for easily dropping into philosophy classes in college.  Got easy As in all those classes.  \n\nI've always had high reading levels and can even speed read a bit, though I don't prefer it.  Having three kids and a busy family life I dropped off reading regularly for a few years and have only recently been getting back to reading more regularly.  As for your situation I can't say for sure.  You have to consider what material you are reading.  I think most average people should be able to breeze through fiction and may struggle with mid-level academic books.  I'm at the point where I can look at material I'm largely unfamiliar with and start to tease out the more important points even if I don't know all the nomenclature of the subject.  Then if I really want to know more it's often just a matter of googling definitions.",

Usually I actually DO retain information but I feel like I\u2019m missing out which is one of the biggest hurdles people face when reading.\n\nNow I\u2019ve just about doubled my reading time!",
            "It's 100% normal.\n\nHumans go through an [ultradian cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultradian_rhythm#%3A%7E%3Atext%3DIn_chronobiology%2C_an_ultradian_rhythm%2Cperiods_longer_than_a_day.?wprov=sfla1) that affects how well our brain does at certain tasks like focusing. \n\nAdditionally, while where you're at on that cycle may impact how easily distracted you are, everyone gets distracted at times from external stimuli like the noise of someone walking by or the smell of fresh coffee brewing. The brain is horrible at multitasking while maintaining a high degree of focus. It's good at multi-tasking on certain tasks but with less focus. You can also get distracted by your own thought process drifting. Lots of people (including myself) have bragged shot multi-tasking skills but the data shows its just not true. \n\nIn addition to where you're at on your internal cycle, our bodies can just be influenced in ways that makes it harder to focus on certain things. If you're too amped up from a stress like a fear you might not be and to focus. Similarly if you just scarfed down a bunch of food and feel sleepy you will likely have less ability to focus. \n\nAll of this is normal although some people may experience certain things worse like those with adhd. But losing focus is natural to humans and doesn't automatically mean you have a mental health issue like we seem to portray in society.\n\nSome books are easier to read and follow and others require more work by our brain.\n\nThere's so much more to all of this. If you're intrigued, I highly suggest the book Thinking Fast and Slow and the Andrew Huberman podcast. The former is a book by 2 people that basically rewrote how we understand the brain handles thinking and problems. The book focuses heavily on cognitive bias. The latter is a podcast that goes into details on mechanisms that impact our neurology and tools to improve your life,  from sleep, learning, exercise, muscle building, mental focus etc based on the latest high quality research.",

But I found out for myself that if I'm on the phone very often and then pick up a book, I kind of have to learn how to concentrate first. With books as a distraction in your free time you have to actively pay attention, while your phone shoots information at you for hours. So when I look at a book after getting used to being on my phone all day my brain is like \"??? Where are the pictures??? Where are the sounds??? Can we swipe???\"\n\nI'm not sure if that's a real thing though, just something I've experienced",

But I learn to at least try to grasp the general idea of what it is comveyed.

            "When you cut an apple, knife presses it's flesh together and juice comes out. Juice = more taste = good.\n\nAlso you chew slices more, because it's less of a hassle and you get to taste them before it's all mixed with your spit and diluted. Which means even more juice in your mouth.\n\nMost food tastes better in smaller proportions. ",

The same reason you pour wine into a decanter and let it air out. The same reason an extremely thin slice of cheese tastes better than a big fat chunk. The same reason sipping Nestle Strawberry milk from a spoon tastes better than chugging it from the bottle.",

Have you ever peeled a whole apple and taken bites out of it? Its a much more satisfying experience, thats probablu why slices taste better, because it allows you to taste the sweet part of the apple first. And it fits conveniently in your mouth as a morsal.

A slice of cheese would have a different flavour from the one of a mouthful taken directly from a block of cheese. Don't quote me on this one, but I remember reading somewhere that some types of sauce work better with certain pasta shapes.\n\n\nMy two suppositions:\n-contact with air/knives might induce chemical reactions in your food that slightly alter the taste.\n-the sensation of taste is influenced by the shape and texture of the food, not just by taste itself.",

It isn't as bitter as other fruits, but it is still more bitter than the inside of the apple.\n\nI'd assume that you take bites of apple slices sideways, meaning that you get the inside as the first taste on your tongue.

Aromatic compounds such as polyphenols mostly contribute to the taste (they also give apples their color), and the enzymatic action on the polyphenols alters the taste. \n\n",

            "Short term, rapid oxidation from increased surface area.  This sounds fancy but I don't have any sources, this would be my guess and upon a quick Google seems to be the prevailing idea.\n\nI'm not sure if someone has identified the chemical change that is responsible if there is one. It could  be and probably is  as simple as more of the juicy area is exposed compared to skin relative to what a typical bite would be. ",
            "I don't know why, but it's true, I also can't finish a whole apple if I don't slice it.\n\nAlso, why does pizza and burgers taste better when you use your hands, instead for a knife and fork, it's the same food isn't it?",

            "To me it's an easier way to *eat* an apple, albeit less convenient to prepare. There's also the lack of concern when you eat it, you're not getting seeds in there, no sir. Additionally there's a better skin to flesh ratio; moreover the ratio stays consistent.",

            "Lawyer here (in England)!  This comment will probably get swallowed up, but the fundamental reason this won\u2019t be possible is cause contract law does not actually stop criminal law from continuing to apply. Contract law is a form of \u201cprivate law\u201d, meaning that when people enter a contract they create legal obligations to act or not act in certain ways to each other. But criminal law is a whole other kettle of fish. It\u2019s a form of public law, meaning it applies to everyone generally in society. So if the statute books say it\u2019s a crime to maim/kill another person, you can\u2019t just contract out of that crime with another person. Looking at it another way, that contract is an agreement with that one person, it doesn\u2019t invalidate your obligations to society as a whole. \n\nIn fact that\u2019s why in the UK when you get brought to court for committing a crime, the case is named \u201cR v [defendant]\u201d. R means Regina, aka the Queen. Criminal law means you\u2019ve broken a legal rule against the state (or society itself) and that\u2019s why your opponent in court is literally the Queen. Contract law means you\u2019ve just broken a private rule you\u2019ve created with another person. \n\nHappy to explain more about how criminal/contract law interacts if anyone is interested!",

            "No - you can\u2019t write a civil contract that overrides criminal charges\n\nIf the question is asking could you write a contract that prevents one from suing the other then yes you totally could, you can basically waive everything in civil courts. The problem with that is the state has a vested interest in not allowing people to uh, assault each other with deadly weapons so there\u2019s no way they wouldn\u2019t prosecute. \n\nIf the assumption is that no one would ever find out about it so criminal charges could be avoided, then there\u2019s really no point in coming up with a contract as all that would do is make a paper trail of your criminal activity. If one person brought the matter up in civil court despite the duel itself not being known to anyone, that would effectively nullify hiding the duel as there\u2019s now a record of the event, and the parties could be prosecuted criminally.\n\nEdit: think of it this way. If two people agree to exchange money, that\u2019s a civil matter and basically just a purchase. But you couldn\u2019t create a contract where the money was exchanged for like, a kilo of cocaine, and that make it legal. The act itself is criminal.

Others, like murder, cannot be consented to unless the law specifically allows it (like states that allow dueling). For states that allow it, you don't need a skilled lawyer, just a clear contract with witnesses (preferably a public notary) expressing consent. \n\nThe degrees of murder are based on the degree of intent (pre-meditated is the highest, intentional is lower, etc.) So a lawyer could definitely make things worse with a contract (by showing premeditation), but it's hard to imagine making things better.",

            "For me personally, it's because of the lack of a \"-teen\" in the number. \n\nI was born in the 80s, so up until the millennium I'd always experienced a \"-teen\" in the year. That became familiar. The year 2000 sounded ***so*** futiristic to my ears due to the giant-sounding \"thousand\" plus lack of \"-teen\", and I continued experiencing a subconscious amazement at [current year] right up until 2009.\n\nOnce \"twenty-ten\" came around, I think it wore off a bit. Either because I was used to it or because 20 obviously sounds smaller than 2000. Then when we hit 2013, I was back to hearing that bloody \"-teen\" again so I stopped thinking about it.\n\nNow that 2020 is approaching, I'm starting to feel that amazement again purely because I'm likely never going to live in another year with \"-teen\" in it. It sounds so futuristic and kind of fucks with my head. 2023 sounds like the year some of the sci-fi I watched as a kid took place in. 2056 just sounds mind-bogglingly far away and yet I'll (hopefully) experience that. 2079 just doesn't even compute in my head as being a realistic year, but my kid is going to be an old man by then and I may have grandkids partying like it's 2099.\n\nI'd like to think my great grandchild will have the same odd relationship with the [current year] sounding weird or different like I do, but it's interesting to me that they'll never have the *exact* same relationship due to their [current year] always starting with the word \"twenty\".",

There's tons of flying cars already in development that have shown a lot of progress, we already are building giant fancy skyscrapers, and you probably know of the plans to live on mars and the space hotels, we really aren't too far if you think about it. \n\nI want to ask you something. Take a long look at everything around you, and I mean everything. Compare everything to how it was in the 1800's or something. I believe that we already are living in the future. \n\nAs we approach the future, the expectations for the future begin to rise up, so we don't even know we're already living in it.\nOf course, with that being said, once we have flying cars everywhere, most likely we will think of the future as galactic conquest or something, where we travel across planets like we travel across countries. \n\nThat's my theory, anyways.

He used to stay up later than me watching TV at night, and and the light shining into my room was always comforting to me as I was falling asleep. I always felt that, even though we weren\u2019t really friends, there was some kind of connection between us, some kind of unspoken bond in both of us being awake at that hour. When he became a teenager and started closing his bedroom door at night, I used to sneak down the hall to see if the light was still shining under the crack in his door. It wasn\u2019t until later, when he moved out, that I closed my door, too.",

Whenever it's nighttime and there's a light on I always feel super uncomfortable because it feels like there might be someone outside the window watching me that I can't see. Having a light on in another room also kinda weirds me out because it makes it feel like there's someone with me in my house I don't know that I can't see or hear.

She lived alone and was afraid of the dark, so in the evening she would pull every blind on every window, then turn on night lights in every room. The entire house had a soft glow. Getting up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night was terrifying because of all those night lights. \n\nBut in our own home, no one likes to shut the living room lights and climb the stairs in the dark.

            "It's a bit more complicated than loneliness, but it does relate to it. We're actually all paranoid.\n\nEveryone in my family is nearsighted and colorblind. I wear glasses for full vision correction, but I don't really trust my eyes to assemble a complete picture in an instant, especially when they're working off partial data. If the light in the next room is off and the door is open, that means there's a part of my field of vision that isn't getting a full picture. And the eye wants a full picture. Otherwise it'll start inventing its own. Next thing you know, you're jumping because the hat rack with your coat on it looks like someone just crept silently through the door.\n\nSo I'll turn on whatever lights I have to, to complete the picture. My parents always left the bathroom and hallway lights on when we went to bed, presumably so we wouldn't have to grope for them in the dark.\n\nMy roommate is the exact opposite. I can only assume his notably strict father trained him to turn off lights at gunpoint, because the zeal with which he will travel from room to room darkening the apartment is impressive. He won't even turn on the lights in the room he's in. He can't walk past a light switch without turning it off. He's turned off the lights in rooms I'm using and turned off the lights on the stairs while I was coming down. Now that I've replaced all the bulbs with LEDs, running every light in the apartment 24 hours a day probably costs less than our minimum electric bill payment, but he's still killing the lights every time he gets up. (Meanwhile, we both have multiple workstations running 24/7.) I know that when we were kids, a 60-watt bulb burned more energy than a diesel locomotive, but the times, they are a-changing.",
            "Sometimes I walk around the house in the dark, and when I don't get attacked by spooky creatures of the night I tell myself it's because they're afraid of me",
            "Yep. I have night lights all over the place. I've got CPTSD and have bad dreams almost nightly, a lot of it stemming from being stalked for two years. There's always a light on even if it's just a night light. When I'm having bad weeks (or months, as the case is right now) I'll leave a lamp on in my basement living room (my bedroom is downstairs) and the bathroom light on too. The night light in my bedroom is bright enough that it keeps me up so I sleep with an eye mask. I feel less terrible about leaving lights on since switching to LED bulbs.\n\nThe frustrating thing is, I don't have as many problems if I'm living in the third floor of a building or higher. I'm okay with having lights off because I feel safer. I do not feel safe living in a house at ground level. It's all from trauma from being stalked. It's going to take a lot of effort for an average person to climb a secure entry building to get to my balcony and no one can see me unless I'm standing at the window. In a house? All they need to do is break a window and I HAVE to have windows covered by curtains so no one can see in. I am deeply uncomfortable being in a room with a window after dark unless the window is completely covered (and blinds don't count because there are gaps).\n\nYay PTSD!",

It helps decompress at the end of the day. I've also had some of my greatest epiphanies for problems at work at times like this. Dribbling is far better than other, more destructive options I've seen for decompressing; drinking, drugs, abuse, etc.\n\nAt a deeper level, be sure to keep an eye on your dad's mental health.

Think of trying to bump a beach ball up some stairs. Unless you can get under the center of gravity of the ball and get some lift, the ball will just bounce of the stair riser. But if the step is half the height or less of the ball, it's possible for it to just roll over the barrier through momentum.\n\n When you sweep, the dust is doing something similar. It's bouncing and bumping along, impelled by the broom bristles. Any particle that gets some lift will make it into the pan.\n\nBut an edge that thin is very sharp knife territory as far as thickness is concerned. And few people would want a razor sharp edge on a dust pan. Second, it has become common for dust pans to have a rubber edge so it can conform to imperfections in the floor better.

            "Ok, here's the deal. Dustpans are super simple to produce. They're just plastic formed into a special shape with a rubber strip thrown on the end. They probably cost 30 cents each to make and then get sold for a few dollars at the store, or included with a broom.\n\nIs it possible? Maybe. Who knows what kinds of electronics or batteries it would need for a super dustpan combo, because it hasn't been done yet. Why? Because all of those things add an enormous amount of cost to what is normally a super low cost item. Not only to produce, but also the price it would have to be sold for in store as well. And then you have to consider the efficiency of each. A regular dustpan might get 99.5% of dirt, and this new one can get 99.9% of the dirt. But is the 0.04% dirt worth the increase in price? You can produce a 99.5% dustpan for 30 cents, or you can produce a 99.9% dustpan for $23. There will be a limited market of buyers who would want to spend that much on something that's only 0.04% better.\n\nSo could we do it, maybe, but it's never been done because it would be extremely expensive with arguably minor impact that most people wouldn't consider being worth the higher cost.\n\ntldr; money and nobody would buy it",

Always makes me think of calculating derivatives (especially that for f(x) = x^2 , which you can depict graphically with a square diagram, maybe you've seen it: for the derivative at x, you have a square with sides of length x, and then increase along two perpendicular lengths by \"infinitesimal\" dx, to create a new square of lengths x+dx. Then you see how the dxdx corner there is relatively negligible in the difference between these two squares' areas, compared to the two rectangles each of area xdx, combining for a total of 2xdx. That makes sense because the derivative of that function is in fact 2x, and you can see how this shakes out directly from the limit definition of the derivative applied to f there too.)",

Nick's parents were better off and similar to this story had a detached garage with a heater in it. I had only been to Nick's house a few times but knew the side door to the garage was always left unlocked and that his parents parked in front of the garage not in it. On cold nights I would walk about 2 miles to get to Nick's house and sleep in the garage. One morning his dad needed a tool from the garage and opened it to find me sleeping on the floor by their heater. I hadn't spoken much to him at that point. Just hellos and goodbyes . He offered to let me sleep on the couch and then from there gave me a key to the place in the stipulation that if I ever needed a place to sleep it was available.

            "I have been on Reddit for years now and for what ever reason this post unlocked a part of my memory. I had a pretty shit childhood. Highschool was the worst of it. Physical and verbal abuse. I was a social pariah. We had a new kid move to my hometown. Small town. I had zero friends at that point. Mostly self inflicted stupidity on my part. I was pretty close to ending everything. We became friends. It never occurred to me until I read this post and the responses that this kids parents saved my life. They took me in. Fed me. Treated me like a son. Clothes, food, money. I spent almost every night there. My parents never cared. I hardly ever checked in. \n\nMy point is this. That kid may be hanging on by a thread and looking for that one life line in the middle of a sea of darkness. I never knew I was thrown that life line. I feel stupid 30 years later for never seeing it.",
            "My parents took a few of my sister and I's friends in over the years. That kid had no choice but to sneak into the only safe place they could find. If this happened to me, I would immediately let them know they have a safe place to stay at my house any time and get them into a warm bed. They're a kid. They can't support themselves and some parents aren't capable of taking care of other people. \n\nThe difference you could make to this kid could mean that they have a safe place to finish high school instead of being homeless, dropping out to work or worse.

            "After reading a handful of comments, something occurred to me: \n\nOP, if you're serious about making a safe space for this kid, how about giving him a code he can text ***to you*** that means he needs a safe place to sleep that night ***with no questions asked?***\n\nIf you respect the part about \"no questions asked\" a few times, I'll bet he'll open up without being asked. \n\nThe important thing is that he knows he doesn't have to stay in an unsafe situation, that he can find safety - both physical and emotional. If he's someone you're willing to go a little further for, and it's possible, you can also give him some sort of code saying \"I need help\" and you'll come get him. That may not be an option for you, but my little heart is breaking for the kid right now...\n\nThe thing you always need to remember about kids is that they don't have the emotional vocabulary to tell you what they need. They're not trying to hold back, they just don't have a way to express what's going on. \n\nThe more you can open the door for them, without pressure, the more they can crawl towards disclosure. Don't ask questions, beyond the necessary ones, but you can offer observations, like, \"it seems like you're going through some things right now. I won't tell my kid <or your parents> about whatever you tell me, but I'm here if you want to talk. No pressure, I won't ask you, but here's a code that means 'I need you to listen without talking' and I promise to respect that.\"\n\nIt's a lot. If you're already stretched too far, that's fine. That's honest and very valid. But just giving the kid a code so you can unlock the garage would at least reduce the expense of fixing the lock...",

But only if your kid wants to. \n\nMy partner had a rough family life growing up. Abuse, alcohol, they did everything possible not to be home. They had some friends whose parents knew things weren't good at home (though not the full extent) and without asking questions made them feel welcome in their home and safe adults they could go to. And it really made all the difference. A place to get a meal, a safe place to sleep after an explosive conflict, an adult to ask how they are doing, cheer them on for doing great on a test, notice that they have a cold, ask about their plans after graduation. \n\nNow, my partner wasn't the perfect teen. They drank and smoked, they definitely were dabbling in petty crime and it could have gone a very different way. But they got out of their house after high school, went to college, and now are an upstanding member of society. So even if this kid smokes or drinks or does stuff that doesn't seem like a \"good influence\" to you, be aware that kids in rough environments often turn to alcohol and drugs to cope with what they are living through. \n\nI was a high school teacher, and I tried to be a safe adult to my students, but I had 120 a day, so it was hard to catch all the people who were having a hard time who needed someone to notice.

I then told the teen that I was willing to listen if they wanted to talk but the best person to talk to was probably their school counselor or another therapist as well as making good effort to try to work things out at home.

You can work with their social workers to come up with a plan to get them into foster or kin care.",

His dad would call after like 3 days pissed asking where he was but once he told my place he backed off. He would spend as much time as possible at our place and my parents never complained. When we got older mid 20's I asked my mom and all she said was he was a good kid in a shit situation and if I could give him just a day or two of relaxing away from it all she was happy todo it. He ended up in the marines to grt out and when he got back apparently he went to my parents to thank them for what they did. (I was at work) and frankly broke my mother's heart but was happy he's doing better. He now has 2 kids on his own and is an amazing father",

            "How awesome you created a house that's a safe place. What an honor that this distressed person chose you. Well done, fellow parent.\n\nConsider carefully what this young person needs. A key may be one need. A trusted adult ear may be another need. Don't force anything, but consider how you can demonstrate a safe, caring, trustworthy love this person clearly needs. It's a tall responsibility.",
            "I hope your kids reach out to him.  My home life sucked when I was in my teens.  I found myself homeless at 16 for a few weeks.  Luckily I had a good group of friends with good parents that helped keep me out of trouble.  Help if you can help, there's a lot of kids that need support when they can't get it from their own family.",
            "As someone who was more or less in the same boat a few times as a kid, if they're a good friend of your kid, elaborate on the \"don't make a habit of it\" comment. They may take that as don't come around when you don't have a place to go, you know? I read what your husband meant by it, but just make sure the kid knows. You seem like good folks.",

            "I was made homeless at 17. I'm now 37.\n\nLooking back, I was desperate for anyone to help me. I had no idea how the world worked or how I could get help. I ended up sleeping on the streets for a year before I eventually began sofa surfing.\n\nMy advice: you have kids. This kid is not your responsibility and you have to put your own childrens wellfare first. However, if you want to help change this kids life for the better, try to find local services that can help keep them warm, dry and fed.\n\nI think if I'd had just one person early on offer to help me, I wouldn't have ended up wasting 10 years of my life.",

Nothing wrong with having him over more and helping him out some if you can.\n\nThe fact that he slept in the garage and didn\u2019t tell anyone what he was doing probably means he\u2019s self-conscious about it and doesn\u2019t want to inconvenience y\u2019all so just be patient with him. Seems like he has it rough",
            "You mention that they are a teen, but that could be age 13 as well as age 17. I based my answer here on the presumption that they are closer to the younger years of a teen. Things aren\u2019t right at home. Or in the very least\u2026in his mind about home. Which wouldn\u2019t be much difference. He\u2019s likely embarrassed b/c he hasn\u2019t opened up to someone he considers his friend about anything. Yet, he ironically finds this friend to be the closets person to him if he picked his residence for safety/comfort. There are red flags here so red that they are blazing with flames. I would suggest turning on that \u201cmotherly\u201d charm (maybe making some cookies or something\u2026what do I know I\u2019m a guy, sorry) and try sitting with him one on one. He may find it easier to open up to you than your husband and/or with your husband and kids presence. If you\u2019re not able to get anywhere\u2026I\u2019d contact someone that deals with these things. I wouldn\u2019t send him back home, because there\u2019s no guarantee that he would go there. He may just end up wandering the streets and trespassing hiding spots to find sleeping places (and you know how that would end up working out). At the same time you are now responsible if he\u2019s in your supervision. You have to ask yourself why any suitable parent(s) wouldn\u2019t be searching the town looking for their teen kid during the wee hours of the morning. Please protect\u2026they are subconsciously reaching out for your help when they chose YOUR garage. If they are in fact more like 17 or older then you can skip the cookies lol and have your son handle it peer to peer but put pressure on your son to have him open up about what\u2019s needed to help him prosper. Your son can communicate that his parents are able and willing to help but they (and he) need to understand what\u2019s going on. He should then understand that he has someone that cares and has options. Hope for the best.",
            "Sounds like it is one but still it needs to be solidly confirmed. \n\nHere is why it is pretty suspicious:\n\n1. A teenager ran away from home. Our homes is where we are ourselves. We can get fully naked there, half naked there, or wear the clothes of the opposite sexuality, anything. If a child runs away from his/her home, it is probably because he/she doesn't feel safe there. Infact so unsafe that he/she will risk the full exposure of the raw world than get back to their biological parents' or foster parents' home. Usually, such children will find a home in a bad place. I am wandering off so i will stop my this specific point now.\n\n\n2. He/She is avoiding talking about his/her home life. I fairly strongly suspect he/she took this route to distance himself/herself from neglect/abuse from his/her biological parents or foster parents.",
