        "selftext": "I was born in Vietnam and moved to the US when I was 23. I had some girls interested in me during college (in Vietnam) but we never made a move because you know, it's Vietnam and it's the cultural thing back then. Then I moved to the US. Haven't found anyone since. There's so few asian in my city let alone Vietnamese. My college is full of white and latins (demographics). Don't get me wrong I don't mind dating out of my race but college folks here seem to keep to themselves, even men. I made some friends but as soon as semester ends they all go their own path. Some even deleted my number and ignored me. And it seems like all women are taken. In the end maybe it's because I'm not good looking (short, dark skin, average looking face). I also have moderate depression & anxiety. \n\n\nThen people made fun of me when they knew I'm a virgin. Even my relatives laughed behind my back too.\n\nI made a post in a tech subreddit. Not only people didn't answer my question, but also they stalked my profile and made fun of me being a virgin. \n\nI know it might not be a big deal. But I felt so down after that. I felt like I should commit a suicide for being a useless loser in this world... \n\nDo I have hobbies? Yes, but most of them don't involve interactions with people. I keep a big fish tank and I love them. I play video games too. I've been rescuing stray dogs since I moved here. I used to volunteer at my local shelter but since I adopted my dog here and got busy with school I volunteer much less nowadays...\n\n**Thanks everyone for being so supportive. I can't reply to you all but I do read & appreciate your advice.\n\n** And thanks for the awards but I feel I didn't deserve because I don't know how to use them :D",

            "Our society\u2019s perception of sex and virginity is extremely overvalued. Do NOT feel the slightest bit ashamed of it. Embrace it. Seriously, nobody needs to care or know that kind of information.",
            "Virgin till 27 right here bro, 29 this year, married a few months ago. You're fine, I never even went on a date before last year. Everyone moves at their own speed for their own reasons.",
            "everyone moves at their own pace. you\u2019re perfectly fine.",
            "Nah bro who gives a fuck, they are only joking about you because they are insecure about themselves.",
            "Personally I would say no. I'm a 31 year old virgin.\n\nI know what you mean, it's not something people want to be known as but it is what is. I think it's much better than being a divorced deadbeat dad with kids you never really wanted.\n\nEdit: It's most likely got something to do with the fact that I have high functioning autism and I never had particularly great social skills. And I was never interested in having sex with some random person purely for the sake of losing my virginity.",
            "This is something you have to shake up your mind by yourself. We all can say every encouraging words but it will not work until you stop bothering with those judgement and be carefree. There is no such thing that you have to have sex before 20, you have to be successful before 30, or you have to have kids to be fulfillment in your life. People has different terms in life and they just use their measurements in yours. Stay away from toxic, mate.",
            "What the fuck why would people on a tech subreddit instead of answering a question, stalk your profile to call you a loser? I think they are the losers here really.",
            "You\u2019re not a loser for being a Virgin. Maybe you should see a therapist or a professional who can help you with suicidal ideation and work with you on your confidence. If you want, you\u2019ll find someone to be with.",
            "People put way too much stock into their virginity.  It honestly doesn't matter asong as you enjoy your life. If you want to change that change it, but don't feel down and don't worry about the fact that people are immature and stupid.",
            "Nope. I'm 27. Also a virgin. I guess for me it's a little different because I consider myself somewhat asexual, so I don't really have much of a desire to have sex, at least not at this point in my life. Maybe in the future. But the point is, your sexual life doesn't determine your success and happiness in life. Or at least it shouldn't. There's so much more to life besides it. Find a fulfilling job. Gain hobbies. Spend time with family and friends. Travel somewhere. Get into a great TV show, game, or book. Those things can all make you feel happy and fulfilled and not worthless.",
            "You're not a loser. Virginity is s social construct that bears no real value. You'll never get denied a job, raise, loan, etc for being a virgin. If you need to take things slow, then that's how you are. There is no reason to feel bad about it.",

            "I think you'll be ok. I was a virgin until I was 30. I had all but given up on ever finding someone and then surprise! I met my boyfriend.\n\nOne thing though - when you find someone, don't feel obligated to have sex before you're ready. If they truly respect you, they'll be patient and help you feel confident and comfortable. I was so worried about my inexperience when I met my boyfriend, especially because he's older, but he was okay with it and was patient. Don't be afraid to step out of your comfort zone, but don't feel like you should be doing everything as soon as possible.\n\nBest of luck! \ud83d\ude0a",

You cannot control how other people define you.\n\nHowever, I only admit to never having had sex using a throwaway.  Not sure what possible up side to admitting it publicly could be.",
            "Anyone who gives a fuck about that isn't worth giving a fuck about honestly. If you're a good dude your sex life should matter to literally no one. I don't go around asking people how much sex they're having because it doesn't affect me and I literally could not give less of a shit about how much or how little they're having.",
            "First of all, fuck them, second of all, you're totally fine. Some people are virgins for life, one reason or another. No need to feel insecure about it though. No one really should. And plus, don't waste your virginity on someone you don't actually love. Just, wait until you find the right one. If you do waste it, I've heard that it's very regrettable. So, your fine really.",
            "I was a virgin until 28. I'm now 35, and I've made up for lost time. It's not the end of the world. Maybe look into why you're still a virgin though, if you want to change it. Anxiety? That was and is my biggest issue. I don't know if it's the same for you, but if you want to change, try reflecting on what's causing it. If you can afford it, therapy would help a lot.",
            "Hey! No you're not a loser. Some people move more quickly than others, and then there are the others, and that's okay. You'll get there. And it doesn't even mean anything anyway. It's just an idea people use to make themselves seem better than others because they're scared of what people think of them. \n\nYou will find someone who will accept you for the person you truly are. You just have to put yourself out there. Go at your own pace.\n\nAs for the suicidality, I've been there and it's really hard to find a reason not to do it sometimes. BUT you can get better. Find a trusty therapist that won't judge you. Some will, you might have to undergo some trial and error before you find the right one for you. That will feel discouraging but you've got it, just keep trying. \n\nFind a hobby, something you love to do, like drawing, making music, writing, reading, volunteering, or learning about something you're really interested in. If you're employed, dive into your job. Distract yourself. \n\nMost importantly, realize your value as a person. \n\nFeel free to PM me if you need to talk. You've got this.",
            "Definitely definitely not!\n\nThere's this strange obsession in society that says everyone has to be sexually active and yadah-yadah-yadah.\n\nTake your time! Go at your own flow.",
            "Bro your sex life is your own business. Nobody should even care what you do in the bedroom. I certainly don't care.",
            "Nope. Not IMO anyhow. Would you consider the opposite sex a  loser for the same thing?  No matter the answers you get, it stands to reason that those that are saying No are telling you their truth, as are those saying Yes.  Neither answer is right or wrong. They\u2019re all just opinions, and we know everyone has one. That\u2019s why I ask you your opinion if it\u2019s going the other way. That, to me, is where you find YOUR answer.\n\nSuicide is never the answer to virginity. That seems rather counterproductive, wouldn\u2019t you agree?  All those assholes making fun of you are just that - assholes insecure in their own sexuality. I\u2019ll bet you that the ones that made fun of you are not exactly killing it in the bedroom.  When people make fun of you, Always consider the source. \ud83d\ude09. Coming from a woman, when I was single, a 27 virgin male was the Holy Grail.  I don\u2019t assume your gender as you didn\u2019t specify, I\u2019m only speaking from my own perspective.",

            "Honestly dude, once a woman comes into your life, you will have a lot less time to do things that can get you ahead in life. Enjoy your time. Sex is the least of your worries. Setting yourself up for a simple and enjoyable future, is where it's at in my opinion. Just focusing on becoming your best version of yourself and the right person will eventually come along.",
            "I didn't have sex until I was 36. And I sure ain't a loser.",
            "The way I look at it is that no one in this world has shared their body with you and that\u2019s pretty damn special. I\u2019m sure it would mean a lot to the other person when and if you choose to lose your virginity.",

Try not to listen to these negative people. I\u2019d wager they\u2019re just tearing you down to feel better about themselves.\n\nPlease find someone you can trust to talk openly to if you\u2019re considering suicide. If you can\u2019t find someone soon call 1-800-273-8255. I hope this helps friend sending love.",
            "No, no, no, no. Definitely no. If you haven't found the person you'd be completely comfortable having sex with, people shouldn't pressure you to \"just get it over with\", or make fun of you. No. Zero tolerance to those people. The moment you do it, if you decide to, will be the perfect moment, and you'll be glad you didn't do it before just out of peer pressure.",
            "Nah man. Your first time will probably be pretty monumental to you, but for the time being it really isn't worth losing asleep over. It gets old quickly, just like anything else. You should instead focus on yourself (I understand how cliche this sounds, but it isn't wrong.) By furthering yourself and displaying focus on your own pursuits, you may find the sex just finds you one day.",
            "No. you just need to find the right person. Quality over Quantity, dude.",
            "No, you're no loser for that...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor me as a woman it's strange that men tend to define themselves over their sexual experiences that much. For (I guess) 90 % of women it doesn't really matter, especially if girls already were interested in you (so they liked something about you). Also, having many partners means a higher risk for diseases.\n\nFor most people it's really hard to find someone where it \"clicks\". Everyone is just not made for everyone. I'd say I meet someone I'm interested in approximately every 10 years (I'm 32 now)...  I think this idea of having a hot flirt every other month is really more an illusion than norm. At least for me. Life of most people is not full of flirts, sex and romanticism as suggested by movies, porn, stories, press and social media. And those people that have it going on might be quite superficial, I suspect.\n\nStudies also show that men in general more often tend to be unhappy with their love life in their twenties. It gets better in the thirties ;)\n\nFor women it's often the other way round (yay, great outlook).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also want to comment on your percieved shortcomings. Some girls prefer this, some girls prefer the exact opposite. Preferences often change over a lifetime or options get added. It's not set in stone. There are also many girls that are dating men they like because of attractiveness in character traits or common interests, not preferences in looks. A man can be cool despite not looking perfect.\n\n\\- Dark skin: This is a good thing, right? At least where I come from...\n\n\\- Average looking face: Preferences of women differ wildly, believe me.\n\n\\- Short height: While it is true that SOME girls like tall guys (or at least taller than themselves), there are many girls (including myself) that like or even prefer shorter guys (even shorter than themselves o.k., which more often seems to be a no-go for men). Just try to find your confidence, that it the most important part!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJudging from your text and interests you sound like a cool and serious (in a positive way) guy.\n\nMy advice would be:\n\n\\- Move to a town/city with a bigger asian community, if you feel comfortable there. Preferences also often differ regionally (e.g. when I go to a town 40 km outside of the city, people are suddenly more interested), so just change places as soon as possible if you are not happy where you live.\n\n\\- Emerge in hobbies, that keep your mind busy and are meaningful (e.g. learning something new, maybe an instrument, a language, etc.). Reactivate your old, meaningful hobbies (volunteering etc.). While you have no partner, use your time for the right things and try to waste as little as possible on the wrong things.\n\n\\- Keep your body clean and healthy: Shower & deodorant, clean teeth (see dentist/orthodontist regularly), shave, no smoking, do a bit cardio, reduce overweight if you have, dress to your advantage, keep a good haircut.\n\n\\- Against loneliness: Listening to audio books is a big help for me. Hearing a human voice talking to me just makes me feel better. I listen to the same books over and over again. I would not choose thrillers, better something positive (Harry Potter etc.). Also having a pet ist great, but you already have that :)\n\n\\- Limit your contact with people (also relatives) that make fun of you to necessities. It indicates bad character to make fun of someone who tells private information he is concered about. Sexual (in)experience is a very private and sensitive topic, don't talk about it with people you can't trust 100 %.\n\n\\- If you feel you can't cope with your depression anymore, seek professional help. I have also been there, there's no shame in that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope any of this helps!\n\nBest wishes from Europe",

            "Newton died a virgin. Is he a loser?\n\nYou know what though, your definition of being a loser is up to you. You define being a loser as someone who didn't have sex for all your life, that's on you. But I think you're strong. You could have paid for sex for any day for almost a decade now, but you didn't. That's something other people can't do. You could've raped people. But you didn't. Being a rapist us my definition of being a loser, and hey, you aren't a loser in my book.",
            "You ever hear the phrase, \"He needs to get laid\"? Well, unfortunately, getting laid doesn't magically solve problems. Being a virgin is also an imaginary problem. It'll happen when it happens and don't expect life to magically change after losing it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, suicide is nothing to toy around with. You absolutely should speak to someone in person about it. Don't get trapped in your mind, we believe in you.",
            "I'm a bit younger, but I'm also a virgin, when the majority of my friends at college aren't (I say majority cuz I'm not sure about a few of them), but they definitely look at me differently because of it.  \n\nI don't know your situation so I won't try to make assumptions about it, but it sounds like you need a group of friends who you can really connect with who won't care about the \"problems\" you have, but care about YOU.  Of course you may have friends like this, I don't know, but if you want to talk to me I'm always ready to see if I can help out :) (now I'm not a trained mental health professional but I do have experience with depression, anxiety, and eating disorders)",
            "Look, man. Sex is over rated. It does not define your success. Strive to become the best version of yourself and things will eventually fall into place. I believe that you are a very capable and smart person and that big things are waiting for you! \nI am asexual so I went through the whole \"I may need sex to be accepted\" thing, but seeing that life is so much better without it, it just opened my eyes. \nStay safe xx",
            "You\u2019re worthy of happiness. A relationship does not define you. Whether of not you\u2019ve had sex does not define you. \n\nFind joy in the things you like to do. Reading, gaming, cooking, gardening, whatever they may be.\n\nNot everyone had a high sex drive. Some people have no sex drive. Whatever. There\u2019s more to life than sex. No shame in that.",
            "If you hadn't told me,I wouldnt know you were a virgin. I honestly dont care either way and I think a lot of people would feel the same as me. You dont know about my sex life and yours is no ones business. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

            "\"Virginity\" is a very personal and cultural value, nobody is a loser if they lose it in 18 or 38 or die with it. Nobody can judge you for your personal decisions, you must not judge yourself, too.\n\nIt's a personal value; you may not want to lay down with just anyone that is interested in you and \"keep\" your first time or your body for your special one. You may even want to keep your first kiss, not waste it on some drunk party girl/boy. (In rare circumstances) You may just not like to have sex for fun (believe me I've seen it).\n\nIt's also a cultural thing; in some states of my country \"having sex\" is not something you do for fun, it's just a means to give birth and it must happen after marriage for having children only. If you have sex with someone, you must marry him/her. I know that in some extreme cultures they kill people because they lost their virginity before marriage. So it completely depends on the environment you have grown up in.\n\nDon't feel anything bad about it but also don't make it a taboo. You will know when the time comes. Just have fun and live your life the way you like and value.",
            "Nah. It\u2019s a dumb \u201crite of passage\u201d that people are, a lot of the times, peer pressured into because they don\u2019t want to feel ashamed. Society has made sex into such a *big fucking deal* when really...it\u2019s not. Having had sex doesn\u2019t define you as a person. You don\u2019t level up and transform into some new and better person. In the end it really doesn\u2019t matter. You don\u2019t get a medal if you have sex. No one can prove you did or didn\u2019t have sex. \n\nYou already know you need to find hobbies wherein you interact with women in person.",
            "No, you\u2019re valuable because you are you, not because of something you do or the person you may be with.\n\nSex is wonderful, but if it isn\u2019t with a good person of character and solid mental health it can lead to a disastrous relationship. Or it can be meaningless when done without a relationship leaving you empty and wanting more (yet always lacking if there is no relationship).\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled by what society or TV or loud people think. The truth is that sex has to be in a relationship that is safe and quality FIRST or it will become something that distracts you from clear thinking. \n\nRemember that you want someone in your life who makes it better or adds to it. This isn\u2019t something that is easy to build or learn. Your life can be great without sex, and adding another person has to be something worthwhile. The last thing we want is to have someone, have sex, but have that person be a drain or burden. \n\nI don\u2019t believe in sex without relationships, because it\u2019s like ordering a meal with no calories. It deceives into thinking you are full, but only leaves you with a desire for something substantial and enduring.",
            "I'm going to give a slightly different answer than everyone else here. You're not a loser because you're a virgin at 27 years old, but you *could* be a virgin at 27 years old because you're a loser. \n\nWhat I mean by that is because it seems like you're placing a lot of value in losing your virginity. So you have to ask yourself - why haven't you lost it yet? If it's because you haven't been prioritizing it, or you're waiting for the right person, or because you're not a very sexual person, then those are all completely valid reasons and I wouldn't worry about it. However, if you're blaming the fact that you're a virgin on \"the world being against you\" or \"people are so superficial and ignore you\" then you have a terrible mindset and are kind of a loser and you need to stop being a loser.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that you have to take a step back and think about who you are and what you value. Be confident, you can and will grow as a person, and suicide isn't the answer.",
            "People here jump right in to calm you down and shit, but the reality is it depends on how you define yourself - if it's a big thing for you and you put effort in trying to get a partner and you can't, then yes you can be called loser.  \n\nBut if you don't really care, and just not doing a lot in that department.. well how would you react if they thought you're a loser for not being able to play piano? something like \"pffffft ofcourse i can't, no big deal, i never was interested and never put effort into learning\" i imagine, and that's the right reaction in both cases",
            "Yeah, no one will say it directly towards you, and peoole here only tell you nice things.\n\nBut if youre a virgin at 27 you are a loser. Everyone else would have fucked by then atleast once. If you didnt come across one girl who wanted you, there is something really wrong.",

            "People here sugarcoat the issue a little to much. Rule is essentially: \n\n* sub-20, normal\n* up to around 25, late bloomer, but fine\n* past 25, things starts to get weird\n* past 30, very weird, many woman will see this as red flag\n* past 35, might be time to seek professional help\n\nExceptions apply to very religious people who still go through tons of boyfriends/girlfriends, but just skip on the sex before marriage part.\n\nThat said, you'll probably be fine due to this:\n\n> I had some girls interested in me during college but we never made a move because you know, it's Vietnam and it's the cultural thing. \n\nFor the crowd over in /r/ForeverAlone/, that basically never happened. The thing that matters isn't so much your status as a virgin, but how much and how you interact with woman, the virgin thing is just a side-effect.",

            "I'm about to explain a lot of stuff that we should not have to explain, but still have to because sex is a dogma full of weird rituals.\n\n- It's okay to lose your virginity at 17, 27, 37, 67, 87 years old. Waiting longer won't make you worse, and you can ask to so many people about this: having your first time with someone you feel good with (not necessarily in love with but at least comfortable  enough to share that) is pretty much a necessary if you don't want to regret it later. Taking your time and admitting it might not be as good as you hope is a good way to see it too.\n\n- It's okay to never lose your virginity. Some people don't like sex, some people have been traumatised and don't want to have sex, some other are just not worried with that specifically and won't care if it doesn't happen but would take a chance if it ever tend to happen; and all of this is okay, it doesn't make a loser or a weirdo out of you.\n\nWhile I'm at it, more stuff that everyone should see as obvious but doesn't:\n\n- It's okay to lose your virginity while young (15-16). If you're ready, if you know what you're about to get in, if you and your partner are consenting, and if you do it with someone you trust, that isn't a problem, and don't let any outdated conservative ideologies say otherwise. The same goes about the choice of your parners and how many of them you have.\n\n- Not considering your first time as a special event and a highly important step to become an adult is okay, it's even quite wise, you'll stop worrying about nothing. You can consider your first sexual relation as having as much importance as the first time you got in another country or the first time you ate in a chinese restaurant, and it's alright, just keep in mind that sex doesn't have the same importance for everyone and being out of the standards doesn't make you a loser.\n\n- You're not a loser - because \"loser\" depends of such arbitrary rules like sex, money, happiness, properties, interests, etc. And even if you were one, quite frankly, that is no reason to laugh at you, or at anyone that is a loser.\n\nAnd a last one, for everyone who laughs at you and for people who laugh at peopke for rabdom things in general: mocking someone whom you think to be inferior to or worse than you in any way or another just makes you look like a cunt, not only because you seriously think that you can be better than someone else and that your definition of good and bad is the right one, but because you can't even treat people you see as less than you the right way and you just laugh at them instead of being useful or at least empathetic about them because they are human beings who don't want to be mocked or hatred.",

            "No.\n\nAnd dark skin IS good looking. \n\nBeing short is not the big deal some guys think it is. If you're 5'4\" you're taller than about half the women here, and many women date guys who are shorter than them. Also, having an average looking face is not a problem. Look around you. There are plenty of less-than-average looking people having sex. \n\nWhat gets you laid is having enough confidence to put yourself out there and face the inevitable bouts of rejection and heartbreak that everyone on earth experiences. That, and a good personality. Making someone laugh with your jokes is really all it takes.\n\nThe US and Vietnam have wildly different customs, so learning and adjusting to US dating etiquette is hard. It takes time. Just don't fall for any of that pickup artist or incel stuff. Read Dr. Nerdlove and you'll be fine.\n\nOne piece of advice: If you want to move to a city with more Vietnamese people, there are plenty of cities like that in the US. You don't necessarily need to date Vietnamese women but just remember that you can live wherever you want.\n\nFor your self-esteem, anxiety, and depression I'm going to suggest something weird: weight lifting. You can buy cheap weights and learn routines from YouTube. Exercise really improves mood, and weightlifting results start being pretty visible in about six weeks. It's very fast. Also, you don't have to be muscular to date but it might make you feel more confident.\n\nLast, I just want to say that I hate the word \"virgin.\" I mean, there shouldn't be a label for someone who hasn't had sex before. It's just one thing you haven't experienced yet. It doesn't define you or put you in a category. There's no label for someone who has had sex once vs someone who has had it 100 times. Or someone who had sex last week vs someone who had it last year. It's ridiculous to act like all people who haven't had sex are on one side and all people who have had sex are on another side. Everyone has different experiences.",

This is a conscious choice I have made that I'm proud of despite everyone else's crap they've tried to give me. I have had a girlfriend for the past two years, but I've made the choice to remain a virgin and I'm happy with it. Have people judged me for it? Of course. But I don't care, they can have their own opinions of me but quite honestly their judgements say more about them than about me. Be proud of who you are, and don't give into any pressure. As others have said, the value placed on such unimportant things are way overrated.

You\u2019re saying that your ugly, your taking supplements to become more attractive (supplements aren\u2019t bad, I\u2019d just be cautious around your reasoning), and don\u2019t think women will want you because your Asian. I guarantee there will be people who find you attractive for who you are! If you wish to be with another Asian out of preference that\u2019s okay, but it\u2019s still okay for you to flirt with white women. I know many mixed race couples. Although the end goal of therapy is to work on how you view yourself rather than figure out ways to get with a woman, I DO think that working on your self perception will give you the confidence to put yourself out there. It\u2019s almost a self defeating cycle where you\u2019re insecure so you don\u2019t try. If women can see you\u2019re confident they\u2019ll be attracted to that confidence within you even if you aren\u2019t the absolutely best looking.",

I\u2019m an American [F] with a family that has lived here for multiple generations. When we started dating (he was 28), I was actually the much more forward person that asked him out, and then pounced on him on our first date. It was... awkward... and didn\u2019t go very well.\n\nBut instead of avoiding it, the next day he told me about how he sees Americans approach dating and sex differently than Malaysians and how, while he didn\u2019t not like my advances, was thrown by them and felt unprepared and embarrassed.\n\nAs an American woman that (while being pretty uninhibited about sex) thinks American dating games are lame, I appreciated the hell out of his forwardness about telling me of the cultural and relationship differences. And he even went a step further and didn\u2019t apologize for any of it, mostly telling me I can take his pace or leave it, but that he hoped I\u2019d understand because he liked me.\n\nFive years later and we\u2019re getting married in two months. :)\n\nFWIW, I agree with what others have said about therapy (although I know it\u2019s more accepted in western culture than most Asian cultures), and I\u2019d even go a step further and say that learning to own your culture and history while in a radically different culture is really awesome. Americans don\u2019t always understand how dating works in other countries, and if you prefer to find Vietnamese ladies, then by all means, go for it! But there are going to be American ladies that will appreciate your background too, and honestly, the no-nonsense approach to relationships and sex is a breath of fresh air for some of us.

            "When I was 12 years old my mom's phone rang at 9pm on December 23rd. It was my aunt screaming that my older cousin had committed suicide and she just found his body in his room. My whole family frantically drove over to my aunt's house (I have a very big, close family so we all lived close to each other. Less than a 15min drive). By the time my parents and I got there, all my other family members were parked in the middle of the street, on the sidewalk, on people's lawns. Everyone got there even before the ambulance. We all were in the house crying and mourning literally over my cousin's body. He had OD'd on his anti-psychotic medication and died in his bed; he struggled with severe schizophrenia. When the ambulance and police arrived, we all huddled into my aunt's bedroom while she and a few of my uncles were outside watching my cousin's body be carried out on a stretcher.\n\nWhat got me most was not everything that happened after we got to the house; it was the indescribable wailing of my aunt over the phone. I didn't know a person could emit such sounds.\n\nSo yea. Whenever my phone rings passed 8pm, *especially* if it's a family member, I always have a mild panic attack before answering and can't help but answer with \"What's wrong? is everything ok??\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: spelling and fixing some details",

            "Eh it's more of an anxiety/comfort zone thing. While my dad was still alive I answered the phone for everyone just in case it was some emergency with him. But now that all that has passed, as long as my bills are paid, once I'm off work I don't answer the phone for shit. Friends, family, unknown numbers, fuck 'em. Nothing against them, but my time at work is my time interacting with other humans. Soon as I punch out of work, I punch out of social life, and I don't re-enter social life until I clock in the next morning.",
            "Yes. No one understands my struggle but I cannot use the phone for verbal communication. It\u2019s WAAAY to anxiety-provoking for me. ",
            "I can just about answer my dads calls but I still sigh before I answer lol.\n\nIf everyone in the world can just take 30 or 40 practice calls with me so I can get comfy that'd be greeeeat",
            "Yes, and have done since I was a small child. I have no problem with face-to-face conversation or conversation by text (ie email/text/social media), but I can't seem to handle phones at all and panic whenever my phone rings. Really sucks. ",
            "I have the same thing and I think it\u2019s a direct result of the advent of texting. I\u2019m in my mid-20s so when I got my first phone, it was around that time. As a result I\u2019ve never been a caller; if me and my friends wanted to talk, we texted. All those pre-mid 00s movie scenes I\u2019ve watched where kids have landline phones in their bedrooms and spend hours after school chatting with friends, I never experienced that. Not just phones though, MSN Messenger was a big part of my childhood. Because of this, a situation was ultimately created wherein if my friends and I chose phone calls over texting, it must be urgent. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve actually ever received a phone call that delivered me awful news (or if I have, the number is so few I can\u2019t remember) and yet I think my subconscious still assumes that if I\u2019m getting a phone call, it must be important/grave/etc. That makes me nervous. Add onto that the grating noise of a phone vibrating on a surface and you\u2019ve got a recipe for anxiety.\n\nBut not only those, I think the immediacy of a phone call is unsettling. With texting, I can receive one, think about my reply, maybe leave it a bit if I don\u2019t feel like responding, etc. There\u2019s no pressure, it\u2019s all a very laid back process. With phone calls, however, you have to respond to questions/information right there, right now. \n\nCould be different for others but for me, this is what I\u2019ve figured out is the problem.",
            "I never answer phone calls unless I recognize the name or numbers. Even then I don\u2019t usually answer phone calls unless it\u2019s my bf or mom.  And I don\u2019t return phone calls unless someone leaves a vm or like I said if I recognize them. \n\nToo many scams and unfortunately for me debt collectors that I don\u2019t want to talk to lol I\u2019m not paying shit.  \n\n",
            "Yes. And the treatment for this is exposure therapy. No getting around it.\n\n3... 2... 1... DO IT!!!\n\nThe more you buck up and do it, the less of an issue it becomes over time.\n",
            "I got the call my fears were based on just a few weeks ago when my father passed away. \n\nSo no, I don\u2019t have those irrational fears any longer. Wish I did. ",
            "As a 911 dispatcher, this would be a very bad fear to have. ",
            "Absolutely. I called my physical mailbox \"The Bad News Box\", and my old cell phone was \"The Mini Bad News Box\". ",
            "For me, it's not a fear, more the fact that I just don't like talking to people. If it's someone I don't know and it's important, then they'll leave a message. If they don't leave a message, then it wasn't important and answering would have been useless. If it's someone I know and I don't feel like talking, I won't answer and text back when I feel like it.",
            "A little, for some people they prefer texting way more, for some reason I don't, I don't really like texting, it's like you can't express your tone and stuff correctly with text, so I feel like people are mad at me if they use a period or short answers lol",

I pissed off quite a few friends who at first didn't believe I keep my phone off for most of the day.\nSince it meant I also don't receive texts and such.\nI also didn't want to explain I'm afraid of it ringing.\n\nI kept it this way for a few years. Then I discovered you can still turn on wifi in airplane mode.\n\n\nSince then I go days at a time in airplane mode.\n\nI like it. Who really has to reach me can use email.

Your headset would just ding with no warning and you were live on the line with a caller who was pissed off about this new Windows Vista thing. The stress broke me.\n\nIt got worse as the years went by and gradually progressed into not making calls, not returning texts or IMs either. Then not wanting to go see my friends or anything.

If there was a problem my employees would get another manager to call me when I\u2019m home after work. I would get calls on my days off because someone called in sick and the other manager would just call me instead of trying to call someone else in which is frustrating when I dove an hour to work.  The worst was after I got my wisdom teeth out they called me in not because some one called in sick but basically because the two girls working together didn\u2019t get along, I was so mad. It was part the other managers fault for not trying but also incompetence of the employees that I couldn\u2019t do anything about. It was so bad the only way to avoid my phone was to go out so I would go shopping just to avoid my phone(no cell phone then) things did eventually get better \n\nAlso my ex husband had a gambling problem and got many phone calls from credit collectors. Even after he moved out I would still get calls on my home line. I didn\u2019t want to answer them to get screamed at but to sit there listening to my phone ring 7 time before the answering machine kicks in was torture. \n\nTo this day I\u2019m still have a fear of the phone. My heart roll start to race when I don\u2019t recognize the number. When they don\u2019t leave a message I dismiss it as a scam or telemarketer.

            "Yes and no. When I was little we had a landline with a cord. After watching horror movies my fear and still is even though are no cords any more is being strangled while on the phone. ",
            "Oh my God yes. Making them too. It's been one of my biggest obstacles",
            "Yep, my anxiety is through the roof when the phone rings, and I can forget about actually making a phone call... I hate the phone most days. ",
            "Yup, I get tons of calls every day, lots of them scammers. And I get anxious so fuckin' bad for no reason. And since I'm unemployed, I have to answer the phone because I don't know whether or not it's a potential employer or a scammer. Either way, I'm fucked.\n\nScammers are the fuckin' worst. They play on your anxiety to strongarm you into giving your hard-earned money to some pieces of shit. They even use tactics like, \"We have a warrant for your arrest\", even though if you did, you wouldn't be hearing about it through the phone, you'd be either getting it in your mail through a court summons, or the police shows up at your door themselves.\n\nI hate that so much.",
            "My fear comes from answering a spoofed number.\n\nI'm currently awaiting a call to set up a doctors appointment and accidentally answered a call yesterday from a spoofer.\n\nI've been getting 12 calls an hour now and it's been pissing me off hoping my doctor leaves a voicemail to call him back.",
            "Yes, everyone.",
            "Yes, only because my mom would make me lie to the debt collectors. ",
            "Yes I do. I thought I was the only one, then when people say to call I just get this feeling of dread. It sucks hard.",
            "Yes! And it gets worse over time if I don't start answering. If I pick up the phone then the spell is broken and I can start answering again. But as soon as I ignore it and a day goes by without me answering - I'm screwed. E-mail is fine. Dunno what is with the phone...",
            "Yes, so much yes. But I'm socially anxious, I can speak to people in person just fine, but phone calls make me uncomfortable.",
            "I do, but I force my self to answer. I come from a city where if you wanted to fight someone, you could:\n\nA) call them and tell them to meet you somewhere.\n\nB) Just show up at their house\n\nC) Catch them by surprise in public\n\nObviously I'm talking about when I was younger, like middle school and high school. I have done all three of those methods. And for some reason to this day whenever I get a call from a number I do not know a part of me thinks it's someone who wants to fight me.",
            "Yes, it doesn't help that I work in a call centre \ud83e\udd14",
            "For many years I did not enjoy doing calls at all until I needed to find a job and most recruiters call you not just email to set up things.\n\nThis fear slowly fades away with a couple of serious calls which can cause Major impact on your life.. \n\nSame goes for emails and other simple things, like asking help at a supermarket.. \n\nIt's all about understanding that communication is the key to everything in life and that's it exists for helping us ",
            "I used to. If it's not full-on anxiety, the easiest way to fix it is to work in a job where answering phone calls is common and expected but not all of the job. Within a few weeks I was completely over it and, even though I still don't like talking over the phone when I can't hear or understand someone (e.g. if it's loud or I don't know their accent very well), I'll pick up a phone as soon as it starts ringing.\n\nI've had new starters who struggled as well, and I've offered to randomly phone them throughout the day for a few days so they'll get used to the phone ringing. It really does help.",
            "Yes, I used to.  My solution was to take the offensive and whenever receiving a call or talking to new people to always have something to say planned.  Remember that a lot of people have some level of social anxiety.  Try to take the initiative and make things comfortable for everyone by putting others at ease.  That's how I put myself at ease.\n\nAlso, don't be afraid of awkward silences, they're only awkward if you feel they are.  Not every moment has to be crammed with talking or laughter.",
            "Yep.",
            "Omg",
            "I swear I hear this all the time. People always say they get an anxiety attack when their phone rings. I just can't relate. It doesn't affect me any more than talking to someone irl does. I just don't understand it.",
            "I only have that when it's an unknown number. I don't want to get into a conversation with strangers whom I don't have the number saved. ",
            "Yeah because well half the time they can't hear me or I'm talking to quietly mumblling etc plus I'm talking to people which already sucks ass then there's the factor that we're talking on a device and that makes it even more awkward I'd rather face to face even with anxiety. Having no like face to talk to is really awkward for me idk if thats part of me being on the spectrum of autism or what cause I know a lot of people who'd rather talk on the phone",
            "These days anyone who calls is either: selling something, scamming, confirming an appointment, or friends/family calling in an emergency. I only answer calls if I know the number and/or am expecting a call.",
            "Yes!  I am also not very courageous when it comes to knocking on a door, even if they are expecting me.",
            "Not really it's either a bill collector or my mom, not talking to either of them so problem solved",
            "The worst part of my day is every time my phone rings",
            "r/introvert ",
            "Yes. I hate talking on the phone. I'm always worried it's gonna be something bad. And I don't even like calling to order pizza, let alone something like making a doctors appointment. It's the same thing when the doorbell rings. I'm always worried it's gonna be something bad. ",
            "I stopped answering at all, 99.9% of them are scams.\n",
            "Yes, totally have that fear. Phone calls are bad news. I feel like I'm in trouble, I've fucked up. Some crucial matter needs to be addressed *right now*! Otherwise, whatever it is could have been handled via a text or e-mail. If somebody needs to reach me immediately, it can't be good. It's so frightening that the sound of a phone, even if it's not mine, causes me anxiety. ",
            "I'm getting better and working on it but after doing a 5 year stint on a corporate IT help desk/call center I fucking hate it when my phone rings and instantly fill with rage. I hate even talking an the phone now and have to work myself up so much to make a call. But like I said I'm working on it and am getting better. It helps that I no longer work on the help desk.",
            "I just never answer calls anymore if I don't recognize the #, because 99.999% of the time it's spam anyway. I feel like it's just not normal anymore, and if someone calls vs texts it seems more serious or urgent.",
            "Yes, totally! But I also suffer from some form of anxiety, and social anxiety often creeps into that, telephone calls being a huge trigger. ",
            "Yes! Oh my God, I ALWAYS think someone died!",
            "Yes. I never did until I started working for a call center. Jesus Christ!",
            "Yes, especially when it\u2019s my mom. When mom calls it\u2019s always bad news, typically someone or a pet died.",
            "I\u2019m more hoping that it\u2019s an actual telemarketer to mess with rather than a machine",
            "I only panic when it\u2019s certain people or certain people combined with certain times of the day. If it\u2019s past like...5pm and my mom calls then I panic thinking someone has died. ",
            "It's not irrational, because it's mostly spammers and cold callers that I don't want to talk to.\n\nI find getting phone calls actually  more an annoyance than anxious. I have to stop what I'm doing, pick up the thing, and listen while someone prattles on, and try to be polite and steer the call to a conclusion, so I can go back to what I was doing.",
            "Only persons who call me are company & my parents, so I'm very (VERY) bad at answering calls. I've started now to hate it when my friends call instead of using Whatsapp of Facebook for chatting. ",
            "Same here.  I can't stand answering the phone.  It triggers anxiety in me, and I have no clue why.  Even when I know who it is I get uncomfortable.  Unfortunetly, I have a job in managment that involves answering a lot of phone calls.  I have a work issued cell phone, and I have gotten used to answering the phone for numbers I know.  Local numbers that I don't know, I still have to answer even though I don't know who they are.  I have a friend in my office who answers all my out of the area calls(if he is around), and if they are not work related calls he messes with them for me.  He has gotten telemarketers to hang up on him(he's not rude, he always pretends to be an older man who can barely hear them but maintaines a fake interest in their calls).",
            "I get that way,too. I just let it go to voicemail then call back if needed.",
            "Big time, but it is partially my parents fault for not letting me answer the phone as a little kid, which led me to think that there was a scary person at the other end. ",
            "Yes!! I thought I was the only one! My anxiety shoots through the roof even if someone I want to talk to is calling me.",
            "Yes.  Always.  I hate it. ",
            "Yes, and emails too. Sux. I think part of it is anxiety, part depression, but another part is \"What do these people want me to do now?\"",
            "Is it the same thing with being scared to open doors and stuff?",
            "I remember being totally enthralled by the mailbox. As a child, things showing up in that box was like magic for me. Mail = Amazing, always. Then as I grew older it became a nightmare. Nothing good EVER comes in the mail anymore unless I ordered it from Amazon.\n\nSomewhere along the line phone calls went the same exact way. If I don't have your number in my phone then what could you possibly want to talk to me about? Nobody calls me to give me money, only to ask for it. I basically never answer any phone calls and even when I do my heart is in my throat.",
            "Unless it is my family or girlfriend then yes. I used text back what you want to any of my contacts. if they aren't a contact and don't leave a voicemail then I will never talk to them. My voicemail even says leave a message because chances are that I won't answer and I never pick up numbers I don't know.",
            "Yes. As Rick Grimes taught me: \"There's always an angle\". People always want something. They can text me if they want favors.",
            "I wouldn\u2019t know, no one ever calls me",
            "Yes, but it's way stronger when I am the one making the phone call",
            "Yes, Avoidant Personality Disorder here.... it also translates to mail (not email), interpersonal power dynamics, meeting people.  ",
            "When my brain is overwhelmed/I'm stretched pretty thin as far as stress goes, answering the phone is bad, and made miserable because 9-outta-10 calls are spam.",
            "Yep. That's anxiety for ya. ",
            "Jaiden animations?????",
            "Used to. Then I got meds.",
            "I'm hearing impared, so I hate making and receiving calls. I hate that is a fair chance that I won't be able understand the person on the other end. I also hate the fact that I need to crank up the volume and that anyone with normal hearing and are within 10 feet of me can clearly hear both sides of the conversation. ",
            "I get paranoid when someone knocks at my door and I'm not expecting anyone. Like \"Who is that? The police? A group of people coming to break in and beat me up?\"\n\nIt's irrational and frustrating!",
            "Yes. Just yesterday I got a random call from a number that had Russia as the caller ID. I don't know anyone from Russia. Maybe Putin needed a word with me. Putin or not, I was never going to pick up because of my crippling phonecall anxiety.",
            "I work on a call center so yes. ",
            "I don't answer phone calls unless it is someone I know well",
            "100%",
            "I grew up before caller id so not answering the phone gives me anxiety, but i never answer the phone because it's always scammers. ",
            "100% it doesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s calling me it could be my mom my dad I can\u2019t bring myself to answer the phone ",
            "Yes, have the same thing and it's even worse cause I have my own business as well and I get 2-3 phone calls daily in which I have to explain stuff. So avoiding unknown numbers is almost impossible. \n\nI got to the point where I'm asking my gf to make a phone call to order food because I want to avoid talking on the phone as much as possible. ",
            "Yes.  I will avoid it at all costs.  Anyone I could possibly want to talk to knows to text me.  If they want to talk, they can text me and ask if they can call me so I can either say no or ignore them.  ",
            "unless it's the delivery person for the food I just ordered. Anything else and my heart skips a beat in panic",
            "Yes. For the most part hate the element of surprise that comes with a call, then being put in the spot to give a quick answer. Texting gives you time to think and ponder over your decision. Also, at least in my life, people only call when they want something from me, and I want to be in a position to reject it if needed - which I\u2019m not good at doing when put on the spot.",
            "Answering calls, making calls, answering the door even! You want to make my hands start shaking and my blood pressure go up? Just come knock on my door unexpectedly. Freaks me right the hell out. \n\nI\u2019m the worst about answering phone calls, regardless of whether I know who\u2019s calling or not, because I always imagine bad news on the other end. It\u2019s not as bad if it\u2019s a scheduled call, like \u201cI\u2019ll call you tomorrow\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ll call next week to work out the details,\u201d but an unexpected call freaks me out every time. \n\nAnd making a call is just as bad, if not worse. I tend to think things like, \u201cWhat if they\u2019re mad at me for not calling sooner or more often?\u201d So then I never call at all, because what if they\u2019re mad at me for never calling!? \n\nI work IT and I make phone calls all day, and I\u2019m fine with that (now, after six months). But personal calls are different, somehow. \n\nGlad I\u2019m not the only one. But also, kind of sucks that there are so many of us out there struggling with such a \u201csimple\u201d thing. ",
            "Yep. And I work in a call center. So yeah :( ",
            "Not so much fear, but intimidation yes.  To the point where I go out of my way to do things online and avoid speaking on the phone at all. :/",
            "I get a fear when I get a call from a saved number. Because I always think it\u2019s going to be something bad happened. Random numbers I could care less what they\u2019re calling about. I\u2019m not a CEO, so I only get robo calls",
            "Yes it has gotten me into trouble many times. ",
            "I don't know if it's irrational...but yes I do fear answering the phone and sometimes I only fine relief when I hang up even if the call went well.",
            "Sort of, but I actually have more anxiety having to make calls for some reason. I don't know why. I always put off even trivial phone calls for no reason. ",
            "That's why I dont answer calls lol, you can msg me. So many spam calls now too, it's just not worth my time.",
            "Eh for me it is making calls. I'd love if friends called me but calling people is scary for me. ",
            "Yes. I hate making phone calls too. I\u2019ll put off making a call even for simple things, like scheduling an appointment. I know it\u2019s not normal to act this way, but I can\u2019t help it.\n",
            "I have to call someone right now and I keep putting it off. I don\u2019t have real big anxiety except for the phone.",
            "Not here. If you're asking for yourself, try to take this piece of advice: you own the conversation once you answer. This means you also have the ability to end it. It may be hard for someone with anxiety to do so, but not having to deal with it face to face, you have much greater control of where things go so take advantage if it!",
            "Not me personally, but some of the people in my family have a fear mostly that something bad has happened.",
            "Yes. I have a phone phobia. I can barely answer a call from someone I WANT to talk to. Often I only answer, because I know I won't call them back, and I really like them, I just hate the phone. When the phone rings I have the urge to run and hide. If anyone else is in the house, I hope they answer, and pretend I have to go to the bathroom... \n\nBut what is even worse, it takes me all day to make a call. I get so nervous and can't breathe. I make a list of things that I need to say, because my mind goes blank if I managed to dial the number. If/when I finally make a call, the rest of the day I am so exhausted, I can't deal with anything else. \n\nI didn't start out that way, as a child I loved getting phone calls, and even making them wasn't scary. I am old, and remember making crank phone calls! It was fun! Now I can't function when a phone is involved.",
            "My best friend does. So I don't call her. If I really need to, i.e. driving, I wait for it to go to voice mail. 50/50 shot of her listening to it.",
            "I get more of an irrational annoyance, because more often than not any call from a number I don\u2019t recognize is just a damn telemarketer/robot. I tend not to answer them anymore. If it\u2019s important, they\u2019ll leave a voicemail, same with a friend, though they\u2019d also usually text me first, unless it\u2019s urgent, in which case they text before, and after, in addition to a voicemail. \n\nAlthough I do have to answer them, as sometimes it\u2019s my doctor/hospital trying to tell me something or book something. If it\u2019s my area code, I usually don\u2019t answer, because telemarketers spoof the number to make it look like it\u2019s from your area code. If I do answer, I say Hello quietly. It\u2019s loud enough that a human on the other end would know you were there, but not loud enough for the robots or telemarketing software to connect. \n\nI do always answer \u201cNo Caller ID\u201d and Blocked Caller IDs because the only people who call me that way, is the Psych hospital that I\u2019m participating in a study for. That\u2019s how I know it\u2019s them calling. Nobody else I know of actually blocks numbers, telemarketers don\u2019t block when they can just spoof the number to be whatever they want. \n\nNow when I do get a call, like from my dad or mom, I do have a small worry that something has happened, that maybe dad has had another heart attack, or someone has been in an accident. \n\nI prefer text because it doesn\u2019t have that moment of dread and fear before answering. Maybe because texts tend to be mundane, like \u201cdo we need anymore apple sauce\u201d or \u201chere\u2019s a cute picture of a dog\u201d. Even a text that said someone was in an accident doesn\u2019t have that moment of uncertainty before reading it. There\u2019s plenty of fear after reading it, and you can be damned certain I\u2019m going to call as soon as I get that text. \n\nMight be a generational thing too. I find texts to not be urgent, you get to them when you get to them, however phone calls are urgent, you need to decide to respond or decline the call, but you don\u2019t know how urgent it really is, since all you get is caller ID. So your mind can jump to all the worst conclusions of what urgent matter warranted a call. ",
            "lol no it gives me someone else to yell at if I don't know them.",
            "I once had my alarm and ringtone set to the same tune. Whenever someone called i would get a shock like i had just been brutally awakened from deep sleep.",
            "Yes. It's not irrational though. My fear mainly stems from the fact that I sound retarded with my voice. That's not irrational",
            "yes",
            "Oh absolutely, but not answering and wondering if it was something really important makes me even more anxious.",
            "My husband received a phone call from the police on an all 0 number in high school and has refused to answer phone calls ever since.",
            "Nah.  Easy enough to just hang up if it starts going sideways and blame it on the phone crapping out or turning off or something.",
            "If anyone other than my grandparents calls me rather than send a text, its probably an emergency. ",
            "My wife does",
            "I work in a control room and confidently take dozens if not hundreds of emergency calls a day with a high level of customer service, but when I get home if my phone rings I never answer it unless it's close family. I also can't abide having my phone off silent and I never check voicemail.",
            "Lmao all commenters are my brethren ",
            "Yes, but I work in a call centre and it\u2019s always an angry customer so it kinda explains it. ",
            "I do. I always think it\u2019s old friends I\u2019ve long tried to excommunicate from my life.",
            "I had it when I was an intern at our office, which specializes on training programs. My heart would beat fast and I would do anything just so I can escape phone answering duties. ",
            "Many of the calls I receive are telemarketers. Haven't done it yet, but I'm contemplating answering as if I work at a restaurant and try to get them to order. By doing this, I hope I can reduce the number of unwanted calls.",
            "I'm fine dealing with phones as long as I have all the information I need.\n\nBut my girlfriend cannot handle phones at all. Live chat with VoIP with gamer buddies is fine and she could do that all day. I use to be confused about it it's just a phone talk like a person.\n\nI once had to call her to get important time critical information from her. And I felt like I called a complete stranger. A lobitmized one at that.\n\nIt made getting a job so incredibly hard and I use to be upset about it.\n\nI tried to help out by being roleplaying (for a lack of better words) who she needed to call and sample answers.\n\nYears later...I had to deal with her parents. They're the single most hated people to be called by. Like all phone manners just thrown out of the window into a dumpster fire.\n\nI dread being called. And they call me because they know she just doesn't pick up. It feels like I'm being interrogated for the most mundane things. Even when being asked for help with common things.\n\nIt awful. Having to deal with them. I now understand why girlfriend can't handle phones. Imagine growing up as a kid dealing with this behaviour. \n\nA lot of her behaviour and social skills make a lot of sense since I met her parents.",
            "Yes. Mostly because I dislike speaking to anyone. and 9 our of 10 times it is because someone needs something or something is wrong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo one calls me just to hear my voice anymore.",
            "Yeah, but with good reason. Everyone I know is in my phone, everyone else is annoying solicitors and one old druggie friend that *really* gives me anxiety",
            "Only if it\u2019s people outside my family tbh, I still feel weird calling friends and people I know very well.",

We were walking home from dinner and unbeknownst to me she put a few white tic tacs in her mouth - she pretended to sneeze and spit a couple teeth out. It shocked me for half a second and took my brain a bit longer to figure out what happened and by that point she was laughing hysterically. She loved the prank so much.\n\nI of course pointed out that she just started a new phase in our relationship - a pranks phase. Her face immediately dropped as she realized our unspoken truce of not pranking each other has been broken. \n\nEnough time has passed and I want to \u201cget her back.\u201d I want something as benign and quick as hers, and I can\u2019t think of friggin anything. Any master pranksters here that can help me?\n\nEDIT 1: obviously this got much more attention than I expected lol. Thank you to everyone for your ideas, at their best they were great ideas I considered and at their worst they were hilarious, outlandish, and fun to read. Want to clarify one thing: the \u201cpranks phase\u201d was said tongue in cheek to her to get a rise out of her, there will be no actual pranks phase - I\u2019m going to do this one and that will be it. She generally doesn\u2019t enjoy pranks which is why the one she did was so fun to me and I\u2019m excited to give her that same bit of joy I had! Tonight is the night! I\u2019ve decided to go with the dry pasta/back crack. I think it\u2019s the closest to what she did to me and the easiest to pull off. She had two long days at work so I didn\u2019t want to add to it which is why there was a delay. I\u2019ll update again with how it went in about 12 hours!",

            "Not quite the same thing, but about fifteen years ago my wife and I acquired a silver statuette of two mating tortoises from\u2026 somewhere, I forget where. We both loved how hideously tasteless it was. One day, one of us decided to hide it somewhere the other would find it (like under a cushion), and that was it - the game was on. \n\nIt now gets hidden in increasingly unusual places, and the deal is that when you find it, you have to hide it again for the other person to find (without saying you found it). It\u2019s followed us through three house moves, and has even gone abroad with us. It\u2019s been behind the sink, in a winter coat that has been stored away over the summer, in a first-aid kit, at the back of the fridge, inside a teddy bear\u2026 you name it. Sometimes it\u2019s found within days, sometimes it takes months. Sometimes it\u2019s so long that we both forget where it\u2019s hidden (it\u2019s been about a year and a half since I\u2019ve seen it now).\n\nI love that moment when I glimpse a bit of silver and realise that was a *damned good* hiding place. And then the creativity of trying to find an even *better* hiding place is fun, too.",

            "When my wife first moved to my town she started meeting my circle of friends. She would end up in a discussion with someone and casually mention my tap dancing. I do not tap dance. She would give a different bit of the picture to each person she met. I practiced in the park on weekends with a piece of plywood I carried out there. I had a whole outfit. My hero was Fred Astaire. And she\u2019d end by saying something like, oh don\u2019t tell him I told you he\u2019s sensitive about it. \n\nThen, slowly, over the course of months, I\u2019d be talking to someone and they would say something like, \u201coh, am I wrong or was it you that tap dances?\u201d Or \u201coh hey look it\u2019s Fred Astaire in this YouTube clip I thought you\u2019d like to see it.\u201d This went on for ages and came at me from all directions and never could anyone recall from whom they\u2019d heard it.

            "When I was in 10th grade in CA in 1980, my parents rented a 3BR 1.5bath teeeny-yard house. Some years later it was on the market for $220,000 US. I figured that proved it: I would never, ever be able to afford a house. But in the year 2000, my parents bought a near identical house but with a backyard 3x the size, in a better neighborhood, for $39,000 US. How? Well it was in Oklahoma, not California. I own that house now. Granted, even now it is only worth maybe 70-80K. And granted, there's no fuckin' jobs here compared to any big city (we are a county-seat city, about 40 minutes from Joplin MO, which does have some jobs though). But I think the reality is that if people migrate to a place with a sane housing market, and if two people are both working and not getting divorced or blowing their money, people can still buy property. But... not in most the big cities. The property expense is so insane compared to wages that the smallest crisis is devastating.\n\nEdit to add: people who can do basic carpentry work really are missing their calling. There are houses here with like, 4-5 bedrooms, 2K+sf, for like 50-120K, because of course they need some work, but they're livable. It's really just a matter of whether you can work a pretty low paid factory job (there's some of those here, everything else is retail or medical). If you have any medical skills there's plenty of work it seems.",

You contribute up to the match, which gives you $4k in contributions per year. For a conservative estimate, let's say you get shitty annual returns averaging 5%, compounding daily.\n\nIf you never advanced in your career between now and the current full retirement age, you'd have about $514k + whatever social security looks like at that time.\n\nTime is on your side man, take a breath!",

            "I've never really been one for travelling, but I definitely used to wonder/worry if I'd ever be able to afford a house or to retire in the future as little as 5 years ago.  At that time, I was working almost minimum wage, often doing 80-100 hours a week, and still drowning in student loan debt and living paycheck to paycheck.\n\nHowever, since then, I managed to finally get a good job using my degree and start saving up money and building a 401k and such.

In 3 or so years ill be making enough to buy a small townhouse (California.)\n\nPlus since its a bank the healthcare, retirement plan,  and work life balance is great. Ive since gone back to college to get a degree and they are paying for ~90% of it.\n\nI'm not trying to brag, merely say that I went from minimum wage retail job that made me hate life to doing something I dont really like but also don't hate.

            "Let's see... I graduated from high school and went to work at restaurants as a dishwasher for 2 years in order to have money and have fun. It was the case as I was living at my mom's house and it cost me very little. I then worked night shifts at a self service gas station. I did that for 4 years. I made a little bit more money and started to hang out every weekends at the dance clubs where I started using hard drugs. I had an opportunity to learn the autoparts trade, so I did that for 4-5 years with all the money I made going into having fun with booze, coke and ladies. I went into rehab at the age of 30. On my return, my employer fired me so I took this new opportunity to go back to school. I took a 1800 hours course in Computer science and graduated with high notes. I worked in a multimedia studio for 1 year and lived it but I was working too many hours, sometimes up to 80 h/week. I had another opportunity to work as an IT teacher not long after I quit my first job. I did that for 12 years and loved it. I had to go at the university part time to get a teacher's degree. I ever completed my schooling as I quit teaching before I could. Not long after quiting work I slowly started to drink again and went back to hard drugs. I had the chance to buy a house while teaching but did not really put money aside, on the contrary, my old habits got me very deep in debts. I did that for 8 years before I got back in rehab and got my life straightened out again. Remember: no money, only debts. Just 3 years before I went to rehab I found a job  in IT for a big American company. That company made it all possible to me to salvage my future. They contributed to my 401 and the salary was high enough for me to erase all my debts and but a few grands aside. Fast forward today. I'm retirering on April 29th 2022 at the age of 58. So YES, it's possible to retire at one point if you do the right things at the right time. I never thought I'd be able to retire at that age when I was washing dishes... You can do it too.",

I got my undergrad degree in the best school of the country, a business bachelor, and everyone told me back then that it would never not have a job for me (my real wish was to teach Literature) and that's definitely the opposite ofy entire life post-college.

The last two years I have struggled to pay for the house and it was the only thing I thought I have been doing right in life.  House got bought out by the bank they upped the rate I had to pay and I just said fuck it and let it go to the bank it was hard enough living with the memories in that place.  I inherited an acre of land so I bought a 5th wheel and living in it.

I drive an hour to and from work every day to a job where I\u2019m their best employee yet I\u2019m constantly reminded how replaceable I am but not getting a raise for a year and half now same job and company for 8 years and nothing boss built a 3 million dollar home for himself this year I only owed 10k on the house left.  I sold my guns cause I just don\u2019t trust myself right now.  But constantly fear any moment I may need them to defend myself cause of how chaotic the world is becoming.  I\u2019m so tired.

I opened a savings account but lately I haven't been able to put anything aside because after social security, taxes and rent, what I end up with is so little that I can't afford to spare a cent for anything that's not a basic necessity. If I manage to, great, but it's really hard.\n\nTo me, and in the country I live in, the problem is that prices are getting considerably higher without salaries raising to match them, the insane amount that is discounted from our salaries by the state and the cost of rent for a single room. Everyone is struggling so landlords - majority of which have always been a bit exploitative - are now marking up shitholes as \u20ac500 rooms. Given that perspective my rent is not that high, but in itself, and considering the lack of maintenance in the house, it's high.\n\nIf you're single, renting a flat is out of the question here unless you earn at least 1k more than I do (but then you'd be taxed more than I am, so it begs the question). Buying is out of the question unless you were a superbaby and opened a savings account as soon as you popped out. Loans? Things changed this year as well. The difficulty to get your request accepted is the same, but now you have to pay back until you retire. So imagine I get a loan and buy a small flat for me, my dog, my fish and my books. Let's say the flat is 100.000. I'd have to pay that back in 30 years, so the monthly fee would be considerably higher than it was before this whole thing changed and I'd be back to paying an exorbitant \"rent\" again, living from paycheck to paycheck again with the added expense of electricity, water and wi-fi - which is included when you rent a room.\n\nI honestly feel like I will spend my life renting rooms. I'm writing this from my parents' because I have to save some money this month so I have something to fall on when, next month, I get my paycheck, am deducted a monstrosity and live shut inside my room because going to the movies costs money, going anywhere costs transportation money and it's better to have coffee at home because it's free.  \n\n\nSo the scenario here is very bleak and depressing unless you graduated from IT or management or engineering (and not all are proof of a good job), started work the month after you graduated so that by your 30s you're in a good enough position to buy a house, travel and tell all your poor ass co-workers how wonderful it was in the Bahamas.  \n\n\nI don't have much of a future either.",

As long as a species is able to successfully reproduce, evolution doesn't care about details like \"quality of life.\"",
            "Evolution cares about one thing: do we have children and raise them to a point of self-sufficiency.\n\nAny time the answer is \"no,\" natural selection will correct this or the species will go extinct.\n\nAny time the answer is \"yes,\" natural selection says \"Good enough!\"",

            "I actually know the answer! We actually used to have to be able to orgasm in order to release an egg like certain animals still  do. The clit evolved AWAY from the uterus to the front of our vaginas. That\u2019s why we can have sex and not orgasm but men still have to orgasm to procreate. Studies show that women who are trying to get pregnant can have an easier time if they orgasm every time they try versus the women who have sex to have a baby and are not orgasming. \n\n\nhttps://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/study-female-orgasm-might-be-evolutionary-leftover-180959973/\n\nEdit: the clit/orgasm was always just a \u201cplus\u201d for us, but it was not necessary to procreate. That\u2019s what the article says.",
            "Most people cannot orgasm vaginally because there aren't very many sensitive nerve endings inside the vagina. This is because, well besides the obvious \"that's not how evolution works\" thing, you do NOT want there to be a high density of nerves inside the hole you plan to push a baby out of. That would honestly be so painful I think most people would die from shock during childbirth, and that wouldn't exactly be of evolutionary benefit. Imagine if you had to shove your entire fist through your urethra to continue the human species. You're welcome. \n\nThe clitoris is there for a reason. It can even be stimulated through the motion of missionary sex, males don't typically have a large mons pubis, or mound of venus like females do. The male pubic bone is more exposed, and this can stimulate the clit during PIV sex and cause orgasm. Definitely some evolutionary benefit to having the female desire sex/make it pleasurable and there is evidence of that, don't listen to people who say \"evolution doesn't care about orgasms\" because actually, it really does. Human history was not built 100% on rape, having a consenting partner is quite important in the continuation of a sapient species.",

            "I haven\u2019t really seen a right answer here yet, just random guesses. I have heard one theory for this\u2014and it\u2019s not that it is a design flaw. If women had enough nerve endings in the vaginal canal to cause an orgasm this way, imagine giving birth. Having that many nerves in the vaginal canal would make birth exponentially more painful.

            "Officers don't generally do that. It's more of a movie thing. \n\nI've had detectives and FBI agents come speak to me (not about stuff I did wrong). They usually just say who they are. If you ask (which you should) for ID they show a photo ID card, not a badge, although there may be a badge with it. If that's still not good enough (it isn't) you can ask for a card. Google the number for their office (for the FBI it would be the local field office) and confirm who they are. Do not call the number on their card. The people on the phone can help confirm their identify. \n\nYou shouldn't just trust a uniform, badge and car. Those are easy enough to fake.",

Those are much more difficult to fake.\n\nIf it's hypothetically a SWAT raid or something like that then it doesn't really make a difference, because if they're fake then they guns at you anyway, and if they're not fake then you'll know soon when they take you to the station.",
            "So badges can be meaningless, as many have stated. What is important is the rest of the credentials supplied. There should be photo ID with the number on the badge matching the number on the ID. Better ID cards can have security features but smaller law enforcement agencies don't always have newer equipment to work with.\n\nAs for US Federal LEO credentials, the laminated ID photo parts are somewhat standardized but the metal badges are  different sizes, shapes, weights and colors between agencies. There are multiple security features on the laminated photo portion. Primary identification should be verified with photo credentials, not a metal shield. If you are shown only a metal shield and the person refuses to show their accompanying credentials, call 911.\n\nFinally, if there's ever a question if a non uniformed law enforcement officer  is legit and you feel something is wrong, lock your door (or stay in your vehicle) and make them wait outside and call 911 for a uniformed unit to respond.\n\nEdit: words and formatting",

            "Quick story - semi related, happened many moons ago. \n\nI used to bounce at a strip club (not a glamorous job but paid the bills through college).  Had a plain clothes police officer come in.  We ID and scan everyone's ID into this software we have (local network stores info with other bars and clubs in the area used for anti gang or recording info, say someone gets into a fight or steals etc etc notes can be stored there and other bars and clubs can see it when scanning that person's ID and also cops come to check it sometimes for certain people), anyhow, cop flashes his badge.  I ask if he's on duty, to which he says no, so I ask for identification.  He insists his badge is fine and I tell him that is required as we have certain requirements for establishments that serve alcohol that it needs to be a drivers license, ID card, military ID and I think that's all?  So technically a badge doesn't count.  We go back and forth about it and he says he's here to see a dancer who is a CI (confidential informant), to which I say you just said you're not on duty so which is it?  Also why you'd tell a bouncer who works at a strip club loosely affiliated with a well known biker gang (I have no affiliation with whatsoever) that sort of thing is beyond me, so I tell him I need to pat him down and what dancer is he here to see and I can get her to come out.  He is beyond frustrated, refuses and leaves.  This whole exchange was a good 5 minutes.  \n\nWhen I go to the dressing area and knock on the door, enter, and ask the girls if they were expecting a cop to come by and I describe them one of em is mortified and says he's been stalking her.  Now she may have actually been a CI and needed to play it off but I have my doubts. \n\nLong story short, a badge isn't ID and yeah always call and ask for a supervisor, don't answer questions and never stop or roll down a window or open a door without being certain.  They also should always be carrying a card with them, that can help you decide.  If they're plain clothes though that's a red flag unless you're a.... Let's say interesting character with a checkered past.",
            "I work as a property manager and have FBI and other higher up law enforcement come by often to ask questions about residents.

I don\u2019t think FBI agents really go out alone.   And when I worked in LE we were NOT permitted to use our badge / flash our credits off duty.  \n\nSo if some random guy pops up saying he is FBI in Kroger\u2019s I\u2019d be skeptical.

Said he was \u201cout on patrol\u201d.   \n\nNone of it checked out to me so I called the non emergency line and sure enough by the time I went up, around the street and back down the hill he was being stopped and questioned. \n\nPosing as LE is a big No No.\n\n\nEdit:  posters are correct you can buy badges from Surplus and online.",

            "You're never going to have to worry about it, because think about what the circumstances are going to be:\n\n- You're getting pulled over by a cop car. Should be obvious that the dude is a cop from his car, uniform, gun, radio, etc. \n\n- You've been targeted with a search warrant, in which case it won't be 1 guy who shows up, it will be a whole team of guys. Being able to fake 1 cop is one thing, being able to fake a bunch of cops, and the paperwork and all that, is super difficult, plus they can't stop you from making phone calls, and they're going to be there exposed for a long time if they're fakes, easily caught.\n\nYou might have an issue if a \"plainclothes\" cop car pulls you over, but this is really rare, and people DO push back against those cops sometimes. I saw a court case where some plainclothes cops pulled over a female lawyer and she refused to cooperate with them, so they hassled her and detained her for a while, so she sued them. I don't know how the lawsuit went but 99% chance she lost simply because federal courts hate petty shit like that with a burning passion.",

This needs to be done in front of the Officer AND you need to state I am not resisting / arguing / fighting etc etc. \n\nOnce confirmed or not confirmed (yell help) you can be sure the Officer in front of you is indeed there for a valid reason. \n\non a side note the Authority (at least here) comes from a warrant card, the badge is more symbolic, the warrant card carries the authority.",
            "This is waaayyyy down the comment chain, so hopefully it can help somebody out. \n\n1. Most officers have a \u201cbe the best witness\u201d approach when not in uniform. Under most circumstances I wouldn\u2019t mention my job when not actually wearing a uniform because it\u2019s a major pain. So if somebody in normal clothes told me they were a cop I would immediately be suspicious. \n\n2. I always carry a police id with me that includes a picture and various details of my agency in and out of uniform. If somebody specifically asked to see my id in addition to my badge I would be more than happy to comply. \n\n3. If somebody is attempting to pull you over and you suspect it\u2019s not a cop drive somewhere very public. Our traffic guys (unmarked cars) have followed people for miles with lights and sirens without initiating a chase. It\u2019s because most real cops know that that\u2019s a legitimate concern and if you explain your concern will not hold it against you. \n\nStill not a perfect system and I can\u2019t guarantee that a cop wouldn\u2019t be pissed if you kept driving.

They asked me to ID myself and asked me to step closer to the car.\n\nI didn\u2019t like that behavior a lot and asked them to hold the ID further out to have me look at it more closely or leave the car (alone) to allow me to look at it better in the streetlight. They suddenly stepped on the gas and left the scene. I called the cops after that and asked them if they had a weird care (with three ! people) going around. Those people said they were crime investigation and the cops told me they had no one and put down my data for future reference. Nothing ever came of it but I know that it was likely very good I didn\u2019t step closer. They either wanted to steal my ID, myself or in the best case only scare me. But I also know they left quickly because I asked them to look closer at their badges.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure an honest cop or fbi person would allow you to check if they are legit if they were there for honest reasons. So basically I think they flash it only to tell you that they are who they say they are and if you want to be sure, you need to ask for further confirmation? At least that\u2019s what I am gonna do  again if I think it\u2019s fishy."

Community could be friends, family, coworkers, acquaintances, the people who run the hardware store in town or just how their county / town votes \n* Those who do their homework and pick the candidate carefully.\n\nMy mother-in-law was a combination:\n\n* She hated Trump but voted republican\n* She had heard false stories about Hillary Clinton from her son (e.g. Hillary had fallen, hit her head, and had an ABI that meant she was not suitable to lead)\n* I think she was a Fox News watcher by-proxy (FIL had it on TV all the time, and she just overheard it often enough)\n* The district her and my father-in-law live in are very deep red, so there's not a lot of opposing ideas being presented. \n\nSo basically, even if Trump says \"I am a dictator and my first act will be to execute Joe Biden and outlaw the democratic party, then I'll destroy the supreme court so I'm the sole decider of matters\" people will still vote for him because they think the republican party will pull him in line / they agree more with moderate republicans, than Trump, or they don't pay enough attention to what's going on, or they actually want Trump to do what he said.",
            "A dictator championed by those who love to spout about muh freedoms.",
            "This entire comment section should be enough to answer your question. Both aisles are full of ideologist  and fascist. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m tolerant, except for those damn republicans fucking inbred hick morons ruining this country. Trumps a dictator!\u201d \n\n\u201cThese liberals are trying to take our guns, religion, and force LGBTQIA propaganda down our kids throats. Bidens a puppet for the shadow state.\u201d \n\nI mean, what about any of this sounds rational or reasonable? There are no discussions, just screaming and name calling.",
            "Plenty of people consume barely no news at all and don\u2019t even know about those statements, or most of the awful things trump has done up to this point. Others tell themselves he\u2019s \u201cjust joking\u201d, or it doesn\u2019t matter if he wants to be a dictator because the system won\u2019t let him. People are great at believing what they want to believe. Other people believe he\u2019s serious and think it would be a good thing to have a dictatorship.\n\nI don\u2019t know that those statements will matter much in the election, but for them to matter more they\u2019ll have to be amplified by attack ads from Trump\u2019s opponents to break through to the people who won\u2019t consume them through the news. Might be the sort of thing to peel back soft Biden 2020 voters who were wavering, though probably not on its own.",
            "He's not supported by 50% of the country. About 66% voted in the last election, that's already down to a third of the country, then add on the people who don't vote for him but vote against Biden and Democrats for various reasons... you're probably looking at 20-25% if we're pessimistic voting for him. Probably 5% of that are heavily influenced by propaganda or otherwise misinformed, and its not as bad as it seems. Bad enough, but not 50% bad. \n\nAlso it's worth noting that there's not a whole lot incentivising people to vote for Biden either. Voting against Trump isn't enough. People need to see benefits for voting Democrats, and they're not giving them. \"We're not actively making your life shit\" isn't that great of a recruiting slogan, who knew?",
            "Don't listen to the polls. It's a bunch of bullshit.",
            "The REAL answer is because he was being facetious when he answered the question, and the question was also asked in jest.\n\nTrump doesn't have the power to become a dictator. No US President does. Talks of the US President becoming a dictator is just clickbait for the news channels, and fearmongering by the politicians. There is a reason why we have 3 branches of government and a separation of powers.\n\nIt won't work.\n\nSo, what you need to be asking yourself is why is the news media lying to you saying that Trump SERIOUSLY NOT AS A JOKE said he is going to be a dictator? Because, they want you to actually believe it to make this an existential threat to keep you voting for Biden no matter what",
            "You need to listen to the interview. Trump jokes that he'll be dictator for one day, when on his first day in office he recinds several of the executive orders Biden signed on his first day in office. \n\nBTW, He's also pointing out  Biden was a dictator when he signed those executive orders.",
            "Because most polls are conducted via land line........",
            "It's just incredible.  The MAGA people literally unearthed themselves once Trump made them feel special when he was elected.  Who are these people?  It's a damn shame, and very scary.",
            "White Christian nationalists are losing their political power via the ballot box, so they are rejecting democracy itself. Because at the end of the day, it\u2019s always been about power. They don\u2019t give a fuck about rights, and they definitely hate that younger generations are rejecting religion en masse. They\u2019re basically going to launch an inquisition, and forced conversions are probably on the table. And if you\u2019re trans, you are completely screwed. Or black, or woke, or if you\u2019re in any category that classifies you as a heretic in their eyes.\nIn short, democracy would get in the way of their cruelty. \nThat is why Trump is competitive."
