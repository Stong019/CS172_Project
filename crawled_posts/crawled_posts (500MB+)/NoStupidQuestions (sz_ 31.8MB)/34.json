            "I\u2019m exactly the same as that woman. We have a condition called ARFID (Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder). It\u2019s a real eating disorder whereby we simply can\u2019t eat most foods. \n\nIt\u2019s a deeply psychological thing and is out of our control. If the food is not the exact texture, smell, taste and temperature that I am familiar with, I cannot eat it without having an overt, involuntary physical reaction to it, which is mostly a gag reflex and possibly throwing up immediately. \n\nI\u2019ve lost friends and potential relationships to this disorder, been ostracised and bullied my entire life about it. I\u2019m 25 and I didn\u2019t even know this condition existed until a few months ago. \n\nIf someone is like this, please know that it\u2019s not by their own choice. Do you really think we would simply choose to make a fool out of ourselves and over complicate our lives for no reason? Just to be a \u201cpicky eater\u201d? \n\nIt\u2019s a genuine mental disorder and I pray to god that people understand this and ARFID gains some actual widespread recognition as a real eating disorder and the stigma can end.",
            "Maybe? It's hard to imagine cooking separate meals for the rest of our lives honestly.\n\nBeing a bit picky is fine but eating no vegetables is not something I can really imagine.",
            "My dad eats a VERY limited selection of vegetables and is an absurdly picky eater.  He's a good person, but it definitely impacts his health in a negative way.",
            "Yes. Also not drinking water. It\u2019s not the end of the world but it is an indicator of other traits.",
            "Not necessarily- people can have complex relationships with food. Maybe she\u2019s never had them prepared properly. My husband is branded as a picky eater but I then learned that his parents were and are terrible cooks. He dislikes bland, mushy, overcooked foods. Not exactly picky behavior. Sometimes it\u2019s a texture thing. Mint can be very strong to some people, especially if they are a super taster. Just some food for thought.",
            "Unless they have a good reason for it I\u2019d say so. Some people have legitimate sensory issues they\u2019d rather not have. I wouldn\u2019t say I have legitimate issues but a couple things I *know* taste good I won\u2019t eat because the texture is gross to me, yet if I was told I\u2019d win 100 dollars if I ate them I could, I just wouldn\u2019t choose voluntarily. \n\nIf this person is just like ooo veggies ick boo that\u2019s pretty immature yes. There\u2019s lots of different veggies and cooked well they don\u2019t taste anything alike. \n\nMaybe they and their family are terrible cooks though and they just avoid them cause they\u2019ve always had bland veggies and just need to try some good ones.",

            "Idk about red flag but it's certainly not a healthy diet to have in the long term. Whether or not it presents an issue depends on how important your partner's health is to you or how important being able to share a wide variety of foods is for you.\n\nPersonally I'm a vegetarian and love bonding with people through food, so I'd be pretty disappointed to find out I was dating someone who ate like that.",

            "A red flag is something that could be indicative of something else. Pushing her broccoli around her plate could have been a red flag that she might be a picky eater. Well good news! She straight up told you she\u2019s a picky eater so it\u2019s not a red flag, it\u2019s a personality trait. No mystery to solve.\n\nSo now it\u2019s up to you if that trait is a dealbreaker or not. Every single person in the world will have traits that some will see as dealbreakers and others not. Entirely up to you.\n\nMy wife is pretty amazing, but she is an extremely picky eater. I made the decision a long time ago that this was something I accepted about her. We cook some things together, some things alone, and whenever I\u2019m craving something that she doesn\u2019t like I\u2019ll order takeout or make plans with a friend.",
            "Being that picky- when it's pickiness and not an actual physical issue like food allergies- is often an eating disorder. Not all eating disorders are anorexia, but mentally they are equally damaging to the person who adheres to them.\n\nAnd no, having an eating disorder is not necessarily a sign of immaturity.",
            "I wouldn't necessarily say it's a red flag, because it really depends on the reasoning.\n\nLike they might be autistic and have pretty rigid preferences when it comes to food, in which case it's not a red flag whatsoever\n\nBut like let's say their reasoning is because theyre one of those people that hates vegetarians and doesn't want to eat \"rabbit food\", then yes it is a red flag\n\nBasically you can't know it's a red flag until you know why",

            "Hi!  Non veggie lover here.   Been married 25+ years and have three beautiful children who all eat a variety of vegetables.\n\nI grew up in the South where my grandma would sometimes just go in the backyard and pick dinner.  I tried, I really did.   I just couldn\u2019t get past texture and/or taste.   My favorite line is \u201cyou can\u2019t even taste it\u201d.   Ummm yes I can.  \n\nCan I say how I wish I liked them?   I have gone on an only veggie diet.  Try them each time I make a new recipe, pur\u00e9ed them, chopped them etc.   I really don\u2019t like them.\n\nDo you know what I would give to like salad?  What an amazing dish.  \n\nSo now that I have lived half a century - I have decided I have given my time.   I have also decided if some people don\u2019t like meat and won\u2019t eat it, I can do the same for vegetables.    There are few people that like every food, but it seems more judgement is on vegetables than any other food group.\n\nAs long as your date is okay with you eating whatever you want, let it go.  Trust me when I say she is probably more upset with it than you are.\n\nETA:  Thanks for the awards!",
            "yeeeaaaaahhhh.... at a certain point ppl should be experimenting w different ways of cooking. i was a kind of picky child, but in adulthood I started to try new things in restaurants, at parties, and just in cooking itself. there's a reason most people at some point end up having a favorite green veggie, or liking most veggies in general. it's because they tried it enough that they found a way they like it. this red flag would tell me that someone is either closed off or not open to newer experiences.",
            "Its hard to explain food aversions to someone who has none. \n\nI have a gene that makes all of the cabbage family taste bitter, i have a gene that makes cilantro taste of soap. \n\nOnions and garlic actually upset me though. Again its hard to explain. Its not a preference, its like...imagine someone hid a maggot in all your food. \n\nIt can't hurt you, can't make you sick, but to bite a maggot? It would make you cry. \n\nThat's how food is for some people.  Every meal from childhood was a god damned mission, success was getting through eating without becoming upset. \n\nSo it really depends on how important food is to you. I could never date anyone who loved garlic for example. I wouldn't call it a red flag though.",
            "is it just me or has 'red flag' become diluted to the point of meaning basically nothing? it used to be like, signs that this person is likely to beat you and stuff, not like, \"oh this person doesn't like my favourite band\" lmao.",
            "Guy with the same eating habits. I may be different but I personally hate being this way. For me it's a neurodivergent thing. When something doesn't taste good, that includes things that I find not unpleasant but middling, I can't willingly eat. I force myself to eat things all the time that I don't find appetizing. It's like being picky but amped up to 1000%. I'm trying to stop but it's insanely hard.",
            "I hate veggies so I mix em with fruit and drink em. Thank you, veggie shake",
            "Some people have food aversions, so I get it. She may also have sensory issues with the toothpaste thing. I think if you aren\u2019t used to seeing people with those issues then yeah it look like a red flag. However, these people may be neurodivergent (idk ofc). A lot of times they cannot help it, and I think it\u2019s more important to be kind about these sort of things. Maybe she just isn\u2019t who you are looking for and that is perfectly fine. That doesn\u2019t make her a red flag though.",
            "I\u2019d say it\u2019s a yellow flag. \n\nMostly consider if you want to spend a long time period accommodating that dietary restriction, and if the future health issues that will inevitably bring are things you want to have to watch and be relatively helpless to assist with. \n\nIt\u2019s not always gonna be a dealbreaker, but it could be for some people.",
            "It really depends on why they don't eat vegetables.",
            "Red flags are personal.  Sure, there's a lot of overlap between people but red flags aren't universal.\n\nI think it's a little immature to just dismiss all vegetables like that.  Potatoes aren't even a vegetable, culinarily speaking.  If you are looking for a long term partner, that may factor into how healthy she'll be in the future.",
            "There could be a medical reason for it. I cannot have any raw vegetables, a salad will put me in the ER",

            "Maybe she's sensitive to most vegetables. I have ibs and get really bloated from eating them. Not everything is a red flag lol",
            "I'm autistic. Eating a lot of \"healthy\" foods is like torture for me because of my heightened sense of taste. Vegetables that others say \"have no taste\" (cucumbers, iceberg lettuce, etc) are repulsive to me. Veggies with a stronger flavor are overly bitter. There's only a few vegetables I can tolerate.  Brushing my teeth has always been a pain due to sensory overload, and mint toothpaste can be overwhelming. I used children's toothpaste well into my teens because it's more mild. I also use flavorless mouthwash; I can't use normal mouthwash at all.\n\nMy hairdresser has an autistic son who's favorite type of juice is made at two different manufacturing plants. He doesn't know this (he was too young to read when he started drinking it), but he can tell the difference in taste and will only drink one of them. His mom has to check the labels for the country it was made in before buying it. This is the level of heightened taste we're talking about here. \n\nI don't think it's a red flag on its own at all. People have this assumption that \"picky\" eating or refusal to eat vegetables is always childish behavior, and that's leading some of the commenters to assume she may be childish or irresponsible in other ways. But if it's a sensory processing issue or low support needs Autism then this won't be the case. Obviously it's not going to be great for her health in the long term if she eats zero vegetables, so I guess it's up to you if that's a dealbreaker.",

I live in DC, have zero involvement with law enforcement, but have known several Secret Service guys over the years, used to work at a take out restaurant across the street practically from The US Naval Observatory, which is where the Vice President lives, and his team was in frequently, they are very very serious dudes, and if shit gets real, they are authorized to take control of the whole scene.

            "Because cooking at home doesn't pay!\n\nFor example knitting used to be a sole male profession back then since it was highly paid. \nAs machines were introduced in the industry the pay plummeted and guess what? \nIt became a female craft.\n\nThat's how society traditionaly worked for ages. \nWhat is profitable is man's work and women work for nothing or little pay.",
            "This goes with a lot of professions. Teachers vs professors, nurses vs doctors. \n\nAlso interesting observation: once women started becoming secretaries, the profession started getting paid way less and being taken less seriously. Same with teachers.",
            "other answers here are pretty simplistic so basically:\n\nwomen were the primary cooks up until the concept of going to a place specifically to eat a quality meal (i.e., a restaurant) became popular. remember that the concept of restaurants (as we know it today) didn't really exist until the late 18th century.\n\nonce people realized that this was a potentially lucrative business, women were pushed out. and, in many places, women were not allowed to hold property or control their own money (there were exceptions to this but usually only for already upper class women). therefore, there was no real way for women to wrench this business back from men. the label of \"chef\" helped the men distance themselves from what was otherwise considered domestic work ,or \"women's work\". women were \"cooks\" in the home, men were \"chefs\" in business.\n\nthis distinction has only recently began to go away.\n\ntl;dr: the advent of the modern restaurant forced women out of their traditional work because of the opportunity for men to make money. those men became \"chefs\", and the women stayed \"cooks\". only now just starting to shift.",
            "Cooking at home is associated with caregiving. You care for your kids, partners, etc. \n\nCooking in a restaurant is associated with making money, and is well known to be a high stress environment. \n\nCaregiving stereotypes are directed at women, while men's sterotypes surrounding being a breadwinner and dealing better with stress.",
            "I assume it's because home cooking is seen as more of a chore, and being the head of a prestigious restaurant is a respected profession.   \nBack in the day people used to believe women shouldn't work, but should instead be taking care of the home while the men went off to work.",
            "women traditionally stay at home, hence being a home cook. men traditionally get a profession, and being a chef is a well paying profession.  edit now that this got big: i should have worded it better. it pays well for the type of profession it is. it's a profession that a lot of people love doing. for example, being a plumber pays better but nobody wakes up in the morning happy to be plumbing, ya know. edit 2: alright you nit picking fucks, i meant that very few people would plum for free just because they gain personal enjoyment. many chefs start because they enjoyed cooking.",
            "This is a pattern across many different art forms. More girls than boys take art, music, theater, etc in school, but more men than women become professional artists, musicians, broadway actors, etc. As others have said, it comes from gendered power structures.",
            "It's like that for many things. Gardening and flowers are girly but landscaping and top experts in the field are men. Fashion is girly but top fashion designers are men (Gucci, Ralph Lauren). Child rearing is for women but top childcare experts are men (dr. Gerber, Dr. Sears). \n\nI think ot goes back to when women didn't work so all the professionals in every field were men out of default.",

            "Women are expected to be able to cook because it\u2019s their duty to their families. Chefs are supposed to be artists, something traditionally male oriented. It\u2019s a career.\n\nIt\u2019s stupid",
            "read that somewhere, gist was: because the cooking are different roles here, at home it's the serving (the family/husband) in a restaurant that role is the server (which is stereotypical the female part in a restaurant) while the chef (cooking) is the leader in a kitchen/restaurant",
            "It's a stereotype because it's true. According to the first Google result I lazily pulled up whole searching \"percentage of female chefs\", only 18.7% of chefs and executive chefs were female in 2012. That's four out of five chefs being male, a huge discrepancy.\n\nWhy? That's more speculative, but being a chef is a very different skill-set to being good at cooking. I love cooking at home (I'm female), but would loathe running a commercial kitchen. Because the cooking's only part of it, and the rest is managing staff, running a physically demanding, high-pressure, competitive, somewhat physically dangerous job with write an aggressive culture (lots of shouting, swearing and general motivation-by-abuse) with hours that don't mesh well with having a family life. I imagine it psychologically appeals to men more than women on average, just by the nature of the beast. And that's OK.\n\nAs for cooking at home being a female-dominated activity, 70% of women cooked a home in 2018 as opposed to 46% of men (again, first result of low-effort googling). So the stereotype is less accurate - men cooking at home is on the rise - but still not entirely wrong.\n\nThe reason for that is probably historical - throughout history women tended to stay around the house more, taking care of the children, while the men worked inside or outside the home at a more specialised task (being a cobbler, lawyer, blacksmith or what-have you). It just makes sense that the person who was in proximity to the kitchen, and had the time to prepare food, would do it. \n\nAnd in many cases, historically, it wasn't a simple as home cook vs chef. Farming women would often earn money though food preparation, making cheeses and preserves to sell, winning prizes for their signature dishes at the county fair, or taking in boarders. \n\nAs women entered the workforce the idea that a wife 'should' cook has persisted, even when it makes little sense because she's out of the house as much as her husband. But that's changing, and fairly rapidly, these days - although it's worth mentioning that even working women generally work fewer hours than working men, on average.",
            "I'm going to replace the word \"chef\" with \"cook\" to answer part of this question.\n\nThe majority of cooks, myself included, come from rough or self-destructive backgrounds. Addicts, alcoholics, convicts, etc. The majority of these cooks are male; not entirely sure why, but I like to think that its a community that is more welcoming to those who have been through the same shit and are just trying to get through life while females in the same boat tend to have other options. Also, the background check to be a cook is almost non-existent. Statistically there are a lot more men with criminal records than women. A lot of these cooks do fall in love with it and end up going on to become chefs with a good salary instead of living paycheck to paycheck.\n\nThat's just my guess though.\n\nAs far as women in the kitchen at home: 1950's TV and years and years of women being told \"you don't need to work, stay at home and raise the kids and make dinner\" is my best guess.",
            "The word Chef comes from French and means boss, the same etymological root as chief. We live in a world which has been traditionally dominated by men. Think of any profession, music for example-: what is the ratio of men to women you think of if you were to name musicians?",

            "Cooking in the home is the responsibility of the home maker as the breadwinner has neither the time nor energy to both work all day and then come home and cook.  Since homemaking is traditionally a female occupation, cooking in the home is associated with women.  \n\nCheffing  (if that's not a word, it is now!) is a profession that pays and work outside the home has been traditionally a male occupational thus is associated with men.\n\nNot that women HAVE to he homemakers any more than men HAVE to have a profession outside the home.  Some women make excellent chefs and some men make excellent homemakers.  It's taken ~10,000 years for these stereotypes to develop, it probably won't take that long to change them, but it certainly won't happen overnight.",
            "Here in South Louisiana a large percentage of men cook at home. Cajun progressivism!",
            "Easy, men throughout history have been known as the cooks in a household or in business and shared it equally with women at home. Mostly women did it at home because men would be out laboring all day, and it was team work. \n\nFast forward to the 40-50s and the economy was so good women no longer had to work and its was something to brag about if you where a stay at home wife, straight up women aspired to to longer toil and be home seamstresses and doing crafts to make more money, they wanted to be a stay at home wife and mother, it was a sign of wealth.

Go to a mom and pop spot, your meal is possibly cooked by a woman.  She's not going to be wearing a chefs coat and have tattoos.\n\nAs for that, we have Escoffier to thank.  He's the godfather of modern cooking and modeled his hotel brigade system after a French military model, as he had served as an army cook for several years.

            "Here's a short story answer:\n\nOnce upon a time someone had a mother and this mother could cook really good....eggs, or pork or something. She learned to cook when she was a child and fortunately for her, made the chore more interesting by trying out different different ways of making certain dishes. Maybe she had a garden or maybe there was wild game brought to her to cook--whatever, over time she become very accomplished at cooking yummy things for her family and community. One day  she needed extra money and decided to make some lamb balls to sell at the market. It went really well, she sold all her balls. After that, she continued to go and sell these balls at the market every week.\n\nThen one day she was old but people STILL wanted these special lamb balls she made. She taught her son how to make them and he started selling them. But over time he realized it was boring and what she was charging wasn't enough. He raised the price. Then he got his wife to make her special cow dick soup and everyone loved it so he started selling that. The whole family--all his children became involved in making these foods. Who was the cook? Who was the \"Chef\" ? The cooks were his family--his mother and wife and children, he was the chef. And maybe he did invent some dish or something along the way. Customers subconsciously believed because he was man and because he involved himself the lowly practice of food making then it must be for a good reason--these lamb balls and dick soup must the best in the market because there was a man involved. Without him the family actually would have sold a lot less balls and dick.\n\nThere may have been chefs since Roman times but they were probably just servants. When someone has been taught to do something from a young age and they continue doing it they usually get fairly adept at it. Chefs were merely a consequence of men monetizing the well crafted recipes of their female relatives and selling it at markets and eventually restaurants.",
            "No clue. My dad (ASE cetified Master Machinist) did all the cooking when I was growing up. Those phrases such as \"like mom used to make\" would gross me out because back then my mom didn't cook very well (she cooks way better now that she's retired).",
            "The main reason goes back quite a while. Rumor has it is that you need an education to become a chef while women stayed home and cooked for the children. This originated quite a while back and stuck around up untill modern times.",
            "Since when is staying at home and cooking a female stereotype? 50 years ago? I am 35 and that thing is looong gone. I know zero families like this. It isn't even that common in people my parents age. People my grandparents age it was. And I grew up in a rural area.",
            "You're asking why men work and women stay home?  It's an outdated concept these days, but being a chef is a job, women stay and home and do chores, including cooking.",
            "Because humanity is full of double standards and a chef is perceived as a professional and a home cook is perceived as an amateur and unfortunately society has portrayed women as second class humans and therefore less important and inferior when in reality they are far better and much more capable than most men and most importantly we all come from a woman literally.",

Red blood cells have no nucleus, so no nuclear DNA (the preferred DNA for testing) . Same for platelets. If you are testing crime scene blood for DNA, you would likely be building your profile based on white blood cells, which are rarely transfused. Plasma usually has some DNA fragments floating around in it from cells that have died and broken down, but not really enough to build a robust profile.   \n\n\nIn short, if someone got a blood transfusion and somehow felt well enough to immediately go out killing, the DNA test would likely just come back inconclusive and you would not be a suspect.",

So keeping this in mind a person would more than likely not be out of the hospital till they made sure the transfusion went through fine (there was no rejection of the blood). In this case they would more than likely not be able to commit a murder.\n\nIf hypothetically they were transfused with your blood and it was just the one unit and they could get out of the hospital in time to murder and they leave evidence. \nIf it\u2019s just the one unit then there is the small chance with the shortest window that a person could leave evidence; let\u2019s say they bleed somewhere in the scene. \n\nA blood transfusion bag is packed red blood cells (they take out everything else); to be able to tell DNA on a cell you need a MHC (major histocompatibility complex), which the red blood cells do not have, meaning there is nothing to link back to DNA wise. \n\n\nBut could they link back to the blood type?\nAlso no. Why? \n\nWhen someone is transfused the facilities (unless In emergency situations) will give you a blood compatibility test. They\u2019re going to try to give you the same blood type (A,B,O,AB); if there is an emergency you\u2019ll receive O-.\n\nNow if the latter happens, a person receive emergency blood of O-, and it happens to be yours and that person who was transfused was magically able to even move after this, then the person will not test for both types. They will keep their own blood type. \n\nBut if it\u2019s a MASSIVE transfusion (10 unites of blood, 10 full bags) meaning the patience blood is literally replaced. This means if a person originally had blood type A, they\u2019re not going to test this way anymore.

The reason there is can be rejection of blood or organs is because the body doesn't recognise the blood/ organs as its own and sends its T-cells to fight it off so unless the blood/ cells aren't close in the first place (e.g. The same blood type) it would be a struggle for it to be accepted in the first place and could lead to more complex problems with murder being the least of their concerns. After the body \"accepts\" the transfusion the blood will no longer be the same as its mixed with the hosts blood, the transfused blood won't even become noticeable. Think of it as putting a drop of salt water into a cup of drinking water, most likely you won't even notice.

Assuming you have donated one liter of blood, your blood would make up between only 1/4-1/7th of the recipient's total volume.\n\n\nNot only would the donor center separate the components, removing plasma and other coagulation factors, but most blood products are leukocyte or white cell reduced. \n\n\nRed cells aren't generally what is being used to ID from crime scenes, it's actually trace genetic material amplified from the white cells in whole blood.\n\n\nAnd this isn't really my wheelhouse, but from taking a couple of forensics classes as electives: Most genetic testing used in a court of law is generally going to be based off of mitochondrial DNA amplified from white blood cells, since it's traits are known to be inheritable familially, or from other sort of tissue cell, like squamous epithelial cells.",

            "Dear Reddit Community,\n\nIt is with a heavy heart that I write this farewell message to express my reasons for departing from this platform that has been a significant part of my online life. Over time, I have witnessed changes that have gradually eroded the welcoming and inclusive environment that initially drew me to Reddit. It is the actions of the CEO, in particular, that have played a pivotal role in my decision to bid farewell.\n\nFor me, Reddit has always been a place where diverse voices could find a platform to be heard, where ideas could be shared and discussed openly. Unfortunately, recent actions by the CEO have left me disheartened and disillusioned. The decisions made have demonstrated a departure from the principles of free expression and open dialogue that once defined this platform.\n\nReddit was built upon the idea of being a community-driven platform, where users could have a say in the direction and policies. However, the increasing centralization of power and the lack of transparency in decision-making have created an environment that feels less democratic and more controlled.\n\nFurthermore, the prioritization of certain corporate interests over the well-being of the community has led to a loss of trust. Reddit's success has always been rooted in the active participation and engagement of its users. By neglecting the concerns and feedback of the community, the CEO has undermined the very foundation that made Reddit a vibrant and dynamic space.\n\nI want to emphasize that this decision is not a reflection of the countless amazing individuals I have had the pleasure of interacting with on this platform. It is the actions of a few that have overshadowed the positive experiences I have had here.\n\nAs I embark on a new chapter away from Reddit, I will seek alternative platforms that prioritize user empowerment, inclusivity, and transparency. I hope to find communities that foster open dialogue and embrace diverse perspectives.\n\nTo those who have shared insightful discussions, provided support, and made me laugh, I am sincerely grateful for the connections we have made. Your contributions have enriched my experience, and I will carry the memories of our interactions with me.\n\nFarewell, Reddit. May you find your way back to the principles that made you extraordinary.\n\nSincerely,\n\nNABDad",

It's much more difficult to even crack a guess at what's going on, much less be certain about it, and much much less know wtf you should do about it.\n\nThe difference between being smart in a controlled academic setting and in a real world setting is the difference between being able to draw one specific thing well and being able to draw anything well.\n\nThere's a big difference between knowing a lot of stuff and being good at thinking. What matters is not what or how much data you have but what decisions you make. Decisionmaking requires reasoning with what you know, and what you can do with your reasoning is the true root of intellect, not knowledge. If being smart is cooking, then knowledge is just what ingredients you have on hand. Be good enough of a cook and you can make anything work.",

They do this by talking constantly about the various surface knowledge they have thus leading you to believe they have a lot of knowledge. Odds are they're not that much smarter than you and just desperately crave validation by making you think they are. The fact that they also avoid talking about things they have nothing to say on (or find a way of talking a lot without actually saying anything substantive, I've known a lot like that) means it seems like they have something to say about everything, whereas you know just how much subject matter there is that you're completely vacuous on\n\nAlso when you don't know about something, anyone who *seems* to know about it seems smart, even when they're speaking total bullshit, because how would you know? When I was in university I was surrounded by people who made me feel inferior with all the stuff I didn't know but they did, but then I came to realise, I didn't know much about computer science, that's why I was there, to study it, so I couldn't tell that everything they were saying was a load of crap. The difference between us was that they were confident enough to talk about it despite knowing nothing and I wasn't, and since confident people naturally attract unconfident people they therefore end up with an entourage of people like me who felt intellectually inferior to them. This boosts their ego and teaches them \"If I talk about how much I know then they will love me, even if I know nothing, because this whole demographic is by definition people who don't know enough to tell me I'm wrong, that's why they're studying the subject\". It's not necessarily a malicious thing they do, they just get conditioned to talk like this all the time\n\nDuring work, however, people are there to do their job, get paid and go home, so they don't really want to spend hours showcasing how much they know unless it's relevant. They probably don't want to seek validation, hell they probably don't want to be here at all. They want to do this thing they're likely only doing because they have to do it to survive then get back to their own personal lives, so all you'll tend to hear them talk about is work, if anything. The result of this is that they'll seem like they don't have much going on in their heads besides \"turn up, do job, get paid, go home\" whereas you know how much you have going on in your own head and so feel like a deep, complex, interesting person by comparison\n\nIf you get to know the people at university then you can often come to the realisation that most of the people you liked are full of shit and if you get to know the people at work you come to realise they have led full lives that have given them some interesting thoughts and informed their world view. Some people at university are genuinely smart, interesting people and some at work are genuinely just idiots, but the different environments tend to bring different parts of their personality into the face they show to the world (I believe the Japanese call this your *tatamae*). When surrounded by people pursuing an education in an environment you want to be in you'll want to seem interesting and intellectual, when surrounded by people doing a job they may very well hate in an environment they're forced to be in you'll want to do the deed and be done with it (the whole \"keep your personal and professional lives separate\" thing, terrible advice that only benefits your employer, and even then only if you're easy to replace because now you can lift right out)\n\nTL;DR: Intellectualism breeds elitism, labour breeds boredom",

In the US, the HS graduation rate is ~85% and the % of graduates attending college is ~70%.  So overall, about 60% of HS students attend college, and that obviously tends to be the smarter 60%.  A job, depending on your field, will likely expose you to a much more representative sample of intelligences.\n\nBut there are other effects as well.  While the students at a middle-of-the-road college might be a bit smarter than average, the professors there are *much* smarter than average, many of them having themselves graduated from top institutions.  And it's the faculty that largely sets the tone and culture of the college.  Also, being smart is rewarded pretty directly in college, so people will try to be smarter or at least act smarter.  This is much less the case in industry as a whole.\n\nThere's also the fact that college curricula has often been developed over literally hundreds of years, so there's a very well designed and tested formula for people to follow for their work.

            "Because it psychologically tricks your mind into thinking you will pay less money to buy something than you actually have to.\n\nThis is the main reason. Period. Yes, it is more work for stores and companies, yes, it's complicated because of the different state and county tax rules, and yes, there are a few places here and there which do include the tax in the price, but those aren't the main reasons.\n\nThe main reason is it tricks your primitive simian mind into thinking you are going to spend less money than you actually will.\n\nThe only way most retailers would include sales tax to price tags is if it were made law, and I'm sure all the local chambers of commerce would lobby against it with all the money they could muster.",
            "Just in case nobody mentioned it yet, some totally do, even in America.  AFAIK there's no law or rule against it, or even any official convention.  Usually very small shops, tourist places like beachside souvenir stands and other places where very high volume sales or limited cash register support are expected, as well as many small restaurants, like sandwich shops, cafes or delicatessens.  If you expect to be selling a lot, being in a hurry when making payment, or don't expect to have more than (or as much as) a calculator to help get it right - or you expect your salesperson to be an inexperienced teenager who will mess it up and cost you money - you often do add the tax to the price.\n\nBut it is uncommon because higher pricetags = lower sales, period, to one extent or another, pure Human psychology.",
            "Take the Jc Penny sale model for instance. JCP comes out and says hey everyone we are no longer having anymore sales ( the entire store is a sale) and instead giving you the upfront and honest price. This back fired drastically and caused them to lose. \n\n [Forbes article ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2017/02/24/a-strategic-mistake-that-still-haunts-jc-penney/amp/)",
            "Sales taxes have always been the province of the states. There has never been a national sales tax or VAT*. \n\nJust because states *can* have sales tax, doesn't mean they're *required* to. As of today, Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire and Oregon don't have sales tax. So yes, you pick a $10 pack of socks off the shelf in one of those states, and it's $10 at the til.\n\n5 states not having sales tax means that 45 states do. Two things to consider here:\n\nIn sales tax states, either the legislature or a tax commission sets a state-wide rate, say 5%. Most sales tax states allow counties and cities to levy taxes on top of that. In some cases (like to build and maintain public transportation systems), those taxes are permanent. In other cases (such as building *x* number of schools, or to build a specific set of roads) the taxes may be temporary: the county sells bonds to get the money for the project, then levies a 1-2% sales tax for 5-10 years specifically to pay the bonds off. Once they're paid off, that tax goes away. Point is, in most metropolitan areas, sales tax can vary from county to county and city to city. Sales tax is 7% at my nearest convenience store. If I drive a few minutes east, into the next county, it's 8.25%. If I drive a few minutes south, into South Carolina, it's 6.5%.\n\nBut wait... there's more! Sales taxes are regressive, meaning they affect people with lower incomes more than people with high incomes. So if Bill Gates and I walked in to my local Microsoft Store and bought the exact same laptop, the $50-$75 we'd pay in sales tax is a lot more of my income than his income.\n\nTo balance this, many states have concessions in sales tax. Many of these concessions started during the Great Depression, and were very simple: if it was a grocery store and you wanted to buy something most people considered \"food\", it was tax-free. But sales taxes on groceries are one of a state's most reliable revenue streams, so in time many states introduced low levels of tax on groceries, like 1%. After 10-15 years, once people were used to paying 1%, many states bumped it up to 2%. By the 1960s and 1970s, states realized that they couldn't raise rates any more, so in some states they adopted a tiered system: a \"tax free\\2% rate\" for basic foodstuffs like fresh meat, diary, fruits and vegetables and a \"higher rate\\full rate\" for prepared foods, like ready meals, frozen pizzas, etc. Nowadays, social engineers are trying all kinds of things, like levying additional taxes on \"bad\" foods (like soda) or \"bad\" packaging (like plastic). On top of all that, farmers in many states still have lots of power - I don't think it ever became law, but the last time Georgia overhauled the sales tax system, pecan and peanut farmers fought hard to make their products tax-free, while (out-of-state) almonds and cashews would have been taxed at the 2-3% rate.\n\nAll this is to say that, in many cases, people DON'T KNOW what the tax rate even is. In some states, flour, sugar and salt aren't taxed, but if you measure them out and put them in a box and call it \"cake mix\", they are. One state (Indiana?) taxes candy, but doesn't tax Twix and Kit Kat bars because they contain flour. North Carolina has a pretty simple system, but when I go to a Walmart Supercenter, I might have in my cart a hammer (7%), a frozen dinner (3%) and a pack of pork chops (2%). So it can get confusing.\n\nIf you enjoy reading legislation (and there *are* such people in the world), you might want to look at the rules NC used to use for their Sales Tax Holiday. In August, many states have sales tax holidays, so parents can buy their kids clothing and school supplies for the upcoming year and not have to pay sales tax on it. NC got rid of theirs a few years ago, but it was fun to read the rules on clothing tax: it was clear the NC legislature wanted to give families a break on sales tax on clothes *but* didn't want rich people using it as an excuse to empty the racks at the Chanel store. So the sales tax rules on jackets was something like \"no sales tax on jackets under $100, unless it's considered a 'parka' in which case the exemption is $250, or unless it's a 100% wool 'pea coat', in which case the exemption is $215\". Same with shoes: \"the exemption is $125, unless they're work boots, in which case it's $200\". Stuff like that.\n\n\\* - There are federal excise taxes on things like alcohol, tobacco, gasoline and airline tickets... but these are almost always included in the listed price. A bottle of Irish whiskey might be \"$25 + local sales tax\". It *won't* be \"$10 base price + $10 federal excise tax + $5 state excise tax + sales tax\".\n\nEDIT: Fixed typo\n\nEDIT: Obligatory \"thanks for the gold!\" comment!",
            "Because US States are actually like individual EU countries.\n\nUS States are similar in size, population, and GDP to the average EU country. They are nearly autonomous entities actually, but they aren't individually sovereign.\n\nWe had a war about this actually. It's what the US Civil War was about.\n\nYes, it was primarily about  slavery, but the basis of that argument was the North saying \"You have to free the slaves now because we made a federal law that says so\" and the South basically replied \"Eat a dick. We're sovereign entities and you don't have that authority.\"\n\nThen the North said \"Yeah, we do\" with infantry and cannons.\n\nAnd the South said \"Nuh-uh\" with their own infantry and cannons.\n\nThe North had more money and won the argument.\n\nAt any rate, we don't have a uniform national tax law because of how states are structured. We do have some federal taxes, but things like sales tax and such are State level, not national.\n\nEach State has its own laws, tax systems, and law enforcement. They even have their own military as each state's National Guard answers to the State Governor and not the President the US.\n\nThis means they each have their own taxes and how they go about collecting them.\n\nThis can even vary as locally as county or city taxes in some cases.\n\nThey also have open borders and trade. You can cross state lines without having to deal with a border checkpoint. So trade travels freely.\n\nBasically, while taxes may remain the same in one place for decades at a time, a tax law somewhere in the US changes every single day.\n\nRather than deal with this, most retailers just don't bother adding taxes to the sale price because things like marketing and shipping are often national.

Think of it this way: if one shop advertises a price of $22 tax added, and another shop advertises a price of $21 plus tax, people will buy the $21 item. Despite the fact that most states will have a sales tax of at least 5%, making the $21 item more expense ($22.05). \n\nAnother part of it is it helps price smaller items. People want to SEE things to be priced like $1 for a candy bar, not $1.05. Well, if you show it priced it as $1 tax added, then the store has to eat the tax. If you show it as a $1 plus tax, suddenly it's the government's fault that it's not a dollar, cause that's all the merchant gets.\n\nAt small values is annoying, at larger values, suddenly the $2000 budget for new furniture is blown because you found a great deal at $1950 but then you forgot tax but then you already love it and oh well let's just get it anyway.",

            "A huge reason that a quick scan of the answers shows people are neglecting to mention (or aren\u2019t realizing) is tax varies so much by location. Not just state to state but even city to city within states. \n\nWhen shopping within the EU you know you have 21% VAT so that\u2019s just included to the price of the item. In order to do that here, each individual store in each city would have to adjust their prices based on their location, which gets even tricker when you get into online stores. \n\nWhen buying online, you pay tax based on where YOU are. So as an American who often purchases from the EU, my prices are actually 21% cheaper than listed. If I were an American living in Oregon or Delaware, where there is no sales tax, my prices are as is shopping online. If I live somewhere like Seattle where tax is upwards of 10%, that\u2019s what I\u2019m charged. And it would be difficult to adjust the prices as necessary on sites for big national or international retailers such as Target or Macy\u2019s. \n\nOn top of ALL OF that, there are certain items that aren\u2019t taxed at all. \n\nBasically, America is the Wild West of taxation and while what you suggest is a great idea in theory, it won\u2019t work in practice, unfortunately.",
            "In many states it is illegal to incorporate the sales tax into the marked price.  The rationale is that the consumer should know what they are paying for the item and what they are paying in tax.  It stems from a greater general hostility to taxation in the US and the feeling of some that if the tax were incorporated into the price people would be less aware and more accepting of it.  It is the same reason why gasoline pumps in the U.S.  have the state and local gas taxes amounts displayed on the pump.",
            "There's 2 reasons why stores in the U.S dont include sales tax in the marked price. First, sales taxes are different among the States and some local jurisdictions have an additional sales tax. Many items for sale are prepriced. A national company wouldnt be able to preprice things because the final price would be different everywhere because of the different tax rates. \n\nSecondly, in the U.S., we try to make taxes as transparent as possible. By keeping sales taxes seperated from the retail price, people in the U.S. can keep tabs on what our govt is taxing us. \n\nPeople in countries that use the VAT type of tax dont ever realize how much their govt is taxing them because the tax is hidden in tje price.",

            "OP sounds female or very young, which is understandable.  Bo- er, excuse me, *erections* are like tea leaves.  You can interpret them all you want, but the true meaning will always be opaque.  Tumesence can happen because:\n\n* The man is aroused\n* The man is chilly\n* The man is warm\n* The man has to urinate, perhaps urgently, perhaps not.\n* The man had a sensual (not necessarily erotic) dream\n* It is morning and Testosterone is peaking\n* Pick up to any 3 of the above at once, or not\n\nI'll admit, for much of a man's life, especially the younger parts, erections aren't too complicated, and may be predictable or easy to understand.  But they *can* be complex, every bit as much as the female orgasm.  So try not to read too much into the presence, or absence of an erection in any given circumstance.  All it means is that a certain nerve got stimulated and blood flow happened.  You have to talk to the owner to find out if sensuality / eroticism / arousal had anything to do with it, because you can't be certain any other way.\n\nLikewise - and this is much more often talked about - the *lack* of one when you might expect it isn't necessarily simple to interpret, either.  Don't assume that the lack of one in intimate circumstances means a lack of desire.  Could be a lot of things getting in the way, mostly psychological and far too diverse to list.  Again, you gotta talk, openly and honestly, to the owner.",

(She had a lot of misguided views based on a very conservative upbringing) We talked through that over time, and I explained that it was a natural reaction to laying up against a beautiful woman who I was in love with. it took a little bit for her to change her way of thinking about it but eventually she got to a point where she was flattered by it instead of it bothering her. Back in those early days, I would just turn a little bit to where it wasn\u2019t as obvious to her. Nowadays there are still times where it is just physically uncomfortable for her to have something poking her in the back while she\u2019s trying to relax, So in those rare cases she will just let me know and I will move accordingly.

If a person is cuddling with a child or family member then getting aroused would be highly unusual and very inappropriate. Now let's talk consenting adults... Personally I find that cuddling is a very intimate activity, even if its platonic. So I can't imagine being that intimate with someone who I'd be totally freaked out of they got a boner. If I have a sexual relationship with the person, awesome. If not, just laugh it off and continue to enjoy your cuddles.

So there's also not necessarily an automatic physical reaction.\n\nSo, as a man in his mid-to-late 30's, I do not get a boner when i cuddle with someone in general, no... If it is someone i'm romantically involved with, it could happen, but it'll depend a lot on the situation. If it's just a cuddle while watching a movie, for instance, I typically wouldn't, cause my brain is not immediately going to \"oh cuddle = sex\". \n\nThere's involuntary boners that can happen at any time, which could just as well happen during cuddling. If it would during a cuddle with a romantic partner, I'd expect we both would be mature enough not to care. Or otherwise, when i feel it coming on (it's not like a boner is there in a flash), I'd move my crotch away from the other person to cause less discomfort, or just disengage the cuddle.",

            "As a European: I think on average Canadians are more \"polite nice\" and Americans are more \"enthusiastic nice\". Both can be equally fake or real, but American expression is much more on the extravert side of the scale. Compared to most European types of body language and tone of voice, American expression comes across as kinda over the top. Canadian is a bit closer to most European styles.\n\n(Can't speak for other continents).\n\nEdit: I feel like this might need the disclaimer that obviously this is based on my individual experience with individual Americans and Canadians and as such should never be taken as scientific fact.",
            "American niceness is often very upfront and obvious, which to the sensibilities of many europeans can seem fake because that's not really what they do. \n\nBut remember that this too is something that varies widely from country to country. It's not like everywhere in Europe has the same standards of politeness. Politeness in the UK is very different from politeness in Italy.",
            "Well...I can\u2019t speak for everyone and when I was in New York I always thought that people were being genuinely nice, just as people from Canada (Montreal) or London.\n\nBut for example:\nI had guests over (I\u2019m Austrian my guests were Canadian and from Florida) and I like all of them a lot, had a great evening. But I did notice one thing: compliments.\nThe American guy was all like: The wine is amazing. The food is absolutely delicious. The music is awesome.\nThe Canadians were a lot more subtle, liking a lot and only really loving one or two things.\n\nI don\u2019t think my American guest was being any less genuine but as a European who isn\u2019t used to this kind of very \u201ebig\u201c compliments, gestures and reactions it kind of felt weird sometimes.  But well, it\u2019s just another way of talking so I just try to adjust my way of thinking \ud83d\ude05 (and really I do the same when going to Italy...cultures just have different ways of talking)",
            "I can't speak to the Canadian part, but as an American I have spent a lot of time in Europe and I think I understand the problem we have. \n\nAmericans and Europeans have different social behavior norms. Normal American behavior doesn't fit the European norms. It comes across as very friendly in some respects, signaling close friendship, and not very friendly in others. Consequently, Europeans interpret Americans as shallow. Similarly, Americans interpret normal European stranger behavior as rude.",
            "I live in Scotland and I can say that most people I know don't really have much of an opinion on Canadians one way or the other. We certainly don't encounter them as much as we do Americans, whether that's in person or on TV etc. I'd also say that people would mostly assume Canadians are American due to the accent unless they have a very stereotypical canadian accent (and even then, lots of people wouldn't know what that sounded like either). So to me, that contrast between Americans and Canadians does not exist. We don't have enough exposure to Canadians (or simply don't recognise them as being Canadian).\n\nRegarding the fakeness from Americans - a lot of what I'd call fakeness would be encountered from people providing a service, like waitresses/waiters in restaurants having a huge smile for you when you enter, and asking how your day has been. I would perceive that sort of question as rhetorical and I wouldn't actually expect them to care how my day has been. I'd expect them to be acting that way because they have been told to. My opinion is that the truth of it is probably somewhere in the middle; partly down to cultural differences where we just don't really act that way here, and partly down to what I said above.\n\nI wouldn't really think your average person on the street, or someone in a uni class with you, being nice in this way was being fake. If someone in these situations is being nice i'd take it at face value.",
            "Italian here: literally the first time I hear about this. The stereotype here is that Canadians are \"polite nice\" (keeping the door open, apologizing, etc) and Americans are \"loud nice\" (complimenting a lot, being touchy, exaggerating enthusiasm). The \"fake nice\" stereotype is usually for the Japanese.\n\nEDIT: Yes, I meant shoulder pats, but I was also just describing the general feel of the \"excessive American who knows no boundaries\" stereotype, not making an analysis of actual facts. A lot of national stereotypes do not come from any real observation of actual facts.",
            "Honestly I got frustrated at times as an American living abroad. People would think I was being \u201cfake\u201d when I asked people how they were doing, said hello to people passing by and just smiled/laughed often. I am a positive person, I enjoy being kind and open. And then my classmates would tell me to stop pretending or to just be myself when I would chat up people working or strike up conversations with strangers or even just smile at people passing by. That\u2019s my genuine response!! I\u2019m not being fake!! I just enjoy seeing people happy!!!!",
            "A German acquaintance once remarked to me, \"Man, Americans are so rude.\"\n\n\"Why so?\" I asked.\n\n\"They always ask, 'How are you?' But then when I try to answer them, they don't really care.  They don't really want to hear about my day.\"\n\nI cringed a little bit.  I had to explain to him that in American culture, if you say, \"How are you?\" or \"What's going on?\" that is equivalent to just saying \"Hello.\"   You might hear a short response like \"I'm good, thanks,\" but often we don't even expect a reply.\n\nIt was a case of a cultural mismatch.  My German friend heard the question, 'How are you?' and took it to mean the speaker genuinely wanted to hear the details of how his day was going.\n\nSo on that count, all I can say is 'guilty as charged.'",
            "Speaking as an American, I think that that politeness can be really fake and superficial but I know tons of people are genuinely friendly. The way I understand it is  Europeans are less in your face friendly than Americans. It's more common that a American would chat up a stranger they don't know than many Europeans. So maybe it's just a cultural difference that comes off as fake or strange. Idk for sure but that's what Ive heard from Europeans about friendliness.",
            "kazakhs will force gifts on you, almost all asian peoples will fight over who pays for the meal, and none probably actually want to. Nobody looks on them as fools. Its just a north american custom.",
            "I've lived in the US for a few years and I'm definitely aware of this, mostly by its absence when I travel somewhere else. I'm not a linguist and I may be misusing some terms but I have a different theory about what's going on.\n\nAmerican english uses a different register when speaking to strangers, or when working in customer service: basically in any context where you are trying to make the other person feel like they have high status. It's generally a higher pitch, the use of stock greetings, etc.\n\nThe other place I've seen this is Japan, where customer service workers will use a formal register that would come across as very fake and distant among friends.\n\nIn Canada and Australia this is way less common (other than when required by, say, a franchise store).\n\nTo me, it feels extremely hard to switch to friendly conversation with an American using this formal voice, because it sounds like they're trying hard to be polite.  It's much easier to tell if an Australian or Canadian is interested in conversation or just being polite.\n\nI don't see this as \"fake\" politeness at all. I think it's a subtle miscommunication and intended to be appropriate and respectful.",
            "When i started working in London hospitality as an American, there were times i would end up in tears because people thought i was making fun of them or being fake. But on the flip side, i now realize there were many times british people were horribly rude to me and i just didnt realize because my brain wasnt wired for British snark\n\nEdit: This comment has generated a lot of conversation! As someone who has now been in the UK for over four years, i am proud to say that i do understand banter and feel that i have assimilated well into British/European norms. This comment was just meant for when I was 18 and waitressing in posh Hampstead. Nowadays it isn't much like that anymore :)",
            "Soooo you know the term \"emotional labour\"? I'm sure you've heard of it, but the term has gotten away from its original meaning. It's this notion that your job makes you do work with your emotions in addition to the actual work you're doing. A common example of this is the idea that the lady working the check-out at the grocery store is still expected to be sweet and chipper and nice to everyone, even though her mom just died. She has to do additional *emotional* work in order to appear happy to the customers, even though she's obviously not at all happy.\n\nI think *this* is why American niceness is seen as fake. Emotional labour exists in all jobs and in all countries, to some degree or another, but it exists to an unusually high degree in the US. While many countries just expect employees (especially customer-facing ones) to just *not* be cold, Americans typically expect employees to be actively warm. I remember seeing a joke a while back from some Brits who were laughing at this American expectation that employees are supposed to smile all the time - they were saying that, if the guy checking tickets on the train was smiling, they'd assume he'd completely lost his mind, not that he was happy; of *course* he's not happy, that's a pretty shit job to have to do. It comes across as extremely bizarre to them that, in the US, that employee would probably be expected to smile. And I think this notion really bleeds into the general perception of Americans among people from other countries.\n\nBut like... Canada actually *does* have similar expectations of warmth from customer service people. It's a very similar culture in the US in that way. So why our niceness is considered genuine... I honestly don't know. There's a pretty good chance that this is just stereotyping. We enjoy a truly ridiculous reputation for being super nice people, so nobody *looks* for a reason to explain why we're smiling. I dunno, lol.",
            "I think in America its almost considered rude to not be overly polite and \"sunny.\" That's why it can feel fake, its almost required so it doesn't mean much when its there so its harder to tell if its genuine from the outside.",
            "My guess is that they're responding to some subtle nonverbal differences between Canadian and American communication styles.  I'm a Canadian citizen from British Columbia currently living in California, and I've noticed that Americans tend to sustain eye contact longer than I'm used to, and also touch their conversational partner much more often. Also, there's a difference in asking for something - Canadians tend to ask (and criticise!) more indirectly.",
            "Niceness even in the US varies by definition... southerns are notorious for considering northerners rude and (I\u2019m southern by birth) when I lived up north, people thought I was super smart mouthed because I said ma\u2019am or sir after every yes and no.",
            "I think there\u2019s a general assumption that it isn\u2019t socially accepted in the US to express negative emotions. \nIt\u2019s part of the social code and you have to \u2018leave your problems at home\u2019. \nThere\u2019s less of a disconnect in Europe between home and public / professional life.",
            "American niceness is considered fake?  I had no idea.  That is kind of a bummer.  I tend to be nice and positive to everyone all the time.  I'm not fake.",
            "For me (an Irish person) American niceness is usually more intense, like a Labrador puppy or Jim Carey \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 it\u2019s very strong so can seem odd or put on even if it\u2019s completely genuine. Canadian niceness is usually more demure/polite/apologetic so it\u2019s less intense or intimidating.",
            "I think the stereotype of Canadians being nice, comes from Americans, not Europeans.",
            "Interestingly, the Armchair Experts podcast interviewed Erin Meyer this week, and the topic of cultural differences in friendliness came up. Americans' friendship/niceness seems fake because they're so open about themselves when you first meet them. But at the end of a conversation, they're happy to just walk away and never see you again.  So with some European cultures they feel a bit misled because they are more reserved and do not open up until there is more of a relationship.",
            "I'm British but my wife is Canadian and we spend a lot of time in Canada.\n\nThe Canadian stereotype of politiesnss is entirely false. \ud83e\udd23 Their customer service is very good (by UK standards at the very least) so I can see how visitors might experience this more and assume all Canadians are super polite.\n\nBut having got to know the \"real Canada\" (or at least the \"real western Canada\") I can tell you that Canadians are a bunch of truck driving, roundabout hating, hockey fighting, maple drinking d-bags! \ud83e\udd23\n\nDont belive me?

            "Because stereotypes...",
            "It's probably because of the service industry and people depending on tips to get by. On the whole though I've found Americans to be significantly friendlier than Canadians. That might have something to do with Canada being part of the Commonwealth and me being British, so it's not very impressive to them. The US on the other hand are a lot more interested.",
            "I\u2019m in the UK and I\u2019d never picked up on this talking to an American in person, but recently I was put through to phone customer service that was based in America. I spoke to 2 different people and I\u2019m sure they were lovely people but, to me, because they were trying to sound so happy it just sounded like everything they said was sarcastic and it really wound me up.\n(I\u2019m not one to shout over the phone so I didn\u2019t blow up but when I put the phone down I was definitely annoyed haha!)",
            "I'm irish. From personal experience, American pleasantness is over the top, cheesy and just quite clearly forced for the sake of manners, almost rehearsed. Canadian niceness seems more genuine and gentle, from the heart.",
            "I mean, it's a really big country with a wide variety of social cultural norms depending on where you're at. \n\nI'd say anyone who lumps a type of behavior into being representative of 'Americans as a whole' probably is less interested in having a genuine discussion as they are in simplifying a huge and diverse population.\n\nThat goes beyond America as well of course. There's cultural differences even among smaller countries.\n\nBy the way it's Pain Au Chocolat not Chocolatine you fools.",
            "Speaking as an American living in a \"nice \" place, some \"southern charm\" USA is a front - you act nice to everyone, but when it comes down to it, it isn't through and through (racism or just nice to people and gossip about everyone)",
            "I think they're both fake, but I also don't think it's necessarily bad to show interest in your fellow humans, even if you don't care that much. I'm from the Midwest but now live in the South. I grew up with a much more subdued form of politeness. A smile and nod as opposed to a \"Hey!!! How y'all doin' today?!!!!\"\n\nThey're the same thing. Just different ways of expressing it. Same with Canadian politeness or any form of politeness around the world. It's all just shorthand for \"I am not a threat and I wish to have no conflict with you\". Why is it a surprise that different places have different cultural standards for these things? Are Europeans really bothered by this? I'm sure they must understand that different cultures have different ways of expressing themselves and interacting. What does it mean to say it's \"fake\"? Do I care deeply about the personal struggles and triumphs of a stranger I'm standing in line behind in the coffee shop? No, obviously not. But that doesn't mean any interaction with them is fake. It's just the grease that keeps our society running smoothly.",

I don't want to be greated by a badly paid wage slave because he doesn't care if I am there or not. It is not being nice, it is lying to my face. The same thing with the cash out. Why are the people putting staff in my bags? Why is everyone trying to brown nose me? Because they want my money, that's why. It doesn't feel genuine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor context: I am German and Germans are often times seen as cold and somewhat rude.

            "I've heard it best described as cultures can be described as peaches (with soft exteriors, but hard centers) or coconuts (hard exteriors, sweet, soft interiors).\n\nThe American South, for example the peaches, is stereotypically full of individuals who take part in a \"culture of kindness\" superficially only. Anything past that superficiality requires strained effort.\n\nGermans, the coconuts, another group I am familiar with (Northern Germans at least, I don't understand Bavarians - partially joking there) are notoriously difficult to get to know, or \"get in\" with, but once you are part of the \"group\" you're like family.\n\nThat's a really brief, surface overview of those dynamics. A good start to dive deeper, if you wanted to pursue the thought further.\n\nWith all that said, while not 100% relevant, I find Canadians to be a blend of European stereotypes and Southern American stereotypes. (Quebecois are different, and very similar to the German/European type I explained)\n\nEdit: this is all in my experience, of course!",
            "From experience, American politeness comes with a bigger smile and extra words and excessive enunciation. Canadians (and everyone else) just act normal.",
            "Judging from Reddit it\u2019s because people generally have a negative attitude towards Americans and therefore what we do seems negative even if it\u2019s us being polite",
            "Because of the way americans speak.As a european i can't really explain it precisely but there's this 'fake\" \"superficial\" tone that americans have.Of course it's just a feeling we're well aware of that it's just the way you guys speak but it does come off as fake.",
            "I've never heard that.  But okay, Europeans.",
            "I don\u2019t know any Canadians but Americans came across really open and extroverted so they were always talking to us or making jokes or even complementing like a shirt or something on a street which is pretty uncommon in my country. I liked the vibe honestly, I can imagine it can make your life more interesting, getting to know people easier and stuff \n\nBrits on the other hand came of way more polite but reserved at the same time. I visited England for language exchange program and the very first day they showed us an old video of how to act in the UK: please don\u2019t put trash on the street, please don\u2019t walk on the grass, please, don\u2019t be too loud, please don\u2019t speak in your language in public places because grandma will think you\u2019re talking about her, use please and thank you etc. It was so funny to me, almost like they thought we\u2019re some kind of savages and not other Europeans.",
            "To me it's about follow through. I've met a lot of Americans who have been extremely, over the top friendly, and have acted from the moment we met like we're best friends. I have no problem with that, it's kinda sweet! But then they all would do stuff like suggest we hang out more, made rough plans for the future together, made promises etc, and completely flaked on all of them. So to me, that's why Americans come off fake, because they act like they're your friend and wanna hang out, but don't actually follow through with the plans/friendship. I cAnt think of another explanation for behaviour like that, that doesn't make the person doing it seem kinds fake/phoney in their friendly gestures and mannerisms.\n\nCanadians seem slightly more reserved and do tend to be more polite and genuine about following through, but I haven't met as many Canadians so it's harder to be definitive.",
            "American niceness is very upfront. Saying hello on the street, making conversation for no reason other than to talk, random compliments, etc. Canadian niceness is more of actions rather than words. People holding the door for you when you arent even at the door yet and they dont even expect you to rush because Canadians are just used to doing that for people. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n(this message brought to you by a Canadian, who used to travel to the USA a lot before the world ended)",
            "Because we say things like \u201cBless your heart\u201d which translates into \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot\u201d.",
            "Most of Europe simply does not like Americans, especially big places-to-visit countries like Britain, France, or Germany; it's harder to be given the benefit of the doubt by people who don't like you.\n\nHere in Norway we really like Americans, though - so we consider American niceness to be genuine and friendly.",
            "Most of the Canadians I\u2019ve met were ass holes.\n\nOn the other hand, Mexicans are some of the friendliest people I\u2019ve met in North America.",
            "American niceness tends to be the kind that will ask you about your day and offer you a cup of coffee if you visit, or maybe even help you change a flat tire, and then turn around and vote to ensure you can never afford healthcare and that your student loans will suffocate you to the point of suicide. But the niceness will give some thoughts and prayers at the funeral and talk about how there was nothing anyone could have done. American niceness is saying \"There's a reason for everything\" after your child dies of cancer. It's a smile that will drive you to the airport while secretly thinking you're going to burn in hell for eternity because you're attracted to the same sex. Not everyone, obviously, but the difference is the US is individualistic, and replete with crabs in a bucket spite and schadenfreude, and a general undercurrent that people get what they deserve. It's a country that will donate $10 on gofundme for your insulin while clinging to the $5 in taxes that would let you just go get insulin.\n\nIt feels fake because by and large it's shallow and void of authenticity. Just like television news stories about a kid working all summer to pay the lunch debt of the other kids at school. It's only nice on the surface, a whitewashed tomb.\n\nThe upshot is that the number of authentically nice ones seem to be growing. Perhaps in a few generations the overall tone will shift.",
            "Speaking as an American with lots of ties to Canada who has travelled a lot: Canadians are typically nice and the niceness is genuine. They're more likely to help if you have a need, less likely to take advantage of you if you have a vulnerability.\n\nAmericans are usually nice to everyone, but their true generosity is frequently reserved for people they know or have a connection with. It's more transactional and we're more suspicious.\n\nOP used the word \"open\" - I'd use that for Canadians (and Australians, for that matter), but not so much for Americans.",
            "I am an American who wishes to appear genuine and friendly, because I am. So help me here: According to my notes, smiling is bad. Inquiring after someone\u2019s health or well-being or happiness is bad and fake. Showing energy or enthusiasm is bad. But showing reserve or caution is bad too? Have I got it right? Is there something I\u2019ve missed? \n\n/s\n\nFor the record, I have European friends and no one has ever told me they think I am being fake friendly to them. However, the European friends I have have lived for a time in the United States. Maybe they took a minute to understand the culture.",
            "Tbh I tend to find both American and Canadian niceness ingenuine because of all the damn small talk.",
            "I live in canada and let me tell you... there are a shit ton of douches and assholes here. Don't know how we got stereotyped for being so nice. It's probably no different then anywhere else in the world. There will always be good people and shitty people and canada is no different then anywhere else",
            "I suspect it\u2019s because Canadian niceness is \u201cSmaller\u201d.  It demands no response, it asks no questions, it requires no response but calm politeness and most important, at no time does the tone of voice change.  American niceness often involves the voice going up and the speaker sounds, to European ears, to be talking down to the hearers as though they are small children.",
            "Because people love stereotypes. Canadians can be just as assholes as Americans and Americans can be just a nice.",
            "American nicenes tends to be very in your face while canadian nicenes tends to be more shy and humble.\n\nMost European just identify more with the latter.",
            "As a brit, I have to say that my limited interactions with Americans & Canadians abroad leads me to believe that there may be regional variances, I could be wrong and that Americans are all monocultural /s, \n\nbut the few New Yorkers I've met are very similar to londoners, I've met 1 family from the deep south, they were extremely, like insanely nice and polite, may have been in a cult, I donno.\n\n I've only met 1 Canadian couple, they liked a drink and were nice, hard to tell though, we matched them drink for drink every day (holiday in the Dominican) and they were smashed after 8 or so.",
            "French here. For most / a lot  French people, Canada = Qu\u00e9bec, and everything else is basically the US but with a cute flag. I wouldn't be surprised if the rest of Europe doesn't really share that view because the connexion we feel with Qu\u00e9bec is based on our shared language but honestly, except thinking that indeed Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois are nicer than most French people, we don't really know Canadian enough to really think about them as something else than Americans with health care and ice-hockey so I think we'd expect them to behave the same way Americans would.\n\nConcerning how we feel about Americans being \"fake\" nice, I think we mostly think they're loud in their niceness, and way more easy-going than we are. The thing is, if a stranger were to engage with in the streets, he would be a) cat-calling me, b) trying to rob me, c) trying to sell me something or to get money for whatever charity so obviously when an American is starting to chat with me my first reflex would be to think they have a higher motive rather than being simply nice (this happened to me several time with American tourists in Paris and everytime my first thought was \"wtf? *watches around me, removes my hearbuds* are they talking to me? are they lost? do I know them?\").\n\nBut obviously I'm speaking for myself and what I feel like I've seen among my peers but I think some other French people might feel differently, and it is very probable that non-French Europeans have a totally different opinion of course, and at the end of the day the I feel like those clich\u00e9s and misconceptions mostly come from cultural differences, and there are as many genuinely nice Americans and Canadians (and Europeans) as there are fake and rude ones.",
            "West coast is nice but not kind, east coast is kind but not nice",
            "I know in the American South it is considered rude to not be over the top. Not standing and opening the door for a whole line of people, not complimenting food or the place of someone you visit, and not offering someone food or drink when they visit you are all seen as rude. Even people who are quite shy get dragged into small talk.\n\nIf someone were to physically stop me from saying \"Thank you! Have a nice day\" to the person manning the drive through I'd probably die.",
            "Tip from an American:\n\nWhen I ask \"How are you doing?\" its a rhetorical question.\n\nI don't GAF!",

Canadians regularly treat me incredibly poorly once they find out I\u2019m from the U.S. \n\nOn the flip side, my girlfriend who had never been to the U.S. was surprised to see how friendly everyone was. Interesting dynamic \n\nNote: My experience is purely anecdotal, don\u2019t overthink it.",
            "When I lived overseas I was told I was recognizably American by how confidently I walked. It was a weird compliment that I still don't know how to react to. Other than to take it as a compliment.",

            "Let\u2019s face it - Canadians care about each other.... health care is a human right... Americans don\u2019t. Thank you.",
            "Probably because the US can't seem to vote yes on universal healthcare. If Americans don't give a shit about whether their fellow man bleeds out in the street, or get extorted by the medical system for hundreds of thousands of dollars...Their smiles don't really translate into anything that can be construed as friendliness. So it's just a creepy manipulation by psychopaths who let people die of cancer while their family watches helpessly in anguish rather than get taxed slightly higher.\n\nIf a person snaps their fingers in a restaurant to get a waiter's attention and yells \"I SAID DIET COKE, MOTHERFUCKER!\" into their face, and then turns around and smiles at you to start or continue a conversation, their smile isn't really indicative of any kind of kindness or assurance that they wouldn't treat you differently than the waiter if you were in a different position. It's just fucking creepy not friendly.",

            "The reason why this happens is that your body adapts to the higher levels of neurotransmitters. In the beginning, your body is not used to it, that's why you feel such a massive rush and \"good\" feeling when you do something like drugs, watch an action movie, or eat really sugary and fatty food. But as time goes on, and you continue to perform these activities, your brain begins to mold itself and adapt to the increased levels of neurotransmitters. Producers begin producing less, and receptors become less sensitive. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou cannot produce a drug or an effect that increases neurotransmitter levels without your body adapting accordingly. That is an evolutionary trait remnant in our system from the dawn of multi-cellular organisms. It is a system designed to allow you to ignore the \"constant\" stimulation around you and find the most worthwhile thing. Be it the perfect berry bush in a forest, the fattiest animal, or the hardest and most pleasurable drug. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo downsides would mean we would have to rewire our brain in order to eliminate this effect. However, that would completely destroy our way of life. You would always be surprised and amazed by everything that you ever experience. Nothing would get done because we would be absolutely high off of our tits on neurotransmitters looking at the sunrise and stars.",
            "Having pure dopamine shots would be addictive, and would most likely make you feel worse when not using it. That's one of the things about dopamine: if you get a lot of it, your standards rise, so when you go back to getting normal levels of it, it feels like you're getting too little and you feel bad.",
            "There is, you can just directly stimulate the brain's pleasure centers.\n\n[Turns out](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/compass-pleasure_b_890342) if you can directly access your brain's reward mechanism you'll lose interest in everything else.",
            "Dopamine is addictive.",
            "For one, dopamine doesn\u2019t cross the blood brain barrier very well. For curiosity\u2019s sake, look up L-DOPA as a therapy for Parkinson\u2019s. It\u2019s the precursor for dopamine, and it crosses the bbb a bit better and supplements the dopamine deficiency in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease (which is caused by the death of dopamine neurons in a part of the brain called the substantia nigra).\n\nI mention all of this because it highlights a great point that answers your question - even dopamine doesn\u2019t do just one thing. Depending on which dopamine circuit you\u2019re talking about, it does many things, including regulating motor control/movement via the nigrostriatal dopamine circuit. You\u2019re likely thinking of the mesolimbic dopamine circuit, which involves totally different brain structures and is involved in reward and motivated behavior.\n\nOverall take home point being that when you take in a substance like a drug, you\u2019re effectively \u201cdumping\u201d a bioactive molecule into the entire system. Any receptor/channel/enzyme etc that has an affinity for your drug will bind. That\u2019s one major reason why we have side effects to drugs. Unintentional off-target consequences are a byproduct of this",
            "Any kind of drug that affects you is going to have an impact on your body, and your body will adapt a tolerance to it that requires more of the substance to use. We have a variety of mostly benign drugs that really aren't all that bad in small, infrequent amounts but the way our body adapts to the influence is what causes a problem.",

It can't be completely separated from that.  \n\n\nIn additions, messing with the body and brain's balance ALWAYS has other consequences.",
            "\"Feeling great\" is not harmless. Its dangerous to feel good. Joy leads to a lack thereof after the fact, making the pursuit of joy a never-ending wheel of suffering. It is always fleeting, and its absence leaves you with pain that never would have been there if not for the desire for it not to be. The act of wanting joy creates a hole, and like water, the joy that is poured into the hole dries up, leaving an emptiness. With no desire, no hole to fill, there will be no emptiness.",
            "Life is about balance. Primarily why there are the draw backs is it\u2019s the body resetting to its natural rhythm. Balancing that is difficult because you have to shift the body\u2019s rhythm to get rid of negative effects",

            "Whenever you are altering a biological system there will be some kind of affect.  There is a concept of equilibrium with bio systems.  Small changes are fine b/c the body can adjust back, but over time changes can be build up where the equilibrium is out wack leading to breakdown of the system here and there\n\nConstant supply of outside dopamine leads to the body:  \n\n1) Gain a tolerance to dopa\n2) Body stop producing its own as it has no need of dopamine producing organ\n3) excess dopamine affect other cells differently than neuro cell so side effects will happen",

This balance can lead to certain types of drugs, like ones that work with serotonin, more dangerous than others, like ones that work with dopamine.\n\nOne way a professor put it to me was think of each molecule as a team. The dopamine team has 20,000 members, while the serotonin team has 200. If you take or add some members from the dopamine team, it\u2019s not going to hurt the brain that much because there\u2019s already a lot and the brain can accommodate. However, if you take just one member, or add one, to the serotonin team, it\u2019s going to have a much larger impact.\n\nSo, the brain is not used to having a lot of serotonin. That\u2019s why, when there\u2019s too much serotonin, people basically turn into zombies like those people on bath salts (look up serotonin shock). If you get too much dopamine, you\u2019ll hallucinate too, but it\u2019ll eventually wear off without you needing to be hospitalized in most cases. If you go into serotonin shock, someone must restrain you and get you to the hospital.\n\nAs for why we can\u2019t just put the neurotransmitter in a pill, and would it be safer, the answer is a double no. Neurotransmitters cannot cross the blood-brain barrier because they\u2019re too big (stop buying GABA supplements, they do jack shit). It needs the building blocks (mainly tyrosine and tryptophan) to cross the barrier, then get converted in the brain. That\u2019s why Parkinson\u2019s patients take L-DOPA. L-DOPA is basically what you\u2019re talking about, because it crosses the barrier and gets immediately converted into dopamine, but that can be dangerous if you don\u2019t have Parkinson\u2019s.\n\nWhich leads to my next point, if you could just take dopamine or serotonin, it\u2019d honestly probably be more dangerous than our current drugs. Neurotransmitters bind with oxygen very readily (oxidation), so if it doesn\u2019t bind to a receptor within a few seconds of it being released, it\u2019s going to grab an oxygen somewhere. This oxygen is typically taken from neurons, thereby damaging them. This phenomenon is known as oxidative stress. If you could just load your brain with dopamine, most of it will just oxidize.\n\nThis is in contrast with amphetamine. Amphetamine increases dopamine by being taken up into the synapse and signals the receptor to release more dopamine, while simultaneously blocking the receptor that tells the neuron there\u2019s too much dopamine and it should lower the output (known as an autoreceptor). So, on amphetamine, you\u2019re neurons just keep pumping out dopamine and they can\u2019t really tell when it\u2019s crossed the typical limit for output.\n\nKey difference here is with amphetamine, there\u2019s a rate limiting factor in your body\u2019s reserves of tyrosine, L-DOPA, and dopamine. At some point, if you\u2019re body doesn\u2019t have enough dopamine or resources to make it, amphetamine will have no effect, and this prevents the brain from \u201cfrying\u201d itself with all dopamine being oxidized. Now, let\u2019s say take L-DOPA instead. Then you\u2019re just flooding your brain with an unlimited supply of dopamine materials that it\u2019s readily converting with nowhere for it to go. There\u2019s no control mechanism or rate limiting factor here, and a lot of it sure as fuck is not going to bind to a receptor. That will cause far more damage.\n\nTL;DR: Ironically, the current drugs we have are by far safer than if you could just take a dopamine or serotonin pill. It\u2019s impossible to completely remove harm from drugs, because all of them alter your homeostasis to create that high.",
