A book has papers'\nI can understand why  people would find that offensive but even I think its funny.\n\nI don't think anyone should be allowed to tell a person what they can and can't say, if you don't like what a person is saying , don't hangout with them.

            "I was 18 when I moved abroad for the first time. It was eye-opening. Understanding that other countries have a completely different perspective, in which your own country might not even appear except as a footnote, is liberating.",
            "I had a very similar experience my first time out of the States. \n\nIt\u2019s really a matter of perspective and who is telling the story and if they have a agenda with telling it. \n\nMedia is brainwashing. Advertising is brainwashing. Politicians brainwash with speeches. \n\nEverything you consume is \u201cbrainwashing.\u201d \n\nThink critically. Do your own research. Get info from credible peer reviewed places. \n\nEver look at what Times magazine looks like from other countries vs America?\n\nEdit: this goes a whole \u2018nother level when we start thinking about current day algorithms + how many people actually own the media giants in the US. \n\nThe best thing anyone can do it to find credible sources + travel. Talk to people from other places.",
            "I'll give you the opposite perspective: I'm European and have been traveling the world for about a decade, finally landing in the US five years ago. These are my experiences:\n\n1) every country learns primarily about their history, especially when that history is relatively brief. This is true for Italy, Honduras, Guatemala or the US. Wars or empires are the way you look into other countries, but even then, it's limited. And every country paints their history in a very hopeful and \"we weren't the bad guys and if we were it wasn't that bad\" kinda way. I've heard a lot of Americans complaining about not learning about slavery and Indian genocide to the fullest extent, but growing up in Italy, a lot of stuff about fascism and the post-war era terrorism phase was kinda glazed over. Not avoided per se, but not discussed at length. \n\n2) Every new country you go to will feel like the best. Heck, I thought central America was the best in the world, and that was after I almost got shot twice and actually got robbed multiple times. You're not seeing an objective representation of the place, you're looking at a tourist's view, you're bonding with locals who are educated enough to speak the language, you're finally independent and carefree, and everything is new. Think about this: when someone comes to the US for the first time, they go to LA or Vegas or NYC or DC and think it's the whole country. They don't meet with rural Oklahomans or go to Appalachian small towns or the deep red areas of Texas. You agree that they'd have a very different experience if they did, and so would you if you after a few years in a new country. A trasformative idea for me was this: no country or culture are better than another in an absolute sense, they're just different. \n3) All countries have propaganda, but the US has it just a little more. In my opinion, it developed because of two factors: economic superiority in the US in the early 1900s and a developing identity in a country that was very heterogeneous and very very recent. Americans needed to be \"aggressively\" Americans because most \"Americans\" were still strongly bound to their country of origin, and forming a national culture and identity would've been hard that way. Whether the experiment worked or not is hard to say, as americans now are still very focused on race, ethnicity and roots, and I'm not sure whether a strong sense of \"Americanness\" is developing or eroding. \n\nIn any case, if you're anything like me (and most people I met along my journey) you'll hate your country of origin and run away, then start to appreciate again after a few years. If you're restless now, this process is almost surely necessary, and I urge you to pursue it. Just remember that sooner or later you'll either want to come back, or redevelop some degree of appreciation for your country, so don't do anything permanent (like renouncing your citizenship), and don't discourage people from coming to the US by badmouthing the country: you're journey is away from here, but that won't be the same for everyone.",
            "Most countries have the same thing going on: it's not just America. I've lived in about ten different countries and very, very few of those countries' history classes teach anything about how \"we were the bad guys.\"\n\nI live in Turkey now and my students don't really study anything about history after roughly 1950. Asking intelligent people, I usually get the response that the government doesn't want people to know how their party made mistakes in the past.",
            "I'm actually surprised that you grew up in Cali and thought that the US was the best country in the world based off of what you learned in school.  I'm in rural Oklahoma and went to a shitty little school, and even we're taught about the fucked up shit that america got into during it's history.  Hell, when I took US history since 1877 in college they did *not* try to hide that shit.  I swear, half of that textbook was just about all of the bullshit that was happening throughout our history, and there were maybe a handful of parts that made America seem like this great country.",

Amazing food, bia hoi\u2019s are awesome, some cool ancient temples n stuff (lots of ancient sites were ruined during the war but there\u2019s a lot still), generally great scenery. \n\nHard to ride pillion on a 125cc moped if you\u2019re a fat cunt like I am though.",
            "Well, sure a lot of people have been indoctrinated.   \n\nWe start off saying the pledge everyday in school, have to stand at ballgames, and get all kinds of messages about patriotism in our movies and legends.  \n\nI guess I was lucky.  My grandfather and Mom, as well as the Christian Brothers that taught at my high school all encouraged me to question authority, and gave me the tools to do that.  \n\nAs you indicated, we might be told that the US is best, but we don't get to compare that to any kind of judgement matrix.    There are ~193 nations in the world.   Very few people have even visited them all, nvm actually living and working there for long enough to make an intelligent judgement.   \n\nI'm glad you are starting to look deeper.  \nI love being here in the US.  I've visited a few other places, and they have some nice points, too.   \n\nI know that history was never as neat as \"Columbus sailed the ocean blue in 1492\", or \"Listen my children and you shall hear of the midnight ride of Paul Revere\" \n\nA lot of our stuff is made up, or tweaked to fit a better poem, movie, story.   I lived through 9/11 at the WTC.  It wasn't much at all like the Nick Cage movie.   But that's fine - he is telling a story, not history.   Unfortunately, most people learn more from entertainment than they do from good sources. \n\nIf you have a couple of hours to kill, there is a great old western movie called \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence\".   A primary theme in that movie is that people rarely care about the facts/history.  They want to know about the legends.   They want the stories that make them feel good.",

            "I'm American but that hasn't been my experience.  I suppose a big part of it was that I live in a relatively liberal area, with liberal, agnostic parents, but I didn't grow up believing that America was better than everywhere else.  As a kid, I was curious about what life was like in other countries, although I didn't really understand the disparity between developed and developing countries until about sixth grade.  Because I spent so much time online looking at pictures of foreign cities -- many of which didn't look that different from US cities -- I concluded that most countries were about the same when it came to ordinary people's lives.  \n\nMy school said the Pledge of Allegiance every morning, but I didn't really think much of it.  To me, it was just as school thing.  Though, again, I might have believed differently if my parents and teachers enforced it more strongly, but they didn't, so I never took it as a blood oath.  It wasn't any different than singing something in music class.  It was just a performance the school asked for.\n\nI thought I'd see more of the world as an adult, but I've only been outside the US once.  I went to Ireland with my family.  I don't travel more largely because I don't like planes and usually when I do travel, I go to places where my family is.  My adult self is very boring compared to what I imagined I would be.",
            "I grew up in both the US and Hungary (born in 2003). This gave me a unique perspective of the world since I saw two very different places with their own culture. What I noticed was that in America the history taught is very narrow, and drills American exceptionalism into students. I didn't have anything like this in Hungary. Unfortunately, many people in the US don't care to learn.\n\nBy that, I mean they are convinced that America is the best, the only country with true freedom, etc. When you point out that this is not the case, they say you're stupid, hate America, and ungrateful.

Things like changing from \"E Pluribus Unum\" to \"In God We Trust\" as well as adding \"under God\" to the pledge which mostly became mandatory in schools; all to counter USSR. In many cases, especially up until the last 50 years or so, USA was \"the best\" in many things. Textiles, furniture, appliances, weaponry, technology, and many others. Due to profit margins and globalization spurred by technology, many of these things have decreased in quality. However, the culture has not shifted enough to realize that we are no longer #1. Cultures and attitudes are hard to change, especially when educating is mainly done by older generations who still believe we are #1. For example, I bought a new truck and am selling my old one. It is a Nissan and this older guy says he would be interested if it were an American truck not even caring that the Nissan was built in Tennessee and the American truck built in Mexico. So, yes, you got a bit of propaganda growing up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n I visited the Grand Canyon one time and a British couple said, \"My goodness, look at all the American flags.

One of the things that stood out to me was protesting. On one occasion, the whole shopping district was paralyzed. I asked someone what was going on and they said, \"They let the elementary schools out to protest.\" Say what? Try that in the USA.

You are just now experiencing this for the first time. But many people, the poor, minorities, hell, even middle class suburban cis genders white kids that were encouraged to think critically from an early age have always been aware of the US defeciencies.\n\nWith that said, sometimes this emphany leads people to the opposite conclusion, if the US isn't always wonderful, it must be always horrible. This is an equally reductionist and simplistic view. There are some things that the US does better than any other country, there are some things that the US does worse than every other country, but in most categories, the US is a  bit below the middle of the pack when compared to other highly developed democracies, and highly developed democracies are a head of most countries in many categories when compared to countries that are either not highly developed or democracies.",

Not enough local tragedies? Here's a house fire in Georgia (this one is real, I'm not making it up), a person who killed their family in another state. Almost never anything positive. My mom's response: well they cover some of that in the 5 o'clock news? Is it not news at 10? Is a festival in town somehow less relevant than a house fire in Georgia? You might be saying, that's just what the news is like, but it doesn't have to be. I lived in Iowa for a few years after college. You know what their news covers? Local festivals, plays at the community theater, upcoming movies at the park, etc. They still covered local fires and major events but they covered the positive stuff too. I got so used to this that I thought I must have imagined how bad the Texas news was. Then I visited family in Texas. No, not imagined. My theory is that the Conservative mindset likes to keep people feeling uneasy and a little scared so that they'll see a need for guns and well funded police and military. Moving to Iowa, I thought it would be pretty to similar to Texas but it was so much nicer there. The Texas Republican party has \"eliminate critical thinking from schools\" in their party platform. Compare that to the city I lived in Iowa that has a book festival. The city literally spends a weekend celebrating reading. There were also three public broadcasting channels one of which would play a number of British and Canadian shows. There were bike lanes on the road and more sidewalks for pedestrians. Grocery stores were smaller and more frequent so you could actually walk to them. There were at least two fully vegan restaurants, several Indian food restaurants one of which was vegetarian, and various other international cuisine from Gyros to Thai food that I had never had available in Texas (some of that has started to come to Texas as the state has grown these last few years). Between all this and actually being given the chance to learn about the world outside of Texas, I became a Liberal Democrat living in Iowa where I had previously voted Republican in Texas.",

            "Your comment is fair. However, hard to argue against the fact that that the United States is on average the single most important country in the world over the past 250 years. \n\nThat comes with a certain amount of baggage, including a self-centred worldview, distorted view of history and the US\u2019 place in history, the quality of life Americans enjoy, etc.\n\nThe history of the twentieth and in particular the early twenty-first centuries are largely about the United States, in the same way that the history of the world in the second century was largely about Rome. It is (was?) a hyper-power without equal. In those circumstances, the distortions you identify about the centrality of the US in recent world events are real, but perhaps not as significant as you think.\n\nWhere things are really distorted for Americans is their perspective that they enjoy the best quality of life in the world and all those who do not live in the US wish they were American - especially those in rural areas, and those who are lower on the social and economic ladder. \n\nTheir belief that everyone wants to be American, is desperate to live in the US, and that they enjoy such a high quality of life rings true with regard to certain areas in the world, primarily the developing world (and even then there are many, many exceptions), but not true of most areas of the developed world. \n\nThat leads to obsession with border security, immigration, \u201cglobalists\u201d, replacement theory, etc. on the part of many Americans.\n\nI\u2019ve been traveling for the past seven months (I\u2019m a Canadian) and no question the US is omni-present in most countries in the world in a way that other large and powerful nations (India, China, Germany) are simply not.",
            "1. \"America is the best\" - It is more or less true - FOR THE COUNTRY - USA has largest economy, huge resources, very large population, the strongest military, huge cultural influence, good allies - So, when you compare which country is the best - USA would obviously come to mind.\n\n2. But for the general people living in the USA, it is not best - Not even top 10. Infrastructure is getting old, homelessness, corporate greed, gun violence, stupendous healthcare, polarized politics. \n\nE.g. If you are uber rich - You are better off somewhere in an island country with less taxes or Dubai.\nIf you are poor - USA would be the last developed country you would want to live in. \nIf you are working ambitious 'upper middle class' - Yes, USA was among the best 2-3 decades back, and still good. But there are more growth opportunities in many other fast emerging economies. \n\n3. Only those people who have the back of mighty USA enjoy its real greatness. E.g. Top politicians of USA, CEOs of the big corps, powerful billionaires, Military generals, CIA etc. In a gist - If you call someone to do something, and he/she is not cooperative, then if you cannot summon the power of USA, USA is not the best country for you.\n\n4. Culturally and historically, USA is very new compared to Europe, India and China etc. So, in that regard USA will always be behind. I think most students usually study 80% history of their own country,  and just some topics on World Wars, French Revolution, Ancient Egypt/China/India/Persia.

We corresponded for a little while after he returned, and I got the sense that once back home, the all conquering patrioitically-correct atmosphere slowly pulled him back into American exceptionalism? \n\nBut at least *whilst* travelling, his mind was apparently broadened.",
            "Canadian here. I always thought we had a valuable perspective because even though we're inundated with American culture, we can still retain a healthy distance from it if we so choose. I'm 54, and all my life, the sentiment towards the US here has tended to be \"friendly, but suspicious and worried\". The US seems to us like a friend who's a great person when sober, but who becomes a monster when drunk. Most of us don't understand the American way of thinking. We interpret the phrase \"American exceptionalism\" differently than Americans do ... They take it to mean \"the US is the most *exceptional* [i.e. \"best\"] country;\" but we tend to interpret it negatively, as in, \"The US is so full of itself that it thinks it can be the *exception* to every international rule that most of the rest of us need to obey,\" like the International Criminal Court, for example.\n\nWhat I consider the clarity of seeing you from the outside has led to huge differences of political opinion over the years, and history shows that we've usually been right. In the 80s, most of us thought that Ronald Reagan was *clearly* going senile in his second term, and not too bright to begin with. In 2003, we thought that *of course* the US was invading Iraq on false pretenses, and our government refused to participate. In 2016, we thought that *of course* Hillary Clinton was a bland, competent, intelligent politician who was so disparaged by the Right precisely because she *would* do a good job as president and thereby make the Republicans look bad. Also in 2016, we knew that Donald Trump was a stupid, amoral criminal (as most attentive people knew since the 80s). And so polls showed that if Canadians had a vote in the US election, we would've voted 80%-20% for Hillary. \n\nThis isn't to say that our people never get suckered by propaganda, or never make bad collective decisions. It's just that everything seems so much more absurd and *extreme* south of the border that it feels like a *very* foreign place sometimes, even though Canadians and Americans are superficially similar in so many ways.",

In senior secondary we could choose to do more Canadian history (few people did), or another, somewhat more thoughtful world history course.  There was also a Geography course somewhere in there, junior sec, I think, half of which was memorising the names of Canada's rivers, the other half of which was about the rest of the world and it's features, including a bit about the cultures and people.\n\nYou know what we didn't get?  US history.  The only times the US was mentioned were when they kept trying to invade us, and losing, and when we learned about the runaway slaves who came to Canada.  Of course, since half of our television and most of our movies were from the US, we didn't need a lot of additional 'teaching', although we were quite surprised how  the US thought it had saved the world in two world wars when we'd been taught it was a latecomer to both...",

We're not the most educated, we're not the happiest, we don't have the best health care, we don't have the best life expectancy.\n\nWe are a very DOMIANANT nation. We have the best military and our cultural products like our movies are the most dominant on the international market. We are also a leader in some types of scientific innovation. But what has it translated into for American quality of life, relative to our various western counterparts? Jack shit.",
            "Somehow I evaded being too involved in the brainwashing. At first I thought people were just over the top with how much they enjoyed living in America. By the time I was in high school I had been fed up. I was sick of hearing excuse after excuse for our countries blatant war crimes, racism and disdain for the poor. Seeing recruiters tricking my friends into \"being true patriots\" (where have we heard that before?) And sending them off to be murdered or traumatized.. one of my friends didnt even speak the same way when they returned as they had conditioned him into dropping his dialect to conform. Others passed away or slipped into addiction. \n\nA dentist I worked for would constantly shit on other countries and saying ours are so much better and we should be lucky to be here. He always compared us to the poorest countries controlled by corrupt governments. When I asked \"shouldnt we be comparing ourselves to other first world countries?\" He scoffed. Not much to say when you're comparing standard of living to places with universal healthcare, paid/extended maternity AND paternity leave. Not to mention the fact that they actually had financial support from their govs through the pandemic. Meanwhile we ge6 1800 and are called entitled. I'm over it.",
            "While this is very true, in many respects you are getting the same thing while visiting other countries. It's like visiting another US city or state. You generally see the good and cool things and don't experience, or at least truly experience, the bad things they have to offer so they look really great. They are also not going to let their skeletons out of the closet so you will think it's great and you will come visit there again and bring in money. Everywhere does it. Like I said your views are not unfounded, but everywhere has good and bad. There are things that would be wonderful to have that we don't have and things that we have that others only wish they could have. Where you are you're always going to see all the ugly parts because you're locked in you're married to that place already. The other place is the single person that wants you to visit and spend your money there without costing them the large base cost that being a citizen costs them. They just want to keep you interested, so showing the bad parts is not a good thing to do.",

Never understood why troops bombing the middle east protected my freedoms and grew up to understand that it's because it doesn't. I didn't come here in an antagonistic way either. It was my mom's dream to live in the US, and I was young so I was just going with what my mom thought was best. It's impossible to know for certain, but I'm pretty sure we would've been just fine if we had stayed in our country. She lost her home in 2008 and I don't know if I want to pay the inflated prices of homes even if they're attainable for me. It's a country of many people who criticize terms they don't understand and regularly publishes ridiculous claims like North Koreans claiming to have discovered unicorns. It's a country of hyperboles with no room for nuance. I only feel at home with immigrants (from any nation really) when I'm in the US.",

            "The problem with balancing out the other side is that you still started on one side so it still doesn't feel equal. I do this a lot less now but as a child I would get frustrated with it. If for example I winked my left eye, I would then wink my right. Then I would start again by winking my right eye first and then my left. Then I would repeat the whole process by winking right left left right. Then left right right left right left left right. It would get into a cycle and I could only stop if something external distracted me from it.",
            "A few other commenters on here are correct that \u201cbalancing\u201d is a common symptom of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. However, before you freak out, remember that mental health is a spectrum. You can have OCD-like tendencies without being diagnosed with OCD. Generally, something is considered a mental illness when it is distressing, long-lasting and not correlated with any other causes or drugs/medications, you can\u2019t stop it, and it is disruptive to your life in multiple spheres (e.g. family, friends, health, job, school, love life, etc.). With OCD compulsions/obsessions, the DSM-V states that for diagnosis, people must lose at least [an hour of time](https://beyondocd.org/information-for-individuals/clinical-definition-of-ocd) to these per day. \nSo, essentially, you may be a bit closer to OCD on the spectrum of things, but not necessarily \u201cover the line\u201d into clinical mental illness. \n\n*Why is it helpful to know where this line is?*\n1. Usually, when you\u2019ve crossed the line into falling into the diagnostic criteria for a mental illness, it means that you are really going through a tough time and you may continue to struggle without some kind of outside intervention or help. \n2. If you *haven\u2019t* crossed the line into clinical OCD, I think it\u2019s nice to know that all behaviour and thought patterns are on a spectrum. You may be different from some people, but there are lots of people out there who experience the same things as you. It\u2019s a big world out there and you are a unique combination of millions of different possibilities. \n\nAlso, if you *don\u2019t* have Obsessive Compulsive Disorder but you have a compulsive tendency like this, you can keep doing it if it doesn\u2019t bother you and isn\u2019t affecting your life and relationships. However, if it bothers you or is affecting your life, even if you *don\u2019t* have OCD, you can still reach out for help, support, or strategies. \n\nIf you *do* find this distressing and think that you might have OCD, talk to your family doctor about getting a referral for a psychiatrist and they can give you better help and more accurate information than self-diagnosis over the internet. \n\nTl;dr - a broad spectrum of behaviour differences from person to person is normal. Once a behaviour becomes distressing or disruptive to your life, that\u2019s when you would benefit from outside help.\n\nEdited to add more detail and last paragraph before tl;dr.",

For example, OP needs to balance out a sensation on their hands (compulsion), or the imbalance will trigger thoughts/impulses of tearing their fingernails out (obsession). While there\u2019s apparently such a thing as \u201cpure O\u201d OCD\u2014OCD without compulsions\u2014I\u2019ve never heard of the inverse.    \nI really like u/healeys23\u2019s entire comment on this. Despite the connections that can be made, OP, don\u2019t worry about having OCD unless there\u2019s an anxiety associated with your behaviour.

            "My understanding based upon personal experience is that this behavior begins as a way to gain a feeling of control, even if just symbolic control over a small inconsequential area of your life. For me it began when I moved from elementary school to middle school. At the same time the physical and emotional abuse I received at home from my parents intensified and the began encouraging my brothers to abuse me too. For some reason a group of about 6 or 7 kids at school began to beat the crap out of me before and after school, in the locker room before and after gym, in the hallways between class changes and even in homeroom and social studies class. Many teachers knew but did nothing to help. \n\nTo OP and others posting here that are not or have not spoken to an experienced psychologist or psychiatrist about this please do so as soon as you can manage. This can get worse. Not that it will but it can get worse, so much worse you cannot even imagine. You could find yourself progressing to other debilitating coping methods that are much harder to manage, harder to hide and potentially much more difficult to treat, even ways that are so resistant to treatment that even with psychological and/or psychiatric help treatment is rarely successful. I got away from my family, moved far away and even changed my name. Then spinal damage my father inflicted upon me when I was 12 that was left untreated caused me to be paralyzed from the neck down in my mid thirties. My family was able to get me back under thier control and I have spent the last 15 years trapped in a small room while they continue to physically and emotionally abuse me.\n\nEdit: I was close to escaping and had a housing specialist helping me find an apartment but then COVID hit and I\u2019m back to square one. Stuck in a a hospital bed in 300 square foot room. Blind. Diaper changed twice a day. Shower once a week, twice if I\u2019m lucky.

Like if I moved my arm for some reason, not necessarily to grab something but say I was trying to  shrug a bug off my shoulder. I\u2019d have to move my other arm the exact same way. And if I didn\u2019t do it \u201cright\u201d I\u2019d have to start over. Like, if I didn\u2019t move my arm similar enough to how I\u2019d moved my first arm, I\u2019d have to try again. I\u2019d \u201cstart over\u201d by moving my right arm, then my left (or whatever order) and going back and forth until I got the movements similar enough so it felt \u201cequal\u201d.

            "Oh wow I can actually answer what happens here. I'll do my best to explain what's happening because I learned it a really long time ago.\n\nBasically the nerves in your eyes can only do one thing: signal \"sight\" to your brain. Normally they are activated by light hitting them, but in the case of you rubbing your eyes for a long time or very hard, you can also activate them. The pressure and lack of light likely sends a bunch of random signals to your brain, which does its best to interpret it. Randomness isn't really our brains' strong suit, so it ends up being an unintelligible mass of lights and patterns.  \n\nAs for why it feels good, I couldn't tell you. Maybe it's from technically massaging the eyes muscles that control your pupils but that one is a bit of a stretch. Also could be because it helps reduce intra-ocular (in the eye) pressure.",

It's hella annoying. I haven't tripped in about 16 years, and it's been 20+ since I was heavily involved. So many sheets, so many vials... \n\nI don't *regret* necessarily, but It does get obnoxious.

In Japan, the historical use of washiki (Japanese traditional squat toilets) has meant pooping on a dry, flat surface. Like dispensing a soft serve icecream, this tends to created swirl-shaped poop. So in Japan, even if western-style toilets are more popular nowadays, this soft-serve shape is a cultural shorthand for \u201cpoo\u201d, even if it is not brown-colored (like this character from Dragon Ball: https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Poop-Boy ) it is still understood to be poop just because of the shape.",

A lot of public toilets in China, Korea, and Japan are flat surfaces with a hole that you squat on.  So people there have more experience seeing their poo in that shape.

            "Here's why:\n\nWe depend a lot more on people NOT doing harm than we depend on people committing good. It's a lot more important to me that you not harm me than it is that you do favors for me.\n\nLet's say I give you an option between two roommates.\n\nThe first is kind of an ass, but will generally be respectful of your boundaries and won't betray you. They just won't go out of their way to help you out.\n\nThe second one will, 95% of the time, do your chores, help you out, lend you money, etc. But 5% of the time they will betray you and be willing to harm you.\n\nI think you'd end up a lot safer with the first roommate than the second.\n\nFinally: most humans believe, not unreasonably, that a single act of evil is a good sign that the person will be willing to do it again. Most people don't sincerely use \"evil\" to mean accidents or even negligence (unless they're speaking abstractly or in hyperbole). They use it to mean intentionally violating someone's rights. Most of our experiences suggest that when someone proves themselves willing to violate social norms enough to outright be evil (which is actually hard for the average person to do, psychologically), they are likely to do so again. So we isolate them to protect ourselves.\n\n\"Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me,\" as they say, unless \u201cthey\u201d is George W Bush.\n\nUpdate: thanks for all the awards, nice people.

I save numerous lives and properties from being ruined or destroyed.\n\nMy collection of deeds should not give me a free pass to kill whomever I want at all because of all the good I did. Ideally, it should balance out, but in practice, it could lead to some scenarios where people bank on whatever they've done previously to save themselves if they commit something heinous.",

The answer to your question is the same as the answer to \"why is it if I breathe all the time, nothing happens, but if I just don't breathe for even like a half hour suddenly I'm dead?\" Because the default is breathing.\n\nYou have in your head that \"neutral\" is half way between good and evil. But it's not. It's at 99.99999% good and 0.00001% evil. You're *supposed* to be good.\n\nTo elaborate in a more satisfactory answer, being good usually doesn't cost you very much, and being evil, wile being evil usually costs others a whole lot while being only moderately beneficial to you. So we all have this intuitive sense about justice and understand for the species at large, this is counterproductive behavior.

            "If you think about toddlers and young elementary school age kids, they have an extremely strong sense of justice. It develops super early, and kids are quick to \u201cfinger wag\u201d at the wrong doer. Their sense of and need for justice comes from their own developing sense of right and wrong. And this coupled with being self-centered are traits that are both crucial for their own early survival. It\u2019s important for a kid to maintain this formation of a healthy strong self, which includes a somewhat unattractive righteousness. So an outlier peer who suddenly does a wrong punishable act is a threat to that individual and later as the child grows older to the whole environment and social system. It threatens what the child is coming to know as right and wrong, and equally warrants punishment to set it all straight - justice. \n\nThe rewards and positive reinforcements for good behaviors are also somewhat forthcoming in the way of learned \u201cthank you\u2019s\u201d as an example and shares, but way less noticeable, in part because there is no immediate high threat, meaning no urgency for justice.  So, praise for good deeds are there, but stand out less, and don\u2019t hold the gravity and sheer importance of immediate threat.\n\nAdults kind-of still operate the same way, but obviously with more added complications and unfortunate manipulations. And shame is also a social equalizer used by adults more readily in more complex ways for personal gains that still are motivated by a different type of survival.",

You can do something a million times just fine, but something bad happens once then suddenly you're on high alert around it. You could work on ladders every day for years, up and down, but it teeters over once, even if you're uninjured, you're hesitant to go up again even though nothing's changed, just because you now realize personally what could go wrong. \n\nSimilar thing with like, say your boss is having a meeting with a business partner and you bring in some coffee for them. You trip, and spill it all over the business partner's suit. It's a complete accident, entirely human, yet for some reason it's just reflexive of the business partner to assume that this human, that no doubt competently walks all the time, is tripping over themselves constantly, and if they're this clumsy then what kind of work do they do (because walking prowess equates to being able to typing up documents somehow), and do I want to be working with someone that has such standards for their employees? And even if the business partner *doesn't* actually think all that, the boss is likely to assume they think so anyway, leading to firing, demoting, shuffling you to some other location so the business partner thinks they have higher standards.

            "In islam at least, a single good deed is enough for salvation.\n\n\nYou don't even have to do a good deed, so long as you have a genuine heartfelt intention to change your life and become a good person for the rest of your life. For example, if you made such an intention but you suddenly died before you can act upon it (a very unlikely set of circumstances tbh). \n\nThere are some caveats. You cant make that intention on your deathbed. And you cant \"plan\" your intention, meaning you cant plan to do a bunch of evil deeds and then plan to change your life around, and then die doing something noble.\n\nBasically, if you think of any way to try and exploit that ticket to salvation, you wont be granted it (you cant fool an omnipotent god). To reiterate, sincerity from the bottom of your soul is key. If you want to discuss this idea in depth, we'll have to go down a really deep rabbit hole of islamic theology.\n\nThe idea behind this concept is to not provide an easy way to heaven, but to serve as inspiration that it is (almost) never too late to repent and turn your life around. The life you have been given can (almost) never enter a hopeless state where you are too far gone.",

            "This is a very complex topic of philosophy (actually almost every philosophy topic is a pain in the ass) this topic always tied to religions and the concept of heaven and hell and stuff. Most of the time people used this system to draw people to act good and not bad (as they see it) so they created this rule but I don't think that its really holds up and legit, I mean religiously when I assume that there is heaven and hell and stuff",
            "Because anyone with a life of good deeds has gained respect and trust of others along the way. The condemnation comes from the abuse of people\u2019s trust and expectations. Being disappointed is a feeling people don\u2019t soon forget.",
            "One single act of everyone doesn't always condemn a life of good deeds. It depends on the acts.\n\nIn my country people get warnings or lighter sentences for first offenses and societal participation is valued before sentencing. \n\nIn the eye of the public it also depends on the level of both deeds. If you always visit your grandma and take her for a walk that creates an image of good deeds. If you steal a candy from her, that probably won't nullify the image. If you kill her.. it certainly will. \n\nOther way around same thing if you always bullied kids or act like a pervert at work.  And then decided to help out an old lady Cross the street. That's not going to even out the image. But if you put all your savings in a fund for less fortunate women, and stop being evil that might balance the scales.",
            "I think it's relevant to note that the law doesn't necessarily reward good deeds, even on their own. The law isn't concerned with whether you've done something you deem morally applaudable or reprehensible, so long as you aren't inhibiting another citizen's freedom or safety. So, if we're talking strictly law, I believe that's why a person is, quite literally sometimes, condemned for actions that have proven fatal to other civilians. The justice system is flawed, I'm not trying to even suggest it's not, but I think that's the concept behind the idea of the judicial system.\n\nIn broader society, I actually do think there many people who are quick to find compassion for a person's story. But understanding why someone did something and valuing them as a flawed human with potential to grow doesn't mean you have to overlook the actual crime. Compassion isn't blind.\n\nOur past actions provide context to our future ones. What we do reflects who we are. If you see someone with a neutral background, neither charitable nor particularly egotistical, who then commits murder, you might have different questions than for, say, a person with a background particularly inclined toward \"good\" deeds who has committed the same crime. \n\nBecause ultimately morals are a private conviction and someone following their own code will do so for their own sake and for their own reasons. If someone is known for doing good things and then does something uncharacteristically evil, the chances are that there were extenuating circumstances surrounding the event. Someone who believes murder is evil and wrong won't take such an action lightly, no matter how many people they have helped along the way. I know for me, personally, the bad things I have done (not murder lol) never feel counterbalanced with the good things I have done. They're completely separate categories. The good doesn't make the bad any better. That's why forgiveness is such a big deal, and why several families of victims refuse money to compensate for their loss. I believe it is also the reason an apology means more to me than a gift basket when I've been wronged.\n\nI could be completely generalizing/off because I haven't been everyone else in this world, but from what I've seen, nobody truly believes their good deeds merit a bad one here and there. Good is its own reward. Evil is the same. Maybe some people don't figure that out until they cross the line, though.\n\nJust some thoughts off the top of my head.",
            "Firstly, the major problem with this philosophical morality question is that it speaks in absolute terms of good and evil. \n\nIdk about other countries but America has a real stick up it's ass about the concept of good and evil. \n\nThere is no one act that is wholly good, no sin you can commit which is wholly evil. \n\nYou can shift the numbers around and make it so that your task is \"more evil\" or \"more good\" but these are arbitrary concepts and values, they don't mean anything. \n\n\nWhat defines good and evil is typically the ethics of the day the ethics of yesterday and the ethics of the tomorrow that could be, and how these concepts interact with an individual's personal morality, as the justification for having committed their acts for whatever purpose they commit them. \n\n\nPeople speak in terms of good and evil because of the black and white duality of their nature. The black and white is crisp and clear and easy to understand on a basic surface level. \n\n\nBut in reality, measuring things as \"good\" or \"evil\" is a complete waste of time. Jack Sparrow is mostly a bad man, but his shining moments of heroism make him shine all the brighter. You cannot say he is wholly evil, not can you describe him as an agent of evil. He is evil, only because you have disagreed with his actions. You disagree with his actions only because they are against the law and you follow the law because following the law is what \"good\" people do, and most people strive to be \"good\" because once you realize that \"evil\" is only really as \"evil\" as you let it be, it's hard to go back to just being \"good\". \n\n\nI hope this helps.",

            "Part of it is because forgiving or condemning is the prerogative of the Other on an individual basis.\n\nLet's say someone kills a person in cold blood - it's abject murder. They go to prison, serve their sentence, feel remorse, and earnestly turn their life around.\n\nIs anybody doing anything wrong if they give the murderer a chance? No. But neither is anybody doing anything wrong if they opt not to trust them. People can't be obligated to forgive.\n\nSecondly, and I think more importantly, it would be terrifying to create such a simplistic \"ledger\" of moral balance... Save 10 lives, get one free murder!\n\nIf we knew that there's a simple math underlying forgiveness, then there would no lasting consequence in committing atrocities aside from putting in the necessary time and effort to 'balance the ledger.'\n\nGood and bad deeds simply aren't directly linked like that. Good deeds aren't the currency of bad ones. We would never think that people have 'banked' enough good deeds that they're now 'owed' a bad one. So if good deeds can't 'buy' bad ones beforehand, there's no reason why they should allow you to 'pay off' bad deeds after the fact.\n\nEDITED: for the inevitable spelling/grammar errors I can never find before I post, and 'cuz I thought of something that clarified my point at bit better.",

We all will necessarily hurt others at one point or another. The fact you fucked up doesn't necessarily mean you're irredeemable. **But** in order to be redeemable, you must own your mistakes.

            "A thought experiment that came to mind when reading this: \nImagine you are stacking building blocks to form a tower: every block up is one good deed. You pull the first block out of all the existing towers you see so they all crumble but then you put one on top of an existing one. The opposite would be to build a tower 15 blocks tall doing 15 good deeds but then doing one bad thing in pulling out the first one so the whole thing falls. In both cases the bad does outweigh the good by far. \nIt is much easier to destroy something (by doing bad/pulling one out) than to do good (by tediously stacking block after block) \n\nMaybe this needs a bit more thinking but I believe it works quite well as a metaphor",

There are also plenty of people that would forgive you for a bad deed and continue treating you well. The saying isn't absolute.\n\nWe all just want to live happily and peacefully. Even if the person next to you chooses not to do a good deed, it isn't something that really affects you or hurts your life. You wouldn't blame them for it. But if they do the good deed, of course you'll be grateful for it.\n\nOn the other hand, if someone does a bad deed, it hurts you. We don't want people around us to be doing bad deeds so we try to discourage it. Good deeds are not so valuable that we would say \"if you do a good deed we'll let you get away with a bad one\". That type of rule will usually result in more bad than good. Instead, to discourage bad deeds we make them illegal, and if someone has a demonstrated high risk of doing them we put them in jail where they can't really hurt anyone.\n\nIt's not about judging whether people are good or evil, it's just about separating or punishing people who do bad deeds. If they later do good deeds after they're released from prison, I'm sure they'd be praised for that. But it's a separate matter.",

            "because the people who write these kind of moral rules are the evil people who hide it. \n\nin order to forestall people realizing who is truly evil, the evil will seek out and punish people who are more often than not - good. \n\nthis serves 2 purposes, victimization of people who normally are not evil by those who are, and a normalization of that victimization of people who are more often than not - good.\n\nwhat evil requires in order to thrive and function is the nullification of good, and since thats hard to do without 'outing' oneself as evil, these more subtle ways of punishing good people are utilized by the evil people.\n\ni believe the most stark example of this is the forced resignation of Al Franken from the US Senate. for Americans, it wasnt a question of if what Franken did was wrong but an opportunity for evil to masquerade as doing good. what they say about the road to hell being paved with good intentions is absolutely true. another is the sexual assault allegations against Neil DeGrasse Tyson. there is a whole evil subculture out there that wants to have hell on earth for some reason. when evil thinks its doing good is when the biggest atrocities occur.",

I'm no psychotic therapist or anything.",
            "well, let's define good as \"carrying a kitten across the road\", and evil as \"killing people in cold blood\" - then good is maybe just not good enough against evil.   \nMore to the point: acting \"good\" is the expected norm.",

            "The bad deed throws into question the integrity of the good deeds. Were they doing them expecting something? To earn points? To hide their true intentions?\n\nPlus most \"good deeds\" are just basic human decency. They are what should be considered the default. It's the \"above and beyond\" good deeds that stand out.\n\nAnd a lot of bad deeds are a sign that someones overall views and values are messed up. Look at Mother Theresa. Largely remembered for a lot of good, until you dig under the surface and see she was a monster. Caused a lot of suffering literally because her beliefs were that people needed to suffer.\n\nI look to see whether someone tries to learn from the bad they do to do better next time. That's the real sign of a good person. Most try to pretend it never happened, blame others, claim it was actually a good deed, etc.Thats truly what makes truly bad actions stand out.",

            "Because we get tired\u2026 and we start liking our beds more after an 60 hour workweek dealing with bosses and stuff. We also tend to have babies and spouses who don\u2019t get along with a friends spouse. \n\nMostly though, we are tired. We still like doing it, but damn, we like our sleep.",
            "I'm in my late 30s and still do this. But I live in a different city than most of my friends, so when they visit it's not practical for them to just go home at night.",
            "my group of friends has giant friends weekends at each others houses 3 or 4 times a year",
            "Not all do, it just gets harder to do as often. \n\nPeople have less free time due to work, taking care of their home, taking care of any pets, taking care of their kids and spending time with their significant other. While you probably already do work in the form of schoolwork and a part time job, perhaps have a pet and a SO, it's the taking care of the house that can take up a lot of time. There's always something to do and it's not the same as you doing some chores for your parents. Plus it's one thing to skip class or call in sick for a part time job because you stayed up all night versus having to call in sick for a job later on in life that may have more responsibilities and people who report to you.\n\nThen add on that your friends are probably spread much further out and you just don't have the same energy level in your 30s as you do in your teens or early 20s. Even if you are able to do the same activities, the recovery time is much longer. If I don't get a good nights sleep or have a hangover, takes me days to fully recover versus back in the day, I'd be fine after sleeping in a bit and drinking a lot of water.\n\nWith all that said, my friends and I still plan what I guess could be sleep overs and game nights. Since I have friends who live at least an hours drive away, I usually sleep over if we planned some activities. \n\nAgain, takes more planning as my calendar is probably already full with weekend activities like weddings, visiting my parents, visiting my SOs parents, hanging out with my SOs friends, hanging out with my SOs siblings, fitting in time to mow the lawn/clean the house/fix anything that needs fixing/groceries, and of course having 1-1 time with my SO. My past two weekends for example involved driving a 5 hours away for my MILs 70th birthday and one weekend with my SOs friends where they rented a lake house. In August, I currently only have one weekend that doesn't already have set plans and I probably need to use that weekend to take care of things around the house.\n\nMy friends have all those things happening plus some have kids so just gets harder to find time we are all free. We still manage to do so though because we want to. Just takes more effort and planning than when we all lived either together or within a few minutes walk of each other in college and could stroll into whoever's apartment we wanted at basically any time.",

As you age, your friends \u201cguest bed\u201d may become quite nice, and you may very well find yourself sleeping over again!",
            "My friends and I did this well into our mid 20s. But at some point you have other obligations, getting up to work, having kids, etc. so you can't have them quite as often (if at all).",

            "I'm 32, married and have a one year old. We definitely still have sleepovers. With other families. Where every adult goes to bed around 10/11pm as we're all getting up at 5/6am. \n\nBuuut, it means we don't have to get home for bedtime by 7pm so we actually get to enjoy the evening. We also have friends scattered around the country so a lot of the time it's the only way to see them.",

This is my experience as \u00e0 28 year old who goes out for drinks with girlfriends Fridays or Saturdays.\n\nId honestly rather smoke a fat joint in my Dino onesie and watch natgeo, but hey, social pressure.",

            "Because when we have grown adults sleeping over at another grown adult's home, it's either referred to as \"crashing\" or as being a guest. Also, it doesn't happen as often because I would assume most of these adults have partners they want to go home to. There's no novelty of going to another grown adult's home, as a group, to sleep over unless some or all of your guests live out of town, or there's bad weather, or they've been drinking.\n\nMost people just want to go home because spending the night at someone else's home, especially if this person has a partner of their own and wants privacy, feels like you're invading their *privacy*. Some might also have children so either you go home because you have children to care for, or the friend's home has children, most people just generally don't spend the night to \"sleep over\" in a friend's family home.\n\nThere's also the question of work. Some people have night or early morning shifts. Some people might require being called to work at a random hour (hospital, emergency services, etc). Some people might need to prep for work and rather do that in their own home. \n\nThere's a lot of reasons why adults, in general, don't do this.",
            "I like the answer \"because we're tired\". It might be inconceivable to a 18 year old, but at 48 I look forward to going to be at 10 and have zero interest in staying up until all hours of the night. Maybe stay up until midnight if I don't have to work the next morning, but never later. I also like the answer \"because we have kids\". I personally don't, but if you don't, most of the people who you'd want to sleep over with do. \n\nFinally, the point of the sleepover is to be able to socialize with other kids while still having a parent sort of around. As an adult I can just drive myself to a bar, or a park, or a friend's house for a BBQ to hang out with friends.",
            "My fiance and I still go over to our friends' house almost every weekend. We used to work with them (another couple) and became great friends.

            "you reach an age where sleeping in your own bed is just way more preferred. that combined with the ability to drive or afford a cab/ride home, it's just rare I'd decide to spend the night at a friend's place.",
            "There's no time for that unless the stars align. Schedules can't clash, chores must be done, family must be fed. No time to stay up late if your friend needs to go to work 6 am, or 7 pm and come home 4 am. I used to have morning shifts, then night shifts. When I come home I'd either do some chores or fall asleep immediately. Maybe get in the bath if I'm in agony. A friend of mine who's a truck driver works 80 hours a week.\n\nEven IF there was time, I'd probably just want to spend it with my family, because I don't get to see them much.",

            "My friend is always trying to get me to sleep over at his house and play his ps5 all night. I don't do it often because I like going to bed early, not messing up my sleep schedule, sleeping in my own bed, and just keeping to myroutine in general.",
            "When you're a kid you have this massive peer group that all has roughly the same schedule. They have the same weekends, same vacation days, and most people you know from school live within easy driving / bussing distance from the school.\n\nNow that I'm an adult, the people I call friends live all over the place. If I made a list of people I'd like to have lunch with, let alone a sleep over, there are probably more of them living outside of my city or state than physically close to me. I have several friends that I only see every couple years when one of us takes a vacation and travels near the other. Last year just before Covid hit hard I had a friend living in Australia visit me in California and had a blast spending a week with them. But we had to plan that over a month in advance.\n\nOf those that live close to me, we don't always have matching schedules. I had a coworker from a former job that grew to be one of my best friends - outside of my family she's one of the only people I actually just randomly talk on the phone with. But now she works different hours and days than me at a different job, so our free time rarely overlaps.\n\nThen there is the great chasm of single folks vs those with kids. I had a group of college friends that stayed in touch and made a lot of time for each other, but when the social butterfly of the group got married, then had two kids, she stopped arranging things and we all drifted apart a bit. I still see them sometimes, but the last time was over 2 years ago.",

Thus a sleepover would look like this: At 10p, I would want to checkout and meet sleep like you would a lover. Trust me, it's that important. The sharpest acuity, mental focus, reasoning, game playing ability, philosophical discourse and discussions would then happen about an hour or two after waking up. Therefore, this is the time where the men would get after it. I know this may sound strange but as you enter middle age, your body doesn't process stuff the way it used to.  Long gone are the days of a 6 or more beers and smoking joints etc etc. You trade that in for 1/2 a beer if even that bc you're buzzed AF. And cannabis? Don't get me started. 1 hit off of the super dank that cannabis geneticists are kicking out is WAY over the top and water you don't want to get into unless you're feeling up for an adventure. You discover that you gain much more satisfaction simply being mostly or completely sober and resonating and connecting with your friends. Life becomes much more simple and you discover you really don't need much to derive maximum satisfaction. The concept of having more and more doesn't mean better and better but rather the opposite aka the point of diminishing returns, where too much of anything is def not fun. This is because you want to remember and cherish these moments and shared experiences with the pals and wouldn't trade that in for the temporary pleasures of external stuff to get you there",

            "Eh, it still happens into your 30s, depending on your lifestyle.  Not as frequently, we have other obligations generally.\n\nI think passing out at a friends house after a night of drinking counts, and that's pretty popular in your 20s.  \n\nPeople just aren't as social as they were when they were kids, in general.  Like, as a kid you want to fit in and have friends, by the time you are an adult you just want some alone time more often, so that kind of thing becomes less frequent.  You'll also probably start sleeping over with a girlfriend or wife eventually, and generally that starts taking it out of you to where you cherish your nights alone in your own bed.  \n\nYou simply have more energy as a kid as well, and, most of the time you can just kind of space out.  Once/if you go to college it'll be different, it takes a different level of concentration and effort, as does work in any field, and that kind of stimulation is tiring compared to a high school curriculum.  \n\nCOD and minecraft weren't really things when I was in highschool.  I think the original Call of Duty was out, but only like half the people had cable/DSL, so most people were on dial up.  LAN parties happened, but it was a lot of work, as everyone had big desktop PCs and you would have to get access to someones entire garage and have a clusterfuck of wires.  \n\nLike, having a conversation about communism until 4 am is basically impossible unless you are just getting shitfaced drunk or doing drugs.  Most adults will be like \"it's getting late\" before 10, and 12 really at the latest.  Teenage sleep cycles are fucked up, when you are an adult it kind of normalizes and you simply can't be staying up to 4 am randomly unless you are a specific night owl, work graveyard, or are on a road trip chugging redbull and coffee.",

            "Sleepovers are way more fun when you\u2019re a kid and adults do all the real work.\n\nAs someone who loves to host parties, I used to let people crash at my house all the time as an adult and/or invite friends to sleep over. I definitely had the college house, the post-college apartment, and the grad school house that everyone wanted to crash at. However, it gets really old. At this point between guest rooms, couches, and air mattresses my partner and I could easily host 16 adult guest and everyone would have a comfortable place to sleep. But, that\u2019s 16+ spare towels to wash, 10+ sets of sheets to wash, staying up late to make sure everyone is comfortable, getting up early to make breakfast and be a good hostess, etc. Hosting adults overnight, in my experience, means making sure no one gets drunk and passes out in our hot tub, ensuring everyone has a good pillow, making sure no one has left anything out the dogs will get into, etc. It means being the last one to go to bed and the first one up, and it means serving several meals between dinner, late night snacks, and next morning coffee/ breakfast, and it means waiting around if someone sleeps in late, is a hungover mess the next morning, etc. which means I lose most of the next day too. To have a sleepover with even 2-3 friends over one weekend would eat practically my entire weekend with the day of prep and the day of clean-up and then I\u2019d be going right back into a stressful work week not having had any time for myself. Plus when people have long-term partners, inviting a couple friends over for the night often means someone\u2019s live-in partner/ random plus one is coming too. \n\nWhen I had sleepovers as a kid my mom was the one doing the work, which meant I could have fun. I didn\u2019t have to shop or prep food or clean in advance and I didn\u2019t spend the day after cleaning up after my guests either. Guests also left at a specific time (when their parents came to get them) so the party didn\u2019t carry over onto the next day (I definitely had \u201csleepovers\u201d in college that lasted 2-3 days even when I was over them). When my partner or I have someone over as adults, we\u2019re the ones making sure those adults are comfortable and having a good time. For me, it\u2019s a lot less enjoyable than putting everyone in a lyft at the end of the night, being able to do some cleaning after folks leave, getting in an early morning run, yoga class, brunch out with my partner, etc. \n\nThe sane amount of work and time gets put into group vacations (Airbnb\u2019s, camping, backpacking, etc). But a sleepover at my house is just not worth the fuss.\n\nIn other words, I\u2019m 33 and I want to wake up in my own space and read/ drink tea naked in my hot tub more than I want to wake up and scramble eggs for five before moving my guest room furniture back in place after it was re-arranged to accommodate my friend\u2019s husband\u2019s CPAP. \n\nPlus I prefer my own bed to someone else\u2019s (and don\u2019t want to have to pay for a dog/cat sitter). I assume most of my friends feel the same way, after all a five minute cab ride will usually get them back to their own bed.\n\nAt this point, if a friend sleeps over, it\u2019s because they live out of town.",

Be tortured in varying levels for 8 hours. Go home. Possibly there are a few hours of commute in there if you're really fucked and living far from your job. If you're interested in your health still at this point, maybe a workout somewhere in there too. Do dinner, exhausted, hang out with the kids if you have them, and then it's time to sleep. Without kids, you do get a very generous 4 or so hours a day to do what you want with, and with the exhaustion from the other shit you mostly want to sit on a couch and stare into the void, or the TV, whichever.\n\nSo where you'd find the time or the energy to have COD and Minecraft with pizza until 4 am is quite beyond me.\n\nMost people live in 2-3 hour increments a day, and do more or less hideous shit that they're forced to do for the remainder of their waking life. \n\nBecause capitalism and society as we've built it today is an absolute hellscape, where 1300 people own 94% of the planetary wealth.\n\nThere's no time to play. By design, because people who have time to play have time to ponder things like justice in society, which our owners absolutely don't want.",

But we know a lot of married adult men that get houses at the beach or cabins in the woods and take their guy friend group there for like a week to drink and basically have the adult version of a slumber party.

            "I have problems watching 'embarrassing' scenes in movies too.   I become embarrassed myself and want to turn away.      I guess its just too much suspension of disbelief and over identification with the characters.",
            "You most certainly are not. Humiliation or social discomfort makes me extremely uncomfortable. I am very empathetic and have a very high anxiety level in everyday life so watching that depicted is just not enjoyable in any way shape or form for me. I physically squirm in my seat if I have to sit through it.",
            "I feel this way about cringey moments: I can\u2019t stand to watch someone try to be cool or impressive only for people to think they\u2019re lame! It\u2019s too painful! (Michael Scott being Michael Scott is a great example of this) idk if this is sort of what you mean, but I think I get it",
            "This is why I can't watch The Office, I feel so uncomfortable whenever someone is being humiliated. Unfortunately that seems to happen a lot in American sitcoms and makes them almost unwatchable for me.",
            "You are not alone.  I cannot handle second-hand embarrassment.  I literally cannot watch certain popular movies and shows because of it, especially if I have the ability to pause--I just pause and never resume.  I'm mortified on the characters' behalf.",
            "My brother *still* believes I got scared of the Grinch when we first watched it at the movies (when I was a kid), but it was just the fact that everyone was being SO mean to him and I really just couldn't watch it, even if he was supposed to be a \"bad\" guy.",
            "Certain things I can handle.  Someone mentioned practical jokers which I can watch and laugh at, probably because they signed up for it.\n\nWhen I saw the second Meet the Parents in theaters, I got up in the middle of the movie, went out for a cigarette and then hung out in the lobby for like 10 minutes because I literally couldn't handle watching it.",
            "I used to wonder this about myself, though with a slightly different slant...\n\n I have always been able to handle any amount of gore/violence/horror from a young age, the same as yourself, however as soon as you have a character being berated/ wrongly accused of something that they didn't actually do, I get this horrible feeling deep in the pit of my stomach & I have to turn it off before I get too squirmy/ angry at the injustice... it also happens to an extent with anybody being treated badly or humiliated. I think it's partly because I'm a very empathetic person who also values truth/honesty, so it's pretty much my Achilles heel. I want to jump in and 'right' things for them even though it's fiction. I can't stand to see people in pain.\n\nI thought it'd go away with age, but I'm in my early 30's now & still experience this (albeit not quite as strong as when I was a child).",

My fight or flight reflexes go crazy and I typically have to leave the room. I can't stand confrontation. \n\nI have been forced to watch enough movies to see them coming from far away which doesn't help. And yeah I'm glad when they get that part over with and go to the stabbing and blood. Much easier to deal with.",
            "Take this with a grain of salt, but I read somewhere that aversion to \"humiliating\" scenes in media is strongly correlated to empathy. It makes sense, since a person with high empathy will more easily place themselves in the humiliated's shoes and feel that humiliation. You feel so bad for them that you have a physical response to it. Basically, it's secondhand embarrassment.\n\nThat's not to say your friends *don't* have high empathy, but perhaps they're better at processing it?",

But they are cringy all the way through for me.  \n\nSilicon Valley and Mythic Quest also falls under this, but I dealt with it, cause Geek show.  \n\nBig Bang also falls under this, not because the situations are embarrassing. But watching geek terms and lifestyle get raped like that is cringy. (I guess maybe Police, Fire, and Nurses have a similar issue with shows about their jobs.)  \n\nie.

Does with me.",
            "YES! Finally someone who gets me. I always leave the room, or if I'm by myself, ill either have to take breaks throughout the scene or just skip it.",
            "Nope! This is why I have to avoid comedy that uses secondhand embarrassment or even just makes fun of people who aren't total assholes.

That was super awkward and I felt like I was intruding, lol).",

It's one of the reasons I didn't really like *Three's Company*, even though that's more prolonged misunderstandings (which I also hate) than pure embarrassment. I think the idea that characters on tv will not only be embarrassed (even if you know the episode turns out ok and nobody dies, because you've seen it a million times before), but that the embarrassment comes with its own laugh track, and something the character brings on themselves and takes some stubborn 12-18 minutes of the episode to realize. The laugh track might have a lot more to do with it, as it's meant to be funny to laugh at someone, but it also generates a fear of being laughed at if you do something embarrassing. \n\nOh Yeah, *I* *~~Love~~* *Hate Lucy*. What is funny about that show? Might be the king of the embarrassment genre on tv. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n,",

            "Every time I watch Grown Ups, I hate watching the scenes where Chris Rock and his wife, like the beginning and she brings home the pizza when the dinner doesn\u2019t turn out good. \n\nI know that\u2019s it making fun of gender roles by switching the roles and I know some of them are comedians so it\u2019s not serious, but it I still can\u2019t stand watching it.",
            "When I was younger I used to have trouble watching scenes where a main character does something that would get them in trouble. For example when the main character of dolphin tale skips school to go see the dolphin.",

Like I dealt with a lot of bullying about being a fat kid when I was younger, and to this day I've only seen the D&D episode with Neil of Community once, I just can't watch it. Brings back some very uncomfortable feelings and thoughts from that time- what I'm getting at is everyone probably has specific social situations they struggle with seeing. I've a mate who physically cannot watch people kiss or anything in films, they find it so awkward.",

            "Yes,that happens to me too.\nThere's an scene in a movie called Chappie,and it's about a robot...In some psrt of the movie they start to throw things,trying to hurt him,and he tries to be a pacifist...A fresking robot! And it makes me cry anyway",

            "I get a physical reaction to cringe comedy. My eyes water. It makes me too uncomfortable. Which I guess is the point. \n\nLarry David and Ricky Gervais made it pretty much the dominant form of comedy over the last 20 years. That\u2019s not been great for people like us. The saving grace is that Gervais and David are so good at it I\u2019ve built up some tolerance to imitators like Feig or Apatow. \n\nI love Seinfeld, which doesn\u2019t trigger it. But I can\u2019t watch even a minute of Curb Your Enthusiasm. I don\u2019t like the US Office, but I can watch it if I have to. I literally cannot be in the room without my eyes streaming if the UK version is on. I have huge respect for both of them. They\u2019re just too damn good at what they do.\n\nEdit: in typical Baader-Meinhof synchronicity, here I am 5 hours later on an unrelated wikipedia expedition, and I end up on the page for [vicarious embarrassment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicarious_embarrassment).",
            "Hey there, I\u2019m late to the party, but I wanted let you know you\u2019re not alone. I experience the same thing. It\u2019s like reverse schadenfreude. Instead of laughing at someone else\u2019s misfortune you feel it with them. I\u2019m sure the Germans have word for this. I walked out of Borat, as it was physically painful for me to watch, and I\u2019ve never made it through an episode of the office. It doesn\u2019t matter if the person being humiliated is an actor who\u2019s in on it. I just can\u2019t stand it. I personally think it means we\u2019re at the top tier on the empathy scale, so it\u2019s a good thing. Maybe if more people could empathize like we do, the world wouldn\u2019t be such a dumpster fire. Good luck, and let\u2019s both hope this trend in humor goes away soon.",
            "It's called \"empathy\".\n\n\nedit: another problem is when something awful has happened. I never could get beyond a scene where the parents are told their daughter is dead. The woman started wailing and I noped out. Heck, I tearing up thinking about it now, years later.",
            "Yes. It's the reason I can't stand the trope of \"mean girl who is nice deep down but is a bitch but it's okay because she's funny!\" \n\nLike Blair Waldorf, April Ludgate, Angela Martin...they're just so mean and other characters just continue to be nice to them relentlessly.",

Scenes like when a character is trying to rally people to do the right thing or whatever, and they have a super powerful speech, and it ends with people either booing, or just ignoring. \n\nAlso the most recent scene I can't think of that made me feel uncomfortable was in Joker, the stand up scene where he can't stop laughing because he's so nervous...

            "Yes. I had a friend that loved the movie Dinner for Schmucks. She kept pushing me to watch it with her, so I finally did. Not a fan. It\u2019s basically people getting made fun of in the meanest way possible for the entire movie, and then at the end it doles out a lesson in empathy. I was uncomfortable with the amount she laughed, and it made me question her level of empathy toward others tbh.",
            "Nothing to add up to this conversation, as many described it pretty well (although I don't share everything people stated) but yeah, I also have changed channel when seeing a random show in TV or paused an episode watching a series because of this.

            "I don't have the issue with movies, but your example with the painting is kind of similar to a thing that hits me hard. It's when people work really hard on something but no one appreciates it. I wouldn't say that it effects me more than gore or horror, but it definitely affects me.\n\nWhen I was a kid in school there would often be events where everyone had bring food for a big buffet and I would literally cry when we got home if one of the dishes hadn't be touched. I would feel so bad that they put a lot of effort into making it and no one felt it looked good enough to try it.",

            "Maybe not through the sperm\u2014but I still wouldn\u2019t risk it. Any peanut oil residue on your fingers, hands, lips, clothing, could kill or harm a highly peanut allergic partner. \n\nLet me tell you an example story: I used to nanny for a little girl who had a severe cashew allergy.  Her allergy was so severe that in order to care for her, I wasn\u2019t allowed to have cashews or eat cashews at my own house, in my own life.  Even if I changed clothes.  Even if I didn\u2019t kiss her with cashew in my mouth. Even if I ate it hours before or days before. \n\nBecause with the previous nanny: one time that nanny had eaten some cashews at her own house.  And then changed clothes before coming to work (so no cashew crumbs on her clothing). But before she changed clothes, she had not washed her hands. So she had grabbed the clean clothes with a touch of cashew oil residue on her hands. \n\nChanged clothes. Washed hands.  Went to work a few hours later. \n\nLittle girl hugged the nanny.  And her face came back with a handprint-shaped hive rash on her face and she started having an anaphylactic allergic reaction.  She had rubbed her face, on the spot on the pants where the nanny had touched her hand, after touching cashews. \n\nAnd that was enough to send the little girl into anaphylactic reactions and a trip to the emergency room.  \n\nLiterally how many steps removed from the direct contact with a cashew is that\u2026.?  Like 3-5 steps removed from directly touching the cashew?\n\nWhat tiny amount of molecules must\u2019ve caused this reaction?   Literally the ghost of the ghost of the ghost of a cashew.  There must\u2019ve only been a few molecules of cashew oil that got onto her and through her skin. \n\nAnd that encounter almost killed her.  (I don\u2019t nanny for them anymore.  But I still worry about that little girl sometimes.  How is she going to be able to do school?  \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\udc94) \n\nThe moral of the story is: \n\nThere are people who have SEVERE level allergies. \n\nIf a partner is allergic to peanuts\u2014please just DONT have any peanuts anywhere in your life.  End of story.  No peanuts for you.  No peanuts in your entire household, if you\u2019re dating someone who is highly allergic to peanuts.  (Well, if you care about their safety.) \n\nEven if she doesn\u2019t contact it through your semen\u2014she could get in contact with peanut crumbs or peanut oil residue.  On your clothing. On your furniture.  On your kitchen counter.  On a knife washed improperly.  It could happen anywhere.",
