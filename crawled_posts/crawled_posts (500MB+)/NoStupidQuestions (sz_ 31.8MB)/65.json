            "The way I look at this issue points to a couple of things to consider. \n\nFirstly, if a person is truly illiterate, for whatever reason, we don\u2019t say they can read if they are listening to another person speak. This would cause much confusion when teaching literacy at school.\n\nSecondly, if I\u2019ve read a movie script I can\u2019t really say I\u2019ve seen the movie. Some will say that movies have visual imagery that a book doesn\u2019t have to deal with and I agree that is a point to consider. But reading a book and imagining character nuances, accents, scenes and images in your head (obviously difficult with aphantasia) is part of the reading experience. This is why it\u2019s said that no two people ever read the same book.\n\nLastly, we need to break the elitism that reading is the only valid way to consume a story. Listening, watching, reading or playing (via video game) are all equally valid ways to consume a story. And each has its own unique strengths. I would even go so far as to say someone who hasn\u2019t consumed a story in each way possible is missing a little of what makes us human.\n\nEnjoy stories any way you can.

One more person who interprets, maybe does voices and reads at a certain speed according to what happens. According to how they think it works best. It\u00b4s the same with translations of books to some degree. A book can be improved, altered and have a certain tone according to who translated it and/or voiced the audio book. Hell even the cover of a book (or audiobook) plays a huge role in how you percieve the whole thing as you look at it everytime you hold the book (or audiobook) in your hands. I love audio books. And i mostly chose them by who reads them out. A book itself i choose soley by who wrote it, and maybe if the cover grabs my attention. Thats where the difference lays for me.\n\nedit: spelling",

            "I'm going to go against the majority here in the thread and say no, you haven't read the book. I'm a librarian and as part of my job I run two monthly book clubs, I often listen to an audiobook version of the title rather than reading it because of time constraints. Without fail I find I take in less of the subtleties in an authors work when I listen rather than read. To me it's the equivalent of skimming a book, I get the whole story but I don't take in as much detail. Perhaps it's because I'm forced to consume the text at the speed someone else is reading it, I cant easily flip back and forth to remind myself of characters or events. You're also relying on someone elses interpretation. When the narrator stresses certain words in a sentence that can sway the meaning, part of the fun of book groups is you can see how people read things differently and take meanings that you didn't, if you have someone read the book to you then you lose that. How many students feel they can get through an English course just by listening to a book? How many lecturers would suggest that as an option?\n\nSo you haven't read the book, you listened to it. If you're just adding titles to your goodreads challenge for the year then it doesn't really matter. There's nothing wrong with audiobooks, it's no less valid a way to consume media, but it's not reading. Or maybe I'm just a pedant, as most of the thread seems to think.",

I even do this with movies, but not nearly as bad. I just don't do that with reading. Totally different things to my brain.",
            "In my opinion no you listened to it. If I watch a movie with subtitles did I read the movie.",
            "no, you can't, reading is a complex activity, it implies looking at the words and converting them into information, while looking at the next word and the next one and it's frankly quite tiring.\n\nlistening to an audiobook is more relaxing and the reason why it's becoming so popular. not that people didn't like stories. they didn't like reading. when someone else reads for them, they are still able to consume the book, but they are not reading it themselves.\n\nbut is this question a \"is audiobook a valid form of consuming books that enables me to discuss them?\", or a \"is reading the correct word?\" in the first case, yes, if you listened to an audiobook you are the same of someone who read it (notion-wise). in the second, no, you didn't read it, you listened to it, which deserves respect in a similar way, just like listening to a song.",
            "listening and reading are two very different skills for 2 very different mediums, so my answer is no. its literally in the definition! \n\nalso my idea is that if you can use both *interchangeably*, then you may do so, but no one says they listened to a book yes? theyre called audiobooks for a reason! theyre meant to be consumed audibly. \n\na fair example is that many parents read their child bedtime stories at night, but it is fact that the child has not read it himself. if someone were to ask the child if theyve read any books, its highly unlikely and also not right if the child were to list off all the stories their parents have ever read them at bedtime. \n\nif someone asks you if youve read a book, its not a big deal to say that youve listened to it. you both still have an understanding of the books content at the same level. however, if its a discussion for an assignment in english class, i would say the difference matters far more. the study of text, grammar, wordplay can be properly deduced through seeing the characters on paper. not saying its impossible through audio, just that if audio was a far better and easier alternative, we would have been doing it a long time ago :)\n\nedit: grammar stuff, thanks to u/dngaay",
            "No. Reading isn't listening. It'd be like saying you walked to the store when you actually drove there. You still got to your destination but arrived there by a different medium to what you say. \n\nListening and reading are both valid ways to consume a book but entirely different verbs.",
            "The process is completely different, so are side effects (while doing the actual reading you automatically learn how to write words and use punctuation etc and while listening you learn how to pronounce and accent words so both forms give you something extra), but main result (knowing the story or knowledge of the book) is pretty much the same so I'd say answer to this question is context specific. If someone wants to discuss the contents of the book and ask me if I read it I'd say I did, if someone asked me about my evening I'd say I listened to an audiobook. Saying that someone who listened to audiobook didn't read the book is like saying that someone who read an ebook didn't read it because books are made of paper and you just consumed a digital file.",
            "As an exclusive reader,  yes.  You have the knowledge of the books contents.  If audio is your jam, cool beans.",
            "For some BIZARRE reason I hate that people don't specify that they've listened to a book rather than read it. But I'll be honest, I think it's just me being a bit bitchy and I should get over it hahaha",
            "You can tell people whatever you like.  If you feel like listening to the audiobook means you read it, then tell them you read it.\n\nSome people have a problem gatekeeping books as if it's some holy writ you have to read the text in order to say you've 'read' it, but they're a small minority and their opinion doesn't matter in the slightest.",
            "I feel like nowadays, most of the time when people say they \"heard\" something, they actually read it on the internet. So to answer the question, yeah I'd say you're good.",
            "No, you did not read the book. You listened to it.",
            "Yes. Audiobooks are books with the same content as the print edition word-for-word. Thus, while technically you \"heard\" the book instead, it's fitting with the spirit of \"I read the book\" (since you absorbed the exact same content as someone who actually read it, just through hearing rather than sight) and also doesn't confuse people like \"I heard this really great novel last night!\"\n\nAlso, it's important to note that readers can bring books to life by reading aloud or with their \"inner voices\", so listening to an audiobook book is the base content of the printed book *plus* the voice of the person reading it. Thus, listeners of audiobooks are \"readers\", while readers of a radio transcript are not \"listeners\" since not hearing the radio *subtracts* from the original experience and makes it fundamentally different: listeners to a radio show are supposed to hear a single voice, whereas everyone consumes the same book at their own pace and in their own \"inner voice\".",
            "heres the answer:\n\n\\- if someone asks if you read a specific book 'did you read Gone Girl?' you can say yes if you listened to the audiobook. they are really asking if you consumed the content.\n\n\\- if someone asks you generally 'do you read?' the answer is no. you don't read. it's not one of your hobbies.",
            "Fwiw, I read both regular books and audiobooks. After enough time has gone by, I forget which way I read them, and just remember the content. Sooooo, who cares which media you used. Reading audio books sounds good to me.",
            "Honestly, I tell people I read books I've never read *OR* listened to. I just secretly hope they don't ask a follow-up question.",
            "I (used to) listen to a lot of them commuting to work. I normally just say \"I listened to *book x* going to work\". People normally get it. I have a couple of times just said read, because I didn't care to go into detail and if it ever became relevant I would probably specify that I listened to it, but it never has. I wouldn't worry to much about it. I prefer reading, but I just haven't been lately and audio books let me get back into it. I used to be a prude about it until I started listening to them, now I see what a douche I was. If anyone gives you shit, just remember they probably have no experience in it and their input shouldn't matter much on the subject.",
            "I started listening to books almost three years ago. At first I was embarrassed to admit this so I would say I read the book, but it felt like lies. Now I'm more comfortable about it and say I listen to books and I show them my collection. People don't really care if you read a book or listen to one, specially if they aren't planning to do either. \n\nIf I ever come across someone who does care about the difference then that would be too bad for them because audiobooks are awesome. They've been a real game changer and I often found myself reading along while listening because I learned that I use the same voice for every character, or sometimes see a scene differently/more detailed thanks to a narrator. Most importantly, it allowed my brothers to listen to some of my favorite books, which they never would have done otherwise because they never would have picked up a book in the first place, much less have time to read one.  \n\nThere is no shame in listening vs reading. The important thing is the enjoyment that comes out  of a good story and that you're having fun.",
            "I think it\u2019s just as easy to say you listened to it. Everyone will know what you mean and it doesn\u2019t have the lower status that it used to have. It\u2019s a perfectly legitimate way to spend your time.",
            "There was an article not too long ago shared to /r/books that said the same part of the brain is activated when listening to a book as when reading it. So I say it's totally fine. I read more than I listen, but I've listened to some really good stuff, and I don't feel I've lost anything by not reading it.",
            "I read and listen to a book at the same time.",
            "[removed]",
            "Just my opinion, but I feel like unless you have a disability that requires you to do so, I would consider listening to an audiobook not reading a book. I\u2019m pretty sure that being blind or having another similar disability heightens other parts of yourself, such as your imagination, but the act of reading and listening to a book are completely different in my mind. Even the slightest inflection of the reader\u2019s voice could change a scene in the book entirely or a character moment. Especially in these audiobooks I\u2019ve seen where they actually have actors playing the characters\u2019 voices which is just an entirely different medium in my opinion; like more of a storytelling podcast. Having people tell you how a character should sound or other character traits about them based off of the actors\u2019 voice is not reading to me. Reading is a whole different thing that encourages different Interpretations in so many aspects of the book, from a single character\u2019s attitude to the meaning of the book itself. Another exception I would say is listening to the author of an autobiography read it, which I probably pretty cool and an even more insightful and enhancing experience. \n\nSo, I guess it could go either way. I\u2019m not going to scold you if you say you \u201caudio-read\u201d it or something. Do you.",
            "I mean yeah. Its semantics, you\u2019re still processing the same story. If you focus on the book and not have it be background noise you\u2019d know just as much about the book as someone who actually read it. You\u2019re still absorbing the information. \n\nThe only time you every really see \u201cI read\u201d is for pretentious people who have to pat themselves on the back for reading because that makes them think they\u2019re special. I remember getting mocked by a few english teachers because instead of reading Mcbeth and Fahrenheit 451 as the actual book I read the graphic novel version. I still passed their tests and remembered more of the details.",

I tried to read but couldn\u2019t find time for more than a few chapters here and there. But I kept having to reread the earlier chapter to remember what I read before. A few years ago my wife got me a kindle, and after I found the text to speech setting my life was changed. So in my opinion I believe any way you can experience a book counts as a \u201cread\u201d.",

            "Yes. If someone was blind or visually impaired and listening to a book instead of using Braille they would be considered reading it. I\u2019m a long time avid reader and honestly I like when I listen to a book I process more of it. I tend to speed read physical books and when I listen it slows me down. People process information in different ways.",
            "My husband runs a book club. About half the members listen to audio book as do I. It is so difficult to find time to actually read books but I can listen in my car and around the house. Very handy.",
            "Yes. Anyone that says otherwise doesn\u2019t read books.",
            "Maybe not technically, but in most contexts that's some \"WELL ACK-SHUALLY\" nonsense. Nobody is asking, \"Did you specifically READ the Percy Jackson books instead of listening to them?\" They're asking if you've *experienced* them.\n\nAlso audiobooks totally count for the reading challenges at my library, both for children's challenges and adult ones. Is there a read five books in two months challenge, and you only did audiobooks? As far as the library is concerned, you read five books.",

            "this is a little late, but absolutely.  in this context \"read\" is a phatic phrase to communicate that you've consumed the contents of the book.",

I don't see how it is the lesser activity.\nI also watch movies and TV shows with sub titles on and I read every word.

            "No. The literature police will come and arrest you.\n\n\nI think this is the damage caused by all these read 'x' books in a year challenges (just like your favourite billionaire, because that's what made a difference). Do you read the book to earn bragging rights? Do you read it because you want to retain some knowledge and message of the text? Does the audiobook communicate it? Yes? Well then the book fulfilled its purpose.\n\n\nAlso I don't know in what circumstances you \"tell people you read that book\" but I find it usually in such situation when they want to discuss it or have opinion about it.

            "I say no. Listening to a two hour audiobook while cleaning your house and sitting down and immersing yourself completely in the story are totally different things.\n\nThat said, theres nothing wrong with audiobooks. I enjoy them, but i dont go around telling people Ive read War and Peace cuz i put in some headphones at night.",
            "No. Cuz you're not reading. You're listening. Two completely different methods to absorbing the material. Not a fan of when people say they read books only to find out they're listening to audiobooks.",
            "No.  The voice of the speaker, the tendency to zone out as a listener, the inability to reread a sentence when it didn\u2019t sink in properly, the inability to pause and think/imagine a scene, not being able to see the actual spelling of character names and places which may hold clues, the fact that people listen to audio books while focusing on driving or working or whatever else...  all of these things have impact the experience.\n\nSaying you \u201cread a book\u201d when you listened to it is like saying you \u201cdid your homework\u201d when you sat and watched your math tutor do it and explain it while they were doing it.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say it\u2019s not a valuable or educational experience, and I don\u2019t agree with people who look down on those who listen to audiobooks.  Listening to a book at work or while driving versus having the radio on is definitely a more educational experience...  but it\u2019s absolutely not the same experience.",

            "Yes. When you are a sufficiently good reader, your brain responds to written words pretty much the same as if you were listening.\nAs long as you're paying attention, ya got through the book, it counts.",
            "Please mark the question as ANSWERED",
            "I think there needs to be another word for it, but for the most part, I think you can say you've read it.  People have different learning \"pathways\".  Some people are visual learners, some aural.  However, I think it takes more attention to read a book than to listen to someone else read a book.  I think words form differently in your mind and thus, you get a different picture of what is happening or the context and meaning of the words than if you were to listen.  You still get the story of the book by listening, but there just that slight difference between reading and listening.  I think you're enriched more by reading though.\n\nIn short, yes, say you read the book if you listened to the audiobook.",
            "I believe there's some study that proves there's no significant difference to the brain. You're still receiving the information and still have to use your brain to create a complete picture of what you're receiving, unlike t.v. which does everything for you.",
            "This is a bit like asking \"if I emailed someone, can I say I spoke to them?\"\n\nIn my book (no pun intended) the answer is yes.  At the end of the day, you have absorbed the information and if you read the book you'd hear an audio version in your head! :-)\n\nThe only thing with audio books is that sometimes you miss stuff whereas with reading you can take your time and go over certain lines.  I use audiobooks to save time so not knocking them, both printed and audio books have merit and drawbacks.",
            "I think you do, theres a lot of people who dont retain the info if they read it off, instead they retain by listen. Whenever i tried to read a book i had to read a page back in order to know what happen, or i totally lost the info i read way back, yet whenever i listen to something i can retain the info better. I think theres a difference of the skill of reading and reading just to read and retain info/know the story.",
            "Its perfectly fine with me.The point is that you know what happened and that you finished the book and the \"method\" you use doesnt matter."

But it seems like enough people here also have it that that seems unlikely!\n\nOften the thoughts were a bit intrusive, like I couldn't stop them from taking over for a couple of seconds, but that got better when, whenever I had a thought, I tried to make the habit of pausing mentally to work out where the thought came from, then make a note of it on my phone. I found a lot of them came from like black and white thinking - \"you're so shit\" etc. So now if it happens I try to tell myself stuff like, \"yeah you're not perfect but nobody is\" and I find that's helped a lot!

            "Me and my partner have a similar quandary and alot of people around us are very pro towards having children towards my partner\n\nMy partner suffers from hidradenitis suppurativa which is a chronic skin condition that's lifetime and can dibilate her at times because of how bad it gets, she's stuck with this her life and it'll only get worse as she gets older, there is no cure or method of treatment that is effective. Her mum has the same condition.\n\nIt it's majoritvely girls that develop it, it's an afro carribean disease but she's white British so is the family so there unsure where it sprouted from.\n\nWe've both agreed that I don't want kids becusee of certain lined of trauma, and she doesn't want to risk having a girl and putting them through what she has.\n\nWhen she tells her Close Co workers this or select family they find that thought process almost monster like saying \"what if your mum had that thought about you, you wouldn't be alive\" and while that's true, I think we all have right to make a conscious decision whether we go through with it aware of the pain we may be inflicting on a child if it were to be a girl.\n\nWe've agreed if we ever would we'd adopt or provide through the care system as I went through it myself and know it needs more good people for the many children in care across the country so. But then people say to us \"but it wouldn't be your kid, you wouldn't have that blood bond with them\", and that's just an opinion I outright disagree with but some people just don't understand the hard choice that has to be made.",
            "Often this is unintentional. A person with HD may not know they have it until in their 40s or later by which time they may have already had kids.\n\nEdit: getting a lot of comments on this not answering the question/missing the point which is understandable. I\u2019m trying to offer a different perspective based on what often happens in real life when people with HD have children. \n\nThere is a real possibility of *not* knowing bc in reality there may not be a family history especially w/HD bc of late term presentation and anticipation, a genetic thing that causes those in the family that first get it to become symptomatic very late in life if at all and with each successive generation getting it earlier. \n\nIt\u2019s also been historically difficult to diagnose, with lots of misdiagnosis and social factors that may make family history unknown as well. So I feel like it\u2019s relevant to mention that people may not be aware of their status as a carrier and would be unable to make an informed choice but would nonetheless have children, who would then have to face the terrifying news that they may or may not have HD when an older family member is diagnosed.",

His wife also carries the gene so it was very likely that if they had another child it would be the same scenario. Well, God told them that their daughter was a blessing and they tried for another baby, saw he was the same in the prenatal testing, and had him anyway. Same problem plus blindness and he died before the age of 2. The amount of torture this little girl goes through to survive is so sad to see. They dress her up for every occasion and do photoshoots for Instagram. I'm happy they take care of her I guess but I can't stand that they intentionally keep trying to have more children with the same condition (chances are 50%). \n\nThanks for letting me rant about it.",

Then there's the parents who just have unbelievable hope that it's just not going to happen again. I don't know if it's because they don't fully understand how genetics works (which i don't think this number is very high due to genetics counselors being great at what they do) or they just have that unfaltering hope that the next baby will be fine. I see it everyday at my job. I used to scratch my head and be like, \"Why does this family keep having babies when they know they have the disease, or carry the gene mutation? We have entire family generations with the same disease from Grandparents down to children.

It comes from my mom's side of the family, specifically her biological father. I know because my mom didn't have them but his son from another marriage (my mom's stepbrother) did. When my mom took me to see a neurologist he explained that it was most likely genetically inherited, and my mom felt so guilty because she had no idea what it was or how transferable it would be. Luckily, medication given early in in childhood helps to control them. I have been off my meds since 14 or 15, and haven't had a seizure since years before that.

Before the cultural and societal revolution of the late 60s, people finished their education, married and had kids. That's just how it was and breaking away from that norm took a lot so most people went along. And if you had diseases in your family, that sucked but the pressure to conform was so strong people saw it as a risk you had to take. Also, medicine just a few decades ago was pretty much the doctor saying \"you're gonna die. That's a bummer\". People watched their kids die from diabetes which is totally manageble for most patients today. Before vaccines, anti-biotics and anaesthesia, people died younger and death and diseases was more present. We were much more used to people suddenly getting sick and dying, whereas nowadays people get all \"no, this is wrong, this shouldn't be, make it stop!\" but back when there wasn't much you could do people said \"life is cruel but what can you do?\" They accepted the reality that a lot of diseases were untreatable and an unfortunate, sad, inevitable part of life.",

Chronic pain started at age 13 for me.\n\nIn Facebook groups or subreddits for this specific illness there are so many pepole who know they have that illness and purposely still had kids! Or are pregnan, or planning to do it anyway.   \nOften multiple kids too, and there is always one or more that has the illness too. Incredibly selfish!

            "My father had huntingtons. \n\nHe had no idea the condition existed until he was in his 50's it killed him in his 60's. I was 12 when he was diagnosed and seeing his relatively youthfull and speedy deterioration was highly influential to me. When I became pregnant accidentally the deciding factor in whether to terminate or not was my baby's status. I still do not know my own as I've not looked, but a needle to my womb to get some of the amniotic fluid (roof of mouth hurts more, interestingly) has given me proof that my son will never get it. With his count it is unlikely that his children will get it but his grandchildren may. That's high risk of people forgetting, specially if I don't have it, so I've got a series of letters written detailing my father's rapid deterioration urging them to get tested prior to having their own children as well as keeping it within active family memory as much as possible.\n\n\nWith a my trauma aside, I can see how those with family history of later onset or less aggressive forms of huntingtons would be easily alright with having children. You get to a certain age and it all mixes together with the standard dementia risks. There's ways of living healthily to slow its path, particularly if you start young, so it would be not a big deal for many.   \nThere's also people who are far more life positive than myself and would actively want to have lived their life even if it includes huntingtons at the end, even if that end is far earlier and more difficult than they'd like. \nMy plan since I was 13 is to just off myself before the symptoms get too bad for me to be able to off myself independently.

Selfishness is inherently human. \n\nTaking that approach it makes a lot of sense of why people do things that seems contradictory to logic. Some people have kids for the ring reasons hoping it will bring happiness to their already existing unhappy life for example. \n\nSo why do people who knowingly have HD have kids knowing the full consequences of their actions..?

            "Some don't.  Some feel that a shortened life is better than no life at all, and suppose that a perhaps fifty year life would nonetheless be worth living.  Some are willing to risk having a child with a shortened lifespan for the chance of having a child with a normal lifespan.\n\nAnd, of course, it depends on the disease.  People in my family have a reasonable chance of coming down with Alzheimer's in their late seventies or early eighties, but, if they don't, often live well into their nineties.  Most of my family members feel that a life in which a person has a good chance of living reasonably well for a reasonable amount of time is worth having, and didn't consider Alzheimer's among the factors when choosing whether to have kids or not.\n\nOr Downs Syndrome - not a genetic disease, but reflects some of the same issues.  People have been able to test for Downs Syndrome for near sixty years, and for most of that time, it has generally been considered acceptable to abort such a fetus.  And thirty years ago, a child with Downs Syndrome was unlikely to live much past 25 years old.  Nowadays, with more knowledge and medical skill, that has more than doubled, and many people with Downs Syndrome live until near sixty.  My wife's uncle lived to 54, twenty years longer than anyone expected when they found out he had Downs.\n\nSo for thirty years, people had to decide whether it was worth it to have a child who wouldn't live until thirty.  And many of them did decide to, because those children with Downs could have a good quality of life for those 25 years.\n\nOn the other hand, with Tay-Sachs Disease, a child will live for only three to five years, much of that in great pain.\n\nSo depending what sort of genetic disease we are discussing, and what the expected progression is, and what kind of quality of life the child could be expected to have, many different choices may be appropriate.\n\nIt seems clear from your question that, for Huntington's, you would very clearly choose not to have children.  I probably would make the same choice as you. But I can understand how other people might consider a life with Huntington's to be worth having.",
            "As someone with a parent that has Huntington's, and who has tested with a repeat of 37 (same as mother), let's talk about some of the reasons. I'm also pretty involved in the HD community so I have a few perspectives to offer.  \n\n\n1. People see 50/50 and think it's just as likely they won't have than they won't. They think about the chances in a positive way instead of a negative one.\n2. There is a lot of great research going on right now and because the HD gene is identified there is the potential for a cure or treatment for HD. \n3. People often only think of life being great if you live long instead of what you do in that life. I'd rather have the chance at enjoying life for 30-50+ years than have no chance at all. Just because someone has HD doesn't mean their life is over. There are so many different ways to die before HD even got the chance. \n4. HD has such a wide range of results. I've seen people in their 70s with it and you could barely tell. I've seen 30 year olds that are on the brink of death. You can't say for sure the course of action that will be taken, Though most follow similar paths.\n5. Many don't know because HD isn't relatively common and you don't die from HD, you die from complications from HD. It was often misdiagnosed or not diagnosed at all if a parent was killed before symptoms. Also, families hate talking about this kind of thing and many don't even know they have the potential to have it until they get symptoms and it is accurately diagnosed. \n6. People just want kids and don't care about the repercussions. \n\nFor me personally, I would probably fall in #3. Having HD isn't the end of the world. You can still live a fantastic life if you want. \n\nHope that helps. Feel free to ask any questions.",

            "Many people who know don't care enough, to be frank. What they want is more important to them than the welfare of their kids. Most people don't consider their children as fully think and feeling human beings before giving them life. Some men just want to spread their seed, some women just want someone who will love them. Neither of those are good reasons to create a life but, they do it anyway.\n\nPeople tend to think of babies, not small humans that grow into adults. They think about having a baby. It doesn't occur to them if they can financially provide for their child and give them opportunities to engage in hobbies and find out what they enjoy. They don't consider if they can morally provide for their child and teach them how to be a good person who contributes to society. They don't assess if they can emotionally provide for their child, with capacity to support and uplift their child to grow their self esteem and know how to navigate difficulties in life.\n\nThey don't consider those things, so why would it matter if they could give the child an extremely difficult life that will hinder their ability to cope and segregate them from their peers? In general, I think it comes down to having a baby and that is all. There are some very amazing people out there who do think of the consequences of creating a life and the commitment, love and patience that requires. However, someone who actually cares about their potential kids is far less likely to have any if they know there's a reasonable chance they are going to cause them harm. \n\nThis is probably why the question is why do people have children knowing they will probably cause them harm, rather than why don't people have kids when they will probably cause them harm.

Personally, I think it can be incredibly selfish to knowingly inflict some conditions on a person just because you can't rein in your biological urges. But I don't think it should be illegal or people should be forced to have genetic screening and abort if conditions X, Y, or Z are found.\n\nEven horrible diseases like Huntington's can have positive impacts.

All clear, huge relief.\n\nIf you know that a certain disease runs in your family or a parent has a disease that is hereditary, just get the testing done.

            "Most trans people have something called gender dysphoria. It\u2019s basically the extreme discomfort that arises due to having physical characteristics that don\u2019t align with our actual gender/ being perceived and treated as a different gender than our own. It sucks. This is why we usually medically and/or socially transition in some way. Sometimes gender norms like hair and clothing can help us alleviate gender dysphoria and feel better in our own bodies. We can still break gender norms though and many of us do. We just have to be careful to not cause gender dysphoria in ourselves or inspire backlash by others for doing so. Hope this helped!",
            "another little perspective for you! early in my transition, i did switch from being a very non-conforming \"lesbian,\" to trying to dress like a masculine man. the reason wasn't because i wanted to fit society's ideal of a man, it was because i had a very \"female\" look, and my confidence was so fragile at the time that leaning into stereotypes was preferable, bc at least people would instinctively use the right pronouns. now, i've been on hormones 3 years and i pass as male 100% of time, have a beard and all that. BUT! i dress way more to my own tastes now, i've grown my hair out to my shoulders and i occasionally paint my nails. i talk openly about my perceived feminine interests. my hair is dyed. \n\nso, to answer your question, trans people are sometimes trying to fit in for the sake of their own mental health! not necessarily trying to fit a gender norm.",
            "This isn\u2019t a common narrative in most media coverage of trans people, but gender nonconforming trans people totally exist. Trans men can totally still wear dresses and vice versa. Clothes have no gender! The only reason trans people feel pressured to conform to gender norms is because their identities will be called into question by most people if they don\u2019t. It\u2019s a self fulfilling prophecy, because if gender norms didn\u2019t exist in the first place they wouldn\u2019t feel pressured to do so.",
            "I struggled with this too. I used to say that I felt trans equality and modern feminism couldn't both exist, because in my mind they directly contradicted each other. It's actually a common misconception for cis people to have, from what I've seen. \n\nTurns out I was misunderstanding. It made a lot more sense to me when it was put in terms of sexuality - something I as a bi person am familiar with.  \nIt's really common for people who have just come out as gay to lean *heavily* into the stereotypes. But a lot of the time, that's not actually who they are; they're leaning into it because society has told them \"this is what gay people act like\". I've personally known gay people who have struggled with this. \n\n*However* \\- and this is the key point - they do not know they're gay *because* of those things. Your sexuality is just an inherent feeling (at least, it is for me). I don't have to ask how I know I'm bi. I *just know.* It has nothing to do with my external behaviours. I can date a man long term and still be bi. \n\nIn much the same way, trans people *just know* that they're trans. It's not like they know they're trans *because* they like to wear dresses, or short hair. It's unrelated. They know they're trans the same way I know I'm cis. It's innate.  \n The issue is that they have been told their entire lives \"this is what a man does. This is what a woman does\" just like the rest of us. Someone who was raised as a boy isn't *immune* to the conditioning we give girls, and vice versa. They're aware of what the standard is. So they end up dealing with a lot of the same identity issues. There is nothing in gay men's DNA that *makes* them flamboyant, just like there's nothing in women's DNA that makes them want to wear makeup. But a lot of them are *taught* to act that way, because that's the standard society has set. That's what they think \"normal\" is for their social group, and they're trying to conform. \n\nI'm not saying that's *always* the case - obviously it's not. But it *is* a really common issue; especially for trans people, because so much emphasis is placed on them \"passing\". If they're not passing well enough, they're not taken seriously. There is constant pressure to be *more* like the gender they claim to be, and that can push them into these behaviours where they otherwise may not have picked them up.",
            "Trans guy here! For me personally, I have always seen clothes as non-gendered and I'm not much for stereotypes. Still, when I went through transition, I felt huge pressure from my surroundings. \n\nPeople refused to call me 'him' or 'he' simply because I wore shoes or colour that were deemed 'female' \nI had to adjust my entire wardrobe, even clothes based on their colour, to socially transition. \nWhen people refuse to call you by your chosen name or pronounces based on your clothes or how you talk, it does a lot of mental damage and it's easier to just follow the gender norms/stereotypes if it makes it easier to be seen as a man. \n\nI've had people say 'you wanna be a boy right? So drink beer!'  (I just don't like the taste) \n'Your shirt has flowers on it, that's so girly. . I thought you wanted to be a boy?'\n'Real men do X' or 'Real men like x' \n'You walk like a chick though' (excuse me for not having my own balls to stick to my legs in the summer. Wish I had that subtle unstick-my-balls walk!) \n\nI've been raised a girl for eighteen years, so my way of walking and talking were also seen as feminine. There are subtle differences in the way you move your hands, how you walk, how you use your voice. These are also things I've worked on to change. Even though they're more stereotypical now, it does help, because people don't question my gender or know I'm trans from just one look. \n\nNow that I've fully transitioned, I've started to care less about my clothes again. My voice is low, my chest is flat. I'm seen as a man, which I am. So I've started painting my nails again for the fuck of it, but at the beginning of my transition it really sucked to have to act like a stereotypical man.",
            "Ive always thought about it as \u2018respect gender identities not gender norms\u2019. \n\nGender identities are great: if youre a trans woman who enjoys wearing dresses and being more feminine,  great!

Now as a woman I wake up and think, what can I give to the world?\" \n\nTo me it seems like she has that skewed view of women being the emotional laborers we're so often forced to be.",
            "I heard an anecdote from a gender fluid friend: People who have recently transitioned sometimes go through a carrotiest-carrot phase. If someone feels like a carrot, then decides to call themselves a carrot they feel like they NEED to show how much of a carrot they are so need to become the carrotiest of carrots.\n\nI still don\u2019t know why they used a carrot, but I like it.

            "This is a common misunderstanding of how being trans works. Presentation and gender are separate. This is the reason for why all crossdressers are not trans, because they recognize their gender as being the one they were assigned at birth.\n\nTrans people recognize that their gender doesn't match up with what they were assigned. A lot of them then dress and act steteotypically feminine/masculine because that is what is expected of their gender by society and they wish to 'pass' as it.\nHowever not all of them do this. There are feminine trans guys and masculine trans girls. You just don't tend to hear as much about them (and they also get a lot of allegation for 'faking it' which is why most trans people present so stereotypically gendered).\n\nIn the end one dresses and presents the way they want to. And for many binary trans people this often is presenting as what is typically masculine or feminine because that feels more validating.",

            "I have a similar question, honestly, I've been too afraid to ask because of the strong reactions this topic brings up. But what the hell.\n\nWhen people determinedly say \"trans women are women\", doesn't that somewhat erase the identity of trans women?\n\nAs a cis woman, there are things about being a trans woman that I can't relate to. And vice versa. Does that have to be bad? Can't we both be *types* of woman?\n\nSomething like \"trans women are a type of woman\" and \"cis women are a type of woman\" makes way more sense to me. And maybe that's the overall sentiment. But to simply say \"trans women are women\", to me inherently implies that there's something shameful about the fact that they were not assigned female at birth. Like we're trying to pretend that part of their life didn't happen. Is that helpful? \n\nThe vast majority of the time, of course it doesn't matter one way or the other and the term \"woman\" works fine for all of us (if a term is needed at all). But I see that statement when people are specifically trying to promote acceptance and equality, but to me it feels divisive.\n\nIdk, maybe I'm overthinking it.\n\nEdit: Thanks to everyone who responded - I can't reply as the thread is locked, but I appreciate the input. Here's what I'm taking away:\n\n1) The phrase is not the same as saying \"trans women are cis women\" or \"trans women are not trans\". I think I'd always interpreted it as one of the two, which is why I thought it was counterproductive (like saying it's not OK to be trans).\n\n2) This is mainly used as a counter to people who won't acknowledge a trans woman's identity as a woman. Or people who obsess over the fact that she's trans, rather than just seeing her as a woman. It's not intended to erase the \"trans\" part, but just to affirm (or maybe even neutralise?) the \"woman\" part.",
            "I have asked the same questions. If a transgender woman followed my clothing, hair, makeup, nails, activity, speaking, ways, etc, she would still come off visibly as a man. I don\u2019t do my nails, shave, or wear makeup. My hair is long but unstyled. I wear baggy t-shirts and utility footwear. I swear a lot and play sports and talk like a guy around guys. \n\nMy point is that i follow male gender stereotypes, but I\u2019m 100% woman and feel like a woman and act naturally. But a trans woman who acted like me would not appear like a woman in any way shape or form, so she would have to actively do \u201cwomen\u201d things to be different than she was (a man).",
            "I'm a trans guy myself. before coming out and starting hormone replacement therapy (HRT), I presented quite masculine and played into masc gender roles quite a lot. this is because I wanted to be viewed as male - it would be very distressing when people would view me as a girl. I also had a slightly more feminine body and so I only wore clothes that fit a certain way so that I wouldn't like break down when I looked at myself lol. now that I've been on HRT for just over a year, I fully pass as male now (and I'm also just much more comfortable in my body) and I feel like I'm able to express myself a lot more freely.\n\nI actually find that the most gender non-conforming people ik are trans - a large portion of them being binary trans people! I think that's bc I live in a very lgbt+ friendly city though. people are a lot less judgemental of gnc and alt people here. in other places, I can imagine there would not only be less gnc people, but also a lot less /trans/ gnc people bc, if they're in a more transphobic place, they definitely would not want to bring more attention to their gender and gender expression",

You can't be, for example, a non-feminine woman without having someone ask if you've considered that you might actually be a guy/trans.

            "Plenty of cis males are feminine and like dresses. That's not the same thing as being trans. Being a trans woman does not mean being traditionally feminine and liking dresses. There's certainly nothing wrong with being feminine as a trans woman, just like there's nothing wrong with being feminine as a cis woman. But I'm trans, and I don't like wearing dresses or makeup or doing most \"girly\" things. Frankly, femininity has little to nothing to do with being a trans woman. For most people like me, having primary/secondary sex characteristics that align with our gender is much more of a concern. (That's why we often get hormone replacement therapy and surgery. If being trans was just about wearing dresses, nobody would spend $30,000 on surgery and suffer through months of recovery just because they felt like it.)\n\nEverybody has a sense of what their gender should be that is inherent to their brain, but most people don't notice it because it happens to align with their birth sex.\n\nI encourage you to read more about the topic from trusted sources: https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/what-is-gender-dysphoria\n\nI believe your question could have been answered with a Google search, but the simple answer is no, trans people don't just reinforce gender norms.

But be aware that you'll get better quality answers from a search engine than you will from Reddit.\n\nAlso please don't call us \"transgenders,\" it's similarly dehumanizing as calling people \"autists\" or \"blacks\" or \"homosexuals.\" It's kinder to say \"transgender people\" :)\n\nTL;DR: no\n\nEdit: Also nonbinary people exist.

            "Genders don't exist. The roles were always related to sex (therefore sex roles) and as long as people keep reinforcing them, they're always going to exist. The idea of genders doesn't explain anything that isn't explainable already with just the concept of sex and sex roles or personality and related stuff like adaptation and imprinting. Therefore there's never been a reason for genders to be a thing. It's literally an overcomplication of a system that doesn't need it. You can be a female (biologically, as there's no other way to define a female) and still behave exactly how a stereotypical men would or dress the same way, or the opposite, or any mix. The real thing we should do is abandoning the idea of sex roles altogether except when they're clearly needed for biological purposes (e.g. pregnancy, periods,\u2026). Stop roleplaying, life is no Sims game. You are what nature decided, but you can STILL do whatever the fuck you want with it. Getting offended by a correct pronoun?

            "I slightly agree in concept. The entire concept of gender is entirely socially defined. There's nothing innate about it. We define genders of male, female, or anything else by how society defines them. For example, we might define certain personality or physical characteristics as masculine or feminine, when really there's no real reason to do so. So when people recognize certain characteristics in themselves, either physically or in their personality, that don't align with how society has stereotypes the gender that matches their sex, they feel the need to define themselves as something different.\n\nI think ultimately the world would be better if there were no such thing as the concept of gender, because these stereotypes result in people being uncomfortable in their own skin and feeling the need to redefine themselves, and I wish people didn't have to go through that feeling. I'm grateful that we as a society have come up with a way to handle this disassociation, but I do think that if we could eliminate the stereotypes that cause that in the first place, the world would probably be a better place.",
            "The truth is, yes. They do. Because gender attributed values (which i think is what you mean by norms) do exist. Also, it's completely fine if a person doesn't align with them. But also there is no need to denounce people who DO align with them. People who say gender is a social construct are equivalent to people who think that sexuality and gender dysphoria are caused by external causes or depend upon person's decisions, they're not. We are all born these things.",
            "no, I don't think so as that's almost like saying if a woman wears a dress because she likes it that's reinforcing gender norms.\n\nI see where your thought process is but the person is just feeling more comfortable in their body and wants to be on the gender spectrum that their mind fits with :)\n\nhoped this helped",
            "There\u2019s a ted talk of a trans guy I believe? (I watched it long ago), he goes into detail over this. \n\nGender is a cultural thing, so unless you\u2019re actually showing \u201cfeminine\u201d characteristics (as in boobs, face, etc) you won\u2019t be treated as such.",
            "I'm not sure if it's \"reinforcement\" as such, because they still exist very outside societal norms regardless of their presentation by virtue of being trans.  But the trans experience is very heavily reliant on societal norms and perceptions of gender to make them realize they may be dysphoric in the first place.\n\nI'm non-binary and androgynous; I consider myself kind of in the middle.  I was raised as a girl but started feeling dysphoric around puberty and also really hated dresses, makeup, etc.  There were a few \"girly\" toys and series I liked, but in terms of outward presentation, it was all jeans and t-shirts for me.  When I was a teenager I started really hating the concept of labels in general, including gender, and tried to even not use pronouns for myself if I could get away with it because it just all seemed arbitrary to me, like you said.  It was just societal expectation, why bother with it??\n\nThen I started getting trans girl friends and saw how happy they were identifying as she/her, wearing dresses, looking cute, etc.  As someone who was really dysphoric to that I couldn't really grasp their happiness but it also made me understand that labels can be a good thing for people that strongly identify with them.  What I saw as a confusing, arbitrary mess was actually incredibly validating to these friends in their presentation and identity.\n\nI think, in a society where everyone was a \"blank slate\" at birth and could choose freely how they wanted to present, we would still see people take up roles that seem \"traditionally feminine\" or \"traditionally masculine\" to our society now.  The difference is that they would be *choosing* that for themselves and could experiment with it without repercussions, instead of being shoved into little boxes immediately after birth that may make them feel uncomfortable.\n\nI feel like if we had gender be a more freeform expression, we would see a lot more people falling between the binary and experimenting instead of on one extreme or the other.",
            "well that hypothetical is a generalization of all transgender people. There are some transgender people who do not dress like the opposite sex but still identify as it",
            "Non-binary person here. There are 3 concepts you have to understand:\n\n1. Gender Identity - how you feel / identify\n\n2. Gender presentation - how you present\n\n3. Gender performativity - how you act\n\n\nAll 3 concepts are related typically, but can be 'exclusive'. Trans people don't transition because of their gender _presentation_ not matching with their identity - that is, they don't transition because they want to wear dresses like you're saying. You're totally allowed to wear dresses as an amab cis person. They transition because of their gender _identity_, because they feel their assigned gender does not match what they feel inside of them. \n\nThis can be kind of hard for cis people to understand because they don't experience gender dysphoria or a feeling that they're something else, which is understandable. Very simply put we feel dysphoric (bad) when related to our assigned gender, and euphoric (good) when related to our real gender.\n\nTrans people also try to wear clothes that match their gender so other people identify them as such. It's hurtful to be misgendered.\n\nTl;dr: Trans people don't transition because of gender presentation or performativity, they transition because of identity.\n\nFeel free to ama. That goes to anyone.",
            "For me, its not really about gender norms. There's actually nothing wrong with conforming gender norms; the problems start when gender norms are forced on people who don't want them, or people are criticized for acting outside of their expected gender norms. So no, it doesn't really matter if a transwoman acts super feminine just like it doesn't matter if a ciswoman acts super femine; its about having the right to make that choice and not be judged for it. And there are pleeenty of gender nonconforming transpeople out there as well. \n\nJust as a note, in your example you refer to the person with male pronouns. If the person is transfemme, its better to use feminine pronouns in your example. Its a small thing, but it sticks out like a sore thumb for transpeople as it reinforces the idea that transwomen are actually men, which of course is not true.",
            "Just wanted to pop in and say that there are many \"biological\" (men and women) who cross dress/do drag and don't want to transition. \n\nSo there could be a gay male who cross dresses. They have no interests in transitioning to female, they don't feel like they have the wrong genitals. \n\nI may be using outdated terms and don't want to offend or misrepresent anyone but I just wanted to make a distinction between trans and cross dressing since OP put clothes as a part of their post.\n\nTo my understanding clothes are an expression of ones self, and it's usually just what people feel comfortable in, it's usually a blend(male/female clothes) and it's also at different times(only cross dress when going out in the evening, etc).",

            "If you think about it, they sort of do. It's their own \"gender norm\" that they enforce upon society.\n\nI know it sounds bad when its said like that. However, its great since it offers a broaden spectrum and offers complete acceptance of people who wish to identify as the see fit.",
            "Not all transgender people conform with the binary as well. I\u2019ve met trans people who consider themself trans, get some surgeries, go by they/them, and take influence from both binaries.\n\nFor example I recently met someone, they were AFAB. They now go by they/them and have an androgynous name. They had a double mastectomy but not bottom surgery. Their hair tends to be cut more masculine. Their clothes while tend to be masculine in silhouette have very feminine patterns on them. Not all transgender persons look the same.",
            "hi, just a really quick note that i don't mean to be taken as offensive at all, your question is obviously very valid and i'm sure many people have already said this, but in the future please try to not refer to transgender people as \"a transgender,\" you can say \"being transgender\" or \"a transgender person\" but to state \"a transgender\" feels very objectifying/weaponizing and is often used by alt right people to stigmatize the category",
            "You're missing the point entirely.                  \n>He could still be his own person - and identify as his biological sex (male) that is feminine and likes dresses.             \n                     \nTransgender people don't identify as their biological sex, that is the whole thing, it's not a choice. \n                   \nAs someone pointed out being transgender isn't always black and white, its a spectrum.",
            "I think you\u2019ll find the harder you try to nail down what gender is the more difficult it will be to find an answer; which is lowkey unsettling at first but honestly super liberating. Gender is just a lot of random and contradicting expectations, and like religion, some people find comfort in it while others are just fine without it! Do your own thing and let others do their own thing and we\u2019ll all be happy.",
            "Yes? Not everyone subscribes to one or more of the myriad of befuddling gender theories.\n\nMost have simple gender dysphoria. So they transition to tackle the dysphoria",
            "There are many people who fall into categories other than the established male and female norms. There are plenty of people who don\u2019t feel that they must conform, so they don\u2019t perform femininity or perform masculinity as defined by society. There are people who call themselves agender, non-binary, gender non-conforming, or by other titles or descriptions. And that choice is for the individual to make, regardless of what standards or norms it enforces or challenges. \n\nYou seem to be conflating the performance of femininity with the feeling of actually being female. People who identify as female can be biologically female, male, or intersex. The thing they all have in common is a female identity. They may dress in a variety of ways, but if they say they are female, then they are female. \n\nFor more information, here are some links. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/5AF7Qv-ughQ\n\nhttps://youtu.be/TxtEeHGfSpQ\n\nhttps://youtu.be/8b4MZjMVgdk",
            "In my talks with Transgender experts, this isn't totally how this works.\n\nOften, especially for them, gender and identification are a spectrum. Some of them only want a change in identification, some of them want surgical operations, some of them don't want anything but still identify as transgender. In my experience with Transgender people, this is something very unspecified. Some may be gender-conformant, some may be non-conformant. I know some trans men that love to wear accessories (lots of them), I've talked to a few trans women ones that aren't really bothered with their low voice. There are all sorts of people and this range is way more spectral than the binary system.\n\nOne very, very, very important thing however to remember is that at least where I live (Germany), it's very, very bad to speak of a \"gender transformation\", we speak of a \"gender assimilation\", as it's never a night-to-day switch to a completely opposite gender identity but rather a repositioning on the spectrum of where they want to be with their identification.",
            "Something that I don't see mentioned here yet is that presenting outside the binary can bring on a litany of issues for the person. Many trans people don't want to look like they are trans, because they want to enjoy the invisibility that comes with conforming to society like everyone else. It is a heavy job for one person to reject the gender binary on their own. Also in regards to your example, if he simply likes dresses and feels more feminine, he is likely not trans. If he could still identify as his biological sex, that means he does not resent it or feel completely alienated by it. Identifying with something is not really a choice, you just identify with it from an innate feeling.",
            "A ton of cis men wear dresses.  A ton of trans men wear dresses.  Gender is more of a personal introspective thing than anything else.",
            "I would like to put out there that gender norms aren't inherently bad. At least that's my opinion.",
            "Yeah, I'm female, I never wear dresses or makeup, but I dress to feel like me\n\nThe trans women often dress more \"girly\" than me, I hope it's not because they feel they have to measure up to an idealized version of femininity \n\nI guess it means that being in between genders is not desirable. Meanwhile androgeny can be pretty cool.",
            "The fact that gender is a construct and preference is a spectrum is not a bad thing. It\u2019s just a fact of life. The oppressive and damaging results of gender norms come from forced gender roles and societal expectations. When someone has the power to make their own decision and choose for themselves which gender construction they want, that\u2019s a good thing. We all do it. Most people tend to simply pick the gender construct that they are born into and raised as, but some people never feel comfortable within that construct so they seek out a different one. To each their own.",
            "That's what I always think! I'm no expert and I couldn't care less what you want to do or be to be happy but I feel like ending gender norms and normalizing changing sexes are opposing ideas.",
            "This is probably going to get buried, but here it goes.\n\nAdditionally to some very informative comments,  I want to add  that just because some of us don\u2019t identify with the stablished gender roles, doesn\u2019t mean no one does. The key is accepting that these are made up roles and everyone should be free to choose what makes them happy .",
            "Hey! \n\nI'm a transwoman here. I hear what you're saying, it is quite confusing. \n\nNot all transgender people do, as other commenters pointed out. \n\nBeing \"trans\" has kind of evolved from a term \"transsexual\" which meant \"from one sex to another\" to \"transgender\" which means \"from one gender to another\". People have kind of redefined \"gender\" as being something that isn't binary. As such. You'll have trans people who don't conform to societal standards of feminine or masculine. \n\nHence why you have \"non-binary\" people. A good example is a person who once identified as a woman, now identifies as non-binary, but maybe also takes Testosterone pills, but will put on nail polish on occasion and uses \"they/them\" pronouns. This person, by many, would be considered trans and non-binary. Another term is transmasculine. Someone who masculinizes themselves, but doesn't identify as a transgender man. \n\nIt's all very confusing at first. So questions are totally acceptable! As long as you're being sincere. Some people may still get offended, but don't let that deter you from asking questions sincerely. Humans are humans and there's always going to be one person who takes offense at some point. \n\nIn my perspective, gender is a social construct, yes. But it is constructed around a biological norm of male/female. However, certain aspects are a bit silly in my opinion.\n\n Such as women only being able to wear dresses, heels, makeup, etc. Or men only being able to wear Tuxedos to a wedding, being able to grow out their leg hair, etc. There is no biological precedent that dictates an actual *reason* for the above. Those are purely cultural gender norms. \n\nSo, when, as a transwoman, I decide to put on a dress, makeup, and heels to validate my gender. It isn't really me saying \"Wearing a dress, putting on heels, and makeup makes me a woman\" it is \"I have lived my whole life as a man unable to do anything remotely feminine or live as a woman, so just for the sake of my mental health, I'm going to follow societal gender norms so that I feel closer to the gender I identify with.\" \n\nAlso, keep in mind. For many trans people, if you don't put in \"effort\" to follow gender norms. People won't gender you correctly, and will make fun of you.\n\n \"Wow, if you're going to be a woman, at least put some effort into it\" \n\nYou see what I mean? \n\nWhen you have a cis-woman with a short haircut, leg hair, and no makeup. Think of the stereotypical \"butch lesbian\". People still respect her as a woman. But when you have a transwoman doing the same, people are like \"That's a man\". Remember just because a Lesbian is butch, doesn't mean she is trying to be a man. It just means she likes more masculine things, but is still comfortable being identified as a woman. A transwoman could feel the same way, but will be ridiculed for wanting to become a woman, but still be masculine in that way. Hence why you have so many transwomen effectively \"girling up\".\n\nFor me, I like dresses, makeup, skirts, heels, etc. So it works for me. But not all of us do.",
            "Sure, but so do most people. What's your point?",
            "No not at all, tons of trans folks who don\u2019t care to conform to the traditional ideas of gender, like trans men who are femboys or tomboy trans gals, gender identity and gender roles are different things.",
            "They just overthink and overcomplicate most things",
            "The main issue is that while most people are trying not to see gender as a limit on job role and capability. Attempting not to refer to people by their gender and offering equal opportunities. You get people aggressively using genders to defend transgender people. I\u2019m baffled why it matters what gender you appear to be at all. A superficial exterior appearance should always be secondary or a non factor compared to their actions and character. Using he/she is hardly ever necessary in any context.",
            "Yea I always thought this way esp becomes I\u2019m very very annoyed by gender norms and stereotypes.\nI just kinda tell myself that they FEEL a certain gender and not just wanting be LIKE one.\nBut again not something I can ever understand or experience fully",
            "Gender identity and gender expression are separate things. For me, being a girl in a dress and a guy in a dress is vastly different. If I just wanted to break social rules and whatnot I'd be a tomboy. But I want to be seen as male and feel the most comfortable identifying as male. So that's what I do, and it's completely independent of how I dress. If I, a trans man, wear a dress, I'm just as much of a man as a cis man wearing a dress. The dress isn't what defines our gender - the way we see ourselves and want others to see us does. \n\n There's no neat explanation for what a binary man is or what a binary woman is. It's a question of what feels right to you, nothing more complicated. You don't need a Trans Stamp of Approval^(TM)  to be trans. Quite simply, if you say you're trans, you're trans. Done. You don't need to have intense physical dysphoria or be attracted to people of your birth sex to be trans. You don't need to do a full medical transition to be trans. \n\nAs for the \"we should abolish gender\" argument - sure, we shouldn't use male and female as the default genders and there are many, many ways to identify outside the binary that fit a lot of people better, but gender is just important to some people and they should be allowed to live it however the hell they want. This goes for everyone. Gender isn't limited by these arbitrary social norms. Trans women aren't feminine dudes, trans men aren't masculine girls, non-binary people aren't lost and confused. \n\nTL;DR You can't define anyone else's gender for them, period.",
            "Trans man here. Being trans is a lot more than clothing. If I could\u2019ve just dressed masculine and still been a woman I absolutely would have, but the thing is that I was never really female. I was born with a male brain in a female body, meaning I\u2019m a man stuck in the wrong body. For me the only treatment to alleviate that discomfort and distress is to transition. Part of that is social transition, which for me means wearing typically masculine clothing to feel like the person I am on the inside. The other part of it is medical transition. I\u2019ve been on Testosterone for 1.5 years, which basically just puts me through the male puberty that I should\u2019ve had in the first place. I have to take the medication for life. I\u2019m planning on having surgeries, however they cost tens of thousands of dollars so I\u2019m in the process of saving. To stress to people how important these surgeries are, they literally save lives. If I found out in the future that I wasn\u2019t able to get these surgeries, there would be no reason for me to keep living. The severe discomfort that I constantly feel being trapped in this body outweighs everything else. \n\nTo help you understand a bit more, check out [this](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/05/180524112351.htm) study. To sum it up for those who don\u2019t want to do all the reading: Male and female brains have slight structural differences. Scans were taken of a bunch of binary transgender peoples brains, and it was found that their brain structure is actually much closer to the gender they identify as, not their sex.\n\nSo to answer your question, no. Trans people do not cause gender stereotypes, if anything they break them in a lot of ways.\n\nEDIT: why am I being downvoted? I\u2019m just answering the question based on my personal experience as a trans man.",

Those conditions make them viscerally uncomfortable with the genetalia they were born with and the thought of staying as the same sex. \n\nIf I were to label myself, I would be considered trans-masculine non-binary by most people because I don\u2019t have the will/way to dress as masculine as possible and don\u2019t generally care of peoples perspectives. I am, in fact, pretty much just a trans guy who doesn\u2019t give two fucks about gender norms \n\nIt definitely does not help that the media portrayal of trans people is so black and white. Oftentimes in shows all you see is the hyper feminine trans girl with facial hair/masculine structuring and the butch lesbian esque trans guy. ***That\u2019s what most young trans people see and what they believe we have to do***\n\nNot to mention social transitioning; some trans girls start out hyperfeminine to ensure her peers don\u2019t misgender her because she\u2019s \u201cnot feminine enough\u201d, or the family using the wrong pronouns because she still looks the same.

No",
            "I 100% think so. Which is totally fine honestly. As long as that trans person is no longer is a state of discomfort then fuck it. \n\nI actually wrote a paper on this about how when people RP on things like WoW they are just acting out their ideas of the gender that they have been ingrained with. I also found that a lot of trans people felt \"freed\" by the ability to play at another gender. But that gender they play as is just an idea in their mind. It's the conglomeration of what media and culture has taught them a woman acts like, for example. \n\nMy argument also stemmed from (i THINK, its been a minute) Judith Butler who said gender isn't real. There's no literal thing in this world that makes a man or woman. Yes, biologically there are male and female. But our behaviors, what \"makes\" a man (tough, caretaker, emotionless, etc.) is entirely teachings of culture. People who say things like \"I'm a man so I have to be tough and not cry\" are just following orders that a society has taught them, there is nothing natural or intrinsic about how any gender acts.",
            "I think that not everyone who is trans wants to defy gender norms.\n\nI think there are people born female that just want to live as dudes, and viceversa there are people born males that simply want to live as ladies and nothing more.\n\nFor some, I'd assume that conforming to a stereotype is somewhat comforting because, even tho it's not the stereotype society would expect them to conform to, it still has rules and boundaries that help them navigate what must be pretty confusing and scary times (as anything that regards personal identity tends to be).\n\nThen there are also people who refuse and want to defy all norms and labels.\n\nBottom line is I think everyone on this planet has their own idea regarding religion, politics and sexuality (among other things). It's wrong and simplistic to think that the \"transgender community\" is comprised of individuals that share the same goals and ideals, much like it would be just as wrong to assume that cis people all think alike.",

The assignment of female and male are arbitrary, but people can still act certain ways.\n\nIf I want to wear a dress, pink, flowers, have breasts and wide hips and long hair, society has determined that this is labelled woman. Unfortunately, society may have incorrectly labelled me man when I was born\n\nThe labels shift--someone who would be classes as woman today wouldn't be fine fitting in as a man 1500 years ago when everyone had long hair and wore dresses.\n\nIt's okay to say \"the labels aren't based on empiric data but if they exist I want the right one\"\n\nLike what does tall mean? I'm 5\"4, so some places I'd be relatively tall but in others I'd be quite short. Men even more so. A six foot man is average in northern europe but a giant in parts of east asia.

            "The problem a lot of trans people face is that they don't feel they fit society's norms, and the point behind transitioning or trying to present as the other sex, is to fit in line more with society's idea of the other gender.\n\nSo yes, it does technically reinforce gender identities, but that's also kind of the point, in a lot of ways -  Trans individuals sometimes just want to be considered the stereotypical societal idea of their desired gender.\n\nBeing trans, and wanting to not conform to societal gender roles are different conversations; there's certainly overlap in individuals, but they don't go hand in hand 100% of the time. I'm a cismale, but I wouldn't say I'm gender conforming as I wear nail varnish, something which isn't considered \"manly\" - I don't care how I'm perceived, and think the gender roles are dumb, but I've also never questioned my gender identity. It goes the other way, someone who does question their gender identity but also doesn't care about societal gender roles and reinforcing them.\n\nThere's a reason that \"non-binary\" is a separate category to male/female - some people fit somewhere in the middle and are happy to be neither, or both, or shift between; others just want to be considered one or the other, and feel immense stress when their idea of who they are is at odds with what the world is telling them they need to be.",
            "To add some perspective, I'm in my 40s now and came out as trans when I was 18.   A \\*lot\\* has changed in that time to disrupt gender norms in society.  I tried for more than a decade to hold that genderfluid/genderqueer space.  I got very tired of other people's misgendering, having to explain all the effing time and really pushing people's perceptions of what gender was.  I went on hormones when I had kids because I wanted their lives to be easier.  It's not because I feel like I fit better into the binary society has set up, but because I'm tired of doing that work and want to focus my mental efforts on parenting.\n\nMy own presentation means I can pass.  But I still do things considered feminine and I don't give two shits about that.  I knit, crochet, do woodworking, bake and nurture my family.  One of the advantages of being trans, imho, is I get to decide what kind of \"man\" I want to be.  There are no rules for me around this anymore.  Maybe it's a product of getting older, but I just don't care about others.  It was harder for me when I was younger.\n\nSo much has changed over the years!  My ability to be what I am is because other people did disrupt the gender norms earlier.  Hopefully, some of the activism and work I did helped pave the way for others after me.  That said, gender norms are put into kids heads early and often.  I see it with my own kids.\n\n\\*edit\\*: In your example, you point out a biological male who wants to be a woman.  In my own vocab, it's not about the plumbing, it's about the electricity.  I want to be perceived as masculine because I am masculine.  But having someone else tell me I'm a pretty woman and why don't I just dress nicer is a very clear way to reinforce gender norms on a day to day level.  It happens in subtle ways all the time, from going to the grocery store to riding a bus.  From going to the bathroom to answering a phone, gender is reinforced on a daily level.  I do disrupt gender norms and sometimes consciously so.",
            "deciding you are trans is more than just being born male but finding out you like dresses and make up. Look at someone like jeffree star for instance. Deciding that you are in fact a transperson is a whole lot more than just your likes and dislikes along the standard gender norm spectrum.",
            "Not a trans-person but from the way I've heard it is like this: yes transpeople dress in a stereotypic fashion for their preferred gender because it's easier to get noticed as their gender. Think about it like this: if you're a transman (IE: assigned female at birth, transitioned to a man later in life) and you dress like a stereotypical woman you run the risk of people not taking your transition seriously, dead naming you, referring to you as the wrong pronoun if even by accident, etc. Dressing close to your gender stereotype (in this case a man) makes it much more likely people will treat you like your preference.",
            "Yes they do. Perhaps it's a good thing. People tend to pursue different career choices when they're freer. It seems like a good norm to enforce.",
            "Weelll... drag queens do just that. They don\u2019t feel female, they just wear dresses. The thing about being trans is it isn\u2019t about the clothes. I know it may seem that way, but a trans woman can wear anything and often do (nobody I know wears dresses all the time lol), they\u2019ll just be uncomfortable in the things they associate with being male. For the same reason I won\u2019t wear women\u2019s shirts even if they don\u2019t \u2018look\u2019 fem. The same most men won\u2019t wear dresses, or female cosplay, or anything like that. \n\nSo, to summarize; trans people don\u2019t wear clothing typical for their gender because they associate wearing that clothing with a gender and just like to wear that clothing. Then a better question that would fit your premise might be; why do they wear clothing that reinforce gender norms, instead of avoiding that? \nFirst of all, not all of them care about avoiding gender norms. They just like to wear dresses sometimes, and sometimes they don\u2019t, and that\u2019s okay. \n\nSecondly, there are outside perceptions at play; a trans woman wearing \u2018male\u2019 clothing will be read as male a lot, which causes them distress.\n\nA lot of that would be solved if people *didn\u2019t* also ask stuff like \u2018hey, I thought you were [gender] now?\u2019\n\u2018...I am?\u2019\n\u2018Then why are you wearing [sexe/AGAB] clothing?\u2019\nOr otherwise stating or implying that the person isn\u2019t *really* trans, \u2018trans enough\u2019 and similar things. But that\u2019s another thing.",
            "Not necessarily. A girl can dress and act like a guy, and she's still seen as a girl. So a transgirl can do the same.\n\nBack in the day, trans people probably felt like they had to imitate gender norms more because there was a bit more gatekeeping. Finding a doctor to give you hormones and surgery wasn't like it is today.\n\nAlso, there's the factor of dysphoria. If a transgirl decides to dress like a tomboy, she's more likely to be seen as a guy and referred to as such. Which is kind of crushing to be constantly misgendered, so I imagine transpeople want to play up the part so they can blend in.",
            "I think its more *because* of gender norms, that they feel the need to dress (by society's standards) like the gender they identify with. \n\nBecause if they identify as male, but wear dresses and makeup and have long hair, a lot of people in society won't respect their gender identity and just say they're cis, even though they are not\n\nBasically, I think that they conform to gender norms in order to be comfortable and respected (as much as they can in this day and age) in society",
            "fuck.",
            "gender norms and stereotypes exist for a reason when you\u2019ve been denied the standard you want the simplest form of your desire the most. a lot of mtf trans girls just want everything to be pink and that\u2019s ok. let people live.",

            "I was told something that really helped me understand this recently:  However much gender binary reinforcement you see from trans people, cis people are reinforcing it far, far more.  It just doesn\u2019t stand out so much, because it isn\u2019t breaking a social expectation.  Every little detail of how cis people act and dress plays into the gender binary.  Same for trans people, but it only stands out when trans people do it, because we find those behaviors expected for cis folks.\n\nIn general, the idea of a gender binary is a lot more complex than we\u2019d all love for it to be.  We can strive to not let gender affect how we perceive people all we want, but the reality is that gender affects all of us all the time, and only trans people have to consciously consider that fact on a regular basis.",
            "In more than one way; no. Transgender is an umbrella term. I get that you mean transgenders as in FTM or MTF people, but things such as Non-Binary falls under the term Transgender as well. I'm non-binary. To me, clothing has no gender. As an AFAM (Assigned Female At Birth) I am often misgendered as a woman *because* I sometimes wear clothes that are labelled as feminine. So in that sense, transgender people are just wearing clothes they feel comfortable in. Those clothes don't have a label; unless they want there to be. \n\nA lot of trans people who are trans wear things that the sex they were born as tends to wear. So sometimes you'll see a trans man wearing a dress; which is perfectly normal! Sometimes you'll see a trans woman wearing i.e. a suit. Perfectly normal!\n\nThey do not reinforce the gender binary at all, as gender is a spectrum. Some might feel entirely male, or entirely female. Some might feel like they're a certain gender *but* also another. Some might switch gender in the middle of the day, and some (like me) do not *have* a gender.\n\nNow, some trans people probably believe in the binary, and some do not. It all depends on what they feel comfortable with. But from all the trans people I know, all of them hate gender norms. Because of the bullshit that comes with it. It's not just in the clothes, it's in the \"Women do this\" and \"Men do that.\"\n\nThat being said;\n\nabolish gender norms.",

            "I have a similar question about \"drag\". I've been wondering if traditional drag queens are reinforcing negative stereotypes of women?",
            "Late to the party, but the gist of it I would say is that gender is a lie and a trap in media and consumerism. AFAB here, but I identify as gender-fluid. I don\u2019t care about pronouns, I do like that people don\u2019t only view me as a female though. This is a very legit question you put out there. The short answer would be, \u201cClothes have absolutely no gender at all and the actual aspect of transition is more for the individual rather than the public. The most important thing to ask yourself is what you feel about your body.\u201d Which usually has a lot to do with dysphoria. I can tell you as a person who swings from one side to the other and anywhere in between very often, that it can be very confusing for the person. I hate the dysphoria that comes with it. But such is life. And don\u2019t ever fear asking questions you genuinely want to know the answers to. People will always be glad others are  actually interested in something that concerns them.",
            "I thought like you before I figured out I was trans, but it doesn\u2019t work like that. \nBeing trans is only about wanting to be in a different body. It\u2019s nothing to do with how the person wants to dress or how person wants to act. \n\nFor example, I\u2019m (pre transition) ftm men, and I really like to dress feminine and act feminine.\nThose feminine clothes didn\u2019t appeal to me in the past, and I even felt disgusted wearing it when I had to, but after figuring out that I\u2019m trans, I began to like them and started wearing them a lot. I think it\u2019s cause I didn\u2019t want to wear them in a women\u2019s body. I hated the way my breasts looked with those feminine clothes and it made me look like a women, and that made me really uncomfortable. But in men\u2019s body(with binding my chest) I feel comfortable wearing it and I really like them. Same with skirts. I felt uncomfortable wearing it as a child, cause I was wearing it in girl\u2019s body. I hated the silhouette that showed my female feature. But now, I\u2019m really looking forward to wearing them after I transition. \nTo sum up, I want to look cute in a men\u2019s body, not in women\u2019s body. \n\nAnd also, if you\u2019re trans and doesn\u2019t fit into gender norms, there\u2019s curtain people that says things like, \u201cyou\u2019re faking it for attention\u201d or \u201cyou\u2019re not really trans\u201d or \u201cyou\u2019re just confused cis person\u201d. So sadly, that adds to the reason as well... I too am scared of people not taking my gender identity seriously because of how I dress and how I act. \n\nI just want to be in men\u2019s body and that\u2019s all it needs to be trans. \n\nEnglish is not my first language and I\u2019m terrible at writing so I\u2019m worried that this maybe confusing, but I hope this helps a little. :) \nAlso, I\u2019m still learning things as well so please let me know if I said something wrong.",
            "I actually relate to the description you make of gender non conforming trans people. Know that it's a thing, not all trans people want to fit in a binary gender, that's what non binary is all about.",

            "I think it's more a biological fact when it comes to cis/trans gender. If you are trans it's more that you feel like your physical gender doesn't match how you feel, like your genitals don't match the gender you feel like. Rather than just I like dresses so I must be female, like bf likes wearing dresses etc more because they are pretty and sexy more than he wants to feel like a woman.",

            "The thing I've found, which seems anathema for many to consider, is that trans people don't all share the same mindset about how they identify, how they present, and how they want to be talked to. Many buy into every narrative that the internet puts out there and others don't. Sadly, those who don't often face the vitriol of those who do and are seen as \"traitors\" for not engaging in groupthink.",
            "As a trans woman, my being trans is about my *body*, not my clothes. When I was a teenager I felt miserable when I looked in the mirror or looked down at myself. This is called gender dysphoria. I hated my face, chest, facial hair and so on and suffered a lot as a result. Transitioning fixed that.\n\nIn a society without gender, I wouldn't suddenly be okay with having facial hair, so I would still want HRT.\n\nAs far as gender norms go, I probably fall into the \"gender non-conforming\" category these days as I enjoy a lot of masculine hobbies and butch fashion and work in a male-dominated field. But I'm still a woman and I always will be.",

            "I don't really know much about femcels, but unfortunately I know incel \"culture\" is essentially self hatred that's redirected as misogyny, and simply gaining a partner isn't enough to overcome such a deep self esteem problem. These guys need to be deradicalized and have a lot of therapy before they're anywhere near the right headspace to have a healthy and meaningful relationship with a woman.",
            "Incels can be shallow for one thing. They don't want just anyone they want what they consider highly sexually attractive people. They will make arguments though about how things would be better if people who they believe could be categorized by number would date only their number. However there are two other big reasons this never happens: \n\n1) Juggernaut Theory. This is essentially the incel philosophy that suggests a woman's sexuality is unstoppable. To a lot of incels a femcel is mostly a myth. They regard femcels most likely as just not realizing their own power by virtue of birth. Because men who are \"chads\" will not only have sex with very attractive women but, in fact, anyone, the whole reasons incels believe they exist is because these chads aren't just taking the 10's they are taking every woman. Even \"ugly\" women prefer attractive men, and men, ultimately, want as much sex as they can possibly get and won't turn down most sex offered. You have to be pretty horrendous for a chad to turn down sex and even then they might go for it. So the Incels stand no chance even with these mythical femcels. \n\n2) Femcels would not want an incel because frankly incels are full of too much hate to be acceptable as partners for very long. To be honest I understand some of their frustration. Dating is tough. Figuring out who you are is tough. Its all very hard, and the world is changing very fast. Dating is not the same as it used to be and in the long run that may be a good thing in the short term there's a lot of hurt and confusion and people who don't know how to respond to life not being the way they pictured it. I honestly believe most incels THOUGHT they were good people at one point, romantics even, who just pictured this sort of fairy tale life of meeting a girl, dating a while, getting married, having some kids. That wasn't what life threw their way. The most confusing thing about incels though is that they aren't just sad - they refuse to look for any kind of solution. That's what this whole pill business is all about. Its wallowing in their own misery that they have created a community around. But the thing is the only way they could really date anyone at this point, even a femcel, is to get out of the cult and deprogram. If an incel met a femcel tomorrow and with no deprogramming from the incel cult decided to date, very quickly their world view would result in actions and words even a femcel would find unacceptable. No one wants to date someone that deep down hates you. And incels hate women. Women to an incel is like Gollum to the ring of power, he loves and hates the ring even as he loves and hates himself. They want women, they think their life is incomplete because they can't have them, but they hate women so much they will ultimately drive women away. The longest this relationship could last would be under abusive conditions. It would solve neither one's problems and just make them worse. Can a femcel or incel date, marry, etc? Yes sure. They could also learn to be happy without those things, potentially too. In either case though the trick won't be finding each other first it will be deprograming from a cult that is really hard to get out of because everything around them is a confirmation bias including ridicule from outside their circles.",

But it's a fundamental social ineptness, not a choice, even though it's portrayed that way. It's like asking why a bird with clipped wings won't fly. Well it can't. The problem is that the product of their social ineptness is really awful behavior, so we just judge the behavior and not the cause. Incel is also a socially compartmentalized role that people are forced into due to similar personality traits. So a person who maybe isn't an incel, but might have some antisocial tendencies, will be labeled as one and forced to accept their role. Basically they conform themselves to the role and shape themselves to fit into it rather than being an individual with unique problems.\n\nYou can disparage and make fun of them all you want, but it doesn't help them in any way, and that's what they need more than anything.

            "I just want to say that a lot of these replies have really helped me.\n\nI go on for a while. So TL;DR: Religious background made me believe I didnt deserve love or forgiveness. I try to sin until I snap at a kid. At the same time, my Papa was found to have a brain aneurism. My mom and I took him in until he passed. I blamed myself and didnt think I deserved love or forgiveness at all. Through it all I felt like I shouldn't interact, cause I didn't want to mess up and sin. But I still wanted interaction. But I hated it cause it didn't feel genuine. It made me have a habit of covering my mouth. I can't remember how it was resolved fully.\n\n I saw something  that said you dont need to deserve love to feel love.  And I'll be honest, this reminded me of my religious environment that really fucked me up. Theres just things you dont say to kids. Especially if you dont know their background, environment, or parents. ESPECIALLY ESPECIALLY a kid you KNOW/or suspect past traumatic events. Trauma can effect you in unspeakable ways and sometimes feels irrational/crazy. And when I was a kid, it felt like my brain was soft clay. It was very very moldable. Maybe it's just because I was heavily groomed, but if I had something stressful I'd just submit to it. Being told as a kid \"You're a sinner, you'll never deserve love. Not God's,  and not any humans because love comes from God and we already said you dont deserve that.\" That's heavy as shit to tell a kid!  As a kid, I had already felt so unloved and hated, like i did something wrong and I didn't deserve love from a traumatic event. Now I was directly being told I don't deserve love. And I rationalized it with past events. It only added to the cycle. Just added a divine entity and connected it all together.  I kept chasing God's love. If he loved me, everyone else would...right? I acted exactly how everyone at church said to. They taught me basic things like sharing, forgiveness, being polite, how to pray, how a bible worked, that kinda stuff. And I couldn't mess up. Not ever. I was told that I didn't deserve forgiveness either. So I tried to never mess up. Be perfect,  but I remember putting my foot down with a kid at church who asked to have the stuffed animal that my Papa got me. And he was dying.  Of course I dont want to give it to them. I snapped and got angry. Like, really angry. I yelled at them, asked why no one would leave me alone. I was told it was a sin not to share. I sinned, and I didn't deserve forgiveness.  So I just collapsed.  If I dont deserve forgiveness,  fuck it. Why not say what's on my mind more? Why not go all out? So I did. I was not longer the rules and expectations.  I was me. I was free. All because I didnt share a stuffed animal.\n\nBut through all this I felt like I should be alone because I didnt deserve love or forgiveness for anyone. But I wanted social interaction.  But I hated it. Why were you being so kind if you're incapable of loving and forgiving me? I didn't get it and it didn't feel genuine. \n\nI also have a thing about having my mouth exposed. It's because of some bad shit that happened regarding my mouth. But this made it worse.  It was easier to not sin if I didn't talk or look at people. It was lonely. But luckily there was two people I could never ever hide my mouth around or not look at them. My Mimi and Papa. They seemed to be the only caregivers that were stable and consistent. Until my Papa's health dropped. He had two major strokes when I was 5. He was actually fine after that, still worked for a while, still functioned and didn't let it stop him. Even when he was getting worse. He was laid off, and I believe looking for work. But he still cared for me. He kept falling,  forgetting things, eating less, having blood pressure issues, that kinda stuff. My Mimi had a hard time. She was very angry and irrational. My Papa had high blood pressure one night and my mimi made him go to the hospital almost ten miles away. He got there okay, but he fell outside. It was bad. He was bleeding. (If you look on the sidewalk where he fell you can faintly see the blood. It's been about 7 years. Gross.) For liability protection the hospital had to do some scans of my Papas brain. He didn't damage anything. But they found he had an aneurism. He came home and everyone who could come in the family came. It was intense. No one yelled or anything,  everyone stayed rational, but it was intense.  My Mimi couldn't take it anymore, and a few things happened. So me and my mom took my Papa.  I dont really remember that period of time. Not until he passed away. Then I remember thinking it was my fault. I didn't help him enough. I was a very big part in helping my Papa when he lived with me and my mom. I cooked for him, helped my mom clean him, and was the one to accommodate him. So I thought if I did more I could have saved him. Now I certainly didn't believe  I deserved love or forgiveness. I know the feeling lasted through middle school but I dont remember those years.Think about it, I dont really remember anything until recently. But I've been pretty chill about it all recently. It was hard before I was exposed to atheism. And I accepted religion not being true. It brought a lot of relief.

I love coming home, asking my cat if she missed me, talking to her, picking her up like a baby and rubbing her belly. (Yeah, I taught my cat pretty weirdly. I even taught her to come to me when I whistle) Honestly, as a kid I used to think I didn't like animals, but after moving and living alone I realized I missed having animals around.

I can barely keep it together despite having 4 weeks paid vacation each year and get paid when I'm sick.\n\nMy life would be miserable in the US, I would sooner or later just break and end up on the streets.\n\nSo how do people come to the conclusion that they want to move to the US and start working there? Personally I would never want to move and work there, it just sounds so damn miserable to live and especially work there.",

We also get maternity and paternity leave of like 3 months for having or adopting a kid. I think currently I have like over 200 hours of sick leave and around 40ish house of vacation (been using it).",
            "This is one thing which annoye me as a German EXTREMELY. Everyone thinks having a job with looots of vacation days = ultimate life experience. Bullshit. \n\nMy parents moved from Germany to Florida years ago and are 100% sure they will NEVER come back since their (own words) life quality increased TONS. \n\nMy dad has an amazing job which pays him incredibly well, he got lots of vacation days, top health insurance and that\u2019s ONLY the work related shit. Besides that they have a beautiful country landscape (ocean, beaches, everglades and so on), sun shines 99% in of the year, people are way more relaxed and friendly / communicative, you actually can afford houses there (for comparison, their house in South Florida cost 400k 2 years ago, while a house of the same size in Germany within a really ugly and not desirable city cost 700k minimum), I could name a thousand things. \n\nOnly because reddit consists of fast food / Wal Mart / Amazon working people in the US complaining about slavery, low wages and no vacation days doesn\u2019t mean the US is 100% everywhere like this. There are also people living a happy life in the US with super conditions. You just don\u2019t see them because they simply don\u2019t complain. \n\nFor my part, I\u2019m more than happy when I finally get my greencard interview so I can leave this shithole full of depressive people, scammer club called \u201epoliticians\u201c who basically fuck up the whole country while making themselves more and more rich, shit ugly looking concrete blocks called cities and this dark and rainy weather which is up 3/4 of the year. Only thing I\u2019m gonna miss in Germany is the Autobahn.\n\nTo answer your question: With moving to the US, my dad got +30 vacation days, 30% higher salary, ALSO health insurance, additional pension via company and all of those WHILE living in a country/state europeans go to to have a great vacation on the beach.\n\nEdit: thanks for the awards guys!! Don\u2019t really know what to do with them but happy to see that others are also with this opinion!\n\nEdit 2: To clarify that. My family isn\u2019t rich. My dad graduated with the lowest degree available in Germany and started immediately working as a car mechanic. No fortune inherited and no master degree from university. \n\nAlso I didn\u2019t say that the US politicans are holy or do everything right. But in the US I as an individual don\u2019t feel as scammed as in Germany. Here they literally tax you as high as possible in every way and throw out your money into foreign countries to support their citizen during inflation. Guess what, we don\u2019t get shit FROM OUR OWN MONEY even tho we struggle ENORMOUSLY at this time. \n\nExample: In September we will get a one time payment of 300\u20ac brutto which is supposed to get us through the inflation and gas crisis. After income tax it will be ~160\u20ac (in my case) and when I buy groceries with those 160\u20ac I pay 7% tax again.\n\nBasically the government gives us back 300\u20ac from our own money, which is already taxed, then tax it while giving it to us and also tax the half we get after it got taxed (buying groceries or paying invoices). Meanwhile Anna Lena B\u00e4rbock decides to spend +70 millions of euros to foreign countries because their citizens are suffering from the inflation. And tells us we should save and prepare to pay +2.000\u20ac for upcoming gas and electricity payments???? WHILE OUR TAX MONEY IS GIVEN AWAY TO RANDOM COUNTRIES?????\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019m happy and proud we help other people, that\u2019s the right thing to do. But we\u2019re doing this for many years already and leave our own people behind. And this is not okay. \n\nAlso it\u2019s astonishing how some people try to downtalk someone who\u2019s family is living happily in the US after relocating from a EU country.",

            "My mom, a German, emigrated to the U.S. when she married my American dad who she met in Germany.  They probably could have stayed in Germany or somewhere else in Europe, but she was happy to move to the U.S.\n\nI never really asked her why, even though she clearly likes the U.S.  But one day we were flying back to the U.S. from our vacation to Germany and the lady running the check-in counter for Lufthansa saw that my mom was an immigrant to the U.S. and asked her (in German) \"Is it better over there?\"\n\nAnd my mom's answer was \"Yes.  If you have money.\"",
            "I live in the US.  I get 5.2 weeks of PTO (started at about 2.4 weeks iirc) plus another 1.5 weeks of holidays (some usual holidays and a few days used as \"floating holidays\").  I also have the ability to leave work for short periods of time without touching PTO but still getting paid (for things like doctor's appointments, max is about 2 hours every 2 weeks).\n\nI doubt too many people are moving from the EU to the US who work in blue collar or low skill/education jobs.  The people moving to the US for better opportunities are typically the more educated middle class/upper middle class.  They move to the US because, in general and in similar COL areas, the US pays more and I believe taxes less.  I am not very knowledgeable on EU taxation but in the US you pay 24% or less up to about $165k (single) and the max is 37%.  Looks like many of the more desirable countries in the EU have a max rate of about 45-50% and the couple countries I've looked at are also higher on the middle range incomes and jump faster.  Germany, for instance, hits a 42% tax rate at $60k.  \n\nObviously, health insurance costs is a big part of the tax conversation but, in general, I believe in the US we pay less for our insurance premiums than the difference in taxes, at least for higher earners.  For instance, I pay $725 a month for family, which is a lot.  But my wife pays nothing because she is on my plan and the additional 20% tax we would pay in Germany (as an example) would be probably triple that premium, maybe more.  Even taking my $1k deductible and relatively low copays into account.  But that's me and most people have worse health insurance than I do.",
            "I worked for a large multi- national corporation.  A co- worker lived in Germany.  They tried to get him to move to the US but our shit vacation policy -- capped at three weeks - and way fewer paid holidays made staying in Germany a no-brainer.

My brother has as much vacation time as he wants, but can only take a week or so off at a time.",
            "Bro I have unlimited PTO and sick days in New York. You're comparing salaried jobs to unsalaried jobs. Unsalaried/part time jobs in Europe don't have the same benefits.",
            "I'm Spanish and moved to the US specifically to work here. Not sure where in Europe you live, but in Spain it was extremely difficult to land a permanent job. Having a fulltime job is great, the problem is that most companies will only do temporary contracts. The longest I've ever worked at a company in Spain was 6 months, which meant I only ever made minimum wage or less. The most I took home a month was 700 euros\n\nIn America, I had much more success finding a stable job. I've been working for the same company for 10 years now and live far better than I did back in Spain. The time off thing eventually pays off, because most companies in America increase the amount of time you can take off work the longer you work there. I currently have 6 weeks of paid vacation I am allowed to take, and if I also get paid for any PTO I didn't use at the end of the year\n\nI think, specially if you don't have a higher education, America has more opportunities for financial growth than Europe in the long run.",

I\u2019ve been to Europe several times and while everyone seems to have an ok life, it\u2019s missing something. \n\nI can\u2019t properly explain it, but I\u2019d say life is probably alot easier being poor in Europe but being rich in America is top notch. \n\nI\u2019ve been both and wouldn\u2019t trade my life now for anything. Live in a nice big house, play golf 3 times a week, have a nanny, a maid, 2 new cars, pretty wife, cute kids, landscaped pool, excellent health insurance for my entire family; I don\u2019t even really work that hard anymore, just live off decisions I made earlier in life. I live in Austin so just the increases in my home value allows me to sell every couple years and pocket another extra couple hundred thousand $\u2019s.\n\nHere in America that\u2019s both easier and harder to do.. if that makes any sense. It\u2019s all set up for you once you get it rolling.",

Take it with a grain of salt, I'm sure anecdotes aren't a perfect representation of the world.",

Even if I'd have to sacrifice sm stuff, I'd be more than willing to do it if I can move to the place I want.",

            "Hey.\n\nJust FYI - US based here. I DO have that. 4 weeks of vacation right now, 160 sick days a year (and they can roll over up to 200 or something) paid maternity leave for BOTH parents, and disability leave..etc etc.\n\nWe don't get them automatically though. It took me 2 years. I did start with 2 weeks though and they just rolled over lol",
            "I'm a veterinarian in the UK and had lived in the states from ages 9-18. The pay for vets in the US is exponentially better than in the UK. I'm working on getting my NAVLE done so i can practice in the states for a few years before going to a couple other countries and then coming back to the UK specifically due to the massive jump in wages. Even new graduates get a considerable amount more than they would here",

            "I think I\u2019m in a good position to answer this question. both of my parents immigrated from Germany to the U.S. The type of jobs they do are hard to come by in Germany, and if not for getting jobs here, they likely may not have found work in their fields in Germany. As for the vacation thing, that\u2019s a generalization. Not every job in the U.S. has no vacation. My parents have several months of vacation. Well not exactly vacation, but have very flexible schedules and don\u2019t have to go to their offices everyday, and have the ability to travel to other countries for several months and work remotely. It is not miserable to live and work in the United States. It depends on what your career is. Not only are there more jobs in many fields in the United States, but the pay can be several times higher depending on which European country you are comparing salaries to.",

            "Because they are a a wanted worker? Believe it or not there are jobs in the US that give 4 - 6 weeks of vacation, paid sick days, other benefits, and pay really well.\n\nNow not saying that most jobs are like this, but they 100% do exist.",
