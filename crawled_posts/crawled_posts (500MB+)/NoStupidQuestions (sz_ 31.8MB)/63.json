            "Bluetooth works on a \"Master/Slave\" exchange system- one device is the \"Master\" which sends it's data out to the \"Slave\" - usually a phone is the master, your headset is the slave, for example. Bluetooth currently can create a small network - called a piconet - which can allow (in theory) one master to have up to 7 slaves. Not all devices using Bluetooth can do this because it requires the manufacturers to program in that specific capability - and while it's possible \"in theory\", it's not as easy in practice since that would require far too precise work to be done. This same theory allows a slave to connect to multiple masters- but again, relies on the manufacturers to implement.\n\nBluetooth can also create multiple links between individual piconets, creating a \"scatternet\". This might be pairing your living room and dining room speakers together, and then pairing that to your phone. The phone is the master to the living room, but the living room is the master to the dining room. Because Bluetooth is designed to be near-instant data transfer, the actual amount of time that occurs between the exchanges is negligible.",

My friends birthday is in a few months and she adores Starbucks, so when all the stores reopen I really want to buy her a drink. However the last time I tried ordering there, there was a huge queue of impatient/busy people behind me, the barista got irrated at my lack of knowledge and I messed up the pronouncatuon of the drink size so I ended up having a panic attack in the bathrooms. So could someone please run me through the ordering processes, and how to prounce the drink size names? Thank you!\n\n\nEdit: Okay, wow I was not expecting this to get so many replies, thank you all so much for answering, it's incredible. \n\nA few think this is a shit post and have addressed my anxiety in the comments, either says it's fake or that I'm over exaggerating. So I'll explain a little more, \nI'm going to brush over the details, but my anxiety is linked with my depression, so if I have a depressive period then my anxiety will get worse. In this situation I was not in a good place because of my own mental health issues and some family issues that have been ongoing, so when I decided to order from Starbucks, I was having a really tough time. The panic attack itself wasn't directly linked to the fact that I was in Starbucks or that I messed up my order but rather just triggered everything else that was happening, and made the situation a lot worse than it really was. I wanted to ask for some help on reddit, because I struggle going back to places that I've had panic attacks, and so I can't say how thankful I am to those that have replied with suggestions and pronunciation tips. \n\nA few of you suggested downloading the app or writing the order down but I want to go in and physically order the drinks, to prove to myself that my anxiety doesn't always have to impact my life. \nSome of you also seemed concerned about the extent of my anxiety, I know that it's bad and that panic attacks are not normal which is why I do have help for it because it isn't just a sole issue, its connected to a lot of other stuff that has gone on in my life. I find these issues kinda hard to talk about, so it makes progress slow however some of you suggested some stuff that may help so I'll definitely go look in to that.\n\n\nEdit: Most of you are truely amazing and I wish I could thank you all personally for being so kind and  supportive. You're all offering your own experiences or tips and I'm desperately trying to read them all. \nHowever I just want to state for those commenting that I'm not an advatisment for Starbucks or in it for Karma? (I literally don't know what that is) I downloaded reddit yesterday because I heard its a good place to ask questions, gives you better answers than other platforms and has an amazing community.

            "1. If it's iced say iced.  If not skip this step.\n2. If it's Decaf say Decaf.  If not skip this step.\n3. Number of shots.\n4. Cup size- short (8oz), tall (12oz), grande (16oz), venti (20 oz unless you get it iced then its 24 oz), trenta (30oz, only for teas)\n5. Syrup (some drinks you can add a syrup, some you might want to make sugar free)\n6. Type of milk (2%, nonfat, soy, etc)\n7. Customizations (optional: no foam, extra foam, temperature, number of pumps, etc.)\n8. Type of drink (latte, cappuccino, mocha, tea, frappucino)\n\nEdit: Do your best but don't worry about getting the order right.  When I was a barista I never judged people for not knowing the correct order to say things.  Say it in whatever order you want, ask questions, they are trained to put it in the right order.  You can also write it down first if that would help.\n\nEdit: people are saying I made it more complicated.  You don't need to include every category unless you want to.  It can be as complicated or simple as you want.  If you want a 16oz vanilla latte and you dont care what kind of milk you get or how many pumps, you'd just say Grande Vanilla Latte.  Or Medium Vanilla Latte.  Or 16oz Vanilla Latte.  And your Barista will silently bless your order. Most of the categories are for specificity. \n\nHonestly, I don't think Starbucks set out to make ordering a drink this complicated.  I think it was them simply adapting to customer demand and the need to be able to deal with these customizations at a fast pace.  And believe me, Starbucks gets a lot of picky customers as I'm sure most coffee shops do.  So if you go in ordering an iced decaf 3 shot Venti 2 pump Sugar free Vanilla, 6 pump regular vanilla, 1/2 non-fat, half soy because your gluten free, two splenda Carmel Macchiato with shots on the top you only have yourself to blame for Starbucks' complex ordering system.  And if you can't say this in some semblance of the order in which I detailed above you only have yourself to blame when they get it wrong.",
            "other replies have covered how to order, i just want to say - it's okay to mispronouce things.  people mispronounce words all the time, usually words they've read but not heard.  it's okay.",
            "Other comments have gone over how to pronounce the drink sizes, but something to know is you can always ask for a drink in small, medium, or large. I worked at Starbucks for a year, and during training the baristas are taught to never correct to customer, but we do tell back your order in the Starbucks style. \n\nFor actually ordering your drink, it's just like how you going to a fast food place, or buying something from the grocery store, except you have to say what you want.",
            "There is an amazing solution for this problem: starbucks has an app and you can order in the app and then it'll be ready when you get there and you don't have to say anything, they just put all the drinks that are ready for pickup in one place and there will be a sticker with your name on it on your drink",

            "Ok former Starbucks barista here. If you're really committed, here's how it goes. I don't want to make it too complicated but this is how the baristas are trained to call drink names to each other. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you look at a Starbucks cup, there's a series of boxes going down it labeled \"Decaf, Shots, Syrup, Milk, Custom and drink. You'll notice size is missing, that's because size is dictated by the cup so you don't need to write it on there. Size comes after shots. The sizes are:\n\nShort: 8 oz\n\nTall: 12 oz\n\nGrande: 16 oz\n\nVenti: 20 oz. Remember twenty rhymes with venti. \n\nTrenta: 30 oz. Huge. No one needs that. \n\nI think others have covered the pronunciation. You could also just say how many ounces or small, medium and large. Just don't get mad when they say the name back to you, they're just doing their job the way they've been trained. \n\nWhen your barista takes your order they'll write abbreviations on the cup (or use a sticker) into each of the necessary boxes, and you read the name in the order of the boxes. So say someone wanted a small decaf caramel macchiato, extra caramel, skim milk, 3 shots. The barista put that in the order of the boxes of the cup and call it a \"Decaf triple tall nonfat extra caramel caramel macchiato.\" If you know how your friend likes her coffee I can be more specific.",
            "You could always write down the order on a piece of paper. When I took an ASL class in high school, we went on a trip to the city where we all had to act like we were deaf for the trip. Easiest way to communicate with people was on a piece of paper and they were all understanding if you didn't speak.",

            "Hey! I just wanted to let you know- I was a barista at Starbucks for 2 years. \n\nI am so sorry that barista was being a dick. During busy parts of the day sometimes baristas can get irritated with the flow and bad customers but it is NOT about you. You haven't done anything wrong. And your smile can change our day. For the most part we do not judge you, if you're nervous or pronounce something wrong- we don't care. The only customers who we really remember and dislike are those who are purposefully mean and spiteful. If you are friendly, if you are just doing you, or if you just don't want to chat, you're already one of our favorite customers.\n\nWe typically greet everyone so be prepared to say \"Hi\" back before you order.\n\nThat said- here's the formula of what makes it easier on the barista:\n\n1) Greet\n\n2) Size (and \"iced\" if cold)\n\n3) Base Drink\n\n4) Modifications (if any) \n\n#Repeat 1-4 for all drinks on your order if you have multiple drinks.

I'd like a Venti drip with room for cream. And a Venti Cool Lime Refresher, with no lime wheels.\"\n\n*if you are getting a black coffee \"room\" means leaving some space in the cup for you to add cream and sugar at the condiment station in the lobby. It helps to specify whether or not you want room during the \"modifications\" step.*\n\nAnd if you want food items that is step 5.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\n8 oz HOT ONLY - *Short*\n\n12 oz - *Tall* \n\n16 oz - *Grande* \u2022 GRAWN-day\n\n20 oz - *Venti* \u2022 VENN-tee\n\n30 oz - COLD ONLY *Trenta* \u2022 CHREN-tah",

Example - \"tall latte\" or \"grande vanilla bean frappuccino.\"\n\nIf you want iced, say it before the drink name - \"grande iced latte.\"  \n\n\nIf you want special add-ins/modifications, say them after - \"tall latte with soy milk, \"grade caramel macchiatio, decaf.\"   (You could also say it like \"tall soy latte\" but for your sake, get the name of the drink out first, and then say your changes; it will make it easier on you).",

Wait for them to call your number/name after your drink has been prepared\n9. Receive and enjoy your beverage\n10. Don\u2019t forget to say \u2018thanks\u2019\n\nI think Starbucks is closed now dude.

            "I worked at Starbucks for 3 and a half years and I promise you, nobody cares how you pronounce things.

            "\u201cHi id like a (size, you can use their names or SML they dont care) (drink name) (frap/mocha/iced) with (extras if wanted)\u201d\n\nFor example; my order is usually; a **Venti** **javachip** **Frappuccino** with **extra chocolate drizzle** \n\nMy mom sometimes does: a **venti** mocha\n\nA mocha is chocolate, but usually hot unless you want something different, if you dont want a hot drink but you still want chocolate youd say \u201ciced mocha\u201d or \u201cmocha frappuccino\u201d \n\nFraps = slushies\n\nIced (drink) is just that, drink with ice in it. \n\nDrink (standard) is usually hot. However if you look on the menu, and you see for example, a caramel frap, but you want it hot, you can just say \u201cid like a caramel frap, but make it hot please\u201d or just say a caramel mocha if you dont mind chocolate with it. \n\nThis general formula works for most drinks except the teas. The teas can get alittle tricky but all in all its just the same as the coffee but if you want something changed you have to manually request an ingredient in or out, for example;\n\nA strawberry lemon-aid, is not on the menu, its just standard lemonaid with enough strawberry syrup to make it red or dark pink (not light pink) some baristas will know what you want when you say strawberry lemonaid, but if not just tell them its this drink, with this syrup added until its this color (or you can tell them a # of pumps it takes if you know or want to guess, their syrup comes out of a pump so everything is to scale for the drinks) \n\nTea varies between hot and cold too, but no slushies like fraps. So you cam request a hot (drink) tea or an iced (drink) tea. So for strawberry lemonaid it would be;\n\n\u201cHi id like a **tall** iced strawberry lemonaid please\u201d \n\n(Lemonaids are usually iced but you can get them hot too. So thats my mistake im not really familliar with the teas)\n\nAlso for sizes, its a pain.\n\nShort = small \n\nTall = medium\n\nGrande = large\n\nVenti = x large\n\nWhen you look at the cups, venti is huge, tall is almost as large as venti but is considered smaller than grande which is barely taller than a short. Its stupid. I either just get grandes, or ventis. Or just get the venti and do fuckall.\n\n\nALSO they have caffine free options,\n\nThe Vanilla Bean FRAP (only comes in a frap) And the Strawberries and cream frap are both caffine free and super good. Great for kids. I think theres a chocolate one too but i never got it.",

The way you are talking about your anxiety, having panic attacks in public, and struggling to leave home hits very close to home with me and my agoraphobia. I *know* it's SO hard to talk about, but I don't think it would hurt to talk to a professional about the possibility that you are becoming agoraphobic. I don't go to starbucks (obviously) and I'm so sorry I can't offer any advice on how to order. Seems like people here in this thread did a great job at explaining it to you and offering alternative ways to do it though. I wish you the best, and I apologize for this unsolicited comment if it makes you uncomfortable in any way. I am not intending to give any medical advice, just asking for you to seek some if you are comfortable with doing that because agoraphobia is not at all like it is portrayed in the media. I was shocked to discover I have it. Best of luck, your friend is gonna appreciate that drink!\n\nEdit: Aw man I see your edit.\n\n>>\"because I struggle going back to places that I've had panic attacks\"\n\n Having issues going places because you've had panic attacks there and are afraid to have panic attacks there again is pretty much what agoraphobia actually is. \"Agoraphobia is an anxiety disorder defined as a morbid fear of having a panic attack or panic-like symptoms in a situation that is perceived to be difficult (or embarrassing) from which to escape.\" The media portrays it like agoraphobes are just scared to leave home but that's not what it is at all.\n\n>> \"I find these issues really hard to talk about, so it makes progress slow however some of you suggested some stuff that may help so I'll definitely go look in to that.\"\n\nIt **is** really hard to talk about, and it's hard to get help. You said that you are talking to someone about your anxiety, and that's an amazing and brave thing to do. You seem like you've got a strong head on your shoulders and your wanting to return is a really good thing, not letting your anxiety control you and all that. I wish you the best.",

This is a low risk activity (in terms of anxiety) and would be incredibly rewarding for you to accomplish.  I don\u2019t feel that shying away from something like this is truly helpful for you as a whole.  \n\nWhile yes, ordering with the app will let you compete this chore with the least amount of effort, it\u2019s also not going to help you work through your everyday anxiety.  \n\nStart, maybe, by looking up the pronunciation of the different sizes and then read about some of the options available and how to pronounce them.  The resources to help with this are bountiful.  Then start practicing... In your car, in the mirror or in the shower...\n\n\u201cHi, I\u2019d like a Grande (pronounced Grahn-Day) two-pump Iced white mocha, Breve (pronounced Breh-Vay).  \n\n...I\u2019m not even sure if that\u2019s how those names are supposed to be pronounced, but that\u2019s how I say them and I\u2019ve never had an issue with a barista when ordering a drink.\n\nOnce you order and receive your drink, take a seat near the ordering counter and just listen/watch how other people interact with the Starbucks employees.  This will give you some comfort from both seeing that what you did is not that different and from learning how other people order.\n\nThis is a great opportunity to help yourself grow.  You may not feel great about it the first time, but it will get easier and easier every time... until it\u2019s just second nature.\n\nCheers",

You may stutter, or if you mix it up, it's okay to go back and say \"sorry, I meant to say...\" Just be polite, and say please and thank you. Smile before and after, if you can, as a way to help brighten their day too.\n\n\nSo, for example, when ordering at the counter, its okay to look at your phone the whole time if that makes you more comfortable, just try to look up at the beginning and end to acknowledge them.\n\nWhen waiting in line, you can have your earbuds in, if they help, to keep you chill.\n\n\nSo, for example, an interaction at the counter would go something like this.\n\n*figure out your order. Write it down, or put it in your phone*\n\n*wait in line* use music, or play on your phone if the crowds make you nervous.\n\n*get up to the counter* Look up from phone or paper (just briefly, if you can) they'll probably say something like \"what can I get for you today\" \n\nYou say \"Hi, can I please get....\"and read your order. \n(Sometimes, they ask for a name to put on your order. So make sure if you have different drinks, you have a name ready to go with them. Sometimes with orders with multiple drinks, they just call them by the type of drink.)\nPay. Look up, of you can. (Don't worry, if you can't.) Say Thank you.\n\nLeave the register, go to the end of the counter where the drinks come out, but don't crowd it. Stand back a bit. When they call your drinks, go up and get them. Say thank you to the person who gives them to you.\n\n\nRemember, their job is stressful AF too, so they know how you feel. Also, from personal experience, you could have the craziest thing in the world going on that day, and it still wouldn't be the craziest thing that they've seen.\n\nBetween crazy Karens and teen instagrammers getting frappuccinos, you're just another customer.\n\nYou may be super anxious, but they most likely won't even remember you by the end of the hour. Especially if it's as busy as you say.\n\nAnd, if you can make it through your anxiety to try be a little polite, they will remember you, but in a nice way, since a lot of customers are rude dbags. \n\n\nIf all else fails, go through Drive Thru, with your order written down.

            "Fellow anxiety sufferer here. I get where you're coming from, I avoided Subway for years after I had a bad ordering experience. I will tell you one thing that I learned that sort of helps me. Anxiety causes me to be hypersensitive to facial expressions. I read into every movement and build a scenario from there (E.g. they smiled when I said something. Did I say it wrong? Are they laughing at me? They think I'm a moron. I'm making a fool of myself. I can never come back here again!) So... I wear sunglasses. I smile and act normal but I avoid looking at their face. If I'm in a situation where I need info I don't have I just rip the bandaid of and say \"I've never done this before so bear with me while I screw this up.\" It takes the power away from the possibility of failure. Fail first. Everything from then on is gold. It'll take time to master. You'll feel that rising burning tingle but it will pass. The anxiety is still there but I haven't had full on panic attack in 2 years. Also, nobody gives a shit about you. What you'll remember for years they'll forget by next week. Your one interaction with a barista is their 100th interaction with a customer that day. Embrace being insignificant to strangers. It's the path to freedom.",
            "As someone who has dealt with some of the same anxieties you do, one of the most important lessons I've learned is:\n\nFuck everyone else. They can wait. Do not reward their impatience by feeling bad. As a paying customer (especially at $5+ a cup), you are buying the right to take as much time as you need to place an order.",
            "You probably won't see this OP, but when was the last time you can remember seeing a stranger mess up or do something embarrassing in public? Not something giant, just something like mess up an order or make some small mistake. Can you even remember the last time? If you can, do you remember your reaction? At worst you probably thought it was amusing or felt bad for them briefly or maybe you got a little irritated, but I bet you'd totally forgot about them half an hour later. \n\nEven if the order went disastrously - which it probably won't - at worst you would just be a passing thought in the minds of a few strangers. That's it. I think we tend to put a spotlight on ourselves and think that we're more important to other people than we really are. Especially when anxious, we can believe that everyone is looking at us as if we're the center of attention rather than just another face in the crowd. It's really easy to do this, despite how easily it can be disproved by just observing how little attention we pay to others, but it takes some work to try and shake that belief so that we not only know in our minds that we aren't the center of attention but also truly believe it and feel it in our gut. \n\nI know this won't be an instant cure for anxiety and that you will still have difficulty, but sometimes a thought or mantra that you internalize can be the lever that allows you to pry your mind open and start working on improving. You aren't going to read this or anything else and immediately not have anxiety, but if you read something that resonates with you then you then have a tool to use next time you start getting anxious that will hopefully help you to calm down a little quicker or give you something else to focus on.",
            "I have nothing relevant to add, other than this:\n\nYou are doing great, even wanting to order this for you friend is an amazing achievement! You are strong, if you panic or get distressed please try not to be so hard on yourself, or give up hope on yourself. If you cannot achieve ordering it first time, it doesn\u2019t mean you have failed. It just means that you were brave enough to try. \n\nI\u2019m proud of you \u2764\ufe0f"

Kinda like how the manicured lawn originated with wealthy aristocrats\n\n(This is a total shot in the dark btw, but it makes sense in my head idk)",
            "I think it\u2019s a hold over from prior generations\u2019 proper home decorating \u201crules\u201d that were taught in home ec.  They go with the fine China you keep locked away in the glass cupboard to use only in case the literal queen of England ever randomly decides to visit your random tiny American apartment with no notice & demands you serve her & her troop a fancy home cooked dinner. \n\nMy mom got me a \u201cproper adult\u201d bed set for Christmas before I moved out. It has a bed skirt (ok, covers the crap I hide beneath), fitted & flat sheets (ok), a comforter (love - keeps me warm in the winter & somehow cool in the summer), 2 pillowcases (only 2? I use at least 4), a big pillow & case (I\u2019m told is called a sham) that I\u2019m not allowed to use (wait\u2026), 2 little pillows I\u2019m less allowed to use than before (hold up), & a \u201cdecorative\u201d topper pillow that there\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019m allowed to ever use (why???).\n\nI asked about all the pillows. They are decorative only & never to be used. They are to make the bed look made for when guests come over. I am never to use them in any situation other than that. They must forever stay locked away in 2 giant ziplock storage boxes that take up a large amount of space until I have guests (& not my folks - they don\u2019t count - *actual* guests). And I am to never ever get rid of them even though I\u2019ve never used them once in my life other than when she taught me how to set them up properly because I\u2019ll regret it when the day arrives. In reality I have already committed a cardinal sin by using the comforter because my cleaning it that means it will be a different color than the pillows whenever I finally use them. But considering for years it was my only comforter & means to keep warm in the winter I have been pardoned from this sin & have been allowed to use it as long as I only dry clean the cover even though it is machine washable. This is the way. (I have machine washed the hell out of that cover over the years, btw. But I have since bought & am using a different comforter).\n\nI\u2019m told all the decorative pillows are to make the bedroom look finished & adult. It\u2019s \u201cwhat you do.\u201d If I were rich I\u2019d buy myself yet another set of space hogging decorative bed pillows for every day use. But those I would also never be allowed to use as a pillow & would likely just toss on the floor as I slept. As to the set of pillows I have I\u2019m to never, ever get rid of them no matter how much space those pillows take up & never ever ever use them because I\u2019ll regret it when I ever have an important guest over that I want to impress like an in-law. \n\nI\u2019m single & 38 using a twin bed (small apartment) & they\u2019re Mickey Mouse themed. Somehow I doubt I\u2019m impressing a future mother in law by looking adult with a ton of Mickey Mouse pillows any time soon. \n\n\n\nThis is the same homemaking logic that when I moved out on my own & bought myself a nice set of bathroom towels from Macy\u2019s that I liked & were blue & fit my theme, my mother was horrified at the thought of my actually using them. She grabbed the hand towel out of my hand as I was setting it out to use as I was moving in & handed me a roll of paper towels to dry off with instead. I asked what the hell & she said those are nice towels for guests & I needed to buy everyday towels to use. \u2026But I already had \u201cnice guest\u201d towels that I inherited (new) that were white & had a design sewn in them. These were my everyday towels. No, I was informed, those white towels were the guest towels for when fancy guests (future in-laws, the queen, etc) visit. What I thought were my blue everyday towels were actually the guests towels for when normal guests (friends, my folks, etc) visit. If I wanted to use a towel every day to dry my hands or use in the shower I must buy *more* towels!  Somehow I lost this argument & found myself at Target spending my money on yet another set of towels that matched my theme AND a decorative cabinet to store all these decorative towels for guests because there was no room for that many towels in my apartment\u2019s cabinets. Because that was the proper \u201cadult\u201d thing to do. Although, in retrospect, while I still think it insane, I should thank my mom. The Target towels ended up being WAY better than those Macy\u2019s ones as far as absorbency & feeling nice despite being cheaper. 10 years later all those guest towels are still sitting on the cabinet shelves collecting dust & I & any guests I\u2019ve had over have been using my target ones (mostly because I forget to put out the \u201cgood\u201d blue towels whenever guests are coming over which isn\u2019t often). No complaints about the Target towels from anyone. They\u2019re still in very good shape & just now starting to show any signs of wear. The macy\u2019s ones are a bit scratchy & less absorbent. I\u2019ve never tried the inherited embroidered ones. Oh, I\u2019ve also in the years since been gifted decorative Christmas themed towels that are for guests only around the holidays that have never been used because I don\u2019t have guests over during the holidays. So I have a grand total of 4 (no, wait 5 because I ended up inheriting more new towels that matched my theme) sets of bathroom towels but only use 1 because that\u2019s what you do as an adult. This is the way. \n\n(My, born in the \u201850\u2019s, mother likewise had a set of \u201cproper guest sheets & pillows\u201d for my parents\u2019 bed that she only put out when any guests she wanted to impress came over to visit. But very rarely did any guests see their bedroom. And as the years went on we had fewer & fewer house guests due to everyone\u2019s life getting busy or older relatives dying off. When they moved to their retirement home she found that most of her decorative bedding had died in storage & she was very sad. To my knowledge she\u2019s yet to replace it for their new house though I think she\u2019s finally looking into it after a couple of years. As to towels, they\u2019ve always had multiple sets. there were used towels with holes in them & \u201cgood\u201d towels which were just ones that didn\u2019t have holes in them that were put out for guests. We never had fancy guest towels growing up. That\u2019s why I felt so blind sided at being handed paper towels to dry off with when I moved out. I was already a step ahead! In retrospect I think she was living vicariously through me at the time with the towels. She now has a set of fancy & holiday towels at their new home. I\u2019ve only ever seen or used the everyday & holiday ones. I\u2019m just the daughter & not the queen or her entourage, you see.)",

Different people develop fetishes for different reasons, but a fetishization of \"innocence\" and the \"corruption\" of innocence is a relatively prevalent one.  Of course, virginity has nothing to do with innocence, and sex isn't inherently corrupt, but our society treats things as if that is the case, and one of the psychological reactions to this is fetishization.\n\nYou're trying to \"get it,\" but there's nothing to \"get\" -- at least, not in the way you're approaching it.  Why do people fetishize redheads, or big boobs, or glasses, or anything else people fetishize?  It's not because they have a *reason* to do so, which seems to be what you're looking for -- the *reason* somebody would fetishize virgins.  *Reason* doesn't play a role in it.  People don't *reason* *out* what they're attracted to.  It's a psychological thing.\n\nPeople fetishize all sorts of personality archetypes, and *why* we end up with the fetishes and sexual preferences we have isn't really something we can give an all-purposes answer to.

            "Most people who think that are also virgins",
            "Short answer, yes virgins are worse at sex.\n\nSimple answer: virgins are safer, as the chance of STDs is virtually zero (it's not zero, but you know what I mean), and they don't have the experience to know if you're not great at sex (if you're really bad, they'll still know).\n\nReal answer: Virgins are, typically, younger and therefore more naive.  That makes them impressionable and manipulable.  Generally speaking, those who have remained virgins have done so for some sort of religious or other oppressing reason.  Moreover, really it's only virginal women who are fetishized, men's virginity isn't largely valued.  So, the pressure to keep women virgins until they meet the only man they're ever going to be with, and then the culture of men preferring those virgins, is to control young women to serve their male partners.\n\nSome people choose to remain virgins for sometime, and that's great for them.  Whatever milestone they choose to use to decide when they're ready is up to them.  For myself, there is some level of satisfaction in being with a virgin, as she trusted me enough to be her first.  But, as said, they don't know as much and it isn't as much fun, so while I don't hold it against them at all (everyone has to learn at some point), the only people I know who actually seek them out are predators in some form.\n\nMessage to the virgins out there (of any gender): Take control of your sexuality.  If you want to stay a virgin, do it and don't let anyone pressure you otherwise.  If you don't, then know that there is nothing wrong with losing your virginity, it doesn't diminish anything about you, and anyone who cares about that cares less about you, and more about having power over you.  So they're not worth it.",

Usually this kind of traditions are based in macho traditions, one of the points is that if you have a girl who has been with someone else she can compare you with other people, if you are the first one she can't, so it's more difficult to see if you are good or bad. Of course the main reason is that virginity and monogamy was the only way to ensure she will not have other person's child who would inherit everything you have.\nIn a nutshell: like most of stuff related with mating, virginity is valued because in old, more macho times were preservatives and DNA tests didn't exist it made sense, but like most of stuff related with mating it doesn't makes any sense and it's done just because it has \"always\" be like that.",

            "Ok. When you\u2019re sitting down (or standing, or doing anything except lying flat, really) the weight of your upper body can either be supported by your back muscles or your spine. In reality it\u2019s always a mixture of the two, taking different percentages of your weight from position to position, but we\u2019re going for a simple answer here. \n\nWhen your weight is supported by your back muscles, when you\u2019re standing or sitting with good posture, it takes pressure off your vertebrae and the squishy cartilage disks between them. This, however, causes muscle fatigue in your back muscles, especially if you\u2019re sitting or standing in one position without moving or stretching for hours on end. \n\nWhen you slouch, your back muscles can relax, and that feels good, but it puts pressure on those delicate cartilage disks again. In the short term there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. A couple minutes, or even a couple hours of bad posture won\u2019t do much. Over months, years, and decades, though, they start to compress and can cause pinched nerves, crooked spines, and all kinds of permanent posture issues. \n\nI highly recommend adding some body weight exercises that work and stretch your back into your routine. Building stronger muscles stops your back muscles from fatiguing as fast, and stretching sore muscles and tight ligaments feels good and keeps them healthy and flexible.",

            "Basically, when you sit \"incorrectly\" for a long time, you lose flexibility in certain places, and you lose muscle strength in others. Your body does not maintain tissues it doesn't use. So when you try to correct your posture, you're stretching places where your body has stopped maintaining their ability to stretch, using muscles your body has decided to let wither.\n\nIt hurts precisely because you've been sitting badly for so long. Think of it like a kink in a power cable. It's better for the cable to be straight, so there's less wear on the cable itself, but it's been bent for so long that it just defaults to that position now.\n\nThat's why if you ever really want to correct your posture, you need to stretch the areas that pull your posture into an incorrect position, and work the muscles that will support the correct position. You can get there with *just* sitting right constantly, but it takes longer, and is harder to do subconsciously.",

Well, I've been openly gay so long that it would look really weird to my family and friends if I showed up with a girlfriend suddenly. Also, how would I explain to her that I thought I was gay for ten years? How do I even go about straight dating?\n\nI feel such a fool for only starting to figure this all this out at the age of 24. I even have a boyfriend right now, who I would call one of my best friends, though at least he's aware that I think I might not be completely gay. \n\nI'm at a complete loss for what to do.\n\nEdit: I was going to try to reply to everyone, but I woke up to find this post had blown up.

It's important to remember that there is no right or wrong timeline for self-discovery, and you should never feel foolish for realizing your true feelings at any age.\n\nIn terms of navigating this situation, communication is key. It may feel daunting to explain your shift in orientation to your family, friends, and current partner, but honesty and open dialogue are essential. Start by having an honest conversation with your boyfriend about your evolving feelings and concerns. He already knows that you're questioning your sexual orientation, so he may be more understanding and supportive than you think.\n\nAs for your family and friends, remember that their love and acceptance should not be conditional on your sexual orientation. While it may take them some time to adjust, genuine friends and family members will ultimately want your happiness and well-being above all else. Consider sharing your journey with them in a thoughtful and sincere manner, emphasizing that self discovery is a natural and ongoing process.",

You can be attracted to both genders but only be romantically interested in one of them. \n\nJust keep in mind that the people who will give you the most shit isn't the homophobes, it is the bi erasure people from the gay side of things. They will view you as a traitor. \n\nJust be open and honest with your current BF.

Be honest with whomever you desire and be honest with yourself. \n\nYou should feel free to change. To be with whatever consenting adult you feel attracted to regardless of who they may be. Having different experiences is a good thing. You are never forced to remain in a role if that role no longer fit you.\n\nWhat your friends and family thinks should not be an issue. You are not living to appease them. And if they love you as friends and family should they do not care who you are with so long as you are happy and safe. True friends and family accept you as you are regardless of what that might be. And if they don't then you will know that they are assholes and you can treat them accordingly.\n\nLife is very long and very, very wierd. Nothing is ever as simple as it seems at first.

But in a good way.\n\nYou don't have to choose this or that. You don't have to conform to that group or this. You can be everything and nothing if you want. I am nothing. I am not straight, I am not gay, I am not bi, I am not any of the boxes they want to put me into. I refuse to be labeled and given a specific colour. I am all the colours of the rainbow and at the same time none of them. I am unique. Just like everyone else.\n\nBe proud of yourself. Working things out over time is a good way to work out things.",

            "Hoo boy, I\u2019ve been dealing with a similar situation. \nOne thing you need to know is that you don\u2019t need to feel guilty for telling people something that was true to you at the time. Thinking back I would ask myself, \u201cgeez, was I faking it this whole time?\u201d The answer is of course not! I felt what I felt. Just as I didn\u2019t choose to feel attracted to women, I didn\u2019t choose to feel the opposite way as well. Attraction is fluid, and you don\u2019t need to feel like your past was \u201cwrong\u201d in any way. \n\nI think the idea that you should label every aspect of yourself has done a bit of a disservice. Theories of innate, unchangeable sexuality were good keystones in the fight for lgbt rights and are true of some people, but don\u2019t always reflect the human experience. Queerness was something a lot of people just didn\u2019t understand, so packaging things up nicely helped a lot of people communicate their experiences. But of course that way of thinking isn\u2019t true for everyone (and probably not for most!) so you\u2019re bound to run into some clunky social experiences like the one you\u2019re in now. It\u2019s not your fault, and it isn\u2019t wrong, it\u2019s just a product of our time. \n\nThe way society views sexual minorities and the way we view ourselves is still in the process of evolving. Hopefully in the future there\u2019ll be a pendulum swing and we\u2019ll grow to have a more nuanced view of identity, what it means, and how/when emphasis should be put on it. \n\nThere\u2019s so much about sexuality and it\u2019s causes/influences that we don\u2019t understand. So don\u2019t feel bad about not having it all figured out! Having it down to a science is not the goal! Your happiness is, always. \n\nYou could choose a bisexual/homoromantic label if it feels comfortable. Otherwise just own it! People should have no business dictating your relationships anyway, especially if it prevents you from being happy.",
            "First off, don't be so quick to label yourself. You may be bi or fluid. The good news is, you didn't get any females pregnant while you were too young to deal with it. As you mature, you can make the decisions that are right for you. Personally, I think you are lucky to be bi or fluid or??? Enjoy it.",

I identify as bi but even with that I am in a hetrotypical marriage. Just because I married a man doesn't mean I'm not into girls. It just means my husband gets to watch 2 girls get it on. If you happen to find that you no longer feel an attraction to men that's fine. Lives are as individualized as our fingerprints. We may not know what lies ahead but we still have to do all we can to make our lives the happiest life we can live. I hope in time you can figure out what will make you happy. \n\n\nThat being said, if you need more of an introspective look at your life I would suggest doing some magic mushrooms with someone you trust *the good friend with a trauma dump and just figure some shit out.

Sounds like you never really tried to date women before and now that's manifesting in a longing, is your partner willing to let you be open/are you willing to break up with him ? Cause it sounds like you have some things to explore. Perhaps you're bisexual but hetero romantic, i.e you are sexually attracted to both men and women but only romantically interested in women ? I only say that because describing your boyfriend as just a beat friend is a bit odd, but that's okay too, I'm bisexual but homoromantic, I experience sexual attraction to both but only really feel romantic feelings for men. Don't be too hard on yourself, you're only 24 bro you're not expected to have everything all figured out by now. As for what family and friends think, who cares if they're good family and friends they'll understand you've discovered another side to yourself that you hadn't allowed room for in the past and if they aren't then good riddance.

            "We actually do more than just brushing! We regularly check the gums and tongue for signs of any infection. Patients in a coma obviously are unable to swallow and clear secretions normally so there is high risk of secretion build up, two things can happen from this. Bacteria can build up, track down the endotrachial tube used for ventilation and cause a hospital acquired pneumonia. Also yeast colonies can form and develop into oral thrush. Both of these are common complications and so most units (certainly where I work in the UK) have what's called a VAP bundle (VAP stands for ventilator acquired pneumonia) and includes sitting patients upright where possible, regular suctuoning of the mouth and throat, regular mouthcare with special hydrating gels, and, of course, regular teeth burnishing. Assuming the patient has teeth. Although if they don't we still do all the other steps!\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the lovely compliments. Whilst I have a small bit of attention from a large group of people around the world I would just like to say this; if anyone you are with or know is a healthcare worker then please take extra special care of them during this pandemic. It will be a huge physical and mental toll on everybody and they are right there on the front line.

            "Millenials have been trying to figure this out for almost 20 years now.",
            "I dunno, I'm a millennial in the same boat. Right now I'm just trying to enjoy life as much as I can and savor the good moments although they often feel few and far between. My favorite foods, my favorite books, my favorite songs. I try to make time to see friends and family. I try not to take things for granted. The constant undercurrent of dread and despair isn't going away anytime soon or maybe in our lifetimes and there's no telling how things are going to change, so you have to find whatever small kernels of joy you can and hold tightly to them.\n\nAlso, please vote. It may not make things a much better, but it can keep them from getting significantly worse. If enough people actually do it.",
            "Yeah, it does suck. I'm sorry that you're facing that future. I'm a millennial and when we were teenagers the world looked like a promising place. It quickly became clear that it wasn't. Cost of living and education costs skyrocketing and wages not keeping up. \n\nA lot of my peers spent massive amounts on college assuming they would fall face first into high paying careers and graduated into a hard reality check. \n\nI am lucky in that I grew up very poor, and the only way I could go to college was if I paid for it myself. I started working full time at 16, and worked full time all the way through college. I was very poor. I don't recommend this, it sucked. But the good thing is that I graduated with not a lot of debt, into a pretty stable career, and knowing how to live on a little. \n\nMy suggestion is this: It's easier in the beginning of life avoid big spending than it is to make more money. You don't need a new car, expensive travel, a place without roommates, etc. People set up their lives with a car payment, a rent payment, some credit card debt, and expect to get a salary that covers it. \n\nDon't expect it. Set up your life like a poor person, and if you make more money you're ahead. But if you don't, you're at least not drowning. \n\nHaving kids or owning a home is not something that many of my friends and I can conceive of affording. That's our new reality. But that's better than having kids and buying the house and living every moment of your life trying to keep up with those expenses. \n\nIf you see people around you spending money on things and think \"Why can they afford that and I can't? What am I doing wrong?\" I promise most the of time is that they are living above their means and drowning in debt, or their family is helping them. So ignore how other people are living. \n\nSpend less than you make. Even if that means sacrifices like living with roommates. \n\nIt's not fair. It sucks. But ignoring it doesn't change it. No one is coming to save you. People all over the world live in extreme poverty their entire lives, and their parents and grandparents did the same, and their children and grandchildren will also. Do as well as you can, acknowledging that wealth inequality is a huge issue and while many people think there is a way to fix it (politics, etc), right now this is the reality we live in.",
            "GenX here... I'm frightened for you all, but my advice is to keep on how you've all been. Every time I hear \"Gen z is killing xx industry\" or something like that, it makes me smile. Once the boomers are gone, and no one wants to buy their worthless termite infested neglected homes, the banks will need to start making concessions. Changes are already happening with your generations' refusal to work for a pittance(don't EVER let boomers or GenX tell you you're 'entitled' for doing so!), and I've seen many places that traditionally started at min wage actually starting to offer semi-competitive wages.\n\nDon't let up. Don't accept the garbage heap being handed to you.",
            "The biggest problem for Gen Z (and beyond) is housing. Very few new dwellings are being built to just serve _basic_ needs. Real estate developers are building housing and apartments with more and more luxury features, and the prices just keep increasing. \n\nConsider buying land somewhere it is affordable, and put a barebones home (maybe even a modular home) on that land. You\u2019ll pay significantly less than a home built by a major developer (Ryan, KB, Hovnanian), you won\u2019t have an HOA, and you can make your own choices about which finish details matter to you. You can even do some of the work yourself for additional savings. I am in my forties, and work with a couple people in their late 20s and early 30s who are doing exactly this. \n\nThe same is happening with cars. I bought my first car in the late 1990s. At that time, you could still get a Hyundai Accent for under $9,000. It didn\u2019t have A/C, and it didn\u2019t have power windows, but it was reliable and had a warranty. Small cars and base-model cars are essentially non-existent today.",
            "They aren't expected to.  There was no plan outside of \"screw you I've got mine\", plus people have been suckered into believing that \"all politicians are the same\" so they don't even vote to change anything.",
            "The best advice I can give to a young adult is that the world views constantly shoved down your throat are often not as dire as they are presented.  \n\nFocus on building professional skills around general skills you enjoy now.(computers, socializing, etc).  There's a plethora of resources on the internet that will teach you or at least give you direction.\n\nDo not let employers act like they are doing you a favor.  It's fine to be polite, but read labor laws around things like PTO, overtime, etc.  Keep looking for your next job if the current job is a dead end.  \n\nYou are going to feel like you've been pushed into a corner and it's never going to get better, but it will.  You've got to learn when to leave a bad situation.",

You're a rational being, capable of achieving whatever you set your mind toward. Find your values, and fight to keep them. Find kind people, and organize your life around them. Work hard every day, keep your house clean, and cook from scratch as much as you can. Turn the music up! Enjoy art. Walk through nature, enjoy sunsets and sunrises.\n\nThe human condition has not changed. Generations of people have been going through things much worse than we for centuries and centuries, and the world keeps spinning. The beat goes on: ladedadedee, ladedadeda.",

At 18, 19 or 23, there was no way I could have afforded a new car, a $1500 cell phone, a 1 bedroom fancy apartment, eating out, new furniture, new clothes. Everything came from thrift stores except the phone and it was a nice unlocked that I used a pay as you go service. I learned how to cook before I ever left home and Dad taught me how to change my own oil and replace light bulbs and the battery on my paid-in-cash- used car.\n\nMom taught me how to handle money. I always have an emergency fund because I can delay purchases. I see a cute pair of shoes and I wait 24 hrs. If I still gotta have them, then I go buy them.

Millennials have been feeling like this since around 2007 and are just as stuck as Gen Z, except some younger Millennials were actually warned on time by their history teachers after the recessions. It didn't facilitate things though and I think their having been td their future struggles didn't help them cope with it if anything it killed the little optimism and hope they had left, keeping them in perpetual depression. Gen Z seems a bit cheery due to having Gen X parents, who sort of just gave up on the rat race in HS and have sort of not given a fuck plus a lot of Gen X women married Boomer men so that lot have been sort of fringing between having some of the nice things Boomers experienced if they married Boomers, which again was common in the women. Millennials especially elder Millennials feel almost anxious and angry while younger Millennials feel almost dead on the inside regarding their quality of life as it's always been crap: Restrained in childhood and youthhood and now restrained while nearing middle age.

Have someone make you a Gimlet or even a Singapore Sling.\n* The art of the Highball.  I can't stand whiskey, for example, even something as mild as Canadian Club.  Drinking it straight is really rough and unpleasant.  But drop a shot or two in a glass of ginger ale, and suddenly it's very pleasant to sip over ice.\n* If you don't like wine, as I often don't, try dessert wines like Lambrusco or others (I see Moscato mentioned below, too).

If you want a little relaxing buzz at night try out some super low dose thc/cbd blend edibles or something along those lines if you must.

            "I don't like alcohol very much, very rarely drink it maybe 5 drinks a year or so. I found that top shelf booze is actually worth tasting once in a while since aging really mellows out the harsh flavor and there's no burn, even hard liquors. Also the barrels add all kinds of interesting notes. By top shelf I'm talking $150+ per bottle and 20 years old or so. Other than that, regular booze like Smirnoff or whatever is barely better than rubbing alcohol.",

My flatmates and I usually went out to this one bar and ordered rounds of vodka and coke (within covid restrictions), but I quickly grew to despise it. Once when I tried ordering a much fruiter cocktail, I feel like they gave some funny looks. It was too obvious I wasn't used to the harder stuff.\n\nAt someone's flat party someone handed me a lager for the first time. Maybe it was the specific brand but holy shit that was awful. Still finished it since it was free.\n\nI'm fine with not liking most alcohol, or being a lightweight. I just wish I had the ability to stomach more kinds just to get through social situations.

I mean, sure, I have the palate of a six year old, but I just couldn't find one that worked for me that I could genuinely enjoy. \n\nFortunately, you don't have to drink, thankfully, lol. That said, you can experiment with different kinds of drinks and see if there's a particular beer, perhaps, that grabs you, or something like a mixed drink. Change it up and see what's out there.

It doesn't matter what I mix it with, and it takes a lot to mix to make it tolerable. I have tried various drinks for about 20 years with little luck.\n\nThere is ONE exception and that is the beautiful world of hard apple cider, and yes it has to be apple. I love the stuff, if you get the good ones you bypass or subdue that alcohol flavor altogether. Cheaper ones made from concentrate or with additives still have it. I couldn't believe it when I started drinking it. I went on a quest to be sure it was cider and find out which ones were the best. I never could have believed it with any other alcohol but I feel like a somalier with cider. I can taste fully different flavor profiles, even a difference in apple varieties and aging techniques.\n\nI'm not saying it'll work for you but maybe give it a try? There is nothing wrong with not drinking either, but I always wondered what the appeal was and why it didn't work for me. I don't drink much but I can happily avoid all the questions if I'm in a social setting by ordering a cider.",
