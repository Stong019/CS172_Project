Maybe it's a small group of individuals but I've read so many posts here of kids being kicked out and all were from the U.S. Can someone explain the thought process that goes in the mind of someone who thinks it's a good idea to kick a literal kid with no serious work experience, education or means of providing for themselves, out of their home? \n\nI hope this doesn't classify as \"sealioning\", I am legitimately interested in finding an explanation and hold no ill will against the parents who do this.\n\n\nEdit: 950 comments so far woah, that's awesome!

            "I'm 30 now so it's been a while, but at least when I was a kid it was just a holdover from a time when it was more doable. I come from a blue collar family that never had a college graduate before my generation so nobody ever had debt to worry about, we lived in the rural Midwest where decent-to-high paying jobs in manufacturing and construction were easy to come by, housing in general was cheap, it was all in all just much easier to do when my parents were that age and even easier for my grandparents (all of whom also got married at that age).\n\nThe difference with me is that my little farming town absolutely fuckin *boomed* in population when I was growing up, and it coincided perfectly with the manufacturing jobs getting shipped out of town *and* the financial crash happening right as I graduated high school. I grew up expecting to leave when I was 18 but luckily my mom saw the writing on the wall and knew it wouldn't be possible by the time I was that age, so she let me stay as long as I was working. \n\nA lot of people in my area specifically (formerly rural, now suburban Midwest) weren't so lucky, and had way less flexible parents who basically told them to suck it up because it was easy for them so logically it'll be easy for you too. \n\nSo I can't speak for America as a whole, but while it's really not nearly as common as it used to be, when it happens in mostly white areas that used to be pretty small, it's because it used to be easy thirty years ago and some people simply aren't willing to recognize how different the world is and just shove their kids off to \"be an adult\" before they have any reasonable chance of being self sufficient.",
            "My ex boyfriend's take on this was that he would have paid for them to live at his house up to 16 (get a job at 16 and pay rent) then kick them out as soon as they graduate. He said because at 18 they are an adult and all adults should take care of themselves. Now he had crippling back pain and wouldn't get out of bed for days, expecting others to wait on him. Its a back-asswards thing that people do...",

            "My grandmother kicked me out when I was 19. I was working at taco bell for. 7.25 an hour. Gave me 3 months to save up and move out. Kinda impossible making that little. Plus I had to pay for school out of pocket. Slept outside for 2 days. Called crying asking to come back. She said nah, it's time you learn how to be a man. And I never went back. Maybe cause I didn't talk to her lot or interact socially,  But I still think it was fucked up. Roadmap for failure in the future.",
            "It also depends on what the kid is doing. My cousin's son dropped out of college at 19 to come home and play WOW in the basement 24/7. Refused to get a job, go back to school, volunteer. After a few months we did an intervention. Said he was free to play video games all day and night, just not at my cousin's house. Could go on social assistance, get an apt with friends, whatever, just not stay where he was. Gave him a three month deadline, by which time he had started going to the gym and had found a college diploma course he liked and headed back to school. He graduated and is doing great now, has his own apt in another city and a nice girlfriend.",
            "This only happens in families that already have other underlying issues. If you and your parents get along there is a pretty high likelyhood you are sticking around for a while. If you don't want to get a job, dropped out of high school, and don't help out around the house then maybe yeah they will look at giving you a kick in the pants.\n\nA recent study found that 52% of people age 18-29 still live with their parents. This is the highest since the great depression. High cost of rent and student loans are a main contributing factor\n\nEdit: looking at the study they used 18-29 for their range not 35. Many other studies generally group it 18-35 which is where I mixed it up.",
            "I have to think that the parents that do this truly never wanted kids to begin with, or didn\u2019t realize it until it was too late and this is their easy out of having the burden of responsibility. Just my opinion, I have nothing to base this off of. They\u2019re assholes.",

            "In our circumstance, we said to our 18 year old son, \"You can't have your girlfriend over to our house while we're at work and have loud sex with her while your little sister is home. Give your sister some money and send her to the park for an hour, take her to her grandparents' house, SOMETHING. This is not okay.\"\n\n\"Junior, we told you not to do this. Your girlfriend's moaning and wailing is embarrassing and upsetting. Stop it. This is our house, these are our rules: no loud sex while your sister's home. Go to your girlfriend's house. Get a hotel room.\"\n\n\"Junior, if you do this one more time, we're going to kick you out, we're serious. This is not your house, you pay no rent. We decide what goes on in our house, and this loud moaning and sex talk cannot go on while your little sister's home. If you disrespect us and your sister again, you're out. Do you understand?\"\n\nHe left us no choice. \n\nWell, she did, really. All she had to do was be quiet, for Christ's sake.",
            "I lived at home until 27, once I had a full time job my parents only asked that I help around the house and call them if I'm gonna be out late.\n\nStaying at home helped me save the money to purchase a house with my now wife.",
            "My dad tried to do this to me.  I had been working 30 hours a week during the school year, 50 during the summer milking cows since I was 15.  Buying food for the family, so I would have something to eat when I got home.  I told him no, and I am pretty sure that my mom chewed his ass, as he stopped saying anything to me after that.\n\nAfter 3 semesters of community college I transferred to a state school 150 miles away.  I was super happy when my grandparents basically made up the excuse that \"we are moving and don't want the new house to be empty, so you should move in for the summers\".  Only spent one night in the house by myself.  Thanks Grandma!\n\nNow I do foster care and I tell her all our kids that they are welcome to stay until they are 30.  Not sure who will take us up on the offer, as it's only been a few years, but the offer is very real.",
            "A bit of context you're missing is that in America, it is/was *expected* that you move out when you're 18.\n\nThis is a bit of an artifact from a couple decades ago. But the idea was, nobody *wanted* to stay at home after 18. You turned 18, you were done with school, you could get a job and your own place, have some freedom, live your life.\n\nCompare and contrast to some cultures where you're expected to live with your parents until you get married. That idea is *stifling* to many Americans.\n\nNow, all that is different than being **kicked out** at 18. But that's the context. Now take a family that has issues, parents who are struggling or abusive in some way, they'll go \"you're 18, this is America. Get out!\"",
            "Shitty parents throw their kids out at 18, because that's the earliest they can legally do it. This isn't really seen as acceptable. There is a cultural expectation for adult children to move out and be fully independent as soon as they can, though, but that's not the day they turn 18.",
            "Just to balance the scales a bit. I know people here in utopian Denmark who got kicked out when they were 18. Social safety net being better than most places, it is less harsh. But still.",
            "My kid is a preteen. He can stay with us as long as he wants provided he is doing something productive with his life and working toward self-sufficiency. I only care about that really because it is good to have professional and personal goals and I want him to be able to take care of himself after I die. I would never make him move out because he is a certain age.",
            "My dad started threatening to kick me out as soon as I hit puberty. His limit was my refusal to adopt his racism and involving myself romantically with people he only referred to in derogatory terms. I had a week to pack my shit and find a place because he had already bought a new house. I was immediately disowned and battled homelessness and unemployment for the next two years. It\u2019s been three years since we\u2019ve spoken, he still has sentimental items of mine, and he never told me his new address though it wasn\u2019t hard to find. \n\nI feel this only happens in families where the relationship is already damaged and the parent(s) are usually raging narcissists. Although I\u2019m going off of anecdotal evidence.",
            "Maybe with White Americans but it's not the case with Asian, Hispanic, and Arab Americans who let their kids stay at home until they're ready to move out. The kids usually end up looking after their parents when they get old too instead of dumping them in a retirement home. Those cultures are just more family orientated compared to western cultures which are more about being independent.",
            "Here in Pakistan and most asian countries it is sort of a tradition that you live with your parents till marriage untill and unless you are studying in a university and live in the uni housing or you have graduated from uni and have a nice paying job even then parenta dont kick out their children. Children usually move out when they think it is right for them.\nAlso for us it is absurd that parents dont support you. Actually I dont know ANY single person that had to pay for their education out of pocket. Parents here 99.9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999% of the time pay for for all education including university/masters/ and basically any education untill and unless you have a high paying and nice job.",
            "Both of my kids are 25, and both of them have, over the last 7 years, moved out and come back twice.  I've always told them that no matter what, my home is a soft-landing space for them if they need it, and thankfully they've come back here rather than try to tough it out unnecessarily. \n\nBut here's the thing -- they both have tried to rush through getting their shit back together to move back out as soon as they can, and it's not me that's rushing them out the door -- it's them. They have been fed this social construct that they should feel ashamed for living at home, that they should be off trying to make something of themselves, and if they're still living with their mom, they've got a tick in the failure box.  My daughter and granddaughter live with me now, again, and I've done my best not to put pressure on her to stay, but gradually, over the past 6 months she's starting to let go of that bullshit and beginning to make decisions based on what she needs, and not what society, or other family members think.\n\nI love my kids, AND I love my alone time, but I'm going to make good and god-damned sure that they don't have to struggle unnecessarily.  I don't believe it builds character, I think it's a low-level trauma that I can help them to avoid.  There's nothing wrong with a struggle that actually gets you somewhere -- but spinning your wheels, jumping from fire to pan to fire to pan -- that takes away time and energy from shit that will actually improve their lives.",
            "I think it has something to do with the social aspect of having adult children living in your home. \n\nYou are see as a failure of a parent if your child can't hold their own by then. \n\nThis same expectation led me to find my own housing so I didn't feel like a failure to meet societies expectations.",
            "When money and jobs were plenty, it was easy for kids just turned 18 to leave and start their own families. This was back when minimum wage was ACTUALLY the minimum wage you could live off of. It's hard to say if it was just easier for them to leave, or if it was trendy/socialized to be on your own. I believe that was around or before the baby boomers. So it was there just long enough to become the social norm or the expected. \n\nI read about other countries where you can stay with your parents until you're 30+ or married. Sometimes even then the newly married couple just starts their own family inside the previous family's home. That's so wild. I stayed with my parents until I was 20 and even then I was filled with shame for not being able to provide for myself like I was expected to.",
            "I have no idea this has got to be a crazy thing. I have a friend from HK and he is confused by this as well. At 18 while you are an adult your not ready to play on an adult level yet. Why not stay at home save your money sure help with food and bills but save your money go to school, learn a trade start a business or buy some restate to use as a business property. As a parent why would you set your child up for failure by telling them they have to get out at 18. Let them stay and make sure they that when they make that step and move out they have a strong foundation and a safety net that is in place.",
            "Come to Sweden. We are probably the most individualistic country on earth. We have kids who move out of their home as low as 15 without people bulging an eye.\n\nIt's a bit harder now, because we are in a housing crisis, but it's still expected for kids to move out asap.",
            "My oldest kid turns 18 next month and I would never dream of making him move out!  He is legit an awesome person, and I will be so sad when he decides to move, whenever that might be.",

            "52% of 19-30 year olds live with their parents. It's a myth.",
            "In the US you are viewed as a failure if you still live with your parents as an adult. \nHere \"They probably still live in their mom's basement\" is a huge insult.\n\nSome of them think that their kid will never succeed if there is no incentive to make it on your own. And according to them hardship builds character.\n\nI'm not defending it and there are plenty of other terrible reasons why a parent would kick out their child. But this is probably why it's not looked down upon.",
            "As an American that was able to live with my grandparents till 23 then was allowed to move back in with my husband when I was pregnant(he just got out of the military) till we could find a place I find it insane. Knowing I have them to lean on might make me less of an adult in some people's eyes but it is a great feeling to have.",
            "My mother kicked me out several times, starting when I was around 7. Eventually, I developed the habit of keeping an emergency suitcase packed. At 16, I had been saving up money from a job for a while and could tell that another blow-up was coming, so I grabbed my emergency suitcase, got a plane ticket from Salt Lake City to Seattle and never went back. It was incredibly terrifying and living homeless, at that age, came with a lot of traumatic bullshit but I think my mother just couldn't handle not getting her way. Any disagreement was perceived as disrespect and I wasn't ever going to be okay with that, so I went my own way. I'd never wish that situation on anyone and it should be illegal to put your kids through that.",
            "It's baggage from the great depression and our parents and grandparents resulting work ethic. Times were brutal back then and it was \"earn your keep or GTFO\" ... I turned 18 in the 90's and mom was always very clear that 18 mean pay rent. To her or to a landlord. \n\nTo some extent it was more realistic in the past. There was a time when a kid with no experience could get a good job laboring in a factory, or in construction, and work their way into a career that could buy a house, feed kids, and pay for college.\n\nThat's not the reality anymore.",
            "Never kicked my kids out, nor did my parents. Have no idea why people would do that.",
            "because there was a time in america where you could work 40 hours a week and own a home, have a family, and a car and provide for yourself. parents tend to be under the impression that america is still that way when it\u2019s certainly not been for some time now.",
            "Confirmation bias. Reddit is very America-centric. I think it's less an issue of American culture and more of shitty parents who think they are only parents for 18 years and then rid of all responsibility.",
            "Historically it was because most of us didn\u2019t need to live at home. We were either away at college or had jobs that allowed us to support ourselves. Either way, it was usually out choice, not so much our parents kicking us out. \n\nHowever, things aren\u2019t as cheap for young adults anymore so more are staying at home longer.",
            "If you hang out around abusive parent subreddits it's going to seem like a common thing that happens a lot and it happens more than it should but in the grand scheme of things it's a small percentage",
            "Well, I\u2019m currently being threatened with getting kicked out. My father\u2019s child support is ending soon, so my mother says she can\u2019t afford our house without the payments (despite the fact her husband and her earn 80k). Therefore, they\u2019re getting a smaller house without room for me. \n\nSo financial reasons could be a reason it\u2019s acceptable in the US, especially for single mothers. However considering they\u2019re keeping my older brother who dropped out of college, it\u2019s likely personal reasons in my case.",

            "My step dad kicked me out of my moms house less than a month after I turned 18 and gave me 6 hours to get out. I had to work that night and couldn\u2019t find anyone to cover me so I could pack my stuff. I hauled out as much as I could in the one trip I had time for, which wasn\u2019t much. I came back after work to get the rest of my stuff and my mom had moved my brother into my bedroom. She refused to give me any more of my stuff. She gave me a yellow folder full of information on therapists, and a dirty blanket. That\u2019s it. I literally had no where to go, and couch surfed for a while before finding someone to take me on as a roommate. I think american parents are just more heartless.",
            "I\u2019d say greed in my case. My parents constantly talked about kicking me out of the house by 18 and then how I\u2019d be responsible for taking care of them in their old age. As soon as I turned 18 my dad started charging me $700 a month to stay with him along with doing every house hold chore for him. American parents seem entitled and act like their children owe them eternal gratitude, respect and money then act confused and hurt when they get cut out of their children\u2019s lives.",
            "It is parents who don't really parent, trying to go through the motions when it comes to raising children.\n\nIn America, at 18, high school is over, and past that it is up to the family (child and parent) to move the child into secondary education or vocation, but it isn't mandatory. In a stable/ well structured household the transition to college (or vocational training or an employment path)  is done with the parents, guiding and helping the child.\n\nIn a house were parenting has failed, the parents try to reach the same outcome by kicking the kid out because they believe its the kids fault they haven't moved into 'the adulthood' of forward education or employment.\n\nIn other words, they think this is what parents are supposed to do, is kick the kid out, because they are 'lazy' or 'losers.' Like somehow they played no role in the maturation of their own child.",

            "In Italy you literally stay with your parents until you can afford to move out and settle down with a partner. It's perfectly normal for someone in their late 20s and even 30s to live with their parents, and it works because there is a mutual respect there.\n\nI see so often in the UK as well as the States, kids growing up to hate their parents and parents hating their kids. Then the kid wants to move out at 18 or 21 and moans because they can't afford to buy some apartment. Why on earth should you be able to buy an apartment at that age? It's just crazy to me.",
            "I was dying to get out of my parents' house, but I was already paying for a full college load out of my earnings and there was just not enough left.

            "Because when this generations parents where 18 the economy was going well enough that you easily could just move out at 18. College (plus dorm and all that) could be payed with a part time job and getting a degree almost guaranteed a well paying job. Once women entered the work force, the price of labor effectively halved(not blaming women here). Now low skilled workers and virtually worthless to employers and a college degree has become another unhelpful hurdle. To start your kid off well these days requires at least 20 years. Often longer. \n\nCombine that bad precedent with the fact the children are interacting less and less with their parents every year, and it gets worse. \n\nAny more parents don\u2019t tend to know how to form a relationship with their kids. Mostly because they never see them. Everyone is working all the time. So why does that matter? At about 16-18 the relationship between a child and parent must change dramatically. The kid has to become an adult and take their life into their own hands. Which means the parents have to let go of control, which is really hard to do when your relationship hasn\u2019t built up to be much more than one based on parental control and (hopefully) guidance. If there\u2019s no genuine human connection, the child\u2019s growth equates to the loss of your child. It may seem strange, but many people would rather lose their child than think they\u2019ve lost their child. \n\nSeems something like that to me",

We got into a fight over something ridiculous, and she ended up screaming at me to leave. I packed a backpack, called my friend, and left. She called me trying to get me to come back, but I never did, we ended up repairing our relationship a couple of years later.\n\nIn my case, my mom and I fought a lot and said a lot of hateful stuff to eachother when I was a teenager, and I think she just said something she didn't mean, and didn't expect me to react and figure it out on my own.",

In both our culture and the culture of other friends born to immigrant parents of other ethnicities, it seems it's much more common for kids to stay home than American families.\n\nHeck pretty much every one of my cousins lives at home until they're 1) married or 2) get a job in a completely different city where it would be impractical to commute from the parents. It makes no sense to me that folks should leave home right at 18.\n\nNote: A lot of the folks I'm taking about (especially the ones in the US as opposed to the ones still in the old country) have jobs like engineers, pharmacists, etc so it isn't the money. They're all making $75k+ a year as single adults in an area with a low cost of living. It's all culture.",
            "While still in my senior year of HS, my parents told me that while they highly encouraged me to go to college (neither of them have college degrees, so they wanted me to go), they told me that I was more than welcome to continue living at home.  But that also came with paying 1/3 of the mortgage and 1/3 utilities on top of whatever other personal expenses I would have (I'm an only child, so three people living in the house).  It never came to this as I was accepted into college and started after graduating high school.  But I was very thankful for the option that they presented instead of only pushing me to move out on my own.",
            "There are three primary causes for this:\n\n* The kid is going to college, and once they leave, there's a general expectation that they'll be on their own. They might come back summers during school, but this transition sort of marks the end of their residence in their parents' home. They aren't strictly kicked out, but returning would be bad form. \n\n* The parents see the kid as a burden/expense, and now it is time for them to support themselves. This is particularly true in contentious households, but it can be the case in a lot of different situations. \n\n* The parents (earnestly) believe that it is proper for kids to get out on their own once they become of age, and feel that it might be necessary to \"kick the chick out of the nest\" so to speak. I've found that this is often intended to avoid the worst-case scenario of the under-developed thirty year-old who never made it out of their parents' basement. \n\nIn all these cases, there is a sense, usually shared by parent and child, that the kid \"isn't supposed to be living at home\". There is a serious social stigma attached to it, one of such magnitude that some people won't even try to date or even have a real social life while they are still living with their parents. I think both parents and children feel the weight of that stigma, which contributes to the habit of kicking kids out when they come of age.",
            "I know at least for me it was the pervasive rugged individualism mentality that got me. My parents gave me three options when I became a teenager (because play time was over):\n\n\"By 18 you must\" \n\n1. Join the service\n2. Go to college\n3. Get the fuck out.\n\nRegardless of whether they wanted me to stay or go, I wanted to go. I thought it was weak for someone who was legally considered an adult to still live with their parents and I'd be damned if it was gonna be me.\n\nSo I got all my shit together and graduated HS early and had my own place a couple months before I turned 18. I was proud of the fact. Lol. I suffered but on the up I was able to survive and being desperately poor and homeless taught me a lot of empathy ultimately. Worth it cause I was deep in the rabbit hole.\n\nI'm giving my kid different options at 18 and have already instilled the value of others and community in him to a point I can't reach and am envious of.

It's a big problem in america.\n\nMy dad brags about how he moved out when he was 18 but will leave out the part where he lived in an apartment that was part of an entire complex his dad owned. My mom will brag about how she moved out when she was young but will leave out the part where she only managed to leave because she married some nobody. She also cleaned out my savings from allowance when I was a kid which certainly didn't help for my future.\n\nMy parents expected me to do the same but forgot to raise me into a functioning adult so I struggled for a long time, mentally.",

            "My dad was a strict parent with 20 years in the military. He was preaching I was out as soon as I graduated and I was nowhere near prepared. Ended up moving in with my older brother. My family had a lot of dysfunction growing up. Although I was nowhere near prepared at the time, I would rather struggle than deal with the stresses of home life. Some times I feel like I missed out on the advantage of living with mom and dad and saving money for the future but looking back, I'm glad it happened",
            "My dad wanted me to go into the military right out of high school and I decidedly told him no. So he kicked me out of the house even though I had a job and was in college.

He got exactly what he wanted and saw he was miserable for it. Then decided maybe he should at least try to be not a selfish  asshole some of the time. \n\nHe had and has ongoing unresolved mental health issues of a severe nature. \n\nI know a few other people who have gone through similar circumstance. \n\nIn America a lot of people are barely surviving financially. Work doesn't pay enough across a wide range of the working class spectrum. This combined with lack of financial and geographical access to mental health services and the high cost of living in general means that a lot of Americans never get any help of any kind because the government doesn't provide anything to most people and also because working class individuals can't afford to buy many services in the private Healthcare sector.",

I moved back in with my parents a couple of times after, when I lost jobs and couldn't afford to support myself; my parents never looked askance at it, even though I was only there for a while. I had friends who stayed with their parents well into their 20's and early 30's and no one thought it was weird at all. \n\nOver here I've met so many people who have no qualms with the idea of kicking their kids out when they're 18, whether they're ready or not. It's sad how many stories there are on r/homeless and r/almosthomeless of kids who suddenly became homeless because they were turned out on, or not long after, their 18th birthday. When I cautiously bring up the idea with people I know, who have kids, whether it's a better to wait until their children *are ready to move out*, they think such kids are \"deadbeats\" and their parents enabling \"laziness\". It's bonkers.",
            "Rugged Individualism is the mentality that America has cultivated over the years. It is better for the economy for people to leave their homes and participate in the economy ( Work, Rent, Schooling, Buying things )\n\nDepending on the person who lives at home they can either be employed or unemployed. Living at home lowers costs for the person who lives at home so they use that opportunity to either have more free time ( Education/Childcare/Taking care of elderly ) or not work ( Not very common ). The other set of people who are employed and work at home tend to put money into savings, which is not good for the economy or business.\n\nThe \"Lazy\" stereotype of people who live with their parents was popularized but American movie and TV culture and was accelerated by the anti-drug movements of the 80s and beyond.\n\nThe real logic behind America is the consumer economy and the funneling of wealth to a few institutions. Payed lawmaking made it easier to do that. Incorporated media helped advertise that. The dissolving of culture helps to propagate that.\n\nMany people think that \"Other people\" are causing many of the US problems we have now but really it's more of small laws favoring one business or individual that all work together in an evolved system. The Starbucks Red Cup was good for business, Overplaying christmas music was good for business, Selling little flags made in china was good for business, Destroying morals is good for business, making 7 people all live on their own and pay for each individual rent/food/entertainment is better for business than having those 7 people live in one house and share resources.\n\nReally living with your parents as you get older is just bad for business.\n\nThe reason people are living with their parents nowadays is just extremely low pay (Below the cost of living) in most jobs and the fact that living together is cheaper than living apart.",
            "okay time for a real answer for you. \n\nThis actually wasn't the norm in America, but the draft in Vietnam changed all that. When kids were drafted to war at 18, they were basically asked to grow up. Men rushed to marry and make children etc. For those who came home after the war, they began instilling on their children they were, \"grown\" at 18. In their minds - they fought a war at 18 so good riddance to the kids. It is slowly getting back to the norm of people staying with their parents past that age. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBasically its a historical thing.",

Another girl she knows came into our home fresh from rehab and had an abortion and squirted milk into my then 14 year olds face. The actions of my oldest put my youngest at risk and my home and possessions at risk. 17 year old is getting lots of counseling but the counselor tells me she has \u201clow motivation\u201d to change. 17 year old tells me when she\u2019s 18 she will legally be a resident in my home and will bring here whomever she pleases. I will likely have to legally evict her. She\u2019s very into her \u201crights\u201d and doesn\u2019t respect the rules of the home, which are all safety rules.

My parents kicked me out the day after graduation because I didn\u2019t do enough. I took the day before graduation, the day of and after off. The day after graduation was meant to be my one day off without doing anything for anyone. But dad wanted me to clean the camper for the up coming holiday weekend. I was so pissed and tired of being used. I started cleaning it but I didn\u2019t finish. I was 18 at the time. At 17 I finished my last three high school classes through a community college. Which meant I didn\u2019t go to high school my senior year. And I finished my classes in December while waiting for may to come around to graduate. After all the success I had. It wasn\u2019t enough. And my parents wanted more. That\u2019s when I picked up three jobs. It was more to get away from my parents. But of course it didn\u2019t help. I was desperate to leave. But I didn\u2019t have my diploma. But that day I didn\u2019t finish cleaning. He said I had an hour to pack my stuff and leave. Mom wanted me to try to talk to him and beg to stay. But I was done. I had what I needed and No one was going to stop me. When I tried to leave dad said I could stay but things won\u2019t be the same. Of course it won\u2019t. I walked out and put everything in the car. Of course he said he will be taking the car back and he was turning off my service. But when I was leaving the drive way I finally got a hold of my boyfriend. And a month later we got a house. It\u2019s been over a year and my dad says it was my choice to leave and he didn\u2019t kick me out. But i know the truth. I feel like I may have lost the opportunity at something big. I found out I have a passion for cooking and am trying to pursue it. The hard truth is that I was adopted and my brother was true blood. They spoiled him. And after a good enough childhood I had, they started taking advantage of me. It\u2019s disturbing the things they do for my brother versus what they let me do growing up. It\u2019s textbook definition of favoritism. But now they have their dream family. They get to put all their love and attention on their son. While wondering how their adopted daughters are doing.

Men are King.\n\nBy the time you grow up and become a legal adult you are so estranged from the idea of family and what thats supposed to mean, you have spent so little time together as a family, you gladly part ways and go ''off to school\" (again), this time full time and or the military (full time).\n\nThere is no family except in name, we are divided against each other intentionally, early on, by law.",

            "Some things that Andrew Tate says in soundbites makes sense; but he\u2019s not the only one saying those things nor was he the person who invented those philosophies. For example he has (controversial) viewpoints on depression that it \u2018doesn\u2019t exist\u2019 and is situational. Some people agree with him on this and he has a point that sometimes you need to change aspects of your life instead of going straight to medication. However there are plenty of influencers who say the same. You can go to any unqualified life coach and they will tell you the same thing, and probably in a nicer way too.\n\nWhat makes Andrew Tate problematic is his attitude towards women and his taking advantage of teenage boys with his ideology. Unfortunately you cannot really separate Andrew Tate\u2019s opinions on making money and general life from his view on women or his problematic actions.\n\nA lot of the money he has made is specifically from  exploiting women. He brags about how he basically ran a human trafficking ring by having women who were in love with him sleep with men for money (for him). He views women as \u2018property\u2019, of their male significant other, and that any \u2018profit\u2019 from their body is also the man\u2019s property. He often refers to them as \u2018bitches\u2019 as well. He moved to Romania specifically because the laws surrounding human trafficking and SA are looser there. \n\nWhen grown men support him, teenage boys see that. And they rightfully have trouble separating his views on women with his views on anything else because they are interconnected. Now we have an entire generation of young men who are watching this guy be excused or even praised by their adult counterparts. I can\u2019t stress enough how bad this is for women\u2019s future in this country. We just got our abortion rights sacked, and it seems like the general culture in the US is becoming more derogatory towards women thanks to influencers like this. \n\nPlus he runs a pyramid scheme under the guise of hustlers university and targets adolescent men with it promising they will have access to exclusive information to help them make money. It is very typical of pyramid schemes to target children. Supporting Andrew Tate is basically supporting the equivalent of monat, it works, cutco, and many other MLM\u2019s. \n\nA grown adult should have the critical thinking skills to be able to understand why supporting Andrew Tate is problematic. Either this guy you\u2019re talking to is easily manipulated or he is purposefully ignorant. Drop him either way and tell him to read a book lmao.",

            "TL;DR: doesn't matter how big or red the flag is; you should move on. \n\nIt looks like you've got your answer \u2013 over and over and over. \n\nPersonally, I still can't really tell if he drinks all his own Kool-Aid, or if he's a WWE-style heel, like some here have suggested, taking advantage of naive young men's insecurities to make a quick and sizeable buck. For all we know, he's the one behind all the \"bad\" Andrew rumors, etc. because he knows that garners even more attention (i.e. moolah) from even more disturbed young men. None of that matters, however, because you're not talking about dating *him*; you're talking about dating someone who *idolizes* him, and that *is* a legitimate concern. \n\nInsecure young men are aplenty in this world \u2013 I was one myself \u2013 and they all arrive at that place for all sorts of reasons. Sometimes it's just because of an uninvolved, but otherwise harmless father; sometimes it's something much more traumatic. Sometimes it just makes them shy and withdrawn; sometimes it festers into addiction, rage, violence. Sometimes a little time, maturity, maybe a dash of therapy is all it takes for them to overcome whatever keeps them there; sometimes nothing can set them free. \n\nThe Andrew Tate \"character\" (FWIW)  doesn't seem to encourage a loving exploration of root causes and discovery of positive solutions, or engender acceptance of emotional scars, accountability for behavior stemming from them, and a clear-eyed, conscientious commitment to growing up and out of the darkness. Instead, he instructs other men to more openly express their anger \u2013 a totally different thing than expressions of hurt \u2013 and to compensate for their lack of self-esteem through more aggression, more chauvinism, more entitlement. \n\nYour guy might come to his senses and realize all this one day. It probably won't happen until *after* he has done some relatively major damage to himself, to his life, or (unfortunately most likely) to someone who loves him. Or it might never happen at all. Either way, you don't need to stick around for the journey. \n\n\"Kinda dating\" is a good place to stop. And if you feel an urge to stick with him despite the obvious peril \u2013 doesn't sound like it, but just in case you do \u2013 then I urge you to talk to someone and do a little exploration of your own, to find what drives that need inside you.",

So it  makes the dishwasher's life a little easier if they don't have to scrape off every plate and they are already stacked. I can tip the waiter but most dishwashers don't get tips.\n\nI worked in the kitchen, so my sympathy is mostly for the back of the operation.",

Let me know if I'm screwing up.\n\nThe way we do it is bigger plates at the bottom to smallest at the top. All scraps/trash on the top dish. Glasses not stacked so they don't stick.

            "There are three things that must be true for voting:\n\n1. It must be accurate- each voter must be able to vote exactly once and their vote must be correctly recorded\n2. It must be anonymous- no one must be able to tell who voted for which candidate, so you can't be pressured to vote a particular way.\n3. It must be verifiable- all sides involved must be able to verify that the first two things are true. You shouldn't need to trust anyone\n\nThe problem with online voting is number 3. There's no way to make sure that your vote is accurately recorded without being able to trace your individual vote. With traditional voting, there are observers seeing with their own eyes that things are being done correctly. But you can't observe an online vote. Even if I show you a computer program that counts votes correctly, there's no way for me to prove that the computer program running on the server is the same program I showed you, or that there isn't some other program off to the side messing with the data. \n\nThe reason online banking works is because it doesn't care about being anonymous- every transaction you make is tied to your identity. You can see every transaction made in your name and verify them after the fact, even on the phone or in a brink and mortar bank if you don't trust the computer and you can contest any discrepancies. But that can't be allowed in voting.\n\nEDIT: for those of you jumping at the bit to reply \"But Blockchain solves this\", please look at the replies to the other fifty people who have already brought that up.",

            "Online banking is safe enough for banking, but bank will still sell you a *online fraud insurance*  (and not only as a trick to make you pay more) and bank transfer being delayed/lost/duplicated happen every so and on (Sometimes it's not even a problem with the software bun an issue between the chair and the keyboard) . \n\nThe problem is that bank transactions are semi-public, you can check where did your money went, and where does your money come from.  To take a typical example, let's say you messed up when paying your rent and the transaction wasn't properly finished while you thought it did. A couple of day latter you'll get a call from your landlord *hey I haven't seen the rent coming, you'll reply something but I thought I paid let me check*. Then you see that the money hasn't left your account and that there is no trace of the transfer order so you pay your rent and done. \n\nThe problem with voting is that your vote is anonymous, so you have no way to check wether your vote was taken into account.",

            "With banking you have records of every detail of every transaction, so they can be verified and checked for fraud and errors.\n\n\nBut votes are supposed to be secret. In order for electronic votes to remain secret you can't keep records of who voted for what, which means you have no way to check for fraud or errors.",
            "Another less talked about issue is that unfortunately still not everyone has universal access to the internet or a computer. It could also heavily disenfranchise the technological illiterate, such as old people and/or low-income populations.",
            "I think you're forgetting how often shit gets hacked and data gets breached.",

            "finance fraud happens all the time. that\u2019s why chargebacks exist.",
            "The issue is that there's a kind of incompatibility between ID verification and confidentiality. What I mean is, in most online transactions that require an ID, you want the bank or merchant or whatever to be able to link a transaction to an individual. That protects against identity theft and fraud.  \n\n\nHowever, you don't want that for online voting. If I verify my ID to enter a vote, then the election organizers could know exactly who I vote for and can attach my name to a ballot. That would not be good for democracy, since the government should never know who a person voted for exactly, or else they could take advantage of that. We'd just have to trust them to not record this information after verifying the ID.  \n\n\nCompare this to in-person voting. There's a physical disconnect between when you check in and when you vote, so there's no way to link a ballot with any specific individual (outside of really tedious forensics or something). In an online setting, that sort of disconnect is not guaranteed. If they wanted to associate a vote with an individual, there's really nothing stopping them. So, really it's \"not safe\" because it's hard to make sure the organizers can't \"peek\" at ballots.",
            "To be clear - they don't. It's an American thing. There are [many countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_voting_by_country) that have in some way invested the money and time into secure online voting. Estonia is particularly interesting, because they were/are worried about Russia steamrolling them, much like they did the Crimea.\n\nEstonia's answer is by far the most (technically) interesting, given how they certify votes, and use public key infrastructure to ensure that an individual voted, and that their vote was not tampered with. The solutions to this have been around A LONG TIME. The political will, hasn't.",
            "Because you need to make something that your grandmother can use. \n\nAlso because there\u2019s nothing to audit. Once you electronically vote on your phone, it will send a message to the server, and that\u2019s it. You can\u2019t do recounts to check the results are correct. Electronic voting using a government-supplied electronic voting machine is different as they can have internal backups.\n\nI\u2019d point out that this isn\u2019t something America is unusual in.

Not that offline stuff is not traceable, but it's far harder to especially in a large scale. And that's why money laundering and a lot of illegal transactions are usually in cash. \n\nThere's Bitcoin and other technology, but I don't think it can be applied safely into the same conditions and premise as online voting, or at least not proven to be beyond doubt yet.\n\nAnd also a matter of trust.

            "Warning: Am 14 so might be wrong. Voting is comprised of 2 key elements that cannot be negated: anonymity and trust. You need to trust that your votes are being counted right and be completely hidden from your vote. It should not be possible to find out that you voted for xyz candidate and you should have faith that your vote is counted and the results are not skewered. It should also be possible for you to know that your vote counts. Real voting sounds and is secure because if you have every political party\u2019s representative in a room watching the guy count the ballots, you can\u2019t go wrong. With online that just doesn\u2019t exist. With electronic voting at home or at a booth, you can\u2019t be sure that the machine you\u2019re using is safe. This creates distrust.

No: US 2020/0258338\n\nPub. Date: **Aug.13, 2020**\n\nApplicant: **United States Postal Service,** Washington, DC (US)\n\nAppl. No.: 16/785,354\n\nFiled: Feb. 7, 2020\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ABSTRACT**\n\nA voting system can use the **security of blockchain and the mail** to provide a reliable voting system. A registered voter receives a computer-readable code in the mail and confirms identity and confirms correct ballot information in an election. The system separates voter identification and votes to **ensure vote anonymity**, and stores votes on a distributed ledger in a blockchain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Use Mobile Device to Cast Digital Vote**\n\n**\\[0045\\]**  \nIn some embodiments, the voter can receive the paper ballot and use a mobile device or other computer to scan the ballot with a camera. **The voter can then use the mobile device to cast digital votes, which are then written to a blockchain.** The voter can then mail the blank ballot back to the registrar. In some embodiments, the voter does not vote electronically, but instead fills out the paper ballot and sends it to the registrar. In some embodiments, the QR code, barcode, or other computer or machine readable identifier on the printed out ballot can be used to verify the that the ballot was properly submitted by a registered voter. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\\[0072\\]***\n\nIn some embodiments, one software object is a voter 201 (\"VSO 201\"). VSO 201 is a software object representing any individual who is a US citizen **over the age of 18** and **meets the state's residency** requirements and/or **other voting requirements**. In some embodiments, a specific VSO 201 stores data about a specific voter. For example, the VSO 201 can store a voter digital id, a voter **name**, a voter **jurisdiction**, a voter permanent **mailing address**, voter **current address**, voter verification number, and other voter details.\n\n**\\[0076\\]** In some embodiments, voting software system 200 can receive input from an actual voter and can then \"cast\" or create ballot software object 205 (BSO 205), which is a specific instance of BTSO 203. BSO 205 is completed ballot template 203 and is associated with the VSO 201 of the voter that provided the input that was used to fill out BSO 205. In some embodiments, **BSO 205** contains a collection of vote software objects 206, which **represent the actual votes cast by the voter** that corresponds to a specific VSO 201.\n\n**\\[0077\\]** In some embodiments, the voting software system 200 can use notary software object 207 (NSO 207) to **certify that BSO 205 was correctly cas**t. In some embodiments, the NSO 207 certifies that BSO 205 was correctly cast by verifying a hash provided with the BSO 205 with its own computation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**<CERTIFYING FINAL RESULTS>\\[0078\\]** In some embodiments, the NSO 207 will also certify results software object 208 (RSO 208), which is an aggregate of all of the casted votes and represents the result of the election. In some embodiments, the **NSO 207 similarly certifies RSO 208 by verifying a hash provided with the RSO 208** with its own computation. RSO 208 is calculated by the voting software system 200 using the accumulator software object 209 (ASO 209). ASO 209 appropriately buckets each vote received to the receiving candidate. ASO ensures each vote that is recorded is counted properly and can summarize the votes received by various categories.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:\n\n**Re: Anonymity**\n\n**\\[0044\\]**\"Voters can then apply to the system to allow them to receive a mailed ballot. The system can verify the identity of the voter and create a **pseudo-anonymous** token in the form of a unique identifier that represents the voter.  \"\n\n**\\[0057\\]**\"This enables the submission of a physical ballot by mail in an **anonymous** manner and the simultaneous creation of a digitized version using blockchain technology for added security. \"\n\n**\\[0059\\]** In some embodiments, the tokenizer vault 133 can also issue **pseudo-anonymous** obfuscation tokens to voters. In some embodiments, in order to cast a vote in the digital system, the voter must be assigned an obfuscation token corresponding to the election by the tokenizer vault 133. In some embodiments, the obfuscation token is issued using an acceptable algorithm to represent an **anonymized ID of the voter** that is securely stored by a Key Management Service/Key Vault. All user transactions are subsequently **anonymized** and recorded on the blockchain using the token. The obfuscation token can be a type of a **Zero-Knowledge Proof identifier.**\n\n[http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PG01&p=1&u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=20200258338.PGNR.&OS=&RS=](http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PG01&p=1&u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=20200258338.PGNR.&OS=&RS=)",

At all. In case of online banking, you don't trust that fraud will not happen, you trust that fraud will be easily detected - since you'll spot it in your account statement - and then you trust that the bank will refund the fraud transactions if you followed their safety guidelines but they still failed to protect you.\n\nThere's no easy way (or sometimes no way at all) to detected frauded votes on an electronic voting machine, let alone in online voting. There are numerous documented issues with voting machines.

            "Estonia does it, albeit on a much smaller scale. That doesn't mean they don't have to worry about manipulations from Russia. They actually found out, that digital voting is safer than it's traditional counterpart",
            "Its not that voting online in and of itself couldn't be secure, its that the most secure form will always be voting in person on a paper ballot. Its not modern, but its literally the best way to do it if what you care about is security of the election and being able to verify results should a recount be necessary.",
            "We're all assigned a SSN. I don't see why they can't figure out a system where you use that to login to a secure government site to cast your vote or something",
            "Given that even the FBI has come forward with news of intrusion and intellectual theft of information from their highly secured servers, nothing and nobody online is really safe. If we have news of foreign meddling in the election as is, imagine the fuckery we\u2019d experience with online elections. Somewhere, somehow, someone forgot to account for a specific scenario with how they\u2019d be set up and foreign countries would gobble all over that as fast as you can blink",
            "Because those things you say you do \"safely\" online get compromised thousands  of times every day by people motivated by a lot less than some nations and groups would be motivated to mess with an election.",
            "We also live in a world where daily someone is getting their identity stolen, their bank account drained, and every tax season people fine someone else already filed their taxes for them, took the refund and ran.\n\nSo there is that.",
            "Because then too many people would vote, and believe it or not, they don't want that. Imagine everyone voting on referendums and propositions instead of half the people or less. It could work, don't pay attention to the naysayers in this thread spouting all the shit the government has been saying for 20 years. We could also get rid of this bullshit representative government we have, and let the people actually vote on issues, instead of some guy who is supposed to vote on issues FOR YOU.",

            "Here's a good video explaining why it's a [bad idea](https://youtu.be/w3_0x6oaDmI)",
            "Bank fraud happens constantly. They kinda decided that it's just cheaper to eat the costs than to fix it, but with voting elections end up being so close you want to keep fraud lower than the banks are willing to do. The concern with voting online isn't with transmission, it's with making sure the person using their secret key is indeed that person.",
            "No one has figured how to make money over it yet.",
            "It IS safe and secure when done right, take brazil system for for example, 20years of operation, multiple public tests, more than 150M votes and the results are out in a few hours.(and there was never even a single fraud).\n\nits hard to explain without putting a giant text here, srry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nbut it is possible if a govt actually tries it",
            "Self interest.\n\nIn banking every person and institution has an interest in the accuracy and security of the information sent. These are all demanded by multi-billion dollar corporations dealing with trillions of dollars in funds, and entire nations. And they have the money to make it so. We little people benefit like fleas on a well cared for dog.\n\nIn voting, the only people that have a true interest in the accuracy and security are the voters. In other words: Us, the fleas. All the big players want to be able to hack the system at some point, whether that is the candidates, political organizations, governments, or corporations that have large political interests, like military contractors, financial companies, oil and gas, or even unions and activist groups. And many of those with an interest in subverting the system also have direct control of it.",
            "You have to realize there is a layer of security that's always going to be vulnerable to hackers.  It's call the human layer.",
            "Because the RNC and DNC are multimillion dollar corporations with a lot riding on the election so they care about your safety and voice then. But id you do some kind of money transfer online and lose your money well then they don't give a shot.",
            "The YouTuber Tom Scott explains this really well in his video[video](https://youtu.be/LkH2r-sNjQs)",
            "Nobody cares about your taxes, your vote matters far more to more powerful people.",
            "How about this let\u2019s just have a voting holiday. Or a three day weekend where voting could happen.",
            "As an election worker, I have a humble view.\n\nThe current system is old and outdated. A dinosaur. There are theories that have been discussed using blockchain technology, but that\u2019s entirely too much information to post here.\n\nThe powers that be, IMO, do NOT want a voting system where it\u2019s easy and quick for citizens to cast a ballot. This would increase turnout dramatically. Hence, it\u2019s a safe bet that the career politician would be eliminated. Senators would be most vulnerable. \n\nAnother issue is trying to legislate a brand new, modern voting system. You could build the most secure, hack-proof server, in an underground vault, behind 6 ft wide steel doors, with armed guards at every possible access point, and people would STILL say fraud was happening. \n\nI still believe getting Election Day off Tuesday should be priority #1 but that\u2019s another topic.",
            "It would be really a target of hacking. I wouldnt trust it considering voting machines can currently be tampered with. I dont see it as being at all safe. Im glad we have paper ballots so some sleazeballs cant change my votes.",
            "It isn\u2019t.",
            "All those things you mentioned--they're not actually secure.\n\nBut, they also won't single handedly place first, second, and third strike nuclear capabilities into someone's hands.\n\nElectronic voting machines are also NOT SECURE which has been shown repeatedly.\n\nAnything that isn't air gapped, physically secured, and verifiable is NOT SECURE. \n\nPhysical ballots are the only truly secure method of voting.\n\nIf you want to know just how vulnerable some of the most \"secure\" networks are, listen to Darknet Diaries...you do not want online voting.",
            "Okay, this is intended as a cautionary negative example only.\n\nThe Australian government tried to conduct the 2016 census \\[mostly\\] online.\n\nContractors who developed the infrastructure grossly underestimated the requirements for such an online system, and that entire system crashed.  Resolution took days, when it was intended to be a 24 hour event.  Consequently, to this day, some question the validity of the data available from that census.",
            "Question: Why is it important for elections to be anonymous? Like couldnt the possibility of fraud be erased if you could ensure your own vote was properly counted after the fact?",
            "None of those other things you mentioned are secure either",
            "Millions of currency are stolen online everyday, there.",
            "It is. The technology is not only there, but tested and proven for decades now. It\u2019s political, to facilitate and enable fraud. Nothing more. It\u2019s trivial to implement. I could implement a scalable secure voting solution at home in a matter of weeks. It is inexcusable. \n\nSource: I have a BS and MS in computer science and decades of specialization in information security.",
            "Because you can't make a voting system that's easy for the average person to access and still have it be sufficiently secure from potential hackers trying to manipulate voter data.",
            "Worth watching [this video](https://youtu.be/LkH2r-sNjQs) about it if you have 12 minutes to spare.",
            "I used to think the same thing. This is honestly the best video I have seen explaining why. \n[https://youtu.be/LkH2r-sNjQs](https://youtu.be/LkH2r-sNjQs)",
            "This video by Tom Scott explains it quite well. Basically for online monetary transactions, there is tons of security based around tying your transactions to your identity. ID numbers, bank codes, SS numbers, pins, etc. But in the constitution of, as far as I know, every democracy on earth, voting has to be anonymous, and poll taxes are illegal. So your voting database can\u2019t have the votes tied to identities, which makes it very hard to verify. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/LkH2r-sNjQs",
            "Because there are two critical things about voting, anonymity and security. You don't want people to know how you voted, because that opens the door to potential retaliation, so anonymity is 100% a must. Election security is also a huge deal, you don't want to leave any doors open for foreign or domestic interference. \n\nOnline voting and electronic voting in general just open up potential flaws all around. The biggest and most obvious change is now all the ballots are going to one place presumably, some server that is counting and maintaining the ballots. Someone gets access to this server? Suddenly every vote submitted to it has the potential of being deleted, altered, or recognized. \n\nAlso, there's a huge question of where your ballot actually goes after you let go of it. At least where I live in Massachusetts, you drop the ballot into the SEALED ballot box or ballot counter when you vote. No one see's who i voted for, no one else touches my ballot.  With online, how do you know no one is touching your seeing your ballot? How do you even know its getting counted?\n\nYou're just opening wayyy too many doors for potential interference. Keep it offline, and preferably keep it on paper. even electronic voting at polling places isn't a great idea either.\n\n[Tom Scott](https://youtu.be/LkH2r-sNjQs) has a good video that goes more in detail.",
            "Dude the Russians regularly flex their muscles to show us they can hack the power grid and the voter roll databases. They only don\u2019t fuck with it because it would start a war. You do not want your vote to be without a physical paper trail.",
            "Remember also that millions of those transactions are faked, disrupted, or otherwise illegally influenced every day. It might not happen *to you*, but it happens all the time, and that's just normal internet traffic. A major election would draw all the normal criminals, *and* hackers from every major intelligence agency in the world. How could we possibly trust those results? Especially in an election as close as this one. We might not even find out about any intrusions into local systems until after the results had been certified, if we found out at all!\n\nIn effect, the potential for fraud would be extreme, and it would be very difficult to verify the results without confirming with each voter in person. So at that point you might as well have in-person voting and skip all the risk and mess.\n\nBut even beyond whether it's \"safe\" or not, it'd be far more expensive and complicated. Remember that in the US we don't have one national election, we have 53 individual state elections (50 states + DC, Nebraska 2, Maine 2). So you'd have to set up individual IT infrastructure in every state, and inumerable individual localities, with their own security teams, management, etc. Even ignoring all the normal difficulties of setting up a new state agency that only works every 2 years, there's *already* a major shortage of IT professionals in the country. Finding enough people to work on a part time basis would be extremely difficult, not to mention expensive.\n\nSo, in effect, there are a bunch of fairly significant problems that can be avoided by simply having paper ballots, even if they're less efficient, take longer to count, and have their own security problems.",
            "You, as an individual, have security by obscurity.  Nobody is making a concerted effort to corrupt *your* data in transit or defraud *you* on those platforms, in particular.  It's not that those platforms are secure, it's that you aren't worth destroying, generally speaking.\n\nNational elections are a prime target.  No online security can hold up to a dedicated attack.",
            "I looked into this years ago and concluded that you don't even need security to vote online. You need a website and some Javascript. Voters go to a page that does identity verification. Once they are verified, they are removed from further voting and they vote under a eight-digit private voter ID that simply increments as voting continues, first voter is 00000001, and so on. The voter can use their private voter ID to view their voting on an ever-growing list of votes by precinct or whatever. EVERYONE can see the results as they happen. Election nerds can analyze the voting any way they want, but there really is no way to cheat it or fake it or see who voted how. Anyone and everyone can be called on to verify the page shows their vote correctly if there is doubt. \"John Smith, please go to the results page and let us know your results are correct according to your private voter ID.\" \n\nAnyone who tried to hack it to inject votes would have to fake entire blocks of IDs and that isn't possible. The key here is that the only part of the process that has to be private is the identity. The rest is completely public.",
            "Another aspect could be that it's much more difficult to force you to vote a certain way at a voting station with a ton of people checking that everything's happens correctly. If you could vote from your computer at home someone could hold a gun to your head and look over your shoulder to ensure that you vote the way they want.",
            "Answer: it probably isn't. People are just apprehensive because data could be distorted by hackers if the government does not properly secure/encrypt the data.",
            "It\u2019s because the electoral college is full of boomers that don\u2019t understand the world as it is today.",
            "Maybe some of the emerging technologies like block chain could make online voting more secure. Something that can be audited with full transparency.",
            "Tom Scott did a great video on the subject",
            "There simply is no scientific reason contradicting that. The only problem ist that most of the people are too old to understand this or don't believe/understand the new technologies. And as long these old or ignorant people make up a significant part of our societys there will be hard fighting against that.",
            "[Tom Scott did a brilliant video on this](https://youtu.be/LkH2r-sNjQs)",
            "Because a dollar doesn\u2019t magically turn into 10 dollars. Also money isn\u2019t generated from nothing. (Theoretically)\n\nA vote is generated, it could be: counted, not counted, or changed. \n\nIt\u2019s not rocket science. \n\nIf someone counting 100 ballots decides, I\u2019m going to change all of these, although unethical and very illegal, absolutely does happen. \n\nOr \n\nIf someone counting 100 ballots decides, I\u2019m not going to count all of these, although unethical and very illegal, absolutely does happen. \n\n\nThe issue is: people 4 years ago saying there was voter fraud and now saying there is no voter fraud.

Which typically a good thing unless you consider the vast amounts of false information out there.",
            "As a lot of people have said we are technically in a time of unprecedented peace. And quality of life for most Americans is good. But you have to qualify that praise comparing it to the past. It\u2019s pretty hard to regress to standards of the past. And we are far from perfect. There are still conflicts, and tensions are very high. But we are approaching a time where war is not finically viable. \n\nHaving access to all of human knowledge in the palm of your hand is Both a blessing and a curse. We live in a unique time where generations have different understanding of the most powerful invention maybe in all of human history. The greatest gen and boomers have little to no understanding on how to properly utilize or navigate in this new world. Where gen x and millennials grew up with its rise, and lastly gen z being the first growing up in a world dominated by it.\n\nAs far as racial tensions, there has always been tension it\u2019s just not been so face off. Movements like BLM are fighting for almost the same reasons they were in the 60s. The difference is that social media has created accountability. Scenarios like George Floyd would probably not even be a foot note in a newspaper, but with everyone having a camera it became a grim moment for the world. And arguably still no accountability, it is something we still need to work on. \n\nGlobal warming is also something we\u2019ve been well aware of for decades, it is a very serious issue, but why it seems more serious now is because an entire generation seems resigned to make no efforts to curb the emissions or reform because the fallout will happen long after they pass. \n\nDepending on your age ( and I assume you are probably on the younger side) you are probably coming to realize what you will have to be fighting for during your life. We may never go to war but there are many things that need to be addressed\n\n\u201cUnless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, Nothing is going to get better. It's not.\u201d \u2015 Dr. Seuss",
            "This [book](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Better_Angels_of_Our_Nature) by Steven Pinker is a very thorough analysis of that question. Worth a read for sure.",
            "The world is actually much better, and improving. If you want to be convinced, read \"Factfulness\" or watch any video online by its author, Hans Rosling. Life is better now, on the whole, for masses of people. There is hope for the future, too.\n\nRacial unrest is more visible now, but life for the downtrodden races is much better than it was even 50 years ago (and FAR better than 200 years ago). COVID is being solved through technology. Pollution is far better, child mortality is far better, living standards are far better, food scarcity and famine response are much improved. The 20th century had two unimaginably destructive world wars, but there's no good reason we should ever have a third.\n\nEven climate change is not guaranteed to be a catastrophe. It is upon us, and probably can't be reversed, but humans can choose to solve the problems it creates, or not. Just like humans choose to have genocides, or not. There is nothing inevitable about the human suffering that may result from climate change.",
            "Great book about this is \"Better Angels of Nature\" by Steven Pinker focusing specifically on violence. I hear a lot \"the world has gone crazy\" and there may fluctuations here and there but for the most part violence is down, the world isn't engulfed in a constant state of war, people are materially better, etc. Not to minimize anyone's suffering but this seems to be rarely appreciated because you obviously only live in the present and can't \"feel\" the past.",
            "Look up a book I cant recall the name but the authors name is Steven Pinker.\n\nHe is a well renowned psychologist very respected in the industry and he did a study. Basically took in statistical and historical data on almost every metric you can think of we would rate happiness in.\n\nThe numbers show in quite literally every way the world is getting better every single year with only a few dips here and there usually due to wars. But over all quality of life is unquestionably and vastly better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe problem isn't that people are more aware its, in my opinion a combination of a few things. When life gets easier and easier we start to over exaggerate smaller things and make them appear vastly more significant than they actually are. The second is media, fear, propaganda, war, death etc these things sell. The less of if it there is the more you have to blow up every single story to the point were something barely newsworthy is all anyone can talk about so it seems like it's a massive problem. In reality, it isn't.",
            "Pretty sure there has always been the 'WE ARE DOOMED' crowd.  Look at religions: they forecast the end of the world constantly.  Like, over and over and over and over.  Doomsayers are out to make a profit.  It's all a scam.  Global warming is real, but it won't be as catastrophic as some people claim.",
            "The world is leagues better than what it was before.  It's a matter of coverage now; to simplify an whole bucket of snakes without having to open it: news media, social media, and the lack of fact-checking & integrity is something illogically, horrifically, common and normalized.\n\nBut a more drastic and decisive example for the sake of brevity: Life expectancy in the 18th century was 41 years.\n\nAnd, for a bit of context in regards to one of the larger causes of early death: [this](https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality#child-mortality-achieving-the-global-goal-for-2030-would-be-a-huge-achievement-but-we-are-currently-far-away) at its worst is still much better than what it was before. \n\nIn summation: The world is pretty shitty.   But god ***DAMN*** was it shittier before.  It's just that information is indeed full of shit in terms of quality and type.",
            "Steven Pinker wrote a whole book on this subject called \u201cEnlightenment Now\u201d. Things for humans are objectively better than they ever have been for all of human history. It just might not seem like it because we get the news of what all of the very worst people on the planet are doing delivered to our phones every time we turn them on.",
            "I would actually go all the way to the other direction: things are incredibly awesome now, but people have gotten incredibly whiney. I remember when I was little and my mom and I got bumped up to first class on an airplane. It was the most incredible experience - everyone got their OWN tv with SIX movies to choose from to watch! I felt like freaking royalty. Now I can watch virtually every movie or TV show of all time instantly on my crisp giant hd tv I got for practically nothing at Costco.\n\n\nOne example that particularly irritates me is all the internet people who whine about amazon, as if amazon wasn't like, literally the greatest thing that ever happened to them. Imagine trying to get through covid without amazon. Imagine how much further your dollar goes now that you can instantly comparison shop on a massive integrated platform. It's like a magic genie of your very own.",
            "Honestly it\u2019s neither. The world is objectively better and we\u2019re less aware of *reality* now than ever before. Yea, having access to information used to be a huge problem. But now we have too much access to blatantly bullshit information, so it\u2019s turned the corner.",
            "My take is that we are simultaneously at the highest point of humanity and the lowest. I don't think any other time period humanity has gone through can be described the same.\n\nKeeping it simple:\n\nWe have all this fancy technology making our lives so much better, while simultaneously we are causing things like global warming. We can say for certain that our ancestors weren't causing the planet to literally die -- because they did not have the means to do so.\n\nThe drama of the 19th century was \"so-so country is colonizing so-so place\", not \"we have to stop fucking up the planet or we will destroy everything\"",
            "The world is by far the best it has ever been. Life expectancy is the highest its ever been. Crime is as low as its ever been, war is deadlier that in the far past but conflicts are not as common/widespread as in the distant past, many countries treat women as equals, most countries, and the list goes on. \n\nI don't mean to say things are perfect now but for most of human history the majority of humanity was malnourished, the infant mortality rate was around 50%, and crime was rampant/unsolvable",
            "The world is the safest it\u2019s ever been and our quality of life is the best in human history. It\u2019s important to keep this in mind.",
            "I don\u2019t think the wold is shittier than before. There\u2019s a couple of things to consider when thinking about this.\n\n1) Globalisation & The age of internet: We\u2019ve never been more connected than today. Thanks to the internet, we now have access to pretty much everything there is out there. With a simple search you can look at whats happening around the world. In the 1950s for example that wouldn\u2019t have been possible. Sure you might have gotten news in a newspaper, but there wouldn\u2019t be enough pages or resources to get all the new happening around the world\n\n2) The media and what you consume: Unfortunately, sometimes what you see is what you get. Nowadays the media is shining a spotlight on all the problems of the world. When you consume this information on a daily basis, it becomes harder and harder to think of the positives that are happening. The reason they shine a spotlight on the \u201cnegative\u201d things is because it gets viewers, simple as that.\n\nTake 2020 for example, the entire world was fixated on these things:\n\n- Covid\n- Australian Wildfires\n- Lebanon port explosion\n- Kobe Bryant\u2019s death\n\nThe list goes on and on.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong though, they are terrible things that happened and it was right for the media to shed light on these issues and raise awareness.\n\nBut at the same time, in 2020:\n\n- Africa was declared free of Polio\n- AI solved protein folding, one of biology\u2019s greatest challenges \n- SpaceX launched first ever commercial spaceflight\n- Tesla became the world\u2019s most valuable carmaker, a clear indicator of the huge momentum behind electric cars\n- The internet survived the biggest capacity stress test in history\n- Scientists ran an artificial sun at 100 million degrees for 20 seconds, an important step towards sustainable fusion power\n- Researchers found a way to turn CO2 into jet fuel\n- A new enzyme was created with the potential to break down plastic bottles in hours\n- Amazing researchers, scientists, and healthcare professionals around the globe helped develop, trial & deploy multiple COVID vaccines in less than 12 months! \n\n(Source of the positives were copied from a post by Martin Harbech on LinkedIn)",

            "I know this is no stupid questions but when asking this, does maybe the Holocaust come to mind and think man, that must\u2019ve been the shittiest time?  Maybe the brutality of trench warfare in WW1? Maybe the Black Plague? Maybe the Spanish flu? \n\nOr maybe when people had to go and burn shit to get rid of it, that must\u2019ve been shitty too. \n\nBut due to social media and news channels, everything is the worst always and anything upsetting is going to awaken the 4 horsemen of the apocalypse. \n\nHonestly, this is obviously the best time to be alive. Of course, depending where you\u2019re from, some countries are still quite wartorn or poor. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re from a cushy country if you think COVID is the worst thing to ever happen in the world or that the world is more racist now than it ever was, which to me sounds insane as I type this.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, there are plenty of racial injustices, but looking at recent history, you think this is worse than actually owning slaves?",
            "The depressing fact is..\n\nThe world has never been better than it is now. You read that right. Never in the history of the world have so few been starving, poor, indentured. Many of our current issues like mental health have only surfaced because people have mental energy to devote to something other than working towards sustenance. The world has never been more peaceful, more egalitarian and more fair. The powerful have never been held more accountable, and there has never been so much information available. Every \"first world problem\" is going to be a \"human problem\" one day, it's just hard to focus on them when your next meal is uncertain, as it has been for most of history. Lower middle class urban people today in many aspects live more comfortably than Queen Victoria did.\n\nAlso, it's difficult to internalize how big the world is. Most people alive today have seen the world population double. It is easy to compare, say, 10 dead protesters today with 10 lynched slaves in 1820, but the world of 1820 was an order of magnitude smaller, information was the speed of a horse and the relationship of master and slave was a fact of life that few questioned - everything today is orders of magnitude less significant and more scrutinized.\n\nAnd yet the world is still an authoritarian dystopian hellscape. Now that is depressing.",

            "Excellent question, I think most answers here are on point. Especially compared with a period like 1900-1910 the world has improved massively in almost every regard. However, how does the 2010-2020 decennium compare to something like 1980-1990? I wasn't alive at the time, but if I watch history books/videos/etc people were worried that the world was going to shit during the 80s as well. Did something fundamentally get worse over the last 20 years? The only thing I can think of is the massive polarization we're seeing... Or is that something that is artificially amplified by media? Perhaps all extremists in every imaginable group (trump groupies, corona deniers, flat earthers, anti vaxxers, etc etc) are extremely small minorities.",

That would have been a great topic in 2020. In 2012/2013 however I got the weirdest looks and most awfull comments. I was \"A weird unintelligent consipracy thinker.\" And all I did was just waved away like some kind of weird conspiracy. They did it in the end, got a good grade on it too, but only because they were too lazy to come up with a subject. They never wanted to work with me in a group project again, because I made them do \"Some weird conspiracy shit.\"\n\nThe world 7 years back was exactly the same. Yet... we're now more aware of the issues. I'm still a bit mad about it tho'.",
            "Depends what you are looking at.  There are A LOT of things in this world.\n\nRacism is probably better than it was.  Black people enjoy A LOT more freedom than they had in the 1960s, much less the 1800s.  However, everything seems more racially charged now because 1) POC are probably more vocal about their rights and 2) everyone else can finally see it happening.  Previously, if you were a white person living in a very white area, you probably had no clue about the treatment of black people if they didn't report it on TV or radio. \n\nWhen I was a kid, you'd hear stuff like, \"why can't black people just be happy with what they have?\"  The news wasn't showing unarmed black people being shot by cops.  But I'm sure it was still happening.\n\nClimate change is probably worse since it has been getting worse with time, however, the rate of change is probably better than it was at any time post-industrial revolution.\n\nUnrest in the Middle East/Africa seems to be pretty constant, from what I can tell.\n\nPolitics are more divided than they have been in the past.  Looking at Congress throughout the years, there is a larger divide between the two parties more now than ever.  The whole Western world has seemingly gone left while the GOP has gone more right.  Progressives on the left can probably be looked at as moderates in some other countries.  Misinformation on social media stokes that fire.\n\nIt's not all bad, though.  Despite one party trying to bring back the Red Scare, plenty of people dismiss it as fear mongering.  This last presidential election is evidence of that. This is just an example of how more information at our fingertips has led so many people to seek truth and not taking everything they hear as fact.  Sure, you still have some people who think wearing a mask is communism, despite one being a public health directive and the other being an economic theory.

            "The Better Angels of Our Nature was an excellent book by Steven Pinker that covers this. He finds, through exhaustive analysis of existing research and history, that things have been trending toward the better for pretty much all of human history. Conflicts are going down, murders, violent crimes, wars. Life expectancy and standards of living are going up. If you need a good dose of optimism (or at least agathism), this book will do you a world of good. It\u2019s a bit long and in-depth, so I recommend the audible version if you have access. I had a much easier time focusing when it was being read to me.",
            "We are just more aware.  I have sometimes wondered if we are evolving as a species and maybe becoming more aware of human suffering or less numb to it.  When you read through the history of humanity and civilization, so much of it is like a horror novel.  There had to be some level of disconnect to survive it.",
            "The world is improving. \n\nThe bad is over represented, fear still sells.\n\nBy all facts and measures the welfare of every human is improving.",
            "Stop watching news. They only care to push a chaotic agenda to keep you watching their commercial partners. That\u2019s it. They don\u2019t actually take sides, that\u2019s just the surface illusion. They just keep the machine churning. If you don\u2019t care, they don\u2019t make money. \n\nIn terms of your psychology, guess it depends on your perspective. Largely in the past, war settled nearly all conflicts. We have proxies and flares ups, however, I do think that when we do finally have another war, it\u2019ll be worse than ever. In the mean time , times are \u201cbetter\u201d \n\nFocus on bettering yourself and don\u2019t be a political ideologue. It\u2019s a trap by both sides. Good luck.",

            "I didn\u2019t browse all 1.3k comments, so I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a repost, but \u201cThe Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined\u201d by Steven Pinker is 700 pages of accumulated data interpreted by one of the greatest cognitive psychologists of our time that very VERY definitively shows things are better. Of all the privileges that exist (and they do, I know), chronological privilege is far and away the most powerful. The first 100 pages of the book are almost unbearable to read because of the descriptions of the horrors human beings endured on a regular basis for thousands of years.",
            "You need to read the book Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress, by Steven Pinker.\n\nIt makes the very compelling argument that our lives today (and I mean the average life across the globe) is and continues to grow far longer,  better, healthier, happier, and more comfortable than at any other time in history. His arguments are backed by data.\n\nIn short, we are wired to focus on the bad, to completely lose track of long term, slow change, and are bombarded by negative news because their business model rewards ratings and \"if it bleeds, it leads.\"",
            "I've been around since the '80s. Where I lived, things were fine. You had a few crazies, a few racists, but for the most part people along okay. I think crime in big cities was a lot worse, and there was also AIDS. But people seemed to get along better, because we actually had to meet in person to maintain friendships, and when we did that, we had to be careful about what we said ... and maybe politics and such didn't even come up in conversation because we were too busy playing Pictionary or whatever people did for fun back then. Nowadays the internet has really devalued personal interaction while at the same time putting our thoughts on display for everyone at all times, and it's really been a vitriolic combination, I think.",
            "On the contrary, on paper, the world is actually becoming a better and better place every year.\n\nThe news likes to give us bad news because it captivates the audience and makes the most profit.

For the US and a few other countries, they are better but are struggling with a few economic, social, or political exasperated issues where they are making things worse for a lot if not most of the people there. This is based on clear data and fundamental indicators. Feelings are now a lot more inflamed everywhere due to universal access to news and spread of sensational media as well as social media.",
            "I recommend reading a book by Steven Pinker called \"The Better Angels of Our Nature\". He argues that the world is constantly getting better and better. It answers this question better than any of us could.",
            "The world has always been a shitty place, life has always had it's ups and downs. Really, look back at history, some pretty fucked up shit went down, like the holocaust, and slavery. 2020 pales in comparison, when put into perspective.",

            "Idk, I see it as a series of waves with equal and opposite waves that push back. \n\nWe are, imo, at the end of a negative wave or nearing the end. \n\nI think we have the tools to solve the problems we face, and that's all we need. We just need enough stability and focus to enact that change...and it's only become a more focused and clear movement. Things that were once debatable are now fact. We will begin to make steps forward. \n\nWill things get better in the grand scheme? It's hard to tell. \n\nIf anything, Covid...while terrible, could have been much worse and prepared our society for the prospect of something that may be much more dire in the future. \n\nImagine a truly terrible disease that attacked anyone and everyone? We now have a clear understanding of the ramifications as well as actions we must take to prevent that....all of us...and the sacrifices we must make. \n\nThat counts for something. \n\nAdaptations to climate change still happened, slower, but even during a period of history that rejected it and pushed against it in favor of populism and wishful nostalgia. \n\nWe are creating a dialogue about race, immigration, etc...on a global scale and communities are coming to grips with what a globalised world means in the context of being a human. \n\nThere was always going to be pushback. There could still be...but the reality is there is still only a few solutions and one way and those haven't been challenged their foundations only grow stronger.\n\nMisinformation, conspiracy, anger against change, it was all going to happen...but we are still here and we reacted against it and are still here.\n\nWe still have plenty of problems to face...but we made it through some of the worst yet.",

            "We're more aware. The saying \"Ignorance is Bliss\" was only ever meant to be applied to an individual level, like a guy not knowing of his wife's affair or eating some exotic food and not caring about the ingredients as long as it tastes good, or maybe accepting some money from a friend or family member without asking where the money was obtained.\n\nBut now? It's applied on a global level. Sure, being an informed citizen is important and feels... good, to a degree, but the fact is so much depressing news circulates around the world daily and has always been a significant part of history that to be aware of everything all at once due to how easy it is to find information online is just... depressing as all fuck. I'm not even touching on media sensationalism and hate groups actively *trying* to sow discord. I'm just saying learning about human history and being in the \"know\" is so disheartening, it's very hard to not give up hope.\n\nIn fact, this has been known for thousands of years and talked about in myths and legends, where you see deities who are all-knowing leaning towards hating the human race or becoming depressed (yes, gods becoming depressed) or even mythical figures choosing seclusion from all human contact just to stay ignorant and finally enjoy brief times of peace. The internet has made us those mythical beings. It's turned us into \"all-knowing\" people, which is no wonder why millions and millions are choosing to simply disconnect themselves from the internet and even the outside world in general. The human race has and always will be eternally fucked up.",
            "Violent crime has been at a steady decline since 1994(at least as of a 2015 FBI study), europe's last dictator is about to be gotten rid of, Ireland is at peace, and access to proper medical care is on the rise worldwide. The world is far from perfect but our awareness is simply much greater and the 24 hour news keeps people afraid for profit.",
            "The world right now is the best it has ever been (for us humans speaking, for nature it's arguable). Internet definetly just made us aware of everything.",
            "The past was worst. I suggest getting on Wikipedia and reading he topics of major events that happened in the year, oh 1600 and before. I saw a painting of a religious rebellion in France. The river was full of bodies. Imagine being in your hometown or city. Living life peacefully and then some raiders come and violently slaughter your entire family and the ones that were lucky to be left alive were only raped. \n\nOr perhaps you've settled into a nice comfortabke job but suddenly your king has called every able man and teen male to join his army and fight for control over some land. Unlike in today's era in most countries, you don't have a choice. Basic hygiene products are scarce. You get life more often than not. The distractions through entertainment aren't as plentiful. Hard labor or die. No fridges so fresh food spoils quickly unless you ferment it. Also plague after plague after plague hits your city and doctors can only give you medicine to somewhat dull the pain. Life back then was brutal and gross.",
            "Um, 1939-1945 would like a word with you.  And before that, 1918, what with WW1 plus their pandemic that killed 50 million worldwide.\n\nThen again it's only January of 2021, so WW3 might still be waiting for a Global Warming Pandemic surprise party for the human race.",
            "I feel the world has always been shitty but we're now made more aware of it. I also feel that technology has also had an impact making the world shittier by forcing us to always be \"connected\". At one point you could stop and take a breather so to speak because life moved a bit slower. Now it seems like everything has to be \"Now\" and if you're a second late it's not good enough.",

            "Were just more aware of it. Even with how shit everything is most people are living better than people a hundred years back did. Sure we're in lock down but at least you aren't shitting in a bucket and taking it outside to throw into the river or sprinting after an animal for dinner.",
            "The world is mostly much better. \n\nSure, there's occasional dips, and certainly nature and climate are an issue, but we're doing more and being more aware than ever before. \n\nOur mental health and stress levels may be worse off... Depending on the point of time you compare to. \n\nPart of it is the temporal perspective. 30 years is not a long time in history, so if something gets worse for 30 years and then gets better, that barely registers as a dip, really. And.... For an example, US healthcare costs are just abysmal, but the actual quality of treatment is incredibly better than 30 years ago, if you can afford it, so it isn't that it's ONLY gotten worse.",
            "It's worse because motivated idiots are using it to mobilize and convert others. \n\nIt used to be there was only 5 idiots per town and they were pretty much harmless.",
            "Yes. Society has become much colder overall I think. Small businesses are being overwhelmed by monopolies. Your wages used to get you much further back in the 70's which meant life was much less stressful and people were free to do more with their money. That sort of freedom feels like a pipe dream now.\n\nCapitalism has kind of gone stagnant and it's affecting all aspects of life. There was a time when modern society would react and gear up to a world threatening crisis like climate change immediately but now that business is the biggest driving force nothing is done that might affect the status quo of large businesses.\n\nI do think the internet has some part to play because it is widely used to spread misinformation but it could also swing the other way if we just taught people how to manage it correctly. It's more a symptom of a broken system.\n\nCapitalism needs an overhaul but that isn't going to happen and things are going to get worse as a result. Maybe, just maybe we will get our shit together when we are given an ultimatum of world ending destruction.",
            "It might have been better 1 year ago, 5 years ago, or perhaps even 10 years ago, but it arguably wasn't better 50 years ago for the vast majority of people, and most certainly was not better 100 years ago for pretty much everyone.   \n\n\nThere will always be certain classes of people throughout history that 'had it good' - usually the exceptionally wealthy - but even Egyptian Pharoahs died of horrific, crippling diseases. I would rather live as a poor person now than the richest person 5000 years ago.",

            "I think it depends\u2014in terms of societal progress, the world is better. More equality, more freedom, etc. Definitely a far cry from how people were treated even just like 50 years ago. However, in terms of the quality of the planet, definitely shittier. This is to be expected when the population keeps growing, more mouths to feed, more waste produced, more harm to the planet.  \n\nWhile it may seem like the world is shittier now, it definitely isn\u2019t. OP answered their own question: the internet has just made us more aware of the bad stuff. It\u2019s always been happening, but now the info is just a few clicks away.

The EMTs tried their best to save you, but to no avail. Your body was so utterly shattered you were better off, trust me.\nAnd that\u2019s when you met me.\n\u201cWhat\u2026 what happened?\u201d You asked. \u201cWhere am I?\u201d\n\u201cYou died,\u201d I said, matter-of-factly. No point in mincing words.\n\u201cThere was a\u2026 a truck and it was skidding\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYup,\u201d I said.\n\u201cI\u2026 I died?\u201d\n\u201cYup. But don\u2019t feel bad about it. Everyone dies,\u201d I said.\nYou looked around. There was nothingness. Just you and me. \u201cWhat is this place?\u201d You asked. \u201cIs this the afterlife?\u201d\n\u201cMore or less,\u201d I said.\n\u201cAre you god?\u201d You asked.\n\u201cYup,\u201d I replied. \u201cI\u2019m God.\u201d\n\u201cMy kids\u2026 my wife,\u201d you said.\n\u201cWhat about them?\u201d\n\u201cWill they be all right?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I like to see,\u201d I said. \u201cYou just died and your main concern is for your family. That\u2019s good stuff right there.\u201d\nYou looked at me with fascination. To you, I didn\u2019t look like God. I just looked like some man. Or possibly a woman. Some vague authority figure, maybe. More of a grammar school teacher than the almighty.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I said. \u201cThey\u2019ll be fine. Your kids will remember you as perfect in every way. They didn\u2019t have time to grow contempt for you. Your wife will cry on the outside, but will be secretly relieved. To be fair, your marriage was falling apart. If it\u2019s any consolation, she\u2019ll feel very guilty for feeling relieved.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d you said. \u201cSo what happens now? Do I go to heaven or hell or something?\u201d\n\u201cNeither,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019ll be reincarnated.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d you said. \u201cSo the Hindus were right,\u201d\n\u201cAll religions are right in their own way,\u201d I said. \u201cWalk with me.\u201d\nYou followed along as we strode through the void. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d\n\u201cNowhere in particular,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s just nice to walk while we talk.\u201d\n\u201cSo what\u2019s the point, then?\u201d You asked. \u201cWhen I get reborn, I\u2019ll just be a blank slate, right? A baby. So all my experiences and everything I did in this life won\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\u201cNot so!\u201d I said. \u201cYou have within you all the knowledge and experiences of all your past lives. You just don\u2019t remember them right now.\u201d\nI stopped walking and took you by the shoulders. \u201cYour soul is more magnificent, beautiful, and gigantic than you can possibly imagine. A human mind can only contain a tiny fraction of what you are. It\u2019s like sticking your finger in a glass of water to see if it\u2019s hot or cold. You put a tiny part of yourself into the vessel, and when you bring it back out, you\u2019ve gained all the experiences it had.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been in a human for the last 48 years, so you haven\u2019t stretched out yet and felt the rest of your immense consciousness. If we hung out here for long enough, you\u2019d start remembering everything. But there\u2019s no point to doing that between each life.\u201d\n\u201cHow many times have I been reincarnated, then?\u201d\n\u201cOh lots. Lots and lots. An in to lots of different lives.\u201d I said. \u201cThis time around, you\u2019ll be a Chinese peasant girl in 540 AD.\u201d\n\u201cWait, what?\u201d You stammered. \u201cYou\u2019re sending me back in time?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I guess technically. Time, as you know it, only exists in your universe. Things are different where I come from.\u201d\n\u201cWhere you come from?\u201d You said.\n\u201cOh sure,\u201d I explained \u201cI come from somewhere. Somewhere else. And there are others like me. I know you\u2019ll want to know what it\u2019s like there, but honestly you wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d you said, a little let down. \u201cBut wait. If I get reincarnated to other places in time, I could have interacted with myself at some point.\u201d\n\u201cSure. Happens all the time. And with both lives only aware of their own lifespan you don\u2019t even know it\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\u201cSo what\u2019s the point of it all?\u201d\n\u201cSeriously?\u201d I asked. \u201cSeriously? You\u2019re asking me for the meaning of life? Isn\u2019t that a little stereotypical?\u201d\n\u201cWell it\u2019s a reasonable question,\u201d you persisted.\nI looked you in the eye. \u201cThe meaning of life, the reason I made this whole universe, is for you to mature.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean mankind? You want us to mature?\u201d\n\u201cNo, just you. I made this whole universe for you. With each new life you grow and mature and become a larger and greater intellect.\u201d\n\u201cJust me? What about everyone else?\u201d\n\u201cThere is no one else,\u201d I said. \u201cIn this universe, there\u2019s just you and me.\u201d\nYou stared blankly at me. \u201cBut all the people on earth\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAll you. Different incarnations of you.\u201d\n\u201cWait. I\u2019m everyone!?\u201d\n\u201cNow you\u2019re getting it,\u201d I said, with a congratulatory slap on the back.\n\u201cI\u2019m every human being who ever lived?\u201d\n\u201cOr who will ever live, yes.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m Abraham Lincoln?\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re John Wilkes Booth, too,\u201d I added.\n\u201cI\u2019m Hitler?\u201d You said, appalled.\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re the millions he killed.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m Jesus?\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re everyone who followed him.\u201d\nYou fell silent.\n\u201cEvery time you victimized someone,\u201d I said, \u201cyou were victimizing yourself. Every act of kindness you\u2019ve done, you\u2019ve done to yourself. Every happy and sad moment ever experienced by any human was, or will be, experienced by you.\u201d\nYou thought for a long time.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d You asked me. \u201cWhy do all this?\u201d\n\u201cBecause someday, you will become like me. Because that\u2019s what you are. You\u2019re one of my kind. You\u2019re my child.\u201d\n\u201cWhoa,\u201d you said, incredulous. \u201cYou mean I\u2019m a god?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Not yet. You\u2019re a fetus. You\u2019re still growing. Once you\u2019ve lived every human life throughout all time, you will have grown enough to be born.\u201d\n\u201cSo the whole universe,\u201d you said, \u201cit\u2019s just\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAn egg.\u201d I answered. \u201cNow it\u2019s time for you to move on to your next life.\u201d\nAnd I sent you on your way.",

But the manipulative message prompts just piss me off. Like there's one that says \"rate the game?\" And then you can push yes of course but instead of no you have to push \"I don't want to help\". Even the ones that promise virtual items/upgrades/coins etc for a rating. Because if they have to buy a rating then what is it really worth? What are they hiding by bribing their way to good ratings? My preferred message style just be a simple reminder, no more than once per day, with a message about how ratings are very important to game app developers success and if you liked the game they would appreciate if you could leave a rating. I've always been way more responsive to straightforwardness in marketing",

Some are great at hiding the alcohol taste, and some are very talented at highlighting the other flavors of the alcohol.\n\nAll in all, it isn't a must.

Bailey's + milk for example, tastes like chocolate milk if you mix it right. Sourz (you take shots with it) is usually a little hint of alcohol but too sour to notice it. Licor 43 + milk or cold blueberry soup + heavy cream (non-whipped) is awesome in general. \n\n27 atm, still can't drink beer or whiskey/rum/vodka on the ice without wanting to puke. Long Island iced tea might be another idea. If it's made correctly it shouldn't taste alcohol at all but after 1-3 of them you'll need a cab or driver to get home. \n\nAlso try 4-4.5% ciders.

For two weeks he waited to hear the verdict as to whether he would get to keep his dream job which allowed him to live a very comfortable life.   I watched a 55 year old man cry every day about how he fucked up.  He didn't lose his job but it did push him to stop drinking.  One day he asked me to come by his house and write the checks to pay his bills because he was shaking so bad he couldn't write.\n\nNOTHING and I mean NOTHING about drinking is good.

You should be thrilled you can\u2019t stand the taste. It\u2019ll be a great reason not to start down the path to misery.",
            "It's fine to not like alcohol! You can thank yourself when you're 101 years old and still healthy. The rest of us are gonna trade the back 20 in exchange for drinks that stress our livers and make us act funny.\n\nWhat you might notice is that if you're out with friends, and you say you don't drink because you don't like it, I guarantee they're gonna ask you to try some alcohol they like that they're SURE you'll like. And you might like it! It's not a big deal, and if you don't like it that's fine too, and if you don't want to try it, power to ya!\n\nI guess what I'm saying is that for people who don't drink or don't like alcohol, the alcohol scene is probably really annoying. So just be prepared for that, and try to have fun!",
            "Try keeping decent vodka in the freezer (it doesn't freeze at those temps) and then make drinks with decent mixer like fever tree and ice, or even orange juice. Basically colder the better, a mistake I made a lot when I first started drinking was room temp vodka",
            "Alcohol always tastes like alcohol. It's not a \"good\" flavor for a reason, it's literally a toxic substance to your body. I am 50 and haven't drank since I turned 21, when I realized I never liked alcohol and only drank to be with friends. It's not worth it.",
            "First of \"as a dude\" - what does gender have to do with it? And why does it need to get better? It sounds like a case of \"get better friends\". \n\nIf you don't like the taste then you don't like the taste. It doesn't have to get better, there is no need for that. Even if everyone else drinks it, doesn't mean you have to join them. And in case they can't accept it, throw those people out.\n\nSidenote: *\"lady drinks\"*?! Wow. I thought we moved on from that part of toxic masculinity/sexism.",
            "Honestly alcohol makes you lose neurones and gives better chances at cancer so you're not losing anything.",
            "You don\u2019t have to drink, man.\n\nAlso, vodka is awful. Try a gin and tonic. If that doesn\u2019t do it for you, that\u2019s fine.\n\nEdit: Oh, or an Old Fashioned. I\u2019ve been getting into the, sort of recently.",
            "It doesn\u2019t have to. If you don\u2019t like it, just don\u2019t. While I don\u2019t mind alcohol, it took me several years to finally admit that, as a natural introvert, I NEVER enjoyed going clubbing. You were young, and it was just something you were \u201csupposed\u201d to do. Eventually I just quit, and spared myself both the expense and the tedium.\n\nJust don\u2019t - your health and your wallet will be better off.",
            "You might find something you like eventually, I also dislike 90% of wines, 99% of beers, and like 75% of other drinks.  I like one or two types of ciders, only one type of beer, and I make some amazing cocktails because for the most part I hate the taste of all the rest.    \n\n\nYou also might just be someone who can't stand the taste of alcohol, in which case you don't need to drink it.",
            "Bruh you\u2019re going to be sober and flush with cash.  Don\u2019t even try to develop a taste for $15 drinks.",
            "Try not to drink at all\u2026you will get further ahead in life",
            "Different people have different taste preferences. For me it is coffee. I can\u2019t stand the smell of it, the taste of it, can\u2019t bear a single sip of it. No matter how much I\u2019ve tried, I can\u2019t stand it. That is how a lot of people are with alcohol or certain types.",
            "It begins to taste better as you get more stupid.",
            "30F here. Spent my 20s pretending alcohol tasted good (or at least neutral) to be \"tough\". Now I mix my wine with grape-juice and am much happier.   \n\n\nI promise you, you're not the only one you're just the only one ADMITTING it.",
            "If you don't like it, you don't have to drink it. Alcohol isn't vital to life. I'm 40 and rarely drink just because I don't like the way it tastes. Plus getting over a hangover at 35+ takes twice as long.",
            "37M. I never enjoyed alcohol.\n\nUsed to go clubbing with my friends in my 20s. I put way too much coke or sprite or any mixer than the alcohol.\n\nThere are 1 brand of wine that I really like because it doesn't taste as sour as other brands. And that's about it.",
            "You need good beer. Try different types. Other alcohol may be your drink. Also, you may be one of the many people who don't like alcohol at all. Just be the designated driver when you go out. Have you tried a Cape Cod.  Cranberry juice, vodka and a squeeze of lime. Or a long Island iced tea. Be careful of that one. I thought I was ordering actual tea and drank 4.",
            "At 26, I finally got the nerve up to say \"I hate alcohol \" and just became the mom friend who drove all the drunks.  Not always fun, but my drinks are on the house and everyone gets home safely. \nThere are now some delicious non alcoholic concoctions. Check out Alchemy!",
            "You could be allergic or reactive to fermentation. Or oak because a lot of alcohols are stored in wood. \n\nUsually when we don\u2019t like something it\u2019s because we can\u2019t digest it. \n\nOr you might just not like it. Which is fine. Be happy about all the money you\u2019ll save!",
            "Gets better the worse your life gets.",
            "Drinking black coffee actually helped me appreciate beer more lol",
            "To paraphrase Jim Jefferies, \u201cwe don\u2019t drink because we like the taste, we drink because we have to.\u201d",
            "The best thing to happen to you is not enjoying.",
            "Coming from a recovering alcoholic and liver transplant recipient, be grateful you don't like alcohol. Im not trying to preach but you don't need booze to have a good time. Just my 2 cents.",
            "I\u2019m 32. I\u2019ve hated alcohol since the second I tasted it. From 18-22 I powered through. Then I realized I was adult and didn\u2019t have to do stuff I didn\u2019t want too. I\u2019ve probably had 10 drinks since then. Usually a Long Island because it tastes the closest to a normal drink.",
            "It\u2019s an acquired taste, like black coffee. You don\u2019t have to like it because your friends like it. You don\u2019t have to drink. Whenever I do want to drink I find the only stuff I do like, because it\u2019s strong and I can actually deal with the flavor, and drink.",
            "Seneca once said something along the lines of: \"The fact that a lot of people do a thing is often reason enough alone not to do it.\"\n\nAlcohol sucks.",
            "They don't taste good, you get used to the taste with continued exposure.",
            "It doesn't get better. It's absolutely fine to not like the taste of alcoholic drinks. Be true to yourself.",
            "Alchohol is a poison, and the culture that wants you to spend your money chasing the illusion is as well.  \n\n\nSource- drank for 20 years for the same reason, kept thinking it was gonna get good at some point.  It never does.",
            "The further you slip into alcoholism, the better the drink tastes. It\u2019s acquired like any other flavor, but you also begin to associate it with being happy. Over time as you slip further and further, it starts to wreak havoc on your health both physical and mental, but the alcohol ensures that you forget the bad times, and so you drink and you drink, and you enjoy the flavor and you enjoy the feeling\u2026 except for when you don\u2019t enjoy the feeling, and then you forget and you drink.\n\nDo yourself a favor, and don\u2019t let that become your life. If you don\u2019t like alcohol now, keep it that way.",
            "Some people just don't like it period.  But your least disgusting option might be a wine cooler of a flavor you can live with or a hard lemonade or hard seltzer.  If you don't like any of those then you just don't like alcohol and probably never will.",
            "Some people just don't have the taste buds for it. Not much you can do",
            "If you desperately want to get drunk you don\u2019t notice the taste as much. When I was 17 I apparently drank a whole bottle of vodka at a party. I obviously had a bad time, embarrassed myself, threw up a bunch and fell unconscious for the rest of the night. Thankfully I was young so the hangover was just a mild headache, nausea and confusion. But ever since then I can\u2019t stand the taste of spirits. The older I get the worse it tastes. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bad thing\n\nIf you really want to desensitise yourself in order to enjoy alcohol just start with like 4% alcohol and high sugar content. You won\u2019t like it at first but you get used to it",
            "I think if you don't like it then you don't like it. There's nothing wrong with that. I will say, when I started to drink I did not like beer at all, but I've come to enjoy some different styles. So that's maybe something that will change for you if you keep trying different beers.",
            "When your back brain decides it likes being drunk and starts sending memos to the executive function saying how much \u201cwe\u201d like this stuff.",
            "I have always found beer disgusting except for sours. My taste for wine evolved...I started with blushes and fruit wines. I always liked ciders. Have you tried vodka and cranberry juice? Can barely taste the vodka. Or try drinks with lemon or limes: whiskey sour, lemon drop, margaritas. If needed adjust the alcohol amount where you can't taste it.",
            "What is the rest of your palette like? Do you enjoy things like Brussel sprouts and other veggies and a variety of ethnic foods or are you more a chicken nuggets and fries person?",
            "It might never get better. I was looking forward to drinking as a young adult after seeing so many pictures of musicians I idolized with bottles and cans. I tried all the booze I saw in the pictures and it all tasted horrible. People used to say they were going to \"find me a drink\" but over time everyone stopped caring about it. Now people just think I'm in recovery, a Muslim, or the designated driver.",
            "Maybe you just don't like it. I thought beer tasted good when my dad let me try a sip at 12.",
            "Drink whatever you want. I hate beer and would rather do shots and martinis. I just don't like bitter things hell i don't even drink coffee. Find what you like drink that. Also don't worry about optics. No matter what you do people are going to judge you.",
            "Do you go around forcing yourself to eat other things you hate?  No of course not, so just stop.  I didn't start drinking until I got married and found a beer that I really liked.  Then I slowly added more and more until now at 45 I kind of enjoy almost all beer, including light beer which I told myself I would never drink.\n\nI wouldn't worry about it, try expensive craft beers once in a while when you're out on the town, but otherwise just forget about it.",
            "You might have an above average number of taste buds.  People like this are called super tasters.  Does ice cream taste super awesome and coffee disgusting?",
            "I\u2019m 20 and I\u2019ve never really been bothered about drinking so when I go out I tend to just order a coke or a J2O (which is considered to be a kids drink I guess, but I definitely recommend the apple and raspberry \ud83d\ude02) but I don\u2019t care because it tastes good and I don\u2019t need to be drunk to have a good time anyway. \n\nI am lucky that my friends are pretty chilled about it anyway and don\u2019t pressure me so that definitely helps.",

            "I still don\u2019t like beer or wine. I\u2019ve found one cocktail I can tolerate/kinda like and that\u2019s all I order when I feel the need to drink socially.\n\nI\u2019d also like to add, I\u2019ve never been peer pressured to take drugs. But, damn is there a lot of peer pressure to drink alcohol.",
            "I personally drink, moderately because I have Asian flush. So I don't go day drikking cus I dont want to walk around Town red and stuff like that.\n\nAnd its really not that bad to be the only one not drikking, you can still enjoy yourself.\n\nAnd if you feel like its wierd to be the only one who doesn't drink, maybe you're just not completely comfortable comfortable around the friend group you're with. In which case you just need to be adamant about your stance (i promise noone will really care or have the time to think about the guy who isnt drinking)"
