As an adult, I now assume they would probably use the opportunity for privacy for sex if they wanted to have it. \n\nIt was totally normal. As a kid I just thought that it was romantic and loving, regularly taking a bath with your spouse. As an adult.... well, I guess I still think that. I\u2019d love to make it a thing in my own life if I can have a reasonable assumption of my child\u2019s safety for a bit- I mean, if there were an emergency, one could just come out of the bathroom.",

Outside of meals and rest, the house is not a place to hang out/spend time.\n\nFor example, I live in southern Italy, my home is 38m\u00b2. A family of 8 lived here before me. Two parents, six kids. That's less than 5m\u00b2/person. This is because kids would spend time in the town square or (in my town's case) the sea, or on bikes or in the fields (when school was out). \n\nSo yeah. There was plenty of time with empty homes. Also, kids are deep sleepers and generally go to bed earlier than parents.\n\nOh, also, I can hear when my neighbors get frisky. I know everyone's business always. So I guess horniness trumps need for privacy. My home is in the historic center, so it's pretty close to the olden days environment.",

Sex in front of your kids is normal until they're of walking age and then you gotta be trickier like send them over to your relatives for the weekend. \n\nIt's normal for your kids to be independent and walk themselves to the park or store even when they're 8-12 years old so you could send them on errands or even bring along the younger ones.\n\nNow that I think about it, my parents gave me a lot more freedom than a typical American family would give their kids and now I understand why.",

            "In high school I had to read a book called \u201cA World Lit Only by Fire\u201d by William Manchester for my European history class. It was the first non-fiction book I ever truly enjoyed and it sparked a lifelong love of history, especially regarding what everyday life was like. It\u2019s about medieval Europe and details all kinds of little things regarding what it was like to live back then. One of the more memorable moments detailed sleeping arrangements and family life. Apparently back then it was very common for the whole family to sleep together to conserve heat. It was also common for any couples in the family sleep pile to just screw right there. We generally think of medieval people as far more conservative than us, and there\u2019s truth to that in some ways, particularly with the aristocracy. But the peasantry were sometimes utterly shameless about things like sex, nudity and death in ways that would shock the modern mind. For example, in summer months they often just worked in the fields bare ass naked. I imagine kids in large families living in close quarters today have probably been desensitized to a lot of stuff like that and it only seems shocking to us because we\u2019re used to the luxury of separate personal spaces.",

            "Privacy as a requirement for sex is a recent, western European invention. Even in western Europe, semi-puplic sex (in parks or bars, for instance) was routine and hardly even remarked upon. The general public didn't care all that much one way or the other about it. But the Protestant Reformation, combined with cheaper building materials which made bigger houses possible, changed all that.\n\nBut most of the world didn't go through that process and still traditionally doesn't care about private vs. public sex.

This was the early 1950\u2019s until my youngest Aunt was born in 1971, and they were very Catholic, so it was expected to have a large family. \n\nEventually, they added a bedroom on downstairs on the main floor as their room and had 2 bedrooms upstairs, one for the boys, and one for the girls. They had 6 girls and 4 boys, though only 5 girls ever lived together at once as the age gap between the oldest and youngest was almost 18yrs. Babies slept in my grandparents bedroom until they were 2 or 3 and were potty trained before they went upstairs. \n\nThey only had one bathroom in the house. No shower, just a tub. My grandma wouldn\u2019t let them drain the water between kids either. \n\nBoth my grandparents are deceased, my grandfather fought at Pearl Harbor and is a WWII War Hero, a decorated Police Officer, and a wonderful man. My grandmother was one of the most caring women that I had ever had the pleasure of meeting in my life (Polish women are like that). My grandma would tell you that her and grandpa would have sex every chance they could. Mostly, it was when all the kids were outside playing. Apparently back then, it was easy to get kids to go outside and play. \n\nA quick note: The youngest 2 of my mothers siblings still own the house. They never moved out. My grandparents made provisions so that the house couldn\u2019t be sold without all 10 kids being in agreement, which will never happen. \n\n*TL;DR:* Grandparents who had 10 kids in tiny house said they just did it whenever all the kids were outside playing because it wasn\u2019t that hard in the 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s.",

            "I believe both feelings are valid. You both clearly grew up with different morals when it comes to being in a relationship and going on dates, and that\u2019s totally fine. \n\nPersonally, I have been in a almost four year relationship and my boyfriend pays for 99% of our dates. The only times I pay are for his birthdays. That\u2019s because he grew up in a household where he was told that he should pay for everything, and I grew up in a household being told that the man should pay for everything. So it completely worked out for us and wasn\u2019t a problem on either end. There was a point in the middle of our relationship where he was tight with money and asked me to pay (lasted maybe 2 months) and I was in accordance with that. I did not mind at all, but once he was good with money, he never let me touch my wallet again.  \n\nI know it\u2019s only been 10 dates, but if you really like her and see a future with her, I believe you need to speak to her about this more because financial opinions are really important in a relationship. If anything, the most important. \n\nFor instance, once a couple wants to move in together, it\u2019s important to know what they expect from each other. There are men who say they will pay all the bills and the woman can just purchase things like food or some don\u2019t even want the woman to pay a dime on household items or bills and whatever money she makes, is hers. There are others who would like to go 50/50 on everything. At the end of the day, what matters is that it works out for the both of you. \n\nYour feelings are 100% valid and you have the right to want her to contribute, but she also has the right to not want to.",
            "The way you asked this has a big influence on the situation. If she genuinely thought you were just being nice (eg \"I'll take this one!\" ten times then you suddenly say \"you need to start contributing\" it could be a jarring tonal shift.\n\nIf you were like \"hey can you take some of the date tabs?\" and she responds like that then it's a red flag about her.",

            "Idk. If you really like her, its not a big deal to pay for all dates. Some guys still believe in courting and spoiling in the beginning. Or not having sex for awhile to show her u care that much and wanna wait to make it that much more special. I've only done this with one person but it was all worth it. If shes the right one for u do what u want. It's a relationship because its between 2 ppl. Not a community project",
            "I mean, nobody here has any context. We don't know how you brought it up, what her financial situation is, what your financial situation is, how expensive the previous dates have been, and so on. In the worst case she's either manipulative, entitled, or traditional. All of those suck (unless you want someone traditional) and you should move on. On the other hand, in the best case it could be fine. \n\nExamples where this might be okay: \n\n- If you have money and she's struggling, it seems reasonable for you to pay and I can see why she'd be hurt. When I got a high paying job out of college, and I would go out with people who were still broke students, I would always pay. Obviously. \n\n- The dates so far have been extremely inexpensive (relatively) so it seems petty for you to even ask. Such as a case where you have a picnic in the park together and you pay for gas and food, or you see a cheap movie together, or you go on a hike, etc. Unless you are in a situation where you are both scraping for gas money, it might just seem petty that you would bring this up if you have been spending relatively little money. \n\n- It's not about you paying specifically but more that she feels especially insecure about the relationship for some reason. You paying is one of the only ways you are showing 'investment' in the relationship so if you stop, her needs are no longer being met. In other words, the relationship has some problem and you paying for dates is acting as a bandaid for it. \n\n- You brought it up in a shitty/aggressive way and she was reacting to your tone and demeanor when she said it feels like you don't like her very much. Possibly you have some kind of resentment that is peeking through and she is noticing.\n\nThese are the best case scenarios I can think of off the top of my head, but I think that my point really is that you won't know what her reaction means until you talk to her and figure out what's going on. Relationships are all about communication. I think it is more valuable for you to try to discuss it maturely together rather than asking strangers on Reddit for advice without giving any context in your post. Honestly, the right answer could be anything from leave her ASAP to investing MORE in the relationship, and nobody on Reddit has enough context to be able to tell because you didn't put it in the post.",

            "I've generally heard it used to describe the specific diaspora of black Americans that are descended from enslaved people, but that could just be in the circles I travel in.",
            "It gained traction long ago because of Jessie Jackson. [Here is an old AP article from 1988 explaining it from when it started.](https://apnews.com/article/089fc3ab25b86e14deeefae3adb7a5ad)",
            "It\u2019s a politically correct term which replaced \u201cblack\u201d for a while. It led to some strange things like when a black French woman won an Olympic gold medal, the American commentator described her as the first African-American from any country to win an Olympic gold medal. \n\nWe had a Jamaican family friend who detested being called African-American. And of course, there are plenty of white people from South Africa who are Americans of African descent (as Americans think of it) who nevertheless aren\u2019t African-Americans as the term is used. \n\nAnyways unlike the other nationality-American constructs, African-American is used to refer to race rather then origin.",
            "Not sure how many replies are from actual Americans, but as a US citizen I\u2019m going to chime in.\n\nGrowing up we were taught African American as a politically correct term for black, and it felt much less taboo or aggressive than saying \u201coh that person is black\u201d because in the US the topic of race had been and still is a very touchy subject (try and use Hispanic and Latino interchangeably, there is a difference). For me it\u2019s like that episode of the Office where Oscar says he\u2019s Mexican and Michael stupidly thinks that\u2019s racist because of the word Mexican. In the US there was a lot of negativity around certain racial identifiers for a while because of the whole \u201cI don\u2019t see color\u201d movement.\n\nThe issue is that, like you said, African American is faulty. It\u2019s not always true but it\u2019s used as a catch all for black people. Someone could be from Africa but be white in complexion but by definition they would be an African descendant American and therefore be an African American. You could have a black man from Jamaica who has no ancestral ties to Africa who would be categorized as African American despite the only reason being because of his skin color.\n\nYou\u2019ll notice that a lot of people in recent years in the US have come to this realization and have started reverting back to Black Americans as a descriptor, but it\u2019s still popularly used despite its incorrect nature.",
            "Well since you brought this up. Had a friend few years ago that was born in South Africa- moved to US and was now a citizen. She was completely white. Had hard time explaining to her that she could not call herself an African American even though she was",
            "Americans love to attach themselves to ancestral groups: Italian-Americans, Irish-Americans, Swedish-Americans etc etc. Even if their last ancestor from that country was generations ago.\n\nAfrican Americans (generally) don't have that ability. Their ancestors were brought over as slaves and records of their origin weren't kept. So instead of being Ghanaian-American or Nigerian-American, they are left with 'African American'.",
            "The same reason you're using \"Black Americans\" in your title instead of just saying \"Americans.\"\n\nOf course they are Americans, but in the context of certain conversations about certain topics, we do have to mention race. (And in those same conversations, white Americans get called \"white Americans.\")\n\nBut we usually just say \"black\". \"African American\" was seen as the more politically correct term for a while, but I think that's fading.",
            "To answer your question, it's not just African-Americans that are called other country first and then american. We have a variety of Americans. \nAfrican-American \nMexican-American \nAsian-American \nNative-American \nEuropean-American \nBut with America being mostly caucasian we dont see the term caucasian-American, I think that should speak for itself. Overtime it's become a mixture of cultures and these other cultures define themselves from where there descendants came from. Being Mexican-American myself it's a hard concept to understand because I know nothing of mexico and yet I speak spanish. I know more american history then I know of mexican history. Yet the Mexican is seen first from other Americans, and Mexicans dont really see us as Mexican. We're kinda stuck in this self defining of what being american is, its evolving.",
            "It means \"Americans of African descent via the trans-Atlantic slave trade\" but that's more of a mouthful.",
            "From the perspective of a non-native english speaker: when I learned English a decade and a half ago, we were taught that African-American is basically a synonym for black people",
            "At least when I was a kid in America (about 20 years ago), the idea was that America is a diverse nation and that we should celebrate our diversity by recognizing and honoring it. So, it became politically correct (and also trendy)  to call yourself \"Italian-American\" \"Chinese-American\", \"Polish-American\", at least in official documents. We were recognizing each of these groups as equally legitimate Americans while acknowledging their roots. This made an awkward situation for Black people. A Black person whose family  came to the US during slavery doesn't know which country their ancestors  came from.  They can't really say they're \"Nigerian-American\" or whatever, because their family could be from Ghana or another West African nation. So, the term African-American was born. It recognizes their ancestry and place as Americans.",

            "Because most people in America are descended from someone who came here on a boat in the last few hundred years, people have long attached their ancestry to their identity.  Ask pretty much anyone else in America and they'll tell you what country their people are from even if they don't know the first thing about said country.  St. Patrick's day is a perfect example.  Given most of us black folks don't know what specific country we came from, Africa in general is what gets claimed.\n\nAdd to this racism, the civil rights movement, the afro movement and so on... African-American became the preferred term for a while since we as blacks had no cultural identity other than \"slave,\" and it was taken as a point of pride so we could say we were *from* somewhere like everyone else.  The *problem* with this is most people in America are so hung up in what people look like that any sufficiently brown skinned person, be they from Mexico, Brazil, Jamaica or wherever get assumed to be African.  Which is an affront to their cultural identity and... you see where I'm going.\n\nFrankly, I'd rather be called American or black if you just have to have a visual descriptor, but that's not really up to me.",

            "I've always hated it. I got so sick of being African American I left the US.

Now my passport says I'm American but that place hasn't been home for over a decade, my race is listed as 'other' anywhere it counts and I consider myself as being from nowhere.",
            "It probably came from a p.c. thing. Try this: try to ask your question again but without referring to them as black Americans or African Americans.

You needed to differentiate them.",
            "People in America don\u2019t really say African American anymore and we now say black people or people of color. People of color is just a little too close to \u201ccolored people\u201d to me which used to be a derogatory slang for black people. But it seems black people have been using the term themselves as a way to take that back and own it. We have some pretty big racial issues if you couldn\u2019t tell.",

Hopefully they will reach a point where race isn\u2019t as relevant anymore, but they still have a long way to go.\n\nIt\u2019s not really comparable to terms like Anglo-German or Scottish-American because those identities don\u2019t play an active part in shaping people\u2019s lives. It\u2019s just a bit of trivia, really.",
            "Most people don't understand how incredibly bad American slavery was.\n\nThe owners regularly raped their female slaves, and when they had children, they would enslave their own children.\n\nThe reason there are so many light skinned African Americans is that almost all of them have white ancestors who raped their female ancestors.\n\nThomas Jefferson owned a slave named Sally Hemmings.  She was most likely his White wife's half sister [child of his father-in-law]\n\nJefferson and Hemmings had several children together.  All the kids were slaves.",

            "Hey OP, gonna paste something here in case you want a fully accurate response because there is a lot of partially correct info here and a whole shit ton of total garbage.\n\n___\n\nAfrican-American specifically refers to the diaspora of Black Americans brought over to this country as part of the slave trade. Because of this diaspora, their ancestral lineages have mostly been erased beyond knowing that their origins are largely African.\n\nWe also use terms like \"Irish American\" or \"Italian American\" and no one bats an eye, there aren't constant big Reddit threads about it, and no one thinks of those terms as being \"PC\". This is because it is simply identifying a heritage, and most people use those terms as a mark of pride and historical connection. \"African American\" is exactly the same, and the term actually stretches as far back as (IIRC) the 1800s, well before Rev. Jesse Jackson repopularized it, with one theory being that the term is intended to both link former slaves/their kids to their ancestry and make them feel connected to the country they now found themselves in.\n\nSo, no, \"black\" is not the same as \"African American\". Well-meaning people should learn the difference and not assume they are one and the same, and call Limeys \"African American\" because it is cringe and embarrassing. However, people should also understand that the effort to erase the term is perhaps nefarious, and that the phrase was crafted with legitimate meaning.\n\n_____",
            "Sounds weird to me, growing up in Africa there was nothing wrong with calling people black or white.\nThe more people can stop worrying about race, the quicker racism will reduce, the more we focus on it and highlight it the more of an issue it becomes.",
            "We are big into creating as many divisions as we can over here. Probably not the Wikipedia answer but that's my experience",
            "The term African American came out of the Back to Africa movement, which was a Black movement in the US that pushed for black Americans to reclaim their African ancestry. \n\nThat movement had some problems (tho I'm not saying it was bad overall). Two things: 1) Some people thought it erased black American culture. Black people had been living in America and had their own unique culture separate from Africa. 2) Black Americans aren't really African. It's like saying an American who's great grandparents were Irish is Irish-American. Someone of Irish descent might describe themselves that way, or just say \"I'm Irish\" when they mean Irish descent, but on a form they'd be called white, and American. \n\nAfrican American is an outdated and misleading name, but it's still the \"proper\" name for black Americans. It replaced the term \"Negro\", which used to be the formal way to refer to black people, though is considered today to be outdated at worst, and very insulting at best, though not as bad as the N word.",

            "Because of our history of racism, both at a personal level and systemic. \n\nThe African American experience (all minorities for that matter) is historically so far removed from the white American experience that you need a label to distinguish the difference. And while \"Americans who also happen to have more melanin in their skin\" is the more accurate descriptor, it's a bit of a mouthful.\n\nAs for why African Americans specifically? Yeah, that can be confusing but we do identify other ethnicities and their heritages by where people or their ancestors came from. WE comonly refer to whites as European Americans and to people of English ancestry as Anglo-Americans, we have Irish Americans, Scotch-Irish, Asian-Americans, Chineses-Americans, Japanese-Americans, Korean-Americans, Hispanics, Latinos, Mexican-Americans, Salvadoran-American, so on and so forth. They all mean something slightly different but generally, if you can place a specific country to a persons heritage, like Mexico or Korea, that tends to indicate that the person's family immigrated relatively recently, and are first, second or sometimes third generation immigrants (as a general rule of thumb). \n\nIf you use a broader term like Hispanic or Asian-American, that tends to indicate more of an outward appearance and they you don't know the precise family origin or that the ancestry may be a conglomerate of different cultures, for example someone with Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and European ancestry would likely just be called Asian-American.",

So people from South Africa, Nigerian, Jamaica, wherever will refer to their country of origin and add the American part, if they choose. \n\nBut again, because of racism, African Americans have to refer to themselves in the broad term \"African\" because we literally have no idea where we originate from. It's not like slaves had barcodes on them and records only referred to slaves the way one would speak of farm animals; completely ignored familial ties or country of origin.",

            "In general a disadvantaged minority will have whatever term is generally used to describe them by the majority used (or at least perceived to be used) in a derogatory fashion, leading to it being seen as an insult or slur. For example, people from your country have never really been the target of derision in the US, but Asians have, which is why I can call you a \"Brit\" (or a \"Scot\") all day long, but calling someone a \"Jap\" isn't acceptable. Two words that are derived from their literal meaning in exactly the same fashion, but usage has determined that one is offensive while the other is not.\n\nThis is why the popular/preferred term for people with African ancestry is currently \"African-American.\" When I was growing up (born in the 70s) it was the tail end of \"negro\" and moving into \"black.\"  If people are constantly doing shitty things to you while calling you by a word, you will eventually start to dislike that word. And every generation thinks they have decided on the term that is more reasonable and than that of the previous barbarians. \"No one will ever find a problem with this word, we figured it out!\" Hell, my grandparents' generation used \"colored,\" which was literally the most innocuous term possible, but even that isn't immune to hateful usage tainting it.\n\nAnd for most purposes they are just \"American\" until you need to distinguish between that particular sub-group and another, and not just (or even usually) in a hateful way. If I'm trying to make the point that one group of Americans is historically disadvantaged in some particular way I need language that conveys the people I'm talking about. If there's not a word to differentiate white and black people I would end up with nonsense sentences like \"Americans are four times more likely to be convicted of a crime against an American than an American would against an American.\"\n\nWhat are Britons whose ancestors were German called over there? I mean, ancestry obviously matters, as evidenced by the fact that the Royal Family changed their last name to disassociate themselves from the fact they have German heritage.

Our goals are still the same at the end of the day.\n\n\ud83d\udd3bThere are many Black people fortunate enough to grow up in their bubbles where they've never had to deal with any of the systemic bs, and probably prefer to just be labeled Americans.

Brown eyes got to go to lunch first, brown eyes got to go to recess first, brown eyes got extra cookies\u2026 It didn\u2019t take long for the children to recognize what physical trait was being used to divide them into a group of \u201cbetter\u201d and \u201clesser\u201d people. The kids started treating each other differently, even though the teacher never told them to and she never said that brown eyes were better.

Then a lot of people started calling themselves \"African American\" and petitioned that the government do the same, that one stuck around and is still less frequently used today. But then you get to the problem you described. A lot of Americans didn't want to be called \"African\" because they don't have any link to Africa. They're just Americans.

If I meet a black person outside of America and I ask them their nationality they're going to say I'm American. And I'm going to say to others, they're American. I'm not going to say they're African American because I'm referring to where they are from. I have no reason to state their race/ethnicity.\n\nIf I ask them their race they'll say black or African American (both would describe them accurately but the first is their race, the second is ethnicity, though they end up being used interchangeably).\n\nThen there is race vs. ethnicity.\n\nBlack = race\n\nAfrican American = ethnicity\n\nAmerican = nationality \n\nThe use of ethnicity vs nationality depends on context.\n\nThe use of black vs. African American is complicated due to what people find offensive, and the presence of black/african/african descended people in a the US who aren't American or don't want to be lumped in with that ethnicity.\n\nThis is done elsewhere and is even more complicated in other places lol. I'm Canadian. But I grew up in Trinidad and Tobago.\n\n Depending on where I am and what we're discussing, I can be called Trinbagonian (nationality), Trinidadian (nationality), African (race), Afro-trinidadian (race), West Indian (ethnicity), Afro-west Indian (ethnicity), afro-Caribbean (ethnicity), yada yada yada\n\nThere's another term we use for black/african that I can't recall right now but it means \"descended from Africans\". Likely we use it more when we want to differentiate from Africans from/in Africa but still call ourselves African.\n\nTrust me when I say that when people don't use the right terminology I get irritated even if I get how realistically I can't expect them to know. I guess it's mostly the overall ignorance toward our region than about them knowing the specifics. But all those terms have specific contexts in which they make sense.\n\nEthnicity can bind a number of people from the same country or region in a cultural sense that aren't necessarily the same race.\n\nE.g. African, Indians, Chinese, Spanish, Syrian, White people born in the West Indies, might call themselves in a specific context \"West Indian\". It's easier to do among other west Indians and in the west indian community, harder to use outside that context people only know \"caribbean\" which ethnically (and depending on what were talking about) is inaccurate.\n\nSo technically a white person from Africa could be African American. BUT the term has been used to describe a racial group within America with varying levels of accuracy.\n\nMy point is independent of who coined the term and why, it's largely a linguistic matter (a lot of our word groupings and labels are inaccurate), lack of knowledge,  further complicated by historical events and developments.\n\nThis is my humble opinion though. I'm happy to be enlightened.",

            "Pretty sure Denver a year or two ago partnered with the USDA to cull some of the geese population within the city and donate the meat to needy families. No one got sick so far as I know.",
            "One of the big things when asking \"is this animal safe to eat?\" is the liver, followed by the kidneys, if there's nothing obviously wrong on the exterior of the animal or with the meat. These organs are your big waste management centers of the body and often the first sign that something is wrong with the animal. If these two organs look healthy - they should, generally speaking, be a smooth, dark red (liver) to reddish-pinkish color (kidneys) - then you're good to go, just cook it properly, it's still wild game and doesn't get the typical deworming and vaccination management of farmed stock.\n\nDon't worry if you see the gallbladder, which is on the liver. It's normal, just don't pop it. You'll taint the meat and not even a dog would eat it with gallbladder nasty on it.\n\nExternal signs of an unhealthy animal are dull coat or feathers, and dull or sunken eyes. Abnormal gait or behavior is also a pretty obvious Do Not Eat Me sign, but if you're inexperienced a 'weird' acting animal may be perfectly normal for that species. Skinny critters are something that should also be avoided if possible (weight loss is often a sign of sickness), but it's not always apparent in thick feathered birds.\n\n*Angel wing* in birds (often seen in waterfowl fed too much bread) is *not* a danger sign. It's just that the bird has had a heavily unbalanced diet. You'll see this in birds were the flight feathers curl outwards from the body. They'd actually be easier to catch, seeing as they can't fly.\n\nTL;DR: Eat the goose, unless it's insides look funky.",

            "The short answer is yes, they'd be safe to eat.\n\nTo put it simply, geese are made out of 100% goose. Anything a goose eats is digested and either turned into more goose, or pooped out. It's doesn't matter if it's all junk food, it gets turned into goose. So long as they aren't eating poison, they should be fine. Look for a healthy goose, free of disease and infection. Always cook the meat completely to prevent the spread of any parasites. \n\nIn terms of butchering, you'd need to remove the giblets as soon as possible. If the digestive tract were to break open, it could taint the meat and possibly make you sick. This is also pretty much the reason why it's a bad idea to eat road kill.\n\nIf you're still interested, there are a lot of hunting and field dressing guides out there, many of which focus on water fowl.",

So, as an example, the wild ducks I hunt - we cook their breast meat to a medium/medium rare on the grill and it is delicious. The other parts of a duck would be tough if cooked this way. They can go in a slow cooker to help make the meat tender.",

            "In journalism the saying goes, \"If it bleeds, it leads.\"\n\nThe reason for this is controversy. The only thing that is INTERESTING is controversy and conflict. Plus, if you are going to use conflict to enrage people, it helps if you are mainly picking on a relatively small group of people, that way the folks you piss off aren't going to outnumber you.\n\nThere are a number of factors at play here:\n\n1. Gender dysphoria and gender identity are complex topics that the average person knows little about.\n2. The population is small, so many people don't personally know anyone going through gender dysphoria - so for many this is an abstract group to consider.\n3. Because gender dysphoria is complex, there are many unsettled questions regarding how to integrate trans people with the rest of society without inconveniencing society at large - take for example the debate about gendered sports. Athletes are also a small group, sports are gendered for either safety or competitive reasons, but even without trans people there is debate on whether or not these sports SHOULD be gendered. Adding trans people only further complicates that issue.\n4. Gender is something most people have internalized as subconsciously as they do language - and so they lack the experience of what it would be like to go through this experience. The closest most people can get are \"freaky Friday\" or \"Mrs. Doubtfire\" style movies, which don't come close to representing the reality.\n5. There are bad and crazy trans people just like there are in any group, but because its a smaller population, those bad and crazy ones are that much more noticeable. Plus, if someone is cross-dressing to hide their identity, or because they have some other mental health issue, they may wind up being represented as trans as well.\n6. It has all the same issues and stigmas related to homosexuality that society still hasn't gotten over yet.\n7. When people find topics confusing, they will be uncomfortable or even scared about how they can talk about this with their children. They worry that exposing a child to these ideas or knowledge might \"infect\" them with the same condition, etc. \n8. There is some blowback from trans advocacy aligning with the LGBTQIA+ movement, and that is that even allies will misrepresent the circumstances surrounding gender dysphoria. For example, the rhetoric that people can \"choose to identify however they wish,\" while altruistic is inherently problematic as it supports the claim that gender identity, sexual orientation, and sexual preferences are \"choices,\" rather than simply aspects about ourselves which we discover as we learn more about who we are. \n9. Also, conceptually, there is little utility in lumping in the concept of gender identity with sexual orientations and sexual preferences, as this actually makes the concept of gender identity less useful and more easily confused. This too is an outgrowth of the LGBTQIA+ movement; an unfortunate side-effect of the need to simplify messaging to promote greater awareness and acceptance of human sexuality as inherently non-binary. The fact is that if you can be trans and gay and aroused by wearing a cat costume, this only makes sense if gender identity and sexual orientation and sexual preferences are separate things. However, as that is a bit too nuanced to discuss for \"the masses,\" people take sides and a certain segment of allies will treat the suggestion of this being otherwise as \"transphobic\". \n10. Lastly, with each new generation of kids and teens, fads arise, and with this generation their fads are being influenced by the ability to use the Internet to \"self-diagnose\". This is a real issue [https://www.everydayhealth.com/emotional-health/young-people-are-using-tiktok-to-diagnose-themselves-with-serious-mental-health-disorders/](https://www.everydayhealth.com/emotional-health/young-people-are-using-tiktok-to-diagnose-themselves-with-serious-mental-health-disorders/) . The result is that there may be many that are claiming to be trans, who aren't trans, because they have self-diagnosed themselves based on information they have found online. So consider how this also impacts point 5 listed above, how it also impacts point 7, and you can see how there is some real conflict for people to engage with that has less to do with actual trans issues, and more to do with ignorant people being ignorant and feeling very passionate about something they don't actually understand.",

Are people who do that (invalidating experiences they don't understand) acting in an ethical way?  I don't think that's ethical. But how to be supportive is a difficult question too...how to be actively supportive of something we have difficulty understanding. \n\n Is curiosity about experiences that we don't understand a bad thing, does it place a mark of \"otherness\"? ...I suspect it does, and that why I don't talk about this topic in real life.

            "There's a correct answer, and you're not going to like it.\n\n1. A lot of trans people are chronically online. A LOT. It's easier for an trans girl to feel pretty when she does all her interacting from behind a stylized profile picture.\n\n2. Similarly, when you're online it's a lot easier to be brave/bold/confident in your views/whatever. Most trans people are pretty chill irl. But online... woo boy, y'all can get heated. This only leads to more anger and hatred, too, because the other side sees it as incongruous. There's a disconnect somewhere between \"I am sensitive about what people call me, so please call me by my preferred pronouns\" and \"if you refuse to do that, your entire family deserves to die.\" The combination of vulnerable+sensitive+outspoken is discomforting for people to interact with.\n\n3. Gender issues are uniquely universal, in that it's very easy to make ANYTHING about transgenderism. Any conversation with a trans person, that involves a trans person, or is about a trans person, immediately devolves into a flame war about pronouns. It's hard to stay on a different topic when half the messages back-and-forth are about correcting one another's language.\n\n4. It is the last great frontier of discrimination that is acceptable. The social movements that brought about gay rights and sexual liberation need something to put their energy towards, an innocent victim to fight for. And you're the last victim standing.",

Yes, politicians could stop using it but the damage is done, and honestly this isn't stemming from something new.   This is something that has been pushed into people for decades, so it's not going to just magiclaly disappear overnight.  People suck.  \n\nIn America, look at how long systemic racism is still rampant and outright racism is now more open.  The slaves were freed over 150 years ago and the black communities have been fighting for equality ever since.  The LGBT+ people have been around for a long time yes, but only really started making strides in the last 40 years.  You can watch a LOT of comedy and movies and shows from the mid-80s during the AIDS crisis to see how anti-LGBT+ things were just 40 years ago.  There is a massive population that thinks that it is wrong worldwide.  So in the past 40 years, there has been a LOT or progress made for the LGBT+ community in comparison to what the freed slaves had within 40 years.  \n\nLet's see if I can phrase the next bit correctly.  For the people that are against LGBT+, they feel it has been pushed down their throats from gay pride parades to changes inmedia, etc.  These people have been told that you can't make someone gay, even though some obviously believe it can happen.  So you have the group that are just idiots and believe that drag queen readings can make kids gay.  But for those that accepted that you ARE born gay, they're staring at the fact that men are now turning themselves into women, or vice versa.  To these people changing sex IS gay, and now you CAN be 'turned' gay.  These people that hate, are afraid, confused, whatever that isn't accepting LGBT+ are at their breaking point.  I'm not saying it's right, because it's not.  But people can only take so much change, so much damage to their perception of what is right and wrong in their reality before they snap and go full on rage boner.\n\ntl;dr; The LGBT+ community has made tremendous progress in the last \\~40 years compared to other marginalized communities, but with such rapid changes it is going to cause a LOT of friction to those that do not accept these changes.

            "There are few changes that a person can go through that other people are expected to accept and acknowledge every day from that point onwards.\n\n\nThis is a delicate topic, so let me talk about a different (comparatively small) change that someone can undergo.\n\n\nI don't like nose piercings. I think they look ugly. I don't like the thought of it. I wouldn't get one myself. \n\n\nPUT DOWN THE PITCH FORK.\n\n\nI have no issue with other people getting nose piercings. I think it's a ridiculous thing to get, but other people are free to do what they will. I have many friends, with many personalities. Naturally some of them have nose piercings \n\n\nIf (as has happened on occasion) a friend of mine takes the plunge and gets their first nose piercing. They are excited, by what I can only see as damage to their face. They will meet with me and they want to show off the nose piercing. They want others to be as excited about this as they are.\n\n\nBut just as I accept that they like nose piercings more than me, they accept the possibility that I might dislike this \"improvement\", so I am not forced to say \"Oh my god! That looks incredible\". All I have to do is acknowledge the piercing and give polite approval of them doing the thing that makes them happy. I do my best to say something that is nice without being a complete lie and then we never have to talk about it ever again.\n\n\nMy friend notes my acknowledgement and approval and that sentiment is assumed from every day there after without need to ever reaffirm the stance.\n\n\nSame goes for tattoos. Change of religion. Marriage. Alcohol. Drugs. Fashion. Politics. And basically any other change that a person can go through in life. You don't expect you friends to cheerlead every decision you make, after all, it wasn't their decision. It's enough for them to simply keep any criticism to themselves.\n\n\nWhen someone comes out as transgender, it is often not like this. You are expected to be over joyed by the news as if you have been excitedly awaiting this revaluation. A reaction that even most proposals and pregnancy announcements do not demand. We all accept that some people don't like marriage; some don't like babies and some don't like your husband. For most people, it is enough for you to be happy for them; they don't demand that you declare that you love weddings or that you were always hoping for this day.\n\n\nThe big announcement day asside. It also changes your future with the person in a way that few other things do. From now on every sentence addressing them informally or formally and in their presence or absence must be said differently. Every mention of them and every moment in their presence you must actively and clearly reaffirm your approval. When your friend gets married to that jack ass that you don't like, you aren't expected to exclusively refer to her as Mrs.Green from that point on. You can continue to use her first name.\n\n\nSo many cultural events and traditions have different roles for men and women, so there is also a need to publicly and loudly reaffirm your approval at each of these events. \n\n\nTalking about the past becomes difficult, because any acknowledgement of who they were before and what they were like can be taken as disapproval. In fact, you are often expected to pretend that they were obviously acted like their preferred gender in the past and that this change was inevitable to you from the very beginning. Even if THEY did not suspect at the time, you are all expected to pretend it was obvious. There's this story we have to tell where the person who eventually came out as trans was somehow blind to a million signs that were completely obvious to everyone. (And what does that say about us? Decades of knowing they were trans and refusing to broach the topic with them? In this fictional version of the past, the implication is that we really could have saved them some time if we weren't such timid jerks about the whole affair).\n\n\nIt also messes with the continuity of reminiscing in an unfortunate way. Often, when you try to reminisce there's a desire to comment on how nothing has changed. How you're the same band of misfits you always were, but since trans people tend to shed just about every aspect of their old personality attempts to reminisce with trans friends winds up ringing untrue or offensive. You become hyper aware of what may or may not lean towards gendering.\n\n\n\nThis comment got away from me a bit. I was really only trying to make the point that most things that people might talks about are brought up once and then sparingly there after. Once the decisions made, everyone involved is mature enough to pretend that we all approve and polite enough to never allow that assumption to be questioned. When someone is trans it changes everything and is brought forever there after.\n\n\n\nIt shouldn't be surprising that it garners some discussion.",

Protests and legislation formalized the legality, but *making the issue a topic of conversation* changed the culture, and now we barely notice it.\n\nHomosexuality was another such issue. A small segment of the population was being systematically hunted, discriminated against, and in some cases subjected to involuntary medical abuse. Even in Canada (where I am) change in this regard came embarrassingly late.

It's simply a \"good to know so I can now refer to your spouse correctly\".\n\nI don't fall into any recognized minority group, but I want to stand as an ally to anyone who is being treated unfairly. \n\nTrans people: if being your vocal ally is not what you want from me, please help me understand what to do to best help curb discrimination toward you.

Some people see it as totally ok and people should be able to get them at will, others think it's equivalent to a sexual lobotomy for anyone to use hormones, and still others think it's something that should be exclusively used only by adults and under the medical supervision of a doctor.\n\nThis debate is complicated by the profit margins of the medical industrial complex, who stand to make a couple million dollars per person on surgeries and thousands of dollars per year for hormone treatments and prescriptions for the remaining lifetime of the patient. So there's a massive industry pushing to turn transitioning into insulin/diabetes 2.0, which has a lot of people concerned due to how the medical industrial complex has handled insulin and how the military industrial complex has handled recruitment.\n\nJust pointing out, the regions of the country, political party, and general population most on guard regarding the trans topic and indoctrination are also the most likely to be diabetic due to obesity and have historically been the biggest supporters of the military. \n\nSo even without the religious angle, they've got plenty of reason to say, \"If it walks like a duck...\"\n\nOn a small-scale individual level?

People didn't care before, or rather they didn't care because you were already osthraziced and so there was no point in caring about you, as that was what was assumed normal - but you don't get change by \"nobody caring\", you get change by getting people to care and having visibility on your lives and wanting to be accepted.\n\nBut visibility means you get people to talk more about you, and that means you will have everyone that supports you and everyone who doesn't, and many important figures know this too. There will be those who support you and try to show their support so you are more accepted, and there will be those who don't and will use that hate to rally people towards their cause of discrimination. A ton of people who will be rather neutral in regards to it but will want the support of whatever group is closer to their values. We saw that happen many times before in history, and you can see it recently with gay rights movements, abortion laws, etc.\n\nThe problem is, and this sucks to say, \"Trans\" is the more far out there Zone of the LGBT+ community. You need to go in a journey of literally changing your body to transition, to change your legal sex, to change the way people refer to you. This makes it harder to accept for most people, even in the LGBT+ community you will find people who don't accept you as a result, and so you are a more \"polarizing topic\" currently than gays are in the current enviroment (not saying they are perfectly accepted, but not as bad as before).\n\nAnd as an extra, whenever a polarizing topic arises, it's common it flows into other forms. As an example, you get a celebrity talk about trans, then randomly another celebrity either shows support or disgust, this keeps the \"topic\" alive for longer.",

            "This reminds me of a conversation I had at work. Someone suggested turning on Closed Caption on our videos by default because they want to be \"inclusive\".  I asked them how many people are hard of hearing at our company?  They said a very small number.\n\nI then asked why would you make 99% of the people have to click an extra button to turn off CC when the <1% can just turn it on themselves?\n\nI'm not sure what they ended up doing.  The point is, as long as these minority groups have a way to access the resources they need, it doesn't make sense for us to overdo it and inconvenient the majority of the people.",

            "My guess is that overall, it is because  people are resistant to change. If you have a way of life that is comfortable to you, wouldn't you oppose anything that would force you to change your way of life so that the life you were living was no longer the life you wanted to live? \n\nLeaving religion out of it.\n\nLet's say that life is like the one I had. From, childhood there were only boys and girls. And gvien that I had only seen and been familiar with male/female relationships, that was the standard for normalcy. That's the world I was comfortable to live in.\n\nThen someone comes along and says that males with males and females with females should be normal, too. But that goes against what I had grown up to believe which in turn, it makes sense that I would be opposed to it. But I am willing to let those people live their lives as long as I can live mine.\n\nNow go to another level, trans, and that is at a greater distance from the place where I would call \"Ground Normal\" and it seems that \"the real world\" is fading away which would be fine if it could be viewed as an improvement. I would theorize that most people do not see \"trans\" as being an improvement over just boy or girl.  \n\nI think that it is a strange thing on this platform that being \"trans\" is supposed to be normal (at least according to the moderators) but being (my version of) normal (boy or girl) is supposed to be abnormal. It's like saying that you are Christian means that you are anti Jewish, Muslim Hindu, etc.\n\nBut that is the online world were living in.",

            "Respectfully, I think much of the answer lies in the fact that ten or twenty years ago that .5% figure you cited was probably considered a incredibly tiny fraction of that. My hypothesis: If there\u2019s that big of jump that fast, along with the so much fanfare for the movement in media these days when nobody talked about it before pretty much at all, people who don\u2019t identify will start to take notice and wonder why. Since it seems to me as an outsider that much of the coverage seems to be how quickly it\u2019s catching on with children in particular, which invites all sorts of controversy vs if it was just adults transitioning. The trans community may seem easily outraged to most, but I would submit that they\u2019re generally as \u201cloud\u201d as any group, but they are very much new to the groups who are outraged at things, which makes hearing their new perspectives more jarring than hearing from a group that\u2019s been represented for much longer. I\u2019m not making any judgements on whether the message is right or wrong, but that\u2019s my hypothesis of some of the primary reasons most people who aren\u2019t happy with the proliferation (the primary being of course people fear/hate things they don\u2019t understand) of the trans movement.",

All these things are concrete and merit immediate and thoughtful action which neither party seems to want to tackle and if they did would bring fundamental and lasting change in this country. Instead the only discussion around gender rights right now seems to be about a tiny group of people. We are all being duped as voters by this.

Wasn\u2019t big on living room. Until I lived alone. Bought a big TV, got a coffee table. And that became my entertainment center.

            "Once so far... very weird only happened once in my 34 years. Not a feeling I enjoyed",
            "Yes, everytime i sit on the edge of couches and lean forward for long periods of time",
            "No I didn't even know it was possible to do that",
            "Nope",
            "Yes, mostly when i ride a bike or I'm sitting in something hard",
            "If you sit on just below where the spine connects to the tail bone, then yes. Although this takes a while",
            "If I sit on a hard surface half-assed and lean forward for more than a few minutes.",
            "Seek medical attention.",
            "Yeah, actually.  Sometimes when I\u2019ve got my legs crossed it\u2019ll randomly go numb.  It\u2019s very strange.",
            "Yes.",
            "Been bicycling?",
            "I caught an std one time, and it feels exactly how you are describing it. Except I would drip pee once in a while.",
            "Did it ever wake up?",
            "Yep and my nuts. From sitting on a high rise  chair.",
            "Mine has before! I say mainly in my left cheek, it fell sleep, and so did my penis.\n\nNot gonna lie, I got a little experimental, and I started to pleasure myself while it was asleep. I call it the sleeping turtle",
            "Have you tried turning it off and on?",
            "Yes! Happens sometimes if I sit on the ground with my knees up.",
            "Why would you even ask that lmfao",
            "Yep",
            "I've had it happen on the toilet before, everything from the base of my dingus all the way to the toes kn my left leg went numb",
            "Yes.. Long trip on a motorcycle. A little freaked out when I stopped to get gas a stretch my legs.",
            "It depends how you sit and how long it is. OP clearly has a massive shlong. You can't cut off the circulation otherwise because thighs alone are too soft to cause it whereas they can converge to decrease the space further down. However, it is only further down that the legs can actually hold something, let alone strangle it. This guy is humbly bragging about his 18\" Dick Rambone.",
            "Absolutely.",
            "no but on the topic of penises, is it normal to be able to feel your pulse through your dick",
            "Yeah, but I'm not sure it's the penis that falls asleep, but more the connecting tissue, meaning the cockbone-less area sometimes referred to as the 'perineum'. I believe I have experienced perineal  asleepness during prolonged periods of sitting in one place.",
            "Only when I trip over it.",
            "Yes. Sometimes when I sit on my bike in a particular way for extended periods of time my penis seems to just vanish. Doesn't happened often, maybe once every 4 or 5 months. I think it is just the perfect storm of the seam on my shorts pressing in just the wrong spot and my positioning just being off that day. \n\nThe first time it happened I freaked the hell out since it lasted for quite a long time. Legitimately just felt like a stranger's penis when jangling it around.",
            "Same",
            "It's called Erectile dysfunction",
            "Is it possible to learn this power",
            "Yes from riding a motorcycle for 3 hours nonstop. Next day when wanking it was like touching another man\u2019s peepee",
            "Not my penis, but my left nut has this problem quite often.",
            "Yes, during sex. I can\u2019t recall if any substances were involved (likely) but there came a point where there was no sensation and I could go full jackhammer without feeling a thing",
            "Wtf",
            "I sat on a bike seat too long and my gooch went numb. (I'm a guy)",
            "My nutsack has",
            "No but my left ball does (when my whole leg does) lol",
            "It has happened to me riding my motorcycle. Since it vibrates a lot being a single cylinder it sometimes gets numb and when you stand up or just lift your ass a little from the seat the tingling sensation comes",
            "#NO",
            "lol!\ud83d\ude02",
            "This happened to me in my high school English class. I was mind blown and scared, I wasn\u2019t sure what was happening. It seemed to happen because I was siting with too much pressure on my taint area.",
            "Wtf does this even mean...",
            "My vagina did that. Twice.\n\nIt's a very weird feeling.",
            "Yes, when i'm playing video games, sitting on a weird couch-chair i have",
            "Yes on longer trips on a motorcycle. Felt flat in front like Ken for like twenty minutes.",
            "Very common symptom for cyclists",
            "Uhhh... No, go to the hospital asap.",
            "This happens to me when I'm sitting somewhere with not great back support. Or when there's no cushion under me.",
            "You should see a doctor if this happens more than once.",
            "Bicycling will do this to me sometimes.",
            "Definitly by using a bicycle for a long time...",
            "Yes if I'm sitting in an awkward position for a long long time",
            "I heard bike riders have this sometimes. I never experienced it though.",
            "Yes, after a long boxing session...if you know what I mean.",
            "No, you're gripping it too tightly. Stop strangling your Jimmy.",
            "No",
            "Everytime I'm on a bike, or weirdly a drum throne it happens.",
            "No",
            "Yes. But only when I slouch on the tram chair. I then have a tingly couple of minutes walking to work.......",
            "Occasionally, only if,you beat it REALLY HARD and long",
            "...How did that happen? That doesn't sound healthy, do you eat well?",
            "No",
            "Yes this has happened to me before. In fact I can feel it starting now. It happens when I sit on concrete with my back on a wall and my legs bent up at ~90\u00b0. My legs fall asleep then kinda moves inwards. Its very weird and strangely arousing. Goes away when I stand up and start moving.",
            "The Stranger",
            "Yes",
            "I have really bad circulation so yes it's happened, but I think what's worse is when you fall asleep accidentally pinching the vein on your temple. It feels like part of your brain is numb and the tingling creeps down your arm and back.",
            "I once decided not to buy something online because a man mentioned in the reviews that it made his penis fall asleep.",
            "Well whiskey does that to a man sometimes....",
            "Same",
            "I diagnose you with dead",
            "Yes!!!",
            "It happens with cycling, if you're in the saddle too long you can restrict blood flow around the perineum and your penis and balls can go numb.",
            "Kinda, sorta. Scary shit. \n\nI used to have a bike seat that was super padded, but apparently pressed pretty hard on the nerve at the base of my dong (pretty much between the bag of cherries and the back door). I didn't really notice, but that area got kinda tingly over the summer and by the time I met a girl I couldn't perform all that great. Took a few weeks to get back to normal. \n\nApparently it's pretty common for long distance cyclists, but my shitty ass seat caused it in like 2x15 minute rides a day.",
            "Yes I've had it happen only twice while sitting on the edge of a coffee table, there must be a nerve up there in the Gooch somewhere. Really strange feeling.",
            "Finally I can come out of hiding and admit this has happened to me. My secret shame is no longer secret.",
            "First time ever just yesterday. I was biking, and not sure what happened or what but when I stood up... well, it was the strangest feeling ever. Don't want that shit to happen again.",
            "Yeah",
            "Only once (that I remember)... it's a weird feeling to have in my penis to say the least.\n\nThankfully no pins and needles afterwards, cause that'd be fucked.",
            "Sorry to tell you, but ur peepee will fall off soon",
            "Yeah, happens quite a lot when I am cycling",
            "It's called flaccid.",
            "Not really, but sometimes if my leg falls asleep my (that side) testicle also does",
            "You were probably sitting or lying in a way that it cut off circulation to it",
            "Bad blood circulation. I really think you dont want that problem in the dickal area.",
            "Sometimes one of my nuts will fall asleep... I've never met anyone else that's experienced it.",
            "Yes",
            "I like to sit on mine til it goes to sleep, then knock one out and it feels like I'm jerking someone else..."
