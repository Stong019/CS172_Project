            "What is Elf on a Shelf? Outside of being an elf that is currently on a shelf.",
            "I fight against it because Snitches get Stitches",
            "Not sure if is an official rule but we told my kid she couldn't touch it or it would lose its magic. We hid that little bastard starting Dec. 1st for 4 years. Many times it was waking up at 5am with a gasp \"WE FORGOT THE FUCKING ELF!!\". This year though after being told multiple times to leave it alone she tried moving it without directly touching it and it fell on her face. The curse was lifted. We are free",
            "Feel like people fall in two camps on this stuff:\n\nYou either love the magic behind it for those who believe or you feel like it\u2019s another example of commercialization that we\u2019ve fallen for.",
            "Not gonna lie, I thought you were talking about the \"you've heard of Elf On A Shelf, now get ready for...\" memes.",
            "I don't think there's anything objectively wrong with it, but as somebody old enough that 2005 feels fairly recent, it feels obnoxiously artificial. Like, it's not a holiday tradition, somebody just started selling elves one year and declared it to be a tradition, and a bunch of people apparently fell for it.",
            "OBEY THE PANOPTICON OR ELSE",
            "My kids specifically asked not to get one. They thought it was creepy.",
            "I don't like it because I don't like the idea of teaching children that the only reasons to be good are to be rewarded and to avoid punishment. We should be teaching them to be good because it's the right thing to do.",
            "As a toy for the whole family to play with, a dynamic Christmas decoration, I have no problem with that at all.  Telling kids that it's alive and spying on them is creepy and terrible.",
            "There are two different ways to do it. I just learned this this year. \n\nOne elf on the shelf is just a fun game where the parents just move the elf around the house and put it in new and fun spots and positions. I have no problem with this version. \n\nThe other version is that the elf is a spy for Santa and reports on the kids behavior. This I find to be a fucked up babys first NSA type thing. I hate it so much and it genuinely creeps out my kid and I had to talk her down from it after she got exposed to this crap in school. Dear parents that do this crap, grow a pair and make punishments and threats yourself and stop using supernatural bullshit.",
            "Fucking hate it, always have, always will. It\u2019s so stupid for it to \u201cwatch over kids to make sure they are not naughty\u201d while every night doing naughty things and being moved around. Dumb, dumb, dumb! There will never be a creepy fucking elf in my house.",
            "Very much so.  \n\nBut admittedly, that may be because I only learned about this a year ago (I'm in my 40s) so maybe it's just \"too new\".  I spent a bunch of years overseas, and when I came back to the US, suddenly it was this big \"thing\".   How long has it been a \"thing\", and where the hell did it originate?  \n\nRegardless, I still think it's weird as hell...it's like conditioning people to being spied on.",
            "I've always been somewhat uncomfortable with the whole Santa Claus lie, but went along with it since it has been going on since forever. I think it's _really_ weird that my generation of parents made up a whole new holiday lie.",
            "You can call it weird, but to the kids at my place they call it fun. They look forward to it every time they come home. The story goes the Elf reports what he sees to Santa so kids have to behave. \n\nEven if that part isn't always working as intended, they will have fun memories looking for the elf. Its a harmless game so I see no problem.\n\nEdit: some of yall talk as if you've never seen the eyes of a child light up brighter than christmas deco. Actually observe them to find out if something makes them uncomfortable before assuming you know.",
            "Dutch person here\n\nIt seems like something that parents use to terrify kids into being good (similar vain as coal in shoe, or hoe Zwarte Piet would take kids away, or Krampus) and it gets a \"pass!\" Nowadays for nostalgia and looking \"cute\"\n\n\nBut its an ugly old doll\n\n\nIt's weird",

            "yes this naughty elf shit is weird as fuck. Im avoiding it in my house but my kids school and daycare do it and its just not for me. I have 2 naughty elves as it is XD",
            "yes I do think it\u2019s weird and I do think it is encouraging children to be okay with their behavior being surveilled. i do understand that that is not a new concept to this world, as it\u2019s been a thing with Santa as well as many peoples\u2019 & churches\u2019 interpretations of God throughout the years as well. I happen to also think those things are weird. I have never been a fan of the santa story and the idea of conditioning children to believe that their behavior is being monitored. It\u2019s ethically squicky from my POV to train kids that it\u2019s normal to hypervigilantly avoid \u201cbeing bad\u201d to avoid punishment. Super carceral and I don\u2019t like it. Even in my own personal system of faith which includes the omnipotent presence of God, I do not believe that we\u2019re being actively monitored and having a tally made up of all of our good vs bad thoughts/beliefs/decisions/actions/etc that will be held against us on our death day.\n\ntldr: The whole idea around it is bizarre to me and that extends to other things that take on the same concept including Santa and Prison-warden-God. edits for typos",
            "We bought one and my kids roundly rejected it. They were 8, 6 and 2 at the time. The Elf went missing and they told me later they buried in the trash! So it got thrown away. His name was Shmelfy.",
            "If you think that's weird look up what we're doing in Easter in Czechia - \"[easter whip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_whip?wprov=sfti1)\".",
            "This elf crap wasn't funny when it first came out and every year half my friends are \"hilariously\" posting this toy in various places. I've actually started muting them for 30 days on Facebook. About as funny as those animal filter things, which also aren't funny. Honest to god you have to be seriously lacking to find such banal shit funny.",
            "Yes",
            "This wasn\u2019t around when I was a kid. Took me awhile to figure out what the deal is. Yeah I think it\u2019s pretty weird too. Up there with gender reveals.",
            "In our house we do \"Whore in the Drawer\" which is a Barbie doll in slutty torn up clothes with a bunch of trashy tattoos drawn on and bad jersey shore makeup. One of them has a NJ outline on her calf with a star where her hometown is, and the other has a custom g-string.\n\n\nWe get each other by hiding the whore in various drawers, there's not really anything else to it though, this elf in the shelf shit is weird as hell.",
            "Yeah I find it weird. It's marketed as a \"tradition,\" but it came out in 2005. That's why too new for me to consider it nostalgic (I was already 25) so it felt like someone just created a whole new Christmas tradition and I have to go along with it.\n\nWhen I first heard about it, and how everyone acted as if it had always been a thing, I felt like I had stepped into a different world (thank you Truck-Kun, but next time Isekai my ass somewhere with magic and some sweet powers, not my same world with a creepy elf).",
            "I think so. I don\u2019t like the \u201csomeone\u2019s always watching\u201d vibe it\u2019s got going on.",
            "Not any weirder than Santa \u201che knows when you are sleeping. He knows when you\u2019re awake. He knows when you\u2019ve been bad or good\u201d. \n\nChristmas has always been weird.",
            "Na I think its fun. All about how you do it. With my nephew the last few years he's enjoyed it. We don't do it as a \"He's always watching you so be nice\" type thing, we just have him move around and show up in different parts of the house doing silly stuff. Yesterday we had him set up in a knocked over pretzel jar on my counter along with a bag full of Hershey kisses dumped out with wrappers on the floor lol. When my nephew woke up and saw that he got a pretty good laugh about it.",
            "I\u2019ve always found it creepy, I don\u2019t believe in making kids thinking inert objects are alive.",
            "I think all Christmas stuff is weird as hell and materialistic. Most toxic part of it is being looked down upon if you don't want to buy gifts. Not to mention people having to work extra hours so others can get their precious objects.",
            "It\u2019s creepy, stupid, and weird. Threatening your child to be good and these elves come and sit in your house and watch you and report it back to Santa but they only move at night and get into mischief. So the elves can be naughty but the children can\u2019t? Make it make sense. I hate elf on the shelf and I have two young children. Won\u2019t do it. It\u2019s stressful for mom and I personally feel that it isn\u2019t really believable bc they\u2019re a sack of red felt with a Barbie doll head\u2026",
            "Yup. Ain\u2019t doing it with our daughter. People feistily tell us we need one.",
            "I think you can have Christmas magic and traditions without the elf on the shelf. All I hear are parents complaining about having to move the elf.",
            "To each their own. I think it\u2019s ridiculous.",
            "Its creepy and perverted IMO. Idk why i feel that way. I just do. Them little elves stress me out and creep me out",
            "I just thought it was a creepy fucking elf decoration until my fiance informed me that thing is supposed to tell Santa if a kid is being bad. That just makes it worse. I told her that if we ever have kids we weren't going to have it in our house because being creepy is bad enough, but there's no need to make the kids paranoid too.",
            "It's weird. Some parents traumatized the heck out of their kids with it. Making them feel like every mistake of theirs is being watched and criticized. It's gross.",
            "If you think that training kids to live in a surveillance culture is cute and Christmasy there's nothing wrong with it at all.",
            "Yes, but I also think Santa is. \"He sees you when your sleeping\" How does that sound okay? If it weren't a super popular thing, and you seen a blog post on it explaining everything about it in great detail, would you think it was normal? Probably not. They both sound like they are spying on you 24/7. Forcing a kid to behave good doesn't make them actually behave. Anyways, I'm a teenager who never had anything to do with Santa so that's my take! :)",
            "What's weird about normalizing supernatural surveillance to facilitate fear of stepping out of line?",
            "It wasn't a thing for my childhood (thankfully) but I've always interpreted it as getting our culture ready and used to mass surveillance. You never know where the camera is going to be and god help you if you try to sabotage it.",
            "Aww yiss my favorite Christmastime topic. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nElf on a shelf is weird as fuck and one professor thinks it's training kids to accept living in a police state. [https://policyalternatives.ca/publications/commentary/whos-boss](https://policyalternatives.ca/publications/commentary/whos-boss)\n\n\"While the elf may be part of a pre-Christmas game and might help manage   \nchildren\u2019s behaviors in the weeks leading up to the holiday, it also   \nsets children up for dangerous, uncritical acceptance of power   \nstructures. Certainly, teachers and parents can incorporate critical   \npedagogies alongside the elf\u2019s presence in children\u2019s play worlds and   \nsocial lives in \u201cteachable moments\u201d that cultivate children\u2019s ability to  \n identify, question, and resist power. How do children conceptualize   \nbeing watched; do they perceive themselves to be engaging in   \nperformance, or is performativity a natural response to the elf\u2019s   \npresence.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSee also: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2014/12/16/the-elf-on-the-shelf-is-preparing-your-child-to-live-in-a-future-police-state-professor-says/",
            "When we were pregnant with our daughter I made it very clear to all of our family that no one was to buy us an elf on the shelf. I will not do that shit. I already feel dubious about Santa (the whole lying to your kid about a fat man magically bringing gifts), so adding in a complicating factor to the lie makes me very uncomfortable. Also, that\u2019s just a fuckton more work for me in an already stressful time of year. \n\nI want the magic of Christmas for my kid, I just don\u2019t look forward to the day I have to explain that Santa isn\u2019t real and I\u2019ve been lying to her for years.",
            "Yeah, it's super creepy. The parents who are really in to it, in my experience, are super domineering and controlling.\n\n\n\"This elf watches you all the time and sees everything you do\" isn't fun, it's creepy. Couple that with the new \"fake elf surveillance camera\" and you're just teaching your kid police states are a good thing and result in presents.\n\n\nIt's gross. Plus, his dead little eyes skeeve me the fuck out.",
            "I prefer skipping the metaphor, lecturing my children about Bentham\u2019s panopticon and then moving straight into the theory of the carceral.",
            "I never understood it until someone told me it was a thing devised by advertisers so you'd have a bunch of Elf on the Shelf crap to buy every year.",
            "Yes, that wasn\u2019t a thing when I was young but I can easily imagine my 6-year old self having an absolute meltdown over the thought of being surveilled by some nasty little snitch planted by my own mother. \n\nI do not understand this concept of making Christmas a holiday about obedience and accountability. For me, Christmas was always more about making crafts, decorating cookies, going to local holiday events, seeing Santa at the mall, ABC 25 days of Christmas on tv, tree decorating, stuff like that. My mom was never like \u201cHappy holidays, judgement day is nigh. Time for Santa and his morality elves to reflect on your yearly wrongdoings\u201d\u2026that just was not a part of it lol. The lump of coal thing was the only \u201cbad\u201d thing ever mentioned and even that was obviously just a joke. \n\nI think it\u2019s kind of sick to let any child believe that there is a possibility that they would be deemed unworthy of a Christmas gift, and let that threat play a role in their decision making skills. Talk about negative reinforcement\u2026jeez",
            "Yes, its weird. But I guess its fun for the kids.",
            "Not a fan-they give me the creeps!!",
            "As a transformers fan, I do \"Prime on a dime\"",
            "It is weird as fuck. But it\u2019s also dangerous. \n\nThe Elf on the Shelf teaches kids to regulate their behavior out of fear of authority. Not to internalize their good behavior and be good for goodness sake.",
            "In Canada we have goose on a moose. \n\nNo lie.",
            "Never understood the appeal of it. Some people are more easily entertained than others I suppose",
            "I have one and my kids didn\u2019t fall for it but that\u2019s probably bc I hate lying to them. The jig is up on just about all the imaginary religious groups and their many weird holidays.",
            "There's long parental tradition all over the world of farming out custodial vigilance.  Just tell kids that if they're bad, some supernatural agent will see and punish them.\n\nIt's creepy as hell.  In the Mother Goose rhyme, Wee Willie Winkie is looking in their bedroom windows at night to see if they're sleeping like they should be.  That's basically the same energy.  \n\nSo it's normal, but it's pure high-octane messed-up.  Elf on the Shelf is just Krampus commercialized downward.",
            "My child recently requested one and I had to explain that an elf on the shelf\u2019s roll is to watch you all year round and report back to Santa on your actions. And asked if she really did want that\u2026 to which she replied\u2026 hmmm nope I\u2019m good. Lol\n\n I find that it teaches surveillance is acceptable at all times and that they shouldn\u2019t be allowed privacy in their own homes. It\u2019s definitely disturbing to me.\n\nThere are plenty of other holiday traditions that we keep for the magic and fun of it that doesn\u2019t require an underlying acceptance of fascism.",
            "It totally creeps me out. Hadn't heard of it till recently. Are we trying to condition our kids to be okay with being watched? \n\nGiven the way tech is going, they aren't going to have much choice. Esp if you consider the weird social credit systems creeping in.... :(",
            "Not as weird as any other Christmas tradition, although this is definitely a newer one as it's barely 7 years old and clearly designed from day 1 to be a toy campign.\n\nWith that said, my sister in law told my wife and I to Not start that tradition as she regretted it. Every year for 24 days leading up to Christmas (we're Canadian so we ain't doing Oct 10th to Dec 24th) she had to find something different for the elf to \"do\" and she started that when my nephew was 5 and my neice was 3. Now over the years  thats 100 different places to \"hide\" for that elf to do, because my nephew or my niece remembers what he did in previous years.\n\nFurthermore, apperantly the kids can't touch the elf or it will loose its \"magic\" and resemble a toy (apperantly to explain why the elf doesn't do anything if the kids approach it.) one year this caused my nephew great distress as my niece unknowingly touched the dolls arm and caused it to fall over. He was crying and crying that my niece essentially killed it. My sister in law had him appear the next day with a cast around his arm.\n\nHonestly, I don't think it's a good Christmas tradition as it doesn't encourage anything other than believing in the elf itself. Imean maybe it encourages kids to be good as it reinforces the idea of Santa \"watching them\". But it focuses so much on the elf itself that it's hard to say. Either way, leaving a half eaten tray of cookies and milk does the same thing.\n\nAlso there's this https://youtube.com/shorts/A-ozCukX92s?feature=share\n\nSo enjoy!",
            "I hate that stupid elf so much. My wife brought one home when my daughter was a baby, and for a year or two did all the crazy shit everyone else was doing (which my kid wouldn\u2019t remember). Now she\u2019s a few years older and it\u2019s just a chore. I get up to pee at 4am and oh shit we didn\u2019t move the elf, I guess I\u2019ll put it over there. My daughter gets upset when it\u2019s time for the elf to go back home after Xmas, and I\u2019m really looking forward to the next year or so when she figures out it\u2019s all a lie. Should\u2019ve said no from day one, but got shamed into thinking I was a bad parent because everyone else was doing it. \n\nSo parents of young ones, don\u2019t fall for it. Your kid doesn\u2019t need this to enjoy the season.",
            "Its fun as hell, I get to watch my sleep head children look for the elf. Christmas magic is real if you make it so!",

            "Agreed. And here I thought it was just an elf that you put on a shelf to \u201cwatch\u201d your kids so that they be good. I hadn\u2019t heard that parents hide it each night, and kids aren\u2019t supposed to touch it or something.  Sounds really annoying to have to deal with.",

But if we did I don't think it would be weird.\n\nOn all the parenting subreddits people are freaking out about the elf. Is Christmas not already ridiculous and commercialized? Is the elf really the thing that tips the scale? Cuz Santa is shady af and the elf seems like a fun game. You also don't need to buy one, you can use literally any object. And you don't need to tell you're kids it's spying on them.\n\nAgain, it's as weird as people make it.",

I bought my first bunch of bananas since receiving the hanger the other day, and I'm down to 2 out of the original bunch of 6 bananas. I went to have a banana with breakfast this morning, but kind of stopped when I realized that would leave me with only one banana left. How would I leave this last banana on the hanger once I break apart these last 2 of the bunch? Should I try to break the stem on the one I'm about to eat particularly low and hope that it leaves enough of a little \"\u039b\" on the remaining banana's stem so that it can still hang? Should I just lean the remaining banana against the back bamboo support arch on the hanger and just totally ignore the hook? Or maybe try to stab the hook through the stem on the last banana? I'm not at all sure what the protocol is on a situation like this, totally new to the banana hanger owner world. ",

            "First problem that comes to my mind would be that the nation has no transportation infrastructure issues, 50 states do.  So now instead of your one solution of hire these guys to fix the roads you need 50 different plans that work with each states legal and economic nuances.  Next you would actually need to have these programs pass which is difficult because the majority of people in some of these states will argue every point into the ground.  Even if you were able to get through the red tape to use money to give people some jobs and to put money back into infrastructure, good luck doing it in time to help anyone.  And those are just a couple basic issues of essentially getting anything done in the US.\n\nEdit: Cause this got a little popular I just want to say this is an incredibly basic path of American government.  To those hating on the bureaucracy I understand your frustration but I believe this system works when people want it to.  These issues are vetted by everyone at all levels, people play devils advocate with new policies because they can easily do more harm then good.  Our system used to function when someone was able to present an idea and people listened.  Others pointed out flaws that were defended and people changed their minds when they saw the benefits.  That is rarely the case anymore and anyone who actually leads is accosted by everyone else.  Imagine any president ,does not matter if trump, Biden, Bernie, or any of our leaders tried to enact what FDR did back in the day.  They would be denounced as a tyrant by half the country the next day.",
            "The Works-Progress Administration did this very thing in the 1930s and into the 40s. They built roads, bridges, schools, hospitals and all kinds of public infrastructure. It was part of The New Deal under Roosevelt - which should tell you everything you need to know about how successful it was (very) and how much chance there is of having a program like that happen now (zero.)\n\nPeople were smart, practical and willing to work not only for themselves, but for the good of the country - both at the public level and at the government level. Too many people would never do it, too many politicians would never pass it, too many taxpayers would never agree to pay for it and too many corporations would never allow the government to directly contract projects they feel would prohibit profit.\n\nWe've become far too selfish, divided and anti-government to ever do something like this again, no matter how good an idea it would be.",

It's skilled, sometimes highly skilled labor. There is a reason we go through a minimum 4 year apprenticeship. Even after that, your not exactly skilled labor.... you just might not be a total loss for the company that hires you. \n So, we start a program that teaches people to build roads and highways ( thats something that already exists but I'll humor you), your a minimum of 4 years out right there. You next take this mass of people with a minimal skill set and have them go out and fix the roads, your going to get rough quality for the next 5 years at least. Nine years later you have a skilled workforce building roads.... but I'm not going to take my skill set that I have built over 20 years and sell it for 1/3 of what I make now. Most of us who do it for a living now, won't.\n  I could go on and on but thats the very basics, from a labor standpoint, as to why we can't just pay random people 15 bucks an hour to fix everything.

And even if you made a law that would somehow shorten these times by a lot, by the time that law was passed and you have even started the massive project of hiring and training workers, the economy would probably be on the uptake again and you wouldn't have that many people that are even able to do any sort of serious roadwork to hire left, because of course those would probably also be the people that find work more easily anyway. Also you need qualified personal to lead those workers you hire and that will be in short supply and again, can't be trained that easily in the short term.\n\nI think we would need to see a lot deeper crisis like the Great Depression before something like this would be entertained again.\n\nAnd that is besides a myriad of other issues that would keep that from ever happening.",

            "Government doesn't directly hire people to fix roads and bridges and so on. They hire companies to do it, and those companies  bring in the architects, soil engineers, welders, excavator operators, flaggers, and the myriad other workers they need to accomplish the task. Most of those people are skilled, already trained, and already vetted by the companies.\n\nIf your county just bought trucks, backhoes, welding machines, generators, a bunch of steel in various sizes, and say an [asphalt paving machine](https://www.equipmenttrader.com/Construction-Equipment/listing/2002-CATERPILLAR-AP-1050B-5007106204), and said \"sign up here if you want to help build roads at $15/hour\", you can predict what you'd get:\n\n* broken equipment\n* dead and injured workers\n* lawsuits from the workers and the owners of property they destroy\n* **no bridges**\n* **no roads**\n\nWhat you are really proposing is to expand the number and value of infrastructure contracts, while at the same time directing the companies that do that work to hire trainees from among the pool of unemployed that you're trying to help. That includes store clerks, pencil pushers and computer operators of all stripes, drug addicts, and so on. The companies will naturally game the system by soaking up all available dollars to hire their nephews and grandchildren and in-laws.\n\nIt's not a simple problem to solve.

            "Hey, here\u2019s a hammer and some glue, go fix that bridge or building or highway that\u2019s looking pretty creeky.  \nThese jobs require very skilled civil engineers, mechanical engineers, contractors, architects, construction crews, etc.  They can\u2019t be done by just anybody.  These aren\u2019t government jobs.  They may be paid for by the government, but these are completed by highly skilled people from actual firms and companies that specialize in this type of thing.",

            "Why don\u2019t the unemployed people apply for jobs with the road construction contractors?",
            "First off, you're massively underestimating the amount of skill and physical ability it takes to fix failing roads and bridges.  You can't just throw unskilled labor at it and hope the workers figure it out.  That would be a major safety liability and the job might never finish.\n\nSecondly, someone still has to pay for all the material and no one in their right mind is going to spend millions on material and hand it over to people who are unverified.\n\nThird.  Fixing roads and bridges requires the use of heavy equipment and those operators need to be trained and trusted.  You don't want a person with possible substance abuse problems operating heavy equipment.  Massive safety liability.\n\nFourth.  Typically, laborers are in a union which pays more than double $15/hour.  Like myself, I had to pay $800 up front just to join.  This would be the smartest thing for an unemployed person to do, if someone could front them that initial money.\n\nFifth.  You don't just need labor to fix roads and bridges, you need engineers, planners, safety inspectors, material inspectors, and traffic control.\n\nSixth reason this wouldn't work.  The unemployment situation isn't as easily remidied as giving them work and hoping for the best.  A lot of people don't want to work.\n\nThere already are programs like what you're talking about but mostly trash picking, recycling, or other work that doesn't really need to be supervised.  \"Community service\".",
            "Not everyone has the ability to work in construction",
            "Because that requires jobs skills that many people do not have",
            "A few reasons \n\n1) skills. Training people takes time and money. \n\n2) money. It costs a lot\n\n3) vested interests. In any effort there are well established companies this space.

Let the schools do it you get something designed in 1910.",
            "TL;DR if it still works, you're still gonna sit on it.  Saves money for the University since they don't care that much. More students need to speak up about it to make changes happen.  Too many generations of students that just make do and use the shit chairs.\n\nI'm talking only universities here, not middle or high school. OP may have meant that.\n\n\nOn a throwaway...\n\nMay get buried but I hope I can help with an answer from my day to day experience.\n\nOk, old chairs in class right?  So we have to ask the question, how does your school do with fixing things?  Is it pretty good inside and out? Is the outside shitty but the inside good?  Is the inside shitty but the outside good?\n\nYou say 60 year old chairs, so let's go with inside shitty, outside good.  Your school puts a lot of effort into making sure it will look good, online and in physical tours.  Landscapers are going all the time and the grass is definitely nice and cut.  Windows washed, you may run into custodial/janitors outside but never really inside...\n\nSo with that, chairs/furniture are the last thing on any Facilities manager's mind.  Hey, if it ain't broke don't fix it.  Chair 60 years old and works? That's some /r/bifl, buy it for life material my friend.  We ain't getting new ones til they all go down.  Lights work? Doors open and close? Enough seats for the amount of butts?  Check, check, check!  Let's move on to the 60 year old toilets and that nice fountain outside, needs to be shiny!\n\nPoint being, you need to see what your school type is with the inside/outside question first.  The 60 year old chairs are from an era of working until they melted in hot magma.  The chairs in the class aren't to keep you awake or anything like that, it's just works enough to last an entire day.  They are kept and maintained as a cost cutting feature.\n\nThere are new, good desks out there and they work well but have to get approvals from a thousand people to make sure they work.  Plus, they are most likely bigger than those 60 year old chairs, so the capacity is definitely going to get trimmed in those rooms, can't have that, so we're not buying because we have a ton of new students coming and need all the damn room we can get into these classes.\n\nAlso, private/public is something to pay attention to.  Your school is most likely public, so again they won't spend money on things that seem simple, like chairs.  Public school but good chairs?  Means that they are using money INSIDE AND OUTSIDE, probably missing a sports team or two.  Private school? If your ass doesn't have a good chair, they are either late to fixing that particular class/place, they are waiting for a catalog to just pick a chair, or they are TERRIBLY mismanaging money.  I've toured both types around the country, it's just crazy what private can do \n\nAll in all, seems pretty simple right?  Mostly sad, but simple.  I'm working to get better everything on the inside.  Tough to get change, but the best way to do it is actually from students saying that the chairs/desks/anything in a classroom is awful and needs to be replaced.  I've been yelling about it for a while now, and nothing seems to move the administration more than one student pointing at it and going, nope this sucks.\n\nDo your part! Make a change!  I'll be glad to bust my ass and get it done for you.\n\nWould you like to know more?",

But even then we are usually doing other maintanence that we can't do with kids around, like striping and rewaxing any tile floors. Cleaning tables and chairs is one of our lowest priority jobs and if it gets done it will be right before school starts.\n\nFinally we really do try to ditch what old stuff we can but we have to have something to replace it with and unless we literally don't have enough chairs for the kids the district won't give us money to buy new ones and even then it usually is only enough to replace the broken ones",

            "Go to the American Southwest - specifically New Mexico and Arizona, near the reservations. There are tons of small restaurants that serve fry bread and traditional Native American foods.\n\nBut in general, the most famous foods of my grandfather's people (Aps\u00e1alooke) were pemmican and buffalo. Root vegetables aren't really in the market. Berries, yes. But not a lot of carbs. \n\nFor obvious reasons (IE, the mass killing of the buffalo herds and a lack of open range) there ain't a lot of buffalo around any more. And like one of my elders said, \"if you want traditional Native American food, you'll have to travel back in time and starve for a while. We found better things to eat. Nobody eats the whole buffalo when there's burritos, sushi, and Mac and cheese.\"\n\nSure, there are plenty of traditional foods still made but the delicacies that sustained various tribes were very specific to the regions where they lived. \n\nFor example, the camas root is PNW, the root wasn't consumed by the Algonquin or the Iroquois. Buffalo wasn't routinely eaten by the Hopi or the Pueblo. Elk wasn't often a staple of the Cherokee or the Tallahassee, and squash and beans were rarely a part of the Chinook, Duwamish, Swinomish, or Nooksack diet (salmon, berries, deer, yes. Squash and beans? Noooope).\n\nPoint being that an all-in-one Native American restaurant isn't really a thing because Native American cuisine was never a unified thing. But there are restaurants by reservations run by Native Americans that have their specialties as adapted to the modern cultural business of America.\n\nHonestly, though, if you eat alder-smoked salmon or cedar-planked deer backstrap over an alder fire, that is as close to NA cuisine as you're going to get. Food in NA culture was (and is still, sadly, in many tribes and reservations across America) less a matter of \"cuisine\" and more a matter of finding calories sufficient to get you and your family through to the next day without starving.",

            "Native Americans didn't really develop a \"dining culture\" that was comparable to France, Spain, or places like Mexico for a few reasons - poverty and destruction of their culture being the biggest factors, with poverty probably being the single biggest one. Reservations are often REALLY poor.\n\nSo that leads to very few Indians being able to get investment in their restaurants - you see way more food trucks out West than you do restaurants. And you don't really have a ton of \"staple\" foods like you do with something like Mexican - with Mexican food you have things like tacos, burritos, etc. With Italian you have pasta dishes, with British food you have Shepherd's Pie and beef stew, with Japanese you have Sushi, etc. With Native Food, there's fry bread - but most people don't know what that is, and there aren't a lot of easily recognizable dishes that people know and love, which makes it even harder for a restaurant to take off. It's hard to overestimate how difficult it is to sell people on food they don't know very well. So that's another uphill battle to getting restaurants opened.\n\nSo I'd say it's a conflation of a few factors - the fact that traditional Mexican food is actually pretty similar to a lot of Native American food, but people already know what to expect with Mexican - so you're competing in very similar food arenas, against a VERY well recognized and well-loved type of food. And tbh, having had both, modern Mexican is much more to my taste than modern Native American food, even though the latter was quite good. I think that's true for a lot of Americans - Native American food can taste a bit like Mexican food that is a bit blander. That sounds like a bash against the food, but I think it's partially realistic - it's going to be much easier to sell someone on a plate of Al Pastor tacos than it will be to sell someone on having grilled squash on fry bread (if you don't like squash, you're probably not gonna be into Native food at all either lol)\n\nSo you're dealing with a fairly similar food type being popular, extreme poverty among the people who would be opening the restaurants in the first place, the fact that most people don't recognize any staple dishes (ask people what a Native American dish is and you'll probably get a blank stare, or they'll list fry bread and nothing else). It's already really hard to get a restaurant started, and all those factors make it much much harder.",

I use to frequently visit a reservation for work / training and we all ate at this awesome chophouse that served native dishes as well as typical steakhouse food and it was just called \"Sam's \"  but once the casino opened their buffet and  McDonalds, Chilis and Wendy's came in Sam's closed. \n\nYour best bet is to look for small family owned businesses on or near res land and you will find awesome small businesses that will serve a dish or two of native or fusion food.",
            "I had some great food at little restaurants around Montana many years ago. Better luck in the West as it took longer for them to be exposed and scattered.\n\nI always love the obligatory fry bread at a Powwow too - tastes like victory!\n\nAny dish with the Three Sisters (beans, squash, corn) is a hit for my family. \n\nA lot of what is offered at Thanksgiving is from us. Turkey, cranberries, wild rice, all the potatoes and corn dishes, etc.\n\nMy main tribe (I'm a blend of delicious spices) loves wild onions and we eat them with everything! Always more wild onions than whatever else is on the plate. I'm a fan of frying up some bacon, using that grease to crisp up some sliced potatoes that I have already cooked in the oven, and then adding a giant heap of wild onions. It's scrumptious! \n\nJust wanted to also say thanks! Thanks for remembering we exist. I think we don't have a lot of restaurants because we, as a whole, are ridiculously poor and the US Government tends to punish (i.e., control the money) those tribes who try to better themselves. From my personal experience, you either get to stay on the Rez and be yourself or integrate into American culture and then \\*poof\\* most of who you are dies out. My family is sort of stuck somewhere between those two worlds. The government put my grandparents in boarding schools and that just about took us out of the game.",

            "Hi, the SF bay area has a few, or had a few, recently.\n\nGoing to them, you realize that indigenous food could mean a couple of things. Either it means \"pre-columbian\" food, made entirely with \"new world\" veg, grain, meat, or it could mean the food indigenous people ate after colonization.\n\nIn the first pre-columbian case, you're dealing with \\*much\\* more obscure set of ingredients that are hard to source. And those ingredients aren't available on tribal lands for 100 years either: the populations of grazing and hunting weren't avaialble on tribal lands either, and that happened for enough generations that the old ways were greatly lost.\n\nIn the second, you're serving what really becomes poverty level food, like government cheese given to reservations. Things like \"indian tacos\" can be good, but it frankly reminds me that america is built off a very dark history, and while we all should be reminded of that, it's not something pleasant.\n\nIt seemed like it might become trendy for a bit.

            "Not to sound mean or to blame anyone; a lot of our traditional Native American Cuisine and traditional foods were wiped out, made illegal, polluted or repressed in boarding schools.\n\nSo we adapted. Many tribes became reliant on the government for food so our day to day food changed. This made many of us unhealthy.\n\nBut now, things are changing and some old ways are becoming new again.\n\nCurrently I\u2019m working on putting together a channel, Instagram, writing a cook book and creating content around this revival or tradition.\n\nI made a post about how juniper is used, by burning it the leaves salt is made. This is important because our environment lacks it naturally. And this has been a traditional way to fortify and flavor our food.\n\nSo with all that being said, I\u2019m learning about foraging and the traditional aspects so I can teach the younger generation and anyone willing to learn. \n\nThanks for your time, follow me audioarsonist on Instagram if you are interested. Eventually I will be releasing more.",
            "It\u2019s late, but I\u2019ll chime in as an actual Indigenous person who has worked on food systems (I started an Indigenous farmer\u2019s market in Minneapolis.) \n\nBeyond all the other reasons people have stated, it\u2019s really hard to open up a restaurant that needs to buy food that isn\u2019t available from major distributors. \n\nThe magic of Owamni is that Sean didn\u2019t just open up a restaurant, he had to do decades of research, foraging, finding farmers and ranchers, not to mention teaching cooks how to use ingredients that they\u2019ve never worked with. He created his own supply-chain, from scratch.\n\nSo if you want to open a Native restaurant that is \u201cauthentic\u201d it basically has to be expensive, because your food costs are going to be dramatically higher if you\u2019re serving hand-harvested wild rice instead of something off the back of a Sysco truck. \n\nTo add to that, most tribal people ate very seasonally, so it can be even harder to be able to source produce and meat/seafood to be able to deliver a consistent array of dishes and not have to change the menu frequently.\n\nAnd one last thing, oddly also not mentioned here: few native people have access to the sort of capital it takes to open a restaurant. Before Owamni and Indigenous Food Lab opened, Sean had to spend years catering, writing a cookbook, and running a food truck. Things he also had to crowdfund on occasion.\n\nSupport your local Indigenous food makers, they\u2019re working harder than you know. And support Land Back, so we can keep making good food.",
            "We have one in Sioux Falls called Watecha Bowl. They started out as a food truck and then opened a storefront. It is excellent. Owners are friendly, food is good, and they have Native American culture and information about Native American history on the walls. I wish we had more places like it!",
            "They exist. Instead of searching for \"native American\" or \"indian\" restaurants try searching for the actual tribe/nation name.\n\n For example, there's multiple places that serve \"traditional Cherokee\" food in western North Carolina. There's also places that serve \"Appalachian\" food which tends to be heavily influenced by Cherokee recipes. \n\nIt's also worth considering that in the last 300 or so years traditions will have changed so recipes being \"authentic\" is subjective.",
            "Uhh.. only time I ever seen any native restaurant was in Arizona. Cool lil frybread taco spot. \n\nThe problem with this question is native food varies by region. The food native alaskans eat isn\u2019t the same as Arizonans or Oklahomans and so forth. Even if there was restaurants it would never be the same for each state."

I\u2019ve lived enough decades to have experienced really really good cake. Eating a cake from Costco or Safeway now just isn\u2019t worth it. Not near good enough.

            "Because they don't understand what being tired means or how to fix it. They cry because that is their main form of conversing with others. When they are tired, or hungry, or hurt, they don't know what it means, how to fix it, or anything, so they cry to get our attention for us to fix.",
            "Interestingly enough, many grown ups also behave erratically, become more irritable or even sad, when tired, instead of just going to sleep.\n\nWe (humans) are not as good as we think we are at figuring out what we feel or why we feel it.",
            "They don't understand that what they're feeling is \"tired\" and that going to sleep will fix it. Plus, sometimes, babies and little kids don't WANT to go to bed because it's boring. They also might be experiencing some kind of discomfort that they can't articulate keeping them from falling asleep, such as teething or they're too warm or cool. Processing a feeling and coming up with a solution independently is something that has to be learned.",
            "So according to my daughters pediatrician, not only do they not make the connection between feeling tired and sleep, they may also resist going to sleep because they are instictually afraid of becoming unconscious. Just like babies toes curl around things as a leftover reflex to grip branches, and will hold their breathe as soon as they go under water, they also \"know\" that if they are asleep they can't cry for help if something is wrong.",
            "I have this conversation with my 7m/o baby every night. It's like he's not even listening",
            "Because existence is pain",
            "This was (and still is) my number 1 gripe as a parent. Then I remember that my child for 9 straight months never knew any sort of discomfort. There was no night or day, all noises were surrounded by the overwhelming noise of my blood rushing around / my heartbeat, no hunger, no being too cold or too hot, no just being uncomfortable in general.\n\nBeing a baby and learning to sleep again is like leaving the best / most comfortable bed you\u2019ve ever had (the one with 2-3 pillows of perfect density, the heavy but not too hot duvet and the nice high thread count sheets) and trying to sleep at a cheap motel. It\u2019s really fricken hard.",
            "Does no one have a memory at about 4 or 5 feeling absolutely exhausted because you're sick and the bed is uncomfortable because you're hot and yet you feel cold and your stomach hurts or your ear hurts or you cant stop coughing and its making your head hurt and you're exhausted but you don't feel like you can sleep so you start crying because the world sucks and your parent coming in to just hold you then you wake up feeling better?\n\nAs infants it isn't just about feeling uncomfortable. Sometimes they are tired but not tired enough to actually fall asleep. Sometimes they cry because they are scared and mom and dad are their safe space. Sometimes it's something as little as \"Im lonely I need you hold me\" and you sit next to them they can see your face and they can fall asleep. Sometimes they have gone past the point of exhausted and cant sleep because of it. You also need to remember as an infant you cant shift your weight or roll to get comfortable. You rely on your parents to make sure you aren't wet. You aren't thirsty or hungry. That your body isn't in an uncomfortable position. That you aren't cold or hot because infants aren't the best at body temp regulation. This is why I never let my kids cry it out. If they cried more then a couple minutes I was on it. Because there was something they needed!\n\nAlso great tip. There are different cries by infants that change sound based on how their mouth is shaped. The mouth shape can tell you what they need. Like when they're hungry their suck reflex is more activated so they'll cry like \"neh neh neh\".\nWhen tired it's more \"owh owh owh\" like a yawn.\nWhen they need to burp \"eh eh eh\" because they're trying to push the burp up. When lower more of a \"eairh eairh eairh\" because they're trying to fart. And then the rest are normally \"heh heh heh\"\n\nA lot of mother's respond to these cues automatically and without realizing that's why they know what their baby needs. But yeah.",
            "They don't know how.   \nThey don't understand what feeling tired means, and they don't know how to just \"go to sleep\".   All this crap is brand new to them.",
            "They can't. It might not feel like it as an older person, but being able to settle yourself and fall asleep is a *skill* you have to learn. Babies not only don't have that skill yet - they don't even recognise what *tired* means. They don't take that feeling and connect it with \"I'm sleepy\" the way an adult/older child does; all they know is that something's wrong. And their survival programming as infants is that when something's wrong, you call for mum and dad. That's literally the only way they know to respond to something like that.",
            "If they don't attract attention from time to time they'd get eaten by something. surviving in nature for them required reminding people they were around. Think of how long you might leave them alone if they didn't make noise all the time.",

As many have said here, it\u2019s tough in the moment to realize you\u2019re one or many of those things. Another good one is Bored.  \n  \nSo if we are experiencing a craving, or wanting to use, we are suggested to stop and recognize if in fact it\u2019s one of those feelings instead, and address it.",

            "It has something to do with their nervous system not being fully developed yet. Being able to sleep when tired seems logical, but babies and even kids don\u2019t sleep the same as adults because they have a very different circadian rhythm. \n\nIt\u2019s ok though, they catch up by about age four.

            "Sleeping is actually a skill. You have to learn how to know the difference between when it is safe to lie down and go to sleep, and when staying awake would be safer. That takes experience and a certain level of cognitive skill, both of which babies don't have much of.",

Yes, the same book every night.  I have it fucking memorized at this point.  We have two copies, just in case we lose one - or go on a trip.  \n\nThen, I kiss her on the forehead, tell her it's time for her to go to bed (she's almost always half asleep at this point) - put her in her crib at 7:00pm on the fucking dot; and she's out like a light until 6:30am.  Every.  Fucking.  Night.\n\nShe knows it's time for bed; because the routine informs her so.  By the time I'm reading Goodnight Moon, it's like a mystical incantation.

And everything is so new and exciting to their developing brains, all that stimulus keeps them awake past when they need to recharge.

            ">Shooting into a room full of innocent people as they cower in fear \"is very sadistic,\" O'Toole said. \"And sadistic violence like this is almost exclusively male.\" \n\n>Most men, of course, go through life without killing anyone. And motives for crime are very individual; not all women and men who kill do so for the same reasons. Each case is unique, experts stress. But something in the combination of male biology and socialization makes men more prone to violence. Notably, the gender gap in violence is found in almost every culture around the world, Garbarino said.\n\n>**There are no simple answers. The easiest theory to digest is probably an evolutionary one: Males, over hundreds of thousands of years of development, have historically been rewarded for aggression.** A tendency toward violence is seen in chimpanzees, humans' closest living primate relative. (Bonobos, humanity's other close primate family member, are far more peaceful, though recent research has shown they are drawn to jerks.) Violence can beget status for males, both in chimps and in humans (just look at how many action heroes get the girl). And for males, a lack of status can mean missing out on the chance to mate.\n\n>Indeed, sexual frustration is a theme running through the writings of many male mass shooters, Lankford said. Many shooters leave manifestos explicitly detailing their hatred of women and of men who seemed to navigate relationships with women with ease.\n\n>\"By contrast, I'm not aware of any female attackers, even though we have a small sample, I don't know that any of them complained about not being able to have sex,\" Lankford said.    \n\n>Status plays a large role in school shootings, a particularly male phenomenon, said Katherine Newman, a sociologist at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Newman, author of \"Rampage: The Social Roots of School Shootings\" (Basic Books, 2005), argues that there has never been a typical school shooting with a female perpetrator. A case in San Diego in 1979 involved a teenage girl who lived across from an elementary school and started shooting children and staff from her home one morning. But in cases of random shootings on school grounds by a person who is part of that school's community, the perpetrators are all male, Newman told Live Science.\n\n>These boys and young men may be responding to a cultural script that equates violence with masculinity, Newman said. Most are not loners. Instead, they try to join social groups but struggle. Their experience is one of disappointment and humiliation. So, they decide to trade in their \"loser\" persona for something more appealing, according to Newman.\n\n>\"Sadly for all of us, that something more appealing is the role of the antihero,\" Newman said.\n\n>Girls aren't similarly targeted with the notion that becoming a violent antihero is appealing, Newman said. Their reputational struggles play out in other ways, usually involving self-harm or nasty gossip.\n\n>The gap in aggression between girls and boys has narrowed, though, said Garbarino, author of \"See Jane Hit: Why Girls Are Growing More Violent and What We Can Do About It\" (The Penguin Press HC, 2006). More popular media show girls and women acting in violent ways, which provides role models for female aggression, he said.\n\n>Still, the gender gap in lethal violence hasn't shrunk like the gap in general violence, Garbarino said. It's a mystery as to why. Men may be biologically vulnerable: Variations in a gene called MAOA combined with early developmental stressors like abuse or drug use can raise a man's risk of criminality. Men are also more likely than women to base moral decisions on abstract principles rather than on empathy, Garbarino said.\n\n[Female Mass Killers: Why They\u2019re So Rare](https://www.livescience.com/53047-why-female-mass-shooters-are-rare.html)\n\nEdit: Several people have commented that mass shootings occur only in the US, but that is not true--the US doesn't even have the most people killed in mass shootings *per capita*. Norway holds that honor, thanks to the shooting of 77 people a few years back. Take a look at [World Population Review](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/mass-shootings-by-country)'s page, \"Mass Shootings by Country 2021\"\n\n>For a highly developed and wealthy nation, the United States has an unusually high rate of mass shootings. However, it is a common misconception that it is the worst country globally in terms of mass shooting rates. The truth of the matter is that the United States is number sixty-six on the list of countries in terms of mass shooting rates per capita, but they have had more mass shootings than any other country in terms of overall numbers.",

            "Men are responsible for far more violence in general, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s surprising that most mass shooters and serial killers are male, either. As for WHY men are typically more violent, there are a million reasons from biology to sociology. It\u2019s very complex",
            "So as someone who studied criminal justice it really boils down to how male and females connect to their victims and how their emotions play into their crimes. Women tend to commit crimes against people they know intimately( like spouses, their children, other family members). Anger, betrayal, hatred women feel tend to be towards someone in particular rather than a large group. Therefore they will kill in more subtle ways and don\u2019t make spectacles of the murder. \n\nMen on the other hand tend to vary in that regard. But we do see a trend in their anger, betrayal, hatred feelings be placed on a large group of people and why the mass shootings tend to happen though both genders do use firearms. \n\nIt\u2019s kind of complicated and it\u2019s really interesting to deep dive into these things but that\u2019s basically the gist of it. It\u2019s also important to keep in mind that the horrors that happen is the suspects/perpetrators attempt to gain control in a period of time where they don\u2019t feel they have any. That can also drive to different responses. It\u2019s pretty wild.",

But if you take into account that they both have a normal distribution then almost all of the 1/10's will be women and similarly almost all of the 10/10s will be men.\n\nUsually these mass shootings etc are catalysed by terrible upbringing or poor mental health or being fed  hateful lies or consuming hateful ideas. So when a 10/10 aggressive person gets landed with a life where they experience some or all of these things etc then they can result in incredbly violent out bursts and will almost always be men.\n\nAlso keep in mind that amoung men theres is a very strong stigma around mental health and venting etc so even if there was an exceptionally aggressive women it may be they she would have grown up with better mechanisms for coping with negative emotion.\n\nNote: I picked aggressiveness for ease but obviously theres many personality traits etc that can play into this.",

When societal norms punish for (or prevent people from) addressing their needs or being treated as subhuman...these people break those norms in a big way when they believe it's the best option.

            "I can't speak for every man, so take this with a grain of salt.\n\nIt always seemed that as young men we're taught that we're entitled to a certain amount of power and control in our lives. When we're, \"denied\" this power and control, an act of grandiose violence seems to be an acceptable response. Similar to when an abusive father flips the table at dinner. It wasn't a reasonable response on his part, but everyone present will still try to modify their own behavior in order to avoid further violence.\n\nWhen men of any age behave irresponsibly and irrationally we're typically defended rather than shamed. Like: \"Boys will be boys.\" Or something similar. \n\nSo if a troubled man feels that he's losing control and he concludes that extreme violence is necessary to reassert it, people will typically show him sympathy and defend his actions, no matter how irrational they were.\n\nAfter every mass shooting committed by a white man that I've seen, there is ALWAYS efforts to re-humanize him and sympathize. To me, this is essentially someone saying, \"Remember, he has every right to be violent when we don't behave. Just be better and maybe this abuse will stop.\"\n\nIt's victim blaming because a large part of our culture teaches young men that when they don't get what they want they need to respond with abuse and violence, and everyone else involved is at fault for not meeting his expectations in one way or another. \n\nIt's a man's way of expressing his frustration over his lack of control that he felt he was entitled to.",

            "i mean, why do way more men commit suicide than women? might be completely unrelated, maybe its got something to do with our biology, but i feel like maybe theres a connection. While we have come along way in gender equality, i feel like societal expectations towards men havent really changed at all over the past 100 years. women are \"alowed\" and encouraged to be independent and provide for themselves, but they dont have to if they dont want to. they can still choose to look for other peoples help and show weakness if they want to, and either way its considered to be brave.\n\nnow as a man, if you arent strong and independent, youre a failure, a looser, and people arent gonna hesitate to tell you. especially online, you WILL be made fun of. and if you show any signs of being hurt by all of that, its just gonna make it worse. If you fail, its your fault, and while im sure its not like this everywhere, its the reason why so many young guys nowadays feel isolated and dont have friends. When you hear the phrase \"grow up\" or \"be a man\" over and over while growing up, you quickly learn that people dont want to hear what troubles you, they are annoyed so all you can do is bottle it up inside.\n\nnow when you live in a world that seems to not give a flying fuck about you or your emotions, its easy to get angry and look for things you can blame your misery on. sometimes you see everything wrong with the world in yourself, which makes alot of people kill themselves, and sometimes people blame everything but themselves, so they take it out on others.\n\nmaybe all of this is nonsense, this is just my drunk opinion.",

            "> **Why are mass shootings only perpetuated by males?** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>  only 9 of 250 mass shootings in the US from 2000 to 2017 involved a female shooter \n\nSemantics, but your original question should have been \"why are mass shootings disproportionately perpetuated by males\".\n\nI'm no psychologist but I think speaking from a place of rationale and reason it's easy to look at how warfare is marketed to males as opposed to females. The industry of weaponry and warfare is vastly targeted towards males. Hunting magazines are filled with dudes with all kinds of rifles and pistols. The toy industry puts billions of dollars into promoting toys that promote warfare - G.I. Joe, Nerf, etc. The video game industry is also by and large dominated by male players, though females have joined the fray in large numbers over the past 20 years, but outside of that every Call of Duty and Battlefield game is saturated with manly dudes doing \"manly war stuff\". *YOU* are the hero in most of these games. It might be odd to hear this, but there's a certain amount of romanticism surrounding it all, and it plays to what we're taught and shown as a male's base instincts of fighting for what you believe in. Even professional sports... they talk about fighting for a playoff spot. \n\nYou also have the stigmas of \"manliness\", such as \"just don't talk about your problems.. toughen up! Be a **MAN!** Why don't you grow a pair!\" There's so much toxicity surrounded the stigma of manliness. Being \"manly\" doesn't be a derogatory aspect, and it shouldn't be toxic, but toxic people get on social media and stigmatize \"manliness\" and then you hear people talk \"iT's An AtTaCk On MeNs!\" Toxic. It's toxic from both sides.\n\nAll of this is fairly anecdotal but it's really easy to look at the evidence and the state of society in the things that I mentioned and NOT see how it adds to a violent nature in males; which isn't to say that \"males are violent\". That's not the takeaway from this. The takeaway is that boys/males are targeted from a young age and across a wide swath of industries in a way that promotes violence. There are millions of video gamers who will never pick up a real gun and shoot another person, and there are a very minor portion of that population who *will* see gun violence as the only solution to their perceived problem. Those people are mentally vulnerable and that's why it's important to have approachable and affordable mental health care available for everyone.",

            "Even if the differences between genders is really really small, it gets exaggerated at the extremes. Only the most violent people will commit such an act. If it's a bell curve, while at the middle it might be a, say, 49.9-50.1 split, at the end, you'll see way more men. Same goes with the prison population, the homeless population, billionaires, etc.",
            "> Is it related somehow to the psychological differences in men vs. women?\n\nProbably, since single-offender violent crime is much more likely to be committed by a male.  Look at page 26 in https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cvus0702.pdf to see in 2007 that only ~20% of single-offender violent crimes were committed by women.\n\nAnecdotally, I think a big factor is in male culture during development.  As boys, we are very physical and it's just \"boys will be boys.\"  I routinely had my friends do things like dead-arm me and tackle me and smash me into things.  I have also accidentally broken friends' bones getting too physical during things like street hockey.  All of this and I am definitely what you would consider as a nerd, being on the receiving end from my stronger/bigger friends.  Then to top it off if you are always on the receiving end of this then one day you might just explode and a gun is the one tool to empower your rage as you've never felt power from within before.",
            "It's a great question and the even bigger thinker here is that 90% of all violent crime across the board is committed by men. I dont think it means men are bad or biologically designed to be this way, it's largely a societal issue",

            "My personal opinion? Look at the reasons why mass shooters commit the act to begin with. It's almost always because they are at the bottom of the barrel of society. They're outcasts. \n\nThere is an expectation of society that men will take care of themselves. If a man can't fit into this mold there is no one to take care of them. There's no one that gives them sympathy. If a woman is down and out society takes care of them. Whether that be the government, their family or a man. A man who can't take care of himself is seen as weak and despicable. \n\nSo a man who can't take care of himself is put in a desperate situation. He either accepts his situation of nothingness. Dies. Or goes out in a blaze of glory. \n\nWhen you look at the mass shootings that have been carried out this is usually the reason. A man who has been slighted or outcast or oppressed or wronged in one way or another who decides to carry out his revenge on the society that did it to him. They see it as their only option because for one reason of another they have failed in society or are outcast and don't see any way out. \n\nThere is an enormous mental health stigma towards men. If a woman has mental health struggles it's okay for her to be cared for. She has infinited possibilities of marriage or living with her parents or living off the government. Society has ample protection mechanisms for women in place with little to no stigma or negative repurcussions. \n\nNone exist for men. Men do not have that option. Most will turn to drugs or alcohol or crime to survive. Kill themselves. Or simply bear it in silence. \n\nAnd sometimes they decide to take it out on the society that enacted it upon them. \n\nThat's my theory as to the reason for why men are almost always the perpetrators of mass violence.",

The modern canadians have almost as many guns(and are probably, on average, better shots) but don't have anywhere near the mass shooting problem Americans have. Central and south america are shot through with machismo and violent guerilla movements (thanks cia!), but spree killers are, relative to the US; uncommon there.\n\nSo unless you're willing to talk about the evolutionary differences between Americans and canadians, let's not resort to evo psych bullshit. it's the culture.",
