The evolution from \u201cnistametchungus\u201d to \u201cchumungus\u201d is a common thing humans do (mixing up placement of syllables) when we hear a totally new word, especially placing the last syllables first.\n\nSmall children learning to speak tend to get the last part of words down before the first parts, and sometimes mix them up, same with adults learning a new language. (I believe this is called the Pimsleur method on how to teach foreign languages) So I really think OP is hearing \u201cnice to meet you guys\u201d, English speakers have a tendency to roll \u201cmeet you\u201d into \u201cmeechoo\u201d making it hard for the untrained ear to separate the two words."

            "[deleted]",
            "[deleted]",
            "This question is a few levels deep. \n\n1) if you shoot back, will you be charged? \n\nThe answer here is invariably yes. You will face some form of criminal charges, regardless of outcome. What happens next is entirely dependant on circumstance and jurisdiction.\n\n2) Is this self-defense? \n\nThat depends on whether the LEO was performing under his duties. You cannot claim self-defense in resisting arrest or lawful use of force. If the cop was in uniform, or had otherwise identified themselves as a police officer, self-defense will most likely not apply unless the person can show that the officer's use of force was not protected by their badge. (That is a damn near unsellable pitch though.)\n\nA self-defense argument is about what a reasonable person, put in the same position, would do. If a reasonable person would return fire, a self-defense claim will most likely succeed as a defense, *so long as the force they are responding to is unlawful (Model Penal Code 3.04 (1)). The exact wording of the law will vary by jurisdiction. \n\n3) The trickiest thing about this question is that the person the cop os shooting at did nothing wrong. Inder the model penal code, a police officer may not use deadly force to affect an arrest unless: (1) the person the officer is attacking is a violent felon, (2) there is no other way to arrest them without endangering themselves or the public, and (3) there is no risk to any innocent parties. While the MPC is no law, it is a powerful argument and many states have reformed their penal codes and taken on large portions of the MPC. \n\nSo even assuming that there were no other innocent parties nearby, and that the officer falsely believes our victim to be a violent felony, we still run into the issue of whether deadly force is needed to make the arrest. Since we lack information on the disposition of our victim, only that he has committed no crime, it is not reasonable for the officer to believe that lethal force is required to arrest the individual\n\nThe only other time a police officer is allowed to use lethal force is in a self-defense situation. Again, however, we lack sufficient information to come to a supported position here. \n\nIn a perfect world, the self-defense argument would work if there were no other factors. Innocent man, walking down the street, suddenly gets shot at by a police officer. It is entirely reasonable for them to return fire since the officer has greatly overreached the bounds of their authority.\n\nIn the real world, it is unlikely that the man would be acquitted, assuming he makes it to a court room. The reason for this is simple. People like to believe cops. People don't like the possibility that the police are not as upstanding as they should be. Police testimony is given a great deal more weight than other people's.",
            "In theory - it would depend on whether the police had a legitimate cause to shoot at the man in the first place. \n\nIn reality - he will *definitely* be charged with a crime (whether he's convicted or not may be a different story).",
            "If you survive:\n\nYou would certainly be arrested\n\nYou would probably be charged with a felony\n\nYou may prevail in court if the facts are in your favor and you have a good attorney\n\nIn the very likely event that you are killed:\n\nThe police officer will probably not face any criminal charges\n\nYour family may have grounds for a civil action",
            "You would probably be charged, but self-defense is a trial argument that might or might not be successful.\n\nOnly way it avoids going to a jury is if the details were extreme against the individual cops and in favor of the civilian, and the prosecutors don't want to embarrass themselves and the police department.",

Mark was dealing drugs and one day 2 guys approach him and pulled their guns out, mark thought he was being robbed. Mark being in the military quickly reacted and shot them before they could get a shot off. It turned out they were dirty cops who were actually trying to rob him. ",
            "Follow this rule of thumb. If a cop shoots at you, shooting back just adds justification. They will do their level best to murder you, investigate themselves, and find they did nothing wrong.\n\nIn our city, there was a motorcycle shop owner who was taken hostage by one of his regulars. 2 people in the entire shop. They called in 4 swat teams.\n\nIn the standoff that followed, one of the officers was tagged in the helmet with a bullet. Protocol dictated that he was removed from site for medical eval.\n\nShortly later the shop owner was riddled with bullets because he got away from the hostage-taker, and ran out the door firing his own gun back into the shop.\n\nNot only was that officer found back on the 'firing line', all officers were cleared of several other procedural violations and given citations.

            "Are they white or black?",
            "So, it depends.\n\nAll info for the US\n\nFirst of all, being innocent has no bearing in this. A court decides whether you're innocent or not. Everyone is innocent until a verdict is made.\n\nSecond of all, it depends on what the cops are doing. Are they executing a warrant? Are they defending others?\n\nIf they're executing a warrant:\n\nIt depends on jurisdiction *and whether the warrant is valid.*\n\nNow this is a big misconception: *Being innocent does not mean a warrant is invalid.* As I said above, your innocence doesn't actually matter. So just because you think the cops think you have no reason to be arresting you, doesn't mean you're right. It's entirely possible you're 100% innocent and have committed no crime but the police are still executing a valid warrant anyway.\n\nThat said, in *some* (very few) states, it's legal to use necessary force (including lethal force) to defend yourself in an illegal arrest. *I do not recommend anyone try to do this*, because again you have no idea if the arrest is legal or not-- but more importantly, even if the arrest is invalid, the cops either don't know or don't care and if you start shooting at them **they will shoot back and you will probably die**. But if the arrest should happen to be invalid and you used lethal force, it might be a valid defense.\n\nIn some states though, so long as the police are acting in line with their authority as officers, you can't use force at all. Even if they have no valid warrant to arrest you.\n\nNow if they're *not* acting in their authority as officers, meaning a cop has gotten drunk and decided to go on a wild rampage, then you can use lethal force to defend yourself or others. *This is not something you want to take a guess at.* Only use force in this situation if there's absolutely no other way to defend your life or the life of another.\n\nThere's also a factor of whether or not you knew they were police acting in their official capacity, or not. For instance, if an undercover officer starts shooting without identifying themselves you might have a defense.\n\nNow, if they're shooting at you because they think you're an active gunman or some such-- in other words, in defense of another-- then all bets are off. In this case, your best bet is to lay down any weapons and try everything you can to show them you are not a danger. Whether or not you could, in theory, kill them in defense... *maybe*, but chances are you're just gonna end up dead.\n\nSo to answer your question: Ultimately, it depends. Do not question whether they should be shooting-- that's a case to make in court. If they allow you the opportunity to surrender peacefully, do it.\n\nIf they don't, then I guess you can make your own decisions but if my opportunities are try to defend the shooting in court\n\nor *definitely get shot by police*\n\nthen I'd rather take my chances in court. But *only if there's no other way.*\n\nBut if they afford you the opportunity to surrender peacefully, and you have no reason to believe they're lying/corrupt, then take the opportunity to surrender, even if you think you shouldn't have to. Argue about it later in court, instead of trying to shoot your way to freedom.",

            "There are cases where people have been able to legally shoot police officers. They are rare, and are usually cases of police screwing up, mistaken identity or just bad luck/timing. \n\nA few months back there was a case (in California i believe) where police were on foot pursuing a suspect through backyards in a residential area. One of the homeowners (who had no idea what was going on) heard commotion in his yard, saw a guy with a gun in his yard (it was dark out) and shot and injured the guy. Who it turns out was a police officer. No charges were filed on the homeowner. \n\nWhen I was in school we went over the importance of paperwork in the law. There was a case where a search warrant was issued, but the address was wrong. Police went to the wrong address, busted down the door and were shot at by an elderly man who had no idea what was going on. The elderly man shot and killed a police officer. Because the police raided the wrong house, and it was reasonable for the man to have been in fear for his life, no charges were filed. ",

            "Strangely something similar  this happened to someone I knew. Albeit it was in the early 90s. \n\nA cop who was not in uniform pulled his gun out. X thought the man was pointing the gun at him and shot the cop. Cop didn't identify himself and got shot in the chest. \n\nX was charged with attempted murder and a few other things and beat it at trial. \n\nMy personal opinion: under the law many states allow you to use deadly force if you're in fear of bodily harm. While cops are people, they're government actors. My state considers killing a cop or other government officials an aggravated circumstance that upgrades charges or allows prosecutors to ask for the death penalty. \n\nOther states don't have those laws. \n\nHowever if the cop is in uniform I think it's far more likely than not that you'd get charged with murder or attempted murder. \n\nAnd cops are likely to charge someone that shot a cop.",
            "Criminal justice major here. Although at the end of the day it's entirely up to a jury, in most cases this likely wouldn't even happen. In order for an officer to start shooting you, they need reason to believe that you are about to kill them or someone else, so the circumstances would require them to have possibly somehow lost track of a visibly armed person they were chasing after, find you instead and think you were them, then if they were trained well they would still tell you to stop or they will shoot before firing upon you. If this all occurred before you pull out your gun and fired on them and it was caught on their body cam, you would still likely be the one held accountable.\n\n\nHowever, say everything did not go down this way and an officer out of the blue just start shooting at you, and you not knowing that it's an officer, shoot back and kill them the likelihood would be that you would get off without any charges. But this would require some damn good evidence to prove. Which is why every officer should have a body cam.",

He died soon after. The officer was charged with manslaughter but acquitted because the Crown Prosecution Service asserted there was doubt that the assault is what killed Mr. Tomlinson. You can see the assault here (warning, obviously graphic): https://youtu.be/HECMVdl-9SQ?t=23  \n\nJean Charles de Menezes was murdered by British police after they claim to have mistook him for a failed bomber. He boarded a train wearing a light jacket. Officers rushed the train he had boarded, put a gun to his head and killed him. Later the Police force doctored a composite image showing a comparison between Mr de Menezes and the suspected bomber to try to make it comparable to Mr. de Menezes. The Metropolitan Police Commissioner's office was fined \u00a3175,000, together with \u00a3385,000 legal costs (taxpayer funded, he received no personal fine). No member of the UK police has been held responsible as the Crown Prosecution Servic claimed that there was insufficient evidence. It is interesting to note that the officers under investigation were allowed to write up their notes together - no criminal organization would ever be permitted this opportunity to align their stories.  \n\nIf you want to see a real-shit show read up on police collusion in Northern Ireland. Loyalist terrorists (who wanted the north of Ireland to remain part of the U.K.) were aided by the police. Police also, according to the independent Police Ombudsman Baroness O'Loan, ignored warnings about a bombing in Omagh by a terrorist splinter group opposed to peace. The Police service tried to have the report censured.  \n\nNo member of the police has ever been held accountable despite multiple independent inquiries finding them complicit in Loyalist murders."

            "Hi, psychologist here! The behavioural/attitude reason for this is a concept called in-group out-group theory! People are inherently social, and derive their self-esteem from their groups - people \"like us\" are \"good\", so people \"not like us\" are therefore \"bad\". This effect is worse when there's perceived competition over \"limited\" resources - in this instance, people are unconsciously competitive over the \"resource\" of internet attention/karma. The result is what you see! A post from another platform must mean that platform and its group are getting attention our group could be getting, so we must hate them! Or if they're posting content from Reddit, they must be \"stealing\" our content and therefore our resources! But conversely, it's \"okay\" for our group to \"steal\" from other groups because it benefits us and therefore must be \"right\". People in groups are so interesting!",

            "Here's my answer that I gave on another sub. Personally I dont really care, but I have an idea why. \n\nReason #1: Credits\n\nTwitter screenshots at its core, is literally credited at all times. Writing a tweet is no different than making a public statement with your username attached. Sometimes it gets in the news, sometimes in groupchats, and sometimes in other platforms. At all times, your name is there unless otherwise eraaed for privacy. \n\nContent here on the other hand, varies from memes, to stories, to actual artworks. People repost it without credit. Even worse some people setup bots that post every single post from a community to rake in all the likes into a single account. At worst, someone just blatantly claims that its their OC when its not.\n\nSummary: Twitter screenshots are **screenshots** that properly credit the user. Reddit posts are **content** that often dont get credited at all, and at worst are stolen with false claims of ownership.\n\nReason #2: Annoying Bots\n\nIts somewhat related to #1, but its so damn scummy that it deserves its own number. Its fine if various people repost a meme they like, but imagine just a single person posting literally EVERYTHING and then taking all the likes for himself.\n\nBasically there are some automated instagram accounts that just steal content from a specific community. Just imagine how infuriarating that is. People here are competing or working together to create stuff. Thousands of poster if not ten thousands, with only a handful of people in hot at a time. Then you have this bot who reposts and takes *all* of the creativity and genius of thousands of people and just shoves it into a single account.\n\nReason #3: Toxic Assholes\n\nSome reddit elitists just like to circlejerk reddit even when reposted content on other platforms get proper credits",

The people who want to be active on the internet, but hate things like Instagram, Twitter, SnapChat, and TikTok, come here. And when they see the platforms they dislike so much incorporating content that originated on Reddit, they perceive it as stealing (as if a meme is a singular object that has the capacity to be stolen from a platform and to no longer exist on it).\n\nI\u2019m not a huge fan of social media, for the most part. But I\u2019m on other platforms (Instagram, occasionally Twitter, very rarely Tumblr), and I don\u2019t harbor some weird hatred toward them. I think internet culture is actually quite cool because of how things move around and spread. I never learned the origin of most memes I\u2019ve come across. Like slang and colloquialisms, memes are something you just sorta pick up on as you are exposed to them.\n\nI\u2019ve never understood the isolationists of Reddit who want Reddit content to stay where it is. That makes for a less rich and varied internet culture, and also doesn\u2019t really encourage folks to come to Reddit.\n\nBut, that\u2019s just how things are.

            "Excerpt from Mark Manson's book \"The Subtle Art Of Not Giving A Fuck\" explains this very well:\n\n>In 2011, I traveled to Saint Petersburg, Russia. The food sucked. The weather sucked. (Snow in May? Are you fucking kidding me?) My apartment sucked. Nothing worked. Everything was overpriced. The people were rude and smelled funny. Nobody smiled and everyone drank too much. Yet, I loved it. It was one of my favorite trips.\nThere\u2019s a bluntness to Russian culture that generally rubs Westerners the wrong way. Gone are the fake niceties and verbal webs of politeness. You don\u2019t smile at strangers or pretend to like anything you don\u2019t. In Russia, if something is stupid, you say it\u2019s stupid. If someone is being an asshole, you tell him he\u2019s being an asshole. If you really like someone and are having a great time, you tell her that you like her and are having a great time. It doesn\u2019t matter if this person is your friend, a stranger, or someone you met five minutes ago on the street.\nThe first week I found all of this really uncomfortable. I went on a coffee date with a Russian girl, and within three minutes of sitting down she looked at me funny and told me that what I\u2019d just said was stupid. I nearly choked on my drink. There was nothing combative about the way she said it; it was spoken as if it were some mundane fact\u2014like the quality of the weather that day, or her shoe size\u2014but I was still shocked. After all, in the West such outspokenness is seen as highly offensive, especially from someone you just met. But it went on like this with everyone. Everyone came across as rude all the time, and as a result, my Western-coddled mind felt attacked on all sides. Nagging insecurities began to surface in situations where they hadn\u2019t existed in years.\n\n>But as the weeks wore on, I got used to the Russian frankness, much as I did the midnight sunsets and the vodka that went down like ice water. And then I started appreciating it for what it really was: unadulterated expression. Honesty in the truest sense of the word. Communication with no conditions, no strings attached, no ulterior motive, no sales job, no desperate attempt to be liked.\n\n>Somehow, after years of travel, it was in perhaps the most un-American of places where I first experienced a particular flavor of freedom: the ability to say whatever I thought or felt, without fear of repercussion. It was a strange form of liberation through accepting rejection. And as someone who had been starved of this kind of blunt expression most of his life\u2014first by an emotionally repressed family life, then later by a meticulously constructed false display of confidence\u2014I got drunk on it like, well, like it was the finest damn vodka I\u2019d ever had. The month I spent in Saint Petersburg went by in a blur, and by the end I didn\u2019t want to leave.\n\n>Travel is a fantastic self-development tool, because it extricates you from the values of your culture and shows you that another society can live with entirely different values and still function and not hate themselves. This exposure to different cultural values and metrics then forces you to reexamine what seems obvious in your own life and to consider that perhaps it\u2019s not necessarily the best way to live. In this case, Russia had me reexamining the bullshitty, fake-nice communication that is so common in Anglo culture, and asking myself if this wasn\u2019t somehow making us more insecure around each other and worse at intimacy.\n\n>**I remember discussing this dynamic with my Russian teacher one day, and he had an interesting theory. Having lived under communism for so many generations, with little to no economic opportunity and caged by a culture of fear, Russian society found the most valuable currency to be trust. And to build trust you have to be honest. That means when things suck, you say so openly and without apology. People\u2019s displays of unpleasant honesty were rewarded for the simple fact that they were necessary for survival\u2014you had to know whom you could rely on and whom you couldn\u2019t, and you needed to know quickly.\nBut, in the \u201cfree\u201d West, my Russian teacher continued, there existed an abundance of economic opportunity\u2014so much economic opportunity that it became far more valuable to present yourself in a certain way, even if it was false, than to actually be that way. Trust lost its value. Appearances and salesmanship became more advantageous forms of expression. Knowing a lot of people superficially was more beneficial than knowing a few people closely.**\n\n>**This is why it became the norm in Western cultures to smile and say polite things even when you don\u2019t feel like it, to tell little white lies and agree with someone whom you don\u2019t actually agree with. This is why people learn to pretend to be friends with people they don\u2019t actually like, to buy things they don\u2019t actually want. The economic system promotes such deception.\nThe downside of this is that you never know, in the West, if you can completely trust the person you\u2019re talking to. Sometimes this is the case even among good friends or family members. There is such pressure in the West to be likable that people often reconfigure their entire personality depending on the person they\u2019re dealing with.**",

It\u2019s a bit mean, but we put unrealistic time limits, over complicated tasks or whatever we think of, depending on the person and their skill set.\n\nNobody finishes in time, but if they\u2019re dedicated and focused on that time limit that\u2019s a big plus and we usually end up hiring those people. We\u2019ve only had one person see through us and told us that it simply can\u2019t be done, talked to us through the \u201cwhy\u201d and he has been working for us for 4 years now. I like this guy, no bs with him.",

            "an elder at standing rock said \"native is in your actions not your blood\"  thinking native is the only way to live that's not a sham.  The life you described is vapid because its designed by a bunch of busy minded neurotics who are afraid of their own thoughts.",
            "The trouble is that people don't set their own expectations of them selves and consistently manage their own growth/ evolution. The idea currently is that HR departments/ managers should be doing this but everywhere I go this is not happening. It currently costs too much to hire a personal coach and most people wouldn't anyway because of the stigma so everyone has to pretend they don't require personal growth. This is why the most success/happiness is seen with entrepreneurs, a life style/job choice that requires this level of responsibility and is not hindered by apathetic management.",
            "You sound a lot like me when I was in my late teens and early twenties. When I answer I might sound like an asshole or just way off base. Just remember your a surrogate for my younger self right now. Here we go:\n\nYou know all of those wants and needs you have?  \n\nYour interviewer has a set of wants and needs too. So does everyone you meet. If you can't show them through your words and behavior that you can fill those needs then they won't care about you.\n\nMaybe that sounds selfish and inhumane. But its quite literally how our entire society functions.  And if you really are like my younger self then you are one of the worst offenders. \n\nYou want things from people. You want a job, or professional contacts. You want them to fulfill your needs. But when they need something in return you don't want to reciprocate. In this case they need a likable and competent professional. \n\nThis runs WAY deeper than the supposedly evil capitalism some other comments are talking about. This is true everywhere. Take having a girlfriend or boyfriend. Why are girls/boys so petty and vapid? Can't they see that your true self has value? \n\nTo them it's not relevant. What matters is you're not fulfilling any of their wants or needs. If it doesn't look like you can do that, they will drop you like a bad habit and find someone who can. Maybe you think they are a bad person for that.\n\nBut you are the exact same way. You said in your post that you resent even talking to people you don't 'genuinely like' for networking. A polite conversation in exchange for some professional contacts is too much labor for you. They need to give you an emotional fuzzy wuzzy during conversation to make it worth your while. This is exactly like the interviewers you complained about one paragraph up. \n\n Someone who isn't able to perform basic social niceties, what you call \"faking it\", are major red flags in the business world. If you can't present yourself properly -- which isn't that hard to learn unless you have some unique mental situation like autism -- then it signals to everyone around you that your either incompetent or emotionally unstable. \n\nProperly identifying the needs of others and trying to fill them is literally how our entire society has functioned since we were monkeys that left the trees to walk the plains. Come to grips with it and you'll have an easier time of it at work.\n\nThe only reason I'm reaming you so hard about this is because you sound so much like my younger self that it HURTS.  I needed to be smacked around a little to get myself out of that head space. \n\nMuch love, hope things go better for you.",

The ones that say they don't are lying or delusional and simply want their ego and ass gently fellated differently than usual.\n\nThe people that say they want honesty are the last people that you should ever be honest with.  If they have to say it, they're trying too hard to make it be, or appear to be, true for it to be true.\n\nEveryone lies.   Almost everything everyone will ever tell you is a distortion of the truth or a complete fabrication.  This is even more true when they don't know that they're talking about, which is usually.\n\nYes, it's all about weird sex stuff and money.   Doesn't matter what it is, who is doing it or why they're saying they're doing it - it's very typically about sex and money.\n\nJust about anyone you'll ever meet will have no interest in you except for what they can get out of you.  This includes every single person you've ever dated, married, been friends with and definitely includes your family.\n\nLife is a volumatic interplay of transactions, and everyone wants something.   Some will give you sex in trade for attention, some will give you attention in trade for attention returned, others will do whatever it takes to give you nothing real while taking everything they can from you.\n\nSome transactional partners are much more worthwhile than others.   Some people are completely useless in every possible way because they give nothing and take whatever they can get no matter what.\n\nAltruism is your brain lying to itself about why you're really wanting to help someone else.  It's because you want to feel a certain way, and if you give that hobo a dollar or go out of your way to help that old lady shovel her sidewalk, you get to feel a certain way.\n\nIt's all just an exercise in pushing figurative levers in your brain  to get it to secrete the right combination of chemicals so you can feel whatever way it is that you want to feel at any given time.\n\nEverything you do is because you want to feel certain ways and not feel certain other ways.\n\nThe same is true for everyone else.\n\nSo of course you have to be fake as fuck and lie goddamn always to almost everyone almost all the time.\n\nAll they really want from you is to be left feeling a certain way as a result of their interaction with you.   Long term transactional partners want the security of being able to rely on that they'll get to feel certain ways for continuously interacting with you.\n\nIf party if that hinges on actions you take on their behalf or attention you'll pay to them or whatever else, it all comes back to the same basic premise \n\nThey want something from you.   Maybe you also want something from them.   Let the transacting begin.\n\nYou're on stage.  Don't disappoint your audience.",

You feel like you have to be fake because you are not always comfortable when somebody is not pretending to some extent to be what you want them to be.  \nIt's toxic and we all play a part.

            "\u201cThe real meaning of persona is a mask, such as actors were accustomed to wear on the ancient stage; and it is quite true that no one shows himself as he is, but wears his mask and plays his part. Indeed, the whole of our social arrangements may be likened to a perpetual comedy; and this is why a man who is worth anything finds society so insipid, while a blockhead is quite at home in it.\u201d\n\n-Arthur Schopenhauer \n\n\nIn my opinion all of our social interactions are performative. We don\u2019t really have a stable true \u201cself\u201d. We portray ourselves differently depending on who we\u2019re talking to and what setting we\u2019re in. And you\u2019re expected to behave a certain way or risk being ostracized from the group. \n\nYou can never truly know a person. All you can go off of is what they say and how they behave. You can\u2019t tell if they are being genuine or just playing a role. You can never know what\u2019s really going on in their mind. We don\u2019t even know ourselves.",

So you have to play to that in order to get into places and move up. You always have to look good on paper and say the right things.\n\nAnd I agree with some comments here that interviews should change. For my current job they asked me the typical questions then printed out some stuff for me to edit and rewrite. I was hired the next day.\n\nI do believe task-oriented interviews are of more substance than hearing the typical chatter. And I absolutely hate the mindplay questions like \u201cwhat animal would you be?\u201d or some obscure shit like that \u2014 it in NO way relates to the actual duties or any job.

Why did you come here for this interview today?\"\n\nPeople like to joke, \"Because I need a paycheck\".  There are tons of places offering paychecks, and probably still tons offering the same amount on the paycheck.\n\nWhat made you walk into McDonalds over Burger King?  Why did you apply to Google and not Apple?  You probably have reasons.  Your potential boss wants to know these things.\n\nIt's not fake to have a reason.\n\nI've worked in labour, retail, academia, sales, low-level supervision, and teaching.  I've never felt like I have to be fake, whether it's with coworkers, managers, trainees, customers, clients, or even students.\n\nMaybe I'm not making it anywhere in life, but I like where I am.

            "Think about it through the lens of evolutionary psychology. Your brain thinks you are a hunter gatherer and rewards you with joy for doing things that are good for survival.  \n\nYou are programmed to enjoy receiving information in the form of stories and from playing games, both of which are useful because they prepare you to survive in the future.\n\nMost people receive a deep sense of satisfaction from work and feel a deep sense of dread when they don\u2019t work, which is your brain\u2019s way of incentivizing you to do stuff that will keep you alive.  People also have an inherent need for relationships with other people because being alone in the wilderness is very dangerous compared to being a part of a tribe or group.\n\nBut your caveman brain doesn\u2019t understand the modern world. Your caveman brain thinks Internet porn on your phone is worth an ejaculaton. You know that there is not actually a hot naked girl in your bed, but your caveman brain doesn\u2019t understand. \n\nThe same is true for the sense of satisfaction that most people get from work and the desire for companionship. Instead of the feeling of satisfaction that you would normally get from work, you are accepting the feeling of satisfaction you get from accomplishing things in video games as a substitute. \n\nStudies have shown that your brain looks the same in brain scans both when you are hanging out with friends and when you are watching television shows with characters you know and like.  So you have excepted TV as an emotional substitute for real relationships.\n\nSo essentially, your life satisfaction is based on the mental masturbation of TV, porn and video games instead of actual accomplishment and actual relationships.  You may be willing to accept living the rest of your life with these substitutes, but you should at least understand that your satisfaction is largely based on tricking a primitive part of your brain into thinking that you are successful, virile and accomplished, when your frontal cortex knows the truth and condemns you for being the unaccomplished, non-successful, lonely person you actually know yourself to be. \n\nMasturbating to Internet porn is enjoyable, but it has nothing on actual sex. In the same way, TV and video games are fun and enjoyable, but if you didn\u2019t have them and where instead focused on accomplishments in relationships in your real life, you would be trading in shallow and fleeting feelings of joy for deeper and more meaningful existence. \n\nI haven\u2019t meant this post to be insulting and what I write next is also not intended to insult, though I acknowledge it may be hurtful to read:\n\nYou only get this one life and the clock is ticking. You can choose to spend it however you want, but if you settle for the substitute, mentally-masturbatory versions of happiness, you will have lived a meaningless and greatly diminished life.  Personally, I think that\u2019s tragic and incredibly sad. ",
            "Finally, a post I can get on board with ",
            "I left my last job, which I hated, about five months ago. I was given a payoff and I was pretty good money wise. I'd got to the point where I just didn't want to do what I'd done for 20 years, and the last job had robbed me of my motivation and belief. I had burned out, needed to recharge away from my profession, and away from people I didn't consider colleagues let alone friends.\n\nDoing nothing was great, at first. Lots of TV to catch up on, lots of video games to play, a world cup to watch and a brilliant summer to bask in. I chose when to get up, I chose when to go to bed. I could drink and not fear the hangover ruining the next two days, because the next two days was getting up at midday and doing nothing more taxing than having a bath.\n\nFive months later - that \u00a31000 a month rent has certainly dented my bank account. I've watched all the TV. The long summer is long over. The world cup a memory. My sleep pattern is wrecked. There's a growing realisation that time out has isolated me. I'm bored. I have little stimulation, and zero energy. Last week I left the house once.\n\nLeaving your job is fine, if you hate it. But taking yourself out of society is different. What lies on the other side grows  old very quickly. I need to reconnect but I'm in a far worse position now than I was before, and that motivation I lost has fallen even further down the back of the sofa.\n\nSo careful what you wish for."

            "I feel this 100%. Before I got into my current relationship I always asked myself: am I willing to give up my personal space and time to make room for this person? Because I really liked my life the way it was. Most of the times the answer was no. Then, I found someone who I could finally answer yes. I get my own space and my own time and I still *want* to spend time with them and share my space with them.  \n\nBest of both worlds. And we\u2019re getting married. \n\nMoral of the story: keep looking, don\u2019t lower your bar, keep doing the things you want to do, find someone who fits into what you\u2019re looking for. Not everyone will but someone will.",
            "Find someone that you can be \"alone together\". Where the silence isn't uncomfortable. \n\nYou will sacrifice some of your freedom, it's inevitable, but you will be happy to do so.",
            "Find a relationship where you still have space and freedom. They needn't be mutually exclusive.",
            "There are no rules as to what a relationship has to look like. You can definitely have a relationship as well as your space and freedom.  \n\n\nMy cousin (age 40-something) for example has been with her partner for over 10 years and have as strong a relationship as you would expect from any married couple. They each live in their own places and therefore have their own space. They can easily choose to spend as much or as little time with each other as they feel at any given time.",
            "I felt the same so I mentally designed the exact relationship I wanted, which to cut a long story short, was basically two day a week. For those two days I would focus on her/us and on the other days I wouldn't need to feel guilty about playing on the computer or walking with headphones or whatever.   \n\n\nAnd so I found someone that matched that. She's a carer for her mum and can't give me full time either. It's perfect. We never argue about the bins, we talk every single day and those two days a week are the absolute highlight. It's better to miss somebody than to wish they weren't there. \n\n\nSo the upshot is: decide what looks best for YOUR life then find someone who matches that and wants the same, instead of trying to fit yourself into someone else's requirements.",

Wouldn\u2019t be in my (awesome) relationship now without a LOT of therapy. \n\nAlso my SO was away a huge amount with work in the early years. Not gonna lie that helped. \n\nAnd he was just getting out of a bad marriage (with a narcissist) when we first hooked up, so he had reasons for wanting to take it slow. Didn\u2019t move in together full time for 5 years.",
            "The right relationship. My coworker has been with her boyfriend for 14 years and they don't live together, they're happy just seeing each other a couple of times a week. \n\nYou have the freedom to define what works for you.",
            "You got some great advice on this thread on maybe finding a relationship that works for you.\n\nBut there is nothing wrong with wanting to stay single-- you have reasons, and they're perfectly valid ones. If you truly love the perks of being single (space, freedom, etc.), you can have that without it causing you to feel lonely and unloved.  People in bad relationships still feel lonely and unloved.  So do people in good relationships.  \n\nThat is because relationship status does not cause those feelings.  Your brain does, and things like CBT and mindfulness can help you change the way your brain works.",

When your younger it\u2019s harder to grasp especially in early phases of the relationship (honeymoon phase). But setting an understanding in the beginning of the relationship that you need your me time and they will also makes the relationship that much stronger. When your together be together avoid phone\u2019s distraction etc. and be present. When when you need your me time to disconnect do whatever it is you love. For me I play video games a few hours on the weekends for my me time and my wife loves crafts. We don\u2019t Interrupt eachother during this time. Also find something you enjoy together for us this is golfing or hiking on a nice day, or binge watching Netflix.

They are just freaking out because birthing rates are lowering and they are worried about the future consumers/labor available for harvesting.

She/he should go out with her/his friends, and so should you (that applies to any activity really).\n2. Knowing how to be alone together. Just because you are sharing a space and time does not mean you have to interact all the time. Imagine, for example, being at home. One can be reading while another watches TV. That is called company. Good company doesnt always involve constant socialization.\n3. You say you feel unloved. First, is that to yourself? If you feel unloved, step one is learning how to love yourself. Step two is learning to love somebody else WHILE still loving yourself. \n4.

            "My guess would be that you have a dominant short-term look on your life and look at the long-run only from your situation right now. You likely also lack the conceptual tools to assess your total life expectations.\n\nWhat is constant in the short-term will become a variable in the long-run and vice versa. The main tool to assess the short-term is to take your situation now and extrapolate it. The main tool to asses the long-run is to imagine an endpoint and then recursively think back to the present. \n\nAlthough seemingly similar, the two are fundamentally different. When you think ahead, then there is always multiple steps that you can (or have to) chose with the three problems of (a) too many options, (b) too little information and (c) who and which way to prioritize. It therefore only works reliably for a few steps.\n\nOn the other hand, when you go to an endpoint and think backwards, then you always have just one step that came before the next. All you have to find is that one step. As soon as you have taken enough recursive steps, you reach the present and a plan unfolds.\n\nThe biggest endpoint is of course the end of your life. But there are multiple endpoints in everyone's life that can serve as milestones for recursive thinking: Buying a house, marrying, having children, children move out, passive income matches your salary, reaching pension age. etc.\n\nReligions work that way and provide their followers a template for all the typically important milestones, but of course it also works without spiritual angle.\n\nWhat I would recommend you to do is to make 4 lists containing:\n1) Everything you don't like/don't want in your life.\n2) Everything you do like/don't want in your life.\n3) Everything you already have to avoid/achieve (1) and (2)\n4) Everything you need to acquire to avoid/achieve (1) and (2)\n\nThese are the elements for your long-term plan for life. All you have to do now is to sort everything by priority, add milestones and see how the plan unfolds in the recursive perspective. Repeat this exercise every 6 months and as soon as you have a spouse, do it together and you will be rewarded with all that you want.",

But outside this time we function pretty much separately, I mostly read books and listen to music and he watches movies. We even spend most of our day in separate rooms, and a lot of time with headphones on, so it is also established that if you want to ask something, you need to come over and tap the other on the shoulder.\n\nI am not claiming that living with another human being does not limit your freedom, because it does. It is impolite to not clean after yourself, or play loud music, or make noise when someone is asleep, which is not an issue if you live alone. But even if that doesn\u2019t float your boat, you can live separately as well, you are the one who creates the rules here. \n\nRelationship should not resemble any form of social gathering or workplace smalltalk, where you need to be engaged and available all of the time.

            "There are two issues here. One, that as a single person you feel lonely and unloved. Do you have friends? Close friends? People you love in your life? Support and closeness? Those can't all be fulfilled by a romantic partner (and is way too much to put on one person.) If you are generally a person without a lot of deep relationships or full social life, that's where you should be putting your energy. Making friends and deepening friendships, learning how to be vulnerable and supportive in non-romantic relationships, and not putting the full weight of love and support on a romantic relationships. \n\n(For example, I have been single most of my life and have never felt lonely or unloved. Because I don't have family, so I have had to find supportive people and love outside of that, and also outside of romantic relationships.)\n\nI don't know *how much* you love your space and freedom. You can have some space and freedom in a relationship. In my relationships, I have my independent interests, I go out and do things on my own, I enjoy my time alone. It's called an inter-dependent relationship, not a co-dependent one. You maintain your independent selves, and don't rely on each other for all support, love, social life, and friendship. A partner should enhance someone's life and circle of people, not be everything. That means you have to date other people who also like space and time apart, and independence. \n\nBut you can't have unlimited space and freedom, and you can't be totally unaccountable to anyone for weeks or months so you can feel free. \n\nI am guessing that you haven't experienced a healthy, interdependent relationship, because you want someone to be your source of all love and closeness, but ALSO want to be free and have space. \n\nThere is a healthy medium. Therapy is a great place to learn what a healthy, interdependent relationships looks like.",
            "The true question is: how do you view relationships and these values in general?\n\nYou can have space and lots of freedom in relationships- you can be an individual, have hobbies etc. \n\nIf you mean freedom as in the ability to go meet other single folk for some hanky panky, then yeah you do give that up but it's not meant to be a sacrifice. You do it because you want to.\n\nSimilarly, feeling unloved and lonely isn't a good reason to jump into relationships. It's perhaps cringy and cheesy but you should want to be with a person for themselves, not because you want to have someone around or to prove to yourself someone fancies you. \n\nRelationships are depressing when you're only doing it to feel better about yourself. Those relationships tend to fail or become miserable due to the reality that you don't particularly like being with that person or there's no real sense of partnership.\n\nIn a nutshell: relationships are meant to ADD to your quality of life- not sacrifice your individuality or ability to do things on your own. Nor do they nurse insecurity or get your fix of human interaction. How you value relationships and these qualities will determine if you want a relationship or not, but don't start one if you don't actually like someone.",

A key part in finding a compatible partner is knowing your values and talking about them from the beginning. A number of people really lack communication skills. \n3. Being hot and cold will burn a relationship. like only paying attention to some one when it works for you and then going cold or turning into a hermit until you want connection again.  If you need space and don't communicate and just hermit you will come off as being uninterested and sever your connection. Instead tell the person you need space and for how long negotiate and communicate. \n4. If you are both emotionally mature you should be able to have a conversation around both your needs. Making regular time to check in with each other helps. Communication is key. \n5. No onw on here can tell you what you want. You need to figure that out for yourself or go to therapy.",

            "I see that OP discovered this was a prank, but there is a related thing.  I read about it in another post.  This lady called it a \"family cloth\".  Another commenter claimed the same thing, but they had a bidet so the cloth was only used to dry their ass after it was cleaned by the water.  I asked to clarify that everyone had their own butt cloth and she said they did not, there was only one that was shared.  That it was not necessary to have their own because their butts were already clean so it didn't matter if they shared.  She compared it to the same way bath towels are shared by a family.  Except they are not.  I would walk around with a wet ass before I shared a poop cloth with even the children I birthed from the same general area.  ",
