This makes it so the lionesses will mate with them instead of raising cubs from other fathers, but lions don't actually understand that. That's just why it evolved.\n\nMosquitoes carry a wide variety of diseases.

            "Many animals kill for \"fun\", but if you really want to attribute animals with some sort of higher moral standards than humans, you could say that they do it due to hunting instincts, or to improve their hunting skills. But then, that's what hunting as a hobby is about for humans too.\n\nNot to mention that when we kill flies because they annoy us, that's defense too. If we weren't annoyed by flies, we would let them sit on us and on our food, lay eggs under our skin, and infect us with diseases. So feeling annoyed by flies is part of our natural self preservation, defense instincts.\n\nOther animals kill flies when they can too. One of the reasons cows have tails is to fight flies. Not very efficient killing, but do you think the cow cares?\n\nWhile domestic cats do their occasional sport hunt, domestic dogs can be real nasty serial killers. My mother in law had some 30 chickens, 4 geese and some ducks exterminated by a German Shepherd (beautiful one) someone ditched on the road close to their farm house. Didn't eat any, just slaughtered them all. Many left half dead and we had to mercifully kill. Also tried to attack an employee's kid, and charged towards my father in law, who blew its head with a 12 gauge shotgun.

They commit murder because they are killers just like we have sociopaths in humans, same thing in chimps. \n\nThese are other examples but have resource reasons, not necessarily food.\n\nHippos kill all kinds of animals including infant hippos. They are super aggressive. They think that infanticide occurs because of too many in population.\n\nLions and some other male mammals kill offspring that are not theirs to bring female into breeding status so they can have offspring related to them.\n\nCuckoo bird lays it's egg in near of other birds and abandons it, chick hatches larger than other chicks, chick pushes out other eggs and chicks so chick can have all resources to grow from it's adopted parents. \n\nStorks will remove weakest chick from nest so that other chicks likely to survive, will have most resources.\n\nSharks in utero will eat siblings to survive so they have most resources from their mother and space and so they don't get eaten, same thing with baby garden spiders in their egg case.",

It\u2019s unnatural, and people can pick up on that; something rehearsed might sound unconvincing emotionally, or flat in tone, or spoken oddly quickly, etc.. You\u2019d have to be a good actor to pull it off.\n3. I realized a third thing.

Rehearsing and saying it to a friend, family member, or partner not always.\n\n Sure, important or meaningful things yes...but when irked or angry or up at 2am hurting my own feelings and turning it into a convo I would then rehearse wasn't good.

This is as easy as breaking open a glow stick and spreading the contents into your pits. This will produce longer results than bioluminescence, but ultimately it\u2019s still temporary.

            "It could be possible to isolate some bacteria from your skin and splice in a gene for a bioluminescent protein. Reintroducing it to your body would be the tricky part as your skin microbiota is there to prevent new, potentially harmful, bacteria from growing, but with a lot of cleaning and persistence it would probably be possible to reintroduce. Especially if you splice in another gene to give the bacteria a competitive advantage over the other bacteria on your skin, although that brings its own problems.\n\nThe problem would be keeping it restricted to your armpits, which would likely be impossible. Bacteria move and attatch to things, and would likely spread over most of your body with time after rubbing off on clothing, towels, etc.",
            "In 2009, scientists successfully used transgenics to genetically splice marmoset monkeys with the DNA of jellyfish, resulting in the monkeys to have bioluminescent feet. These traits successfully passed on to their offspring. Note however that hundreds of marmoset fetuses died before viable offspring appeared. As marmosets are primates, they are genetically similar to humans. Despite the current restrictions on genetic testing on humans, in is not inconceivable. Transgenic manipulation could theoretically cause the same affect in humans, but the cost in fertilized embryos could number in the thousands. If you wanted your own body to be bioluminescent receptacle, the most efficient method would be to modify a retrovirus to reprogram existing DNA through gene therapy, with could gradually modify your genetic structure to become bioluminescent.\n\n[https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/glowing-monkeys-promise-to-further-medical-research-scientists-1.795132](https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/glowing-monkeys-promise-to-further-medical-research-scientists-1.795132)",

            "I\u2019m surprisingly qualified to answer this! The short answer is it\u2019s hard. Yes there are many ways to make bioluminescent bacteria, but actually doing it to the microbiome in your armpits will be a lot harder. It\u2019s a diverse community. Additionally, the changes to those bacteria usually give them a slight disadvantage compared to the wild type organisms. Overtime they will probably be out competed. This is a common problem when using GFP expressing organism as a tracer in environmental research. The GFP expression diverts resources and energy so they get our competed by the un transformed bacteria.",

This would probably be the most difficult step, as lots of environmental microbes can\u2019t be cultivated.  For these microbes, engineer in a fluorescent operon under a constitutive promoter (always producing the fluorescent gene) on a plasmid with a resistance marker.  \n\nGrow up these cells in the presence of antibiotics, and inoculate them back into your armpit.  As soon as you inoculate these microbes, start taking a lot of that antibiotic.  \n\nAt this point, you\u2019ll run into a lot of problems, such as that long-term antibiotic use will drive resistance across your microbiome.  Additionally, since there\u2019s no reason for a microbe to keep the fluorescent operon, some will probably recombine out the operon in a way that retains resistance. \n\nIf the bugs aren\u2019t growing fast enough, they may also get washed out of the community, and the armpit nutritional levels may not support enough expression of the fluorescent genes.  To combat this, I would suggest washing your armpit in lysogeny broth, a bacterial growth medium.  These are some preliminary thoughts, I\u2019ll think about this some more and come back.",

You can download the gene sequences from the website and order the plasmids from the registry of biological parts!\n\nThe two best characterised bioluminescence systems (there are many more) come from marine bacteria and from fireflies (which is the one normally used in reporter systems like in the Promega link). We produced plasmids for both, including mutant versions of the firefly luciferase with lots of different colours.\n\nBut I'd recommend you use the bacterial system (originally from the bacterium Vibrio fischeri), because that includes genes that produce the fuel for the light emitting reaction. In the firefly system you would have to add expensive luciferin.\n\nWith the bacterial bioluminescence system, all you'd need to do is to transform the plasmid containing the whole gene cassette into a bacterial strain that can live in your armpits. Your armpits are probably as salty as the sea, but they are going to be a lot more acidic, so I would not imagine a marine bacterium would be able to survive there. As others have said, you could just smear some lab strain of E. coli in there, which would work for a bit, but they probably would not survive very long. Finding an appropriate strain and transforming it is not going to be trivial, but it can be done.\n\nThe biggest caveat is that bioluminescence is really very dim! It's evolved to work in the deep sea or in dark forests, so don't expect lightbulbs in your armpits. At a push, we were able to read a book by bioluminescent light, but that needed a dark room and a LARGE flask of liquid culture - all the photos on our wiki page were taken with long exposure.\n\nFluorescence would be much brighter and easier, but you'd need some blacklight source for that, it would not glow by itself.\n\nUltimately, if you had a lab and $100k, you could probably make glowing-armpit-bacteria. If you managed to do it with armpit-native-bacteria and used the Vibrio fischeri bioluminescence cassette, they should survive for quite some time, fed by your sweat and secretions. Once you have that culture, growing more of it would cost peanuts. Selling this to others probably requires all sorts of permits, but if you do this in your garage lab and smear it on yourself, its not like anyone would stop you (probably, dependent on the jurisdiction you live in).\n\nSCIENCE!",

This is important because bacteria need energy to do literally anything else, so any bioluminescent bacteria will probably be crowded out by the bacteria you already have in your armpits, or any armpit bacteria which happen to be floating around.  (And trust me, armpit bacteria are everywhere.)\n\nIf that's a little hard to understand, think of bacteria like gladiators in an arena, where they have to \"out-compete\" each other to survive and reproduce.

If you gene-edit resistance to some antibacterial drug onto your glowing bacteria and regularly slather your armpits with the drug, you could kill all the non-glowy bacteria (which don't have the resistance), keeping your glowing armpit culture strong.\n\nPlease don't do this, though; after a while some non-luminescent bacteria will pick up the resistance gene, and that's how we get superbugs.",

            "You would want to culture a swab from your armpits, select one of the more common species of bacteria, and splice gene sequences for bioluminescence into the genes of some of these bacteria, then culture them before reintroducing them, in large numbers, to your armpits, hoping that they can outcompete other strains of bacteria.  \nThere are CRISPR kits you can buy online, and I think some of them actually have guides on making bacteria/yeast bioluminesce. I'd start there, and swap out the yeast or whatever the kit comes with for the armpit cooties.  \nThat's just a rough outline, the actual process is more complicated. That said, you might be able to pull this off with a few online orders and a lot of patience.  \nIf you make your armpits glow, though, you might end up  \n  \n- Washing off the bioluminescent bacteria forever during a shower  \n  \n- Getting your armpit funk on all of your belongings and having all of your stuff faintly glow, like some sort of blursed night-vision  \n  \n- freaking out potential partners",

Mix your own.",
            "To me, the main issue here looks like getting the glowing bacteria to live on your skin and only where you want it to.\n\nMaking bacteria glow is a very solved problem. However, glowing is useless to the bacteria and costs lots of resources. If you remember anything from your high school/undergrad biology classes, then this presents the problem that your glowing armpit bacteria will be outcompeted by your natural skin flora.\n\nFortunately, we found a way to absolutely nuke every bacterial cell in your body: antibiotics. One could treat their armpits with an antibiotic that your glowing strain has also been engineered to be resistant to. This will prevent recolonization by other strains as being antibiotic resistant makes the glowing bacteria much more fit in this antibiotic-rich environment. \n\nHowever, you could still have colonization or infection by another resistant strain. Also, any bacteria can be dangerous if it has the opportunity to, and a skin monoculture could very easily become a skin infection (and this one would be antibiotic resistant.)\n\n\ntl;dr - completely doable, but rather dangerous\n\nEdit: I'm a bacterial molecular geneticist",
            "Yeah, you can do this. It would not be particularly hard to engineer the organism the issues start later. Most of the time the luminescent bacteria don't grow to densities where you can appreciate the light come from your new-found pits. Unfortunately, it is also likely that if you could have them grow to densities that are high enough to for the light to appreciate you would begin to likely smell very bad as well - as a rule, bacteria don't smell great. \n\nThe bacteria would also have to compete against other non-bioluminescent bacteria around it, and expressing those genes would be a penalty against the engineered bacteria, so you'd have to reapply to the area. You could probably use some sort of antibiotic deodorant to keep the competition out and the smell down.\n\nBut maybe you should just turn yourself into a pickle instead?",
            "I\u2019m pretty sure as it stands right now this is illegal because we would have to genetically modify part of you, probably by using CRISPR to put the relevant genes that produce the bioluminescent protein into your armpit.\n\nI\u2019m also pretty sure there is actually no reason why it can\u2019t be done; we\u2019ve already made a lot of glowing animals.\n\nUnfortunately as it stands right now you\u2019d have almost no chance of getting this done; human experimentation is subjected to rigorous ethics consideration, doubly so for human genetic modification, and it\u2019s very unlikely an ethics board (that approves human experimentation) would allow you to go through this, especially if it has no scientific merit and you just want to look cool.",

With the fluorescent protein route you could chose a different color for each type of bacteria! You'd be a hit at raves.\n\nNeat fact: The 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded for the discovery and development of green fluorescent protein. It makes it possible to watch what's going on in cells, in real time! You can make different parts of cells/other organisms light up in different colors, and then you can see how things move around and interact under microscopes with UV light.",

A lot of information we retained in school is not relevant or usable out in the real world.\n\nThe topics I'd focus on are:\n\n**- Learning, how to learn and retain information.** Learn mnemonic tricks and the structure of writing (government agencies and the military have a *great* blueprint for proposals and reports)\n\n**- Biology,** how does the body work and how do you keep it healthy.\n\n\\- **Running a household.** How to keep your place clean, how to pay taxes and how to save on taxes etc.\n\n\\- **Keeping a job.** This is where you start focusing on the kind of job you'd like to work, but also watch videos on what kind of work goes into different industries. \n\n**- Society, how is it run.** What government agencies do what and how are they controlled.\n\n**- Geography.** Get a basic understanding of the world, what kind of people live where and what do they make.\n\n\\- **History.** This is a fairly easy one.

Libraries have access to books, journals, databases, and - I think maybe especially helpful for you - online courses and tutoring for adults.  If your library doesn't have a resource at hand, it can usually borrow it on your behalf.  Some libraries are now partnering with higher ed to offer not just free GED classes or testing, but outright accredited diplomas and degrees as well as job pathways (trade, healthcare, business, IT, security, etc.) through the city/county government and their partnerships.

Stupidity is a chronic state of cognitive deficiency marked by an inability to perceive, understand or retain information. Ignorance is a flux state of misunderstanding due to absence or poor quality of knowledge.\n\nJudging by your admission that you had an insubstantial education, your recognition that your knowledge is insufficient, and your desire to rectify these shortcomings, it is obvious to me that stupidity is not your problem. Stupid people are incapable of introspection. \n\nSo the good news is you're merely ignorant. We all started off ignorant. We spend our entire lives filling in the gaps of our Ignorance. Most of us have the benefit of a structured education that provides foundational skills upon which we can build. \n\nI would consider literacy your greatest boon, because learning to read as an adult is exceptionally difficult, and it is a skill that is highly beneficial to mastery of many subjects. To other subjects it is nothing less than critical. \n\nYou can pursue whatever knowledge interests you, but I recommend bringing yourself up to speed on the information necessary to attain an equivalency degree.

            "You're getting a lot of academic advice, which is fair given what you've said about your background. I'm an engineering student so I'm steeped in academia and rather good at it, but let me assure you that academic talent doesn't make you less stupid. \n\n- First and foremost hone your attention span. Find an activity you like that's not gonna make you tune out like watching TV or doing drugs, and won't give you that ADHD length attention span like using the internet or gaming. Maybe get into guitar or painting or sports or something, it doesn't have to be super academic but you need to start by throwing yourself into a skill and sticking with it for as long as possible. I mean this on every time scale. Practice this activity for hours at a time, and sustain this practice for years. \n\n- Second, start reading a whole lot of books -- paper ones are good, get a kindle if you must. Audiobooks are insufficient for absorbing information (they're like chugging a book). You'll want the attention span specifically for reading and fully engaging yourself. Half the things I know which are worth knowing came from books, fiction included. So start there and progress onwards. If you haven't read Harry Potter yet, it's a good first series but there's a lack of depth. Here are some with a little more to chew on:\n\n- The Last Dragon Chronicles\n\n- The Kingkiller Chronicles\n\n- Lord of the Rings\n\nOnce you're ripping through those, get into any nonfiction that interests you. I strongly recommend you get your books from a library and get friendly with the librarians. A good librarian can learn your taste and might even set aside recommendations for you -- tell them you want to get smart and you'll garner some sympathy. Also, if you're reading enough for it to make you smarter, a library will save you thousands of dollars. \n\n- Become an excellent conversationalist. Whatever qualities of intelligence you're looking for, people who are ostensibly smart either have them or they are mere illusions. Expose yourself to all kinds of people and learn to communicate well with them. You'll be rewarded with information and insight whenever you end up in a truly good conversation. Many stereotypically smart folks are not great at this, but by being a good listener and asking questions you can learn so very much.",

Before you do it, think through what you think will happen. Then test those hypotheses. For every single thing you did, WRITE IT DOWN. Draw it out. Take (unedited, non-production) video and pictures. Look at every small detail, and then ask a new, related question. For every change you make, try to think of a control that doesn\u2019t change. \n\nDunno who said this first, but this is the essence of science: the difference between and experiment and dicking around is whether you wrote it down as you did it and thought about it before- and afterward.\n\nOnce you start to see themes of stuff you find interesting, start getting into more formal stuff. When stuff doesn\u2019t make sense, talk to people about it - preferably educated people. r/AskScience is an excellent place for help, no matter how esoteric your interest is.\n\nMost importantly, as you\u2019re doing all of this, prioritize SAFETY over sexy. Wear PPE, especially safety glasses or goggles (not just for chemistry, but physics, engineering, or even full-contact math). Put up blast shields, and trigger things with strings and sticks instead of fingers. Do things on a small scale first, and assume that anything damaging or dangerous on that smaller scale could be many times more so on a larger scale. Always assume things can explode, break, fail, or cause damage, even if you see them work \u201cnormally\u201d every day at home. Don\u2019t have any part of your body (or someone else\u2019s) in the way in case they do. Treat living things like they\u2019re living, not like they\u2019re objects, and don\u2019t cause them harm or pain if you can at all avoid it (even if that means not doing the experiment). As an aside, if you ever need chemical safety consultation, PM me anytime. I\u2019ll answer. I love safe science, and an IM is a small cost for me that could save a big one for you. Worth it, in my book.\n\nSeriously, though, you\u2019ll stick with an education that you find interesting. From there, you can find what you need in libraries and from reputable YouTubers.

Most of it at least.\n\nWith that out of the way, and always understanding that not every person has the same interest or focus endurance (but everyone has it and it decreases over time), theres two ways to learn something to the end: With motivation, or with discipline. Neither will get you anywhere alone, because pure discipline will burn you out and pure motivation is volatile af so, try to find things that interest you, learning it ways that engage you, and well, try to develop consistency one step at a time, always taking into account mental breaks (the pomodoro technique works for a reason).\n\nNow as to WHAT to learn is up to you, but if what you want is to \"appear smart\", feel that way, engage in deeper conversations and have faster reaction then I would suggest this topics:\n\n* Basic math (but own it, is incredible the amount of stuff we forget and how rusty we get)\n* Philosophy (it gets easier to discern and classify ideas and fallacies)\n* History (specially globally-relevant and the one from your country in the last say, 500-1000 years. You dont need to learn everything date-perfect, just understand what happened and more or less when)\n* Politics and economy (This one should be obvious)\n* Sports (football, soccer if you are in the US, is likely the closer to a universal sport)\n* \"Hobby\" (Now this ine is \"blank\" and could be anything from a deeper understanding of any of the previous to something completely unrelated - like say, metallurgy or  cooking or languages -  but it doesnt matter really the point is to have an edge over the listener and passion for it, this usually gives a good impression on the other person and help you find people that is actually interested in the same stuff that you and/or is able/willing to keep up with it even if not)\n\nNow as to WHERE to learn  any of the stuff (outside of recommending you subs like r/learnmath and r/languagelearning) im sorry but I dont have anything to offer to you, I could easily say \"go to youtube\" but sometimes theres errors or not enough depth, or say \"grab a book\" but sometimes even if not outdated they are awfully structured and have zero pedagogy.... thats likely the hardest part.\n\nAnyway, if you are serious about it, in 1-2 years you wouldnt be able to recognize your present self so, good luck!",

            "If you're dumb, this post would not be here. You're smart enough to know that you do not have the necessary baseline knowledge to function as an adult in the society, and would like to rectify that. A high school education (or something similar) will make you understand the basics to go along. Depending on your liking, financial state, and availability, you may choose to go to a career/vocational training center which gets you ready for a career. (Which is a great thing even many would frown upon). You may also go for a tad higher 2 year diploma, commonly known as a diploma/community college degree, etc. Then the bachelors/3 or 4 year program. With current trends and careers, you may learn about a productive activity such as 3D printing, web designing, graphic designing, etc.\n\nThere are a couple of things I'd like to highlight. You're never late. The best time to do anything is now. If you are willing, you will get there eventually. There are no such things as dumb questions, you're just not aware of things. \n\nThere are some services attached to higher education institutes to guide you by measuring where you are currently at. Colleges usually have counselors, and career guidance centers have a person to guide you through. There is no shame in asking for help.\n\nGood luck!",

            "Being uneducated does not make you stupid. It makes you uneducated. Where do you live? Do they have community colleges? Most community colleges have remedial classes in most things you would need for your GED or there are adult education classes in most high schools. You might know more than you think you know. Both options will also have testing to place you where you need to be. \n\nThere are many types of jobs where you do not have to have a High School diploma but having one opens doors for you. Computer programming if you have a knack for it is a field that does not require most of the skills you learn in high school. It does take an ability to do analytical thinking. Most hard labor jobs can be done with a lower level of education and you can learn on the job but your body will not last forever doing that and you need to train up. Again, on the job training. Far too many jobs now use education as a means of cutting down the size of the pool. It is the lazy way of finding someone who might have the skills for the job. 50 years ago you were better off getting on the job training over spending that time in school. That is no longer true. \n\nGood Luck in whatever you choose to do (and if you can move to California they have the best community colleges in the country)!",

Improve your diet, get more sleep, cut back on alcohol/drugs, and you may have an easier time using your intelligence.\n\nHowever, it sounds like your problem might be that you are ignorant, and not that you are stupid, which is a much more easily solvable problem.\n\nFind some sort of teacher or class and start learning. Get some books on topics you are interested in and start reading. Better yet, start writing about the things you are reading to help cement what you are learning.\n\nI'm assuming you are in the 15-20 age range based on a decade of home schooling? As others have mentioned, you could find some GED tests from prior years and use that to get an idea of what your current education level is and what you've basically taken in through osmosis from your environment. Find a class to prepare you for the GED and that'll give you a fairly broad \"here's some basic things kids/young adults are expected to have learned\"  but probably which won't be particularly useful to you at any point going forward.\n\nIf you are just looking to see what you need to learn to basically be a self-sufficient young adult and actually want to put yourself on a leg up from the average high school graduate, then (in order of how useful it'll likely be for you) find some classes or check out some books or start following some blogs on personal finance. Assuming you are in America, the public school system does a horrible job of teaching kids how money works and how to make sure you don't screw yourself over by making dumb decisions when you don't understand how it might impact you for decades going forward. Learn about credit, savings, how to balance a checking account (even if you never write checks you can still apply the same concepts to credit cards or just managing your bank accounts), and even how to invest. Bonus points, do some research into cryptocurrencies and try to figure out how they interact and influence national currencies such as the dollar. (Though definitely do a little research into investing if you are going to go down the crypto route; I got bit hard by the short term vs long term capital gains when taking my initial investment out a week before I'd held the coins for a year...)\n\nIf you are looking for skills that will get you a job, then find some classes on how to program. Since you don't really have a strong education in *how to learn*, I'd probably opt for an in-person class versus teaching yourself from a book or online, but you could always start out with the cheaper/easier method and see how it works for you. Just be honest when you assess if it's worth your time or if you would be better off with a resource such as a live teacher.\n\nAs others have mentioned, Khan Academy is a great resource for learning a lot of basics about pretty much any early subject, and it's probably worth creating an account and working through it. Your financial education will be a lot easier if you master some basics in math, and they even having programming classes and liberal arts classes such as English etc which can help round you out as an individual.\n\nBest of luck whatever you do going forward, and remember that there's a big difference between ignorance and stupidity. And, all evidence available (namely, the original post as I haven't read if you replied to any comments) is that you aren't stupid, because you recognized that you didn't have a particularly useful education up to this point and are actively seeking out how to better yourself.

About a decade ago I was in nearly your same exact situation.\n\nI found myself at 17 without much formal education past the 8th grade. My friends were in accelerated classes, graduating high school or finishing their first semesters in college and I was stuck without math, physics, chemistry, English, literature, history or much else except pop culture trivia. I was even sucking at taking care of my body and didn't have PE to kick my butt into something not resembling \"round\".\n\nMy story might not be exactly like your situation, it might be spot on, it might be way off, I hope it helps.\n\nI am not dumb but I sure felt like it. I've realized that I was (and still am unfortunately, but I'm working on it!) very under-educated. I was allowed to fall behind. In fairness, being a teenager without a lot of moral support, I chose to take the path of least resistance and allow myself to fall behind.\n\nI've gone through a lot of hate, despair, depression, and healing about my teen years. The neglect (which is a form of abuse), the shame, the constant feeling of being behind my peers all added up to make it really hard to even want to try to improve. I commend you for wanting to improve and encourage you to remember that desire.\n\nI enrolled in community college. As it turns out community college is a great place for filling in holes no matter how big they were. I took a lot of remedial math. I didn't follow a traditional degree program at first and instead took classes I thought were interesting and I knew I needed. I took physics, chemistry, psychology, history, a computer programming class, a couple of gym classes... I worked to make up for the important stuff I had missed.\n\nI dropped out once, starting again, took a break, and sometimes could only handle 2 classes a semester, but I got my high school-equivalent degree. I feel like I belong with the study group from the show Community when I say it took me 6 years of on-and-off work to graduate, but I did it! I've got the paper framed, it's hanging on the wall just outside my office.\n\nThere is hope! You have a hard, long, but very rewarding journey ahead. I did it and it's so worth it! I'm happily married, own a house, make more money than either of my parents did, have a good career, have no debt other than the mortgage, and are getting ready to try for kids. My kids will have a better education than I had. My kids will have a better home, culture, support system then I did. I have a lot of the normal struggles, and sometimes the old memories and ways of thinking come back for a while, but I've turned out alright :)\n\nI can't go back and change what happened, so instead I've learned to use my history as a strength to keep that desire to improve burning.

            "My recommendations:\n\n1. Research every single thing you find interesting. (typing in a couple search terms on whatever browser you use, and looking through the results until you find yourself digging deeper into a subject)\n\n2. There are very few stupid questions, so If someone is talking and you\u2019re just unable to follow what they\u2019re saying, find a moment where you won\u2019t interrupt them in an abrupt way and ask a question about 1 part at a time until you can piece it all together.\n\n3. If you need to expand on your vocabulary/grammar, look up synonyms to words when you have a feeling that the word you\u2019re using is close to what you mean but doesn\u2019t express the full emotion/intention you\u2019re trying to convey.\n\nI can\u2019t think of anything else off the top of my head and I have a ton of work to do around the house.

            "I can relate a lot to this. My parents did the same as yours, minus the letting me fuck around on the internet part, or at least from what it sounds like to the same extent. \nSo first, you will need your GED, as others have mentioned. \nI'm sharing this with you so that perhaps it gives you a different way to look at yourself, and address what it looks like you've already started to identify, that you'd like to change or improve about yourself. \nI was very sheltered growing up and emerged socially awkward and stunted. I knew I was missing a massive amount of social experience, and I wanted to fix that. I had always admired our men and women in uniform, was and am very patriotic, and so when I heard/read one day someone describing the military experience as them \"reprogramming you from a civilian into a soldier\", I said to myself well, if you are trying to overwrite code that doesn't exist, I guess it just gets added, right? So I joined the army, and served three years. \nIt worked.\nThe military was like a crash course not only in US based social interaction, but I chose Germany as one of my preferred locations, and ended up getting stationed there. So I had other countries, and even more opportunity to be thoroughly immersed in many different social situations from many different cultures. \nWhen I was honorably discharged, I started going to school, with the help of the Montgomery GI Bill, and those benefits helped me pay my way through at least my bachelor's degree. (I have two masters degrees now). \nI know it's (the military) not for everyone, but perhaps somewhere in there are some useful pieces of information that might help. Traveling, for example might be one of them. \nBest of luck to you.",

If they are, there could be, theoretically a link between better sleep under light for people with darker skins.\n\nMy two cents on it is that it doesn't matter much, and if it does, it could have more to do with eyelid thicknesses (since it can vary). So a white person with a thicker eyelid will block light better than a black person that doesn't.

            "It would be the same as chewing up the same amount of unsquished bread, assuming you chew both, but less fun, less yummy. Think about it \u2014 when you chew bread (one slice, one chunk, whatever amount) you are squishing the air out as you wet it with saliva, which starts the digestion process. Same amount of bread by weight, same stuff, just pre-squished. Will be harder to chew, moisten, swallow, etc, and harder to digest maybe, since it isn\u2019t as wet and broken down, but otherwise, no diff.\nDon\u2019t try this alone, in case you choke!",
            "I ate a whole loaf of bread when I was pregnant.  The poops the next day were dense!!!!",
            "Made bread one day with dead yeast (we thought it was still good) but the bread didn't rise so there was no air in it. Was super dense but still tasted like bread. Just different texture. Although I only ate a small amount of it because I have diabetes and carb loading is the same as loading a gun and putting it to my head. I might not die but if it misfires I will. ( fuck pharma for making insulin so expensive) ",

            "I tried that myself bit not with entire loaf, just one slice. You see, bread are fluffy and have air holes in them formed during baking. So, when you squish bread, the air holes collapses and you get a solid ball/slice (whatever shape you squish it in). The mass will remain unchanged and you will get same nutrition as eating entire loaf one slice at a time. No, it will not expand in your tummy either. While chewing, the same squishing action is performed by our teeth. So, in conclusion, you will feel same kind of bloated and full as when eating an entire loaf, slice by slice.",

            "You're just squishing air ouf of it. If it's just wheat-yeast dough wouldn't make much difference. Digestion might be a bit less efficient. Also depends how much water it contains or if you drink while eating it. If rather dry, it might make you feel a bit cramped. If it's whole grain with oats you'll probably get farty and have a not so happy time squeezing it out again.",

You would then get thirsty from the volume of fluid no longer circulating in your body and drink water, all of which the bread would absorb until it reached loaf volume, ending with you getting a stomach ache and probably vomiting ",

So as you eat anything bite by bite and chew it up as it passes down into the stomach the stomach has special acids that make the food come back together to its original state that way you can pass on into the colon and be processed. So all you're doing by smashing the bread down that small is bypassing what your mouth is going to do anyway and then once it hits the stomach it can just expand back into the loaf again.",
