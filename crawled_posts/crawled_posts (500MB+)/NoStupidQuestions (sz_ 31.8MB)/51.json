Some eyebrows have more knights then others but their job is the same. Protect the king and queen from prying tweezers and fingers. If knights fail in their task and the king or queen are plucked. The knight is cast out from the group often above or below the eyebrow. These askew knights are quickly dealt with by the great tweezers or fingers. If the king or queen is plucked they will be replaced by one of their heirs, the prince and princesses. And the cycle repeats.",

Because I didn\u2019t know any better, I thought for a long time that I actually saw this episode. I believed that I saw this episode for a long time until I finally realised that it must\u2019ve been a dream, since what I\u2019d dreamed couldn\u2019t possibly have been a real thing, even though the experience felt very real.\n\nEdit: I know (or think) it\u2019s not real cause at the bottom of the screen there was this blue bar going from 0% to 100%, showing how far into life Grover was. which doesn\u2019t make much sense in a Sesame street cartoon. The whole thing took place on a white background with no music. \n\nEdit 2: It probably wasn\u2019t him as a soul that I saw, I don\u2019t think I knew about that back then, I think it was him being born.

            "Memories are a weird thing. There are some people who will be told a story, and then years later they'll remember that story as something that happened to them personally. OITNB had a part that demonstrates that exact phenomenon when Barb and Carol both claimed they were the waitress in a story, when in reality it happened to someone else entirely.\n\nThe same thing happens with dreams. Some dreams feel more vivid, which is usually during the REM cycle. If the dreams are more vivid and feel more real, then as time goes on you may remember the events but forget that they were dreamt. It's completely normal! If it bothers you then you can try to keep a dream journal. It'll help you to distinguish between dreams and reality, and provides concrete evidence as to whether or not it's a real or dreamt memory.",

            "I've heard about this from others, but personally there seems to be a pretty clear innate distinction between my dream worlds and the real world. In some ways, I can't really put it into words: It's just a feeling and I inherently know that I am awake in the physical world. However, there are things you can do in a dream to help determine that you are, in fact, dreaming:\n\n- Try turning on/off lights: Do switches work like they normally should?\n \n- Try reading: Can you see actual words and numbers? Do they make sense? Read it again. Did it change?\n\n- Touch your face: Can you feel it? Does anything seem or feel unusual? Look in a mirror.\n\n- Look at your hands, take note of how they appear and feel. Now look away, distract yourself with something else and then look back at your hands again. Has anything changed?\n\n- Look at your watch or phone: Does the time seem correct? Again, look away, distract yourself with something, and look back again: Is it still the same?\n\nThere's lots of other methods you can use in dreams to help determine if it's a dream. Read up on Lucid Dreaming if you want to learn more - you can also learn to have lucid dreams and they can be pretty amazing.\n\nIn the waking world, periodically do checks here too in order to build up the habit. Odds are pretty good you won't remember to check when you're actually dreaming, doing reality checks while you're awake helps to ingrain the habit and you'll be more likely to successfully complete them when you are in a dream world.",

            "Yes. A few years back, I had about a week of dreams like this - but they seemed to have lasting effects after I realized they were dreams. I had a doozy of a nightmare during that time where I dreamed that I had been in a horrific car accident that severed my legs off. In the dream, I had the car accident and went through the hospital, the informing that I had lost my legs, a few days stay at the hospital, and then went home. I woke up from the dream not even questioning if I had legs, but horrified that I had lost them. I called for my boyfriend, who came to see what was wrong, and I realized at the same time that I had legs under the sheets. That's when I realized it was a dream and tried to move my legs. And I couldn't. My legs wouldn't respond. And I couldn't feel them.  Maybe the accident HAD happened? I started crying as my boyfriend entered the room. Cue very confusing conversation where he explained that I hadn't been in a car accident and my legs were working fine last night. He had to explain what had happened the night before for me to remember. I explained to him that my legs wouldn't work (with more tears), and he had to run his hands along my legs for me to realize that I could feel my legs, that they were real, attached, and mine. It took another minute or so for me to break out of whatever the dream had a hold of on me, and I was wobbly for the first half hour or so. \n\nAnother night, I had a nightmare that he had died, and I started crying in my sleep, which woke me up. I was 100% convinced that he had died, and started bawling. When he entered the room to see what was wrong, I thought he was a ghost. Cue another confusing conversation about what had happened in the last 2 weeks. \n\nThat was a really rough week. ",

            "I've been writing a lot about this recently, especially with the effect it's had on my past relationships.\n\nTo compound the problem, my memory is terrible, so events that happen in real life get forgotten easily. My mind then fills in the gaps with whatever narrative makes sense, and adjusts accordingly for logical consistency. Once details of these events are confirmed (photos, videos, other people's accounts), your mind doubles-down: if part of it happened, the rest had to have happened.\n\nYou start to see memories differently. You repress what you need to for the story to work after you forget the forgettable details.\n\nYears later, you start looking back and questioning parts of what happened, and if you did deep enough you can find tangible evidence that contradicts the story. I completely forgot I had witnessed my ex-fiance  kiss another guy until I found a sheet of paper I had written on detailing it.\n\nBut how do I know it actually happened? I don't actually remember *any* part of that, but I wrote about it years ago. Everything else I wrote down I can remember, but this one detail? No idea.\n\nSo then... what about when this happens to other people? What if they just forget something happened because their mind adjusted around it.\n\nWhat if what you think you dreamed *really did happen* but that one other person who was there just doesn't remember? And then your mind convinces you that because that one person, *who was there*, doesn't remember, that you *must* be wrong.\n\nAlmost ten years ago, I did a small hit of salvia with a friend, \"J.\" While we were in the high, our other friend asked us \"What's the longest word you know?\" J says \"... footlong.\" I start laughing uncontrollably, and a few minutes later we're coherent again.\n\nOur friends asked us why J said \"Fuck you.\" I immediately told them \"He said footlong.\" J agreed that he said \"footlong.\" They then showed us a video with J clearly saying \"Fuck you.\" J and I looked at each other and both agreed that he definitely said \"footlong,\" **despite video evidence**.\n\nStories organically corroborate each other when fewer people involved.",

            "Yes.\n\nI was 5 years old, living in a dilapidated house with a dozen other kids. My parents were stern, militaristic people, but they largely let us kids govern ourselves. My older siblings liked to harass me, so I spent my time in the forest behind our house. I was out hiking one day, a day thick with fog, when I heard crying. The girl I found was my age, but wouldn't say a word. I brought her home and asked my parents for help.\n\nSurprisingly, my parents were very compassionate. They took her in, called the police, and long story short, adopted her. She and I spent a lot of time together and became close friends. She normally wouldn't say a thing, and I would do most of the talking, but we were comfortable hanging out in silence. I was one of the only people she would talk to.\n\nI grew up in that backwater town. I remember how the trees would grow so thick that they would form bridges of branches over the roads. I remember learning to drive in my dad's old rusty truck, driving past the small building that had served as our school. I remember the movie rental store with the flickering fluorescent light and a cardboard OPEN sign in the window. All of the roads seemed to be gravel, and you had to get to the highway to drive on anything paved.\n\nOne day, when I was in High School, the girl (I think her name was Jenny) and I hiked out into the woods behind our house. It was Autumn. We found a hill overlooking a valley with a highway running down it. The sun had just sunk below the horizon, but it was still quite bright out. We sat in silence and sketched, her drawing the highway, and me secretly drawing her. I remember the sound of wind rushing through the trees, and a lone car driving up the highway to the East. I was worried about leaving my home behind.\n\nI remember the day I was dropped off for college. The dorms, the classrooms, everything was all built into this large glass-walled building that sat at the base of a mountain. In the opposite direction, it overlooked vast plains, spiderwebbed with roads. My mom struggled to hide her tears, and my dad was smiling, proud of me. I had never seen them that sentimental before. I hugged them and turned to the college.\n\nAnd then I woke up.",

So her parents had to paint her beautiful new red dress black for the funeral.

This roller rink was located on a hill outside one of the bigger towns in the area. I would reminisce about how great that place was.

            "This thread is old by the time I reply but maybe someone will see this. Lately I've been having dreams where I am trying to wake myself up and get out of my room, usually out into the hall or the bathroom. It will usually take 3-5 times to actually wake up, with various dream-signs that tell me I'm not actually awake. They also correspond with feeling like I have a fever when I do wake up (though after touching my forehead I don't feel hot, only some psychological feeling of hottness I guess but I still can't sleep with covers afterwards). My room was built is in the 70s and has no vents. Currently it's winter and very cold so I don't open my window. \n\nIs there any physical thing that may be causing this? And is there an affordable way to test for it? I googled things like carbon-monoxide poisoning but my symptoms don't quite add up.",
            "This happens to me all the time. Has happened to me for most of my life. \n\nAll my dreams are usually within the realms of realistic. I usually have dreams that just dream out the entirety of the next day. So when I actually do wake up I think it\u2019s the next day after. Some real inception type shit. \n\nOccasionally. Something happens that is outside the norm. For a long time I was always fooled by it. I truly believe such and such happened and sometimes wouldn\u2019t catch myself and realize after \u201cOh wait that was a dream.\u201d For the most part I got lucky when that happened. I would say something based off the conversation in the dream. They would get confused and I would find a way to change the subject. \n\nMy tip on how to deal with these type of things is to not question the conversation itself. Because I found that to be impossible. But question your surroundings. Whenever something fake happens in my dreams what usually is going on in the background gives it away. Whether it be the location your in or you recognize something is out of place. ",

She was a stand in for Sarah Michelle Gellar on Buffy, a stand in for Melissa Joan-Hart on Sabrina the Teenage Witch, and also stood in for other actresses in a few movies. \n\nWell... Lots of gay people in Hollywood. So my teacher had stories. \n\nWhen he noticed the bullies picking on me and obsessing over this gay joke, she decided to tell a story about how these four guys she used to work with were always calling other actors gay, and just being obnoxious about it. These guys were always acting like being gay was the worst thing a guy could be... \n\n... Then, at the end of the story she told us how they were so obsessed with other people being gay because it turned out they were ALL gay themselves, and three of them were secretly in a gay threeway relationship together. The fourth guy was the most obnoxious of all... And it was because he suspected the other three were hiding their affair from him, and he wanted to be in it. \n\nHe felt rejected, but didn\u2019t want to admit to being gay if his suspicions were incorrect. So he just became aggressive toward others, and continued lashing out with his friends at others. \n\nThen she would say the guy\u2019s name, and it was the same name as the ringleader of the group of people picking on me and others. \n\nSo then everyone in class started suspecting that maybe the bullies were all gay together, and they started being picked on by everyone. Eventually they just changed tactics and stopped using gay jokes, because it always backfired on them. \n\nI loved that teacher. She and I still stay in touch 17 years later.

The kid who gets bullied is often ashamed of it and will try to remain quiet if he gets hit. The child who gets a sadistic thrill out of bullying kids only enjoys one thing more than those primate dominance tactics and that's getting other kids in trouble. They live for the opportunity to see kids they don't like getting punished and if they can get a kid punished for defending himself it's just that much better, because it shows the bullied kid that it's futile to stand up for himself. So the bully hits the kid when the teacher isn't looking and when he gets hit back he wails and moans loudly so that the teacher \"catches\" the other kid in the act. Some parents and teachers are good at recognizing this behavior and punishing the bully. Others erroneously believe that it's easier to side with the bully and that that'll \"keep the peace.\" The reality is those teachers are bad at classroom management and will often quit or get fired.

Discipline philosophies vary widely based on geography, culture, funding, student age, and time period.  What a student experienced 8 years ago in middle school in Arkansas would be substantially different than what a 3rd-grade student in Austin would experience now.\n\n-Try to keep in mind the long-term outcomes the school is trying to achieve. The end goal is to assist all students in learning that violence, *almost*  always makes a social situation worse via escalation. To further this educational outcome, the school will implement natural consequences as appropriately as possible. If you cheat on a test, you fail the test. If you steal from a classmate, you need to make amends to that classmate, teacher (if it was done in class), or community (for example if it was done within a sports team).\n\nIn the view of the school, it doesn\u2019t dole out punishment. It implements the established consequences for negative behaviors. It is no accident that this exactly how the government enforces laws. If you break a law *even with good intent* it can lead to negative legal outcomes. The same will be true for schools because it is important that we educate all future-adults about how consequences work in the real world.\n\nNow, here is where I will emphasize again that things vary **greatly** between institutions. Administrators and teachers are very often more lenient on a retaliator than an instigator. Not always, not everywhere. But on average, the consequences for instigation, especially physical violence, is almost always more severe than those for retaliation, *unless* it was an escalation.\n\nLet me create an example: \n**Scenario 1** Theo is verbally abusing Hector. Hector verbally retaliates. \n**Outcome** Theo gets a moderate consequence and Hector gets a moderate consequence OR Theo gets a moderate consequence and Hector gets a minor consequence.\n\n**Scenario 2** Theo is verbally abusing Hector. Hector physically retaliates.\n**Outcome** Theo gets a moderate consequence and Hector gets a major consequence (for escalating to physicality, which is also how it works for adults).\n\nTrust me, I know this can feel unfair. I was bullied as a young boy, and I remember vividly how it felt. I also remember the mistakes I made because I physically hurt people when I was angry.\n\nI\u2019m thankful that from these mistakes I learned about the consequences of them **before I became an adult**.",

I've always been a chubby nerd, so I felt low enough on the totem pole that nothing I said to you could be bullying. But I also always had a lot of friends in school, up and down the social ladder, and it makes me wonder if by somebody else's viewpoint I was \"popular and successful\".\n\nI guess my point is, when you stand up to your bullies, I've found that word to be a lot more subjective than it was when I was living in it. I'm confident I was no bully, but I'm not sure the kids I had beef with were specifically \"bullies\" either. And as an adult, especially one who works with kids, the whole picture is a lot bigger than it is for the kids, and it is entirely possible two kids think the other one is a bully. \n\nBut I also felt the administrative sting of exactly what u/innoculousnuisance mentions. Multiple times I had schools try and cover their own ass rather than protect students.",

            "My experience was that teachers often knew bullies wouldn\u2019t stop, even if they stepped in.  As long as the bully was never obvious about it they could turn a blind eye.  This was because dealing with it was a huge hassle (paperwork, meetings, etc) plus often bullies parents denied or in one case encouraged it.\n\nWhen kids fight back, it\u2019s usually out of desperation.  It looks like the kid was a major factor in the fight even though he/she was just trying to defend themselves.\n\nSome bullies also know how to game the system or that they can get away with it because of who they are.  In one high school I went to, the bully was a top athlete and there was no way a teacher would risk the wrath of the town.  My other high school, the bully had rich parents, school did not want to risk that yearly donation.  Both these guys tormented lots of their classmates.  These classmates also had nothing the school wanted.  So when push came to shove (literally), the school would do the bare minimum or somehow find the bullied kid at fault. \n\nIt\u2019s all wrong.

I pull them to the side and have a talk about their actions (what would happen if they got in trouble anyway). The kid won\u2019t ignore the bullies and almost always reacts.

Admittedly they often don't teach that lesson well, but that is the thinking behind it, I reckon. \n\nIf you put this on the real world, and some guy starts on you in a pub, yeah you can fight them if you want but you are just as likely to get kicked out the bar and/or arrested for assault. A better strategy is to avoid the fight, especially as there is literally nothing to gain by fighting random people. \n\nOf course this isn't a great answer for a kid being bullied, as it doesn't solve their problem, but I suspect this is thinking behind it.",

            "As others have said, the zero-tolerance policy in most places is kind of the big factor.\n\nBut, we should probably ask what underlies that policy.\n\nSome here have said it's about school liability, and nothing more.  I don't believe this is the case.  I believe that's PART of it, but not the only part, and I don't even think it's the biggest part.\n\nI actually think the core reason we see such policies is the anti-violence mindset lacking any and all nuance that a large chunk of society adheres to.\n\nTo be clear, being anti-violence in a general sense certainly isn't in and of itself a bad thing.  Hell, I'd hope we're ALL anti-violence in a general sense.  I know I certainly am.  Solving problems without resorting to violence is obviously a really important thing, especially as you become an adult, that you're supposed to learn.\n\nBut, I think that a lot of people take this to an extreme that says that violence is ALWAYS bad, is NEVER warranted, and can NOT be tolerated under ANY circumstances, EVEN when it's DEFENSIVE in nature.\n\nAnd, I think that mindset is more damaging than (most) violence itself when you look at the bigger societal picture.\n\nI think the desire to strive for a society absent violence is a good thing.  Maybe we'll get there someday, maybe not, but it's a worthy goal.  But, a worthy goal is one thing, taking the world as it is RIGHT NOW and not how you WANT it to be is quite another.\n\nHere, and now, violence is a part of humanity.  Forcing kids to not meet violence with violence WHEN WARRANTED isn't a good thing in my eyes.  We are teaching them the wrong lesson: that laying down and \"taking it\" is okay, and I think we're doing this because in our desire to strive for that society absent violence, we're thinking that we can make it so right now simply by \"outlawing\" violence.  That's never worked before, so why do we think it's going to work now, especially with kids, who aren't fully-developed people yet?  We should instead teach them to never be the instigator (because if no one is even an instigator then, long-term, you've actually achieved the goal you want), and of course, how to determine when violence is ACTUALLY warranted.  I've got no problem teaching kids that they should look for any and all opportunities to avoid violence.  If an adult is available, you get them involved, for sure.  We should be teaching them that running away isn't cowardly, it is sometimes the very best option.  I'm cool with all of that.\n\nI think the policy needs instead to differentiating between offensive and defensive acts.  \n\nThe bully is the one that should be punished, not the bullied, that shouldn't be controversial to anyone.  In a case where you can't reasonably determine who was the offensive party then okay, maybe then both need to be punished.  But honestly, most of the time, an attentive adult knows.  They either SEE it go down, or have witnesses, or just by virtue of knowing the kids involved know what likely went down.  Let's empower adults to make that determination and punish accordingly rather than tying their hands with a policy that removes any and all judgment.\n\nMight it sometimes be unfair?  Maybe.  Might the wrong kid get punished at times?  Probably.  Might some kids even abuse the system to get someone in trouble?  I wouldn't doubt it.  But if that's the price we have to pay for teaching them the right lesson about when defending yourself is actually right and proper rather than the \"turn the other cheek\" lesson we're teaching them now - because turning the other cheek often just gets you two bruised cheeks - then I think that's an acceptable tradeoff.  Right now, we've got a situation where there's no nuance, and everyone is punished equally.  So we've ALREADY got a situation that is unfair, gets the wrong kid punished at times, and probably is already abused sometimes.",

I go to school in Asia, and this stuff doesn\u2019t really happen as often here. Name calling and teasing is a thing, but it\u2019s mostly lighthearted and no one really takes it seriously. There are definitely cases of violence, it\u2019s just not as common (in my experience). Even when something like this does happen, the schools strike down HARD. It would always result in a temporary suspension at least, sometimes even expulsion. \n\nThis is all in my experience and I understand it\u2019s different depending on who you ask but physical violence in school isn\u2019t as common here.\n\nNote: Bullying is definitely a thing here, it\u2019s just in different ways.",

I personally reported someone who was taking my food everyday SIXTY THREE TIMES, and not one thing was done about it. \nEventually a bunch of kids started abusing the box and some friends of mine started submitting teacher \"fan fiction\" smut and then they got rid of the bully box with no alternative.",

Most cell phone fight videos don\u2019t start until pinches have started being thrown and there\u2019s often a more complicated back story. \n\nIt\u2019s also about legal liability. The school doesn\u2019t want to be liable for injuries obtained in a fight between students regardless of self defense.\n\nEdit: as others have pointed out, teenagers generally don\u2019t know how to appropriately retaliate. Example: kid #1 calls kid #2 a loser, and kid #2 responds by beating kid #1 with a baseball bat. Kid #1 started the bullying. But Kid #2 took it too far and should absolutely be punished.",
            "I've noticed (at least where I went to school) that bullies tended to be people who already felt they had social power (ex: most common bully in my area was the white football player with rich parents) and the people the bully targeted were often those who were \"different\" (ex: the gay kid, the child of color, the one who likes to read...)\n\nIn order to truly stop the bullying the schools would have had to hold up a moral code that was more specific than \"we behave ourselves at school.\" They would have to take \"a stand\" by telling kids \"you can't treat that girl poorly just because she's not white\" thus taking a stand on racism, indirectly calling the bullies racist, and inevitably getting a shit storm from the parents who taught their kid to think like that.\n\nThey don't want to have to do that, so they enact a zero-tolerance policy under the guise of fairness when in actuality it's biased as hell but they can't be called on it because \"hey we're treating both parties in the 'fight' the same, we can't be taking a side!\" But it wasn't a fight it was a bully and a victim protecting themselves.",

            "I got punched in the back of the head and got a mild concussion. I turned around and pushed them. I got a week suspension and they got off free, even though there were 10+ witnesses",
            "It\u2019s that \u201czero-tolerance\u201d bullshit so school staff can\u2019t be blamed for making decisions.",
            "I walked away once. The principle called my parents to ask why I didn\u2019t defend myself. My mom and dad always said that everyone has more money than us so wrong and right don\u2019t matter.",
            "How is the school supposed to know who started the fight.  If you are a teacher and miss the beginning, all you see is two kids engaged in a fight which you now have to break up at risk of your own safety.  You also don\u2019t have the time or resources to play detective and figure out which kid is lying.  Punishing both may not be fair but it encourages the victim to try to deescalate situations or physically remove themselves.  It also encourages the victim to report their bullies to a higher up, which makes for an easier open and shut case against the bully.  If one kid physically assaulted another and the other kid never even fought back, there\u2019s no grey area.",
            "i always said fuck it and beat their ass. my mom told me to defend myself and she\u2019d handle it later. i still ended up usually getting longer suspensions than my bullies but that prob had more to do with my skin color than anything else...",
            "Because the current system doesn't like people who fight back for what is right.. even if it's defending yourself.",
            "When I was 8 I would, on a daily basis, be terrorized by a kid in my class and his teenaged brothers. They would occasionally beat the hell out of me. One day they were chasing me from the school, across a field, and the oldest brother, 15, tackled me from behind and all three jumped on me. As I was being punched, I finally snapped. \n\n I grabbed the nearest stick on the ground and stabbed the older brother in the arm, deep. They took off running and I was called into the principles office the following day, along with my parents. The boys had accused me of pulling a knife on them and stabbing the brother as they were heading home. My principle asked me if that was true. I told him no, and related what happened, as well as how long they had been beating me up.\n\n He told my parents that, due to school policy (this was 1981), he had to suspend me for three days. My father was pissed, but didn't argue too much. As we got up to leave, the principle reached out and shook my hand and said \"Good job son.\" He knew I was telling the truth, and what little bastards those boys were. I'm sure the fat lip and scratches on my neck and face went a long way towards helping his belief. \n\nI've never forgotten that. His hands were tied, he had no choice but to suspend me, or likely lose his job. He did what he had to do, but made sure I knew that he approved of my giving one back to the bullies.",
            "It\u2019s what people in power do when they only have the facade of power. When the victim shows they have power to defend their own person or dignity, those in power go after the victim. \n\nThis applies to governments too.",
            "I got jumped from behind in school and was beaten unconscious. I didn\u2019t do a damn thing to fight back (had been suspended before for fighting back). I still received a 5 day suspension. My attacker got a 7 day suspension. Always defend yourself, at least you won\u2019t be beaten into a bloody pulp",
            "I had a friend who got punched in the face and literally never even hit back and he and the kid who punched him got a Friday school. Why did my friend get a Friday school for never even hitting back? Idk. But it teaches us that we are both going to get in trouble, so we might as well defend ourselves while we are at it",
            "Not my kid. They get suspended for not being a victim they get Disneyland",
            "When my dad was in high school, he kicked his bully off a cliff. The guy tried to beat him up, my dad fought back, bully looked at teacher with tears in his eyes, teacher said \"You deserved that\", kid never bullied my dad again.\n\nMy mom also fought against her bully. My grandma actually went to see the principal (who was a total p\\*\\*\\*\\*, btw). My grandma saw my mom's bully elbow her in the ribs as they walked past eachother. My grandma had enough, so she told my mom not to take anymore shit from the bully. Days pass, bully sticks a needle in my mom's butt (she was jealous of my mom's ass because her boyfriend kept looking at it), my mom then slammed the bully's head into the lockers. Never messed with her again.\n\nThe way I see it, the best way to get bullies to leave you alone is to stand up for yourself.",
            "I never understood this either. Why punish the reactionary for standing up for themselves? This shit has built up to a confrontation, so the kid that finally cracked loose gets punished. Bullshit",
            "Because it's about money. Schools do not want to get sued for letting a kid fights back and both of them get seriously hurt. They would have to show in court they did not condone physical assault. Funny enough because usually it's the verbal bullying that really messes with kids well into adulthood.\n\nI grew up in a different time but when I was getting bullied in school, I made sure to take care of it outside of class and not on school grounds. A couple different knees to the groin was enough to stake a reputation to not mess with me or my friends ever again.",
            "I was bullied pretty much my whole school life and I still suffer PTSD with flashbacks, sweats, heart palpitations, tremors, afraid to leave my house, all the sort. I did go seek help with teachers which made it terribly worse, and they would find reasons to blame me like \"well, she has long hair and the other girls don't like it so it makes sense they would beat her up, spit on her face and smudge dirt on her clothes, and ofc boys are allowed to join in and punch her in the chest and head a few times a week\". Then the teachers themselves would tell the kids to ignore me because I am trouble, and later on call me names in front of the classroom. So I went to the police and told them I was being harassed. My homeroom teacher went bonkers, came into the classrom and told the kids to teach me a lesson. That's when I was the most scared(because they were hitting me, spitting on me, calling me names and stumping on my belongings) and I tried to leave the school but she caught me so eventually I snuck out without my coat and bag (it was winter and raining). I also filed a complaint with the education board (I don't know how it's called in english, but basically the higher ups that supervise the schools in a county) and that did jack shit, they just sent me a letter saying they investigated and nothing is wrong but nobody from there even spoke to me. So eventually I went to the local newspaper, I know, but I was desperate. A journalist went to the school and after that I never heard from her again....and the bullying calmed down. The teachers stopped rallying the others against me, and they stopped igoring the stupid \"complaints\" they had about my damn hair (which was the reason I always got in trouble). The kids tried to badmouth me but without support from the teachers it was easy to shut them up, I literally just had to answer anything and they would back off. Years later I accidentally met with some of my teachers and they apologised. I should have asked why they did it, but I wasn't ready for that conversation at the time. So, in conclusion, you need to expose them. What happened to me was esentially abuse from adults, the kids were also encouraged by the adult teachers. This is huge, and honestly I should have sued.",
            "Fr. I never really got bullied, but one time I saw this kid fighting one of my friends, and they both looked pretty hurt. I ran over and broke up the fight by pushing my friend away, but what did the teacher watching see? Did they see the fucking wrestling match with heaps of yelling, or did they see me pushing my friend away from the other kid and putting myself between them? Of course it\u2019s the former. My friend and the other kid got literally NO repercussions for the fight (apart from their bruises and stuff) yet I got detention for a week."

I for example can only use one specific variant of insulin from one manufacturer or I am unable to control my blood sugar. A drug cartel would not be able to guarantee that this is what I receive and minor variations would make it useless to me.\n\nInsulin is also temperature sensitive, it's \"long term\" storage has to be a specific temperature, kept out of direct sunlight, etc. This would make it a pain in the ass for drug cartels to transport and you wouldn't be able to smuggle it easily on a person in any useful volume. The shelf life in \"long term\" storage is also fairly short, I think my insulin expires after a week or two if not stored properly and a few months if it is stored properly.\n\nFor the specific case of insulin, it is not high risk enough to be worth a lot for smuggling and it had a higher probability of being useless to a buyer or ruined by delivery than normal illegal drugs. People wouldn't buy it and the profits would be low.",

This is one of the main arguments for drug legalization, in that at least if you buy heroin at a store, you know exactly what and how much you're getting.\n3.

After a year I made some friends, one of them was a Samoan woman, she always asked about living in Tijuana and joked about how little I payed for stuff. Well I learned that she had diabetes and she had been wanting to ask about getting her medication in Mexico. I finally approached her myself and asked her if she wanted me to do it. Believe or not she was hesitant at first I even had to do some convincing but she told me pretty much had no choice, the cost were eating her up. \n\nSo after a month she finally needed refills, she gave me a list of many different pills. After work I went home and went to the pharmacy to get her medication. Next day I should up with bag full of her meds. She had told pretty much everyone at work so there was a big group witnessing the transaction. I give her the prescription along with the receipt, she says her thank yous and looks at the receipt. She looked a little disappointed while starting at the receipt, that's when I reminded her that was the price in Mexican pesos what she owed me was about 20 times less. She first thought I was joking, so I repeated the figure she looked at me and said something like shut up. After assuring her again my math was right she burst out crying and gave me huge hug. After that I did that every few months she always gave me extra and would bring food all the time. \n\nFew years later she passed away from a different health issue. But I will always remember that moment, but at the same time wonder how many people in low wage jobs which shitty or no insurance at all are similar situation.

Phone cameras and common digital cameras have low focal length lenses, so that it can capture a large area. But low focal length also distorts your face in an unpleasing manner.\n\nExample: https://cdn3.dpmag.com/2017/11/004-Focal_Length_Comparison.jpg\n\nSo, the mirror is more accurate.\n\nEdit: It appears that I'm slightly incorrect. The facial distortion is due to close distance rather than the lens focal length. The higher focal length lenses basically allow you to shoot from farther away, from where the perspective looks more natural.",

In the mirror, you can see yourself making all the phases of your smile.  In a photo, you only see one frame of it, and so the picture is flat and emotionless, even though you're \"smiling\".\n\nHow many pics have we all deleted, because most of us looked ridiculous in the single frame, even though we knew that particular moment was full of hilarity or joy?  Meanwhile, the movie of that moment would have shown us all in a glorious light, living our best life.\n\nWe are not meant to have our lives captured in single frames, to be printed and placed in a book.\n\nEdit: Aww, thanks for the awards, kind internet strangers!\n\nAlso spelling",

I've always had really bad self esteem and self loathing issues, and used to have like a bad fixation with mirrors and cameras wher I would stare at myself in disgust until it made me angry. Eventually I got to the point where I would deliberately avoid mirrors for the sake of my mental health. I'm still miles from happy with how I look generally, but recently moved into a new place, and this post just reminded me ive been walking past a mirror seeing myself every day for months and not once stopped to stare in disgust. Some days ill even like see my reflection in my peripheral vision (you know that point where you can like make out a person's face, but can't really tell who they are yet?) and catch myself subconsciously thinking I'm attractive.\n\nI know this seems like a really mundane, small thing, and it kind of is, but its the first time since puberty that I've been even close to neutral about my looks and it feels nice.",

Most pictures taken indoors or with a flash with a phone camera will look like shit, same for in bright sunlight or at night. Diffused/shadow daylight is what you want.\n\nSecond thing you need to think of is the angle - you only ever see yourself upfront in the mirror, but your head is 3D and not every angle will look good in a photo.\n\nAnd yes, the focal length. If you\u2019re using a phone camera (wide lens) you need distance, if your face is small and in the middle of the shot it won\u2019t be too distorted. If you\u2019re taking a selfie while holding your phone you will look like shit.",

            "This is a great post, thanks OP.",
            "I\u2019m a professional photographer who shoots fashion. The front facing camera on phones is a wide angle 24-35mm lens which distorts the image, compounding the subject in the middle of the screen and stretching out whats on both sides. The best focal length for portraiture is 85mm which slims the face. Reality is 50mm lens and that\u2019s what you see in the mirror.",
            "I think it has to do with ego perception too. It's easier to like and appreciate your physical qualities when nobody is looking. Assuming you're referring to photos posted online, it's probably hard not to notice all of your physical insecurities if you believe that's all people are looking at. The subconscious can definitely be nasty with apprehending the opinions of others.",
            "\"ugly in a photo\" could mean a lot of things. If you look bad in a selfie, that could be due to using a wide-angle setting on the camera (the default for most cell phones), which distorts any object that's close to the camera. It could be the lighting, too. If you look bad in all photos, even ones taken by other people from 20 feet away in good light, it could be that you are not photogenic.\n\nIn either case, you can understand and change your approach to having your photo taken if you learn to think like a model. All people have good points and bad points. When you look in a mirror, you are only seeing one point of view. The camera sees you differently.\n\nTo be \"photogenic\", you present yourself in a way that maximizes the good and minimizes the bad, at the moment the image is captured. Some people do this unconsciously, but you can learn.\n\nAs another example, I once knew a young woman who, to be honest, was rather plain. Both her face and body were roundish, she generally looked kind of gawky, but in every photo she always looked vivacious and pretty. Her smile, her eyes, the way she held her body just made her come alive. I don't know whether she did anything consciously or not.\n\nFor me, the big problems are my a big nose and weak chin, and I'm very tall and large-framed. When other people take pictures of me, the camera is low so they see a lot of my chin and the size of my nose is accentuated -- the worst view of me. I noticed by accident that a very few pictures made me look much better, and in those, I had my whole head pointed down, as if I had been looking at the photographer's knees but moved just my eyes to look into the camera lens. I look better when I am slightly behind other people (even if we're all in a row), because that makes me seem less huge. I started making those adjustments whenever anyone takes a picture of me, and I look a LOT better in photos. In reality, I am sure I look huge to everyone, but I don't care.\n\nI don't know if you are handsome or not. But I do know you can do a lot to make yourself look better in photos with practice and by using a critical eye to discover your good points and make sure that's what's captured in the image.",
            "Lots of attractive people take bad photos. The angle, the moment, your face could be weird, your body angled badly. In the mirror you automatically give yourself your best side. \n\nI'd trust the mirror more than the a photo.\n\nTo prove, take your favorite celebrity and google \"bad photo of X\"\n\nAlso this is why modeling is a career. It's not enough to be good looking, you have to know how to take a good picture.",

Thanks for making my morning way more interesting guys. Some clarifications: I meant American accent, my bad. French people and Japanese people can be intolerant of foreigners trying to speak their language and not doing a good job. They see it as very disrespectful.

Obviously this is a traditional mindset not shared by young people of their societies, but its worth being prepared for how you might be treated.

Czechs just love that I'm trying and making an effort. Really super super positive. And my czech is quite not good, but no one cares at all they are just happy someone has learned more than 'good day' and 'beer.' Of course, nearly zero people ever study Czech and the country has tons of tourists. So it's easy to stand out in a positive way. \n\nRussians..... hahaha TOTAL opposite. I mean yeah there is some appreciation for trying, but Russia doesn't have a ton of backpackers like Europe, requires a visa, etc. so they have less contact with random English speakers and more contact with English speakers learning the language. And their culture is big on being well read, speaking well, etc. So yeah they take it really seriously. Many times I'd be going on in a conversation, quite pleased with myself, and I'd make some small mistake and get a lecture about how my Russian is shit! It's a weird place though, so as much as that sounds 'terrible' it's not really that negative. It's a quite blunt, even aggressive country all around so there's nothing particularly unusual about it. \n\nFor Spanish it's much more normal in that there seems to be general appreciation of the effort, but also sometimes a bit annoyed when it's tough to understand something due to me making some mistakes/not having a good accent. \n\nAll that said, I do strongly believe and LOVE how the US is quite unique in that it is VERY ok (in most places at least) for people to be speaking with an accent and that's normal AF. Even if people in various places are cool/strict about it, only the US has such wide acceptance (again, in many places, obviously not all) of people from other places. I mean really it's a big deal. No matter how great my Czech, Russian, or Spanish no one would EVER considered me Czech, Russian or Spanish (nor, my kids!), but in the US if you speak passable English most people would consider you American. This is very, very unusual and as far as I know only the US is like this. personally it's the thing I love most about my home country.",

            "A friend of mine spent some time in Gansu province of China, learning Mandarin and teaching English. When he got back to the US he wanted to show off his skills so we went out to an authentic Chinese restaurant so he could order in Mandarin and ask for some cool regional dishes he was introduced to. He didn't get more than a sentence out before the waiter's eyes go wide and he has to suppress a burst of laughter. My buddy asked him what was funny, and after assuring him that we weren't offended, he shared that my friend spoke Mandarin with a thick western accent. Gansu is far from the coast, and the village where he was living was kind of the cultural equivalent of West Texas for the US. So here comes my friend, a 6' 3\" pasty white guy, talking like a Chinese cowboy. Once the waiter realized that my friend thought this was funny too, he went back and brought out most of the kitchen staff to hear him talk. He shared a poem he learned and everyone thought it was hilarious. It was a great evening all around.",
            "No, it's actually way cooler because of how amazing it is that an American went out of their way to learn my mother tongue. In the tourism-focused areas of Portugal we are expected to know english because most tourists don't even bother learning a few common phrases in portuguese.",

So it evens out I guess, but many think their English is better than actual native speakers which pisses me off.\nBut either way, that's my experience.",
            "Absolutely. As an American living in Australia and New Zealand (decades ago) I found myself approached in bars much more often than similar situations at home.

That being said, I'm not gonna lie, it does sound rather funny when you hear someone speak Bulgarian with a foreign accent, most likely because they add a lot of enunciation where there isn't supposed to be any. Or speak such more softly than we're used to hearing.\n\nTo answer your question, in my opinion it doesn't really sound sexy or cool, but it definitely sticks out in a more neutral way.

When I spoke to locals in Hungarian they were like... *entranced*. Several explicitly said they'd never before heard their native language spoken with a foreign accent of any kind*.* That said, they *always* responded in English even if it was our first encounter so it was pretty obvious that my language skills were dismal... Nonetheless they felt moved that I'd made the effort and were delighted. Now that I think about it, it's possible they were less entranced and more confused?

So in groups, most of the time English was used, but in smaller groups or with just him, he was so eager to learn and understand the German language. It was a great delight for everyone to see him grow in this hard-spoken language with that more melodic tone of his mother-tongue. He was most eager to learn cussing, lol.

I don't consciously notice his accent much anymore (it's just something my subconscious expects and finds incredibly soothing) but everyone we encounter is absolutely enthralled. I've asked about my accent before and apparently when I'm talking with him I lose a lot of my southern drawl. (I first noticed the phenomenon in college when I had friends who loved listening to me talk to people back home because I sounded so different.) According to my boyfriend the standard American accent isn't really that notable in England. Certain regional accents may be more interesting (or annoying).

During the national anthem me and my girlfriend we got caught of guard when everybody stand up when the anthem started, we had our hands full with our drinks and food. We just kept sitting down, not really saying anything, but we immediately start to feel that people were staring at us, shaking their heads. It felt uncomfortable AF. When the anthem ended a lot of people in the stands just started looking at us, a full section of people just looking like we stole something, some of them yelled things, the lady next to me said \"what's wrong with you?\", one person said \"Please have some respect!\" among other things.\n\nReally made us feel really uncomfortable and unwelcome, when we didn't mean to disrespect people like that. lasted a couple of minutes but made the game feel awkward at the begging, i did learn my lesson and stand up in \"God bless America\" tho...\n\nIs it that bad to do that? Im not American.\n\nEdit: for the people sending ugly messages just to clarify it was my first game with GF i know i didn\u2019t express that correctly in my post. Also, the other times i went never got on time to the national anthem. I remember going to the old stadium an as far as i remember didn\u2019t get any shit like my last game. Im still curious, as i don\u2019t want to disrespect people. I don\u2019t know if that changes anything of my original question. \n\nSome of the messages i have received are ridiculous, borderline toxic nationalism. I didn't want to make a riot between Left vs right, or whatever it's going on in your country, im just an outsider, asking a question. Sort it out yourselves, i don't want to take part on this fight as the United States it's not my country, and every nation has some tense between people, im no one to judge what's going on, as this doesn't not affect my life. I was asking a question and got my answer, i will definitely stand up next time out of respect.\n\nEdit 2: people are going to my latest comments and replying that i kill myself, also a lot of unread messages about that are atrocious. Seriously people, i came here with an osbervation/question, i was left again with the same impression i felt in the game, you are into some North Korea/china/Russia shit. I don't know how can you even have to gut to critique those regimes when a simple question makes you so fucking angry that you tell me to kill myself, go back to my country (whish btw, im already back in my country), never come back. Im not generalizing, im sure there's plenty of sane people in America, but some of you are drinking that nationalism Kool-Aid no different from a dictatorship.",

We were at a basketball game at my campus, and when the National Anthem started playing I couldn't decide if I should stand up or not, and made a split second decision not to. 30 seconds and a few nasty looks later I realized I probably should have, but randomly standing up in the middle of it would have felt even more awkward, so I just sat through the whole thing. \n\nSo if I ever happen to be in that situation again I'll just stand up, haha.

Politely sitting there is probably what I would do in that situation. \n\nAlso it\u2019s constitutionally protected to NOT respect the flag or the anthem. It is illegal to ban flag burning for example. \n\nI think you were probably in a rich white community. At this point in time overt nationalism is a problem in that community so they were not realizing you are not part of their in group, trying to shame you into obeying their rules. \n\nIn short. No. You have no obligation to ever give any respect to the flag or the anthem. Especially so since you are not American.

Simple as.\n\nIt's not your place to judge their customs and decide that because something would feel weird *in your country* then you're not going to respect it while visiting. You can of course do so, but yes it's disrespectful.\n\nIt's different if a local person chooses to defy the rules because that's their statement against their own customs that comes out of an internal understanding of those customs. I respect an American's choice to not stand for the anthem but as a visitor I'd always prefer to do as the majority of locals do."
