            "Yes. English is a Germanic language but since French was the language of the nobility and the Norman conquest romance words entered the language as well. So the peasants who held the animals used the Germanic word for a cow and the nobility who ate it called it by the French word. I guess fish and chicken were also consumed by the lower classes so that stuck around for the meat as well.\n\nThe same goes for many seemingly double English words like the Germanic smell and the romance odor.",

            "You better trust that ass you are eating and know where its been. \n\nSTDs and More\n\nThe intestinal tract is filled with bacteria that are part of the digestive process; these do not pose any health threat. However, eating ass will expose you to any bad germs or infections harbored in your partner's intestinal tract or anal area. The CDC warns that \"rimming carries a risk of transmission of STDs including hepatitis A. There is also risk of intestinal parasites, like cryptosporidiosis.\"\n\nIn addition, the CDC cautions that \"immunocompromised persons are suggested to avoid performing this activity.\" So if you aren't in good health and have an immune deficiency (say from AIDS or chemotherapy), eating ass could put you at serious risk.\n\n-----------------\n\nHere's a rundown of some of the diseases you could be exposed to when eating ass:\n\nHepatitis A: Hepatitis A is a virus spread through oral contact with the fecal matter of an infected person. It affects the liver and causes symptoms such as jaundice, fatigue, and nausea. It is not a chronic infection, unlike hepatitis C. Hepatitis A can be prevented with a vaccine given before or shortly after exposure.\n     \nE. coli: This is a bacterial infection spread through oral contact with the fecal matter of an infected person. Its symptoms include diarrhea, vomiting, and intestinal bleeding.\n     \nIntestinal parasites:\nThese are microbial organisms that cause intestinal diseases including cryptosporidiosis, dysentery, and giardiasis. Symptoms include diarrhea, fever, and stomach pain. Again, these are spread through oral contact with the fecal matter of an infected person.\n     \nBacterial infections: If a person contracts food poisoning, the bacteria that causes it, say salmonella for example, will be shed in their feces and could be transmitted through oral-anal contact. Symptoms include diarrhea and vomiting.\n     \nOther STDs:\nIf the receiving partner has a rectal gonorrhea infection, it could be contracted by the active partner; gonorrhea can infect the mouth and throat. This means that theoretically a person with an oral gonorrhea infection could transmit it to the ass that they're eating. Other STDs that can be transmitted through oral-anal contact include syphilis and herpes, if either partner has an active lesion in their mouth or anal area. \n\nHIV Risk?\n\nFinally some good news: your chances of being infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, are pretty low while eating ass. The CDC reports that the HIV virus is not found in feces itself. And the amount of HIV that can be present in saliva is too small to infect another person, making mouth-to-ass infection unlikely. According to the CDC, \"There would not be a risk of HIV transmission unless blood was also transmitted between partners (such as if the performing partner was infected and had blood in his mouth).\" Or if the recipient was bleeding from the ass and the active partner had an open cut or sore in his or her mouth.\n\n---------------------\n\nPlaying It Safe\n\nYou can protect against transmission of diseases by using a barrier during analingus. You can use a latex dental dam, or make a barrier by cutting the end off an unlubricated condom and then slitting it lengthwise. Many people also use plastic wrap; although it hasn't been scientifically tested as a disease barrier, it does prevent the transmission of body fluids. For extra sensation, place a dab of lubricant on the side of the barrier that will go against your partner's ass. Hold the barrier in place firmly, and place your tongue against it to lick and probe their asshole.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIf both you and your partner are healthy, your risk of contracting a disease through analingus is probably pretty low. However, there is always some risk in oral-anal contact, and there are a number of diseases that can be transmitted through this route. You can make the act of eating ass safer by using a barrier between your mouth and your partner's asshole. ",

But the worst experiences, I do remember in vivid detail. \n\nEven those memories which are supposed to be associated with a lot of happiness give no pleasure, and they didn't, back then as well. \n\nIs it common apathy or is it something wrong with me?\n\n\n-\nEdit : here's a little more information about me to give you some context\n\n-\nI'm 22. I've gotten into a college and getting into this one is a pretty big deal. I've landed an intership at a well known company and converted that into a full time job. These are the memories which I think should make me happy. Especially because I always considered myself to be dumb and incapable of success. \n\nI've made amazing friends and had many happy moments with them. They all seemed amazing in the moment but when I look back, I forget the essence and they just taste like dough without toppings.\n\n-\nDo I  have anything to turn to when I'm feeling down? Do I not have a single supposedly happy memory which gives me a fraction happiness that I felt back then? \n\nI recognise happy memories. I understand that I felt happy back then. But I feel only 0.05 or 0.1 fraction of happiness as I felt back then. Or I don't feel anything at all. It's not about the natural fading away of memories but I think I just have a really shitty memory when it comes to remembering good ones. I forget the happiness I felt yesterday, even if it's some significant happy event that doesn't happen everyday. \n\nOne could argue that there would be no point in such a thing as we could always reminisce and feel happy forever. My point is that recollecting them once in a while(when I'm not at my best) should invoke something. \n\n-\nA core belief of mine is that having low to no expectations is the best way to live life free from disappointments. \n\nThis stems from my own personal experience with depression and suicidal urges. I'm much better now. \n\nBut my main fear is, am I slowly going down that path again or is it normal? \n\nI fear that when I get married or have children or see my parents die, I won't feel anything.",

If you define happiness by the amount of endorphins, dopamine, serotonin and other \"happy chemicals\" my most happy memory is probably being a bit baked and laughing my ass off at a dumb joke one of my friends told me and I don't even remember the specific situation. Or perhaps it was winning a particularly hard round in an online videogame or getting a nice Christmas present when I was a child. If you've ever done MDMA or cocaine that might have also been the \"happiest\" you've been without realising it. No shame in that, it's not a contest.",

            "Might be a long comment, sorry.\n\nOP there's a really big chance that you've disassociated yourself from being happy about happy moments because of traumatic experiences from your depressive past. Although you're okay now, you may have this subconscious choice of immediately thinking that \"happiness vanishes anyway\" because you've been at a point in your life where nothing mattered. \n\nThis is pretty common, so don't feel too bad. A lot of people try to not feel happiness because they don't want to feel the pain that \"**inevitably**\" comes after. They don't want to make friendships matter because the friendships might vanish, \"**just like before**\".\n\nThe truth is you're always going to be in pain. It's part of life and it's part of what makes things worth it. And most likely, whether you like it or not, you will feel these things at the deepest portion of your being because these things **inherently** matter to you. You love to be happy, you just don't want to feel how you felt the last time happiness was taken away from you. \n\nPain is inevitable, the challenge is finding something that's worth being in pain for (Bob Marley). Remember OP you don't need a party to feel happy. In a way, there's a sense of personal hysteria from existentialism. Because nothing matters, what you do matters for what it's worth. This life is all yours. \n\nI hope you feel better soon and I would love to talk to you through chat if you'd like. This is my favorite quote and I often lean into it when I think and question about my own happiness.\n\n *\"Even if I knew that tomorrow the world would go to pieces, I would still plant my apple tree.\"*   \n\\- Martin Luther \n\nLife is yours OP. Life is your oyster.",

            "OP, I think you should be thinking about happiness vs well-being.\n\nI've read some of your other comments about events that you feel should make you happy. But I don't agree that these events do that. I believe those events you have described are precursors to a life of will-being, which is a status flag a lot if people seem to use in place of happiness.\n\nBut it is possible to have high well-being and lower happiness. I would recommend looking into Will Schroeder's recent videos on the topic, I found them quite insightful.\n\nDon't pressure yourself into feeling an emotion because it feels expected. But based on what I've read, I hope that you are, at the very least, proud of yourself for accomplishing what you have so far. Keep at it.",
            "OP, how old are you?\n\nA lot of people's happiest moments don't stand out from the rest of the happy moments because they aren't old enough to experience any big, really happy moments, like marriage, landing a job and eating full after spending a few days hungry, etc.. sorry I'm not great with examples but you understand what I'm trying to say, right?\n\nEdit: a lot of people are misunderstanding me. I said OP might be too young to experience the big day, but I never said you absolutely have to have a big day once you become 25 something. Just because you are 27 or something and don't have the happiest memory doesn't mean you missed out on life.",
            "My therapist told me that it's easier to remember negative memories than positive ones because our brain doesn't want us to forget what hurt us.

They were simply moments where I felt loved and content.

Sometimes it's because the cafeteria at work served something that was good, often it's because a coworker helped me out (health care provider at a major hospital, so things are rough lately), sometimes it's progress on a video game, and sometimes it's just I got the laundry done.   \n\n\nAt the end of the week, which for me is the end of my work week (I usually work 3 x 12 hour shifts in a row), on the 4th day I take an extra long shower, bust out the nicer personal care products.

Very often it's just finishing the week and getting to play video games guilt free for a day, because I finished my work week and things aren't too bad in the apartment.

I had a night where I was extremely slammed with multiple incoming, outgoing, and coding patients. My manager himself came upstairs from behind his desk to cover for me. Another supervisor came to cover some things for me. 4 coworkers had to come to cover for me. I'm typically the one covering for them, but that night I was so busy I running the whole 12 hours. It should've been the worst night of the covid pandemic for me but instead it taught me to appreciate my crew much more. \n2. A coworker and I hung out. It the first time in 3 years I got to cook for someone else. I made a spicy miso ramen recipe that I've been toying with/theorizing for years.

It is definitely wise to avoid having unrealistic expectations, however not to avoid disappointment. If this is why you\u2019re doing it, you likely have some kind of trauma that you haven\u2019t fully dealt with. Possibly something that happened or kept happening when you were young that caused you to shut down in this way. I\u2019m no Dr. so take everything I\u2019m saying with a hearty grain of salt, but psilocybin could help you to deal with this if you didn\u2019t want to go back on meds.

            "I think that sometimes it is difficult to detach ourselves from the emotions of our present when trying to recall a feeling from the past.  I've been stressed and upset and trying to recall happier times to cheer me up, but recalling the happier time never lives up to original experience.  When you are truly happy, you have likely been complete distracted from ever other obligation or emotion in your life and sort of swept away to live in just that moment of joy.  When you are recalling that time, you may remember it being a truly joyful experience, but the memory of it just doesn't seem to sweep away all your current emotions.  That is fine and completely normal!  It doesn't mean you didn't truly experience happiness.  It doesn't mean it will never happen again.  Think about re-watching your favorite movie.  Its probably your favorite because of the surprise of the emotions you felt during your first watch.  You aren't really surprised anymore by the movie, but it is more comforting to watch it and allow a temporary escape.  Remembering a happy time won't bring you happiness in the same way as it did the first time.  Maybe it brings you comfort to just know there are happier times.",

            "I think bad events tend to leave more of a lasting memory. Happy events are often smaller single events that all lead to a great thing. For example, you got into a great college - I'm sure you worked very hard for it, and while you will have been very happy at the time, a part of you thought it was what you deserved and so the achievement of getting into the college wasn't really a single moment, even if that letter was a single point. Same goes for your internship and your job. If things you have achieved make you happy and proud, that's great, but the memory of the exact moment that it happened is less significant.\n\nI'm a little older than you and I have done some things that make me proud and happy, but I would struggle to point to a single happy moment, because most of my happiness comes from the combination of lots of smaller, seemingly insignificant, moments. \n\nI wouldn't worry too much about it, especially because worrying about whether or not you feel emotions properly is a surefire way to bring about some depression. Be proud and happy of what you have achieved and don't sweat the small stuff.",
            "This is my take on this, and take it with a grain of salt:\n\n\"Happiest\" or \"the biggest thing ever' is kind of hard to find when we are talking about feelings. You don't remember pain the way you felt it because the brain recreates memories, it not like a sensory theater. \n\nFixing on feelings while searching for a memory, at least for me, has always been sub-optimal. I would recommend to try to reach for feelings that result in happiness, because at the end happiness is not a single feeling, is a composition of many + circumstances. Go for satisfaction, proudness of yourself (that's another whole topic about appreciation of your own achievements), gratefulness, the perceived happiness of others (bonus points if you helped them to get to it).\n\nThe list could go on and on, friend, but the important thing here for me is that happiness is a result, you are looking in your memories for a point, try searching for the line and admire the gradient of color.\n\n(Apologies in advance, English is not my native language)",

            "This is normal. The human brain basically records negative events as a defense mechanism, in order to learn how to prevent it from happening again in the future. This why trauma sticks with people, and can manifest into PTSD. Sometimes it can be very helpful, and sometimes, it can become irrational or seem irrelevant.\n\nWhen things are going well, your brain is in normal mode, and it lets things come and go. It still records it, but not in an easily accessible zone. When you are stressed, scared, injured, embarrassed, jealous, etc, your brain will record it to a more accessible zone, and replay it repeatedly, so you can use that knowledge to avoid that situation again in the future.\n\nThe part about feeling dumb, and feeling like your accomplishments are not your own, or undeserved is known as imposter syndrome. Many people feel this way. A lot people with serious jobs, like doctors, scientists and lawyers, struggle with this. Even though they went to school, got good grades, landed a good job, maybe even have years of experience, they still feel like they have no idea what they are doing. It feels like they are just lucky that things keep working out. In reality, they are very smart, and capable. Its just hard to feel like it sometimes.

I know I had a childhood and if someone tells me about a story I\u2019ll remember it but I don\u2019t remember it on my own or reminisce the way a lot of people do. I don\u2019t have any solid clear happy memories that I can think of but I can tell you of events that were positive in my life that should have made me happy. I also remember events in my life where I knew I was supposed to be extremely happy or sad but didn\u2019t feel that way so I faked it. I don\u2019t know if these things are normal either but you\u2019re not alone.",

            "It's probably because it's incredibly subjective. I'm not a miserable person by any means, but if you asked me what the happiest moment of my life was, I'd draw a blank. Not because I don't have happy memories, but because I have so many good and bad memories, that I couldn't possibly choose the \"best\" or the \"worst.\" \n\nIt also depends on what someone means by \"happiest.\" If they mean when I got my life together, I'd say that it was about 2-3 years ago. If it's finding love, I'd say it was earlier this year. If it's about something of my childhood, well, I'd say it was when I got my gamecube I guess, but that's a bit more difficult to answer.",

            "Your expectation of happiness may be skewed. I think happiness is just being content and not being miserable, especially if you\u2019ve experienced hardships or depression or any sort of despair... the opposite of the aforementioned dumps is not some unicorn bliss, IMO, it\u2019s just not bad. There may be moments of actual bliss, but they\u2019re usually not ongoing for any length of time, so they probably wouldn\u2019t be very memorable (unless drug induced or something unnatural). However, apathy could mean depression as well. But since you\u2019ve experience depression, I don\u2019t believe this is your case. Have you considered talking to a therapist? About your topic in post and life in general? It may be helpful to you. I am an advocate of therapy for everyone, even if they have their lives perfectly together and are happy (or content). Just for reference (I\u2019m in my thirties), I have similar experiences but absolutely found immense pain when I lost my mom. It was delayed but it was bad for me, real bad. I experienced denial before grief. I also think that there will generally be a sense of joy in parenthood that may not be the ecstatic excitement that some suggest, but at least moments where you laugh your ass off and pause and reflect and go, \u201cWow, this is my kid and they are amazing.\u201d I have certainly found joy in children (not even my own), as there is something about their carelessness and goofiness that is truly incredible and heartwarming. Don\u2019t worry yourself though, OP, it sounds to me like you\u2019re just a normal human having a normal human experience. You\u2019re also young still, so as you grow older, hindsight does begin to change. I definitely can pinpoint happy memories in my youth (I wouldn\u2019t explain them as magical or anything, but surely notable), but in my case, I think that is also because I am now chronically ill & can\u2019t have those same experiences, at least not frequently or in the same way. Perhaps it\u2019s all about perspective.",

I've made an active effort to live a healthy life to combat that and it's slowly made the depression less frequent. And when I'm not depressed, I try to really enjoy the good times.

I read somewhere that in ancient times in places were a couple of rich guys made a deal they would do it in front of a slave or a peasant and then beat the guy half dead or half drown em so he'd remember that day in case the rich guys disagreed about the agreement later.\n\nNice things don't stick with us as well as bad things because we don't need nice things to survive, but we need to remember bad things so they don't wreck us next time. \n\nYou don't remember the happiest time, but I bet you remember the worst.

Happiness in high school and my 20s was the feeling I had being with people that really just made me feel good. Finding my way in life and whenever another piece of the puzzle fit into my life, I was happy. One of my best summers was 2001 when Eminems \"without me\" came out. That song always reminds me of how much fun that summer was, but not a specific moment.\n\nIt doesn't need to be a specific moment that makes you happy!

Going to the Pro Bowl with the special needs kids I work with. Taking a diff group of the kids to Tradition field to watch Tim Tebow play for the Mets minor league team, and catching my first ever foul ball at a baseball game(47yrs old) and fracturing my hand(hilarious and exhilarating). I gave it to my special needs daughter, I'll never forget the look in her eyes. Winning the gold medal while playing on a mixed softball team at Special Olympics. We came back from 9-0 to win 13-12. That was maximum excitement. A hole in one while playing golf with my wife and my younger brother. We were screaming like maniacs. Walking in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade in 2008 with even another group of kids was the ultimate. I was the guy up front holding the flag for the group. I was so glad that it was 22 degrees out and I had a ski mask on. I was crying happy tears for the whole two miles.

I was never religious too, which is a huge factor for people like us, I think. Getting attached to kids was a big change though. When my first nephew was born, I think I felt real love for the first time. Our whole dysfunctional/normally toxic family got a clean slate almost, and everyone was stoked and it brought us closer together. But life happens, people move away, and it would bring me back to my nihilistic self. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was this way for what felt like forever, same thoughts: \"If I get married and do the whole celebration thing, would I have to fake cry and shit?\" But I kinda just rode the wave and unexpectedly found my life partner and I think this has made me softer and less jaded.",

A lot of them have a very distinct smell when you first get them(not in bad way) and I always associate that smell with MechAssault on the original Xbox. My dad got some of the chairs from his work for free for winning award and I put one in my room to sit closer to the tv, and I had gotten MechAssault a day or two prior to that.

            "Hello there. I am a regular lurker. I just created this account because OPs story reminded me of some things I have had to deal with. So I just thought I'd share.\n\n/u/Cattrovert Your story sounds very familiar to me. It may be different for you, so feel free to ignore, but I will try to describe my experiences. Maybe you can use it. If not, I hope I have not wasted your time and I wish you all the best.\n\nWarning: This is actually just a lot of stuff that has happened to me as a \"young adult\", mainly considering emotional health. If anyone doesn't want to read about a random dude on the Internet spilling their guts and giving \"too much information\" (TM), better stop here. \n\nFirst of all, what stuck out for me in your story, was the fact you felt \"dumb and incapable of success\" and were talking about having \"no expectations\" as a way to live \"free from disappointments.\"\n\nThis is how I have felt for the major part of my life, especially as a young adult, probably from 10 onwards to around 25. I was also depressed and had suicidal thoughts, but never acted on them; just did a lot of really dumb stuff that probably could / should have got me killed.\n\nTo my great luck, at some point in my adolescence, probably around the time I turned 15, the more \"crazy\" streak went quiet(er), which probably had to do with a change in school and the end of me being constantly bullied. So I got into less trouble. I still had problems with drinking though, but didn't think much of it at the time. For me it was just how it was.\n\nFrom 18 to around 25 I had an active group of friends, most of them I knew from University and my hobbies. We often went to bars, the cinema, visited parties, just \"what you do\" (TM). A lot of socializing with a lot of alcohol. But I always considered it fun and thought it was good memories.\n\n...until it was over, and I was home alone. Then I was hit by anxiety, guilt, just horrible depressing feelings in general. These were the moments, when I was home alone, when I felt nothing at all. All the nice feelings were gone, and I couldn't for the life of me get them back. \n\nIt was as you described: No matter how hard I tried to evoke the positive feelings I had felt during that meetings, nothing happened. But negativity was always there: I could easily tap into that to \"fire me up\" again and get shit done / get out of my state of depression and angst.\n\nThis was really unsettling to me, but back then I suppressed it. And I used it to function.\n\nAfter developing actual problems with alcohol and finally quitting the drink for good in my late 20ies, I had the great luck of meeting two very important people in my life, who changed the way I looked at myself and made me reconsider what I had been doing all those years.\n\nI realized that all those \"happy feelings\" I had back then, while I was out and about, were not real, and had never been. It was just my extreme anxiety that kicked in and forced me to just put on a mask and play the clown. I didn't feel in any way \"strange\" back then. I seriously just thought that this was my personality. But in fact I didn't even know who I was.\n\nAnd here it probably gets a little \"too deep\", but bear with me . It felt very absurd to me too, at first. But in my case, I just in my mid 30es realized that I had experienced emotional abuse during my childhood, and that this was the major cause for my problems. I never felt that way until then, because I was never beaten. I had enough to eat. I had my own room. I got an allowance. I didn't feel abused at all.\n\nBut I found the comic \"Are you my mother?\" by  Alison Bechdel (I had read one of her other comics and liked it, so I also decided to read this one). I was floored. She just described all the feelings I had had in my childhood, of \"never being enough\" and just being a disappointment, especially to her mother. And how this led to a plethora of issues.\n\nIt dawned on me then that I had felt like a useless waste of space because of the dysfunctional relationship with my parents, who I felt expected a lot from me, and whom I never was able to please. I always thought that I should have done more, performed better, just \"gotten a grip on my live\". No matter how good I performed. It was never enough, I felt like a fraud, and lived in constant fear of rejection. \n\nI don't know if this fits your situation. Maybe it is totally different, and I am just going out on a limb. If this is the case, feel free to ignore this personal account. But if you see something of yourself in my story, I can only say that it has gotten better for me in some ways. But also not in others.\n\nAs to my feelings, because you asked if it could get worse: My feelings are mainly gone (which probably sounds dangerous, but actually isn't all that bad). So I don't really feel that much, positive or negative. But the crazy / negative feelings from my childhood are also gone, and that is a good thing.\n\nBut it also means I don't really experience that much joy. But on the other hand, if something negative happens it doesn't faze me that much either. It is all kinda \"leveled\". It just produces stress / anxiety and physical symptoms, but not to a point where I can't function. I just keep going, maybe need some \"maintenance\" during or after it is over. But usually I am good again soon enough.\n\nI know this probably isn't exactly healthy emotionally. But just in case you feel your feelings growing more distant over time, I just wanted to say that it can lead to where I am at. But it also can help to focus and \"get shit done\" which I was never able to accomplish when I was younger. And that makes me feel less like a fraud. So it may be kind of a double-edged sword.\n\nIf you are really worried, you could maybe talk to a specialist about it and see if they can help. Regardless of what you do: Best of luck and stay healthy.",

            "Oh god, that made me realize that I don't really cherish my memories either. I never really cared about this, but that's maybe because no one really asked me about my happiest memories either! I think I'm going into panic mode!",

            "This seems like there is a simple evolutionary explanation for this. Survival is best served by remembering threats and negative experiences best so that one can avoid them in the future. Most pleasurable moments are fleeting because they are very distracting from survival. \n\nSo don't worry about it. You are a creature formed and shaped by an evolutionary environment that didn't favor answering silly questions about \"your happiest memory in life\" with anything other than the gaining of a pair bond or the birth of one's children. Most of your life will be a slog to survive in a world where mere survival has become excessively easy. But don't worry, because life will come at you fast and be incomprehensible and difficult in other ways.",
            "My happiest memory happened when I was on mushrooms. Mundane life is mundane.",
            "Something similar happened to me some years ago. I was not able to recall the \"happiest moment of my life\" as I was a young college guy just hanging with friends from party to party getting high. \n\nBut I enrolled as a voluntary for a Special Olympics event and there, I enjoyed my happiest moment of my life (and it wasn't even mine). I was responsible for taking the athletes to the competition court and to the award event. In this type of events, all the athletes receive an award as the important thing is to participate  and have fun :).\n\nOne of the athletes was a little girl who was competting with grown up guys and girls on a race track. I took her to the track, she ran with all her effort and she ended in 9th place. I congratulated her and took her to the award ceremony. \n\nI started to notice that the girl was extremely happy and excited for her accomplishment and started to wave to the public. And then, really really far, was her mom, shouting her name as a true champion. The girl started to jump and laugh as she called her mom. They were having such a beatiful moment.\n\nAnd in the middle of all that, there I was. Realizing that true love comes in unexpected ways. A mom with full pride of her little girl and the girl making her mother really proud despite her condition.\n\nThe moment was not even related to me, I was just supporting. But there, I had my happiest moment of my life.\n\nFrom that moment, I learned that happines is related to the act of giving to others and not giving everything to yourself. Helping others will give you the happiest moment of your life.",

            "You probably won\u2019t see this since the thread is so old now, but your happy memories are almost always \u201csofter\u201d than your negative ones. You build happiness in everything that you do. Then you look around and realize things are pretty great for so many reasons, but there usually isn\u2019t one event that switched on your happiness. Sadness and fear are intruders who break up that happiness. It could only take one source of negativity to bring you way down emotionally, and it is usually easy to identify, which is why memories of these kinds of events really stand out. The upside is that most of your experiences are at least neutral, if not good.\n\nThe people who have very vivid \u201chappiest\u201d memories are the people who have experienced a lot of hardship, so that a positive event can really stand out. I\u2019m not saying that you can\u2019t have a happiest memory without extreme adversity, but it makes the memory stronger. \n\nWhen I look back, I can describe the happiest periods of my life but not necessarily the happiest events. For example the summer I spent as a lifeguard was pretty awesome. Nothing special happened, but I hung out with my friends at the pool every day and no one drowned. As a sadder example, the year before my wife got cancer was incredible. So many big events happened that I had worked towards for so long, and I should look back at that time as the best ever. It\u2019s overshadowed now by her diagnosis and fight, however, and I can\u2019t look back without thinking that it was growing inside her the whole time and we didn\u2019t even know. She beat it, by the way, and you would think that would be a super happy memory but it\u2019s more like extreme relief mixed with a grim reminder of our mortality. Get yourself checked if you ever have doubts about anything.\n\nThe good things are delicate, both in their experience and their memory. But they don\u2019t need to be monumental. Just be happy, if you can, and don\u2019t think that your happiness needs to impress anyone.",
            "There is a scene in Saving Private Ryan that is exactly about this.  You have to work into it\u2014then it becomes more vivid. \n\nTrust me, when you have a kid\u2014it will hit you like a sack of bricks.  Happiest memory of my life.  I never really understood a feeling so intense\u2014that one second the little kid was an \u201cidea\u201d and minutes later I would do anything for this little ball of person. \n\nDon\u2019t worry about this stuff.  It\u2019s normal.",
            "Same.  I think it's because 'happiness' is not what drives me.  When I think back, I remember lessons (usually hard lessons, so 'worst/unforgettably bad experiences' and accomplishments.  And my high points, which are many, are not high defined by happiness; usually it's accomplishing something difficult or achieving some goal.",
            "I've found that along someone about their favorite thing is less productive than asking them,  \"what kind of food do you like? What classes do you like?   Did anything stand out to you in that movie?  Was there anything about the book that you found interesting? \"\n\nAsking for a favorite makes them stop and have to compare things that may be very close.   But if you just ask them for something that stands out or is interesting, it's easier to come up with an answer..",
            "Is it that you think they're insignificant, or you're worried other will think it's insignificant?\n\nSociety for the most part values certain things much more than anything else. Love, Marriage, Children, etc.\n\nIf you say the happiest moment of your life was getting a high paying job, there'll be people scoffing at you and laughing. They don't think it's significant, and nobody will call them out for saying that.\n\nIf you say the happiest moment was the birth of your child, nobody would make fun of you (out loud). There are still plenty of people that don't care but they don't want to deal with the backlash if they say anything.\n\nReally you shouldn't value other people's opinion when deciding what's important to you. Someone might say playing Zelda: Breath of the Wild was the happiest moment of their life. Or maybe it was eating a full course meal at a fancy restaurant. Or seeing Nickelback live. Don't let anyone tell you your happiness is insignificant.\n\nIf it is your own feelings and not expectations put upon you, you should know this. If you want something, even if you're worried you won't get it, you should try. Failure in and of itself isn't a punishment to be afraid of. Sometimes there are consequences, like financially, but you have to weigh the risk and reward and do what you think will make you happiest.",

            "Heyo - I realize I am incredibly late to this thread, but I hope that this reaches you nonetheless.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am about 10+ years older than you, but I found a lot of what you have shared above extremely relatable. So, I just wanted to share from my own POV, my thoughts, opinions and feelings on this type of outlook. Also, I was sharing a lot more, probably some stuff I care not to share, so I deleted some before posting. Anyways, it all sums up to the below text. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have tons of pictures from all parts of my life. Memories I look back on fondly (high school, sports, theatre, marriage, first home, first kid, second kid), but they don't necessarily bring me joy. Because they aren't \\_here\\_. They aren't \\_now\\_.  Some people can get stuck in the past, some people focus on the future.  I have discovered that I am focused on being present now. I get joy in the things I do now, and focusing on that brings me happiness. I have found, that with that outlook, when I look back at memories, I can remember how much I enjoyed those moments, and they do make me smile. But when we are young, and ambitious, we don't always focus on what's in front of us. We worry about tomorrow, we plan for next year, we regret last year, and so on. And if someone were to ask me what my happiest memory would be, I can't say I could give a specific answer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut not everyone is like this, this is just my take. But this outlook can make enjoying what is in front of me that much better, or more painful, depending on the circumstances.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat being said, if someone were to ask me today what the happiest memory of my life would be, I'd probably say \"yesterday, today and tomorrow\" (ew, too poetic), because that's where my mind is. It took me a long time to realize this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYesterday it was watching my oldest try to teach my youngest how to ride a tricycle. Today it was honestly just snuggling with the mrs, tomorrow, I really hope it's winning the lottery (j/k no lottery on Thursdays, and I will forget to buy a ticket anyways). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn regards to this little tidbit here: \" Especially because I always considered myself to be dumb and incapable of success. \" Don't be overly hard on yourself, enjoy your achievements when they come, and then enjoy something else. You're going to fuck up, a lot. You're going to say the wrong thing at the wrong time. But you are also going to succeed a lot, and say the right things at the right time more than you will ever remember. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd in regards to this tidbit here: \"This stems from my own personal experience with depression and suicidal urges. I'm much better now.\" - I won't pretend to understand why you are depressed and had suicidal urges. I have walked down that path, and it's hard to get out of. It's also easy to fall back into. I'm not going to suggest anything now, but at some point in your life, if your health insurance will cover it, go to therapy. Don't wait for these things to return, for they are never truly gone. I waited too long to start therapy, mainly because of the stigmas around it, but it can be incredibly helpful, especially if you take the approach of \"for the well being of my mind\".\n\nLooking back to the above now, I realize I have probably been rambling for awhile. Anyways, there is a quote I can never remember, but it ends with \"growing into the person you were meant to become\". And I think about that ending a lot in regards to all things in life. All of my friends, and life experiences, the good and the bad, the times I've royally fucked up, and the times I've succeeded in the most grandiose fashion, it all boils down to the now. All of that made me who I am today. And in 5 years, it's going to look a lot different.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBest of luck in the journey ahead.",

Think of it as like the loop the loop hotwheels.

A typical ejaculation contains about 2 to 5 milliliters, so that means that about 0.02 mL of sperm are contained in the average ejaculation. Even if the tube that carries the sperm from the balls  to the penis went straight instead of looping around, this tiny volume would get lost and not come out.\n\nSo what if you could squeeze harder? Well, it takes 70 days for sperm to mature. So if you could squeeze the full volume out, then there would be a long period when you could not father any children, and most of the sperm you do squeeze out would not be viable.\n\nFinally, the other components in semen protect sperm from the pH  of the vagina as well as providing it a medium to swim in.",

So there are this two pigeons (a couple I assume) and they are always sneaking into my room and then sits on the bed. I thought they were like dumb and would scatter them away. So some days later, I found a twig in my bed. AND then is when I realized that these birds want to fucking make a nest in my bed. So I then threw away the stick and shut the windows and the balcony to restrict them.\n\nSo things were kinda okay but then after coming home, I found that I forgot to close the windows and one of them came inside and is comfortably sitting on my bed. And also my bed was like full of clothes, 'cause I was too lazy to sort them out. I scared the pigeon away, but then I found an egg in my bed. IT FUCKING LAID AN EGG. Why are these birds so dumbasses? Man, also I live in an area with nature and trees around it and out of all those wonderful places, you had to pick my bed. I didn't throw the egg away or anything, that was morally wrong as I thought.  So I put out a pan with a rag on top of it and the placed the egg on it and kept it in the balcony.  But the bird is NOT coming to it and is again trying to sneak in the room. I placed the egg literally next to their sight and still, the mama bird ain't even sitting on top of it? So what am I gonna do? Will the egg not hatch if this goes on?\n\nSo is there any problem that if I touch the egg, the birb won't accept it or shit?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT; These things happened in a span of three weeks btw, so it first came to my room in the first week, I found a twig during the second week, and the egg in the end of the third week (just yesterday)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT** \\#2: So I'm back from watching Detective Pikachu and boy RIP my inbox. And ALSO THE PIGEON FINALLY SAT ON MY READY-MADE NEST. I'll keep you guys updated with pics, for now I'll take a quick nap\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT #3:[So these are the pics](https://imgur.com/a/TqS2Mdi). And sorry for the quality and if the bird looks like a monster preparing to shoot lasers at me, I had to use flash.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***EDIT*** \\#4: Idk if anyone is here, but the bird laid two eggs as expected. So when I found the bird and the egg on my bed, I think it was gonna lay another egg but I scattered it away. And quick facts on pigeons on the way;\n\n* Sometimes the mama and the papa bird may share the time sitting on the eggs\n* Most often they egg two eggs, but not simultaneously (yeah I thought they laid two at the same time)\n* And as u/Kelekona said, they mostly nest in cliffs most often, so I'm guessing the apartment looked like a cliff to it?

            "PLEASE read this if you want my to hear my experience on a situation that wasn't the same, but has connections. I had a job in a yard for a general contracting company. One day, we had to remove a lot of old equipment and materials from a part of the yard that was in a pretty wild area. One of the things that i had to remove had a nest with eggs in it. The nest belonged to a mourning dove, which is a close relative to pigeon. I removed the nest from the stairs it was entwined in and placed it on top of a box inside some cat tails nearby. I doubted the parents would return, because i had uprooted and moved the nest about 20 feet, but i came back, and the parents came back and sat on the eggs and the babies hatched and grew up til they were old enough to fly away. I know this because I checked on them daily afterwards. I found out that doves have multiple broods per year, so maybe pigeon are the same, they also almost always have only 2 eggs per brood. So maybe it was hoping to lay it's 2nd egg and is hoping to be able to lay it's 2nd. If you can maybe find a place for it to lay both of it's eggs and then move it to a close enough place that they can spot it and they feel safe, then it may work out. Also they have a bad sense of smell and the old wives tale of you touching them once and they will desert it are false, from my experience.",

            "This thread is pretty judgement heavy.\n\nI don't go to Starbucks every day, but I occasionally go and know prices. I pay about 5-6$ for the coffee I order (either shaken espresso or a cold brew). If you went every single day and spent 6$ a day, you've spent 2100$ at Starbucks in a year.  It is more likely that people go most days, not 7 days a week, so you're spending closer to $1500. \n\nWhile I agree some spend irresponsibly,  for a lot of people, this might be their splurge or treat to themselves to get through the day. $2100/year could be a vacation, not a down payment on a house, and it's also not putting people into all the debt I see people posting about.",
            "Rich family or higher paying job.\n\nHowever, $7 per day, 5 days per week is $35\u2026 it\u2019s really not that much for an entertainment budget.\n\nIt\u2019s way too much for lemonade or coffee, but if you truly enjoy sitting around starbucks and it helps you unwind, it\u2019s a different thing you\u2019re buying and it\u2019s not terrible.\n\nI know people who spend an hour in a bar after work twice per week, and it\u2019s ~$20 each time. That\u2019s a terrible price for 2-3 beers, but if you enjoy the experience it\u2019s not terrible.\n\nThis is an exaggerated analogy, but paying $20 to see a movie when you can sit in the dark at home for free isn\u2019t cost effective either.\n\nBasically- the people who go to starbucks every day aren\u2019t buying coffee, they just like going there.",

I usually get a Grande iced caramel macchiato with extra caramel, and that comes out to like $8 something. Just a few years ago, this same drink was only like $5.
