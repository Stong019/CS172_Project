            "Assuming thats sound is a spherical wave and is attenuated following a 1/r\\^2 distance. The British channel is 33 km/wide. This means that the sound will be attenuated around 1E9 time.  With db = 10log(I1/I2) it means that the sound is attenuated by 90db.  So if you have 91 db in Dover, 1 db will remain in Calais (Well technically the closest point isn't exactly in Calais/Dover but you get my point). Assuming that the sound level at the sea-side is between 50-60 DB it would mean that a 150 dB sound in Dover can be heard in Calais.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecond question how many people do you need to shout. Assuming one person can shout at 90dB. The formula for dB is clear everytime you double the intensity you add 3 dB so 2 person 93 dB 4 person 96 dB 8 person 99 dB ---> if you want to add 60 dB you need to that 20 time, so around 1 000 000 people shouting in Dover are  enough to be heard in France\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT\n\nThx for the silver dear kind stranger\n\nThx for the gold dear kind stranger\n\nThx for the golden shower \n\nThx for the platinium",

I took a linguistics class in college that was pretty much all about this type of thing.

            "I tried to do it, and I think I could! I think why it becomes 'impossible' is because when you think of the sound, your mouth tries to mimic (like getting the throat involved) how you would normally produce/vocalize it and then it turns into an 'hmm' when you close your mouth. Sort of like your brain is filling out the sound that is supposed to be produced.\n\nThe way I did it was to hold my breath and let the back of my throat relax. And then I was able to think 'uhhh' while closing my mouth. I could do the 'mmm' thing mentioned in one of the other comments. It definitely took a lot of concentration though!\n\n(Sorry for the grammar, english is not my first language!)",
            "I can do it perfectly. No problem here...",
            "It's because you're probably very lightly saying  \"uhhh\" under your breath while your lips are open. If you are truly thinking it and not accidentally breathing out \"uhh\" while your mouth is open then it will continue in your head, but saying it under your breath while minimally acting out will change because you notice the different reaction your mouth makes when it closes. Uh can only be said with the mouth open and \"mmm\" so when you make that transition, your brain thinks \"uuhhhmmmm\"\n\nTry doing it while holding your breath, start with your mouth open, hold your breath and say uhhh in your head, then close your mouth while still thinking uhhh. It tends to work better. You might end up thinking \"uhhhhhhmmmhhhhh\" but I think that's because you're still thinking/anticipating the change.",

            "No I can do that just fine but other parts of my imagination fail. Like if I imagine a piece of paper, then imagine tearing that paper in half, the paper never tears in half, my brain kind of fights back and forth and forms a blurry combination of both. I also can't describe faces at all. Idk",
            "So here's something interesting. I can do the uhh but I can't do the umm with my mouth open... in my own voice. If I try and remember a song with \"umm\" in the lyrics, I can hear it just fine.\n\nThe plot thickens.",

            "Phonetically, when you do the \"uhh\" sound, you make the air pass through the mouth, producing something like a vowel /\u0259\u02d0/ sound. When you close your lips, it's created a nasal sound, as the air flow is forced to leave the pharyngis by the nose (/m\u02d0/). It's not psychological nor possible to have an /\u0259\u02d0/ sound while closing the mouth, but maybe some modified version of the bilabial nasal. The claim that is possible to get a hmm with open lips would actually be a confusion between a /m/ and an /\u0259\u207f\u02d0/ or /\u014b\u02d0/",

            "I think it's possible to do it because you're not doing it physically, you're just thinking. However, my theory on why it's hard to do it is that even if you don't notice it, you're doing the sound (like, even if at a really really low volume). When you close your mouth the air can only come out through your nose, and that causes a nasal sound.\nTherefore, \"hmmm\" and \"uhhh\" are the same sound. The only thing that differs is that the first one is nasal and the second is not, and that's why you have a hard time thinking of a vocal (as opposed to nasal) sound while you have your mouth closed.",

My neighborhood had a mini mart, so if I'm every extremely desperate and without a car and don't want to deal with deliver, I can walk the 7 minutes over there, but u don't go there usually since grocery stores have better pricing and more availability and variety.

The ride apps aren't the most cost effective. However grocery delivery for some people has been beneficial for time saving purposes and not needing a car to do it.

No way would I want to live in the city even if it meant a corner store was a 15 minute walk away.\n\nMore generally you try to consolidate your errands and plan ahead so you get all your shopping done once a week so you don't run out of milk or cigarettes.

            "Generally we drive, but there\u2019s a few things to keep in mind:\n\n1. Americans often do their food shopping in one large trip either weekly, every few weeks, or even monthly. That\u2019s why we have big American refrigerators and chest freezers. Daily food store runs are not the norm. \n\n2. In many parts of America, particularly the south, the heat can be oppressive. Over 40\u00b0C during the day for much of the summer isn\u2019t uncommon. Walking or biking can be difficult, especially for those with health issues.\n\n3. On the flipside, in the north the cold and snowy winter months can be brutal.  Average yearly snowfall for the UK is around 10 inches. New York averages over 50 inches. Vermont close to 90 inches. Again, walking or biking with that much snow can be difficult for some.\n\n4. Petrol is much cheaper here than in the UK, Americans are used to having a long driving commute or having to regularly drive long distances. Our infrastructure is even designed around cars, often with ample parking, many drive-thru services, and houses with garages and large driveways. A ~20 minute or so trip in a car isn\u2019t even something most think about. At least not any more so than putting on a helmet and hopping on a bicycle. \n\nNow, do keep in mind, America is a big place with many different cultural norms. The east coast can be a lot like Europe. Growing up in a suburb outside of NYC I was always within walking distance of a deli/bodega/market.

Corner stores will have some foods, but no produce, no frozen fries, nothing but typical gas station food stuffs.\n\nThe thing to keep in mind is how massive the US is.  Places like NYC where you have 3M people in a small space, there will be corner stores all over the place.

            "Since you could as the last person alive pick any place you want to live, your best bet would be a farm or any other rural home that has it's own basic utility systems that would be easy to maintain.\n\nIt is fairly common that farms have their own water source, and also waste, so you would just have to find one that has also either a wind turbine, or river/stream with a turbine for electricity, and then you are set for life as long as you learn how to operate and maintain the machines, and know where to go to pick up parts.\n\nInternet on the other hand would grind to an halt eventually, and it would be out of your control to keep it up, so best be situated near a big city, so you could fetch books, dvd\u00b4s,records, etc for entertainment and information.",
            "I imagine that the last person alive is reading this thread written 100 years ago and is trying to carry out all the advice you're giving here.",
            "Move to a farm that has the following:\n\n1. Solar power.\n\n2. Tank water.\n\n3. Strong fences.\n\n4. Fertile soil.\n\n5. Farm animals.\n\n6. Decent equipment.\n\nYou\u2019ll want to have a reliable diesel vehicle (petrol has a very limited shelf life) and make some trips back and forth to get supplies.\n\nYou\u2019ll want to learn first aid, farming, equipment maintenance and survival skills.\n\nGet all the books, video games, dvds, devices and spare stuff you can get, clothes that last, depending on your local weather.. oh yeah, you might want to avoid places prone to cyclones and earthquakes, and it would pay to have a back up lair in the city, somewhere with solar power also, and lots of storage for canned food items.\n\nIf a natural disaster hits, you\u2019re on your own, so have back ups.",
            "No on all counts. At least, not major infrastructure based utilities. You might be able to maintain systems dedicated for small scale electricity generation, water purification etc. You have zero chance of maintaining the internet because the power would go out worldwide. Same goes for cellphone towers.",
            "Watch the first episode of The Last Man on Earth to learn what to do. First step, go live in the White House.",
            "There's a fun short story somewhat on this question called [When Sysadmins Ruled the Earth](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7154200-when-sysadmins-ruled-the-earth). Plot: the only people to survive an apocalyptic event are sys admins who were working in hermetically sealed data-centers.",
            "No. You're just one person, and (from a physical AND mental health standpoint) you would get overwhelmed very quickly. Maintaining these fascilities successfully requires an absolutely MASSIVE network of people. From the operator pressing buttons in the control room, to the miner that digs up the coal, and everyone in between, the trickle down effect is just too great for one person to properly replicate.\n\nAlso, keeping these things running would quickly become pointless since maintaining a power grid for 100k+ households is NOT a worthwhile undertaking when your only concern should be yourself.\n\nAlso, you're the last person on earth. You WILL be the last human and humanity will be gone forever after you're dead. As the last human in existance, you should be spending time figuring out what you want to do with your time and how you want to leave your mark on this planet instead of working yourself ragged worrying about electricity and running water. Humans of old survived without them, and we're STILL digging up evidence of early human activity. Find something more meaningful to do- outside of basic survival of course. (For that I recommend you leg it to the library and steal physical survival guides.)",
            "No because the power grid takes thousands of employees to keep it running from the generation point to the low voltage that runs your house. Once the power goes out everything shuts down.",
            "I actually design water infrastructure. A small well (enough for one home) could be run for about 10 years before you'd start to need parts. You'd be better off to find a spring.\n\nMost city water requires a large team of people to operate. People just turn on their taps, but there are often dozens of sources, treatment facilities, valves, pressure monitoring, pumps, and metering. To operate it enough to get it even to one home would be a lot. Multiply that to other utilities and I'd say that a farm next to a spring (ideally with solar) would be your best option.",
            "Short answer? No not even close. Not remotely close. \n\nBetter, quasi useful answer? You'd certainly be able to survive fairly indefinitely depending on where you are when it happens and your physical ability. Assuming you have all your fingers and toes and such you'd have at least a couple of years of food readily available. Canned goods would be in ridiculous abundance in homes and stores. Eat fresh stuff first and quickly before it spoils then work your way down. Same for bottled water or sodas or whatever. \n\nThat buys you a lot of time to figure out the rest. You wouldn't be able to keep full electricity going to a city or anything so you'd want to get a generator or several. Gas would be easy to find too. That will open up options like refrigeration and keeping yourself warm in winter, though it'd be more practical to burn wood for that. \n\nKiss the internet goodbye. It'd be useless without others anyway. Libraries are still a thing and it's easy to find out everything you want to know. From atlases to how to fix cars and grow crops. Even a small library would have all of that. \n\nThe rest would be about moving now and then as resources dry up. Once the food runs out you'll need to grow and hunt your own. Not difficult but needs planning. As gas gets harder to find you'll move to another town and start over to keep the generator going. Every car would be available. \n\nAfter decades you'd have to get better at things. Tires will rot, houses will fall apart. But you'd be experienced at that point and could improvise. Your biggest long term concern wouldn't be losing technology, it'd be madness. We're social creatures and having no interactions would take a heavy toll. At most you'd have 80 years anyway. Second biggest concern would be medical. You couldn't operate on yourself unless you heavily researched and without the proper knowledge a cut could kill you. Part of your research in libraries should be on antibiotics and other medicines. Which to use, in what quantities, etc. How to make your own, natural substitutes, and so on. How to make a splint properly. \n\nOf course a LOT of factors can change all this. If you are in Siberia you'll need to travel to a more habitable climate or face unnecessary hardships. If you aren't near any water sources you'll want to be. You'll need a gun or bow (hunting, not defense so much). But again, you'd have at minimum a year of premade foods and plenty of vehicles with gas to get anywhere you want. Crossing the ocean would not be smart. You'd lose a significant amount of tech but you could still watch movies or play videogames, use a toaster, things like that.",
            "It's unlikely at best.  \n\nI'm an EE and I don't think I'd be able to keep a full hydroelectric powerplant running by myself for more than a day, and that's assuming it was already running and I didn't touch anything.  I could make a small generator that worked off a creek and would let people charge their USB devices -- at least until I ran out of voltage regulators. \n\nThe Internet would eventually break down because the domain records would expire, the computers hosting everything would run out of power (I touched something, sorry...) or break down.  (fan failures, drive crashes, rats, etc.) \n\nMobile phones also require the power for the tower.  If there were a few people, we could set up some radios to chat, but that's about it.

            "Not a chance.  All of those things would fail because there's squads of people with skillsets keeping them going.  The internet and cellphones first, probably, power a close second.\n\nThe water would last a while because there's a fair amount of water in the system, but everything else would fail pretty quickly.  Gas pipes would last for a while too for similar reasons.  There will be bottled gas and water to be scavenged, so you're not going to need to worry too much about them initially.  As all the doctors are dead, it would be wise to switch to bottled water if there's even a suspicion of contamination.\n\nYour best bet would be to scavenge solar panels and batteries and get your own local system going to cover your needs.  For the first couple of days, though, start shit off downloading, then go find a generator or two, plus some gas in case your local power is what gives out first.  What you should do immediately is download [Trinity Rescue Kit](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/trinity_rescue_kit.html) and [John the Ripper](https://www.openwall.com/john/) and some dvd burning software before the internet runs out of gas and fails.  This will allow you to scavenge local windows machines and crack the passwords to gain entry and see what you have.  This and libraries will be all the information that you ever have.  Your first day/s of being alone in your Brave New World should be spent downloading the shit out of anything that might be useful on the internet because that shit's going away and isn't coming back.  For comms, you want to look up where there might be ham radio gear.  Find a couple of clubs and their street address for future raiding.  You don't have to worry about films, nusic and porn because you will be able to scavenge a shitload of that from machines you get from local towns.  You can download Wikipedia, so you should do that...it contains an awful lot of stuff you will need at some point but aren't thinking about now.",

After awhile he becomes super lonely so decides he's going to learn how to clone humanity. But first he needs the parts, but to get to the parts he has to learn how to fly but to learn how to fly he needs instructional videos, but to watch those he needs electricity etc. He's learning througjout the whole film, it's basically a fetch quest. But there are twists and turns and dangers and serbacks bla bla bla. Until finally as an old man he sets up an automated cloning facility by himself with the resources to produce millions of people, raising them in the facility, and giving them a future. Then there might be two endings. He has a heart attack before he even gets to meet one of his children, this new humanity. Or some hippies roll up and ask what he's doing with all this junk revealing that most of humanity had survived and he would have known about it if he had just turned on a radio. Idk there's lots of plot holes but with a bit of polish, I'd watch it.\n\nAlso enjoy the End while you can. Those nuclear power plants aren't going to be safe for long with no one watching them.",
            "I did an IT internship for a power company, who gave me a tour of a coal powerplant. They had 8+ people working 24x7 just in the control room for the plant. Another 2-6 people working 24x7 deal with buying and selling of extra power from neighbor companies / states . Then I don't even know how many people it takes to move the coal, maintain the plant, and keep things safe. In 50+ years when the grid is more automated and (hopefully) moved mostly to solar/wind - I would guess it's possible the grid stays up awhile.",
            "As for electricity and water? you could theoretically keep them going on a small scale if you knew what you were doing. \n\nYou wouldn't be able to break into a power plant as those things take an entire crew of people to keep running and it'd simple be impossible for a single person to keep up with the work load. But, you could have solar pannels, small wind turbines, a small hydro generater or a combination of these and generate enough power for your self.\n\nSimilarly for water, if you know how to get it from an aquifer or a river, you could keep that going.\n\nAs for internet and cell phone infrastructure? Those are as good as gone, much of the content rests on access restricted servers, they will only last as long as those computers do, once they get shut off or destroried, I doubt there'd be much of a way for you and you alone to save them.",
            "Only advice I could give I'm not seeing is as some mentioned the internet will eventually shut down, but not right away. You can download and print the entirety of wikipedia. That way you have a massive amount of info you can go to if you need it.",
            "You could live near a stream and use Youtube and Wikipedia to create your own small hydroelectric power plant from the running water.\n\nKeeping the internet running would be impossible as the distributed nature of it means that as other people lose power, the servers will go offline. Download what you can and enjoy everything for as long as possible.\n\nSame with mobile phone networks. Ham radio will be your best bet as there will be other survivors throughout the world looking for you as well.",
            "Your best bet would be to learn how to generate some type of electricity via wind or water. Gas would last you a long time but it would go bad eventually. I'm not sure if there is something out there more potent than Stabil but it extends your gas for about a year. \n\nInternet would go away fast. Not only would you need to generate servers by your internet provider but the servers to the websites as well. \n\nWell water would be easy and even filter systems last decades. Your best bet though would to be to boil because if you get a nasty virus you won't have medical support. You would have access to supplies but you don't want to roll the dice on that as you'll be in survival mode.",
            "If you were the last person on earth or one of very few survivors, you find yourself the best location possible: \n\nA) near a heavily wooded area because you\u2019re going to need firewood for the rest of your life\n\nB) with a crystal clear stream or river within walking distance because you\u2019re going to need water\n\nC) your house or cabin should be in a defensible location surrounded by high walls. Without humans around the animals will flourish and you\u2019ll be constantly under attack by say bears, mountain lions, etc. \n\n\nPersonally I\u2019d move to a place with no winters and find a big house in a city with super high walls and huge impenetrable gates and a generator because the electricity will run out and I\u2019d want to use a fridge and have a few lights on at night. \n\nLiving in the city means you can raid all the stores and malls for miles around and fill up the extra rooms with food, water, medicine, books, DVDs, gasoline etc to stay put for a few years. You can also loot yourself seeds and plant food to grow things like tomatoes and herbs. You can have a bunch of hens and a rooster for eggs and meat. Even a few pigs for pork and a couple of dogs for security. \n\nI\u2019d say life as one of few survivors would be an adventure at first but no man is an island and eventually you\u2019ll go crazy with loneliness or want to meet/find another survivor. Lots of epic adventures until you meet someone or give up. Imagine what would happen if you find and get together say 10-50 or even 100 people.

Until any of these system would trip any automatic safety measure. Resetting them and the whole system would require expertise that you probably wouldn't have. Keep in mind that these systems are intended to have constant demand.\n\nSo if a power plant trips, for any reason. Example for the reason that demand drops and voltages in the grid start to go up. Even if you'd be able to get the plant going, synchronising it with the grid is a speciality which is done in tandem with other plants and the grid operator. If you do this incorrectly, then the grid could trip it's own safety features, and resetting these requires speciality skills and operations conducted in many places at once.\n\nThe water infrastructure would probably be relatively fine, it is much simpler than the electrical grid, and overflow system will keep the system going. But with decreased demand the grid, which is once again design to have constant flow in it. Would start to run in to issues where particulates in the pipes would start to settle, microbes start to grow in the still water. So after a while the water would become fairly nasty. The pipes would start to glock up and break.\n\nInternet would probably stay up for a long while. At least until no system flips a bit and crashes. Getting them back online in a speciality task, and far beyond \"Have you tried turning it off and on again\". As long as the clock systems stay functional, it should too. Once that happens, it grinds to a halt.\n\nBut lets say you'd live in a small farm or a cottage, with own water supply. With some elbow grease and DIY spirit, just from basic literature, you could get a self sufficient system going. Renewables, generators, what have you. Since there ain't no neighbours to worry about, in a positive or negative way, you could build even extremely inefficient system from basic hardware store buildings blocks to meet your needs.\n\nIn short.

That takes many skilled people to know how to treat water, or operate power plants. You also have to look at digging/moving coal to burn for electricity. And the distance you'd need to travel between each power plant/water treatment centre/etc would be crazy. In an ideal world where you're the last person, all those places would be close together. But in the real world, it's very unlikely.\n\nThe internet and all electrical things would cut out within days, or a few weeks at most. Fossil fuels are constantly fed into factories.

High amps require thick copper wire, and the inverters are much larger, which also waste watts as waste-heat.\n\nThe best batteries are the 2-cell modules from a Nissan Leaf.

It's even better if you find one with a scoop on the front of the tractor.\n\nThe actual brand doesn't matter (case, Massey-Ferguson, Etc), but once you find one that works well for village-size farming, go out and get several more identical ones for parts. \n\nYou want to set up a farm where it is already flat, less than a mile from a large river (so you can dig an irrigation well that's refreshed from the river), and someplace just half a days drive from the ocean (or less). The ocean can provide lots of fish once you dock a fishing boat as close as possible to your farm.\n\nWhen you can no longer find useable diesel fuel, you can grow soybeans and use the vegetable oil as fuel...",
            "I\u2019ve worked in electrical generation for quite some time, chances are that you wouldn\u2019t be able to run a power plant, or maintain the grid to supply the power. Your best bet would be to set up a small solar array with panels you can get a Home Depot.",
            "No.\n\nIf you lived on maybe a small farm with a windmill or hydroelectric system you could probably keep that house going with water pressure and electricity.  \n\nIt takes a group of 50 full time or so people working 24/7 to operate the very small power plant associated with my work.

            "By salvaging just the right equipment, you could probably maintain small-scale electricity generation, enough to run some lightbulbs at night although maybe not enough to cook with.\n\nMaintaining an entire power planet or water distribution system would be a no-go. There's just too much stuff to take care of and too many ways it can break down.\n\nThe Internet and the cell network would stop functioning. If you could generate electricity at a sufficiently reliable voltage you could keep a phone charged, but it wouldn't have anything to connect to. (You could, however, contact other people using traditional radio transmitters.)",

Then you would need to sanitize the water, and mantain the pipes.\n\nSo tldr, no you can't you don't have enough hours in a day",

The book then goes - what happens next?  and it follows that over days, months, years and centuries.  \n\nOne of my favourite factoids was that the water pumps in new york would stop working after a few days and the subways would slowly flood. after a couple of years, the roads above them would crumble and there would be rivers in place of many of the major streets instead.",
            "No. Plain and simple.   \nWhat you would have to do is use alternative systems, like a home with a cistern and filter, septic tank, and solar power or a gas generator. The internet would go down with the electrical grid and so would the cell towers. Two way radio like Ham or CB would still work as long as you had power to run them.",
            "The pacific northwest has a lot of hydro electric dams, big ones, small ones, should keep lights on here for a while without regular maintenance but eventually they will fail. If I still wanted a large power supply and didn't want to rely on solar I could see myself setting up at one of the small ones further north, learn how to maintain it. Would be a pretty heavy job but I think it could be maintained for a lifetime, by one dedicated person. \n\nSewage is another question, but if I'm living at a dam I'm sure I can rig something up, clean water in one side, the rest over the edge.\n\nAs far as internet, well that's going to be an issue. Connections will be lost, servers will go down, I have doubts. If I wanted to set up a system for myself I'm sure a few smaller servers could be moved to the dam and set up, download what I can, otherwise not much to go on, and wouldn't matter eventually, the electronics wouldn't last forever. Better off getting a good collection of dvds or even vhs, I feel those would last longer in good condition.\n\nYou'd still have the food problem but between fishing and a very large garden it could be managed. Canned/boxed food won't last as long as they make you believe in media. Rice and other grains may last for a decade or so, long enough for you to get everything else set up.\n\nThe reason I like the hydro plant idea over setting up solar somewhere else is the massive amount of electricity you can generate there. If you want to have a 24 hour electric fence around the place you can, if you want to build your own radio tower you have the power for that. Charging electric vehicles, welding, etc. You can do it all at the same time with that much power.\n\nIf you don't give a shit about that a regular farm with a well would be easier.",
            "The short answer is 'no,' not if you're talking about maintaining municipal infrastructure. There's way too much to do, way too much that's going to break, and way too much that relies on complex supply chains. But you could set up your own \"off-grid\" utilities.\n\n* Could I keep potable water running through the pipes?\n\nYou couldn't maintain municipal water infrastructure on your own. Even if we ignore all the labor that goes into producing the treated water that runs into the mains, you couldn't even maintain the pipes on your own--and once some of the mains fail, the system will lose pressure over large areas and the water will stop flowing.\n\nIf you happen to live in a city like NYC, however, you'd have access to plenty of stored water initially: roof-mounted water towers in the city contain huge amounts of water, and the pressure in the buildings they feed is maintained by gravity. As long as people didn't have their taps on when the disaster struck you'd be able to harvest water from buildings with towers for a long time after the disaster. Also, the pressure in the mains feeding the towers is from gravity, so they'd keep operating with no electricity for a while.\n\nA harsh winter without heat would cause pipes filled with sitting water to freeze and burst, though, so even with pressure in the mains and reserves in the towers you probably couldn't expect the plumbing in buildings to last very long. You'd find yourself hitting up the rooftop water towers directly, and praying that they hadn't lost all their reserves to leaks in the system.\n\nAlso, with no labor going into fire mitigation, and no fire crews to contain fires when they start, the whole city would burn down sooner or later.\n\nOn the other hand, if you live in an area with an unpolluted aquifer, you could set up a well and pump your own water. You would need electricity for an automatic pump, but you could also set up a hand-crank pump.\n\n* Could I break into a power plant and maintain electricity output?\n\nNo. Power plants are really complex; they employ numerous specialists with skills requiring years of education and training. You're talking about high-energy operations here, too, so screwing up has big consequences. And even if the disaster miraculously spared the entire staff of the power plant, you'd pretty quickly run into supply chain issues. Power plants that burn fossil fuels burn a lot of fuel. Coal plants rely on shipments of coal, and natural gas or oil plants may have pipeline-fed fuel storage facilities, but the pipelines themselves would need to be maintained, and fuel production at the other end would need to be maintained. And there again, a harsh winter would be a problem, because it would freeze and disable equipment on the pipeline.\n\nYou might think you could just burn less fuel by generating only the power that you need, but that's not really an option. The generators at power facilities are massive machines, and just getting them moving requires a lot of energy--and they produce way more energy that you could efficiently use on your own at their minimum output. That doesn't just mean you'd  have a lovely surplus to enjoy: the grid needs to maintain an equilibrium between power production and power consumption. One of the things the staff at the power plant do is constantly monitor that balance, and turn off or on generating units to match demand. If power is overproduced, the grid will be overloaded. Some stuff's gonna explode, you may cause a fire (with no fire department to help), and everything is going to go down. So to keep the grid going for any appreciable duration, you'd need to turn on and monitor all kinds of power-consumers to match the minimum production of the facility.\n\nOn the other hand, you could use portable generators, solar panels, or small-scale wind generators to power a small area. Solar panels and battery banks would likely be the best option that you could easily procure and set up on your own, and would require the least amount of labor to maintain. There would be plenty of fuel to be scavenged initially for a gas-consuming portable generator, but fires would become a big problem without firefighters and all sorts of labor dedicated to reducing fire risk. Most cities would probably burn down completely not very long after the disaster, and even if you're in a more remote area fire could easily end up destroying your favored reserves. That said, engines can be made to run on wood gas, so there would be renewable fuel options.\n\n* Could I keep the Internet running? Would certain sites become inaccessible?\n\nNo, and internet service would go down pretty quickly, but there would be some stuff you should absolutely do while it's still up.\n\nInformation you get on the internet is physically stored on servers in other locations, and when those servers lose power they'd become inaccessible. Most of what you do on the internet also relies on a specific network of servers and exchanges that route traffic between all the other networked devices, and as those went down you'd become unable to access other connected devices even if they hadn't lost power. To keep the internet as intact as it is now, in addition to all the work of maintaining the various servers and exchanges, you'd also have to keep the global power grid mostly intact and operating. And you couldn't even keep your local power grid operating on your own, so that's a big nope.\n\nBut as another poster says, you could download a copy of wikipedia for local storage. Also, if you managed to get a few survivors together, you could set up an intranet in your community. That'd let you do basic things like send emails and share files, as well as some recreational things like playing certain games over the network. But, like, most of the stuff the internet is actually good for involves other people, right? So if they're all gone it's all just file storage. You could go and physically grab a whole bunch of servers before they're destroyed by fires or exposure, and you'd have whatever data they happen to contain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* If there was another survivor, could I call them on a cell phone?\n\nNo. Cell phones rely on cell towers and complex lookup systems to route traffic. Even if you could keep a local cell tower running, and even if the other survivor was in the same area, if your local tower couldn't call in to the telephone network to route your call, you couldn't make contact.\n\nRadios would still work fine, though. If you actually set up camp in an FM radio station and managed to keep the power on, you could transmit a signal to a distance of 30-40 miles, but you wouldn't have two-way communication at that range unless the other folks had similarly powerful equipment. With handheld ham radios, you could have two-way communication in a range of 1-3 miles or so."

Technically a penis should be buoyant, but may appear much closer to neutral when their is a mild current.\n\nFat is notably less dense than water (by comparison). Although there is minimal fat in a penis, breasts have varying amounts. All breasts that still contain breast tissue should be buoyant.

It\u2019s kind of like that.\n\nSo for eg, in the sea it\u2019s more buoyant because the salt water is ever so slightly denser than fresh water, so our bodies are lighter by comparison.

In 2014, among children 1-4 years old who died from an unintentional injury, one third died from drowning. Among children ages 1-4, most drownings occur in home swimming pools. Drowning is responsible for more deaths among children ages 1-4 than any other cause except for congenital anomalies (birth defects). Among those 1-14, fatal drowning remains the second leading cause of unintentional injury-related death behind motor vehicle crashes.  \n\n\n**Minorities:** Between 1999-2010, the fatal unintentional drowning rate for African Americans was significantly higher than that of caucasians across all ages. The disparity is widest among children 5-18 years old. The disparity is most pronounced in swimming pools. African American children ages 5-19 drown in swimming pools at rates 5.5 times higher than caucasians of the same age. This disparity is greatest among those 11-12 years old, where African Americans drowning in swimming pools at rates 10 times those of caucasians.  \n\n\n*Sources:*  \n*https://www.cdc.gov/HomeandRecreationalSafety/Water-Safety/waterinjuries-factsheet.html*  \n[*http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs347/en/*](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs347/en/)  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",
            "As someone who\u2019s swam competitively for more than 10 years, there\u2019s really no situation in which I could drown in a pool unless I somehow passed out. On the other hand, working as a lifeguard for three summers, I\u2019ve seen people who absolutely would have drowned if myself, a parent, or another lifeguard didn\u2019t intervene.\n\nEdit: I get that what I\u2019m saying doesn\u2019t answer the question perfectly, but let me phrase it like this: I\u2019ve probably lifeguarded for a couple thousand people, and of those 2-3 would have definitely drowned if they didn\u2019t get help. I\u2019ve swam on average about 5 times a week for 10 years and I\u2019ve never come close to drowning.",
            "As a professional lifeguard trainer this is a confusing statistic set.\n\nOn one hand swimmers are trained, skilled and should know their limits. If that follows suit they are less likely to drown. On the other hand they are more likely to take stupid risks, play games (breath hold games, or chicken for example), and goof around in a manner that people who do not know how to swim do not.\n\nThe statistics of drownings are skewed in general. If you are talking private backyard pools it's generally young children. If we are talking public pools it's injuries if guarded well and dumb issues if not guarded well. If we are looking at open bodies of water, those drownings are often young adults and people who are being more reckless (drinking etc).\n\nI have been a guard or guard trainer for over 15 years. People being stupid near water drives me nuts.",

            "I was a competitive swimmer for 8 years,  pool lifeguard for 9 years and 3 years as a Surf Life saver in Australia.  \n\n\nEven now some 10 years since I swum my last race. In the pool it's like I am flying, I have complete control and barring unconsciousness drowning in a pool just wouldnt happen.  \n\n\nHowever the Ocean is a different story. The beach I volunteered at is called Woolamai. An Australian Surf beach in Victoria. It's an extremely dangerous beach. Being a swimmer and plenty of experience I knew my way around surf.  \n\n\nI've had 2 near drowning experiences. Both caused by overconfidence, however I saved myself with experience.  \n\n\n1st was when I was 18 years old (28 now). Still extremely fit and had 2 years as a surf life saver. It was autumn and my surf buddies and I decided to go for a body board at Woolamai (not always the best conditions for surfing this was one of those times). We did what we always do, you the rip tide to get behind the break to ride waves in and repeat.   \n\n\nA storm hit and the conditions changed. We realized we needed to get to shore. Easiest way was to ride a wave in on our boards. I was the last to catch one. However the waves I had to work with were not catch-able. All white wash and churning water. It was so large and powerful it snapped my body board, ripped my fins off and tumbled me underwater until I was out of air. I was in big trouble.  \n\n\nWaves come in sets which meant was I was tossed around like a rag doll by each of the coming waves. Rather than fight the waves or swim towards shore I made sure I stayed out of the rip and used the small breaks between waves to calm my breathing and I dove to the bottom of the water and drug my hands into the sand. Eventually the natural tide of waves pushed me towards the shore.  \n\n\nI reached the sand. Coughed up some water. and while we all talked about how lucky we were the waves washed my broken board and my lost flippers onto the beach. Had I panicked. It's likely I would have drowned.  \n\n\nThe 2nd time was maybe a couple years ago. Since I wrote an essay for the last story I'll keep this one short. Myself and friends were at a surf beach. Unfit and overconfident swam out into the surf as I always did. I got tired after catching a few waves and decided to go to the beach. Unfortunately I stupidly got caught in a rip like a novice. I didnt panic but I was in surf too strong for my fitness level.  \n\n\nOptions were to swim out of the RIP or let it take me out to beyond the break and swim back in. I chose to battle the rip and swim into the shore bound waves. I was successful however I was so out of breath that I couldnt stay under water long enough to duck dive under the waves or ride them in. I took on alot of water. Luckily just like the last time I let the shore bound waves carry me to the sand. However when I got to the sand my arms and legs were jelly and gut was in knots and I honestly was scared for my life because I knew that due to my own overconfidence I put myself in situation I wasnt ready for.  \n\n\nTHE TLDR;  \n\n\nSwimmers are far less likely to drown yes. However real, experienced swimmers are no match for mother nature. You have to respect the ocean otherwise it will take you.  \n\n\nSide note: My opinion is that high level swimming should be mandatory education until you leave highschool.  \n\n\n&#x200B;",
            "Well the question needs some definitions - so how about the following:\n\n1. Swimmer - any one who can swim four laps of a pool without stopping (100 yards)\n2. Good Swimmer - swim four laps of a pool under 1:30\n3. Competitive swimmer - under 1 minute\n4. Waterman/Waterwoman - under 1 minute plus strong surfing/ocean knowledge\n\nHere is an approximate breakout of rescues by Swimmer type and ocean water condition:\n\n1. calm water - rarely have any rescues, we can have thousands of people to cover between lifeguard towers and may not even get a rescue that day. If a rescue occurs it will be a non-swimmer or tired young child. Average Rescue count per lifeguard < 1\n2. Small wave day ( < 3 foot wave face) - rescues will occur, particularly at beaches with large crowds of people, hot day. Rescues will be mostly non-swimmers and children in rip current areas.  Average Rescue count per lifeguard < 5\n3. Medium wave day ( 3 to 5 foot wave faces). A lot of rescues occur in this size range as the currents are deceptively strong and your average \"swimmer\" or \"good swimmer\" with out ocean knowledge can be caught in a rip current and tire out and need help. Competitive pool swimmers will still be strong enough to overcome the currents to get back to the beach.  Depending on the particular beach and crowd size, we can have up to 20 rescues per lifeguard on a day like this. The type of rescue has now shifted from non-swimmers who generally stay out of the water when there are larger waves to poor swimmers to even good swimmers unfamiliar with ocean currents\n4. Large wave day (5 to 10 foot waves).    People who consider themselves good or even competitive pool swimmers will now make up to half of the rescues as they overestimate their abilities in the ocean environment. The currents are now strong enough that even competitive pool swimmers can't just overcome the currents by swimming capability. The other half will be weaker swimmers who are thinking they are safe just going into their waist and then get knocked over and swept out. Hot weekend days like this on a tourist beach such as Santa Monica can mean 40 plus rescues per lifeguard with at least half of them people who consider themselves \"good\" swimmers and in a pool setting probably are. \n\nIn summary, to answer the question. Swimmers are more likely to drown if their background is pool swimming and we now define \"water\" as being in dangerous ocean conditions else anyone who is \"good\" or better is very very unlikely to drown in calm water.  \n\nSource: 30 years of ocean lifeguarding in Southern California with over 1,000 rescues.\n\n&#x200B;",

            "Most of the answers here are anecdotal. The way I read your question is does a frequent swimmer have, over their lifetime, a higher chance of drowning than someone who maybe knows how to swim but doesn't do it frequently?

An open water competitive swimmer will have a much higher probably of drowning than someone who doesn't know how to swim but never attempts to swim.",

I came up and quickly jumped out and sat there panicking for no reason. Woke up 2 days later in the hospital. I had seizure that day, and they said if I would have been in the water I would have died by drowning. I had never had one before that day, but have had more since then. I don't swim anymore.

            "I have a feeling this varies based on the what type of professional swimmers. Olympic swimmers that train in pools are probably very unlikely to drown - they are used to pools and rarely swim alone. But professional triathloners who tend to train and race in open water put themselves at much greater risk - boats, strong currents, storms, etc.",
            "I know this is old but I want to echo some of the points here as I was a competition swimmer in pool and open water for 15 years. \n\nThe only sub population of swimmers (professional or other high level such as college or club teams) that are more likely to drown in normal circumstances would be open water swimmers for immense undertakings such as the English channel swim. This is mainly due to circumstances that are beyond control such as currents or water temperatures. While not statistically significant, common sense regarding the dangers would lead you to this assumption.\n\nIt is not unheard of for a seasoned athlete to suffer a medical emergency in open water. Fran Crippen comes to mind as he was a very prominent swimmer in both the pool and open water scenes. Although I do not know the actual cause of death, it was reported to have been partly due to conditions of the water being too warm causing a few other reported medical issues with fellow swimmers. \n\nAnecdotally, I myself had to retire from swimming entirely after both rotator cuffs failed in competition in an open water scenario. I was lucky that my issue happened within plain sight of other competitors and the lifeguards and that I had training as an open water rescuer myself.\n\n In swimming, like in other sports, competitors push themselves past pain and injury and it can lead down a bad path. In my case, I had injuries for a few years off and on and wasn't able to slow myself down in trainings. No life is worth a competition and that's something I really try and make sure is clear when I talk with young athletes.\n\nI'd also echo the free diving comments as I have some experience here as well. Freediving can be incredibly dangerous.",

For the latter cases, I always wear a life jacket the entire time I'm there. I run the *probably* low risk of drowning if I wade, so I don't do that very often.\n\n\nI suspect most people who drown are poor swimmers who have some reason to be near water.

            "Not sure about statistics but I do have experience to share. I was both a competitive swimmer and a commercial fisherman and while being a good swimmer can help your survivability in the water, it is by no means a guarantee. First, cold water locks up your muscles and can make swimming even relatively short distances daunting in open water (yes, this can be overcome to a degree with specialized training but it is a niche skill). Second,  if you end up in the water with clothes on, they hamper the ability to use most strokes by a very significant degree. I have practiced this as part of coast guard survival training and it is much much harder than you would imagine. I've also fallen overboard in a real life scenario and although I was able to tread water, I certainly would have drown if not for the swift intervention of the rest of the crew. ",

We were taught this. The top post in this thread is the perfect example \"there\u2019s really no situation in which I could drown in a pool unless I somehow passed out.\". A lot of people feel that way and even apply it to open water, hence so many people not wearing life jackets.\n\nHypothermia, currents (a weak current can kill.....a strong one can destroy you), falling/going in at wrong times/places, diving accidents, injuries, environmental accidents, cramps, medical situations, trying to help someone in distress (a 5 year old panicking for his life could drown you), SCUBA incidents, misjudging distance, swimming in the wrong direction, weather that turns bad, drinking and drugs is a big one.....the list goes on an on.\n\nGranted only a few of these apply to a high level swimmer in a pool there's at least a few that would apply. People found dead after drinking in pools are usually experienced swimmers.",
            "For swimmers, drowning is likely due to overconfidence and placing ourselves in more dangerous situations. We might swim out farther, try to dive deeper, etc.\n\nHowever, I feel statistically, it is going to be people who don't know how to swim are still more likely to drown. Which makes sense because for those who don't know how to swim, or don't know how to swim well, most situations in the water would be considered dangerous situations.",

Combined with a little bit of common drug boosting one's confidence, ie alcohol, it boosts the mortality risk in waters. \n\nMy grandmother was a competitive swimmer, and she had so many stories about swimming and diving champions dying at a sea or in rivers. A lot of them involved alcohol, bravado and betting. ",
            "A lot of drownings happen when people don't plan to be in the water in the first place. Hopping aboard a ship..... Don't plan to swim...... Get knocked in- trouble ensues. Drownings do sometimes happen to people who do know who to swim well. It's usually because they did not plan or never expected to end up in water.",
            "As a person who grew up on the beach, few people died generally. Those that did were almost always either tourists from somewhere that didn't have a beach or young children (unfortunately). I'd imagine that those who swim regularly would not only have better prowess as you put it but also a better understanding of being in the water. This should make them \"drown resistant\". \n\nIn the case of the beach, when you sit and watch the waves on the rocks for a lot of hours over a period of time, you quickly understand that you could die there from one freak wave even if all appears calm. You see easily that one wave sweeps you into the water, the next and you'll be ktfo, but under water. Swimming in safe beaches (as in not places where the waves smash rocks all day) you learn quickly that waves really don't need to be huge to push you around like a rag doll and that you can pretty much get pushed or pulled in any direction. \n\nYou become a stronger swimmer, but you also get a way better \"nope radar\" telling you when and where it's safe to swim, and when to stay out of the water. Essentially, the small number of people that died were all inexperienced, commonly gone swimming in a storm or huge swell, or isolated and swept off rocks by a wave bigger than average. \n\nThe locals simply knew that you don't mess with it. You don't go fishing or whatever on rocks near waves in isolated places. You don't go alone and unaided/unobserved into huge waves. Surfers all went out in groups and looked out for each other, or otherwise near help. It was never joked about, it was serious shit, you stopped people if you heard they wanted to do dumb shit, or had been drinking (even as a fairly irresponsible teenager). No local person ever died, so I say more experience = less drowning ",
            "every few years i hear of teenagers drowning in the lakes in my area. mostly because they are drunk or dove into some underwater object. there have been some health related ones too. and i remember a child drowning at summer camp last year"

Why the fuck weren't you paying attention?! Fucking moron!\"fashion that we all go through from time to time. \n\nAnd sadly, unless you helped them find their way, you'll come back later to see them belly up legs crossed. Somewhere out there in the world, Dan and Steve are wondering where their boy is cuz he's never late to go to the hive and throw back some nectar. And poor Irma is crying all of her eyes out because she thought Kevin was a such a nice guy, a little odd, but cute in a different way, and he'd never stand someone up like this. \n\nSo next time you see someone banging their head against a window, help a little dude out. Irma really doesn't want to keep banging Brad. She needs a little buzzy dude that wants to settle down.",

            "your house is warm and the lights are on. bugs are attracted to warmth and light. once they\u2019re inside, it\u2019s warm and light *everywhere*. they\u2019re not looking for the cold, dark gaps so they can get back out.",
            "They follow a smell to a small gap (that's how they find the gap) then they come inside through the gap but there is nothing that leads them out. That's how fruit flies trap work for example.",
            "My guess would be they are coming in a search of food or a place to nest\n\n outside is alot brighter so the windows have a reflection and my guess is that helps them to navigate trough the cracks and they don't have that \"help\" to get out",
            "Sometimes its because they go through the larval stage somewhere in your house (like in the drywall) and then crawl out to fly around in your house",

            "Flying bug has 1% chance to enter/leave house. 10 000 bugs are outside, 100 get inside, 1 of them gets outside, you're left with 99 bugs.",
            "Density equilibrium",
            "Some bugs are chemotactic. This means that their movement is influenced by chemicals in the air (or water, sharks do it). Imagine a bug is sensitive to CO2 (which we breathe out) they move around randomly until the run into signs of those chemicals then they become more precise in their turning as they move along the path from least amount of the chemical to higher concentrations of it, which would, in general, be some emitter of that chemical. \n\nSeveral people in a room will noticeably raise the co2 concentration in a normal-sized room because it builds up in the confined space and this can draw them in through small spaces where it leaves the room. Getting out is much more difficult because they are still influenced by the concentration gradient and they don't have the ability to reverse this taxis to get out. (No houses existed throughout most of their evolution, random movement would normally allow them to move on) \n\nYou can trap fruit flies by putting a banana in a plastic water bottle with a funnel at the top of the opening leading in. They fly in to lay their eggs and can't find their way out except based on pure randomness. Moths are phototactic, which is why the fly around your bulbs at night even on to death. The largest light in the night sky for most of their evolution was the moon. Trapped by human innovation.",
            "I thought it was temperature sensitivity that helps them find the inside. Along with pressure differentials. Going reverse has less for them tosense. Kinda like how which side of the fan you spit into has alternate effects. Conjecture on my part.",
            "imagine seeing a tiny bit of light in the darkness, now imagine trying to find a tiny bit of darkness in a fully illuminated room.  \n\nThey follow sensory inputs that stand out\n\nAlso helps to imagine that they function like little robots with basic programming rather than logical thinking",

If you kill the bug, we know you're unsafe.\n\nSince you're asking this question, you're obviously not one of the good ones, Spider666er.",
            "I think it's because of air flow. Cold air is being sucked out of your house at that tiny crack, and when a bug flies by they maybe can feel the change? And the same air flow just isn't on the inside, making it harder for them to find again.\nI'll sit outside on my porch with the sliding door ajar so I can feel the coolness from inside. And I can be as dumb as a bug sometimes, so that makes sense to me",
            "I like Jim Gaffigans bit about this when he's complaining about camping. \"If the outdoors is so great why are all the bugs trying to get into my house\"",
            "One explanation for some insects is that they're nearly blind in houses because their eyes cant see at such a low light spectrum. That's why they fly so calm and collected outdoors, but extremely uncontrolled inside houses, and also why they fly towards windows.",
            "So bugs are not particularly complex... they can complete complex actions because the relatively simple set of moves they have can add up to complexity but not necessarily.\n\n\nThese actions are evolved to solve random spaces that nature provides but very quickly break down in the face of manicured spaces... like our homes.\n\nSo a wasp smells decaying meat! Yum yum! So it heads towards the smell and is stymied by the roof... until it finds the wall and goes up the wall to the top and finds a gap, thus gaining entry into your attic. From there it follows the food smell to a light fixture and finds a gap thus gaining entry into your kitchen.\n\n\nThus far it has used moves detect food, follow smell, go up, find gap. \n\nSo once we are done with the chicken skin you dropped on the ground yesterday it is time to exit the kitchen. The whole area is on a scale that is too large for the wasp to understand so it might as well be not useful to figure anything out... When was the last time you used the relative position of yourself and the sun to figure something out? You can do it but it isn't easy and you are WAY more sophisticated than the wasp.\n\nIt wants to find its nest, it wants to head in the direction it came from, but it is inside. It can see the other side of the glass because it has a move follow the sun, but that move doesn't work with glass ... it just follows the sun. \n\nSo it eventually bangs its head against glass for a few days uselessly using moves that don't work indoors.",
            "Well they're probably being drawn in by their senses, perhaps by warm air or the smell of food that are leaking out of the cracks and crevices, and essentially leading the bug directly inside.",
            "A lot of flies and bugs navigate by airstreams and wind. You usually have no wind in your house so it can't navigate out, especially next to the window panes of an open window. Take a fan and blow it towards the open portion of the window and the bug will always find its way out",

            "I live in Ontario, so this answer might differ for some, but I always thought it had to do with attractive smells, light, moisture, heat, O2/ CO2 levels. I know that flies and wasps are attracted to food (like when you\u2019re cooking) and can sense that through cracks or vents and that\u2019s a reason they can end up there. Some bugs are attracted to light, so they\u2019ll find the path of least resistance to the strongest light source. And like others are saying, it is pure chance.",
            "My guess: If they move fairly randomly, some will find their way in/out. There are many more outside than inside, so you'll have more randomly finding their way in than out.",
            "i always thought it would be by smell. they smell something attractive coming from the gap, which is the only spot smell can escape, but once they want to leave, they can't find the gap again as there's no smell trail to outside",
            "I think that most times they get in the house purely by accident.",
            "Because they're that dumb coming inside too. The insect actually making it through your window was maybe a 1/1000 chance.\n\nThey're not good learners, therefore that poor insect has pretty much the same chance of getting out. Hence they look stupid, because they are.",
            "There are literally thousands of them right outside that could get lucky and get in. \nThere\u2019s only that one bumping around inside. He\u2019d have to be really lucky to pull it off twice.",
            "First, bugs are dumb. They probably didn't intend to get in or out, they just flew in search of food and got stuck\n\nNow, why would the get stuck? Imagine all the bugs in your area guess a random code every second. There are lots of bugs, and lots of seconds, so eventualy some would \"get the code right\" and get into your house. They roam around for a bit and then try to get out with the same chance. Not there are maybe 5 bugs, and you're annoyed so seconds seem to take longer, so it would take way longer for them to get out",
            "I'm in no way a specialist but it may be to also do with light? I spent two and a half years as a beekeepers assistant. When we were doing honey extraction the shed would fill up with bees which would crawl through the tiny air vents placed along the shed. When the shed got too full we would turn off all the lights and open a door. The bees would all start flowing out towards the light. \n\nSince seeing this first hand I do this with most things that come in at night. Bees, wasps, especially birds. I just turn off all my lights inside and they find their way out the door or window. \n\nPerhaps they can't go back the same way because they are more attracted to the light outside the window. Perhaps your house is darker than outside. Does this happen more during the day or night?",
            "I\u2019m a former exterminator. Bugs and rodents can actually sense the heat coming from your house through the smallest of cracks/holes and slip in that way a lot of the time. The change in temperature coming through a crack is like a lighthouse on the open ocean, if you will.",

            "I'm assuming here, but from a probability standpoint, think of the sheer amount of bugs outside. It's likely some of them will get through a gap even if it's impossibly small. Getting out is a bit different. It's far less likely that those same few bugs who got in will get back out. \n\nBugs are essentially stupid organic robots that react to a stimulus in the environment. If something smells good, for example, they go towards it. They aren't logical and don't understand the difference between inside and outside. They'll fly around more or less randomly unless they have a good reason to go somewhere.",

There is bait inside so with the wide opening it's easy for the minnows to swim in. But with such a narrow exit, they can't figure out how to get out.
