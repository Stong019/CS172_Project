That's the kind of character he plays, and that's the kind of roles he chooses.\n\nThe article (I can't find it) postulated that that is what Nic Cage does.  He picks roles that let him be awkward and unpolished, and he portrays characters in that style on purpose, because THAT is what we all expect when we see that he's in a film.\n\nHope that makes sense.\n\nEdit:  I should say that all of this above is \"some of the time\".

            "A good portion of people seem to get stuck in a \"black and white\" good-guy-bad-guy kind of thing when it comes to this sort of stuff. Since Heard has been decided by them to be the bad guy, then by extension Depp is the good guy. But in reality yes, they were both shitty to each other and a lot of people honestly are shitty in some way to some varying extent. There is no black and white most times, just shades of gray.",
            "I think its important to look at the counts the jury ruled on and the message they were sending in doing so. They ruled in Depp's favor on ALL of 3 counts of defamation and wanted to add another 5 million dollars of punitive damage against Amber Heard. They ruled in Amber's favor on 1 count, specifically that Depp's ex-attorney Waldman defamed Amber Heard by saying that they staged a crime scene. So if we trust the juries judgement, they are saying that she defamed Johnny Depp with accusations of physical and sexual abuse for her own benefit, while on the other side, someone who may be seen as an agent of Depp, defamed Heard by accusing her of staging a crime scene. I think to the public he's seen as being vindicated because no one cares if his ex attorney wrote something that is technically impossible to know but seemed to be correct about overall. Whereas this verdict is devastating to Amber Heard, both financially and to her reputation. Edit: thank you everyone for the kind awards!",
            "It was a defamation trial, not an abuse trial. He is paying because he slandered her, she is paying more because she was more slanderous.\n\nNo one was on trial for abuse, that is a criminal matter, not a civil one.",
            "Because life isn't black and white. An abusive partner can push you to become an uglier version of yourself. If you had an abusive partner i wouldn't be amazed we'd be able to find 3-4 occasions where you react in a toxic way too.\n\nThat said. I think its dumb for people to takes sides like this in a situation we ultimately know nothing of.",
            "The reason the jury ruled in favor of one of Heard\u2019s counterclaims was not related to abuse. It was about his lawyer\u2019s claims that she \u201corchestrated a hoax.\u201d  Your assessment that it was related to his toxic behavior is incorrect.",
            "It's not enough for people to recognize who was wronged, every wronged person has to be a saint (which is the same treatment people get at their funerals). Then it becomes a competition of who worships them more. I laughed at all the memes about how \"Johnny was there for us growing up, let's be there for him.\" He wasn't \"there for you.\" He was making millions in Hollywood and you happened to like some of his movies. Nothing wrong with that, just don't get confused.\n\nDepp getting some justice for what Heard put him through is cathartic and has done some good for drawing attention to male victims of domestic abuse, but let's not pretend he's completely innocent. He was a drug-addicted alcoholic who fell for a pretty, young psychopath. It's over now. Let's all move on.",
            "There's still a bit of a stigma for men to air complaints about being abused by a woman, so Depp got bravery points.\n\nHowever, I kind of think neither one of them are going to be partner of the year.",
            "People forget that abuse victims aren\u2019t uwu innocent babies. Abuse victims can be bad people, and can be abusers too in other relationships. My abuser was an abuse victim. Doesn\u2019t negate their trauma with abuse but that doesn\u2019t make them a good person, they\u2019re still an abuser. \n\nAlso, it\u2019s easier to hate someone you don\u2019t know (Amber Heard) than someone you do (Johnny Depp). Everyone knows Depp so it\u2019s hard to accept he\u2019s a bad person, but Heard isn\u2019t as widely know outside of the trial, so it\u2019s easier to automatically hate her.",
            "Probably because he came across as the one being bullied who fought back and got blamed too.",
            "He had to pay because his lawyer talked shit, not because he was abusive. \n\nThat said, I've been in a relationship like this and I wasnt innocent in it. She was the instigator, the aggressor, and the abuser - but I let her drive me insane and I let it affect my behavior and I definitely pushed when I was kicked. I definitely screamed and lost my mind and said awful things. \n\nIt takes a lot to keep your cool while being be kicked and punched and screamed at, and slapped, and having someone ruin every little thing they can because they're mentally unwell and completely unwilling to do anything about it. \n\nEspecially when you care about them. \n\nSo yeah, he definitely did some of the shit she said he did. But losing your sanity here and there is not to be compared to what she did.",
            "I was in a similar relationship to what they had. I like to think I\u2019m a genuine person and nicer than most my peers. My ex brought me to the brink of wanting to become homicidal, it\u2019s easy to be a good man in good times. The gaslighting, the manipulating, the cheating. It\u2019s called \u201ccrazy making\u201d.",
            "The reason he had to pay was not because he \"was abusive\" (whether he was or not), it is because one of the statements his lawyer made was deemed to be defamatory towards Heard, it has nothing to do with whether or not Johnny Depp was abusive",
            "> I'm glad that everyone is starting to see that men can be DV victims too \n\nIt's basically this. \n\nIt's an important issue for many people that has yet to truly be normalized in modern society, making it a potentially huge watershed moment in the normalization of empathy for abused men and a cultural shift that's been long to come around.",
            "Probably because they were both shitty and toxic in their relationship, but after the split he kept his mouth shut and didn't try to leverage his shitty relationship into a paycheck.\n\nI doubt either one of them were great to each other in their relationship. The trial made all of that pretty clear. But Amber tried to take advantage of the climate during the time to win some public opinion and get paid. That's not how the system should work. They both should have split and shut the fuck up and went their separate ways because they were both shitty. \n\nBut Amber decided to tip the scales and caused serious financial damage to Johnny Depp and his career, which she now has to pay back to some degree. This might be unpopular but I do think this sets a powerful precedent. Amber doesn't seem like a victim that deserves money for suffering years of abuse as an innocent victim. She seems like someone who recognized an opportunity to manipulate public opinion of Johnny for money and took it. It just didn't work out in the end.\n\nEdit: \n\nAlso wanted to quickly add that Johnny paid a reported 6-7 million to Amber since their divorce. The court ultimately ordered her to pay around 8 million net back to him for damages so that seems reasonably fair to me. Neither one of them should have financially benefited from their divorce imo.",
            "Based on everything publicized so far, it\u2019s fairly clear Depp is a man with problems ie drugs, drink, codependencies, etc \n\nThe reason why he\u2019s getting so much praise isn\u2019t so much on a perceived status of sainthood but for two things:\n\n1.  Heard committed a malicious act, lied often, and lied wildly.  The issue is she wasn\u2019t just being fucked up alongside him in a relationship where it was just the 2 of them and who cares, it\u2019s that she brought this lie to the world stage and attempted to lie to everyone else in a manner calculated to benefit her financially and professionally.\n\nThere were huge overtones of her actions basically being that if she couldn\u2019t be with him where she could dominate him, she was going to do what she could to milk the situation for what it\u2019s worth.  \n\nTherefore, for the wider deception, she\u2019s a perpetrator not just to him, but to a public who can relate to being victims of a gaslighting bully. \n\nThe other part of this is that she\u2019s clearly mentally ill, but people can\u2019t relate to it because she\u2019s not at the point of self awareness where she can stop gaslighting and frankly, a LOT of abuse victims have a negative visceral reaction to her.  Even if she keeps saying she\u2019s the victim, her stance, her body language, the things she does - FEEL the way an abuser\u2019s does.  If you listen to her answers, she\u2019s explicit on subjects that matter to her, but not on matters that are logical or reasonable - and this unfortunately, is a bit of a psychopathic tell.  They live by manipulation as they\u2019re missing a core self that could actually empathize and show true emotion.  \n\n2.  Depp\u2019s suffering is relatable.  He\u2019s clearly not got his shit together, but for the most part - aside from him finally biting back with the UK case and this, he seemed perfectly happy to keep his crap with Amber a personal matter and his reactions to her in recordings etc betray a man who\u2019s conflicted as being very beholden to a person he knows isn\u2019t good for him. \n\nIf we go to pre-Heard times, there wasn\u2019t this kind of negativity with Depp\u2019s break ups.  And for the most part he seemed married happily for a very long while.  \n\nHeard on the other hand, has a trail of former friends behind her.  She provides a very deep contrast to Depp that makes him look much better than if say, we just considered him on his own.",
            "Because he didn't write an op Ed about it.",
            "it's important to keep in mind that abuse is mind warping. if someone subjects you to constant torment and makes your life a living hell that is not good for your mind and can drive you to say and do things that are toxic and out of character for you. as someone who has been in an (emotionally) abusive situation i can't tell you how much i wish i could have changed some of the things i did because i wasn't thinking straight\n\nyou're right that they were both bad to each other, that's hardly an excuse, and treating him like a martyr or saint is not right. but i hope looking at it this way sheds some light on the situation",
            "The money has nothing to do with the abuse itself on either side. This is a defamation suit about statements made to the public. I\u2019m pretty sure the money he owed wasn\u2019t even from a statement he made, but rather one his lawyer made (I may be mistaken on that part, though).",
            "Mostly because the case was about defamation and not abuse. Also a lot of times when people are abused for so long they snap and appear toxic/hysterical, so I'm assuming this is what happened to Johnny (See: Gabby Petito getting almost arrested for acting \"crazy\" and violent to Brian Laundrie and then he was the one who murders her a few days later because she was likely at her breaking point and that's why she was being violent back at him). \n\nThis is how abusers get away with their abuse for so long. They beat their partner down for so long that eventually they just snap. Granted, we don't know if this is what happened but it's clear he was far less abusive than she was AND we have a recording of him threatening to press charges for her abuse and of Amber telling him to try it and see if anyone believes him. So I'm guessing he was definitely not nearly as violent as her nor abusive and toxic.",
            "I think it's an intersection of a lot of things. \n\nFirst, you're right in that there's generally not much acknowledgement given to men as DV victims - in a lot of cases in a DV call, the police will just arrest the man and ask questions later, even if he was the victim. If you're a man who's been abused, as far as society is concerned, you're either a \"sissy\" or it doesn't matter because men are usually the abuser in a domestic situation.\n\nSecond, when the allegations against Depp first came out, the media reaction was immediate and overwhelmingly in Heard's favor, with a few exceptions like Keith Ferguson. It was a juicy topic, and his career took a hit.\n\nThird, there's the black-and-white morality of the internet. There are a lot of people unconditionally supporting Depp, and a lot of people who were convinced he was an abuser from the start who still unconditionally support Heard. It was a sensationalized trial, and if you look at basically any sensationalized trial throughout recent history, people pick one side to support, and no gray area is permitted.\n\nFourth, there are a lot of MRAs and red-pilled GamerGate types who are being loud about this, because as with any case where a woman is involved, that woman represents *all* women, so if *she* lied, that means all women are liars and the #MeToo movement is invalid.\n\nAll I can be sure of is that they both had issues that were exacerbated by a toxic relationship and if they found a genie in a bottle, their first wish would be never to have met the other. It never fails to disappoint me when people treat trials like this as public entertainment.",
            "Idk what the media coverage was like anywhere else but in England, I was a teenager at the time of the Op-ed and Sun newspaper incidents and I remember a lot of people boycotting him and his movies, hating him, he was one of the first instances of \"cancelling\" that I remember. It thoroughly ruined his reputation and propelled her career.\n\nNow years later I think people don't feel remorse for turning the tables since it's now just evening out all the shit Johnny Depp faced.\n\nI personally don't think most people learnt their lesson of don't jump to conclusions which is what landed Depp in this mess in the first place.",
            "So I'm going to use my situation as an example. My ex-husband was abusive. And I had a hard time speaking up about it because I began being toxic myself, which i feel guilty about. My therapist explained that it's a defense mechanism. When someone's pushing you, you try to protect yourself by pushing back.\n\nThis article describes it as reactionary abuse:\n\nhttps://www.domesticshelters.org/articles/identifying-abuse/is-mutual-abuse-real\n\nEdit: I am not saying if Johnny's Depp's behavior was right or wrong. I actually didn't follow the court case too closely. I'm just saying some of his behavior may stem from this.",
            "My guess is that it's because she wrote an article that made her come off as this amazing woman who got abused by the big bad man. And people believed her with that envisioned in their head. I'm sure him losing the UK trial for defamation didn't help things either.\n\nThat's why when this trial exposed her as somebody who wasn't this abused perfect woman and was in fact pretty nasty and equally as abusive, people started sympathizing with Depp.",
            "Probably because Depp never publicly lied about her abusing him in an attempt to ruin her career. If they want to be mutually toxic, that's one thing. But she went a full 20 steps further than that",
            "[deleted]",
            "I think because a lot of people who have been in abusive relationships can relate to his behaviour. It brings out a side of you that your loved ones would never recognize because it is soo suffocating. It brings out anger, bitterness, depression. You want the person to suffer like they have made you constantly suffer under the guise of \u2018love\u2019. It is exhausting and chips at pieces of you until you do not even recognize your who you are anymore. Is it ok? Absolutely not. But I understand and that is why I personally support JD.",
            "I do want to point out that early on in this trial Reddit clearly was biased towards Depp, in the sense that several users continuously posted pro-Depp video analyses which gained traction. \n\nAlso probably has a lot to do with men's rights people and redpill people due to its intersection with allegations of female on male abuse.",
            "Because Amber Heard obviously lied and provided false evidence. This is obvious to anyone who watched any amount of that trial.",
            "None of the money has anything to do with abuse. It was all about defamation.",
            "He's no saint, but his drug use is excused for the most part as a coping mechanism for his abuse. The difference is, Johnny's mistakes are honest, he owned up and never claimed to have not done drugs. Amber, however, has lied at every turn and has admitted abusing Johnny. People are therefore more sympathetic towards Johnny. It's also far easier to deal in black/white absolutes, most people know he isn't perfect, but it's easier to just praise Johnny and slander Amber.",
            "It's because she lied about being an abuse victim.  It was clearly proven in court that there was absolutely no evidence she was abused.  However, there was a lot of proof that she was the one being abusive in the relationship and starting all the shady shit that made all this come to light.",
            "Because men rarely win these things in court.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBecause Amber was clearly the perpetrator here.  She shit in his bed, cut his finger off with a broken bottle, and beat him multiple times.  She then repeatedly lied and exaggerated everything she spoke about.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDepp would get drunk and hit cupboards , its violent behavior sure, but its not even comparable.",
            "In my personal opinion, I think it boils down to just how maliciously Amber abused her position for personal enrichment that brings out the sympathy for Johnny. While they managed to show, a little bit, that he was maybe manipulative and mentally abusive (disregarding all of the included defense that it was Amber that drive him to his addiction), but that she played it up, lied about it, gossiped and aligned people against him, and dragged his name publicly through the mud for things he didn't do, especially using the \"me too\" movement to garner extra sympathy and maybe even whole roles in movies.\n\nWhat he did to her wasn't great, but it was almost negligable to what she did back, and in the end what was determined was that she effectively intentionally torpedoed his career in an attempt to propel her own, which was what the case was about, not who was more abusive. That was just a side effect.",

            "Almost everyone has vouched for him including his exes. Depp had problems but they were mostly just limited to himself. If a female victim hits her abuser back you wouldn't call them both shitty people you'd say she got forced to retaliate in self defense. There is conclusive proof that Amber has instigated multiple physical confrontations and no proof that Depp ever started any confrontation. There is also alot of proof that Depp was actively trying to avoid confrontation while Amber kept trying to force him into it. Victims are allowed to retaliate in self defense. He started recording every moment they were together, and tried every possible method to avoid confrontation. How much more does a man have to do so people stop treating him as an abuser instead? This is the issue with male abuse victims, they have to be perfect angels for people to believe them. Anything less than that and people immediately start calling both parties guilty or worse blame him entirely.\n\nNow the trial was about defamation not abuse. The judge told him to pay her because of the defamation that happened to Amber because of the trial. Its not a proof that the court believes Depp abused her.",
            "Neither one is a saint, but she lied AND played victim. The defamation she won against him was because of something his former lawyer said about Amber, not something Johnny said. She dragged him through the mud. \n\nTogether they are a toxic storm.",
            "There is a reason that AH is getting a chunk of cash and it's because Depp's lawyer accused them of faking a piece of evidence. It's not like they said he did a little bit of abuse so he has to pay a bit.",
            "For me, many years ago I read up on \u201creactionary abuse\u201d which is basically when someone who is/has been abused starts reacting by lashing out at their abuser in return. The things they say and do can then be seen as abusive in turn and justification for the original abusers actions. \n\nIt\u2019s a very complicated topic and hard to navigate what is truth and what is fiction. But with the tapes of amber instigating and faulting Johnny for \u201crunning away\u201d and very clearly admitting to getting physical with him, I tend to think Amber was the original abuser and Johnny was reacting after taking too much. From the evidence brought forward I was never convinced he ever got physical with her in return either. The words he said, especially when venting to friends were vulgar and out of line. But I lean towards that being how he was coping being pushed to his limits by her. \n\nThat is what I took away from what I\u2019ve seen. I don\u2019t think Johnny is a great person, or even a good one. However, I think Amber is far worse. I think his career being destroyed, being dropped by the same company that instead kept her on in her role with no active criminal litigation against him is/was completely unacceptable, and even more so when evidence of abuse on her part came forward. If producers had collectively decided not to support either of them pending litigation/while all of this was going on I would have understood. To take that firm stance against him, and yet not with her, when no matter if he was or wasn\u2019t, she was clearly (also?) abusive\u2026I can\u2019t agree with it. \n\nIf Hollywood had turned on Amber like they did Johnny, if Amber hadn\u2019t used the me too movement meant to give legitimate victims a place to speak out as a PR move and to defame Johnny when she was clearly not the saint/victim she claimed to be, I don\u2019t think people would have rallied behind Johnny like they did. \n\nAlso I don\u2019t think it helped that she brought everything up right when people were getting FED UP with cancel culture and the attitude of guilty until proven innocent in the media today.",
            "Ok but the 2 million she got is just based on one statement because one of his lawyer made one inappropriatly worded claim during their battles. She isnt getting 2m because johnny would hit her too...\n\nThere are texts of him using very abusive language for her and sure thats not nice but nowhere near what she claimed he did. + In situations like that we gotta ask ourselves: is it mutually abusive relationship or is the abused person just fighting back? Cuz you know, if somebody threw vodka bottles at my head, i would also call them nasty things ;) not because i originally would be abusive to them but because, well, i wouldnt react joyfully to being victim of abuser.\n\nAlso johnny had drug problems because drugs are his coping mechanism since childhood. There is no doubt he needed more drugs while being terrorised by her, especially when she didnt let him move away to cope and secure his safety atm,not to mention she was making his recovery much harder by being unsupportive and drinking and using drugs while expectibg him not to + that incident when he went into recovery and she was hurting him rather than helping..",
            "Just to be clear: it's not just tendencies. He's still on record as abuser, and that trial was not overturned or whatever. The lawsuit he won was about whether Heard's accusations harmed his image and career, and had to acknowledge that she told the truth but still ruled that the truth harmed his image and career - rich people's justice, right?\n\nAnyway JD is the idol of a *lot* of people, and AH was the subject of a campaign of partly-fanatic-pro-JD propaganda, and partly just misogynistic \"how dare she speak up\" propaganda. Restoring faith in JD and painting him as \"the true victim\" and \"the good guy\" was a movement about what people wanted to believe.\n\nI'm not saying AH was perfect - there's no such thing in real-life abuse stories, and the \"perfectly behaving victim\" is a myth, no one just takes it. In that story she's still the main victim and efforts to depict it otherwise are for the most part intentionally misleading",

Amber was having a field day getting partnerships and deals, interviews, praises for being a \"strong, independent woman\", won moneys from Depp and simply rode off of it.\n\nIf they were both toxic and at fault, stands to reason both should be held accountable, but as only Depp was antagonized, with recent light that even if they're both tocic people, Amber wad clearly the more excessive one and Depp winning the case is a landmark for justice against domestic abuse and that men can be victims too.

            "Why are you demanding a perfect hero for men's rights instead of a flawed hero?",
            "Which was the dangerous one? Amber. Depp never hit her and all the accusations towards him doing so were lies that were announced in court. It was obvious who was doing the physical abuse. Depp is not a saint. He got angry. He cursed her out and was verbally abusive. But at the end of the day, it's understandable if he was like that towards someone who was constantly hitting him. It's like telling a bullied kid, \"you're also expelled from school because you shouldn't have protected yourself!\"\n\nThe praise is coming from finally bringing out the lies in a civil court instead of taking care of it himself. The lawsuit was about the lies being placed on him. How his life was being ruined by those lies. It wasn't really about the abuse itself. Depp even took responsibility for the things he did. He never denied to his faults in the battles. Amber, however... She fought tooth and nail to deny everything she did. Contradicted herself constantly too. \"I hit him.\" To \"I would never hurt Johnny.\"\n\nThis was about wrapping up loose ends and coming to a final conclusion. Depp has his life back now and Amber's lies are out for the whole world to see. Depp's is also out there, but the difference is how they are handling them. Amber doubles down while Depp admitted faults. That's why he is loved and praised by the people while Amber is literally just a shit in a bed.\n\nAlso... Amber pissed off a LOT of abuse victims. Stole stories. Pretended to have PTSD. No one comes back well from faking something that is a very delicate subject.",

            "My opinion is that they were both pieces of shit, with her as the greater of the two turds because she took it physical, she's the one who the greater guilt is on. I can only imagine how codependent that shitshow of a relationship was. \n\nFrom the perspective that this becomes another precedent in **establishing that males can be victims of domestic abuse: great**, but what I've seen from a lot of people around me is blatant fanboy/fangirling instead.\n\nThe conduct itself of the defense crew highlighted how bad Heard fucked up and could not back the articles of slander with proof. **In an American court involving a jury**, I didn't have any doubts of Depp vindicating his reputation to a reasonable group of people. He doesn't need the money, he needed to be cleared in the public view, and this spectacle delivered.\n\nContrast this to how in 2020, Depp v. News Group Newspapers Ltd turned out in England. Not televised, and the judge shut down Depp's tactic in that case of attacking Heard's character. Thus, the argument there wasn't \"Did Depp Do It,\" but \"Is Heard a credible character capable of making factual statements.\" Whereas in the US trial, Depp did not hide his character flaws, and the argument clearly evolved to \"How shitty are you, Heard? Here's how!\" and the evidence allowed to be presented indeed painted her as the physically abusive one in the relationship. *As soon as gaslighting was revealed in her own words*, that was the first hard nail hammered on for the jury to put the lid on Heard's arguments and pivot from.\n\nI hope that since his divorce, Depp's been able to climb out of whatever hell he fell into. On Heard's part, I have a hard time forgiving people that laid hands on others that loved them. Pain teaches me valuable lessons, otherwise it wouldn't hurt so much, nor remain vivid after so long -that's my body/subconscious way of proactively warning me? I get that fights happen couples bicker, and it can escalate, but to keep going when the other side doesn't want to engage, or is helpless against you is us reverting to something both bestial and the worst of humanity at the same time.\n\nI was three years old, once, unless I was running at two. My first memory was me running in the divide between the sun and shade of the house, followed immediately by me dangling from one arm as my father took a belt to me -I realize that the earlier fragment was significant because that was me fleeing, my first memory was terror, followed by pain. I'm not even refuting that I must have fucked up hard enough to warrant discipline. Just that whatever it was, was obviously not worthy of remembrance compared to me getting my ass beaten by someone my memory identifies as \"father.\" Everything from then on, my view of the man, regardless of what we were doing together was: *you hurt me, and I do not know why*, and I was a good little boy, because I wouldn't do anything around him. The lesson ingrained wasn't don't fuck up, because I can't remember the who-what-when-where-why-and-how, but don't get caught. Every time I begin reacting to a situation with anger that exceeds the severity of the cause, I think to that fear, that pain, and that stops me in my tracks. It's that control that defines us. The ability to step back from instinct, from impulse, and to reason it out. For those that can't control it: I have no respect. Whatever you achieved will be counterweighted by what you inflicted. My father has since reformed himself, so I have heard, enough to return to his legal trade and start a new family. I learned to live without one before age four, and hilariously, the **Church agrees legally**. Let's just say enough shenanigans were going on (corporate embezzlement, gambling bookkeeping, cockfights, that blurry line where provincial government blends into the local mafia, uncle being killed by said provisional government over \"business\" -I view movies like Godfather & Goodfellas differently than others do) that The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Manila granted my mother an annulment within a year of their separation, and that Canons 1137 and 1061 of The Code of Canon Law applies to me fully and everyone from the headmistress to the nun-teachers treated me with kid gloves all the way through Confirmation; they made sure of that before I got on the plane to America. Helped that my Godfather was a lawyer.\n\nI have no tolerance for abusers, let them be revealed and reap their rewards.\n\nDamn, I went on a tangent.\n\n**TL;DR: Depp v. Heard may be a case that will help future male victims of domestic abuse, this US trial, unlike his UK Depp v. News Group Newspapers Ltd: involved a jury, offered evidence media the public was exposed to in a televised spectacle, and terrible conduct by the Heard defense team. Oh, and it could be that more people love Depp's filmography than Heard's, but no, people can't be that shallow...**",

Heard was a trigger for her as her abuser was like that. She said when Depp had his outbursts, she could identify with it, as she too would have outbursts at her abuser after hours of verbal abuse.\n\nDepp admitted to his faults while Heard blamed everyone and their Uncle Bob. Heard was not believable and her evidence was underwhelming. Heard appears to be lying about her abuse and sets herself up as be an abuse spokesperson.

I am an actual survivor of dv two relationships. I documented everything injury went to the doctors for the serious ones took pictures of all my injuries because I know that abusers lie and they can convince people you're lying and your crazy. I've seen it I've lived it. She had horribly violent stories with NO EVIDENCE. It doesn't add up. She got hit repeatedly in the fave with his rings blood everywhere bruises everywhere yet the red carpet pics and the pap pics show NO injuries. She was bleeding from her privates snd didn't seek medical attention??? I highly doubt that. I wasnt punching you i was hitting  you RED FLAG WORDS OF AN ABUSER. THEY ALWAYS MINIMIZE SHIT.

None of this would've happened if she had simply divorced him and walked away. It's comeuppance, plain and simple.\n\nDepp being an asshole and a toxic boyfriend doesn't compare even slightly to physical violence and attempted career destruction. When faced with both facts simultaneously, people will obviously put greater emphasis on the worse of the two, which is Heard.\n\nSimply put, a relationship with Johnny Depp would be him mistreating you until you break up.

He's not a role model by any means but he's an icon of male abuse survivors and that's something we don't see",
            "I think a lot of this is schadenfreude due to the fact that the media was 100% on Amber's side until the trial (and many MSM companies are now questioning the veracity of the recent court decision while in the same breath arguing that the UK court decision somehow proves Depp *was* the primary abuser). Depp faced very real and immediate consequences when he was first accused. People tend to sanctify the underdog, which Depp undoubtedly was.\n\nYes, they were both terrible to each other but I suspect people say this over and over to avoid conceding the fact that AH completely decimated her own credibility and set back efforts to help real DV victims. If you watched the trial, it was evident that AH was by *far* the more abusive of the two.",
            "Lying under oath multiple times and submitting phoney evidence has that effect on people.",
            "In my case its because, in this particular event, we've seen something incredibly uncommon: A Man getting justice against his female abuser.\n\n\nI'm not praising Depp for being a victim, nor am I ignoring the fact that he's not the super awesome fun time great guy that most Celebrities put forward as their public face.\n\nIt's just a case where a guy was able to get his own abuse addressed without inherent societal bias completely fucking him for not \"Being a real man.\"\n\nI have a similar situation that exists in my personal life with my sister's father, we'll call him D for anonymity.\n\nD's a mean drunk, not unlike Johnny is, but when he's sober, hes a genuinely great person and possibly my best and most reliable friend. His problem is that the last three women he's been with have all pressured and abused him in to constantly turning to alcohol and drugs, and he would be ridiculed, attacked and demeaned by everyone he knows for trying to get get clean meant that it took a woman pushing him in to Methamphetamines and hard liquor and manipulating him in to nearly killing one of her Exes for money to keep their happy, drugfueled bliss-fest of a train going for him to finally realize, on trial, that everyone he knew pushed him down in to that hole.\n\nNow, I'm well aware that Johnny and my sister's dad aren't all that similar, but if we can start with small, high-profile wins, then maybe people like D might not come to the realization so far down the road as he did. That they might not have to drop their entire lives for 5 years to detox, gather themselves and genuinely correct the course their lives are on.\n\nD's doing way better now. He's 6 years sober and is working at the program that helped him right himself as an assistant counselor, sharing his story and helping to empower and motivate others who have the same troubles he did.\n\nI'm proud of him and when I see a massively public trial like this one, where despite the extreme backlash from vocal groups of people, a Man was able to set the record straight enough to not have his life thrown entirely off course, gives me hope that things can, in fact, change on more important, more normal levels.",
            "The main reason is because Johnny Depp was presumed guilty by the media at large and dropped from several movie franchises before he ever got a chance to have his day in court. Amber Heard not only had no negative consequences but actually received a career boost from her allegations, the bulk of which seem to have been proved false or exaggerated.\n\nThe trial shoed that not only is Heard a complete psycho who not only regularly physically abused Depp but did so while taunting him over the fact that no one would believe him because he was a man. It also showed that her original allegations, posted in one of the few remaining newspapers with an audience, were fabricated to make him look bad.\n\nIf she had come out in the first place and just said \"Depp is kind of a toxic asshole so we broke up\" there wouldn't have been this kind of fallout. Johnny Depp is obvious a very flawed human being, and was probably more so while on drugs, but he is an absolute saint compared to both how he was portrayed by Amber Heard, and compared to Amber Heard herself.",
            "In addition to many of the great comments here, keep in mind that victims of physical abuse in relationships often must defend themselves. Those defensive actions can appear abusive when viewed in a vacuum, especially when the aggressor is a female and the person defending themselves is male.\n\nI was the victim of an abusive ex, and what convinced me to leave wasn't the abuse I facing, but the fact that, as the male in the relationship, I was going to end up in jail one day if I didn't. This realization came after she was mad at me about something stupid, and I woke up to her sitting on my arms and chocking me on the couch. When I finally got my legs between us and kicked to get her off me, her head nearly went through a wall.\n\nThere were many previous issues like that, and I was sick of the feelings of guilt I had after I was constantly forced to defend myself. I was bigger than her, and I could have hurt her badly if I ever used my full strength, and that scared the shit out of me, because it's really hard to limit your own strength once full on fight or flight has kicked in, and the only way to do either is through someone trying to hurt you. It took me a lot of counseling to figure out that I was a victim there, because society says any time a male hurts a female, it's abusive.\n\nMaking it worse, are the abusers who use physical violence as a reaction to nonphysical actions, then claim \"she made me do it\". That's who I thought I was. \n\nI'm now married in a relationship where we respect each other. She's never so much as raised a hand at me, and as a result, I've never had even the slightest feeling or want to do so. \n\nPeople are welcome to think whatever they want about the Johnny Depp trial, and what kind of person he is. What I know, is that I could see and hear the conflict in his voice as he was talking about some of the things he often did to defend himself. Money, alcohol, and drugs were certainly catalysts, and did not help in this situation. But I truly believe that he's a good person who was in a bad situation.",
            "Well, Depp is what we used to refer to as a harmless drunk. Yes, you're right, he's hardly up for canonization but between the two of them, she's the malicious, vindictive one. And, unlike her, he lost a ton. \n\nIt's pretty obvious that she was the real abuser and it stings us all that much more when the abuser got a pass to play victim because of the current zeitgeist that dictates all women are victims and all men are abusers. \n\nRemember, a year ago *she* was the one up for sainthood so I guess you could think of this as a sort of societal schadenfreude.",
            "This is as shitty as saying it\u2019s a woman\u2019s fault because she was wearing the wrong clothes. Johnny was the victim, no matter what your amateur psychology assessment of him is.\n\nThis is a win for domestic violence victims, no matter their gender.",
            "Because \n1. He was more than likely not an instigator of violence, but a victim of it.\n\n2. Heard actually said \u201ctry and take me, a young blonde white woman to court for DV\u201d\n\n3. Heard threatened to destroy his career using DV accusations\n\n4.  Heard went forth and then faked victimhood by selling a video to TMZ edited to make her look like the good guy,  \n\n5. called paparazzi to meet her at the court house after she filed for divorce\n\n6. Signed her name to an op-Ed in which it made her seem like the sole victim of a misogynistic patriarchal society that protected Depp.\n\n7.  Lied about every major event (and it was proved so)  \n\n8.  Created obviously fake bruise pics as the basis of her evidence.\n\n\nIf anyone attacks you and you defend yourself, it\u2019s not aggression.  The one incident Depp admitted to was kicking heard after the finger incident, because she kept following him and attacking him.\n\nThey were, both, quite abusive.  Nobody can say if Depp was like that because of the relationship or not, however Heard had a previous charge for domestic abuse against a woman.",
            "I think it is a reaction to how appalling she came off during the trial. His team presented a solid case that, not only did Depp not abuse her, but it was *her* who abused *him*.  \n  \nTheir case was then further given credibility when Heard testified and lied multiple times on the stand, frequently contradicting the testimony of other witnesses. Many who watched her at any length could see that she was essentially telling a pack of lies on the stand.  \n  \nIt was quite a shock, given how different this was to the version we\u2019d been fed by the media up to this point.  \n  \nSo people\u2019s disdain and anger towards Heard is because she weaponized the MeToo movement in an attempt to ruin her ex-husband. We feel instinctively hostile towards liars, and liars who capitalize on the traumas of others to destroy an innocent man engender even more hostility.  \n  \nDepp also came across as a rather gentle and passive man, so people feel that it is particularly unjust for him to have been relentlessly attacked as he has. Depp was being abused by this woman so I think we can all cut him a little slack when he sends nasty texts to his friend about her.  \n  \nEdit: note the verdict of the jury. Although they found him to have defamed her via his lawyer, they did not punish him with punitive damages. Heard, on the other hand, was ordered to pay $5m punitive damages by the jury. They could see how egregious her behavior was.",
            "\n>but there's a reason he had to throw in a nice chunk of money too\n\nYes, because his lawyer publicly said some shit he shouldn't have about Heard.",
            ">there's a reason he had to throw in a nice chunk of money too.\n\nYeah, his agent made a defamatory statement about Heard. \n\nAmber Turd's 2 million wasn't because Depp abused her, it was because his former agent was a moron who made public statements in Jonny's name without being able to prove any of it.",
            "The decade after decade of criminal and civil bias courts have against men had been damning and continue to be inexcusable up to this point.  Seeing one man finally get justice against a woman, and not just any woman, an attractive white women - the most protected class of person to ever step into a courtroom - was stunning and riveting for people who know how the so-called justice system treated and continues to treat men.",
            "I don't see any comments yet about how Johnny was fired from jobs, while she wasn't. Even if they're both assholes, that's just pure sexism, so people are happy to see it being more balanced now",
            "Mainly because Johnny didn't really lie about it did he?\nAmber went greatly out of her way to paint Depp as the sole abuser and made up elaborate lies \nThey both weren't good for each other and abused each other in their own ways, but what Amber did was beyond fucked up.",
            "This trial has absolutely nothing to do with Amber and Johnny. Its about a man once canceled being vindicated. And he\u2019s getting awarded damages. So if someone accuses me and I lose my house and job, but I didn\u2019t do anything, now I can sue her for defamation and damages. \n\nMen are happy that this is going to be a turning point in the cancel culture movement. People should be held accountable, but some people and organizations were getting a little ban happy with the ban hammer. This should be a turning point.",
            "Actually I think Depp was an addict and an alcoholic. Abusive tendencies are not what people think. .. \nHe was extremely open and candid about his actions on the stand ( not typical of an abusive man) \nHe was accountable about his actions ( not typical for an abusive man) abusive men are not even capable of being accountable or being honest about their actions or anyone else\u2019s. Just that, takes him completely off the table of being an abusive man. \n\nI think a lot of people who are not educated about abuse tend to assume a lot\u2026. And anytime a man gets angry or reacts they think it\u2019s abuse. ..\n\nBut abuse is defined as undeserved. So\u2026 a typical victim of DV will tell you that they get abused when they ask their husband to take out the trash, or when he gets out of the shower and realizes they ran out of shampoo. Abuse happens for no logical reason, there is no inciting abuse. There is no nothing that comes before a truly abusive situation - although recently they have expanded that definition because some men do get abusive if a woman incites him in different ways- but for me? I think that\u2019s more an anger problem and not the real deal abusive man. \nBecause for example- Amber? Or any woman, who is horrible to a man\u2026. And that man reacts and gets angry - and does things like throws something or punches a cupboard- that is not an abusive man. Everyone would get angry at a situation that\u2019s unfair , manipulative or cruel. But lots of people think- well a man got angry and I\u2019m a woman- so it\u2019s abuse. \nBULLSHIT. That\u2019s exactly what Amber was trying to say\u2026 but - That\u2019s an angry man, that\u2019s a guy with  maybe an anger problem, that could even be a guy who \u2026 is immature and toxic - but at the end of the day- he had a normal reaction ( anger) to an unfair situation - we all would if we were him.\u2026. \nbut he isn\u2019t abusive. \nBecause of his addiction and alcoholism he had less control over his actions and he still didn\u2019t abuse her- that\u2019s a huge cardinal sign he isn\u2019t in any way an abuser. \n\nTrue abusers have personality disorders that characterize them as men who enjoy hurting women\u2026. Who enjoy controlling and manipulating women \u2026 who get off on hurting people and terrorizing them, and who get their self esteem and self worth and emotional security- from hurting , controlling and manipulating women. \n\nSo an abuser is going to create a reality about the woman, that isn\u2019t true. So he will say she did things she didn\u2019t do, he will say she said things she didn\u2019t say. He will say she behaved in a way that she didn\u2019t \u2026. And he does that intentionally - to steal who she is away from her- and to create a vicious cycle of the victim constantly trying to get him to validate her reality. \n\nDepp doesn\u2019t strike me at all like an abusive man. In fact , he shows some distinctive signs he is the opposite of an abusive man. I think almost all victims of DV saw that too\u2026 and I think Amber did a huge injustice for victims of DV\u2026 because she was actually the abuser and she invited anger and did things and said things to bring him to the brink of himself/ which is actually more like an abuser. \n\nTo me, Amber is the abuser\u2026. And I also think abusers - esp ones that hit women in the face for example- only the very very worst abusers do- and they are the guys that end up killing their partners. So a man that would hit a woman on the face - ok- they are what\u2019s considered a pathologically violent abuser. Less than 5% of abusers hit on the face. So \u2026 it isn\u2019t possible to become that at the age of 60- when men typically calm down- even the worst abusers at the age of 50\u2026 the height of his abusive behavior would have been when he was young- and he has no history of abuse\u2026 \nAmber also couldn\u2019t produce one witness to the abuse- which - abusers like that? Always have witnesses and well documented cases with lots of evidence of them being violent and abusive - not just to women. \nThere would have been a plethora of evidence to show his abusive tendencies\u2026 esp at the age of 60. \nBecause abusers - are created when they are young\u2026. And there is no cure, no medication they can take to cure it. \nIt is something they will always be\u2026. Personality disorders are incurable. And esp when you have a mix of them that create an abuser. \nHe would have had issues with every ex , at his jobs, with his family. It would have been an issue all the time. \n\nShe essentially proved he isn\u2019t an abuser and never has been.",
            "If you had watched the trial you would know that Johnny wasn\u2019t abusive to her, only himself. Texting things and venting to a friend is not even on the same planet as the things Amber did to him. The amount of people saying they were both abusive is baffling",
            "So like the average guy going into a divorce usually gets fucked. No real other way of putting it. I think they see this as a victory for themselves. Just an outside perspective, because idk if I see a lot of Johnny Depp praise. But I see a tremendous amount of Amber Heard hate. She represents something a lot of men have dealt with and the legal system notoriously tends to side with them even with overwhelming evidence of the contrary.",
            "He had to pay a, relatively, minuscule amount because the Jury didn\u2019t believe his lawyer\u2019s claim that the whole thing was a conspiracy by Amber & her friends and that they faked a crime scene. Nothing to do with whether or not he was toxic himself.",
            "Because he was a victim of domestic violence and abuse. Not that hard to understand. Anyone who claims not to is being intentionally obtuse after all this time.",
            "For me, the problem is that she clearly instigated a lot if not most of the fights and ALWAYS gave as good as she got. Just because he's a man doesn't mean he was the main perpetrator.",
            "I realize this won't get seen, but I've wanted to express this for awhile. Some \"progressive\" media outlets have been saying Amber is the clear victim here, and her so called lies were just inconsistencies because she couldn't remember every detail. HER toxic behavior was clear retaliation from the brutal bearings HE had already inflicted on her. She only started acting like that after she'd finally given up trying to fix him. Idk what to think, but I know this. I had been following what Reddit has to say about this, in the year before this trial. Reddit completely flipped sides when a particular video of her came out. It's the one where she said something like, \"go ahead and tell people I hit you, no one will believe you anyway.\" According to her, and her supporters she had decided to fight fire with fire by that point, and she had already been enduring brutal beatings from him for awhile. I'm not 100% sure what to believe honestly, but I know those words from her lost the majority of the Internet. I think it really triggered a lot of men who had heard similar words, and felt powerless. After that video came out, I've rarely seen anyone in the entire site defend her. Everyone seemed to have decided that because of that video, nothing else she has said can possibly be true. I'm not so sure, honestly. With the evidence I've seen, I simply can't make a judgment either way, and I believe it's equally possible one or both was doing the things the other claimed. I do think Reddit formed an uncompromising hate mob toward her from then on out though, and no amount of evidence at this point will convince them. I swear if actual brutal footage of him beating her came out, Reddit would find a way to dismiss it at this point. The hate boner is out of control",
            "This is the story about the little boy, in this case woman  crying wolf. She was caught in a lie multiple times, so now most people do not believe anything she says. So even if Johnny did hit her a few times, he can get away  with it.  She dug her own hole, and ruined her reputation.",
            "While a fair and valid point to be taken, it goes to show that everything is not a cut and clear case. \n\nMy ex wife abused me for years. Stealing money for pills, selling computer equipment, loading my work and personal credit cards to her phone so she could shop and return stuff, slamming me with hair dryers, curling irons and related items, stealing my truck and disappearing for days, kicking in my window at my house and bringing over \u201cfriends\u201d to block me from my house. \n\nBut when I grab her purse and take out the cash I just caught her pulling out of my safe, it\u2019s assault. \n\nThat was the end for me.",
            "I think this shitty point only comes up when the abused person is male and you'd never dare to point that out otherwise\nIn all toxic relationships there is toxicity from both parties\nHowever there is one person who mainly manipulates and gaslight the other person and drives him into insanity and we all saw the evidence on who that was\nImagine after hearing about the chris brown and rihanna situation I was like well I'm sure rihanna was toxic too in that relationship\nIt doesn't matter chris brown should be held accountable because no matter whatever rihanna did in the relationship what he did is awful and should be punished\nIf you think it's not the same thing rihanna got beat up and probably was physically okay after like a month However depp's finger tip is gone after she threw a fucking vodka bottle on him\nHow much does it take untill we stop it with double standards?",
            "As a male survivor of domestic abuse it was weird to watch. One side of me wanted the whole \u201cmen are finally believed and not made fun of\u201d aspect but they were both terrible. It just so happens that she made videos about getting his money and he was cancelled over a two way toxic street.\n\nIn a perfect world neither would get money and both would be cancelled, and to say them being cancelled is cancel culture is okay. People with substance abuse or abuse history should have a wake up call. If depp or heard got the help they needed they could legitimately have the best years of their career ahead of them. I know little of their current issues, but a fair amount of their past issues. Both needed help, and I imagine they both still do.",

            "To answer your question, Depp is not being hailed as not being a toxic person. He was abusive to a set of cabinets after finding out either his mother died or that a company stole 250 million from him. Did he get drunk/used drugs and pass out? Yes.  was he toxic that he abused drugs? Yes. These are all well known from the trial. Yes, he has admitted to these things and has not shied away from it.\n\nWhat everyone is praising, not him, but the fact that he proved he was the one that was physically abused and not Amber. She admitted on audio that she was the abusive one. Additionally he proved that he has not sexually abused her as she stated. These were all serious offenses that he could not allow happen.  There was no medical records, none, of any physical or sexual abuse but Johnny had a long list of medical records proving he was physically abused. Even the stories that her team told we filled with inaccuracies and falsehoods. They could not line up where or who was involved in certain \"encounters\".  3 people had different recollections of they same \"encounter\". When no one can keep a stories straight, they are lying. Even her own testimony from begining to end morphed into this amalgamation of lies. She slipped up many times in statements from the beginning to present day. She slipped and implicated that TMZ was tipped when later they proof that they own the copyright. Which can only be supplied from the source. She stated from the begining that she never wrote the opp ed about johnny but then admits that she did it on the stand.\n\nAs for Ambers recent statements, she has said that this has set back the movement for women. Not men and women, just women on being abused. Do I think it has? The more people that still believe she was the abused and not the abuser, will set it back. The more people that state that they stand up for people that have been abused but side with an abuser, will set back the movement. \n\nAlso, before anyone states that Amber won in the UK, she was not a defendant in that trial. She was a witness. It was Depp vs The Sun. And with reviews of this trial, there have been plenty issues with what Americans call due process. The judge had personal ties to The Sun. His wife was friends with Heard. But yet he did not remove himself. Additionally, he sided many times with The Suns team on many instances when he shouldn't have.  Then promptly \"retired\" after the denial of the appeal.\n\nAll in all, what is being praised here is justice. The facts proved that you cannot lie to further your career and expect to not be brought to justice. Unfortunately, Heard has given a black eye to all the abused that want to come forward. She has done what all their abusers have don't to them time and time again. The media sided with her and even after all this they still side with her as they forced this narrative. If it wasn't for the video/live stream of this trial, the truth would of been mishandled but the same types of people that during interviews with Heards lawyer, Elaine, the first question asked is how is Amber feeling. They ask the person who defended an abuser how the abuser is feeling. This is like asking Bill Cosbys lawyer how Bill is taking it that he's lost and going to jail. Or asking Harvey how he feels that so many women stood up to him for their abuse.\n\nThe problem is, there should be due process. You have to be innocent till be proven guilty.",
            "If you expected him to stay composed and calm 100% of the time in a abusive relationship you're insane. Every single person has a limit and sometimes it's overboard. You're an idiot if you think that's even possible.",
            "I don\u2019t think he\u2019s innocent, but I don\u2019t believe he\u2019s done anything close to what Amber has done. At least not based on the things I\u2019ve seen or heard. Sure, I believe he can be a drunken asshole. But the problem I have with this whole thing is how she lied, physically abused him, and set out to ruin his life while claiming to be the victim. Fuck that. It doesn\u2019t excuse any shitty behavior from him, but in this instance I don\u2019t think any of that is totally relevant since he essentially had his life taken away. Don\u2019t have to like him, don\u2019t have to think he\u2019s a saint. Just don\u2019t sit here and tell me he deserves what she did to him and that she deserves nothing for what she did. \n\nI can accept two people contributed to a toxic relationship. But when one tries to paint the other as the one and only bad guy, and completely lies about him, then I have an issue.",
            "I think it's weird that people are almost infantilizing him and making every little thing he does a character analysis. However, I think the praise for him is a response is to what she accused him of. We've been here for 6 years since the allegations started.  She's accused him of some gnarly-ass stuff, including being sexually assaulted with a bottle. The lies she told are brutal. The act she put on was brutal. It makes me wonder what else she's done and lied about.  I know Johnny Depp is a dirtbag but in my opinion he is NOWHERE near as culpable as Heard.   She's a dirtbag who deserves the vitriol being hurled at her.",

He would just leave or lock himself in a room.",
            "People don\u2019t like being tricked. \n\nWhen the story first broke out, Heard took advantage of \u201cme too\u201d and claimed she fell into that category too.

            "The better question is why is every major media outlet now publishing articles about the verdict setting back women\u2019s rights? How about articles that focus on women lying and using the system to bring down men? There are none of those articles. \n\nI\u2019m neutral on Depp. He is probably an alcoholic and a bit of an asshole. But that\u2019s NOT the issue. The issue is whether he physically abused Amber Heard. There is NO chance that she would have failed to take a picture of abuse. The abuse she described would not be subtle. She recorded many, many things but never got any evidence of physical abuse. She\u2019s a liar. Women telling the truth are in no danger. What do the idiots who write these articles want? Men to be locked up immediately on a woman\u2019s word with no evidence? Anything less than that sets back women? Give me a break!",
            "Why did Amber Heard deserve to pay up?? The case should never have been a referendum on her personality. It was a defamation case based upon the question of whether one single sentence that never even mentioned his name had any basis in truth. If he was toxic/abusive in any way, the suit should have been dismissed, end of discussion.",

            "if the roles reversed, and Turd is truly a victim, would you have said the same thing?",
            "He\u2019s a man",
            "Because anyone that has been in an abusive relationship realizes that being abused everyday changes you. You don't get to be yourself anymore. As a person that struggles with drug addiction, Johnny is even more susceptible to it. This was what made the testimony of his exs so important. His recent behavior and outbursts happened in the vacuum of his relationship with Amber.\n\nIt's not a matter of good guy, bad guy. It's cause and effect.\n\nBy the admission of others, Johnny has treated his friends and exs with respect and kindness. You're looking for Johnny to be an innocent guiltless party so you can cleanly rally against amber and it's just not the case. He's made mistakes and he's pretty open about them. But there is no question who the victim is in this equation.",
            "Yes THANK YOU finally someone who can think. It's because he has such a great PR team. Can we please give it up for the people behind the curtain who, day in and day out, work endlessly to make sure the public image of a celebrity is positive. Those people work god damn hard just to make sure my favorite actors/artists/comedians stay in work. Because let's be honest everyone is a trash human being if you dig hard enough. Ghandi taught us that.",
            "Because the evidence proved she was usually, if not always, the primary physical abuser in the relationship. \n\nEverything she brought as evidence turned out to be weak, doctored, fake, or false, and she was her own worst enemy in court. \n\nShe's apparently an awful person to everyone around her, friends and family alike. Too many people had stories to tell about her that supported Johnny's side, even some of her own witnesses. \n\nContrary to what many are saying, she is no tiny fragile flower but about equally-sized with him, and all the recordings, both hers and his, prove she had no fear of him.  Who buys their accuser a knife?  Who sticks around to film after he catches you filming secretly?  \n\nHis friends and family showed a consistent pattern with him going back to childhood in which domestic fights caused him to withdraw and try to get away, and she would not allow him to do it, instead chasing him from room to room and banging on doors to make him continue fighting. She's like Jack Nicholson in the Shining. \n\nShe was apparently carrying on an affair with James Franco , yet Franco did not get asked to testify for her?  Why not? Apparently she had him over to the penthouses over 30 times while Johnny was gone filming. There's elevator footage. I guess after Jason Momoa torpedoed her, they were too gun shy to approach Franco.\n\nShe pledged millions of dollars to charity and never actually donated it, for 13 months after receiving the money, and still hasn't paid it, blaming it on Johnny, who gave her the millions of dollars in the first place. \n\nShe broke up his relationship and family with Vanessa. \n\nWe heard her on tape ridiculing him, admitting that she hit him, mocking him for being upset and for thinking he's a domestic abuse victim, and daring him to tell the world about it and see if anyone believes him, because he's a man.\n\nShe acted innocent about all the drugs and drinking, but later in the trial she admitted under oath to drinking and using drugs right along with him. \n\nEven her own sister, who testified for her, was proven by several witnesses to have been afraid of her over the years, and a victim of her physical abuse. \n\nShe has a history of previous physical abuse with her ex-girlfriend. \n\nShe shit in the bed and blamed it on a dog. \n\nShe sat in court and gasped, heaved, shook, moaned, but never one tear. Her acting coach testified that she has trouble crying on cue as an actress. \n\nBut logically speaking, even if you don't believe any of that, one of the criteria for defamation is that anyone who read the Op-Ed would know that it was about Johnny. Multiple people, including a successful Hollywood agent/manager whose name escapes me at the moment, said that it was obvious to everyone and immediately hurt his casting and profit potential. She repeatedly denied that it was about Johnny or that it was obviously about Johnny - and then, right there on the stand near the end of the trial, she said that everyone comes out of the woodwork to support Johnny, and \"that's why I wrote it about him.\"  Sorry, right there, regardless of the rest of it, is her confession that she has been lying all along about the Op-Ed. \n\nShe wrote it about him, failed to prove he had physically abused her, and wrote it with malice, intending to hurt or end his career. That is defamation, so the jury was right to side with Johnny. \n\nAlso, I am sick and tired of her putting herself out there as the poster child for domestic abuse victims. She said in the op-ed that she was the main face of domestic abuse survivors, um, what? I honestly  never even had heard of her until this trial.  Does no one remember that she just fired her PR team and hired a new one? And now coincidentally all these articles and journalists have jumped on the bandwagon to condemn Johnny and talk about how he shouldn't have won, that it's a huge setback for women, and it isn't.  She doesn't represent women. She sure as hell doesn't represent me. She isn't worthy to represent abused women, or to be concerned about future accusers and their rights, because she has done more than anything to damage their credibility. I'm also sick of being called an apologist or fangirl because of my support of Johnny. No. I grew up in a family like this. I recognize it. I see right through her. I'm pretty far left, and in no way a conservative or incel supporter, and in most of these MeToo cases I am firmly on the side of the woman, but not this one. \n\nwhew, I have had that all pent up for a week now.",

            "Nobody is perfect and the relationship was clearly toxic. But from everything that was shown in the courtroom evidence, we saw a Johnny who was struggling with his inner demons through substance abuse and we saw him slamming some cabinets at his absolute peak moment of anger. Additionally he wrote some somewhat disturbing text messages to a friend of his about amber. But not a single piece of evidence of abuse against Amber on his part was found.\n\nMeanwhile we found plenty evidence of insane verbal abuse from Heard, physical abuse that led to the severing of Johnny's fingertip, constant gaslighting, lies and manipulation from Heard. All around this woman bears all the marks of a narcisstic abuser to the point of staging false abuse allegations to ruin Johnny's life.\n\nOne does not compare to the other, and that is why Johnny, comparatively, looks like a saint",
            "there are no winners when a relationship turns as toxic as theirs\n\nthey both detest the other, yet I guess the thing was she said he physically and sexually abused her, claims she couldn't prove\n\nI don't doubt by the end he was a fucking prick...but when someone you live with hates the fuck out of you enough to shit in your bed, it's hard to be friendly",
            "I think it's also because Amber Heard played the victim role (Which she still does) while she was clearly at least just as toxic as Johnny Depp and as the trial proved she was more abusing than he was. And she tried to cash in on an article she didn't even wrote herself and she did a huge disservice to many women worldwide.",

            "You obviously didn\u2019t read the actual verdict of the trial if you think Johnny depps attorney making him liable for that 1 case of defamation means that he was obviously giving tendencies of a toxic/abusive person. Literally amber\u2019s own attorneys said she\u2019d win if he couldn\u2019t prove he abused her once and although this isa case where there isn\u2019t a guilty not guilty Johnny depp not only cleared that hurdle enough to get the original sum but even more so to get the jury to fine her an extra 5 mill.

            "Men having short hair ia actually really really new. Like 1800s new. Before that long hair and even wigs were what men would wear. \n\nIt is true tho that in many places women having longer hair was fashionable. Having super long hair that took time to be brushed and braided or styled was a sign of nobility. If you had money for things like brushes and time for people to style your hair you were probably rich. \n\nIn culture's where there wasn't as much class division like some native Americans tribes both men and women have long hair and wear a lot of the same styles. Others cultures  are just the opposite and both wear shaved styles or short styles. \n\nOne of the main reasons  it became popular for men to have cut hair is the need for men to wear helmets and gas masks as weapons became more advanced. AND for all the men to look more alike. If all the hair is different lengths and styles it becomes really easy to pick someone out as a target. And if everyone looks alike and has to adhere to the same grooming standards it makes it easier to get them to cooperate with each other, you don't look at a guy and say and see his sleek shiny waist length hair ans think \"man that guy is a rich little sissy\" you just see another dude in the same situation without preconceived bias",

And losing their heads.\n\nIn England, English men stopped using wigs because they were against paying wig-axes.\n\nNeoclasicism had a huge role in short hair too, as men wanted to emulate the ancient Greek and Roman fashions.\n\nWomen hair was associated with purity, fertility, feminoty and class.

            "Historically, this isnt entirely accurate.\n\nLonger hair, for both sexes, had prevailed in many cultures... hygiene wasnt the greatest, but cleanliness was a thing; as such, hair and status went hand in hand, the richer you were, the more likely you were able to maintain those luscious locks.\n\nBut that isnt the full picture either, I'm not going to say that all cultures did this at any particular period, but from what I do know, it can also be interpreted as a  fashion trend - *I know, shocking, right?* but seriously fashions always been a thing, so luscious locks have always been in... even when romans said not to those luscious locks when it came to war.\n\nHowever, it is when comes to early modern history. And more specifically, warfare; from here it's somewhat western dominant: military style haircuts came for the men going to war. Those trenches were nasty business. Hygiene standards couldn't be met, so, if longer hair attracts lice, cut it off; those shorter hairstyles prevailed. The returning men looked \"prim and proper\" as the military man was respected. Since then, shorter hairstyles dominated mens fashion.\n\nIt wasnt a case of womens hair has to be long only, but being a sign of status of both men and women, it stuck around; and since women werent expected to fight wars, it was never expected for women to cut their hair, and it stuck.\n\nBut that's not to say that there is a not societal aspect to women having long hair to be seen as womanly, and although I cant really think of the specifics at the moment, it has its influence on gender expectations.",

The insurance agent can give an educated guess to what the rating (which determines premium cost) will be but at the end of the day it's up to the underwriters.\nIt looks like someone else mentioned group policies from work which when there is some minimal underwriting (usually any death benefit over $50k if I remember correctly) only a couple basic questions are asked, smoking being one of them.\nTo summarize, smoking is the only guaranteed thing to affect your life insurance rating.",

The bottom line (after a ton of reading and debating) was that it would be immoral/wrong to charge tobacco smokers more for health insurance because it\u2019s a slippery slope to saying the same for alcoholism/addiction/obesity/and a bunch of things that eventually would make insurance unavailable to most humans. It\u2019s not right that they do this and I\u2019m sorry we haven\u2019t caught in enough to stop these companies from charging us extra for so little in return.",

            "Complete personal opinion, but I think smoking is just more stigmatized. Processed meats are labeled a level one carcinogen, along with cigarettes. Heart disease is the leading cause of death (I think) in the US. So in my mind it\u2019s not logical to charge more for smoking and not also charging more for obesity. \n\nBut I think another layer of complexity is that a lot of people struggle with weight, and because of genetics some people\u2019s struggles are harder than others. There\u2019s also a lot of fat shaming, giving people with weight issues mental health issues of anxiety and depression. So making people feel bad for their weight by making them pay extra in their insurance doesn\u2019t really seem logical to me either, which contradicts my earlier point lol.\n\nSo, I think that\u2019s why there\u2019s no up charge for obesity. Smoking is easy, most people hate it and it\u2019s harmful to health. But for what we eat it\u2019s just too complicated and no one can figure out the correct way to do it without causing added harm to people who struggle with obesity.",

So instead of going to that school, I had to attend another one that ended up taking over 90 minutes to get to by school bus with all the stops. \n\nThis led to me, a 12 year old kid, having to wake up at 5:00am to catch my school bus at 5:30 so that we could make it to school with a sufficient amount of time.",

From my middle school to high school, it was a 6:45 start time and I had to wake up at 5 to be ready (I've never been a morning person, but still). Many schools had early morning events like band practices, and those started *before* then at 6am sharp.\n\nI later came to realize how unhinged from reality one had to be to think that teens and pre-teens were just lazy and bad at making schedules they had no input on. But Americans always find a way to blame systemic issues on personal moral failing.",

            "The real reason behind early start times for US high schools is not academic related, but sports and extra-curriculars. I had baseball practice every day after school when I was in high school and I wouldn't get home until 6 or 7. That's with our school starting at 7:45, we even had a Zero-Hour Gym Credit that if you wanted to wake up and get to school by 6:30, you could work out.",

It's only recently in the area where I live that they changed this to a later time.  It was the norm in the Orlando area of Florida for a very long time.  \n\nThere are high schools in the US that start this early.  Some of it was due to the fact that some teens have jobs, so if school ends at 2:15 or 2:30 pm then they have more time with their job.",
            "My middle school started the earliest, 2 hrs before elementary and 1 before the high school. We definately had to be up at 5:45 because you'd better not miss the bus that comes at 6:15 to pick you up\nAlso, ending school at 3:30 sounds really foriegn to me. Wouldn't it be preferrable to have more time in the afternoon after school?",
            "It can be brutal. In high school, I was on the far edge of the school's pickup area and one of the first pickups, so I had to leave my house no later than 6 to be at the bus stop by 6:15 and spend the better part of an hour on the bus to school, with first bell at 7:30.

Is it just the vibration of molecules? Is it the vibration of our inner ear? Is it a certain type of experience people have? For that matter, how can we know anything occurs without observing it? Is inductive reason a valid way to gain knowledge? How can we know?",
            "Like many philosophical questions, it's really a question about what words mean. Does \"sound\" require a human to perceive it to be sound?

            "The point of philosophical questions isn't really to have an *answer*, but to disrupt the way you think about things. In fact these types of questions are philosophical *because* they don't have an answer. \n\nThis one in particular is usually about \"if you didn't actually witness it happen...did it happen?\" You can usually assume it just fell over but without hard proof, it could have been anything that felled the tree. A lightning strike? A bear pushed it over? A storm? Tiny gnomes?  \n\nHere's another question; If you've not seen the Eiffel Tower **with your own eyes**, are you sure it's actually real? Is it possible someone's pulling a hoax on you? You've never seen it yourself, only in pictures (which can be faked) and heard about it from people (which could lie). So you can't be 100% sure it exists, but it does...or does it? If it doesn't exist to you, does it still exist? If I've never heard/seen/smelled/felt your cat, (for me) does that cat actually exist?\n\nLet's go even deeper; You'll never be able to definitively prove that **you're** not the only being in the universe with consciousness. You can see other people *act* like they have free will and consciousness, but you can't prove they aren't elaborate programs and you're the only one that's actually \"awake\". \n\nWant to go deeper? Okay. Maybe YOU don't have free will. Maybe every decision you make has already been **determined**. When you go to the fridge to get lunch, you end up getting a burrito...did you actually pick that burrito? Your liver tells you that your sugar levels are good so your body **determined** it needed something savory. You don't like onions because that one time you were a kid and you got sick on them, so that **determines** you'll pick one of the four burritos without onions. You just watched a video last night about the horrors of factory farming and you're going vegetarian for the day, that narrows it down to two burritos. The cheese burrito is in purple packaging, and purple is your favorite color, so you pick that one. So, did you actually *pick* the burrito? Or were you predisposed, or **predetermined**, to pick out that cheese burrito for lunch? \n\nWait, you want to go even deeper? Yikes. Alright. So, I like the color purple. Who's to say that my purple is the same as yours? Sure, we both see a color and agree that it's purple but who's the say we are both seeing the same thing? We only experience the world through stimuli and our brains process that stimuli. For all you know, a person sitting next to you sees the world as a horrible hellscape full of pain and misery. Or they might be seeing the world as wonderful things...but it's 2021, it's likely the first one. \n\nThere are hundreds of philosophy questions designed to challenge your perception of the world.

            "In philosophy, there's a branch called epistemology. Epistemology is all about asking the question: how do we know what we know? It's simultaneously one of the most surface level intro to philosophy areas there is, while also remaining pretty unresolved despite millennia of people trying to find concrete answers.\n\nThe question isn't about whether or not a tree made a sound, it's a question about how you know that the tree made the sound.  How can you be sure of a sensory experience you weren't there to experience. Even if you are confident that it made a sound, at what confidence could you identity the sound it made? At what level of uncertainty can you reasonably nullify any certainty at all?\n\nYou can understand the physics at play, you can understand the logistics of sound waves bouncing off matter and resting assured that a sound did happen, but unless you are there to hear it, you are only assuming. \n\nOf course, this assumption is reasonable. Doubt is a huge part of epistemology, but once you gain enough knowledge of something there is such a thing as unreasonable doubt. So consider other stimulus: if you lost your ability to smell and taste, how would you ever know a apple still tastes the same? If a perceptible change was found across all apples during your stunted senses, would you know? If you got your sense of taste back, would you even recognize the change is different? Is memory a reliable proof for epistemological questions? \n\nIf you don't remember a year of you life, did that year happen? If you have a wet dream and orgasm in the night was it a pleasurable experience, or is it just messy, unpleasant, clean up? Even if you can prove an experience via recording your brain activity, what difference does it make to you?\n\nIf you find these to be easy questions to answer, I await seeing your name as assigned reading.",

So does a \u2018tree\u2019 actually exist as a tree, and not in a state of probability as atoms, until a conscious observer measures/engages with it?",
            "Let's say you hear someone utter the question you just posted in the title: \"If a tree falls in the forest and nobody is around to hear it, does it make a sound?\"     \nAnd promptly someone who you know is an idiot answers: \"Well, obviously. You do not need to observe the source of sound waves passing through air.\" (Kind of like you did in your post, too)     \n      \nNow you just look at him and **really** don't want him to be right. So you start nitpicking at the question and come up with a  few ways to question his answer.     \nI. \"Sound\"     \nYou, as the other, imaginated person answering this question, know what constitutes sound in a layman-scientific conversation. It's what happens when an object creates waves in the air that will get interpreted by our brains to be what we call \"sound\".    \nNow you may already ask: But if \"sound\" will only be \"sound\" when there is a brain to process is to be \"sound\", what happens if no one is around to hear it? I mean, there definitely is a difference between an object creating waves in the air when no one is around to observe it acoustically, and when someone is around to do that. Right?    \n     \nLet's go even further: You might successfully argue: Hey, waves in the air aren't \"SOUND\" because \"SOUND\" is what we call waves in the air when we perceive them. After this, another door opens:\n     \nII. \"Tree\"     \nWhat are trees? Well, you say, they're made of matter and are alive (at least somewhat) and use photosynthesis to produce energy to keep growing and whatnot.    \n    \nBut what if... You can question their existence? What is it that is telling you that a tree exists, should you stand before one? It's not  a god given gift to feel within you that a tree is near, but it's your senses that are telling you: Green leafes, brown bark, kinda tall and slim.... Yep tree!    \n    \nHowever, weren't there cases where your senses lied to you? Obviously, there were. And what stops senses from lying to you nonstop? I mean, you surely wouldn't be able to differentiate from \"reality\" and illusion, given that all you have experienced so far is illusion, right? So who knows, maybe it wasn't a tree that fell over in the first place. There is no tree. Right?    \n     \nThen you smirk, tell the others that they've obviously missed 2500 years of epistemological advancements in philosophy and that they need to do their homework and *definitely* need to read Plato, Descartes, Hume and Kant before they even dare talk to you again.    \n    \nThat is philosophy. Or at least a weird, overblown caricature of it.",
            "\"Someone doesn't need to hear or see something happen for it to have happened. \"\n\nThat's exactly the assertion that's being examined here. There are schools of philosophy that say, \"without an observer we can't claim anything has happened\". You're using common sense, philosophers aren't required to do so. :)",
            "I\u2019ve always liked: *If a tree falls in a forest, and it crushes a mime to death- does anyone really care?*",
            "If a tree falls on a florist, does he make a sound?",
            "If there is no observer..then the tree isn't even generated by the simulation so no, it does not make a sound.",
            "This is a slightly longer explanation so bear with me, but I can answer this from a neuroscience background. \n\nThis whole thing makes the distinction between physics and perception. Sound itself is not a physical phenomenon, it is a perceptual one, just like color. It is our brain interpreting signals that our eyes pick up and turn into electrical impulses. Let me explain:\n\nWhen a tree falls in the forest it creates a pressure wave. If there is nobody or nothing around to hear and interpret that pressure wave as a \u201csound\u201d then it never becomes anything but a pressure wave. Merely particles of air closer together or further apart alternating back and forth. We can measure two main physical properties of this\u2026pressure and frequency. Our brain decodes these to volume and pitch.\n\nWhen there is somebody present to listen, suddenly those physical attributes are heard and interpreted as sound. Sound as we understand it is formed entirely in the brain as a way to decode and make use of those pressure waves.\n\nTherefore you might ask, if a tree falls in the forest and there is nobody around to interpret the resulting pressure wave, can we say that it makes a sound?\n\nDoes a perceptual phenomenon exist if there is nobody to perceive? To me the question centers around the word sound and what we understand sound to be.  \n\nThanks for reading!",
            "If I snap my fingers while alone in a room, and it is completely silent, I have witnessed this event but no one else. I can tell people it made no sound, but they will claim that there's no possible way that happens. But, it's impossible to make a 100% sure argument that it didn't happen, because you weren't there to witness the event. Perhaps, through some divine intervention or supernatural event, my snap made no sound. I can't prove it didn't make a sound, but you can't prove it did. All you can say is that every other snap that you have seen has made a sound, but you cannot prove that a snap that you didn't witness made a sound.",
            "Edit: I always see this phrase as \"if a tree fall in the middle of the forest and no one sees or hears it, did that really happen?\" Instead of \"did it make a sound\"\n\nHaven't seen anyone talk about this yet, so here goes.\n\nThis is called metaphysics. The question is one from many questions which focus on a bigger question, which is\n\nIs something what it really is, or is it what it's perceived to be? If something is A, but is perceived as B does that mean it's both A and B? Or does it mean it was always B? Or maybe the perceiver is wrong, but does that mean things have an invariable essence? If I take a wall clock and use it as a plate, does it become a plate? What if everyone in the world starts using wall clocks as plates, do they then become plates? So did they change what they were? Were they always plates? And if you say they're still clocks, how do you know that? What if they were something else entirely and viewing it as a clock is simply our current perception?\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo the question in essence is, is something what it's perceived as or is something what it really is, and if it is what it really is, how can we know what it is? \n\nYou say the tree fell, but that's a tree you're aware of because of the question. But really think about it. A tree might have fallen down two seconds ago, did that fall happened to you? And if it didn't happen to anyone, how can we know it actually happened?\n\nI really love this question because other philosophical question makes people go \"wow\" but this one makes people go \"this is dumb\" when it is really very deep.",

Like when we talk about climate change ending the world we don't mean earth will literally explode, but we implicitly take the position that earth becoming an uninhabitable venus like hell world and all higher life forms going extinct as a result would be a bad thing and make earth inherently worse than if it still had us on it. \n\nbut from a philosophical purspective it begs the question why?

Me personally I like it when there is a form of normalcy to conversations. Like being able to laugh and joke around feels so good when you are grieving.\n\nJust like knowing you are there is also enough for me. People tend to shy away in a sense when you deal with things like death in the family, to seem respectful, but just being there and having a sense of normalcy feels actually a lot better than people realise. You don't really have to say anything, and don't worry about saying the wrong thing. Unless you make cancer jokes, or jokes about his dad dying, I really don't think you can say anything wrong.\n\nLike thinking about other things can feel like a relief. Like maybe talk about his interest? Have you seen anything lately that reminded you of him? Silly stupid stuff can actually help a lot. You don't have to be serious, and you don't have to talk about his dad. If he wants to talk about that, then he will probably say so when he is ready.\n\nAt least when I lost my dad, I didn't really talked so much about it, because people treated me so differently and weird, so I actually felt uncomfortable. My best-friend at the time, however treated me just like she had always done, and when I wanted to talk about my dad or when I was sad, I just asked if we could talk and she let me have that space. It was amazing. And she helped me so much with dealing with the grief.\n\nShe didn't do anything special, but I just instinctively knew she was there, I could always count on her, and when I wanted her to listen, she was there. Otherwise it was pretty much normal.\n\nMaybe it is different between a best-friend and a romantic relationship, but I think the same thing applies really. Let him know you are there, by physically being there, talk to him about mundane things, and allow him to grieve on his terms.",

I did the only things I could think of for her, sitting with her up until 3am sometimes if I had to before work at 7, feeding her, taking her for drives out to the woods to see the stars, getting her to show me pictures and tell me stories, making sure she got to church once she was more ready for people.

Let him be the verbal one. Now isn't the time to inject unnecessary words into a situation.\n\nPlace food and drink in front of him. I don't care if it's chips, crackers, chicken nuggets, or whatever. Set them down in front of him with a glass of water and make sure he at least hydrates. Nutrition and hydration can help keep someone from spiraling.\n\nHe needs your understanding right now. The best thing you can do is support him in whatever way he needs. He may need weeks to fully move past his current state, or he may come out of it soon. If you truly care for him, just be there and support his needs. It's not a permanent situation, but the grief will persist for a very long time, and you can be a beacon for him in the darkness.\n\nOnce he's past this initial phase, I would *highly* recommend grief counseling. You can probably even find local groups that do group sessions over Zoom. He's going to be having a lot of big feelings that he won't know how to handle.\n\nIt's possible he's going to go through a dark period for a while. He may act and think differently, because he's grieving and literally everything in the world gets harder when a dark cloud of oppressive grief follows you everywhere.\n\nIt's a bit of a cliche, but the only way out of grief is to get through it. If you don't face your grief, don't come to terms with what you've lost, and don't let yourself feel the feelings that come with loss, you'll drown in it.\n\nFor now, he needs support and caring. Later, he needs counseling and encouragement to face his fears and feelings. Even then, it's likely a loss like this will never really stop hurting, the pain just becomes manageable.\n\nOur feelings are like a big bucket. We can only fit so much into it without everything spilling over. Experiencing a loss is like adding a rock to that bucket. The rock goes in, the water level goes up, and the emotions threaten to spill over. The bigger the loss, the bigger the rock.\n\nYour boyfriend had a boulder dropped into his bucket, and right now his bucket can't hold anything else, so he shut down because his body can't handle all of the overflow. The thing is, the rock never goes away and it never gets smaller. Grief is how we grow the bucket.

            "My mother overdosed in my grandparents bathroom when I lived with them. I laid her out and started chest compressions and I felt her breathing stop, felt her heart beat stop, saw death on her face. It's terrifying seeing death that close in person. I was numb for nearly a week, it fucked me up so much I couldn't really function as a normal person. I was dating my now wife at the time and I still loved her deeply but there was just too much negative emotion to leave any room for a smile or compassion. It was nice seeing how much people were there for me, unfortunately I couldn't show my appreciation. I'd say just continue to be available but don't push the boundary. He'll come around after time has passed, I hope he can learn to live with that kind of experience because it's been 5 years since this happened to me and it still messes me up.",

            "Im not sure how \u201cin this\u201d you are but I have a little experience with this as my husband has intense grief and subsequent depression that will ebb and flow for the rest of our lives. Taking care of someone with this level of pain is a huge undertaking and is ultimately thankless. So maybe some of this will help or you can jump two feet in and do all of it if you\u2019re in this for life with him. \n\nIt\u2019s important to be around or to be available if you\u2019re not in the immediate vicinity. Offer physical comfort - a hug, hand holding, even just sitting next to him, that kind of thing - or to listen. Have SOOO MUCH patience and grace because he\u2019s probably going to be a dick at some or several points. Obviously I\u2019m talking more about a snappy attitude or a \u201cgo away\u201d and not abusive language but we all have our boundaries and you can decide yours for yourself. Don\u2019t grasp for the \u201cright thing to say\u201d, just say \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d, and don\u2019t say a thing about any \u201cbetter place\u201d or \u201cgod needed him\u201d. \n\nMake sure he\u2019s eating warming, nutritious foods - either you make it or order it or have cans of soup or frozen burritos around he can grab and quickly heat up. Get him a water bottle he can refill over and over and keep it filled and near him. Or get bottled water if that\u2019s just too much right now. \n\nRegular showers and teeth brushing are the only self care that\u2019s nonnegotiable and constant right now. It probably won\u2019t help him feel better but not doing it will definitely make him feel worse. \n\nTherapy. Lots of therapy. Group therapy, individual therapy. If you\u2019re in the US, there\u2019s free groups around that are usually in churches or through hospitals. My husband is the biggest therapy hater around and still benefitted from group sessions. \n\nHis doctor can get him medicine to sleep if he can\u2019t. Sleep is really important for processing trauma. Tetris is also a really good, easy escape that helps the brain process things. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss and I wish you good luck.",

Here are 4 options I have thought of\u2026\u201c\n\nOffer to stay, to leave, to call someone else he might want at this time and also ask if he has absolutely no idea. \n\nReassure him you won\u2019t be offended in the slightest if he wants you to leave him for some space because even in grief, sometimes people struggle to ask for what they need because they don\u2019t want to rock any boats or hurt someone\u2019s feelings if they know they might be upset. \n\nIf he does ask you to leave, it might hurt a bit but be sure to gently give him a hug, kiss, you\u2019ll call him later or tomorrow and you\u2019ll be right back over if he needs you. Have a wine with friends or run your emotions out! \n\nIf he doesn\u2019t know or there\u2019s still no response, you could find a balance of being in the house and checking in on him at meal times or for a hot drink a few times. Maybe go run some errands or see a friend for an hour or so, so you\u2019re also giving yourself some time to refresh if you need it. \n\nYou could get a journal for him and leave a pen with it next to him incase he gets to a point of wanting to get things out but still not ready to talk. \n\nAll the best to the both of you.

            "You need to get him to cry. Asap. \n\nMy dad got murdered earlier this year, and I got to cry about it whenever I felt like crying. Sobbed like a child every 5min for 2 weeks. \n\nDeath is normal, we just sometimes struggle to accept the inevitable. \n\nYour bf sounds catatonic though, which\u2026. Is not great. Getting him to respond might take a little while, but it needs to happen.",
            "Wait. Be there but let him talk or not.\n\nHe could be feeling guilty as he may have some relief that his dad's suffering is over, through to any and all emotions.\n\nThis will sound tough, but he may want to spend time with close relatives right now.\n\nJust be aware, it's not you he's upset with, and the fact you're concerned and wondering how to help will shine through.\n\nTough time for all, including you.\n\nTake care, stay strong.",
