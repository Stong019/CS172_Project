We like to brand and name our products different to any generic word like \"shampoo\".  This differentiate's it in customer's minds.\n2. Names are very important \"Herbal\" shampoo for example give's clients an idea how much better we are  and moves away from our competitors.  The branding and selling allows us to make a campaign specific to a new product and promote it to your minds.\n3. People using the \"wrong\" type allow for our increased sale volume, due to wastage.\n4. We want you to say I'm grabbing X in my mind not shampoo, we call this top of mind.  For example when we say chocolate, what is the product that you associate it with, Or soft drink,  you dont say cacao beans or fuzzy water do you.\n5. We specifically target the oils we strip in our shampoo so that the conditioner replenishes those oils with scents.\n6. You don't need conditioner if you use a soft or less powerful shampoo and just work it in longer, uneven application is the main reason that you feel it may not clean enough.\n\nI hope this helps\n\nPS: thanks for the award!",

        "selftext": "I mean, that\u2019s like 8 pints of milk in one go? 4.5 litres of milk? How does it even fit in the fridge? How can you use it all before it goes off? What on Earth are you guys doing with all that milk?\n\nEDIT: OK, so a US Gallon (3.7 litres) is only slightly bigger than a UK 6 pint bottle (3.4 litres), and not a 4.5 litre monstrosity. American milk also takes 2 weeks to go off, everyone has 5 children, a fridge the size of a Volkswagen, and drinks a pint of milk with every meal.\n\nEDIT2: Lots of people just read the title, and not the text (on reddit, who knew?). So this edit probably won't stem that tide, but I'm going to clarify the question, and what I have learned from the many answers. \n\nMy question was 'why do Americans buy milk in such a ridiculously impractical single unit as a gallon?' It's like someone saying 'oh, just grab me one of those 10 kilo salmon from the store on the way home?' and everyone just nodding like it's not completely insane for a grocery store to stock a single 10 kilo salmon, and for a person to then lug it home and consume the whole thing before it goes off. \n\nWhat prompted this question was watching The Taking of Pelham 123, where they make a really big deal of him coming home with a gallon of milk, and it made me think 'why on Earth would you buy milk by the gallon? Because here in the UK, which some people don't know is also populated by milk-drinking humans, the largest milk size is 6 pints, not 8 pints.' The reasons why this does in fact happen are twofold, and by asking a nostupidquestion, I have now been enlightened with them: \n\n1. The US pint is much smaller than the UK pint, so a US 8-pint gallon is actually 3.7 litres, not the 4.5 litres of a UK gallon. So the bottle itself is only a half pint (0.3l) larger than the largest size in the UK, not the whole extra litre of milk that I imagined. It seems the largest size commonly available is 4 litres in Canada, which is sold in a bag. Europeans point out that even the 3.4l / 6 pint bottle in the UK is an absurd size. They are also right, because there is nothing worse than wanting a splash of milk for a cup of tea, and realising you have to upend a full 3.4l ewer to pour out 0.005l of milk. I've never worked in an industrial foundry, but attempting this feat gives a man insight to the challenges of that profession. \n\nNone of this by itself explains why an individual would commonly buy milk by the gallon, until I learned:\n\n2. American milk is more thoroughly/aggressively pasteurised than UK milk, and has a usable life of several weeks. In the UK, milk from the store will have a shelf life of about a 7-10 days, and once the bottle is opened, it'll last about 4-5 days. So all of you who are commenting 'I live by myself and get through a gallon every week' are simply reiterating my point about why buying milk by the gallon seems so absurd. If you bought a 6 pint bottle of milk in the UK and opened it on Monday, by Sunday it's going to be absolutely minging (or 'gross') and completely undrinkable. That's why individuals buy smaller quantities of milk, but more regularly, even if they also consume a gallon of milk over a week. \n\nFinally, on behalf of the American dairy industry, may I thank all those commenters that single-handedly bear whole families of dairy farmers upon their calcium-rich shoulders. America salutes you. I myself can only wonder, do you piss, or just break off the stalactite that forms at the end of your knob? \n\nEither way, I came with a stupid question, and leave with that question answered. I also fucked up by enabling emails when people reply to posts, so I can also share that when people say 'RIP inbox' its just all the post replies arriving as email notifications, and not the poster receiving loads of messages that you can't see. Good day to you all.\n\nEDIT3: To be clear to those who didn't get this through implication, I'm well aware you can buy milk in smaller quantities than a gallon. If somebody asked 'why do you have $1,000 bills,' they're not asking because they think you pay for everything with $1,000 bills, they're wondering why such an evidently impractical thing would exist in the first place.",

Ours are the height of a full person and wider, averaging 17.5 cubic feet or half a cubic meter.  There were many silly things about the \"nuking the fridge\" scene in *Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull*, but the idea that a fully grown man could climb inside of one and close the door was not one of them.\n\nPersonally, I tend to buy *three* gallons at a time, preferring organic, UHT pasteurized milk from Costco that will last easily three months in the fridge if unopened.

            "Yeah, happens to me too (I'm in my late 30s).  I think it's partly because when you're a kid, and pretty much up till 21, people are asking your age all the time.  Or you're telling people your age all the time \"I'm 8 and a half years old, i'm so grown up, yay!\"  Once I was over 21, and especially since when I was 30, no one really asks and no one really cares.  I'm old enough to buy booze but not old enough to get AARP discounts on shit I buy, that's good enough for most people.",

If anything, it feels weird making smaller and usually wasteful purchases for things (which do add up in the long run) that I may regret. Regardless of how much it costs I\u2019m always seriously evaluating its value to me either while I\u2019m saving for it or as I\u2019m hesitating to click a purchase button.

            "I wasn't, but I do know a guy that was poor and also had many siblings, I think it's just over 10, not sure if it's 11 or 12 or what exactly.  He is single and has a great factory job now, so he's very stable.  He lives in a cute little house by himself. It's entirely unfurnished.  He has a single lazyboy chair and a TV.   I know he has a bed, beyond that he's got nothing.  He has BBQ's sometimes, and we bring camp chairs because there is nowhere to sit inside or out.  He also eats like a teenager.  I want to say he's late 50's, but he eats pizza rolls for every meal and he drinks Coke right out of a 2L bottle. \n\n It's weird as fuck, but I try to not judge him too much for any of this.  And before you ask, he is not obese, he loves walking.  He gets off work and walks until dark every evening.  Then when it comes to pizza rolls, I guess he just doesn't over eat.  He eats the exact right amount, and I'm sure he's got vitamin deficiencies, he has no health issues that I'm aware of.\n\nAs for his siblings it's a fucking slice of Americana.  A couple own businesses, a couple have good jobs, a couple have shitty jobs, a couple still live at home, a couple in jail.  I think astronaut is the only job someone in his family hasn't locked down.",

            "I was never really \"poor\" growing up, but I was raised cult-ish Christian and was always guilted for having worldly possessions and having things for pleasure in general. As a non-religious adult, it's helped me save money, but I always feel weird buying non-necessity things just for me.",
            "Yes. Specifically my husband, he grew up in a 3rd world country and is now a doctor in the states. He has every opportunity to treat himself to things but he feels terrible doing it. \n\nRemember that you deserve respect too - including from yourself. If you want new clothes or shoes you are allowed to do that for yourself :) It's easier to justify practical items, but treats or things that bring you happiness are okay too.",
            "Yes, it's super weird. I noticed a few years ago how often the phrase \"I can't justify buying that\" comes out of my mouth. I can buy things for other people without a second thought. I've spent tons of money on craft supplies for things I'm making as gifts for someone else. But buying something just because I want it always comes with a little edge of guilt.\n\nIt's also weird for me when other people want to buy things for me. One small example: My partner once bought me a beautiful blouse that I knew I couldn't afford and had tried on just to see what it looked like. I straight up cried because none of my past boyfriends had ever done such a spur-of-the-moment, frivolous thing for me.  It was pretty expensive, it was totally unnecessary, and he didn't have a lot of money at the time. He just did it because he thought I looked pretty and could see my mouth starting to form the words \"I can't justify buying this.\" It was a lovely, much appreciated gesture, but I somehow still feel a little guilty every time I see the blouse in my closet.",

Yeah, I might not need that cute plant, but it will make me smile every time I see it, and that smile is worth something.",
            "It does feel weird. Family was homeless for a couple years when I was a kid. Just bought a house earlier this year and still have a lot in savings, but I still don't like using heating/AC, go around the house making sure all lights are off in rooms people aren't in, and constantly have \"we have \\_\\_ at home\" & \"do you *REALLY* need it?\" in my mind when thinking about shopping. i convince myself i'm just being frugal or wise, and to a degree that's true, but i do convince myself a couple times a year to spend a little on myself because some of the habits learned in poverty aren't healthy & shouldnt be normalized.",
            "I spent some time on the streets, and the last few years I been trying to dig out. At one point I had 20,000$ in the bank. It was very strange, but what i noticed is that my time on the street made me not really care that much about the money, not like i did when i was younger. As long as i have enough to feed myself and pay for necessities, I really dont seem to care anymore about having enough to buy a lot of extras.\n\nI had to spend 12k out of pocket for medical procedures this year, and I didnt even blink writing the check. Before it would have really threw me for a loop, and I'm certainly still pissed that in the \"greatest nation on earth\" my insurance didnt help at all, but at the same time im not bothered that I dont have that money anymore. \n\nSorry if this was kinda rambly.",
            "It's a blessing dude. You appreciate little shit so much more. Like I'm in sort of an odd position in that I grew what you could call relatively wealthy until I was 12 and my mom, the sole bread winner, kind of had an existential crisis and decided to sell her business and move to Colorado. We were very poor for basically all of my high school years. She used to save money by using grocery store plastic bags as trash bags and buying one roll of paper towels for the year. These days I absolutely relish wasting paper towels and buying kitchen trash bags in bulk.",
            "I have a thing about baseboards.

            "I didn't grow up poor, but I grew up without things. I was raised to feel guilty to need clothes or nice things. Its stuck with me, and its difficult habit to get out of. Since I've had a proper job the past 2 months, I have money to actually afford things and treat myself.",
            "i have a problem of the opposite effect. now i can't resist buying things i don't really need but want because i can have them.

            "When I was growing up we didn't have internet except dial up at times, when DSL was a common thing, we didn't have TV except what came in from the antenna, we had \"running\" water but my chore was to drive down to the water station and haul back 250 gallons at a time (a blast when I was only 13 though), McDonalds or Pizza Hut was a once a month luxury at most, our house was barely holding itself together and we had no heat or air conditioning. I could go on and on, money was short and I grew up thinking this was how life was for everyone but the rich.\n\nFast forward to being 18 and moving across the country to a more populated area living with my uncle, I got a good paying job thanks to my mechanical capabilities and was making more money than I knew what to do with, ended up eventually chatting with a woman online and another fast forward a few months she suggests we go to Olive Garden her treat (probably knowing how I'd react already) and let me tell you going from everything I said above to an Olive Garden, seeing all the food, dressed up employees, prices on the menu, food I had never heard of, I was practically sweating at her \"breaking the bank\" to treat me to such a place, the bill ended up being almost $60 which was unheard of in my mind.\n\nIt's nine years later now and we're married, she still laughs at how I reacted that night. We're even better off than before (somewhere in the middle class range) and don't really consider Olive Garden when eating out since we don't see it as being too good. I've adapted a lot but I had a lot to get used to. I can set the thermostat to what is comfortable instead of what is cheap, go out to eat a couple times a week, bills get paid without killing my bank account. My parents just weren't about that kind of life.\n\nTo add though, I'm still a penny pincher. Store brand over name brand for most things, we try to cut back on eating out more recently more on a health standpoint but money-wise too, always making sure extra lights and appliances are turned off/unplugged when not needed, etc. It gives me a good middle ground of life I think.",
            "Yes, all the time. I don\u2019t even turn on lights because I forget they are available. I am constantly grateful for electricity, indoor bathrooms, running water and the like.

The availability of food and other products blows me away.",

Edit: I also enjoy throwing money at my kids and their hobbies, but they mostly like youtube and minecraft.",

            "I didn't grow up poor, actually pretty well off. But that was only because my parents were immigrants and worked so hard.

            "I definitely have this problem. Being poor as a child has definitely given me some long-lasting stress issues. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s like mild PTSD or what. Constantly feeling like I\u2019m the inferior one in the room, like my nice clothes look like I\u2019m playing pretend, etc. I was actually thinking about this the other day. I cried thinking how my son gets to live in a house we own and eat nice food and have new things that don\u2019t break after one use. He doesn\u2019t have to be constantly afraid of having to move, be hungry, feel poor and dirty. People won\u2019t make fun of him for dressing funny.

Like, every decision in your life is stressful.\n\nEverything so cheap it breaks if you look at it. Santa giving me dollar tree stuff while my cousin got a PlayStation. How do you explain that to a kid? Anything nice getting repoed. Macaroni and tuna two times a week. Sometimes we could get really fancy and dump in a can of peas. No fresh fruit or veggies. \n\nWear a worn out jacket over the stained donation shirts from the 80s. Maybe no one will notice. Water is out again? No bath for a couple days until the landlord comes to help. Oh and by the way I have no AC and it\u2019s 90 degrees in my bedroom at night. Can\u2019t sleep, I\u2019m too hot and worried. Dad has to get up for his 5AM job. If he\u2019s 5 minutes late to work, fired. He\u2019ll work until it\u2019s dark. Sometimes I see him on the weekends. \n\nMom and dad are yelling at people on the phone because they can\u2019t pay the bill and want an extension. Losing our apartments. Moving all the time. So sick, but mom can\u2019t pay to go to the doctor. No hair cuts, secondhand clothes, no dentist, my neighbors could practically hear me breathing through the crappy walls. My windows leaked in the winter. We didn\u2019t turn the heat on until we could basically see our breath indoors. No winter coat. No comforter. No curtains. Mom and dad sleeping all the time from migraines. My disabled sister had screaming night terrors a few times a week in our shared bedroom. Her medical debt sending us to bankruptcy twice. \n\nI felt like human dirt every day of my life. I refused to make friends because they had to be making fun of me. Plus, we\u2019d move in 6 months - what was the point? Not like I could invite them to my house - they\u2019d see how we lived. \n\nAnd sometimes I\u2019ll tell people I was poor as a kid and they\u2019ll tell me they were poor too. Except they\u2019ll tell me about their pool and boat and house and school trips and birthday parties... all the feelings come back again. \n\nI\u2019m so happy for my son. And I\u2019m so lucky. I still get giddy when I get to \u201csplurge\u201d on things like yogurt and spinach and mangoes and new pants and shoes that fit and air conditioning... It all feels like a dream.",

They lived off of my dad's commission and credit cards/401k loans. We moved around a lot because they rented and could never stay in the same place more than a few years.They never taught me to budget, and as a teen/early college I opened up credit cards and got myself into a ton of debt.\n\nWhen I was 20 my dad passed away, and when I was 22, my mom passed away. I was left with a 17 year old brother who hadn't yet graduated high school, no life insurance and a meager (\\~8k) 401k. Oh, and a shit ton of debt of my own, including $35k in school loans and no degree to show for it.\n\nJumped from job to job, drank a lot, continued to date the same guy I started dating at 18. When I was 25 and waiting tables, he bought a house and we decided to split the bills. Big mistake. I still sucked with money, and didn't pay my part of the bills. I had our power shut off. A few days later, he was served with papers from our HOA because I hadn't paid the association fees in 4 months. He almost lost his house because of me.\n\nObviously, he kicked me out. I had nowhere to go, no family around - ended up sleeping on a few friend's couches while I tried to get my shit together. Got my car repossessed; worked a shitty $10 an hour call center job and couldn't afford to feed myself. This was... 2010?\n\nMiraculously, my (very stable and responsible) boyfriend decided he wanted to take me back. I immediately started getting my shit together. I got a reasonable paying job in 2012 with no degree, which was surprising, and then turned around and got pregnant. We got engaged and I had our older son. We got married about a year after the kiddo was born. Kept my decent paying job and started slowly eliminating debt. Decided after 3 years to stay at home with the kid.\n\nFast forward to this year, we have since added another kid, and became completely debt free about 4 months ago. We paid off my car, our credit cards, his student loans, my student loans, the whole shebang. The only thing left is our mortgage. \n\nWe are currently bringing in $185k a year and I still buy all of our clothes at the thrift store and am terrified to touch any money for fear of losing it or fucking up again. Being poor can really fuck with your mindset permanently.\n\nThe biggest thing that I am enjoying now that we have room to breathe is being able to read a menu from a restaurant from left to right instead of right to left.",

Also I'm still living with my parents so I guess we have two more person earning income compared to when I was growing up (my mom didn't work when I was a kid). No idea how to spend all this money I'm now saving up. Took me a few years of having a job to get out of my 'I'm a poor student' mentality and realize I could actually buy stuff I wanted.",

When we got an apartment finally, we both lived in the living room for the first year we were housed. Took us a long time to be able to get out of the \"scraping by and keep it portable\" mindset. When you get used to living out of a duffel bag, buying a sofa seems ridiculously extravagant. I mean, a whole piece of furniture just for sitting? And each of us having a separate space of our own just for sleeping? Wow. It's taken us 3 years to get used to the idea that it's ok to have a thing or two.",

I feel very fortunate.",
            "Boy when I bought my car, I couldn't believe that \"I\" was gonna pull the trigger on it. \n\nI was toying around with the numbers so much, going back and forth so many times simply because I was scared to buy one. \n\nI felt like somebody would just come and say don't buy it. You can only dream about it. How can YOU afford such a nice car? Are you outta your damn mind? You are a peasant. You don't get to have nice things. You don't deserve it.\n\nNow when I think about those times, I smile.",
            "Yes. It's hard.  My husband and I went to a fantastic steakhouse in Vegas and enjoyed a $400 meal.  Best meal ever!   But the guilt afterward was awful.  All I could think about was that I spent in two hours what my mother brings home monthly from Social Security.  I live way below my means.  I live in a house that cost as much as my yearly salary.  I have a hard time splurging on things I don't need.  I bought my first new car at 45.  I have a hard time buying new furniture to the point my home is only somewhat better furnished and decorated than when I was a poor college student.  I am, however,  renovating my house now and planning to buy new furniture.  But it's HARD.\n\nEta:  my mother came from extreme poverty in Mexico and I spent a lot of time in Mexico with family.  I know what poverty is and so my perspective on spending money is certainly affected by this.",

I\u2019ll let it sit in the fridge until it spoils\n\nI have a hard time buying decorative things. All the walls in my house are bare.  \n\nStorage for important paperwork is in plastic bins.  I should really need to get a filing cabinet...\n\nEating out more than 1x weekly freaks me out and if I have leftovers already in the fridge I deal with some major guilt. \n\nBuying clothes is an issue as well. I realized that I only buy clothes for important events. All my casual clothes are crap and barely good enough to leave the house with. \n\nFunnily enough because we could only afford really crappy quality things growing up, I will only buy things of a certain quality because I want it to last forever. I scrutinize every detail and then leave it in the shopping cart for several months and keep talking to loved ones about how much I need to buy said item. \n\nI tend to be quite generous because I know how a little extra may help someone.",
            "I'm solidly middle class now and yet when I'm buying something I still do that quick calculation in my head of how many hours I'd have to work to earn the cost of the item. If it is not worth the hours, I don't buy it. I figure I could win the lotto and I'd still do it.",

Once I started making money (more than I actually needed) I've blown every paycheck for at least 3 years. Sounds bad to say but sometimes poor people are poor because they don't save and they don't save because they're always in survival mode, they feel the need to spend everything they earn because their thought process is that what they have now they may not have tomorrow, this is a cycle that is hard to break.",

            "Ok. I scrolled a bit and didn't see the real answer, so here it goes:\n\n\nIt totally depends on the type of restaurant, but a common answer is tip out. The percentage will vary, but I think normal is about 3%. That's what it was at the 5 restaurants I've worked at. Bus boys, bartenders, hostesses are all doing hard jobs but not directly getting tipped. Servers pay a \"tip out,\" or percentage of their total sales to the house which disperses it to those folks. So, if I have a $100 table, I owe the house $3 - regardless of what that table tips me. If I get a $5 tip, I have really only made $2. This also means that if a table doesn't tip, you can actually pay money to the restaurant to serve them. Unfortunately, the more entitled tables that don't tip are probably also the most needy. At most places I've worked, tip out is calculated automatically and you owe it regardless of what you're actually getting tipped.\n\n\n\nTipping culture sucks",

So if I take a table that is a 50 dollar check, and I get no tip, I actually lose a little over 5 dollars on that table. I pay to work essentially. Overall, the higher the bill the more we have to tip out, so tipping in proportion makes up for what we have to give up.\n\nEdit: People seem to think I like tipping out or I'm trying to justify it?? This is not the case.",

Or if they ordered a $80 plate versus our $500 plate.\n\nIt\u2019s strange how the system is set up. The tip structure encourages me to sell more expensive items which benefits the restaurant. Restaurants pay waiters minimum wage because we live off the tips.\n\nIt was a great living for a long while. I ended up moving onto IT and there are aspects of the restaurant I miss.

            "tipping is actually a scam established to justify low wages for employees. the myth that it is the polite thing to do is just fake peer pressure to keep the tip system going. people won't take a job for three dollars an hour unless you trick them into thinking that tips can be very worthwhile. so employers that refuse to pay a living wage just want to pass on their employees wages to the customers in reality. in many places they even add on the tips to bills automatically! if that wasn't enough bullshit many places also legally can take up to 20% of total employee tips... tipping is a scam and you shouldn't do it or it will perpetuate a bad system for predatory employers.",
            "Having talked with many friends who have worked tip-based jobs, there's a number of elements. \n\nFirst is yes, there is a difference in work. While the example given of a $20 vs a $60 steak might be a tad out of the norm, it stands to reason that you are paying for a different cut of meat, and that requires a different level of preparation. Not to mention the cost of remaking said dish or what have you if the dish turns out poorly the first go around. McDs can absorb the cost of a quarter pounder with cheese being redone a dozen times no problem. That Japanese Wagyu Beef burger on the other hand is not something they want to mess around with, so yes, more effort and careful work will go into it. \n\nSecond, the structure is based on the assumption you aren't eating out as people do in modern days, but in a more traditional period where eating out was rare, and where you only did it if you were with a larger group (family, friends, coworkers) and therefore buying a lot of stuff. Seating that many people, and then serving them all, would be a step beyond the \"norm\" of today where it could be just one or two people sitting for lunch. Therefore it was less about you and your $20 steak, but your friend's 2 steaks, your sibling's 3 sides, your coworker's 3 drinks, etc. \n\nThird is quality. Tipping is, or was, often seen as a recognition of the quality of the service rendered. Similar to point 1, a person ordering a $20 steak is less engaged with the staff, less likely to notice or care much about the details regarding the food, compared to the $60 steak customer. If quality of the steak was so important to them, they would've gone for the higher quality (and priced) steak instead. So, the staff will often give more attentive care to a higher paying guest because they definitely want that person coming back as often as possible buying $60 steaks. The $20 steak person, they want back, so will offer the basics of service, but they're not going as far above and beyond. \n\nThen you have the technical question of what kind of business and how the establishment is operated. A lot of places, the tips don't go to the server and cook who just happened to be lucky enough to have served that customer. These places operate under the idea that it was pure chance that \"you\" got the big spender, and it was enabled by the rest of the folks on staff at the time doing their jobs as well as they did that \"you\" had the opportunity to help that particular customer. Anyone else on the clock at the time could have and should have done the same level of work to earn the tip that was paid. So the tip gets spread out among everyone who was working while that customer was there. Well, if you start spreading out a tip among 5 people, a static $5 dollars doesn't get very far. Peg it to how much the customer spent instead, now you can start earning a little bit bigger returns.",
            "American tipping culture is beyond warped.  They don't set the standards for it, they just chose to make it this way, hence why the rest of the world thinks it's absolutely unjustified and crazy.",
            "Tipping all around doesn\u2019t make sense. \n\nRestaurants be like: \u201cAh yeah this item is 20$ & whatever else you want to give me. Btw if you don\u2019t give me at least 24$ I\u2019m going to drag my balls across your steak next time you come\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cSo just mark the price as 24$ please\u201d\n\nBut yeah it\u2019s deeply ingrained in American culture so it\u2019s not going anywhere. Just do what you can to prevent it from spreading to other countries",
            "Because tipping is stupid and should go 100% away in all contexts. When we reached the point of tip jars at self-serve shops there was no denying we'd completely lost the plot. Pay workers for doing a job. Charge what you need to cover the pay. Customers pay what is charged. That is how business works. Tipping turns work into panhandling and no one benefits but the business owners who can pretend it's not their fault if people don't make enough money at their JOBS to live on.",
            "It\u2019s commission really . If you were at the restaurant awhile ordering a lot of stuff, or at a better restaurant ordering a $100 a plate dinner; yes there\u2019s more sales work . If you go to a lower end place like McDonald\u2019s, don\u2019t tip obviously. As they merely took your order and you get your napkins yourself.",
            "In Washington State servers are paid minimum wage ($14.49) by the restaurant AND still expect a 20% tip from the customer. There's winners and losers in any line of business.  But we never eat out.\n\n I think the real problem is all of us with student debt and pointless degrees can't afford to eat out because our \"white collar\" jobs don't pay enough. In many cases, we work long hours and weekends barely making more than minimum wage on an hourly basis because we are not entitled to overtime and are paid on a salary basis. We are told social justice exists because the people at the bottom are treated better than they have in the past while in reality the average person's situation only continues to deteriorate.",

            "Just so we\u2019re clear. Restaurants that don\u2019t do tipping charge more for menu items to cover the cost of paying their employees. You still tip it\u2019s just not distributed the same way. The reason I don\u2019t think this model could work in America is because Americans shop convenience and deals. You can\u2019t both get the 6 dollar pizza from Domino\u2019s and also expect they\u2019re paying their employees a living wage from it.",
            "I don\u2019t tip unless it\u2019s socially unambiguous that I\u2019m required to do so. It\u2019s dumb. I\u2019d only feel obliged when I know the worker gets paid 2.13/hr",

            "[deleted]",
            "It shouldn\u2019t be- the real issue is the people who expect tips are not educated enough to understand percent versus flat rate for service. When prices have increased, they expect the percentage should also increase- that is why a good tip has climbed from 10% to 15% to 18% and now most electronic forms use 20%,22% or 25%. It is crazy and moreover it will result in pushback.\n\nAnother example is that servers have complained about a 20% tip that I left as I used the net amount and not total amount with the  service charges and taxes as part of the base amount. \n\nMore specifically to the point of the steak- some people order a 50$ bottle of wine with their steak dinner and others may order a $1000 bottle of wine. Should the tip include for the wine as well? Most experts would say you should only tip when a sommelier helped select the wine otherwise a flat rate is more appropriate.",
            "When I was a server we had to tip out other staff members ie\u2026 bartenders, bussers, hostess, 1% each of our gross sales. So regardless of what I made in tips if i sold $1000 worth of food and beverages I would have to tip out $30 to the above mentioned positions. If I only made $40 that night because I got stiffed by a large party or whatnot then I would go home with $10 after busting my butt all night, all the while only earning $2.13 and hour.(Based on true story). And yes that is actually illegal because tips plus hourly wage are supposed to equal at least minimum wage per hour but I have never experienced an restaurant owner willing to do that. Also, I fully agree that tipping sucks in the U.S. and it should be changed but in the meantime, remember that servers are just people trying to earn a living."

Out of curiosity I translated it and it was a girl saying \u201chello, your cat is beautiful\u201d. \n\nI said thank you (using translator) and then she sent me a picture of her neighbours cat. I thought it was very cute but it was obvious this was a very young girl. I felt a bit weird about it but I did talk to her for short while. I then asked some friends what the fuck I should do because this is really weird to me. I don\u2019t want to offend her by blocking her, and I don\u2019t want to start this friendship with a young Ukrainian girl lol. They said just ignore or block. So I\u2019ve been ignoring her.

I don\u2019t know why I clicked it but I did....\n\nIt was just her in her room dancing to some music. This girl is very young. She was fully clothed of course but I had no fucking idea how to process what was going on. I was the only viewer. \n\nI closed the app after about 15 second and was so creeped out.

Someone that young needs a bit of supervision on the internet right? I\u2019ve been trying to think of a way to draw her parents attention to it. I\u2019m sure they\u2019d be concerned.

You should be careful because there are some dangerous people out there\u201d in Ukrainian of course. \n\nShe sent back a message but she deleted before I could read it.

I was abused significantly as a child, and that led to my repeatedly seeking inappropriate relationships with much older men at an age where that kind of scenario should have been the farthest thing from my mind.\n\nYou might be the person to set in motion a life changing series of events that could save this girl from further abuse at the minimum and potentially being human trafficked if another male with that agenda were to get ahold of this child.

            "**FOR THE GUY THAT DELETED HIS COMMENT BEFORE I COULD POST MY ANSWER:**\n\n(It was about the different age of consents; still posting this because I feel like it's extremely important to educate people on this and why it's **not ok** to sleep with minors even if they \"consent\")\n\nWell there's this issue - when you are so young you are really not technically an adult no matter what and however developed you may seem. The fact is that you are truly not, you ARE still a kid. And yes, the under aged party might  consent at first but what happens if that person figures out that they changed their mind? Or what if it seems like a bad decision afterwards? The thing is that very young person don't often realize all consequences and are not in a position to process stuff as an adult would. Kids should never be put in such situations, trust me. I lost my virginity at very young age (I was 13) and I was also seemingly very developed, much more than my peers. So yeah, I know exactly what I'm talking about.\n\nAlso, in some countries age of consent is 9! But in developed societies the census is to set the age consent to much higher age when, generally speaking, the person is lot more mature and prepared to process all of the stuff and think through all of the possible consequences as well. The thing, that age of consent in some countries is much higher speaks more about how conservative the given society is. South Korea particularly has long tradition of Confucianism and is generally very closed to matters concerning public display of affection etc. so the age of consent is thus higher than in most countries.\n\nEDIT: Grammar, phrasing",

Crows will also scratch cars, if someone cuts you off don't be surprised to hear screeching sounds as they drag their claws into the paint of the parked car.\n\nYour crow friends will be around for life. You will see crows everywhere and they will become a natural part of life. **All crows are the crow you helped.**\n\nAs for what you do?\n\nAlways accept the crows gifts, even when you have no idea what to do with them. They bring or steal them with pride. Some crows will watch you until you take the gifts inside, clearly waiting to report how you reacted.\n\nAnd *be glad the crows don't hate you, because that would be a murder.* The people the crows don't like will get scratched. Crows will fly down, scratch someone and fly away, I've seen it a few times.\n\nCrows will never forget you for better or worse.

            "Be sure to do something with them. Crows are paying you for being kind to them. They remember and reward those who are kind to them as well as remembering those who are unkind to them. You are being honored as part of their group (murder of crows). Very lucky indeed.",

            "Crows are neat birds but must be respected and not taken advantage of. Once I fed a few a banana during a bad winter and one left me a moonstone marble. It was pretty cool actually. Kind of freaked me out. Mad respect for those weird intelligent dinosaurs. But they do hold grudges and can remember faces- so be careful not to piss any off. Lol.",

            "I had a pet crow for about 3 months and oh my gosh are they adorable. They are also a pain in the ass and live for more than 10 years. If you feed him, he will expect food from you and peck at your window and caw until you give him some. They are super smart. I gave my baby crow an apple and he stuck it in between the deck boards. He then proceeded to get offended becuase he couldn't remove it. If you have a garden, he will eat your flowers. If you have other pets, he will become extremely possessive of you. I would say, (and I know you will read this on every other website, but you won't want to believe them,) don't feed it. They are generally just a pain. Visualise this. You get guests over, and the crow is stoked and lands on one of the guests shoulders. He has a heart attack and dies.\n\n\nTldr Crows are fun and a goshdang pain in the ass.",
            "Fed one for years, just keep feeding him if you enjoy it, put things you want next to the food/where it puts the sticks, it may pick up on what you want, over the years I got maybe 5-10lbs of white quarts/gravel.\n\nFYI training them to steal money/jewelry is illegal lol\n\nI started feeding them because they were destroying my trash bags on garbage day, after I started feeding them that stopped, it was all scraps that would have went in the trash anyways.",
            "Crows like shiny objects. But beware, they are very intelligent creatures. You are befriending him, and he is, in his mind, befriending you. You have a unique relationship. Enjoy it while you can.\n\nEdit: chocolates that come in foil cups or wrappers, Shiney screw off caps, etc. Just put them out there with the food and treats. If he takes one, he likes it.",

            "My mom tells a story of how my uncle raised a fledgling crow and taught it swear words. The crow would perch on his handlebars and say salty phrases at the neighbors as he rode through town. My uncle was a very soft spoken adult and he would just giggle whenever my mom told this story.",
