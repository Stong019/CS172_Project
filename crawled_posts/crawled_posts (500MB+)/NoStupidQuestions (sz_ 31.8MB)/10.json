I'd say that the one-way aisles are 'small beans' but at least with masks you can just ask them.",
            "Well, if you confront them, depending on where you live, the risk of getting into a heated argument is high. This could lead to higher risk of infection so best to keep to yourself and let some other idiot confron the idiots. In short, don't be an idiot. :)",

Why is no one doing anything? Why is there never a cop (appropriate authority figure) when you need them. \nIf you then decide to turn into \u201cPeople Police\u201d since no one else is doing it, you will be more stressed, more likely to get into arguments, more likely to get in a physical confrontation and more likely to road rage. \n\nNone of it is worth it. As a European living in the US I can completely understand your view point but I have been here long enough to understand the cultural differences too.

Leave people alone and get your shit done and get out. Sanitize things you touch and be mindful of people you are close to. Simple as that. Doesn\u2019t need to be a day ruining situation when times are already anxiety inducing enough. Why make your mental state worse by confronting and yelling your opinion at them.

I personally have very bad anxiety, especially in stores, and wearing a mask makes it slightly harder for me to breathe and causes panic attacks more frequently. I\u2019ve personally been using instacart to avoid the store all together, but some people may not be financially able to do so and still have conditions that prevent them from wearing masks.",

If someone was coming, I would be able to see them coming UP the aisle and move in time to be kind and courteous.   \n\n\nWell, one morning I got a few people who were just standing there trying to go the wrong way down as I stocked, one loudly saying, \"Excuse me\". I had the same inner dialogue of \"Do I say something? Do I tell them they are going the wrong way?\", but just moved my cart without saying anything, then stared at them and the arrow as they walked on..  \n\n\nYou gotta wonder \"Are people being stupid, lazy or defiant?\"",

You can tell they DGAF about anybody and they're just putting in the most empty weakest measures they can to try to keep the health department off their back.\n\nI really hope this whole thing eventually leads to a wildcat strike when the time is right.",

A good 30% of mask wearers I\u2019ve seen in public only have their mouth covered, not their nose. It\u2019s frustrating, but I haven\u2019t the jellies to tell them. Fcking social anxiety.",
            "The more I read these comments and compare them to what I've seen in Walmart/Lowe's, I think it comes down to a combination of two factors. \n\nFor one, the don't-give-a-shit factor being very high. Or maybe it's more of a you-can't-tell-me-what-to-do. I don't know why we are so against following any type of new rule or guideline. Certainly there is some amount of perceived risk versus perceived reward. As in, \"if I just speed through the store and don't wait for aisles to clear, it's not like I'M going to get the Covid and I'm in a rush!\"\n\nBut really, I think a lot of people are just completely oblivious to the changes in policy, despite the signs everywhere and announcements over the PA. Seriously, tons of the comments are pointing that out. My coworkers have said the same. People don't pay attention to the world around them.",
            "I get anxious just by being in a store. I feel like I can\u2019t look at anyone and have to finish my shopping in five minutes. A bagger at the grocery store became unreasonably upset when I was probably 5 1/2 feet away from her. As for the one-way aisles, how effective are they, really? You can still get close to someone else going the same direction.",

They cut people off in traffic, litter, reply all on emails, don't pick up their dog poop. \n\nThink of it like those things. You can confront people who do all those things too, but it probably won't change their behavior. The behavior is rooted in something larger than not realizing they are not following the rules. It's either an apathy towards the rules or ego that believes that rules don't apply to them. \n\nThis doesn't change in a crisis. \n\nSo pick and choose your battles. You'll never civilize the world, and you'll go crazy trying. Also keep in mind that social distancing has overall been working even with the percentage of people do not obey rules.",

Our head office tells us to encourage the rules but don't enforce unless someone is overtly flouting the social distancing policies. But we don't kick people out for not following the route, or getting too close unless they become abusive. Even the staff are told not to follow the arrows as it would take too long to do the job.

If you see someone going the wrong way, tattle telling isn't going to do anything.\n\nI haven't worn masks or gloves when grocery shopping. I might consider it if I get hassled enough about it, but I know how to wash my hands and I know how to not cough, sneeze, breathe on other people. I walk briskly past them at the grocery stores.\n\nAlso, I shop when the stores open. It's not nearly as crowded.\n\nAnxious people should consider online shopping or curbside pickup.\n\nAt what point is this all going to end? Even if leaders declare it over, people will still be anxious every time they see someone without a mask or not following the arrows.\n\nWe can't live in fear forever. Yeah, I'm staying at home and only going out for groceries. But I already feel like that's enough and in fact, going above and beyond. The rest is just security theater.",

            "Going the wrong way down a one-way aisle and taking masks off is frustrating. But what's truly infuriating is when someone brings their entire family to the store and then blocks off one of the most heavily trafficked areas of the store while they argue over what to buy.",
            "I picked up work at a supermarket in the UK after my university was shut down. Moving back home I went from a fairly big, city area to the rural south-west region.   \n\n\nI work mainly as a marshal, trying to remind people to follow measures taken to social distance. Arrows are around the store to stop face-to-face interaction and there is one big queue to stop people randomly going to tills and causing traffic. It's a long process yes, but if people only came for essential shopping and followed the system it would be much quicker.   \n\n\nI'd say about 40% of shoppers actually follow the arrows, even after reminding some shoppers they still would ignore the arrows and wander down isles to cross people. I feel helpless because after telling people to go around and follow the arrows, when they think my backs gone they are ignoring me.   \n\n\nAnd the big queuing system has people up in arms about waiting 20 minutes to pay. It's difficult to tell them that a global pandemic is more important than you waiting to buy non-essential items and they won't have it.   \n\n\nBut then a customer calls another customer out, and everything just goes to shit. We had a fight in store a few days ago between two men. One called the other out for ignoring the arrows and they basically had a fist-fight in store.   \n\n\nNot sure how this answers the question or really contributes but I just need to rant tbh. The public are so entitled where I live and just assume that this won't affect them because they're...? Somehow immune? Trying to reason is out of the question so I just don't talk. If they complain, I tell them to go to another store next time.",
            "Oh, absolutely! Huge anxiety spike from shopping, even though I do it only once every 5 days (I shop for 3 though).\n\nBut I don't judge them too harshly on the one-direction isle thing. Both of the supermarkets that I go to did an absolute shit job of it. One has no markings whatsoever, you're supposed to go with the flow, I guess? And the other is confusing as fuck, and not a single path leads to the meat section, there's just no arrows there. If you follow the arrows verbatim, you'll just be stuck in the corner of the store, having bypassed multiple sections entirely. The last isle literally says \"Turn left\", but there's a wall on the left, you have to turn right if you want to reach the registers and get out.\n\nIt does piss me off when people are walking around coughing without a mask. Like...dude...you're already symptomatic, stay the fuck home! But if you absolutely must grace us with your radiant presence, at least put a mask on! And these fuckers like to pass WAY closer than the social distancing. I'm standing at a crosswalk, nobody around to either side, sun in shining, and suddely there's this loud hacking cough straight behind me. Some white trash woman just walked past me, maybe not every 30cm away and cut across the intersection just as the lights were changing. Too self-important and in too much of a rush to veer around a little bit. Or maybe intentionally spreading it, it's hard to tell with the general amount of lunacy these days.\n\nA couple of weeks back there was another asshole. On a bike. On the sidewalk, which is already against the rules. And he's riding, no mask no nothing, coughing periodically. By the time you hear the cough, it's too late to move because he's moving at a decent speed. Great, just lovely, thank you!\n\nAnd last week or so the quarantine fatigue is kicking in, and weather is finally starting to warm up a little, and there's tons of people on the street and in stores, just...browsing. Meanwhile I'm moving cover-to-cover as fast as I can, grabbing what I can and moving on. We're all breathing the same shit in those stores anyway, but I figure the quicker I leave the better. Totally anxious by the time I get home.\n\nAlso pretty much nobody is wearing masks or gloves. One supermarket issues gloves on entry, but the other doesn't. Neither one has cashiers wear masks, just the door guards do. It's actually kinda wild, seeing other countries making it mandatory, and we're over here totally cavalier about it. But I guess population density is in our favour? Maybe.",

People that don't have any respiratory problems, any other serious conditions, and don't regularly or because of the stay at home order come into contact with elderly people should just get it over with. For the vast majority of people, it isn't that bad. If the whole country didn't instantly panic and grind to a stop than a lot more people would have gotten it right away and got over it. All of those people would now be acting as \"fire breaks\" to stop the infection. Instead we are going to drag this out until our country enters a serious depression and kids start starving to death. If you had to choose someone to die, would you pick a child that would be healthy with food or an 80 year old that has multiple chronic conditions, some of them physically and/or emotionally painful, including depression because their soulmate and friends have already died and they don't say it, but they feel like a burden on their family?

Rock wasn't anywhere on stage when Smith received his award. Then, of course, Smith gives his impromptu speech when he won the Oscar.\n\nRegardless if the incident was staged or not, it has created a polarity in conversation regarding the Oscars given situations like this has happened before. Anything can happen when airing a live performance.\n\nMost likely what will happen after this fallout is the committee will deem any jokes against any person are no longer allowed, and there will be an increased security to prevent anyone from just walking on stage.\n\nThe Oscars have been a joke for decades, but for some reason, people keep tuning in, like any of it truly matters.\n\nIf this action doesn't turn people off to this ridiculously phony ceremony, this says more about the audience than it does an upset comedian.",

Chris Rock was obviously not hurt aside from maybe his pride, and Will walked away right after he got his hit in. Now had he stayed up there and went for more hits, or gone up there and straight decked Chris in the face, broke his nose or gave him a bloody lip thatd be a different story. Same thing with a punch to the gut or anything else essentially would have had an entirely different reaction and the whole show probably would have stopped right there at least for a while. \n\nWas it crazy and could have been handled better?

If tobacco does in fact meet all of the criteria you laid out, but harms no one except the user, should the govt of a free country outlaw it?

He kind of dreamed at working for NASA, but settled running the entire server system and being the sole IT person for a plastic mold company that relies heavily on computers for the artists to make molds. He worked there I wanna say 20 years. He was let go during the 09 recession to have his work shifted to independent IT consulting, tbh I dont entirely blame them because he had alcoholism issues and diabetes, he was already walking on canes and had a few hospitalizations. The worse was yet to come, he threw himself into alcohol and lost his legs, developed alzheimers mixed w alcohol related brain function issues. This happened when I was 9.\n\nThis backstory is relevant, because even tho he was a tech genius and constantly building PCs for his friends, working on laptops, kept teaching himself, he didnt teach me anything but had hopes of building a color organ with me. That kit is still in the basement, 10 years later.\n\nI am now the designated computer geek for my family. I built my PC, I do soft coding for minecraft and friend level minecraft servers, I can do basic troubleshooting and diagnostics. I taught myself damn near everything. I researched, I befriended dev's who taught me, I spent countless days working to better my tech savviness, which tbh isnt a whole lot but meets my gaming requirements.\n\nMy dad loves to say how HE taught me all that I know. He keeps going on and on about how well I know java and how he helped me with it, how I assembled my PC solely with him holding my hand thru the process, etc. It drives me nuts. Hes called me frantic before because some of the junk on his desk flipped his PSU switch and he couldnt figure out why his computer wasnt booting. I helped fix my mum's tower, his liquid cooling tower, his 2 side project towers for his friends, and he either takes the credit or takes credit for me learning from him.",

I still have the camera, cs6, and all that, but the pressure to \"make something of it\" ruins it for me and adds too much anxiety, when it started as me taking long walks for my anxiety and to get away from my family and stresses to a burden for me\n\nI know this is kinda unrelated, but man does she like to try to make EVERYTHING a business (but only for me, she's allowed to have hobbies that aren't jobs)",

            "America is a very individualistic society, and it's largely built on the idea that an individual's success is solely based on their effort.",
            "So what's interesting is that Americans overall tend to be very generous (statistically across the board vs other countries) in terms of donating money to causes or people.\n\n1. But a lot of people have an issue with the government taking more of your money to \"do ___\".\n\nFor one a lot of people don't trust that the government is actually going to do what they say they're going to do. Anytime a bill comes up that proposes increased taxes there's always debates that allege that the money is actually not going to go towards what it says it's going to.\n\nIe - there was a recent bill in my state that was designed to raise taxes with the extra money going to the schools but the argument against it was that the increased taxes would just go to the already overpaid School administrators and not actually go to the classrooms.\n\n2. Also America is the society that has individualism ingrained in it, but again Americans are generous so that doesn't tell the whole story.\n\n3. Especially when it comes to government programs, a lot of people may feel that those types of programs are going to wind up being exploited by people who don't truly need it and are just going to mooch off of the system. And they don't want their money going towards that. They would rather to donate their money somewhere where they perceive that it's actually going to be useful.\n\nThat or they feel that the people who are going to benefit shouldn't be benefiting from it. For example people who feel that illegal immigrants should not be entitled to free healthcare.\n\n-------\n\nOverall, I don't find that the majority of people or a large majority of people don't want programs like State health Care in place, or money allocated to the schools etc. With more people it boils down to concerns about who's making the decision about how that money is distributed and how that money is actually going to be distributed and if they feel like that is antithetical to their political or worldview",
            "I think most Americans with this sentiment probably feel that they already give a ton of $$$ to the government to take care of those things and that most of the money is mismanaged and wasted. So they don't feel like they need to give more.",

            "Canadian here, married an American and \"lived there\" as a visitor for a year.\n\nEveryone is struggling against forces always trying to take more from you in the states. Your employer, your city, your state - they all want to give you less and cost you more all of the time. And their services SUCK. It really sucks. The only places that have the best of anything are running on corporate money. And those corporations are always fucking around taking more than their share too.\n\nSo people at the lower levels of this pyramid scheme that is the American economy feel entitled to take. Or to do things differently even, to have the means to live. This can really ruffle the feathers of those trying to maintain a standard of living they previously enjoyed with less effort.\n\nSo instead of directing their rage at all these faceless systemic problems they direct their disdain at each other.\n\nTL;DR: classism",

            "One thing I haven\u2019t seen talked about is that the most individualistic tend to be the people most dissatisfied with their lot in life. They don\u2019t want someone else to get out of the grind easier than them and the people who have worked their whole lives don\u2019t understand how people could really be unable to find a job because that has never happened to them, so instead they assume the person is lazy and dishonest and therefore not worthy of help. The perception is probably related to what another commenter said about our society being based on the idea that anyone can do anything jf they work hard enough (even though that is demonstrably not how things actually work).\n\nAlso, news will cover abuses of systems, but generally not them working as intended. Maybe we need more heartwarming stories about people that just needed a safety net and then went back to work. Or people who are profoundly disabled and not supported by family and we know they need society to care about them.",

            "It's because we're spoonfed what's called the \"American Dream\" as kids, to the point where we're specifically taught to believe that the ultimate dream of an American is to be moderately wealthy and successful, surrounded by a nuclear family.  And to achieve this you just work hard.  That's it.  \"If you work hard all your dreams will come true\" is the most American opinion you could have.\n\nWhen we get older this starts to be challenged by two things:\n\n1) Rich people.  We rationalize them as people who have achieved the American Dream.  Good for them.  Keep working hard.\n\n2) Poor people.  We rationalize them as people who aren't working hard and therefore have not achieved, and will likely never achieve, the American Dream.\n\nSo we have upper, middle, and lower classes, and everything seems fine as long as we don't think about it too much.  And keep working.  It's a holdover from 1950s thinking, where we rode this magnificent economical wave of wealth for a whole generation, and came up with this philosophy.  It's mostly a conservative philosophy, because American conservatism is the philosophy of keeping everything the same.  Never change anything, keep everything as-is.\n\nThis starts to be incongruent with the real world when you realize that the children of the 1950s, the American baby boomers, were only children when they experienced this spoiled, fattened calf of a time period, and they don't realize that it was born of imperialism, espionage, political sabotage, and incredibly high taxes.\n\nSo with this mindset you can understand how socialism, which they understand as the government wanting to redistribute wealth among people, has become a meaningless, vile word.  You can understand how any conversation of taxes or foreign aid is met with disgust.  And you can see how they are hesitant to help others.  There are an alarmingly high number of people here that truly believe that wealth and success just comes if you work hard, without so much as a critical thought such as, \"but wait, aren't things like factory workers necessary in the world and does that mean they just should settle for having not achieved the American Dream?\"",

            "   A lot of the rhetoric people are citing here was borne out of the conservative response to the new deal. Business interests have been consciously engaging in a legislative and propaganda campaign since the 40's to halt the expansion of a welfare state and dismantle what programs were put in place under FDR and the warren court. In the late 19th/early 20th century, the formalized the process for establishing tax free charitable foundations, with little oversight as to what type of work constituted charity. The nations wealthiest individuals took advantage of this system, in many cases to perform truly beneficial work, but at the same time, to establish doctrinal think tanks which would formalize and disseminate their personal outlooks and ideas through tightly controlled research, publications, and by funding university departments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Popular opinion almost uniformly supported the new deal reforms, as the benefits of said programs were self evident to the working and middle class, as they achieved a high standard of living and level of social mobility in the post war period. However, with the advent of desegregation, you saw the conservative and new libertarian talking points, which had changed little since before WW2 newly couched by the aforementioned think tanks as a conflict not between the investment class and working people, but between working and middle class whites and their black counterparts. This had been avoided previously through (not entirely reluctant) concessions by the Roosevelt admin to white union leadership and southern democrats to exclude blacks from most of not all of the new deal programs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Conservatives were able to tie new deal programs, and burgeoning great society programs, to desegregation and civil rights in the minds of white americans. The idea being that the federal government was not pooling communal resources for the benefit of all, but that it was taking from the white community to fund handouts to undeserving and ungrateful blacks. The face of this narrative was everywhere in the last half of the 20th century, in bussing and the welfare queen myth. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Since then, these arguments have become entrenched in the American psyche and for many people, completely alienated from their racist origin, through conscious abstraction by movement conservative leaders and think tanks, and through the funding of libertarian-minded foundations, who have again re contextualized the issue as purely economic. The view that these attitudes have always been prevalent in the American psyche is largely ahistoric, which becomes obvious when you examine the primary sources during the foundation of the country to the voting patterns up until the postwar period. It's only once race becomes intrinsic to the notion of federal spending that we see uniform opposition thereto nationwide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   This is not to say that the contemporary debate is comprised of racist, anti-social spending arguments vs altruistic, non-racist arguments for social spending, but that the origins and prevalence of this attitude is best understood through robust histiography, rather than pointing to some unique, intrinsic personality trait shared by all Americans. Ideas become popular for a reason, and those reasons can and should be studied.",

            "All the comments seem to be pointing to the individualist elements of American culture, but I think the discussion is missing the ways that our political and economic systems reinforce this mentality.\n\nOur entire economy is structured around the idea that we're all individuals responsible only for ourselves - while other countries have strong collectivist institutions like social housing and universal healthcare, the American obsession with freedom and individualism means that we tend to structure nearly all elements of our lives according to market logic. Ergo, you have to buy your own insurance, you have to secure your own housing, you have to negotiate your own salary, you have to have your own car instead of investing collectively in public transit, etc. But this isn't exactly a culture thing, these are deliberate policy decisions, and they're enacted because they benefit rich people. \n\nWhen you live under these circumstances, they condition you to think about the world in those terms - we each have to pay our own way, no one ever looks out for me in the market, everyone is always trying to get one over on me. So many people assume that any money that's not getting spent directly on you, by you, is in some way cheating you. And that's understandable, because that's how most of the rest of our lives work. Basically, I think introducing the logic of the market into almost every element of our social lives (and make no mistake, this is what politicians are talking about when they promote privatizing services) has fundamentally eroded a meaningful sense of collective benefit, community, or public good - both in terms of the American mindset and in terms of the rules and policies that govern our country.\n\nThe real interesting question, imo, is which came first: these individualist attitudes, or the systems of political economy that reinforce them.

The second you tell Americans they have to pay, they don't have a choice, and everyone will benefit (not just people they like or feel sorry for), they want no part of it. \n\nOh, and the fact that insurance companies paid people to lie for years about how bad socialized medicine is really didn't help either. \nhttps://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-monday-edition-1.5631285/this-former-u-s-health-insurance-exec-says-he-lied-to-americans-about-canadian-health-care-1.5631874",

            "There\u2019s been a campaign against socialism going on for the past 100 years in this country. The propaganda of big business has instilled its message in such a manner that Americans equate freedom and democracy with capitalism, and the wage laborers all believe that they are capitalists themselves. A lot of Americans think the Chamber of Commerce is a department of the government.\n\nIt also has a lot to do with the fact that the USA is isolated geographically and that makes us feel alienated and not a part of a larger world, so we\u2019re pretty ignorant about how government and economy and society functions everywhere else.\n\nEdit: Some of the top answers are riddled with misconceptions engendered by business propaganda. 95% of poverty relief in this country is through government run programs, but there\u2019s a whole bunch of redditors who think Americans are awesome philanthropists and it\u2019s private charity that keeps this place from going full Mad Max. \u201cGovernment is bad and wasteful\u201d is also another well-worn concept in the propaganda we\u2019re exposed to. Years and years of exposure to that message is a big part of the reason why the Capitol riot occurred. \n\nSuper depressing to read a lot of those upvoted comments.",
            "The American capitalist system encouraged/encourages individualism. The \u201cpull yourself up by your bootstraps\u201d ideal and the Titans of our industrial revolution pushed the idea that your success was determined by how hard you worked, and if you didn\u2019t succeed it\u2019s because you didn\u2019t work hard enough. So no handouts, no help.",
            "Gonna get buried, but I feel strongly about this topic.\n\nThere are lots of reasons - many of the more prominent ones being very misguided and (unfortunately) propogated - but other people have already mentioned the ones that I've encountered most: abused and broken systems, individualism/selfishness, and not caring for other people (whether it be due to not knowing or disliking them).\n\nInsurance companies have a strong presence in the US becuase they've spent decades building a middleman empire that can now afford TONS of lobbyists to prevent laws that are unfriendly to them from being passed. Privatized R&D in healthcare has led to a massive, ever-evolving ecosystem of biotech and drug companies which not only have enough money to sidestep or outright ignore penalties from regulators (i.e. the FDA - it's easier for the companies to pay a drop-in-the-bucket-sized fine than to harm profits by not developing new products, much like the way our banks can afford to skirt financial regulations with abandon), but also develop medicines faster than regulators can hope to keep up with. Few tax dollars=few government staff=not enough employees to review companies' works. Education expenses lead to sky high student loan debts for healthcare professionals, and a lack of federal tax dollars from a universal healthcare system that pays those professionals guranteed rates to supply them with the income needed to repay such massive debts makes it more lucrative for those professionals to sign contracts with insurance, biotech, and drug companies; those contracts require promotions of expensive or unnecessary products and services (i.e. name brand or 1st gen drug prescriptions, unnecessary consultations, non-requested procedures - not to mention outright kickbacks) that do pay well, albeit at the literal and figurative expenses of both their patients and our overall healthcare system.\nThese are the broken and abused systems which caused a friend of mine to accumulate $10K in medical debt (another $50K was waived due to \"financial hardship\") by the age of 19: they needed heart surgery and an implant, but had neither a job (they were in community college) nor health insurance (most family insurance policies here have a \"loophole period\" between the ages of 18 to 23, during which dependents cannot be covered by their parents' health insurance). They did NOTHING wrong, they just had the rotten luck of being born into an impoverished family who also happened to have a history of heart problems.\n\nThen there are the groups and individuals who strongly prefer following their cultural individualism and personal values than paying higher taxes, or helping other people whom they don't know/like. Independents (depending on the sect), the right, and the far-right are most often unwilling to pay for universal healthcare because 1) they want to decide what to do with their money instead of paying taxes with it, 2) they often either don't trust or aren't supporters of the government using their tax dollars, and/or 3) they dislike or hate the idea and existance of different and/or opposing groups of people (e.g. the left, other religions and cultures, members of different socioeconomic classes, etc.) SO MUCH that they would rather oppose them on majority of issues than ever be seen as willing to concede, compromise, or work together on something that is objectively in the best interest of everyone in the nation.\nI know people who are religious and very pro-life who \"don't want [their] tax dollars to go to killing babies,\" yet when their daughters became pregnant in college, they told them \"you're an exception, and you have options, and it would be mostly covered by Planned Parenthood.\" I also have close, elderly relatives who've worked government jobs their whole lives, retired at the ages of 50, and said \"Everybody gets sick. If I didn't get them sick, then why should my taxes get raised? Why should I pay for their doctors bills? If they get sick, then they should be the ones paying.\" I've been so close to telling some of them \"Ok, then by the same token, why should I pay ANY social welfare taxes? Everybody gets old, but I don't cause them to get old, so why should I be taxed for it? Why should I have to pay for YOUR retirement? I am taxed on social welfare (i.e. Social Security) more than any of our family's previous generations - as are the rest of the people from my generation - yet I will not see one penny of that when I get older. I'm paying for you to comfortably sit on your ass in your old age and not be a productive member of society, while I will never be able to afford the same luxury.\"",
            "Because helping someone pay for their healthcare when we are overrun by preventable illnesses and injury makes it harder for the unavoidable issues people have to rise to the top.  Also, we allow people to pick worthless majors so that too is a poor investment. And lastly, being obligated isn\u2019t really a very American trait.  So, plenty of people get scholarships and health related treatments from charitable organizations and individuals, but it\u2019s their choice to give.  We are individuals with personal responsibility and freedom at the core of our being.  No one ever gave up a right or took on a major tax rate and got it back, so govt must be watched.",

            "For me, it was working emergency services in low-income areas. Lots of people in this country have the ability, but no desire to work. Our social welfare programs make it easy for them to have a free ride, including cell phones.\n\nI watched my mother put herself through nursing school while raising me as a single parent. I've met people who *deliberately* say \"fuck it, I'm living off the system.\"\n\nThat's why.",
            "This isn\u2019t exactly true. Many parents, if not most, are more than willing to help pay for their family\u2019s costs.

I think it stems more from people not trusting the government with money. It\u2019s hard to justify extra tax when all you\u2019ve ever felt is your tax money being wasted. These government entities can\u2019t even figure out how to keep streets pothole free. \nI mean look at our budget now. A huge chunk of it does go to welfare and health services. The issue is that it\u2019s so poorly run that they can hardly even sustain it for retirees it\u2019s supposed to cover.",

            "I'm sixteen (cant explain why that's relevant but feel like it is) and I do kind of agree, if you aren't old enough to legally have reddit get off of the platform, every time I see someone saying \"I'm 11\" or \",\" I'm 12\" I also see a lot of people telling them they shouldn't be here which I do appreciate. Theres nothing you can do about 13 and 14 year olds on reddit and some of them are quite mature but sometimes it just feels kind of uncomfortable",
            "Yes.\n\nI'm 14 though. I'm sorry, I just need those memes to get through the day...",
            "Yeah, for sure. I\u2019m less surprised about the 13-15 year old kids\u2014there have been kids in that age bracket on \u201cmature\u201d social media forever. But I\u2019ve definitely read posts where the person\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m 10y/o,\u201d and it\u2019s really strange. It does very much bother me. I\u2019m not gonna say we should ban them\u2014Reddit makes it very hard to do that, and I\u2019m also not really in support of the you\u2019re-wrong-for-being-naive-and-curious type of system. Kids will always want to be more adult, and I don\u2019t want to blame them for it. But it also worries me just *how* mature Reddit tends to be, and how diverse its community is. Diversity is great, until you reach the point where incels and \u201cMAP\u201d (pedophile) acceptance happen. And it\u2019s easy to lie about your age regarding NSFW stuff\u2014I know because I\u2019ve done it, and a lot of it was very regrettable.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential for predatory behavior on Reddit, too. And that\u2019s terrifying. If you\u2019re 10, you\u2019re inherently a little bit stupid. Kids are dumb. And they\u2019re gullible. If I was more involved in internet shit at that age, I would\u2019ve definitely fallen for some creepy grooming shit, if it happened to me.\n\nI think the best we can do at this point is try our best to be protective of the little kids on here. They\u2019re not banable, and they\u2019re not going to listen if we tell them to leave. So we\u2019ve gotta make sure they\u2019re safe, as much as we can.\n\nIf y\u2019all see any predatory behavior directed toward young people on Reddit (or anyone, really), call it out. Notify the person it\u2019s happening to, and report it.",

            "Oh ya dude it's horrific. Every once in a while I'll creep a profile out of boredom... I have seen some middle school aged kids with some really fringe/ violent sex interests.

            "Not to reduce the significance of actual issues but I strongly believe teenage trolls and youthful foolishness are the general reason for most of Reddit\u2019s rampant racism, harassment, and all around decline into a hostile space where open discussion that goes against the narrative is immediately shut down. \n\nNot that people of all ages aren\u2019t shitbags but there\u2019s already many stereotypes about teens online telling others they fucked their moms and such. And we know there\u2019s a massive population of the youth on Reddit. \n\nAm 26 fwiw so I\u2019m not some old out of touch fogey, just young and out of touch lol",

I have to block Reddit entirely. \n\nI think you used to have to log onto a computer to turn NSFW content on/off. Now on your iPhone settings you just go to reddit and click a tab that allows or doesn\u2019t allow NSFW material. That\u2019s convenient for adults, but there\u2019s no way for me (or any other parent) to control that other than blocking any apps that are marked 17+, which includes YouTube. \n\nLong story short, I\u2019m pretty sure any kid using reddit can easily access NSFW and adult content if they\u2019re accessing reddit at all.",

Many parents now didn't grow up with the kind of social media that 10-14 year olds are growing up with.  So there are a lot of parents that have no idea what reddit is, let alone what kind of content is on it.  So you have kids navigating the untamed wilds of the internet with no guide because parents have no idea how to regulate it or introduce it to their children in a responsible way.\n\nThe next few years as these kids grow into adults will be interesting.",
            "Im 21 now, and have been independently browsing the web since I was like 7. I've used reddit on and off since i was 12. There's always been a lot of of kids on here. And yes they do see lots of weird/fucked up shit. Thats just life in the information age",

When I pointed the stuff out to them and got on them about it, they were like \"oh shit, we didn't realize...\" \n\nI'm so much more worried about a bunch of kids getting exposed to that kind of shit and the normalization of the sexist/racist crap that permeates the rightwing subs on Reddit than them seeing some titties.",

I suppose in some subreddits it's kinda strange (I'm not in the really weird ones but I assume kids also find there way to those too), but I've had my account since I was in the 10-14 range and it's been fine. \n\nI had  parent permission and at least partial supervision for what I did on reddit (I think I joined for some super innocent hobby like pokemon or something) but recently they've definitely loosened the restrictions.\n\nIt's also kinda funny to see 13 year olds on r/teenagers celebrating their birthday and stuff.

They\u2019re above the age requirement to be on the site, and by 8th or 9th grade most kids have seen things their parents wouldn\u2019t want them to see elsewhere. I mean come on. middle schoolers.

So much of it has helped me understand just other people in general better. I think we do our youth a huge disservice by attempting to shield them from most of what we get the heebs about them knowing. \n\nI'm especially concerned you worry about people knowing stuff because of their gender. What exactly do you think one gender should not know about the other? I can't imagine anything where gender is relevant at all. Now please don't take that the wrong way as it was intended to make you think a bit, not to hurt your feelings. As a fellow old person I am constantly pleasantly surprised by how wholesomely most of this knowledge is used. Men who keep a few emergency tampons and pads for female guests comes to mind. Periods come when they come and sometimes it is a surprise. \n\nSincerely I think you should rethink your stance.",

            "tl:dr It's an artifact of the 80s/90s that rode in on century-old waves of panic about 'sexual psychopaths'.  \n  \n**These are cherry-picked excerpts and I have left a great deal out.  Go read the articles for yourself.  This post is meant to help frame part of the question, not an attempt to answer it.**  \n  \nMONSTERS, INC.: A Concise History of Sex Offender Laws  \nhttp://oncefallen.com/history.html  \n  \n>Prior to 1870, sex crimes were rarely depicted in the media, but in the 1880s, to sensational stories help to cement our fascination with the \u201csex killer\u201d \u2013 HH Holmes and Jack the Ripper. The term \u201cRipper\u201d was used to stereotype sex offenders for many years to come. With this sudden fascination with serial killers and \u201csex fiends\u201d came increase reports from the media, peaking in the early 1910s. During this time, the modern stereotype of the sex offender as a dirty old man/stranger on the prowl to seduce children with toys were candy was already starting to take shape (Jenkins p. 34-38).  \n  \n>The 1930s was a time of unparalleled economic and instability, so it is little surprise that a series of high profile cases helped create an appearance of a violent crime wave. Sensationalized cases such as The Lindbergh baby kidnapping, the Cleveland Torso Killings, and Albert Fish solidified the fears over \u201csex killers\u201d. The prominence of a national media helped to make previously localized crimes a nationwide concern (Jenkins p. 49-52). As a result of these laws, a number of reactionary laws and strategies designed to handle the perceived crime wave, including civil commitment laws, lists of known sex offenders, and castration laws were introduced (Jenkins p. 80-82, Leon p. 46).  \n  \n>[In the 1950s to 1980s] Skepticism of the justice system eventually extended to rehabilitation efforts. Rehabilitation was seen as a myth, and a paradigm shift to a punitive \u201cjust desserts\u201d doctrine was propagated by the government (Jenkins p.112-113). The Gay Rights Movement also fueled fears of \u201cpedophile rings\u201d, and the newly formed \u201cMoral Majority\u201d used these fears as anti- gay rhetoric until the AIDS epidemic provided a better avenue for exploiting public fears (Jenkins p.124-125). Pornography and obscenity as a cause for sexual deviancy became a primary focus in the 1970s, and a number of unconfirmed (i.e., bogus) statistics were cited to justify this fear (Jenkins p.145-147).  \n  \n>In 1990, the sensational trial of Earl K. Shriner led Washington State to pass a comprehensive \u201csexual predator\u201d law. Washington\u2019s legislature passed sex offender registry and community notification laws, and long-term indefinite sentences coupled with civil commitment laws (Jenkins p.191-192). The view of the sex offender as an uncontrollable monster than cannot be cured but contained supported an \u201canything goes\u201d approach to dealing with sex offenders. While this idea was not unique to this era, the unanimous support and widespread dissemination of laws are unique to the Containment Era (Leon p.113-114).  \n  \n>Registration and community notification laws made the public participants in the supervision of sex offenders. This is a very dangerous precedent. Sex offenders became targets of overt acts of vigilantism. Family members of those impacted by these laws and even victims were endangered by sex offender laws. These actions have been justified by the perceived extreme harm caused by offenders, their immunity to treatment and reform, and the danger posed to children (Jenkins p.199-200, Leon p.183-185).  \n  \n>Each wave of predator panic has held the same basic belief\u2014the image of the sex offender as an \u201cincurable\u201d \u201cmonster\u201d complete with ominous-sounding terms like \u201csex fiends\u201d, \u201csexual psychopaths\u201d, and \u201csexual predators\u201d. The monster mantra justifies novel approaches to addressing sex crimes to isolate and contain the sex offender. On the opposite end of the spectrum is the wave of skepticism that follows a collapse of the monster paradigm. The pendulum swings between the sex offender as a nuisance or sick but treatable person and the incurable monster, though the pendulum tends to spend more time on the incurable monster side of the spectrum.",

            "I believe (in the US at least) sex offender registries are relatively recent and as a reaction to repeat child sexual offenders, a subset that is prone to recidivism and gets attention in the press. As others point out, murderers are more likely to receive longer sentences and hence be much older when released\u2014if they are released at all. I\u2019m also going to guess there are more paroled/released sex offenders than murderers On the street per capita.

            "Because registries are bloated and ineffective ways to keep track of anything. \n\nSex offender registries are pretty pointless and only serve as a way to convince people that the Gov't is doing something to protect them. In reality, the overwhelming number of sex crimes are committed by people (A) not on the registry and (B) by someone known to the victim already.\n\nFurthermore, I believe that forcing people to be on a sex offender registry actually can have the opposite effect of making the public safe. The offender ultimately has a more difficult time reintegrating into society after their criminal sentence has been served. People who cant reintegrate fall into a much higher category of recidivism.\n\nObviously, something needs to be done with the higher risk sex offenders, I'm just unconvinced a public registry is the answer.\n\nSo no, I don't think registries for other crimes are appropriate either.",

After luring Megan into his home with the promise of a puppy, Timmendequas raped her, strangled her to death, and dumped her body in a park two miles away. He willingly led police to Megan\u2019s body the next day and confessed.

            "In the 80's, a kid named [Jacob Wetterling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Jacob_Wetterling) was abducted, raped, and killed. His killer was not found for *decades* as part of another abduction/rape case.\n\nHis parents, having to face the atrocity of what happened and the lack of closure, became huge advocates for what we now know of as the sex offender registry. They spread their story and it was the exact right time to whip the country into a frenzy-- *their* kid was abducted from his sleepy little town, just out being a kid, and no justice was ever found (at the time)-- **and your kid could be next**.\n\nThe country demanded fast, huge change.\n\nAnd so, the sex offender registry was adopted-- in various forms across various jurisdictions-- but Jacob Wetterling was the start.\n\nSo to hammer the point home: The sex offender registry, in some areas, has strict requirements like informing your neighbors of your status because the country went ape shit over a little kid being abducted from their \"safe\" neighborhood. \n\nAnd the illusion of safety was absolutely shattered and the reaction-- *over*reaction in my opinion, but that's a debate for another time-- was what we ended up with.\n\nMurder and kidnapping never had quite as big a single, explosive push as the Wetterling rape case had, so there was never quite the same reaction. But the creepy fucking fuck who abducted Wetterling scared the shit out of people and was seen as-- more than anything else-- a sexual deviant.  (e: I should add here that they *suspected* one guy all along but never had any evidence-- I don't recall if they actually pushed him in their public story, but a creepy sex stalker perv was definitely the image the masses took hold of)\n\nThe kidnapping and murder were just incidental to the rape, and that's what scared most people-- there's rarely a reason (in the minds of the public) to kidnap and murder a kid, unless there's rape/sexual motivation. That terrified people-- the idea that a perv would come around, stalk your kids and snatch them off the street.\n\nI got most of my information about this from a podcast mini-series called *In the Dark*-- it's a good, informative podcast that's kind of like *Serial*-lite-- they're obviously riding the coattails of Serial's popularity, but that doesn't make it a bad podcast.\n\ne: It's worth noting that, as far as I can tell-- the rapist/killer in the Wetterling case committed several of these types of crimes, but was never convicted until decades later. So the sex offender registry *wouldn't have actually helped* Wetterling-- it was just the *idea* that a sexual deviant could commit these acts that scared the shit out of people. At least, that's my understanding, but I could be mis-remembering the details a bit.",

Recidivism rates are [lower](https://www.smart.gov/SOMAPI/sec1/ch5_recidivism.html) for sex offenders than many other crimes, and most sex crimes, particularly against children, are perpetrated by a close family friend, family member, step-family member or a [priest](https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/). A sex offender registry does NOTHING to prevent these crimes. \n\nBut, politicians and judges like sounding \"tough on crime.\" Sounding tough on crime sounds much better than \"smart on crime,\" or \"compassionate to people who were in bad situations and made it worse not better.\" \n\nIn the 1984 debate between Reagan and Dukakis, the moderator started by asking Dukakis, who was against the death penalty, if he would support the death penalty for a man who hypothetically raped and murdered his wife. Dukakis did exactly the right thing and said he would not, but there was no way to come off not looking kind of weak, and rather than looking like a man of principle, he came off looking like what we'd now call a \"beta cuck.\" \n\nIt's better, therefore, to appear tough on crime and ruin people's lives rather than be sensible, principled, understanding, compassionate, forgiving, or logical.",

First let me say that I think SO registration laws are absolute bullshit and have absolutely no impact on public safety.\n\nI feel the need to address some of the troubling opinions in this post. Sex crimes are seen as particularly horrible for a few reasons. One they happen much more often than almost any other kind of personal crime (including murder). If you know more than a handful of people you probably know a survivor. Rape is more than \"15 minutes with a dick in you.\" I have women on my caseload who will never be able to have a child because of the internal injuries from being raped. I have many more women who cannot have vaginal sex due to scar tissue from their rape. I have many men on my case load and they often require extra consideration as society doesn't acknowledge or support them. They suffer in silence for most of their lives because of the stigma. The suicide rate among men who have been sexually abused is particularly troubling.\n\nMale, female, whether the sexual abuse happened as a child or adult - it has a tremendous effect on a human being's psyche. And it can do terrible things to people physically, as well. And it happens very, very often. Like I said - if you know more than a handful of people, you probably know someone who has been abused/molested/raped.\n\nIf you find yourself rolling your eyes about sexual abuse just because you feel you are in a demographic group that is immune, think again. Or perhaps develop a little empathy. Think about the fear these men and women deal with, the pain, the self-hatred. Thank you.",

This is especially true for sex offenders who target children, because adults need to monitor the spaces their children are in.\n\nI won't address the kidnapping point, because usually that is a crime linked to other crimes (rape, murder) and so addressing the topic of sex offenders and murders covers that, too.",

            "Sex offenders often have a tendency to repeat offend as their expression of sexuality is inconsistent with societal morality.\n\nWhile there do exist serial murderers, kidnappers, or other capital offenders who repeat the same offense over and over; usually murder and kidnapping are situational.  In other words, they are not likely to reoffend unless the same scenario arises again.\n\nThere are also many sex offenders whose conviction does not result in mandatory 25 to life.\n\nOn one hand an individual who is  sexually aroused by children and is unable to act on their urge is likely to reoffend upon release.  On the other hand comparatively few murderers, if they get released, walk out of the gate looking forward to their next opportunity to take a life.\n\nAlso, our society sanctions killing and kidnapping under many national security or war based purposes.  Our society does not sanction sex offenses for anything for national security or war.",

            "Having dealt with many criminals in my life I can honestly say that many are regretful of their prior actions.  \n\nHowever I can also say that sex offenders are quite the opposite.  I can see the stupidity of an adult that was convicted of Statutory Rape of a minor like a 19 year old man dating and having relations with a 16 year old male/female.  They think they are in love and hormones kick in.  I actually have a neighbor like this.  He did his time and the girl he was convicted over waited until he got out of prison and she married him when he got out.  \n\nBut when it comes to regular sex offenders that are predators I have zero respect for them and they are beyond reform."

            "Been doing it for years. Not weird. Coffee, news, music, quiet time",
            "I wouldn't say there is anything wrong with it at all. Everyone needs time to themselves, just because you have a family doesn't change that. I finish work around midnight and I enjoy being able to come home and do my own thing for a couple of hours before going to sleep.",
            "I get up at 5am too.  And it's also so I have time alone before anyone else gets up.  The main reason is that I've set aside that time to game because if I game in the evening chances are I'll get interrupted by a family pet needing to go out, a child needing something, a phone call, my wife needing something etc.  Being \"on call\" all the time doesn't give me time to really relax and get into anything because I'm constantly listening out for issues.  At 5am to 7am it's quiet, no one is up, no one needs anything and I get that time to myself uninterrupted (most of the time).  I'm not slightly on edge waiting for the next call of \"Daaaaaaad?\" or the sound of a dog scratching the door etc.\n\nI'm a much happier person because of this, it doesn't hurt anyone so it's win, win for everyone.  Everyone needs down time.  Don't worry about it.",
            "Not weird.\n\nMine is in reverse, I stay up late after everyone has gone to bed and post bad Reddit memes.",

She was annoyed at it first, because \" Don't you love me and want to spend time with me.\" After thinking about it she understands. She likes having time just to herself as well.\n\nThey love each other dearly, go on walks at the end of each workday, having weekends away with just to two of them. \n\nJust having some time to charge up and not having to deal with anybodies shit.",
            "me and my dad had a little war with this lmao. He would drive me to school at 8am and wake up at 7am and i'd wake up at 6:30am. Well he wanted up first so he woke up at 6:00am to beat me at first up. So one day I decide there is no way he'll do 5am and this madman started waking up at 4 fucking am, sometimes not even sleeping to be first up. The dude fell a sleep at the wheel a few time so I went back to 6:30am and never test the power of a dad again lmao.",
            "No it is not weird, I LOVE alone time. No one to ask me any questions or try to start up a conversation. Just me coffee and a book or just looking outside",
            "Before I had my daughter, I used to always double sleep. So I would sleep 11-3 and 5-8. Always. Like clockwork I started doing it when I was about 15 out of the blue and I went to the kitchen to make tea and discovered my father in the kitchen doing much the same. It became our little thing our midnight trists in the kitchen, having a cup of tea and doing the crossword/sudoku silently together for a few hours. \n\nI still did it like I said until recently but these days alone in my own home. I miss very much finding my dad in the kitchen and having a cuppa with him but when I visit home the tradition continues! \n\nThese 2 hours I have alone in the night, in the quiet. My sanctuary.  I can't wait to do it again in the future. Totally normal.",
            "Of course not! \n\nMe time is very important and it's not like you enjoy your family any less or are actively reducing time with your family (even then of course there's nothing wrong with this route within reasonable measurements either) you're simply *making* time for yourself and your personal wellness. \n\nYou do you.",
            "nope not weird at all my dad does the same thing. As an adult even with kids you need alone time where you can get it. My mom always said she would never take a job without at least a half hour commute because it was time to unwind and decompress on way home.",
            "No. I often stay up late to have alone time. Everyone needs time to themselves",
            "I'd say that sounds perfectly healthy and beneficial.",
            "I don't think It's weird in the slightest. I always try to get up before my family, it's lovely to have a cup of tea, read the paper and just generally gather my thoughts before the day takes over. In fact I can get a bit grumpy if I'm not able to have this alone time.",
            "Not weird. CTO in my company does exactly this, works early hours because nobody bothers him then and can work in peace. CEO would stay in till 6pm but would never work early mornings, he is the exact opposite. Both function fine.",
            "I do this too. 6 am is pretty much the only time everyone is asleep but me so I have an hour and a half to eat breakfast, watch TV and drink coffee in peace",
            "Actually those 2 hrs can be your most productive, Learn a language, paint, read, write, exercise, meditate.  As long as your wife understands ( seems she does ) keep doing it.",
            "It is uncommon to me and the people I know but it is not weird. I myself crave some alone time everyday and that's ok it might even improve your quality of life. I think it is totally fine to get that alone time. I'm quite sure you will be able to get it later on without needing to wake up that early, so don't worry my dude wanting to have alone time doesn't mean you don't like people",
            "I do it all the time even on weekends. I usually up by 4:30am when I don't work until 9:00. Been married 21yrs(no kids), but just like the time to myself to browse the internet, read Reddit, etc....Even on weekends I am typically up by 5-530",

            "I work at 5am when I have work so I have to get up early regardless. On my days off I just naturally wake up much earlier than anyone else in the house, I definitely enjoy the quiet time to my self.",
            "I don't really see a problem, everyone needs their own space and time to relax and if that means getting up a bit early to enjoy the quiet and read then so be it.  You can't expect to be around 24/7 with no time to yourself",
            "It's not wierd at all. Having some alone time is really healthy! If this works for you then keep doing it and let your wife think what she thinks.\n\nI like to take my alone time when everyone has gone to sleep. I'm not a morning person...",
            "My dad would do that.  He'd  grade papers mostly.  The funny thing is that he would be asleep in bed by 8pm. He missed so many phone calls that way!  I think he mostly wanted to do marking without being bothered.",
            "I been doing this exactly for as long as I can remember.",
            "My work requires me to be in constant contact with people and as an introvert I find that very draining. I wake up at 5.30am every weekday to have time for myself so to me it's not weird at all.",
            "No, sweetie, please don't worry about this. Many people need alone time to be with themselves and get their heads together, to make sense of the world and themselves. Some need a whole lot of alone time, some less. But whatever your needs are, it is in no way a rejection of your family. Think of it as being like recharging your batteries -- something you need to do, so that you can cheerfully give attention and patience to your loved ones when they need it. This practice probably makes you a much better companion the rest of the time. Don't worry about it.",
            "I'm doing the same thing right now, except I don't always read. So no.",
            "Everyone needs time out",
            "My husband gets up at 5am to exercise, but I also assume \"me time\", so I stay in bed to help him out. :-)\n\nMeanwhile, I stay up late for \"me time\" and it backfires because kid refuses to settle down until I'm in bed. So I hide in the bathroom and read/play games on phone for an hour just to have time alone. \n\nAnd both of these were BEFORE the pandemic. Me time is essential during a pandemic.",
            "Dude, I\u2019m up at 6am every day. Even on my days off. To me, *nothing* beats that alone time in the morning.",
            "If you think you're weird, I sometimes just go and sit on the toilet to be left alone for a bit.",
            "My grandpa told my dad he always got up 2 hours early because nobody had a chance to fuck up his day yet so you\u2019re not alone",
            "It's not just \"not weird\", it's absolutely normal. The only weird thing to me is being disciplined enough to wake up at 5am.",
            "i'm not married but live with my partner and children but i also do the same! Not always reading some times i just sit in the living room on my own and watch the news etc.\n\nI don't think it's weird or a bad sign my friend just enjoy the peace :)",
            "I do this. My wife also thinks it's wierd, but I also walk the dog during this time so she doesn't complain.",
            "I do this all the time and find that it makes me happier to dedicate some time to myself. It's completely normal to want some peace and quiet. I usually play a videogame or just scroll on my phone or read a book in the living room until either the baby wales up or wife needs something.",
            "I don't have a family. But I cherish the alone time I get in the afternoon before my girlfriend gets home. Nothing wrong with it in my eyes. We all need our own time my man. Keep doing what you're doing if it's making you happy!",
            "I dont think it is - having time alone I think is an act of self care. \n\nI love my daughter more than anything in this world. But I occasionally get up an hour or two earlier than necessary in the morning so I can get some \"relax\" time. \n\n\nI think, as parents, or spouses, it can be easy to get caught up in what you think you \"should\" be doing. You're not taking your time *away* from your family, you're just making extra time in the morning for yourself.",
            "Ok, wait... it all sounded legit until you said \"like usually people love to spend time with their families.\" There's nothing wrong with wanting variety but you need to ask yourself, not us, how you feel about the time you do spend with them.",
            "Sounds normal. A lot of people I know do that. Apparently it's even recommended in some circles/professions/religions to wake up early for personal/quiet time.",
            "Totally normal. My gf likes to sleep in and I\u2019m usually up 1-2 hour before her and also enjoy that alone time. She likes to stay up later than me so she gets her own couple of hours after I go to bed.",
            "No, that's the same reason I stay up two hours after everyone else.\n\nOne of my mates gets up and runs serious ks while everyone sensible is still in bed, just for time on his own.\n\nIt's fairly normal to want time exclusively to yourself.\n\nI have too much at the moment.  I can't be trusted.",
            "I'm a younger college student and I do it every morning. Not weird at all. It's nice and it feels more productive and relaxing in my opinion. If I had children I'd for sure be waking up early to get some alone time. Having loved ones is a great thing but you also need time to give yourself some love.",
            "If I had the energy I would do the same exact thing.",
            "I do this most days for the explicit purpose of getting things done uninterrupted.",
            "Not weird at all - we all need our recharge time.\n\nOn a similar note, I start work between 7-7:30am purely so I can have some quiet time alone (or close to it) in the office before the daily rush begins. It's a good way to set yourself up for the day.",
            "I do this but sleeping later than everyone else.",
            "Not weird. My husband likes his alone hour in the mornings and I often get to work an hour or 2 before other people because I get more shit done in our open plan office when nobody else is there.",
            "Not at all. I'm not married, but i always get up a bit earlier so I can have time to relax before every body wakes up. Think it might be very healthy, i personally feel better the days i do this.",
            "No ways! You enjoy that free time. I love to go for a walk by myself, sometimes ill walk as long as 3 hours. Alone time is such an underrated thing, people dont understand how pressure relieving it is and how nice it is to just chill with your own brain. \n\nDont you ever feel bad about something you enjoy that dosnt affect other people.",
            "I\u2019m doing this now. :)",
            "I do the exact same thing. Time for yourself is important.",
            "Nothing wrong with that.",
            "hell no! go you!",
            "I tend to do it. It's not hard though, lol. I definitely take after my dad who wakes up super early even when he doesn't work. My mom and brother are lucky to wake up by 11 or 12 on a day off.",
            "I'm currently doing that right now.",
            "You\u2019re recharging batteries that don\u2019t benefit from sleep. \n\nIt is not bad.",
            "Completely normal. It's good and healthy to intentionally maintain time for yourself. Sometimes that's during the day, where the other spouse watches the kids for an hour so you can go do a thing, and sometimes it's carved out time that you set aside for yourself. You might want to consider having this conversation with your spouse, asking her if the two of you could intentionally set up protected time for the other one so you each get some personal space and don't have to wake up at 5am.",
            "Nah. A man needs his alone time",
            "What's weird is that you write 5 am as \"5h00\", lol.  Just kidding. \n\nMale, married 20+ years here with 2 kids, my wife usually gets up between 4 and 5 am for quiet time. She'll often run the dishwasher or do laundry while she's up, and read or watch TV while that is going on.  \n\nSo, my tip - during your quiet time, if it does not disturb others in the household - do a few chores (sweep, laundry, dishes) during the quiet time. I guarantee your wife will stop questioning your early hours, lol.",
            "This is exactly what I do. I have to leave for work at 6am, but I naturally wake up between 3 and 4. When I wake up I just get up. I enjoy my coffee, read articles or watch YouTube videos. If I woke up and rushed to get ready and fly to work, I'd be super ill all the time.",
            "Same. I do love my family and do spend time with them, but I need time alone to feel okay. It takes energy for me to be around people all the time. I just feel psychologically wiped out without the quiet.\n\n(Edit: for context, I have 5 kids. The noise can get pretty intense.)",
            "I require alone time, and I\u2019m an early riser; so I\u2019m in the same boat. I\u2019m married with small children and my house is very loud and chaotic, although full of love. However I cherish my alone time! I hang out in my recliner in my garage, listen to the news and scroll etc. Some people just require space, if you can accomplish this while your family is sleeping; win win. Don\u2019t waste a second beating yourself up about it, I don\u2019t believe in self bashing. You\u2019re just taking care of your mental health at no ones expense. Bonus: getting to watch the sunrise. \u2600\ufe0f",
            "Not weird at all! I love the people in my life dearly but I *need* my alone time.",
            "I do this. Expect I stay up after everyone goes to bed for my alone time. I love my family, but sometimes you need a little you time as well.",
            "If I didn't love sleep I'd do that as well. I used to be able to play games even for a little bit each week, I haven't played in over a year it's rough. Mental health through any outlet is important so you don't get burned out. Do you",
            "There's nothing wrong with this at all. Everyone needs some alone time, but that doesn't mean you love your family any less. Totally normal and healthy.",
            "Right now it's 6:47 am and no one in my house will wake up for at least an hour and a half. I'm going to sit on the porch and watch the sunset. This is the way.",

            "Not weird, especially with kids involved. We all have different tolerances for how much energy we can outlay before we need to get recharged and we all have different needs for what recharges us. \n\nTo me it sounds like you\u2019ve found a really excellent method of doing that where you\u2019re not hurting anyone or ignoring anyone\u2019s needs (yours included). \n\nIf anything I think you should be applauded. \n\n(Married 14 years myself, too but no kids. Wife and I spend almost every waking moment together in the same house and we love it. Even still we need alone time now and then because that\u2019s just how humans do)",

            "nope. This is normally one of the things put on every \"top ten habits of succesful people\" lists",
            "Definitely not weird or bad. Everyone needs alone time to recharge!",
            "This is not weird at all.  I have always gotten up hours before anyone else and still do even though I'm no longer married.  I'm up by 5 as well and love the quiet time before my daughter is up.  Everyone needs time to themselves.",
            "Lawyer up. Delete Facebook. Hit the gym.",
            "No weirder than staying up a couple hours after everyone has gone to bed. I\u2019m an introvert and definitely need some me time every day!",
            "That\u2019s called self-care. I sometimes stay up after my partner goes to bed for this exact reason. Alone time is important, you take it where you can get it, and needing it DOES NOT mean you don\u2019t love your partner or your family. In fact, it probably makes you a better parent or partner because you\u2019re consciously setting aside time to care for yourself. Everyone is different and we all need time to recharge our physical and emotional batteries in whatever way works for each individual; taking time for self-care allows us to be the best versions of ourselves for those we love.",
            "Growing up my mom had her horse barn/chickens to tend to and dad was always in the shop tinkering on the cars.\n\nMany many years of marriage later and they stand by it, the only way to make it together is to have your own thing and not let it be seen negatively. It was never \"I'm angry I'll be in the shop\" or \"your moms avoiding me out in the barn\"\n\nLiterally best friends. Always get along. Have their own creative spaces. Works like a charm.",
            "This is literally why most VP\u2019s, CEO\u2019s etc. get up early in the morning. They need time to think and actually get work done without interruptions and before they start their 8 hours of back to back meetings with no lunch. \n\nPersonally I\u2019m a Night Owl so am usually most productive when everyone else is asleep but the theories the same.",
            "I can tell my wife wants to be alone in the morning. She gets up two hours earlier than I do, to write, meditate and bake cookies. This is fine, except when she then wakes me up with a cup of tea and starts brightly and loudly asking me my plans for the day.",
            "Not weird at all. I do this every morning and I\u2019m alone. It\u2019s just a nice me time for me to enjoy my coffee, plants, yoga, etc. it\u2019s nice knowing that no one is going to bother me or that I have be alert about work emails/calls. I also really enjoy the quietness of it.",
            "I really think it's normal. I hate waking up and having to rush, or waking up to everyone else being up. I like the peace and quiet. I like my coffee, my news, I plan what I wanna do for the day and once every wakes up I'm good. I love my family, but peace and quiet in the morning is my meditation.",
            "Once I discovered this it changed my life. I used to always sleep really late, get up last minute for everything etc. Then I realised that the absolute best thing on earth is waking up super early, making a coffee and sitting in bed reading the news, seeing what\u2019s going on the world, reading, whatever. It\u2019s not just alone time, it also allows you time to ease into the day, to wake up a bit and orientate yourself before going to work.\n\nNow it\u2019s absolutely, unquestionably my favourite time of ever day. \n\nAs to being married, my wife wakes up too and we both enjoy this. We don\u2019t talk much but we will make coffee for each other and just chill beside each other in bed for an hour or two. No kids yet but I can imagine that will ruin everything.",

            "I do the same. But in the evenings. \n\nMy three year old goes to bed at 7pm. My wife usually goes to bed at 10pm. That gives me usually 2 or 3 glorious hours of pure peace and quiet. \n\nI love my family but i love my personal time as well. There is nothing to be ashamed of imo.",
            "Doesn't sound weird. It sounds like healthy self care.",
            "Sneak those extra minutes back!! Fosho!",
            "I deliberately stay up after everyone else has gone to sleep even when I\u2019m tired because it\u2019s the only time I get to myself in the house.",
            "I used to when my kids were babies. A little alone time is not a bad thing. If thats when you have the time and it works, then go for it.",
            "Everyone needs some quiet time on their life. I don't even have kids yet and I do this. It's not weird.",
            "It's not weird at all.  \nI've known a lot of men who wake up early like this.  Almost all of them were devoted family men.  They all did things with this time that required solitude.  Work out, running, prayer or bible study were common.  Basically they didn't want to take time away from their families to pursue these things, so they sacrificed sleep to do the thing.  I personally wake up first (45 minutes) so I can cook breakfast, and get to work early, and get off early (in the before times, when time clocks mattered).",
            "Used to do it before my daughter was born.  Wake up at 5am and play World of Warcraft for two hours before she would get up.  There was a group of 4 others I knew online we\u2019d all play together doing the same thing.  Getting in game time before wife/ kids woke up.",
            "I am up three hours earlier than everyone in my house. I get a workout in and play my Xbox on low volume of course...",
            "I don't think it is weird at all. We all need time to ourselves. I do the same thing myself although I don't read much. [I like to spend alone time in prayer.](https://youtu.be/u8vjwsPOicg)\nThis gives me time to really open up to, God, and clear my heart. I guess we all have our own preferences.",
            "Same!  \nnot weird. I wake up at 5am every day. Workout from 5am-6am, then from 6am-7am I write. If the fam still isn't up by 7am I do whatever want! Eat cereal, play League of Legends, watch YouTube.   \nSome of the best 2 hours.   \n\n\nYou gotta remember you can't care for others if you don't care for yourself. Your not going to be a loving, caring husband and father if your grumpy and feel like your mental/spiritual/emotional wellbeing isn't in order.",
            "Nope, i will stay up late too on occasion. Some times it feels like a nice reset. Special since being quarantine, it's bliss.",
            "If I didn't get up an hour or so earlier than anyone else for my morning hate runs I'd of killed everyone in the house years ago. Been married almost 10 years. Two kids in single digits, a MIL and a stinky ass hound. It's the only \"me\" thing I have. I love spending any and all my time with the family, I'm the stay home parent, but I need this.",
            "If I have to get up at fucking 5 am to have some time alone you are allowed to end my suffering. This gives me nightmares.",
            "I do this every morning. I personally like to think of it as a sign of how strong my relationship with my husband is. We are confident enough in our love for each other to know that we are our best selves when we each get our alone time. So I get the early hours 5a to 7 or 8a and he gets the evening 9p or 10p on. Long term relationships are all about balance.",
            "I do the same thing.  My mornings are my sacred space.  About 2.5 years ago when I first got out of drug rehab and was living in a Sober living house, I had to live with 15 other women with 4 of them being in my room.  The only time I had to myself was super early in the morning.  I now live in a house with other people in recovery (not a sober living house, we're just all clean and sober) and I still do the same thing even though I have my own room.  My mornings are when I meditate and my favorite part of my day.",
            "Not married, but I treasure my alone time in those wee hours to do whatever. I keep that up when I say, visit my parents or such. I always get a little bummed if someone else happens to wake-up before I've had my first little cup, haha but c'est la vie!\n\nNot weird or bad sign, we all deserve a little time to ourselves.",
            "Not weird. Self coping, yeah, probably. Totally normal. \n\nHonestly, I truly love my kids and my wife and I get a sinking and low feeling if I think of life without them...\n\nThat said.... no one, and I mean no one else absolutley irritates the shit out of me more than they do....\n\nSo a couple of hours of \u201cquiet time\u201d is much needed medicine for their irritating ways.",
            "I do this, but the other way around. I stay awake late into the night. It\u2019s quiet, and everyone is asleep so no interruptions from my cell phone. I don\u2019t sleep much as it is, four hours or so is the most I usually get, so the extremely late nights aren\u2019t an issue for me. The complete silence in the cold of winter, the crickets and cicadas of spring and summer, the growl of the wind in autumn....there\u2019s just something special about the night for me. It feels comfortable to me, I suppose.",
            "I don't see any difference in getting up early for \"me time\" vs staying up late. My wife goes to bed pretty early. I stay up for several hours afterwards. I read, watch some TV. Read Reddit.",
            "Its not a bad sign necessarily. People need time alone! People need time apart! Constantly beaing with my love during this pandemic has been so tough. I started staying un the guest room for alone time and weve been so much better!",
            "You\u2019re taking good care of yourself which probably impacts your family in many good ways.",
            "I do this, I've done this since since I was a teenager. I always thought it was because I was a superior being. Now you've got me thinking I'm some kind if weirdo.\n\n*P. S. - married 33 years, I do not hate my spouse.",
            "Reminds me of that post about revenge bedtime procrastination.\n\n> a phenomenon in which people who don\u2019t have much control over their daytime life refuse to sleep early in order to regain some sense of freedom during late night hours\n\nIt\u2019s like the morning version of it.",
            "NO! It is not weird it is smart. Everyone needs some alone time. You are smart enough to do it as soon as you wake up and everyone else is asleep. I wish I did this. [+]",
            "I'm mostly just jealous you have a job and kids and still somehow have the energy to wake up at 5.00am for freaking leisure.",
            "My partner does this. We\u2019ve been together 4 years and have an 18month old and 3 month old. He gets up at 4am and reads, watches YouTube etc etc until 530am when our 18mo wakes up and then gets him up, changed, makes his breakfast and they eat and play until 6am when he wakes me up so he can leave for work. He loves his quiet time and his 1-1 with the 18mo and I need the sleep after feeding the baby so it\u2019s a win for everyone!",
            "I'm doing it right now!  Have for years!",
            "I do this every day and have been doing it every day since college. I have done it while single or while living with someone. I need about 1-2 hours to become ready to go about my day or interact with people. It\u2019s not a bad sign.",
            "Nope",
            "Absolutely not bro it\u2019s a vibe",
            "No it's healthier and better than my tactic of staying up late because I need time alone too",
            "If your significant other responds with something along the lines of \"Well I want to spend all my time with you, and if you can't match that then I don't want to be with someone who doesn't want to be with me?\" is that a red flag? \n\nIt doesn't sound like that all the time, but thats the basic sentiment. I love her a lot obviously and want to stay with her, but we've had plenty of issues (and some fantastic times aswell) and her not respecting my desire to have some personal time is frustrating. \n\nJust for info, we're both in 20 y/o and in college.",
            "This is actually extremely common, and not just for married folks with families. I live alone and do this because it\u2019s the only time no one is calling or texting and I can have peace for just a little while.",
            "There are two types of people: introverts and extroverts.  If a person is an introvert they recharge their \u201cbatteries\u201d by being alone, quiet, reading, solitary time-if a person is an extrovert their \u201cbatteries\u201d are recharged by being around others; talking and doing with others.  And then there are folks who are a combination of both types.  It is just one of the ways we are different from each other-one type isn\u2019t better than another-just different-like being right or left handed.  It is a very good thing to know how to charge your \u201cbatteries\u201d and if getting up 2 hours early to do that so you are at your best for the rest of the day-I say kudos to you-you are in tune with what you need to do.  If you don\u2019t take care of yourself-how are you going to help/support others? There are lots of books and other information about introversion/extroversion-really fascinating stuff.  If you can do some research-sounds like you may be an introvert-and each type has their characteristics.  Took me a long time but I finally figured I am an introvert and need that quiet time, too.  Nothing wrong with that-just a difference.  Viva la difference!",
            "Yes, yes and yes, get up at 6:30 every morning have coffee, stoke my wood stove watch the sun slowly hit the mountain peaks 20 miles away, watch what ever news with the sound off and my girlfriend sleeps in for two hours.",
            "My husband spends like an hour a day pooping. \n\nCome on,  he's not pooping.  He's reading comics and getting quiet time. \n\nMe? I don't need that.  I hate being alone.  But everybody is different and some people just need some alone time.",
            "I live in a family if nine people, and I wake up four hours earlier than everyone else for the same reason. Having time alone is necessary and healthy, you're fine!",

            "Being a spouse and father is really tough. It\u2019s wonderful and rewarding but also exhausting. It can feel at times that your family constantly needs something from you and that can really wear one out. It is totally fine to need some alone time, it\u2019s also totally fine to need someone else to help give you that alone time. I\u2019m a full time father and sometimes I ask my parents to look after my daughter just to take a solo mental health day. It\u2019s important!",
            "I told my wife straight up I want to buy a house an hour away from work explicitly for the commute. It's all rural highway with little traffic and that means I get a couple hours a day of peace and solitude.",

            "Space is absolutely healthy in a relationship, you have your own identity and you need to be able to have alone time especially if you desire it.",
            "It would be nice if you gave your wife me time too. Look after the kids outside of the house for 2 hours to make up for it. But I agree everyone needs me time, nothing wrong with it at all",
            "Why can't you get time when the kids go to bed? What do you do at night. Board meetings and scrabble with the wife?",
            "Not weird. Everyone needs quiet alone time. It's more weird your wife cares. That's the bad sign. Shows manipulative tendencies.",
            "Yes it\u2019s weird. But here\u2019s the thing:  if it makes you happy and it isn\u2019t hurting anyone, have at it. Being weird is just being you.",
