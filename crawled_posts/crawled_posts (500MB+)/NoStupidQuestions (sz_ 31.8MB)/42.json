My coworkers called me white and I referred to them as black and no one got upset, they did assume I voted for Trump but I would laugh it off and correct them. Also I worked security in Baton Rouge with black people and they all refered to people over the radio by skin color.

Their only shared cultural heritage is the shared experience of being Black in America. That is why the term \"African-American\" was coined.",

            "So, I'm older, in my mid-50s, and was around when there was a switch from 'Black' to 'African-American'.  When I was in the Army Nation Guard, there were a lot of people of different ages and backgrounds.  In the early 90's, younger folks who were Black would correct you if you used that word, and tell you to use 'African American' instead.  Then older folks who were also Black would say 'No, use Black.  Our generation made that a good word, Black is Beautiful'.  I was torn because unlike some of the racist white people I served with, I wanted to be respectful of my co-workers.  It ended up by using one word when older people were around, and the other with younger.  It was kind of an awkward time.  Now I think that both words are equally acceptable, maybe someone who has significant African ancestry would comment?\n\nI think that this process could have been called rebranding.  It was a way to acknowledge African heritage and maybe move away from some of the racism at the time.",
            "Also there are quite a few Africans who are not black.",
            "I had a history professor in college who was talking about race in North America, and he mentioned African Americans in Canada a few times before I raised my hand and said \"don't you mean African Canadians?\" The class started laughing, and he threw me out.",

I mean \"black\" wouldn't really be accurate either just like \"white\" isn't. I guess you could say High, Medium, or Low melanin? \nBut basically they wanted standard names for classifying everyone by their racial background. Like Asian, white, Hispanic, etc. Remember, not all \"Hispanics\" have Spanish lineage. Many come from Portugal or other European colonization/immigration.",
            "African-American refers to the specific group of people that were born in America that are decedents of slaves. This is not a reference to modern immigrants coming from the continent of Africa. Someone said it\u2019s not acceptable to refer to the ethnicity of a person as black in general terms, this is not true in my experience in academia. \n\nWhen taking my Rise and Fall of Apartheid course if I was referring the entire group of black South Africans it was okay to use the term black. When I wanted to be more specific about say the Xhosa people and their experiences and contributions in comparison to the Zulu I would use their specific identification.\n\nWhat\u2019s most important to remember is language is organic like society. As society\u2019s views and opinions change so does language. People take and have a right to ownership of the terms used to describe them and as long as your intent is to respect that you should not have to worry about offending anyone.",

            "Most African Americans did not personally immigrate from Africa, but most don\u2019t have black skins, either. Americans commonly talk about themselves as Irish American or Mexican American or Japanese American even when they and their parents were born in the United States. Using the term \u201cAfrican American\u201d normalizes the sub-Saharan ethnicity, instead of buying into discredited race theories about \u201cblacks\u201d or \u201cnegros\u201d (which literally means blacks).",
            "Americans _do not_ call all black people African Americans. I've been young, gifted, and black for all of my 30ish years, and I learned that from my parents. Didn't really see a whole lot of \"African American\" outside of the most formal of circumstances. \n\nI think African American was a sort of a way of being more politically correct about the emancipated black American culture in more restrictive settings. And many Americans simply aren't used to referring to black people in any other context, so they use it (incorrectly) as a synonym. It hasn't existed like that for very long, though. And I don't think it will last much longer because most people generally don't use it that way.",

            "Honestly, it varies per black person. A lot of us are okay with simply being called black, however, understandably, a lot of us are okay with African American because of our ancestors. Most of us whose families have been here for generations are the defendants of slaves, whose countries of origin are largely unknown to most of us. So because of that ancestry, the identity African American is used. However, its also understandable that because most of us are not DIRECT descendants of Africans (as opposed to several generations down), we shouldn\u2019t be called that. Especially when you consider that there are a lot of black families whose origin is not of Africa nor were descendants of slaves, and theres also stark contrasts in the cultures of Africans who directly immigrated from Africa and black people who are from here. There\u2019s a lot of debate as to whether it\u2019s favorable to still use the term though, even in the black community. I personally am someone who doesn\u2019t mind being referred to either, but someone else may have a different view.",
            "Additionally to what others said, there is a historical dimension. The very short version is that most Black people in the USA are descendants of slaves who don't know where their family originally was deported from. All other immigrants were something-American. So calling themselves African-American was a way of empowering and regaining connection to a homeland albeit imagined as Africa is not a unitary state. But this Pan-African imagined Homeland gave some sense of \"home\", thus African-American.",

The American part is a given if you live here.  With modern genealogy, people can now find out their origins if they chose to. I think the term will become antiquated in the near future.",

Meanwhile the business model is to sell the printer as cheap as possible (maybe even at a loss) and make up the money on ink cartridge sales, so there's incentive to cut every corner on build quality if it makes it possible to sell the end result even cheaper.\n\nIf you want a reliable printer, look for one that _just does one thing_ (all the multifunction printer/scanner/copier/fax/shredder/espresso stuff just adds more complications and things that can go wrong) and be prepared to spend extra for quality. \n\nOr buy a laser printer - toner cartridges last way longer than ink cartridges, which flips the business model away from selling refills. Colour lasers are pricey, but a black and white laser printer can be reasonably inexpensive and is a better bet for reliability than an equivalent inkjet.",

They told single-stream businesses like Lexmark that they would only sell printers that cost $50 or less. As Walmart is roughly 30% of all sales of anything in the United States (at the time) you had to do what the monopoly wanted. So factories were exported over seas, R&D budgets were slashed, and the 'we will have to make our profit off ink cartridges instead' model was implemented. So the printers had to be made a shitty and cheaply as possible in order to be allowed to sell them at all.  \n\n\nAll his years at Lexmark turned him to hating capitalism and the unfree market.

I read about a man who maintained computer equipment for a small firm that found 10yo cartridges for his printers that had been stored and forgotten, he put them in and they worked without a hitch. The toner cartridge technology has gotten perfected, even to the point of making them easy to install.\n\nI don't remember how many years I used this before I needed to replace the B&W cartridge.

If you want to buy a printer that's big enough for a small to medium office setting these days they almost always come with a subscription to a maintenance and ink refill program to make sure you continue buying the \"correct\" ink and do regular maintenance (aka spending money)... A lot of printers won't even accept any cartridges other than the ones made specifically for that printer anymore.\n\nBut apparently that's not enough, because they want you to also buy a new printer every few years, meaning the printer is made with incredibly cheap parts and lasts about 1/10th as long as it could. Planned obsolescence is far from an uncommon business practice, but the real problem is that every printing company is buying into the business model.\n\nIs it possible to make a superior product that doesn't break down as often? Is it possible to make a universal ink cartridge or even one that works across all \\[OG printing company\\]? Do even the printers at \\[OG printing company\\] break down all the time? The answer to all of these questions is \"yes, but money is more important\".\n\nThe one place all the printing companies actually compete is in the large scale printing production market, any machine made for a large office or printing central company is made to last and costs a fortune.\n\nTLDR: money money money money money",

            "As a quick note: it really hasn't been that many years. The Rolling Stones, Stevie Wonder, and Paul McCartney of the Beatles, who all still play concerts today, have been playing music continuously for a longer time than the existence of literally all electronic printers. That said, as a former robotics engineer I  can unequivocally say: printers are the most sophisticated robots we interact with on a daily basis. It has moving parts that operate fully autonomously with limited human intervention at high speeds and can generalize very well (can print any picture on many types of paper, can feed papers at different speeds as needed, can flip pages to print double sided, etc). There are a lot of deeper answers to this question (cheap printers vs expensive printers, etc) but the bottom line is that the simplest form of a computer printer, aka a dot matrix printer, probably would work well. You could, for an affordable price, make a dot printer (or a line printer) that did one page at a time and did so extremely reliably. However, there are two main barriers: humans and digital media.  \n\n\nHumans are always a problem with any kind of robot because we easily disenchanted and anthropomorphize everything. Consider air traffic control: it is an example of machine learning at work, takes a wild amount expertise, communication, and coordination, and modern air travel would literally not work without it, yet no one thinks about air traffic control as a technology worth celebrating. We already think of it as something that we just expect to always work. The same goes for printers. If we were to go back a mere 50 years and show you something, anything, that could print a picture from a computer (to say nothing of the miracle of digital pictures) it would blow your mind. And then you would promptly expect it and it would become normal. This is why we always feel the need for a printer that prints faster, or has more features, or can print lots of types of paper: we as people are rarely satisfied with the miracles we do have. On top of that, the smarter something seems, the more human (or superhuman) we expect it to be. When Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant listen to us, \"think\" about our questions, and answer us in generated speech, we think they are intelligent, set our expectations too high, and get frustrated when they don't understand us. Similarly with printers, we see some of them able to print images better than any of us could draw, and we think of them as perfect machine artists, so when a picture comes out looking like crap we get frustrated. We are constantly unappreciative of our own innovation and set expectations based on things seeming intelligent as actually being intelligent.  \n\n\nDigital media, and the Internet in general as a means of spreading it, has also stymied progress on personally available printers because, frankly, demand is bad. Now that everyone has a 100+ ppi (pixels per inch) screen in their pocket, on their computer, on their tablet, and in many cases multiple on the walls of their home, demand for good cheap printing has stopped increasing, and with that decline in demand has been a decline in printing innovation.  At this point even most new billboards are screens. After all, why use something like paper that can be any image, but only until you print and then its just that one thing, as opposed to something infinitely reusable like a screen. In the end, printers work worse than we might hope at this point because, frankly, they are becoming a niche product.",

            "We actually could have good printers that are really cheap to use but the problem is the printer industry is corrupt. The current business model for printers is for the company to give you the printer and sell you the ink. Most printer brands sell their printers really cheap infact even at a loss selling the printer for less than it cost to manufacture. Then they sell you the ink cartridges at massive markups. Those ink cartridges cost pennies to produce yet they are ridiculously overpriced. They also intentionally don't fill the cartridges up all the way and they make it where if one color in your cartidge runs out you have to replace the whole thing before you can print anything even if your not using that particular color. The cartidges are also proprietary so if you buy a companies printer you are stuck buying their ridiculous overprice cartridges or buy a whole new printer. They do however make printers now that have a tank you refill with ink from a bottle and it's much cheaper and better for the enviornement. Refillable printers are far more expensive upfront but if you print alot or use the printer long term it will save you money and put less waste into a landfill.",
            "Buy an expensive printer that doesn't use selling ink as their business model.",
            "A few reasons. Printers are not \"plug and play\" devices. This means very rarely, if ever, can you just plug a printer in and have it print something. It requires proprietary driver software in order for your computer to know what the hell it is. Like if someone handed you a piece of paper with a line drawn on it and said \"these are directions\" you'd be like \"what the actual fuck is this\" but if they gave you a map with the same line drawn on it you'd be able to tell something useful from it, the driver software is like a map for the computer that tells it how to deal with the printer.\n\nThe problem here is that there are literally thousands maybe even hundreds of thousands of operating system/hardware/software environments when it comes to computers, so these drivers are rarely updated for consumer grade printers and they are very old and old drivers don't mix very well with new software - they may work fine for a while but when your PC gets upgraded to Windows 35 and your printer driver is still written for Vista it can break things. Windows does an OK job at finding drivers for you when they are available, but if there are none available...ope. \n\nThe second problem is that printers are COMPLICATED fucking devices. There are so many tiny parts, and so many of them have to move and jerk back and forth or spin or flip or sense things. There are rollers that wear down, there are plastic arms that break, springs that wear out or snap, and sensors that get dirty. As things wear out it can lead to problems with paper feed, or sensing there is even paper in the printer. These parts aren't scientifically complex by today's standards, but printers are not exactly the cheapest peripheral devices to buy, so if they made these parts any more robust you would be paying 3 or 4 times the cost for a printer. It's almost better in a way to be able to go and buy a new printer for 80 bucks or so when yours breaks in a year or two than have to pay 400 dollars - most consumers don't really print that many documents to justify that cost.\n\nThis is why high end Xerox machines are INCREDIBLY expensive, it's not just the bells and whistles they have, it's the quality of the parts used. They are much more robust than consumer grade printers and typically require a tech to service them if something goes wrong more than a paper jam or changing a toner cartridge.",

To many, paper is paper is paper. Cheap paper doesn't absorb ink properly. Cheap paper is also thinner, generally. This causes issues where ink stains through paper, the paper doesn't hold the ink, then the paper keeps feeding through the system redistributing the ink clogging the internals of the machine. Now combine this with poorly, cheaply made parts and you have a printer that breaks down on you after only a few uses.\n\nWhile there are many factors to consider when purchasing paper (like color, brightness, gloss, etc) the best to focus on is weight. Buying heavier paper (22 as opposed to 20 pound) often helps alleviate some problems. \n\nThat being said, a cheap printer will perform as a cheap printer will. They're not designed to do anything more than to meet minimum customer demand and are often just a gateway to sell exclusive toner cartridges.\n\nBuying a decent $400 laser printer that lasts for 9 years is cheaper than buying a brand new $50 printer every year. If you're in the market, research quality printers. I recommend Xerox, Epson, and Brother. I personally have a Xerox 4510 (black and white only) and have been using it faithfully for the past decade.

Now I also realize that when I started middleschool, I also started to become a new person, with new friends, interesrs and motivation/goals.\n\nI wonder how many times we \"die\" throught our lives, how many versions of ourselves do we shed and leave behind.  What events in our lives serve as turning points or wether we know it or not at the time, the end of one of our many \"eras\".",

For example, I always associate The Beatles with road trips because that\u2019s what my family would always listen to on vacations when I was little.

As I've aged, I learned that music is very emotional for me, and when I'm down is a very bad time to listen to certain stuff.... But that's what I want to hear when I'm in a depressed phase.  I go long stretches without music, because of that.",

            "I do something similar I guess. My go to bar trick is that I can narrow down the exact year of any popular song in the last 40 years, by thinking about the stage of my life when I listened to it and the people I listened to it with, coupled with a location where I lived, friends, and where I worked at the time, it's pretty easy for me. I have a really good memory with music too. It amazes people all the time. I get it right 4 out of 5 times and when I'm wrong it's only by a year + or -.",
            "This is very common. Memories elicited by hearing music are called Music-enhanced autobiographical memories (MEAMS). They are often experienced as being involuntary memories because they occur automatically. This in contrast to a conscious retrieval process, as might occur if you were asked to think back to what happened on your birthday last year. MEAMS can conjure up quite powerful emotion and detail. In fact, the power of music to evoke memories has even been demonstrated in people with mild Alzheimer's. When asked to describe in detail and event in their life, patients with Alzheimer's had increased memory performance when listening to music.",

            "Yup, I see myself as:\n\n1. **Not-developed music taste era**. When I mostly heard my family's music which I'm really fond to. I heard mostly Vangelis, Bossa, Louis and Ella, and started to listen techno, house but never developed a real taste about it. Lots of pop and alternative, Gorillaz, RHCP, Nirvana (I'm a 90's kid). Some Backstreet boys. And started with Limp Bizkit and Rammstein weird era, early mostly driven by my family and what was available in music tv channels. \n1. **Some things I enjoyed, but not solid tastes still era**. Nu-metal was there but I really listened Rammstein first albums. Also liked 50's and 60's, it was a really joyful and now nostalgic time because my dad started to buy music of his personal favorites. Lot's of Billie holiday, I really liked her voice, and more compared to Ella. Stopped the Vangelis thing, kept with Nirvana and the RHCP. Also Francis Lai and other french but, never at this era listened to Serge Gainsbourg, thou one of my favorite songs was Je t'aime, moi non plus sang by Michel Pascall. I was so into Bossa, because there's this little melody of Antonio Carlos Jobim, Lamento from his album Wave. Also started to listen Jack Johnson. At the time music was a thing you listened because you liked how it sounded, but I started to feel there was more about it.\n1. **\"Classical\" music era**. I thought I was studying music by myself, but in the reality I was just chronologically listening to *\"Classical\"* music. Just started to listen to what was available: Chopin, Ravel, Dvorak, Bach to name some. I started to feel really attracted to the emotionalism. My favorite from this era is: Ravel, with its Piano concerto for the right hand, Pavane pour une infante d\u00e9funte, Pavane de la Belle au bois dormant. Chopin with its Nocturne in B flat minor, Op. 9 no. 1. and others.\n1. **More developed and more emotional era.** I started to listen more composers. This is because I started University and music was there and I found a really really exclusive record store in my city. So exclusive that the guy that ran it told he work for some \"classical\" record labels and that he opened that store because he was retired and never wanted to stop working. He told me I was one of his few customers and the only one that came back the most and the youngest. We became friends, share some music we owned, like some jewels we happened to found digging. Then one day his store closed and I cried and felt terrible for months. I started to feel music, like to cry with music, to be joyful, to be with anger like courageous with adrenaline. From this time I started to listen to Sibelius. Personal choice is the last moments from the Symphony No.5 In E Flat. Also bought Tchaikovsky's last three symphonies, which became the one of my most listened records. I loved to feel not just sad, but broken melancholic, I loved being desolated like in Mahler's 9th. There was a lot of new things, Prokofiev's Piano Concerto No 2 so different to Chopin's romanticism. I'm not a big fan of Stravinsky or Bartok, but they were there. Also became a huge nerd for French baroque like Marais and Couperin. I bought lots of CD's. Man I cried and cry a lot with this music. But just like that it stopped.\n1. **More hits from the moment era.** With hipsters indie came. I was seen like a geek and a nerd. I didn't care. But just like that some pop, indie, folk, and alike started to be in my favorites. I was looking for other radio stations lime Third rock radio. Intepol, Spoon were showing in my playlist. ***DO YOOU!!***, and just like how music ends, I started to listen less and less *\"classical\"* and being replaced with Dan Deacon, Caifanes (because I'm from Mexico), Kero Kero Bonito, Elvis Depressedly, Grimes, The knife, Coco Rosie to mention some few. I went to my first music festival, Knotfest. I went to my first Roger Waters.\n1. **Shoegaze, Vaporwave, Ambient, Dream pop, retro-wave era.** It's what I'm at the time I'm mostly listening.\n\nNow, the first eras are obviously when I was a kid to a teen. I wasn't very social and my family was my emotional support. Then my late teens and university happen and I didn't change much, I had few friends but I started to learn about me. The last two, is my most social times. I go clubbing, I go to concerts, I have few friends but I have them. There are a lot of things happening in those eras, and I kistened to other things, but let's say most of the time is governed by how I describe them.",

It's also a time where my parents got divorced, and all those songs were breakup songs, and they were all these indiepop songs. \n\nAnyway, I definitely define an era of my life based around the music I was listening to at the time, and it will always remain nostalgic to me and even my family.",

            "I realized this at the beginning of this year, so I made an effort to start tracking it more closely. I have a playlist for every month so far with all the new songs I discover in that month, and all the songs i played on repeat otherwise. It's given me a lot to remember on, especially with how much has happened in the last 3 months.",
            "Definitely, and this is far from weird. These songs trigger feelings associated with those time periods, so they add an extra dimension to your memories. You not only get to relive it in your head, but it will take you back to those feelings as well.",

And I guess the songs also reflects how I felt at that time (mellow, depressed, motivated, hopeful).",

            "Yeah I do this as well. Some songs immediately bring me back to certain times in my life.",
            "There is one song that brings back the memory of loving in my moms apartment right after the divorce, and looking at all the moldy dishes in the sink.\n\nThere is another from around the same time that brings back the memory of my favorite video game at the time, the one I would play for hours on end until I've collected every little thing there was.\n\nThe toy story song \"you've got a friend in me\" reminds me of my childhood pre divorce, I was addicted to that movie, I was buzz lightyear for Halloween every year for like 3 years in a row.\n\nIt also just occured to me how most of my memories are also categorized as either pre, or post divorce. Oh well, who needs therapy anyways.",

            "Not only by the songs or albums (remember chocolate starfish?!?) but also by the medium I was listening with. The discman period, after that there was a mp3 player (the OC time!) and then I had my first iPod \ud83c\udf89\nI'm a lazy person, so it was updated rarely and I knew which song came next all the time.\n\nI found my mp3 player the other days. Zack, 21 again ^^",

            "well about two months ago i had this phase when random memories would just pop up (it was when my gf broke up with me and when i was basically losing touch with people i cared about, so thats probably the reason) from my whole life, and also some songs that i used to listen to, and after a while i was able to make some playlists for basically every two or so years of the past decade, starting with 2013 cause thats about when i started listening to music (im 16 rn)",
            "I do that but with wow expansions.",

            "I don't do this myself, but I know someone who does something similar. One of my friends does this with what food he was eating a lot of at the time. Also as much as I *don't* do this I probably could, my music tastes did change quite a bit and it does somewhat match up with when I went through personal changes",
            "Yes. You are literally the only one. You special little snowlafke.",

            "No",
            "Bakkarali",
            "That\u2019s me too. I can basically time warp and wrap myself in how I felt in each era by listening to a particular group of songs or even one particular song. I have deeply wondered if I was the only one who made strong emotional attachments between songs and life events.",
            "I stole the idea of making a new playlist every birthday and am now on playlist 29. I started at 25 and it contains every song I get obsessed with that year.",
            "You are not alone",
            "No, I do the same thing. I have a little album of the month thing in my head. So when I'm a bit bored I'll go through some of my favourite albums I've listened to and figure out which one had the biggest impact on me. I also do an album of the year. Last year was such a trainwreck for me I refuse to award it an album. But 2018 is was Sunbather by Deafheaven, 2017 was Blond by Frank Ocean, 2016 was Entertainment by Gang of Four so on so forth.",
            "I\u2019m the exact same way. Most songs that I hear conjure up specific moments or situations in my life, both good and bad. For example, when I hear \u201cTomorrow\u201d by Silverchair, it immediately takes me back to 1995 when my grandfather passed away. It was my favorite song at the time (I had just started high school), but this song had nothing to do with my grandfather or our relationship. Completely random.",
            "For the past 3 daya I've been looking up old bands I grew up listening to and falling in love with them all over again. Remding me of when I was more of a kid than I am now. It's weird how you remember songs differently after a while",
            "Shit, I just realized that my biggest era change was from going from a 3-year relationship and listening to swedish pop-rock to single and listening to Radiohead instead. Like, major era change.",
            "Yes, and the best part is when you listen to the songs and remember that good(maybe bad) old times",
            "Theres no need to to ask if you\u2019re the only one, you arent. Just ask about what you want to know",
            "no, of course, you're not the only one. many of my friends do, even I do. and listening to the tracks that I downloaded at that time, I remember those past moments.",

            "Omg yes! I make Spotify playlists based on my current mood. I try to do it monthly because it\u2019s nice to look back and see what music I was listening to (like for example, junior year in college! Best year of my life). It\u2019s also nice to see how my music taste developed.",
            "I do that, but I also mostly divide eras of my life into story arcs like my whole life is a TV show or an anime.",

            "No I do it",
            "I divide by the books that were read and call them chapters.",
            "Are you the only one? No. For me it was seventies disco growing up. New Romantic era in my teens. Indie rock to house music to rave stuff in the late 80s to early 90s. Brit-pop during my first marriage and divorce. \n\nMost people do that. They wouldn't have soundtracks on films that portrayed such a thing if it weren't the case.",
            "My grade matched the year so I was in grade 7 in 1987 for example so me remembering the years of songs comes quite easy if I remember it from school activities.",
            "Oops I did it again",
            "Yes! I do it with smells as well. Like what deodorant or perfume I wore during that time.",
            "Not just songs but media in general. I think of eras by songs, tv shows, movies and video games. \n\nIn addition of course to life events and such.\n\nSongs produce the most nostalgia, though. Certain songs will automatically evoke different memories and times in my life.",
            "For me it's the other way around, I can remember how old a song is, by what version of Sims I was playing at the time. And for my pre-sim days it's what toys I was playing with or friend I was hanging out with.",
            "YES i thought i was the only one",
            "I realised this last year listening to The Miseducation of Lauren Hill taking me back to my first teenage drama.",
            "Yep, I absolutely do this.   So far I have 3 \u2018eras\u2019 for the 3 decades of my life.  I was born in 90 so I have all of the 90s for the first (age 1- 10), the 2000s for the second (age 10-20) and the \u201810s for the third (20-30).  It works out nicely lol.",
            "If you are to hear radio nowadays, goldy oldie stations are playing what current 30s' have heard when they were 10-20, at the peak of their youth. It's a known thing and media aim at it in averaged\\simplified way. I personally do have this age of tastes imprinted deeper than anything past that.",
            "Not just you. The music I listen to has changed a lot as I've aged so it's easier to identify time periods it the emotional state I was in at the time depending on the tunes. For first time in a decade I've got depression under control so I'm listening to a lot of deep house and lovey shit like Home by Edward Sharpe.",

            "yes",
            "You're in good company- I totally do that for each season. It's been almost 10 years since I started and it is pretty cool to go back and reminisce through the playlists.",
            "I have a playlist of over one hundred fifty songs I associate with different times of my life. Each one brings back different and vivid memories and listening to them in order really puts into perspective how much has changed in the last decade alone.",
            "Absolutely. I actually noticed last week that you can see a distinct change from when I was in a relationship to when I suddenly wasn't. Change. It's a helluva thing, lol",
            "Nope, not at all. This is very common. We often attach memories or the general zeitgeist to songs.",

            "I just realized that I do this.",
            "I do this too. Just drove about two hours, listening to songs I listened when I was younger. Some songs reminds me very specific events. Like my heart being broken by the one I loved 15 years ago (Scorpions), or partying with my friends in school (Offsprings), or seeing my awesome dad, who barely could walk because of a Guillain Barr\u00e9, kicking asses of two \\~30 years old creepy guys who were getting way too close of my 14 years old sister (Will Smith).\n\nSongs are, with smells, the strongest thing that bring me in a specific date or period of time.",

            "Can confirm. Everything was cringey about my NSync era",
            "No, you are not alone xD I usually do that. Is like you are your own \"historian\" and create a timeline about your life, with songs being a sort of key point in it.",

            "I've seen it already but Spotify is wonderful for this! Each year is the most played song but I also have one playlist I've been building for a couple years with a collection of my Flavors of the Week (those same five songs you listen to on repeat for a week and get burnt out). I like throwing it on shuffle and be like, what the heck was I thinking?",
            "I do in a way or another, i associate songs and genres to parts of my past, like acdc reminds me off my days in primary school when i was the top talent in singing",
            "Am I the only one who divides the eras of my life by the dog I owned?",
            "Heck yeah! Whenever I think about my life, it gets sorted by the type of music I like at that time like from 3rd to 6th Grade I was into Minecraft songs/parodies then High School came and I was like into Owl City then edgy stuff (T\u00f8P, MCR) with a hint of weebiness and classical music. Present day me is now into Weeb EDM music and Metal.",

            "Oh man when you throw in that burned CD from eighth grade and just sit there in your nostalgia.",
            "I do something really similar. I divide eras of my life by what I was really into at the time. Even in my toddler years, I was obsessed with Veggietales. Then came Star Wars, FNaF, Pokemon, Undertale, Smash Bros, and now, JJBA.",

I'd wager the same thing happens when you're speaking to someone; you'll say something, and only then start to think about it a bit more critically. Obviously, it's much more likely to happen in writing, because that's a much more private activity (until you post, anyway) so you're naturally a lot more... unhindered, if that makes any sense. You'll write and write, read it over, refine, write some more, write less, read it over again... and by then, you've honed down the thought so much that you either answer your own question or begin to see your opinion in a different light.  \n\n\nI'm pretty sure this is a natural process.

And everything in the \"dream\" looked exactly like the room I was in, which had never happened before. \n\nI didn't enter that room for the rest of the visit. I slept under the dining room table.  My treasured doll was in that room and I left it there when we went home.  \n\nStatic really is the worst.  \n\nAlso, while rare, it turns out that I do sometimes experience night terrors. Maybe that was the first one. I never really thought about it until I realize that the only time my dreams put me in the exact spot my physical sleeping self is actually occupying, it's a night terror and some spooky shit is about to go down.  My second night terror made me legit believe I was possessed or haunted, and I was too afraid to tell anyone for *years*, because my childhood environment was not one that evoked trust in adults.",

My lifelong dream of traveling the world never came to fruition for various reasons, so I was delighted to discover Street View a few years ago and see it gradually expand its coverage.  I've spent many happy hours wandering the backroads of distant countries.  I have a large computer monitor to make the most of the experience.   \n\nBut here's the amazing thing I discovered about Street View: if I spend enough time exploring a place by traveling along its roads and panning all around as I go, a kind of false memory forms in my mind whereby my recollection of the \"journey\" feels almost real i.e. as if I'd actually been there.  It's weird.   Doesn't happen just from looking at pictures - something about traveling along a road triggers it.\n\nThe first time this happened was when I had explored a street in my local area where there was a place I was interested in.  A couple of weeks later, a friend suggested we go there for a look and I said I'd already been - because I actually thought I had!   But when I thought about it carefully, I realized I couldn't possibly have been there in real life.  At that moment, the whole world opened up for me.  Well, much of it, anyway - there are still mysterious regions where Google Maps hasn't had much penetration.\n\nPrior to that, when Google Earth first came on the scene, I had been excited about exploring the Earth from above, but was soon disappointed by the poor resolution available in most of the non-urban regions of interest to me.  If Google Earth had anything like the resolution of Street View I'd go wild as I love seeing the world from the air.",

Google Maps was my sanity for those 3 years (I worked there for 5 years but was only moved to the department on my 2nd year). We would check the location on the map and then check the tower it gets pinged to. I spent 7.5 hours of my day travelling on the map, pretending I was \"walking\" on the streets on Sydney. Then I went international. Paris. Rome. New York. It was magical. I still do it today now that I am working from home. I would ocassionally visit our family house on the map on a different city because I haven't been home for almost a year now. Not the same as the real thing, but keeps me hopeful.

I know, logically, they were mining camps or research stations or a cabin. Their isolation freaked me out. I've been up there, and was freaked out at times.

The city is beautiful, and landing there is super complex (won't go into details unless asked), but it's a sight to behold. Feels like you're entering Valhalla whenever you land there.

            "I find comfort in knowing that everyone hates their home town for one reason or another, so even though you wish you could be in Paris for an hour, it\u2019s probably not all that interesting compared to Google Street View, and it would get old quickly living in (insert city here).\n\nAt least that\u2019s my take on travel lol",

Not all \u201cnerds\u201d get bullied or wear their hair in their face. \n\nI went to a large highschool (graduating class of 600 kids) for half of highschool and then a small school for the rest (graduating class of 75 kids) and both were pretty blended.

            "A) it's exagerated to hell and back\n\nB) Prior to 1984, many places had a drinking age of 18.  This led to a lot of HS/college movies being based on the idea that teenagers *can* drink or at least obtain alcohol easily.  Since movies tend to be based as much on other movies as they are on reality, the \"HS Rager\" is kind of a self-perpetuating thing.",
            "Drug and alcohol fuelled debauchery was a semi-common thing in my high school. Parties didnt have tonnes of people though, biggest I ever saw had max 50 people. As for sex, most people who were having sex were only doing so in commited relationships.",
            "I grew up in a party city so big parties with 100+ people were happening every few weeks and at certain times of the year they became way more common... We also had a small trade school in the city that was basically considered a party school so quite often parties could extend from kids in grade 8 all the way through college kids... We also had bush parties and things like that.\n\nSo I guess it depends on where you live. ",

We would find whatever spot we could and have some pretty massive ones, with literally hundreds of people. We partied in fields, houses, barns, whatever. And of course high schoolers are going to find drugs, alcohol, and sex.\n\nSchool itself on the other hand is fairly exaggerated. It was 98% sitting in class, bored out of our minds.

And we are alcohol savages, 10 beers is an easy routine. \nThen during the week-end you can do bigger parties, club, underground places etc it never stops !\nAbout the sex I would say that if you want some, it's not a problem, everybody is drunk/high af all the time..\nHaving the best time of my life in the partying way and I've been living in some good cities like Prague, Berlin.

            "Completely dependent on location and, then, your interests/social groups (not surprisingly).  \n  \nI grew up in a beach town and had a job that would be considered \"cool\", so I was lucky enough to experience lots of wild parties. I was a super nerdy low-income kid all growing up, so I credit the friendships I made at my first job with taking me from \"nothing ever happens\" to developing social skills and checking most of the teen-party-movie tropes off my bingo card.  \n  \nIt was a combination of living somewhere touristy and having a job with close friends where we interacted with the tourists and could invite them to parties.

Had a bunch of people locked up. Had some murdered. \nWhat IS exaggerated to me is how much of a big deal it is in movies and shows and how much they talk about it. It\u2019s really annoying to see conversations dominated by sex and who is having sex and who is drinking and all that nonsense. Nobody cared about that stuff in my high school. It wasn\u2019t a big deal at all. We didn\u2019t have big lectures and the school didn\u2019t go into mourning when someone died. No one noticed if someone got locked up or if someone had a baby. It was all just regular every day stuff for us. \nSo to me, these things are vastly blown out of proportion in movies and shows. \nYeah it happened every day and all over.

The first real party I went to, there were over 75 people there, 10+ fist fights, and 3 vehicles got wrecked. I was the youngest there at 14 and the oldest person was in their 30s. However, I live in a very isolated small town of 3000 people and the party was in the middle of the woods at a giant bonfire. There were multiple parties every weekend, on a Friday/Saturday night if you got bored at one party you could go to another. It was like that for YEARS here until 2 young girls died from drinking and driving. \n\nSo, no we didn't have those rager house parties, but we had them in the woods. The only drugs that were really done was smoking weed. Sex with randos/one night stands, definitely happened. Although... They weren't quite a rando because everybody has known everybody since before pre-K. ",

Worst thing we ever got our hands on was wax, which was unknowingly laced, and that was a wake up call for me. Some of us had fake ID\u2019s and we would drink regularly on weekends, just around a fire, enjoying life. No randoms, everyone at our parties was part of an inner circle friend group and mostly guys. Every now and then we\u2019d have our girlfriends at the parties, so we\u2019d go off and have fun with our girl individually. I guess it was common enough to nickname the guest room of the house to the \u201csex room.\u201d However it\u2019s been a good few months since we\u2019ve properly hung out and I myself have lost the desire to do anything like that anymore.

Weed and acid was the #1 and #2 stuff in my high school. But it was safe to say that half of the school never tried it, and those that used it frequently were a minority.

Smaller parties where usually there was weed, parents weren't ever involved it was usually just when parents went out of town, and there was never a huge amount of people, I had one and there were 5 of us, we went out back, smoked a lot of weed bought with the money my parents left me, and we ordered a few pizzas and that was it.  Where I lived weed was wayyyyyy easier to get than alcohol, unless you knew someone who was over 21 you weren't getting alcohol, in my old highschool I literally had a fuck ton of dealers I could buy from if I needed. \n\nIm not claiming there arent massive parties like the ones from american pie or super bad or whatever, but I can definitely say that I went to a fairly large highschool, I've never heard any crazy stories of parties where friends of friends of friends were showing up getting wasted and having sex in the bedrooms.

I don't know how many times I would be at a bonfire in the woods or drinking at a friend's house and just get borderline blackout plastered. We would routinely have parties of 30+ people. The one thing that I personally hate about high school movies, is the cliques. And the bullies. At my school, of course we had cliques. But it wasn't like you couldn't cross lines. Football dudes were dating the AP chicks and everyone still mingled with everyone. I never understood that in movies where the nerds and the jocks don't mix. Everyone hangout with everyone. Except in the lunchroom. Then the bullying. We had one or two instances of maybe cyber bullying. Which, honestly, never got taken seriously. It was most people's viewpoints that if you didn't like it then stay off the social sites. But irl, not one single bully incident was to be had. Noone ever committed suicide. If there was someone that had the signs of a cutter or depression, people would kind of come together in a nonchalant way to socialize with that person. The football dudes never were stuck up and haughty. If anything they always protected and guided the freshman just coming into the school as a matter of course. They acted normal. Every movie I see about high school just has the socialization of it so fucking wrong. Like, my school wasn't that big. So maybe there are schools like that out there. But I refuse to believe that is the majority of people's experience in high school. And don't get me wrong. We had fights there. We had bad shit go down. But never on the level it was portrayed in these dumbass high school movies. ",

Sometimes there were only 5 of us, other times up to 30. Of course if we could get drunk at a house we would.\n\nI can only think of a handful of times where we had ragers and that mostly came about when everyone and their grans would turn up regardless of if they had been invited or not.

When I say uniform, for example -- there was never \"the goths\" or whatever as some unified group - you might have some people who wore all black and had a cradle of filth hoodie, but it wasn't like they stuck together - you could find them scattered all over different groups of friends. Groups of friends were just groups of friends - you hang out with your closest dozen pals, and that becomes your circle. But your friend group doesn't exactly have a clearly defined, rigid theme or specific mission.    \n  \nPlenty of sports guys also played musical instruments. Plenty of heavy metal loving guitar nerds also wore polo shirts and did not have dyed long black hair. Plenty of videogame nerds weren't either fat or scrawny. And plenty of people in one group were not at all opposed to socializing with people in other groups.  \n  \nAnd things like popularity -- I was in a school with 3500 students. What does \"most popular\" even mean? I'd be amazed if there was even a single person who could accurately claim to have even 100 friends in high school. Sure, there were plenty of people who got along well with most people they encountered, and they could sit down with just about any other student and carry a conversation, but that never translated to \"this person is royalty and everyone's intimidated by how popular and powerful they are\" that you see in movies & TV, it just didn't work that way.  \n  \n",

            "Well I was a quiet bundle of a social anxiety so I didn\u2019t do much. But I definitely know people that went to party\u2019s and did drugs, alcohol and definitely had sex lol. Not hard drugs though, just like weed and that type of stuff\n\nAlso: Washington State, USA",
            "So, it depends.  I personally literally never drank in high school, and the only parties I went to were the type where the true cool kids watched epically terrible movies like Santa Claus Conquers the Martians and Glen or Glenda.\n\nThat said, parties with actual alcohol were something I heard about all the time.  I just A) never got invited to them and B) was never interested in such things in the first place.  To this day, I will avoid a work party if there is heavy drinking involved.",
            "I mean the biggest parties I went to in hs (that wasn't a frat party at the local college) were probably around 30 kids (I can think of one that maybe had 60-70 over the course of the evening but probably not more than 30-40 at any given time).  Most parties were tight-knit groups of maybe 10-20 playing drinking games in the garage, basement, or kitchen if the parents were out of town.  The best parties were always like...8 people of just me and my close friends.  But yeah we drank, and some kids did drugs, and other kids hooked up.  But we were all really responsible - some of us went \"dry\" if we played sports and were in season, and most of us coordinated \"sleepovers\" so we wouldn't have to drive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy freshman year of HS I had a pretty diverse end-of-the-year party of around 30 kids and invited some friends from other schools, members of the marching band, stoner kids, regular kids, sports teams kids, smart kids in honors/APs, etc.  I wasn't at all intending it to be an \"alcoholic\" party (my intention was actually to have a darkly lit dance party and maybe kiss the guy I had a crush on but that never happened) but here's how everything went down.  First, some girl started smoking a cigarette in my backyard.  My parents were suprisingly ok with it since she wasn't inside.  Some of my nerdier friends started freaking out (remember, this is freshman year), so they called their parents to come pick them up.  Other kids called their parents to ask for permission to stay, and they said it was ok.  My parents also were home, and were available to answer any phone calls from concerned parents \"yes, a girl is smoking a cigarette outside.  My daughter doesn't smoke, but we are not going to ban her friend for smoking\" etc. People were so grateful my parents were so chill, and were happy my parents were willing to talk to other parents, because that mean they could stay.\n\nThen this troublemaker kid decided to go into my parent's bar in the basement.  I honestly assumed no one would do that because we were all good, well-behaved kids and it was so obviously something we weren't supposed to touch.  My dad caught wind when he came downstairs at one point to check up on us, pulled me aside, and said \"look, that is OUR very expensive alcohol, they can't just take things without asking.\"  I was shocked that his issue was with the stealing and not with the underage drinking.  So I explained the problem, and someone called someone else and they brought over a couple of cases (and a gatorade bottle full of liquor - probably stolen from their own parent's bar) and that was that.  Instant \"party\" in the true sense of the word. I didn't drink at my party that time (too chicken), but from then on I knew my parents were pretty chill with things and I started drinking at parties later that summer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think the biggest \"party season\" at least for me was always in the summer, and also on breaks in college.  There were a few summers where literally *every single night* there were multiple house parties.  There was always somewhere to go, but my favorites were always the groups of like 8-12 at my house with card games.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh yeah, and kids at my hs drank before football games, and passed out/vomited etc. in front of school officials.  I was never that reckless and only started tailgating senior year.",
            "It depends. I knew people that had older siblings that would get alcohol and drugs for parties and it was pretty much like the movies, if anything it was crazier because the movies tend to be light on teenage sex.\n\nIt happens, but I think it's relatively rare. I think what's really different from the movies is who the kids are that are throwing those parties. In the movies it's always middle class popular kids from \"normal\" homes but everyone I knew that threw parties like that had some pretty fucked up home lives.\n\nWhich makes sense, it's hard to throw huge parties where kids are puking in your hallway and fucking, well, everywhere they can, when you have normal parents that won't tolerate that shit.",
            "I had a very tame experience but that's not to say my classmates weren't partying and doing drugs. Just not my scene, still isn't",
            "I\u2019ve never been to a party that people danced at.",
            "For me, no. I never went to a single party in high school.",
            "Went to maybe 1-2 parties a year from grade 9-12.  But never \"ragers\" like you see in movies.  Usually like 6 to 12 people would be at it. \n\nI was shocked when a rich kid's parents let them throw a huge party for the entire grade for graduation.  There was at least 200 people there (out in the boonies on an acreage).  They had rented portapotties and a dj and set up a dance floor.  Tones of 17 and 18 yr olds drunk grinding while dancing and the mom is going around filming it like it's a toddlers birthday.  Was bizarre",
            "I don\u2019t know about you guys, but I haven\u2019t been to a single party. Hmmm maybe I just don\u2019t get invited... yes that makes more sense. ",
            "Of course it is! You would never see so many people having sexual intercourse with each other in such short windows of time",
            "I think it entirely depends on your city. Where I lived hanging out with class mates was okay but the real fun was just meeting friends of theirs that lived in different parts of town and/or went to different high schools entirely. Each school was maybe only 200-300 students but the total population of the city was around 1 million if your counted surrounding areas. So there were dozens of high schools all over the city and there was tons of networking.\n\nOnce you got into a little subculture like punk, metal etc. you would meet people at their music clubs and hang out with those people and then you could very easily meet people that weren't in high school yet or were in college. \n\nPeople could throw parties sure but plenty of times people still lived at home and if it was summer you could just go outside and hang in a park. People there drank, did drugs, had sex, etc.. There were places you could go in certain parks and on an average friday night in July you'd be looking at anyting from a hundred to a couple of thousand 14-25 year old people partying. People had campfires, barbecuing, playing music, dancing, drinking, doing drugs, making out, playing games, etc. Even if you didn't know anyone you could usually just sit down and offer passers by a beer and you'd make some new friends. Cops would usually show up a few times a night, walk around and see if anyone was violent or pasted out drunk. I remember one time two female cops on horseback came around and people just went up to the officers and started petting the horses and asking questions like what its name was, how long they'd been working, when they started riding and so on. Cops talked to the sober people and decided that things were good and then left.\n\nEven if you were a nerd you could still go to LAN-caf\u00e9s where tons of gaming rigs were set up and you could go there if you ever had a long empty period in you school schedule. One place had a professional Magic: The Gathering scene but also hosted free casual legacy tournaments so you could build a really cheap deck, and suddenly you had a place to go to once a day every week and meet new people. Sine it was a casual tournament, the people that took the game seriously mostly saw it as a way to practice so they didn't give you shit for not knowing the game well or played competitively.\n\nAnd even if you didn't like doing those things you could still talk to people on MSN. Back then when someone was online on an IM chat service, it meant that they were sitting by their computer. They weren't running around in the world doing shit so you weren't really interrupting their normal life. If they were busy they'd just log off or temporarily block you if you were being annoying at that particular day.",
            "I did happen to go to a high school where those things did occur, and frequently. Honestly I partied harder in HS than in college. Project X tho is too exaggerated, however this one kid came close...\n&nbsp; \n\nin the hour it went down before the cops came, his fathers 10k watch and multiple bottles of expensive champagne were stolen. I watched people punch holes in walls and even push over the 7ft wood fence running from cops. There were well over 100 people there. tbh, shitty party. ",
            "In my experience, some aspects seemed ridiculous and others seemed about right. \n\nGrowing up in a white town in the suburbs made partying hard since most of the time, parents don't want to have a high school amount of kids in their basement (which are also hard to find in my town making partying even harder due to noise) drinking like its the end of the world. Most nights if we wanted to drink we'd end up at a park but eventually public safety would show up, tell everyone to go home and then everyone would walk in separate directions to their house.\n\nBut senior year, a lot changed. I think there were a few house parties I got into but a majority of them stayed outside. But senior cut day was an insane rage- in the morning kids day drank at the beach until 1. Then a girl had a house party until around 7 with a slip and slide and lots of beer (assuming all the adults in surrounding houses were at work or didn't care since it wasn't night time because no cops were called despite the noise). At night we went to the carnival since it was in town- most kids done drinking for the day moving on to smoking.\n\nThen the night took a turn and a kid from my high school got jumped from two kids from a rival school. To this day I don't really understand why this kid got jumped and stabbed in the process but it triggered 3 huge fights in the next 3 days. In the process of these 3 days kids got stabbed, hit on the head with pipes, windshields were smashed in etc. etc. When we returned to school we lost our senior privileges (leaving the school during off periods/ having ninth period off) since there were fears of us leaving the school and getting jumped by a rival waiting outside. The fight was never resolved and ended once schools took away senior privileges\n\nI know the towns around me are a little richer and kids in those high schools have overdosed in the bathroom which would never have happened in my high school, so I guess location really does make or break high school partying. ",
            "They don\u2019t seem far-fetched to me, except the live bands. There were no live bands at high school parties I went to, bc no one in high school was confident enough to put themselves out there like that in front of his/her peers that way. Certainly not a whole group of someones. There were live bands at college parties though. I always seemed to know musicians in college. \n\nAnd teen movies make it seem like someone is having a huge party with 100+ kids every weekend, but that wasn\u2019t my experience. We only had huge parties with 100+ kids on certain occasions, like end of the school year, or Halloween or whatnot, it wasn\u2019t all the time. \n\nMost of us also didn\u2019t have sex with randos in high school. (It was ok in college.) We paired up and had sex with bf/gf and pretended not to, but the people who hooked up with randos were sluts and considered outcasts, so no one did much of that at my school. Might be a result of where I grew up in the Bible Belt though, and the time (90s). \n\nOther than that, they don\u2019t seem far-fetched to me. I drank and partied every weekend from age 14 on. Usually a group of 10-20 of us. I don\u2019t know where everyone\u2019s parents were. Seemed like at least 5 people had parents who were away from the house every single night. It was a hell of a time.",
            "Mine was pretty wild to be honest. I partied quite a bit and barely got through my classes. My parents weren't too strict as long as I got my shit done so I was out a lot and experimented with a lot of different drugs. Not many 17 year olds get to do opium lol.  I also worked my ass off though and had my own money. My first job was at 14 1/2 and I never stopped working from then on, just got different jobs throughout the years so to me, my partying was justified. I do wish I had been better looking back on it but there were always parties and things going on. I did graduate though and was fairly well in all my classes other than math. ",
            "I definitely find the whole cliques element exaggerated.  We didn\u2019t have roving packs of teenagers that hated each other and made fun of each other.  Hell we rarely even had fights.  The drama club kids all went to Homecoming and the Prom and the football kids all went to the school plays.  It was boring as hell but nobody got hurt, so I think reality was way better.",
            "There was a cabin or something in the woods where the cool kids would party and drink. I was the boring type, so I don't know specifics. But one party got \"raided\" by the cops and everyone scattered. One girl fell and broke her leg in two places. Everyone left her on the ground to be found by the cops. I could see that being a scene in a teen movie. Especially with the groin to toe cast she was in for at least a month.",

            "In Bosnia, in my school of course, the most popular girls are either (for lack of a better word) thots or they're intelligent and good at social skills. Luckily most popular girls you'll find are intelligent.\nAs for the boys, the American stereotype of a \"jock\" literally does not exist.\nI have never met a \"jock\" or an annoying psychophat rich hot girl, in any school.\n\nThe most popular guys are popular because they have good social skills and they're good with everyone.\nFor guys, looks don't matter, personality does (at least popularity wise).\n\nBullying practically doesn't exist in my school (can't make the same claim for other schools).\n\nThe school is very effective in enforcing order, only a crazy student doesn't care about his grades and crazy students get easily kicked out.\nMy school mainly punishes with bad grades but overall, its rarely needed.",
            "There were a few parties at my school but only popular kids got invited. As for cliques, those were impossible to infiltrate, but it wasn\u2019t like the whole football team was a clique. A few guys in football, maybe one baseball, some in hockey, etc., and then some stoners made up cliques of guys. Girl cliques were based on the types of guys they were friends with (for jocks) and otherwise if they did art or theatre. ",
            "Lots of big parties during HS. Lived in NYC so there were an endless number of people who would show up. Almost always got broken up by cops because neighbors are too close. Lots of drugs and alcohol. Went to bars regularly. Exstacy was easier to get than beer... but that wasnt hard either. Some people were having lots of sex but many were not. Feels like places where you can get drunk or high kids do that. Where you cant, kids get pregnant and STDs. ",

            "So I went to an ultra exclusive private school in Manhattan. Its one of the schools they base things like Gossip Girl on. I wasn\u2019t a rich kid, but most of the kids were.

Its always amazing to me when people think kids in the ghetto schools are the onea doing drugs, nah, its the kids in the $50k a year k-12 schools who can afford an ounce of blow that do that shit.

Since public drinking is allowed an the drinking age is as low as 16, everybody drinks on the weekends (and some even during the week). We often meet up in parks and have huge drinking game tournaments (we just had one which was a tournament where 32 schools participated). We also do some funny things like \"Ringbahnsaufen\". The \"Ringbahn\" is a commuter train (not sure about the translation) which goes in a circle with 27 stations and often groups of people just sit in the drink with their friends and go one or two rounds in it. People hook up casually and it's not a big thing over here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",
            "So I went to a high school where kids were just rolling in money, like ridiculous amounts of money.

I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, I didn\u2019t really pay attention to anything. I notice all the teachers are on edge, there\u2019s a bunch of people I don\u2019t know. Cars parked out front, and around the campus. This goes on for a long time. I didn\u2019t notice when it stopped,\n\nSo about two weeks ago, I was hanging out with a friend of mine who went to the same high school.

Those were under cover cops. \n\nSo it turns out this kids parents were still living in China, and had bought him a house to live in while going to school. I guess over the summer he got into it with the triads and those were under cover cops and police cars.  They threatened to find him and kill him.

It\u2019s like we were all trying to imitate what we say on TV. We had no idea what life was like, so we followed the only examples we had.",
            "What Hollywood gets wrong about high school is how stupid and inexperienced the kids are. The scripts are written by adults and they can't remember how dumb and childlike they actually were in high school. So Hollywood ends up making high schoolers seem like adults when they're really just children that probably couldn't fend for themselves let alone hatch plans worthy of a movie."
