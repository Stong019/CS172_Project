If you make every decision based on how much money someone has, why do you buy anything from companies that are already successful and have billions of dollars? Why do you use social media when the people who own them are millionaires?

Them being \u201cmillionaires\u201d doesn\u2019t matter to me because it is still a transaction that is bent to my favor even after paying a few dollars a month, in comparison to the free entertainment that is accessible to everyone.

Dude made thousands every stream. But he didn't have sponsors his only income was donations.\n\nStreamers like Ninja i guess. He's the best example i can think of, he has sponsors so he doesn't necessarily need the donations. But the donations do help.\nMost people donate for the small amount of attention they will get. Other donate because they still genuinely want to donate to the individual. It qll really depends on what the individual thinks when they choose to donate.\nWhen I donate, it was to support my favorite streamers. Even if they already make so much, I still like to donate as a form of \"thanks\" Clint Stevens and Etika literally got me through my darkest times so the least i can do is donate to show my appreciation.",

            "Honestly? Sucked into the belief that they're \"friends\" with the streamer. \n\nI mean, there are genuinely normal people that donate because they want the attention on their username or because they generally want to support people whose work they enjoy. But the vast majority of denotations from bigger streamers and whatnot? It's because they think they're friends with the streamers or that they will be friends with the streamers. Some clear examples would be both PewDiePie and the Game Grumps. There are other examples 100% but these two are ones I can easily focus on because...\n\nThey both have names for their fans. They're not just called \"the fans\" they're called \"the lovlies\" or \"the bro army\" (might not be called that anymore, I know he used to do that shtick when he was exploding into popularity). So see, you're not just some fan. You're part of the group. You know? You're IN. Donate a bit of money and get your name on screen. Game grumps are way more notorious for it for sure, but other streamers do it too when they have streams or videos where their friends are in it too. So if YOU donate some money and say something really funny, sweet, or cool, maybe they'll want to be your friend and you can be more than a lovely, you can be part of the group. You can be the guy who Arin invites over to \"set up a server\" for the \"first br game ever on the dendy\" or you can BE the guy at the end of \"ode to Dan\" who the camera pans to when Arin says \"who am I going to play video games with all day?\" \n\nI don't mean to attack the grumps so much. It's not just them, most of the bigger streamers do things like this. Asmongold who streams wow sometimes treats people who watch his streams like shit. But on the other hand, he has guilds for them and will hang out with them and run dungeons with them. Think about all those guys who run raids with Asmon who never roll on anything huge and let him have it. They aren't doing it because they're nice or because they just standup guys. They do it because \"they're in\" they're part of \"the group\" now. They give him the rare drops because if they don't, they'll be kicked out of the \"group\". \n\nImaqtpie did it. Guardsmanbob did it. xqc does it. ninja does it. You want to know the people that DON'T prey on their audience to get donations? People who don't stream much anymore because they aren't making bank from their vict- viewers. That's why \"girl streamers\" make the \"omigoooood\" noises squeels and bounce in their chairs. It's why they wear low cut tops and talk about how thicc they are (poki you're not thicc) or do semi lewd acts for attention. It's all about making money. The popular and successful ones are on that shit. It's marketing genius. Pewdiepie made a killing on \"befriending\" his fanbase and turning them into an army. They were \"part\" of something. They were \"in\" the group. They didn't feel like a fool when they donated because tons of people donate. They're \"in\" too.",

            "Because you like their content and they provide that content because it's their job and they make money.\n\nIt's the same question as \"why do you buy albums and merch from bands that you love?\" but because it's a \"donation\" people get confused and go full armchair psychologist.\n\nIt's called being a \"patron of the arts\" and art is not only for rich people.\n\nIf you stop supporting those who entertain you because they are successful they won't stick around to entertain you anymore.",

Plus it doesnt matter how many people watch if no one donates. The counter argument would be \"well they still get sponsored, brand deals, and run ads\" but if youre in the mindset to donate even 5 dollars youre definitely not going to buy a 50 dollar product that theyre sponsoring. \n\nBut at the end of the day, if someone is in a financial pickle they shouldnt donate if theyre not able to.",

True the content is free but it wouldn't exist if nobody donated or subscribed. If a streamer has provided you with hours upon hours of entertainment, fun or education; it's fair to give a little in return. Note though a lot of times it's not just a streamer running the show, they got mods, editors, etc too to pay.  \n\nIn my opinion, patreon or streams are a better way of payment for the consumer than paywalls.",

Sure, having a little extra money helps whenever you want to support them since you don't want to give them your rent money lol but give or take I probably give about 100 to $200 whether that's on merch stream donations or patreon. I mostly do it because I love being able 2 to show my appreciation that I have for them. \nSure by just watching their streams I skin support them however I want to do a little bit more just because I'm able to and also because I feel like they deserve it. It's not easy being a streamer or being an entertainer online to the point where people decide they want to support you financially and get you to that millionaire status... Out of all the streamers there are in the world only a very few handful get to be at that top spot and it all depends on the person actually whether or not the audience can connect and click with them.\nsure you can say that it's so easy by playing video games and stuff like that but I don't really watch them for their skills and video games he'll some of the people that I watch and support are terrible at playing some of the games that they decide to play but it's when they make me laugh by the way that they are the way that they communicate by talking about themselves and making the effort to express how they really are.\nTLDR I want to show my appreciation by giving them a lil money because it's not easy being an entertainer.",

            "It's not like every single time you give away money is because you actually need to buy something or out of charity, sometimes the reason is just entertainment. So, from a \"objective\" point of view it's no different than paying money to see a movie at a cinema. Just thought of this example randomly, but if you think about it in both cases you're giving money to people who are already millionaires to watch them performing on a screen, the difference may be in WHAT you're watching and it's quality, but everyone need to shut down their brain once in a while and see some stupid shit, even \"elitarian\" cinephiles. \n\nNow from a \"subjective\" point of view... Well, I find it stupid. But again, no one would judge you if you spend your moneys to see a stupid film, we tend to judge who does it because it APPEARS unusual, but it actually really isn't. I think of it just as another of the consequences of everyone having the internet in their hands: same shit as always but slightly different. Innovation I'd say, or maybe evolution?",

            "Happened to me, but much better outcome. This happened back in '92. \n\nI was riding in my cousin's modified VW bug coming back from a night out in  Miami Beach. We saw a friend in his car and my cousin rev-bombed him as we passed. The bug had a tendency to backfire when he did that. We screamed a few profanities at each other between the vehicles and the proceeded to head home on the highway. \n\nAbout 20 minutes later my cousin, looking in his rear view mirror, says \"Oh shit, that's a lot of cops.\" I turn around and see about 10 Miami Dade PD and Florida Highway Patrol cars a good 1/4 mile or so away. I think that they's some car chase or something until they pull up behind us and proceed to felony stop us. They block the 6 lane highway, open their doors and draw their weapons. Over the megaphone we hear **\"DRIVER! OPEN THE CAR DOOR AND STEP OUT OF THE VEHICLE WITH YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HEAD!!\"** So my cousin does this and then they make him lay down on the street a few feet from the back of the car. \n\nI'm anticipating my turn, so I steel myself. Here it comes. **\"DRIVER! STEP OUT OF THE VEHICLE WITH YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HEAD!!\"** What the fuck? I'm not the driver. I'm the passenger. Do I get out and risk something or wait? I want to scream out the window that I'm the passenger, but I'm shitting bricks. More insistent, the cop screams over the megaphone: ***\"DRIVER! STEP OUT OF THE VEHICLE WITH YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HEAD!!\"*** The first time watching Super Troopers when the stoned kids get pulled over and he's screaming \"I can't pull over any further.\" I knew how he felt.\n\nNow the cops are pissed and I'm starting to sweat. ***\"DRIVER! STEP OUT OF THE VEHI...\"*** There's a long pause. Then :\"***PASSENGER, STEP OUT OF THE VEHICLE AND PUT YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HEAD.\"*** A wave of relief washes over me as I open the car door and do as instructed. I lay down on the wet street and get a shoe on my neck as I get patted down and asked if there are any weapons in the car. After a few tense moments we're instructed to stand up and we get a stern lecture about modifying the exhaust on a car because the backfires sounded like gunshots and someone called 911 on us. A few miles back they caught up with our other friend and they proceeded to do the same to him.\n\nTL;DR: They let the rookie scream at us over the megaphone and he fucked it up.",

You are drunk, and the officer is more than likely aware of that fact. You are crying, scared shitless, and attempting to comply with every command thrown at you, just to survive. You do what is asked of you. You get shot...five times, and die. \n\nOh, sorry, did I say that we needed a Devil\u2019s Advocate to help us critically think about the situation? Turns out, it wouldn\u2019t have mattered. The officer was going to kill him either way, no need to artificially change the perspective as a \u2018Devil\u2019s Advocate\u2019 to see it from another point of view: the officer\u2019s decision was premeditated. Can\u2019t really have a Devil\u2019s Advocate if the situation was already written in stone. \n\nEvidence of Premeditated Murder:\n\n1.\tOfficer was shouting commands that both parties knew were impossible to follow verbatim. \n2.\tOfficer was using a weapon with the words \u2018You\u2019re Fucked\u2019 inscribed into it.

Lie down with your hands out. Those are the only commands required, especially to a drunk individual that may not be able to follow directions perfectly. \n4.\tThe officer shot the victim. Five. Fucking. Times. Once would be enough to end his life, or at the very least stop him from attempting to harm the officer (which he clearly wasn\u2019t). Five times means the officer had already decided to kill him, and that he wanted the death guaranteed. Again, an officer\u2019s job ISN\u2019T to guarantee someone\u2019s death. \n\nIf I were the officer\u2019s judge, I would put an entire week\u2019s worth of reading into the laws, and when I was finished, I would have applied every single law and convicted him to the maximum penalty of the law, and hope that he dies in prison for breaking an already shaky trust the citizens have in the police. \n\n",

            "There is no particular set of things you can do.\n\nThe advice to lay down with arms out, face down, is the best.  Given how things are, you could still get shot.\n\nI suppose you could say, \u201cI\u2019m a security officer!\u201d  Or \u201cI\u2019m a fireman!\u201d  \u201cI\u2019m a soldier in the US Army!\u201d  Or some other thing they could possibly respect enough to hesitate, depending on your age or circumstances.   Lying to a police officer is better than being dead.   You could try saying, \u201cI\u2019m the mayor\u2019s son!\u201d  Or quickly and loudly claim to have some major disease or illness.   \n\nBut these things go down so quickly and apparently the police are so damn jittery these days (and \u201cprotect and serve\u201d is no longer in the front of their minds).\n\nInstant cooperation (hands way up in the air, facing the officer, not moving) is probably the first step.  For many of us, these encounters will happen in the car.  Hands on wheel if you\u2019re the driver, no reaching for anything until the officer asks (even if he\u2019s still in his car), then explaining exactly what you\u2019re doing.  Keep your registration and insurance papers outside of any compartment, keep them on your visor and explain that to the police before you reach.\n\nIn CERT training, they taught us to explain to each other what we were doing in several tense circumstances (we were practicing putting out fires).  Police are very used to that.  \u201cI\u2019m going to move my right hand to the visor to give you my registration.\u201d  \u201cMy driver\u2019s license is in my wallet, I\u2019m going to reach into my back pocket.\u201d  Maybe have a photocopy of the license on your visor and explain that.

Ultimately they are looking for compliance and their own safety. If you remove any possible threat (which the above does) it should de-escalate the situation.\n\nThe only exception is if you can identify who is actually in charge if there are multiple officers and follow their commands exactly.

He asked you and your gave an answer, but when it came time to reciprocate he didn't. Would definitely watch out, because now he knows how much you and he both make, and you know only your side which if he chooses to take advantage of it gives him an in to manipulate you. For example you could find yourself paying for more things and the excuse is always you make more and he has no money, but in reality he could make plenty and just says that to keep his money just for him while you essentially subsidize for the expenses he would or should be paying out of his own money.",

So I guess the answer is yes, people do actually do this. I understand people's reasoning for it, and I get why a lot of people dislike spam calls so much. I think I'm just used to getting calls from numbers I've never seen before due to work, so I've learned to live with the occasional spam call.

Because we have technology to recreate a person's voice, saying little or nothing at all is best. This is important due to the nature of calling various entity's, having a user's voice, and pretending to be them. This can get a person's: social security number, health information, etc. \n\n3.

When you are lying in bed preparing for sleep your brain is not functioning as it normally does. Instead it is in a transitional mode between sleep and awake that can be associated with high levels of mental clarity. Something about having the lucidity of wakefulness combined with the creativity and mental fluidity of a dream state allows for these detailed plans to spring up.\n\nI wish I could elaborate more on this, I read an article discussing this phenomenon but I can't recall where and my googling is not providing.",
            "It's easy to plan. It's tough to act.\n\nAt the end of our days when all of our activities have been put away and it's time to sleep, it's very easy to reflect on the day/week/year we had and think of all the things that are \"wrong\". We wish we could solve those wrong things, and start to think about how that could be accomplished. Most of the time, we don't write any of it down (because that would take effort, and we're probably supposed to be sleeping).\n\nWhen we wake up the next day, the routine takes over. The ethereal plans we had the night before seem less important than what needs to be done right now, or too difficult to start on.\n\nFor actual change, record the changes you wish to make and the plans necessary to take them. If these are personal changes (like maybe eating less and exercising more), tell other people about them to help keep yourself accountable. Make concrete actionable plans. Don't just say, \"I will eat less,\" think about what snack you want to cut out or how you will control your portion sizes. Don't just say, \"I will exercise more,\" think about what exercise you want to do and when to fit it into your schedule.\n\nIf it's a big task, something like turning a storage room into a guest bedroom, break it up into small actionable steps like, \"sort storage items into keep and donate piles\", \"donate the 'donate' items\", \"find new storage for 'keep' items\", \"choose paint color\", \"buy paint,\" etc. Once you've got it into steps, focus only on the next step. It'll make the overall task easier for your brain to handle.\n\nThe end of the day is a good time to make these plans, but only if you actually write them down and make them actionable. Think about how to make it easier for you to do them in the morning. Take advantage of momentum, and try to get at least one thing done from your to-do list after you get home from work or after some other task before you sit down and relax. One you relax it'll be harder to get yourself up and productive again.",

            "\"Here's the truth: People, even regular people, are never just any one person with one set of attributes. It's not that simple. We're all at the mercy of the limbic system, clouds of electricity drifting through the brain. Every man is broken into twenty-four-hour fractions, and then again within those twenty-four hours. It's a daily pantomime, one man yielding control to the next: a backstage crowded with old hacks clamoring for their turn in the spotlight. Every week, every day. The angry man hands the baton over to the sulking man, and in turn to the sex addict, the introvert, the conversationalist. Every man is a mob, a chain gang of idiots.\n\nThis is the tragedy of life. Because for a few minutes of every day, every man becomes a genius. Moments of clarity, insight, whatever you want to call them. The clouds part, the planets get in a neat little line, and everything becomes obvious. I should quit smoking, maybe, or here's how I could make a fast million, or such and such is the key to eternal happiness. That's the miserable truth. For a few moments, the secrets of the universe are opened to us. Life is a cheap parlor trick. \n\nBut then the genius, the savant, has to hand over the controls to the next guy down the pike, most likely the guy who just wants to eat potato chips, and insight and brilliance and salvation are all entrusted to a moron or a hedonist or a narcoleptic. \n\nThe only way out of this mess, of course, is to take steps to ensure that you control the idiots that you become. To take your chain gang, hand in hand, and lead them. The best way to do this is with a list.\"\n\n\\-Jonathan Nolan",

            "There are a lot of great answers in this thread, but most of them discuss the conceptual side of the equation. There is also a physical side: the Biochemistry; particularly of sleep and waking.\n\nIn the morning, your energies are lowest. Your body temperature is low, your metabolism is slowed (you haven't eaten in 8 hours), and your brain has been cleaning itself and not producing neurochemicals for thinking. This is why waking up can take a while, even for the best of us. During this time the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for forecasting thoughts, \"meta\" thinking aka getting your life together, etc is all still \"booting up\".\n\nMiddle of the day is \"true tired\", that feeling of, I could seriously sleep right now. Maybe it's after eating lunch and your digestion is taking the energy from your brain, or maybe it's that daily slump in your circadian rhythm.\n\nAnd then comes the end of the day, although you may seem more tired, you are running on some different biochemistry. For instance, Endorphins and Adrenaline keep you awake, going, thinking, moving. You are \"primed\" at this point. \n\nAt the end of the day, you can finally let your mind wander, giving yourself permission to no longer feel responsible to execute plans immediately. It's in this time that while wandering, you start thinking of what needs to change. With your current biochemical state, you may be feeling pretty inspired, with endorphins to make you feel good about your ideas, and dopamine to think about how you could start them. But of course you're too tired or it's too late to start them now.\n\nThe secret here though is to go ahead and do something to get yourself started in the right direction for the next day. Make it easier on yourself to overcome the hump tomorrow, by doing what you have the energy for now. It might be setting something out on your desk, writing an idea down, maybe setting a to-do reminder, or even just laying there and imagining yourself doing the thing tomorrow and seeing yourself in the process of doing it. These things can make a real difference on your motivation tomorrow, you'll be more willing to actually work on it because you've already started! That's sometimes the hardest part.\n\nHope this helps someone out there.",

I want to plan my fun FIRST. Ok here it goes.... By 8:30pm I want to be on the couch, Netflix on and I want to see the Sully movie which I've been wanting to see for so long. That's it!\n\nYou will not believe how much of a motivation this will be for you. I tried it and WOW! I had the house cleaned, dinner cooked, I was shaved, showered, chores done, plants watered, odd jobs complete, I even did some push ups and called a few friends. WAS DONE WITH EVERYTHING BY 8:15!!!!!! I CRACKED THE FUCKING CODE MAN!!!!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL:DR - Planning your fun first will motivate you to do the other stuff.",

            "I get this all the time. For me its a combination of 1) self virtue signalling and 2) physiological activity. 1) Saying something is easy, doing it is hard. When I say I will do something which I can't do immediately it sparks a fire in me but, obviously the fire burns out when I wake up. This feeling of inspiration, which feels nice, is not as good as feeling of accomplishment but it is damn sure easier to feel inspired than it is to feel accomplished. Habit then has my body accustomed to quick rewards. 2) My brain is generally more active at night and is when I get the good ideas. When I wake up, I'm pretty much dead to the world if I ever get out of bed. To overcome this I try to set a routine in the morning (shower, clean room, breakfast) so my body is not so shocked when I wake up. Then at night I try to meditate to calm my mind. \n\nI haven't quite decided yet if it is better to plan your day the night before or in the morning when you wake up. If I plan it at night then I might stress about it and never get rest. But if I leave it until the morning it may never get done as a struggle to find motivation to get out of bed. Sometimes you have to be a slave driver to yourself but that feeling of accomplishment is worth it.",

I remember two guys from Germany asking about dishes and we loved it. We brought them all kinds of free stuff so we they could try them. It\u2019s not weird at all to ask about your food.",

            "If the waiter pulled a chair out and explained the dishes to you because you asked a question then your friends are the problem. You probably made that persons day finding interest in what he knows. Allot of foreign people I\u2019ve met are actually happy to explain and teach their cultural traditions and dishes to Americans that ask.",
            "Awh yes the solution to ignorance is pretend you understand and not actually learn from those steeped I the culture.",
            "Sounds to me like the waiter was very pleased to have someone ask questions rather than say order random items then complain they weren't what they were hoping for. I've definitely seen that happen a lot in ethnic restos.  Your friends are in the wrong and you need better friends.",

            "Ask and learn. That is the quickest way to end ignorance. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with learning about another's culture.  It's how we diversify our knowledge and not be insular pricks that only thrive in a specific bubble of humanity.\nAnyone who tells you otherwise probably is also the type to scream cultural appropriation at the slightest inclination.\nThose are the first people to distance yourself from. They exude and encourage the very ignorance they chide you for and are undeserving of your presence.",
            "Your friends only got angry because they wanted to pretend to be cultured, and you asking questions shattered that illusion. The waiter didn't need to pull up a chair and talk to you, I imagine they did because they wanted to and were happy to talk to you (and get a break off their feet). What you did was completely fine, your friends need to get off their high horse",

            "You were ignorant, but now you're not. That's how you learn! But you shouldn't feel bad about that at all. Better to ask than pretend like you know anything only to regret it later. \n\nWhen I lived in Vietnam I did just that and I ended up with a massive plate of chicken feet. Never again.",
            "I'm European, went the other day to a Yemeni restaurant with my partner. \n\nI didn't know half of the things, so I asked the guy what was X and Y. (Built to order meal) and it was delicious. \n\nIt's never wrong or bad to want to know about other culture dishes/food.",

            "It is ignorant but being ignorant doesn't make an asshole you just don't know what you don't know..It's okay to ask. didn't sound like the guy was bothered by it and most people are socially intelligent enough to know when someone is asking a genuine question and when their culture is being mocked they don't need your friends to be offended on their behalf sounds like your friends may have some white savior complex. it's alright to ask but also understand it's not the other persons responsibility to educate you on there culture so if you do ask and they kind of brush it off or seem annoyed just leave it they don't owe you that and educate yourself on it.",

Im a pretty young looking 26 yo and got the police called on me for swinging at a park when i was really feeling mentally drained.

I chased my 5 year old and she darted down a tube at warp speed crawl. I got stuck and spend 5 mins untangling myself to get through. My knees hurt from slowly inching through those tubes a dozen time , my back hurts so bad I can't sleep ( from ducking down to avoid bars set for under 5ft tall humans) I got stuck in the curly slide twice, hurt myself a couple times in the foam pit because it's meant for kids 50 lbs not 145.\n\n\nThis stuff just isn't our height or weight. Now of they made this stuff with full grown adult clearance, it wouldn't be so bad. But my ass doesn't fit a 4 inch swing.",

Parent of a wild 3 year old. \n\nYou better believe I'm scrambling up and down trees, in and out of forts and just yesterday jumping into puddles hard enough to make sure water gets in our boots. I'm on the swings and slides too. Every so often I'll scare the crap out of another parent who finds me curled up inside of something playing hide and seek LoL.  Heck, I'll even chase my dog up snow banks and we'll jump off together, it's not just kids who like to play. \n\nAs my kids grow up, I fully intend on playing with them until they don't want to play with me anymore. Being a parent lets me play like I'm a kid again and I love it. I CANNOT wait for super soaker water guns to be age appropriate. \n\nReasons why people don't do this? It's exhausting. Kids don't have quit in them.. it's also not easy on your body, that's what yoga is for though. Also.... I get lots and lots of weird looks and comments from other parents. Mostly mom's I find... but they're no fun anyways so screw em.",
            "Dude, I'm 66 and you jjust described me to a T - with the exception of the part about puking.\n\nMany adults play plenty. They just can afford more expensive toys like boats, motorcycles, atvs, camping equipment, hunting and fishing gear, etc.....",

            "I have a personal theory that when we become adults we face a societal pressure to put aside such \u2018childish\u2019 things and act all dignified and, frankly, boring. I love splashing in puddles, if it snowed I\u2019d be throwing snowballs around, the only reason I didn\u2019t totally go nuts at muddy festivals was because I was still new to the festival thing and was trying to stay relatively clean as I\u2019d didn\u2019t always have access to a washing machine after every festival. \n\nIf I was fit and healthy, I would totally be doing parkour and tree climbing. I love dancing (proper dancing, not random swaying too the beat or the gothic two-step), and generally indulging my inner child. Adults take life way too seriously. I once walked across the bridge at Niagara Falls, got to the line between countries, and as a 28 year old woman on my own, kept jumping back and forth across the line, doing that \u2018one foot in one country, one foot in the other\u2019, etc. People on the cars beside me were laughing their asses off. It was great.\n\nFeed that inner child, OP! Screw the judgemental and boring people who are so concerned about what strangers think of them. Climb those trees, swing on those park swings (they\u2019re so much fun, aren\u2019t they?!), and spin til you puke.\n\nETA: thank you so much for the award! Seriously, my inner child is always so pleased when I get a Reddit award. Maybe it\u2019s cause I never won any trophies as a kid. But I\u2019m getting them now, so thank you!! And may your inner child live a long, healthy and happy life!! Much love to all.",

            "Yeah, I'm 74 and I need to be climbing a fucking tree. \nHere's why I don't: when I was 12, I climbed trees, barns, anything. I loved to climb. I fell 35 ft out of a tree and sprained my ankle and 2 days later I was back in that tree. \nNow if I fall 35 ft., you think I'll just sprain my ankle? Or do you think I'll break my leg, hip, arm or something else? \n As we age, no matter how physically fit we are, shit's going to break easier and recovery time is much longer, and the older we are, some things will never heal right. \nI like being able to get up on my own, walk my 3 miles, do some outdoor exercise, then go fishing, or go to store or whatever.  So no, I'm not going to be climbing any trees soon.",

Just going out and being a goofball sounds fun. \n\nMy next door neighbors have like 5 kids that always play in their front yard. We're all pretty friendly. Shortly after Christmas they got this cool laser tag set that they were playing with outside. I thought 'damn that looks fun, I'm gonna ask to play\". Then I thought \"ehh, people may get the wrong idea\".\n\nIt's unfortunate, but that's the reality. That's why I like adult oriented adventure parks and barcades",

Those splash pads cities have going in the summers are my favorite. I don't climb trees though, I stink at it. I am the absolute favorite adult of my niece's and kids of friends because I will still play with them. I refuse to accept these things as behaviors that should end at a point in your life.

            "Honestly the only reason I don't is because where I'm from there are signs saying anyone over 12 isn't allowed and police will actually tell you to leave if you get caught. I've never seen a playground without one. Parents are allowed, so sometimes I steal my baby cousin for the day and \"help\" him play on the playground.",
            "Holy crap, this!! I\u2019m a 36 year old male, and I love play time. Go karts, bowling, arcades, mini golf etc. but one of the most depressing things about becoming an adult make that no one ever tells you as a kid is there will come a day that you\u2019re no longer allowed to just go to the playground anymore. I mean, I get it. But can we please get play sets in the park for grownups? I wanna get on the swing set!",

In either scenario, I can't really stop to climb a tree or play on a playground.\n\nThat said, I find my \"play\" in other ways.  I joined an aerial sling class last fall and it's been an absolute blast.  I bike sometimes.  I play video games.  I paint.\n\nThere are plenty of ways to play and I encourage everyone to find which ones make them happy.",

            "An additional answer to your question: adults and children find different things stimulating. Running around screaming can be a blast for a kid but would do nothing for an adult (it would have no \"point\").\n\nMany adult activities are oriented around challenges, scoring points, overcoming high scores; or analysis, intellectual stimulation, etc.\n\nA question was asked a while ago about why kids caj watch the same thing over and over whereas (most) adults don't, and one of the answers talked about how adults like to analyse things they watch and critique them; or they need to feel like they were stimulated intellectually (i.e. with a good plot), whereas kids are fine with just the energy of the thing.\n\nI cannot provide any sources for anything I just said (sorry), but perhaps Googling around may point you towards more scientific information about this (as scientific as psych. can be, anyway)",

What can I not do towards others?\n\nWhen you become an adult, you have most likely socialized, and therefore play is no longer neccesary.\n\nOf course, adults still play, but in ways that are mostly about entertainment rather than learning; and in ways that are more virtual rather than physical.\n\nAs an interesting side note: people who didn't get to experience play as children are much more likely to engage in asocial and criminal behaviour as adults.",

Some professors will require the newest version of every book, however others will recommend you buy the previous version for cheaper as it largely contains all the same materials. Also due to the high cost of textbooks many students will choose instead to pay a small fee and simply rent the textbook for that semester. Only buying the ones they plan to reuse.",

Madatory book, wrote by the professor.\n\nAnother semester bought a mandatory book for class. 2 weeks in the professor no longer teaches the class (not sure but assume he got fired). New professor requires us by book for the class, as he is teaching the class differently. Fucking book was $250. And all it was was he had taken excerpts out of other published books and smashed them in his own book, cost was high due to licensing fees. As it was a \"custom book\" the bookstore wouldn't buy it back. Saw the same book on the shelf next semester....\n\nGood Ol' MSU. Public University was awful at this as the professors of your gen classes didn't give a shit and only taught so they could do research. Never went to private so can't say anything that way.

I had two days to return it for full price. I went straight to the library and spent hours copying it on a scanner and emailing it to myself. Page by fucking page. That was just one of like 8 textbooks I needed that semester. ",

            "Yup. Can conform. The used market is pretty good though. They even have single use digital editions that can expire at the end of the semester (mastering physics, mastering chemistry); thus ensuring that you always buy a new book and cannot re-sell.\n\n Never buy from the campus bookstore when you can help it. You will be gouged.",
            "Oh yes it is very true. Sometimes books can cost way more than 150.00.  Resale value at the end of the semester is practically nothing at the college bookstore. Sometimes you get a better resale price with Amazon.  The kicker is when the professor authors their own textbook and make it an requirement for their class. Then they make a minor change to the textbook so the next year students are required to buy the new edition. It\u2019s a tidy income for the professor. ",

They actually keep loanable textbooks and my school had a partnership with about 7 other schools so we could order books and borrow them from their libraries. \n\nI borrowed most of my textbooks for the one month and just paid the 10 cent late fee daily for the final 2 months of the semester.\n\nAlso.... biology and chemistry textbooks probably go about $300 new instead of $150",

I was so pissed that I waited near the bookstore the next semester for a few hours and handed it to the first person I saw buying the book. I told them they could have it for free and to please try and hand if off to someone else next semester if possible. They handed me $20 and told me to get lunch.",

            "I worked in a community college bookstore for several years (it was actually one of my favorite jobs until management changed and they started treating me like shit,) and I saw book prices rising every semester at alarming rates. For the Intro to Psychology class, for example, all but one of the teachers on campus used the same book. It cost about $70, I think, when I started working at the bookstore in 2005, and by the time I left in 2010, 5 years and at least 3 editions later, the same book was around $180. And that was a basic book with no software included. The books for accounting and nursing and computer coding and higher math could run $200-300 easily.\n\nAs a college instructor, I used course reserves the last 2 semesters so my students didn't have to buy the $80 textbook for the 4 essays I wanted them to read in it, and for this semester I found one for $30 that can also double as a research aid for them.",
            "Yes, it's common for the $150 textbook to have a new revision the next year or the professor decides to switch textbooks entirely.\n\nBut the real scum move is that many professors will require you to purchase an \"access code\" to some webapp to do homework or something.  Typically, these \"access codes\" can only be purchased with the book, or are almost expensive as the book with code if you buy just the code.  Needless to say, the access codes are one-time use, so you can't sell them or buy them used.\n\nIt's really scummy when said professor only ends up using this ridiculously overpriced software once or twice during the semester.\n\nAnd it's even more scummy when you find out that the professor helped write the book or otherwise gets paid for effectively being a textbook salesman.  It's ridiculous and universities should put a stop to it.",
            "Yeah it happens if people are dumb enough to fall for the trap. I\u2019ve nearly done with my 6th semester of college majoring in finance and I almost NEVER buy textbooks simply because I believe hard text information is becoming obsolete. \n\nIf I\u2019m having issues with a financial equation or any math related problems, I go to the professor during their office hours and get extra help. \n\nIf I don\u2019t know certain vocabulary or information I reread the professors lecture slides which are posted on their university web page.\n\nIf all else fails, I fucking google it. It really isn\u2019t that hard. \n\nNow the real crime is the Pearson Lab Mastering access codes that I have to buy 3 of every semester just so I can do my homework. That is complete and utter bullshit. ",

            "Would they be open to therapy? Because therapy and moving on might help them accept the psychic\u2019s a fraud.\n\nAnother option is maybe to find a really cheap psychic that might give them some comfort. Sometimes people know they\u2019re being taken advantage of, but don\u2019t want to acknowledge it because it also means they have to acknowledge a lot more. It\u2019s not unusual to be in denial of a loss. Sometimes, those things can help, but they can\u2019t be done forever, and especially if it\u2019s causing significant financial loss. That\u2019s why if you can get a really cheap psychic and convince them to go to them (maybe even give the cheap psychic some really secret info to make them seem even better), you can cut back on money and let them come back to reality on their own.\n\nThe thing about these things is they\u2019re kind of a Chinese finger trap. The more you resist, the harder it is to get out. If you keep bluntly going at it, it\u2019s going to feed into their bias and they\u2019ll feel more reason to want to think the psychic is real. Playing along might help if you\u2019ve got a plan, you just can\u2019t show your hand too early. This is also why therapy might help. Maybe tell them you need therapy and want to do it with them. Let them know you\u2019re in pain about the loss too (which I\u2019m sure you are, but I\u2019m saying lay it all bare, don\u2019t keep any walls up), this should help foster a deeper connection. Don\u2019t be blunt in your persuasion, be surreptitious. Connect with your family. However, keep your wits about you. Always remember it\u2019s almost impossible to have rational thought when emotions are high. Our neurological pathways are designed so the prefrontal cortex is less active the higher your emotions are. So, let your guard down, but don\u2019t get too emotional. Sorry I can\u2019t give more detailed info on a plan there. I can just state the foundation, because everything else is going to have to be based on you and your family.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss, I hope all this can be sorted out.",

They need counseling and grief management. \n\nMy best advice is to ignore this charlatan entirely and focus on trying to get them into some better grief management. Find a good well rated counselor that deals with grief and convince them to go. If you are financially stable enough buy them some time with the counselor and ask them to go. Tell them it couldn't hurt and you are just trying to help. \n\nOnce they start to deal with their grief in a more constructive way they may regain the emotional stability to see the psychic for what they are. Hopefully they will let the psychic go on their own because that is probably the only way it's going to happen.\n\nGood luck OP and for what its worth I hate those clowns too.",

            "As someone who believes in psychics, and has frequented a few over the years, I'll just say this.\n\nAny that charge are either running a gig, not a fake gig but are just smart enough to capitalize on their gifts, and confident enough in them that no one will take legal action on them (or are quick to admit they're wrong and provide a full refund), OR are fakes who probably know a thing or two about psychology.\n\nAny that are free and ask for donations only are probably either genuine or unsure of their own gifts.\n\nAnd any who do it free without charge and aren't clearly reacting to given information only are most likely genuine.\n\nWith ONE exception (well, maybe more but I digress), any one can become smart enough or educated on how to 'read' a person.  Many of these people are cons but still manage because they don't mislead people so much as redirect the ways they see things, which that versus blowing your mind at how well they understand a situation as if they know more than they should, it's not easy to spot the difference and further it's very easy to completely deny them if you're a skeptic or undoubtedly believe everything they say as a true believer.\n\nIt's, in my experience, a mixture of pulling out the wrong bits (for any reason, misinterpretation, ignorance, etc) and focusing on the right bits.\n\nBut if you want my opinion, talk to the psychic and politely ask they stop so that everyone can grieve and move on without holding onto some hope they'll ever interact with their loved one again in this life...as harsh as that is, ask him first and then ask him to stop accepting their money.  If he doesn't, it'll be time to consider consulting another 'psychic' to tell them she's at peace and ready to move on, and just needs their acceptance of this fact to do so.  I mean, I've researched the afterlife since I was 13, and all I've read points me to believe she's moved on by now, but visits occasionally to check up on her past life out of care and love.  I'm sure she'd say a thing or two, well actually, I'm more sure she'd accept the situation, even possibly as a typical thing to occur given the people involved, and still be at peace with the whole thing cause, you know, I mean really, she's passed on, her concerns here are over, it is what it is, she isn't coming back to say or do anything, it is done, and she can move on to the next great adventure of her life as an immortal eternal and possibly infinite being of consciousness and energy.\n\nIt's sad, hard, and imo totally messed up, but that's reality, our reality.\n\nSo one way or another, if you are bothered by this situation enough to ask for help, then I say consider other's advice on finding a 'second opinion'.  The problem is they won't accept it from you so asking another, preferably genuine psychic for help to provide it would be useful.  Just don't get mad and call them fake too if they say he's legit.  Cause really you'll just be back at square one, instead, find another opinion.\n\nOf course, you should do this after talking to him directly and asking him to stop.  Tell him his services are no longer wanted or needed and that it's time to start grieving with the loss by accepting the absence of her presence, and that his continual effort to keep that presence alive and...present is not healthy for them at this point.  If he refuses, quite literally he's not a psychic at that point, and it'll be up to you how to go from there.\n\nSorry for rambling, it's a complex thing, dealing with pathological liars.",

            "I feel your pain and frustration, truly.  My father passed away (eight years last Thursday) and my aunt contacted me about meeting with this \"psychic\" to \"get in touch with \\[my father's\\] spirit.\"  I was honestly blown away that she would fall for something like this, but as you say, these \"psychics\" prey on people's grief.\n\nMy other aunt was actually the one to successfully discourage her sister from continuing to entertain this charlatan.  It required playing into her sister's beliefs a bit, so it might be distasteful or even slightly dishonest, but in my view it is justified.  Basically my aunt told her sister that engaging in this type of contact might unintentionally invite foul spirits instead of her late brother.\n\nNot to knock anyone's beliefs, but I am a staunch atheist and absolute skeptic, so I don't believe in anything paranormal or supernatural.  I didn't think this type of reasoning would work with my aunt, but I was thinking about it from my perspective, not hers.  She immediately broke off contact with the \"psychic\" and never brought the idea up again, saying her sister was right in that it could unwittingly open a floodgate of evil spirits.  So, mission accomplished, even if it took a little deception.",

            "In the situation you/they are in, there is no way that you will convince them. They are being willfully ignorant, and by doing so have probably already become deluded into believing every lie from the psychic. They might normally be unwilling to be taken advantage of, but in this case they are distraught and want any and all relief from their pain. \n\nMaybe one day years into the future they might resent being weak/victimized in this moment, but I doubt they will feel this way anytime sooner.\n\nI understand it hurts you to see this happen to them, and to see them allow it, but anything you do to take this away from them will just cause a rift to form between you.\n\n\n\n\nP.S. I believe this to be true from some personal experience with a similar, but less severe matter. My mother in law lost her mother to illness a few years back. Both herself and her Mother believed in supernatural/psychic whatever. She went to a psychic that she had visited before years ago, and got told everything she wanted to hear, that was just of course the common universal spiel, and whatever was researchable by the psychic. \n\nMy MIL was already a believer in this shit, so she just lapped it up and let it reinforce her beliefs. On top of this, the lady told her that she also had \u201cThe Gift\u201d, and would be able to hear/communicate with spirits if she chose to. Thankfully due to her own fears of the unknown and whatever she imagines could potentially happen, she hasn\u2019t opened that can of crazy yet.\n\nTo further the point, due to my MILs belief and fear of the supernatural, my own wife also believes in it. My wife believes the bullshit her mom tells her, and believes in spirits, ghosts, etc. she has no interest in pursuing any of this thankfully though, because she is terrified of everything. She gets scared even from having conversations about this stuff. \n\nI tried a few times to debate with her how it\u2019s not real, and people are taking advantage of their desires and fears. I tried to talk her into accepting the possibility that it wasn\u2019t real. It does not matter how you present any of this knowledge to people who believe. They are zealots in their beliefs as strongly as many religious people. \n\nThe only way people like this can see the truth for what it is, is if they realize it for themselves. Anyone who tries to enlighten them will be seen as lying, or patronizing. In this situation you can either choose to be right and become an enemy, or you can choose to be silent and remain a friend.",

(by potentially real, i mean more legitimate. still depends whether you believe their work is even legitimate.)\n\n\n0.) never let yourself be coaxed into telling this person anything about the person they\u2019re attempting to contact. if they ask you things, answer yes or no. no specific details, even if you think they\u2019re super general. if they aren\u2019t able to elaborate, they\u2019re fake.\n\n\n1.) anyone who doesn\u2019t know you will never have the ability to decide to contact a deceased loved one. how would they know that person is deceased if they\u2019ve never met you? if someone approaches you saying this before you\u2019ve told them anything, especially if they ask for money before they tell you anything, they\u2019re fake.\n\n\n2.) a lot people with these abilities are contacted by the deceased, rather than being able to contact them in a matter of minutes. from my experience at least, a lot of times when you try to contact someone rather than them contacting you, they don\u2019t wanna talk. a deceased loved one being instantly willing to talk is a minor red flag.\n\n\n3.) if they ask for an obscene amount of money, regardless of how far into the process they are, (especially right off the bat) they\u2019re either fake or they have a very inflated ego.\n\n\n4.) \u2018psychics\u2019 who have ads online are obviously scammers. if one contacts you in a comment section or a direct message in light of you talking about something that happened, they could be legitimate or they could be trying to play off of your grief. with social media, you can always check their page. if they have no posts, it\u2019s not worth the risk. if they look sketchy, block them. you can usually tell the real ones from the fake ones by the way they talk about themselves and their practice.\n\n\n5.) there are certain things that separate real and fake \u2018psychics\u2019 in terms of vocabulary. real \u2018psychics\u2019 for the most part won\u2019t call themselves such. some people prefer to call themselves empaths, energy workers, necromancers, etc. there are a few \u2018psychics\u2019 who call themselves psychics or clairvoyants, but most are fake as these words are far more commonly understood as spiritual, and fakes often won\u2019t look into the practice.\n\n\n6.) from my experience, most real \u2018psychics\u2019 won\u2019t ask you for money. you\u2019ll never see a legitimate practitioner come up to someone and say \u201cfor $20 i\u2019ll tell you what your dead wife thinks about you.\u201d if someone approaches you with information about a deceased loved one, and doesn\u2019t want money in return, you can most likely trust what they\u2019re about to say. \n\n\nsource: i\u2019m a wiccan and a witch, and i specialize in divination and necromancy. i always have a tarot deck and a pendulum on hand. if i\u2019ve ever felt the need to give someone a tarot reading, it\u2019s always free. if someone\u2019s deceased loved one contacts me or someone i know wants me to contact one for them, it\u2019s always free. i don\u2019t feel the need to profit off of these skills or gifts, whatever you may call them. it feels unjust to me. i get paid in their contentment and relief, and the opportunity to further hone my skills."
