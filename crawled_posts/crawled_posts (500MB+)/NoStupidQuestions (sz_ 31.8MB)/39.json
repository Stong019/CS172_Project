She probably points it out from time to time as a way to get a self esteem or justification boost, but subconsciously, she\u2019s indicating that she is ready, and scared. Because it feels insurmountable and overwhelming, so it\u2019s easier to hear \u201coh no you are beautiful and fuckable and yadda yadda\u201d instead of what she needs to hear. \n\nLove and support. Love and support. Whenever she mentions feeling ugly or fat, it\u2019s a sign that she wants to ready. Just be prepared to be ready with her. Don\u2019t try to deny the \u201cI\u2019m fat\u201d right away, say that if she\u2019s unhappy with herself, you will be there for any changes *we* need to make to make it better. \n\nThe other thing you have to realize, is even though she definitely feels the effects of her weight, she doesn\u2019t really how shitty she feels literally all the time. Once she starts losing, she\u2019ll start to realize how much easier life is, and that\u2019ll encourage her. \n\nI really hope this helps.

            "So I\u2019m a mil spouse, and depression is really, really common in our world - we\u2019re very isolated, we can\u2019t find good jobs, we\u2019re far from our families, it\u2019s not exactly surprising that so many of us eat (or drink, or are bullies on social media) to try and cope with how shitty things can get. Add your wife\u2019s miscarriages to this, and the fact that endo is painful and hard to deal with on its own, and she\u2019s very high risk for depression. \n\nFrom what I hear, the Marines as a branch aren\u2019t super great about supporting spouses or about promoting mental health care, which I think is a real shame - you and your family deserve proper care, and there\u2019s no reason someone couldn\u2019t be successful in their military career and still talk to a therapist. My advice would be for you guys to see about talking to a counselor of some sort first, either together or separately, to check in with her emotional well-being. If she\u2019s been having to \u2018suck it up\u2019 for too long because she\u2019s afraid that seeking a counselor will damage your career, she might be in a pretty dark headspace, and she\u2019ll need support from you AND a trained counselor to start feeling good enough to form healthier habits.\n\nI know that in the Air Force there are counseling and mental health resources that are outside the chain of command and totally confidential. I know that in all branches, the Chaplaincy functions in that role, but there are others as well, like the MFLC\u2019s. Help her find someone to talk to, help her get a support network going for the times you\u2019re busy or deployed, so that she\u2019s not having to deal with all of this alone during those times. I can tell you love her and you want what\u2019s best for her, and I admire you for that. But I also know your job probably has plenty of times where you can\u2019t be there for her, and she deserves to feel supported during those times as well.\n\nGood luck with all this; I know it\u2019s a lot to deal with. But it sounds like you really do have the willpower to be there for her through whatever she\u2019s going through, and that\u2019s going to take you pretty far. What\u2019s going to get you the rest of the way is having the right resources on hand to give your wife some professional-level support, so that she has the tools to start feeling better both emotionally and physically.",

            "First, she already knows she has a problem and knows it\u2019s unhealthy. She is probably utterly miserable too. But only she can fix it and that can only happen when she is ready. The very best you can do is support her, love her, appreciate her, tell her and show her that you love her no matter what and gently encourage her to eat more healthily. \n\nYou might start by telling her that she doesn\u2019t need to bring chips, cookies, soda, junky snacks home for you (she may be using that as a reason to have them in the house).  \n\nIt\u2019s very delicate ground you are treading on so don\u2019t push it. It HAS to come from her. When she\u2019s ready, WW has an excellent app so it can be followed online if it doesn\u2019t suit her to actually go to their meetings. It\u2019s a program which is healthy and easy to follow because it doesn\u2019t mean a restricted diet. It can be lived with. \n\nYou sound very caring and I know you want what is in her best interest but sadly people in her situation don\u2019t always see it for themselves. Sometimes it takes a long time. Sometimes it\u2019s just a matter of seeing an unexpected photo of themselves that triggers them into action . Be patient. The most important thing is that she doesn\u2019t feel criticised because that will have the opposite effect. Always be kind. Always love her. Always be supportive.",

I have the same problem and I'm a big person with high stress levels even though I'm only in my 30s. Chronic high blood pressure will lead to other irreversible organ system issues down the line. You might consider mentioning this to her. She may want to see a doctor about her headaches. Obviously losing weight can help if she does have high BP (and I have a feeling she does.)\n\nShe's also more likely to develop diabetes. Diabetes is fucking worse than cancer (IMO).

I can tell you, she knows she's overweight so telling her she needs to lose weight isn't going to be supportive or helpful. Also, pressuring her to change her diet and exercise will just come across as judgemental. It's a viscous cycle she's in and she feels helpless and powerless, so of course she's depressed. What can help? When she's ready, she needs to see a doctor who specializes in weight loss issues who also provides nutritional and emotional counseling. My husband and I went to a Bariatric Seminar that the hospital offered just to get some information. After making an appointment with them and learning all we could, I was able to take the weightloss path that was right for me which was nutritional and emotional counseling and then surgery. That was 3 years ago. BEST. DECISION. EVER. Now more than ever she needs your love and support, not your judgement.",

If your wife is sad, it can help just to have any physical activity. and tell her you find her beautiful still. That will help her more than anything, having support even if she is struggling.

I know it's emotional eating, and it's really hard to stop or get perspective about why I'm harming myself, because the food is comforting and it feels good to have a full belly. Talk to your wife, let her know you care deeply about her and you're concerned for her health, that you love her no matter what, and you will help her with anything. Be honest with her and ask for complete honesty from her. Maybe she's desperately unhappy in the marriage and doesn't know how to tell you.

Next week we are starting a 4 month training program for a half marathon in April. I would suggest that you approach the conversation about health rather than weight. If the unhealthy eating habits are newer maybe there is an underlying reason for it (my husband eats less healthy when he is depressed).

But it is indeed better to not bring it like she has to lose weight in the first place. \n\n\nLittle over me: I have been obese, and I sure can tell you food and especially fast food and sugar are so, so addictive. The more I ate, the more I wanted to eat and thought about food throughout the day. Food made me really unhappy, becauses I knew it was making my body hurt, and making me chubby, but I couldn't stop eating. I mostly ate because.. I actually don't know. I just wanted to eat, I guess it can really be an addiction. \n\n\nThe cravings for sugar will get a lot less already after a few days of not eating sugar (as in candy, Starbucks, etc.), this holds for fast food as well but less. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nSo, tell her you want to see her happy and healthy. As others commented, you can tell her you want to be happy and healthy yourself, and tell her how a healthy lifestyle will help you achieve that. You can tell her all you want to tell her, but make it about yourself in the first place. But ask her to join in with you.

The math simply does not work out. One 20oz bottle of soda is 50 minuets of exercise. So you need to ask yourself, or rather your wife needs to ask her self, can you do 50+ minuets of exercise a day for one soda. Then ask how much more exercise you need to burn off that handful of M&M's, and that extra large fry, and every other junk food item your wife eats.

I have thoughts on 3 aspects of your situation: talking to your wife, the endometriosis, and any psychological issues (even if just from being overweight or being unable to maintain a pregnancy. I\u2019m a guy, but I\u2019ve heard both are very stressful).\n\nThe topic you\u2019re interested in is called motivational interviewing.

(I\u2019m not a doctor, and I don\u2019t attend BUMC linked below, but take my word for it)\n\nI don\u2019t want to try teach it in a Reddit post, but the first two steps are to see yourself as a supporter/friend/advisor to your wife, and not as a paternalistic figure. Ultimately you want her to make her own decisions.\n\nThe second step is figure out where she is, and meet her there. Ask her how she feels. Ultimately, you ask how she feels about her weight, and if she wants something different. Is she ready to change? Does she have a plan? Is she ready to implement a plan? These states of readiness are dynamic. There are different approaches based on which stage she\u2019s at\n\nHere\u2019s a decent resource.\n\n[Boston University Medical School motivational interviewing ](http://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/MPH-Modules/SB/BehavioralChangeTheories/BehavioralChangeTheories6.html) \nhttp://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/MPH-Modules/SB/BehavioralChangeTheories/BehavioralChangeTheories6.html\n\n\n\nThe other two factors are the endometriosis and any psychological issues. I think everyone should have a therapist. You can go together it helps.\n\nThe endometriosis is an obstetical/gynecological issue.

            "I was 149 kg (328 lps) This is some insights from a fat woman on why choosing to loose weight is a long, long process that has way more to do with psychology than physiology. I hope you can gain some perspective. \n\nFor me this has been a life long issue. Since I was pre-pubescent I was told that I'm fat and because of that no one will love me. \n\nThe first hurdle I had to face was admitting to my self that I was fat. I've always been thick but after depression and injury hit me hard I was straight up obease. I was in denial for a long time. I deffintly knew i was a big girl but somehow I was both hyper aware of my size and yet never realised how big I was. If my weight was mentioned at all, for any reason I'd have a near mental breakdown. It had always, always been used to make me feel like shit in the past so having an extremely negitive reaction was almost a learned response. Didn't matter if It was a doctor asking about my health or a friend asking what clothes size I wear. It felt like an attack. \nI was also socialised with a very Us vs. Them in regards to other women. Ie. I was raised on a constant stream of \"Don't trust skinny bitches, they all think they're better then you. The \"and they are\" was implied. Its insane how much I internalised mysoginist steryotypes about women.  To a young me a woman could not possibly be both kind and pretty. And to be pretty she was skinny. So my whole identity was based around \"but she has a great personality.\" It was very black and white. \n\nFat girls: nice, cool, funny, family orientated, likes burgers. \nSkinny girls: mean, bitchy, slutty, boring, into fitness, vein,  into fad dieting. \n\nTo young me these were universal truths. In fact I remember being utterly shocked in highschool that a girl I dismissed as thin and pretty and thus a bitch, wanted to talk to me and be my friend. She was a really sweet girl. I had no idea that was a possibility. \n\nSo in order to not be associated with the negitive stereotypes I listed I also rejected the idea of health and fitness since I grouped them togther mentally. That was for skinny girls and I'm a cool thick girl who chooses comfort over vanity, right?  (So wrong. I was uncomfortable im my body almost constantly since I got my first bra.)\n\nWhat helped me was the body positivity and feminist movement. That \"men don't love fat girls\" mantra I was raised with was one of the first notions I had to challange. I did this by actively looking for women in the real world who were both fat and we're clearly in a relationship. I did it with friends, family and aquantances. I followed plus size models. I looked for fat role models and looked for proof that people could love them. It took me a realy long time to let my learned bias against traditionally beautiful women go. Thats where feminisim really helped me. The idea that im not inherantly in competition with other women and that a woman's physical attributes don't reflect her personality or morals is now very important to me. Also the idea of what it means to \"have morals\"  has changed a lot for me over time. I don't think sex has any moral implications anymore unless its non-consensual.  \n\nAt 24 I had to stop working due to extreme depression, anxiety and chronic pain. This is when I got really, really big. Until this point I was around maybe an Australian size 20 but after this point I put on weight fast and hard. I was at least a size 26, thats when I got upto my heaviest which was 149kg. \n\n\nYou may have seen the fat acceptance movement try to remove the negitive associations with the term \"fat\" by rebranding it as a neutral descriptive term. \"She has brown hair, a blue shirt, a pet dog, she is fat.\" To have the word \"fat\" not be inherantly bad allows us to utilize the language in a more meaningful way. This really worked for me. To me fat was so loaded. \n\nFat= gross, ugly, undisciplined, morally bad.\n\nSo by using it purely as a term to describe a body shape and nothing else it finally allowed me to say \"I am fat.\" You have no idea what a crucial step that was for me. \n\n\"Im fat\" became \"Im fat and thats ok.\" A lot of people say this is encouraging obesity but thats completely stupid. I was already fat. Very few people with standard body sizes are going to actively try and become obease. Its rebranding. Its coping. Its a way to not feel disgusted by yourself. **Its ok for a fat person to not fucking hate themselves.**\nAnd its what I needed at the time. \nI put the mental energy that normally went into hating myself into therapy. I challanged other negitive thought patterns about myself. I went on anti depressants and  the pill to controll a hormone imbalance. Both meds have side effects that include weight gain. \n\nThis whole process is cyclical not linear. Im constantly relearning how to not hate myself. The process i described thus far started in my early teens. Im 27 and im only now starting to see continual improvements.  \n\nIn 2016 I was so depressed from a combination of my appearance, my chronic pain (which yes the weight excaserbated dramatically), my inability to work and my underlying mental issues that I made a decision. I would either find a way to get weight loss surgery or I would kill myself. \n\nSo I started doung some research. I am extremely lucky to live in Australia and to have the financial support of a family member. I live with my brother, we are very close. He pays the lions share of our living expenses since im on a government \"job seeker\" payment. (They won't acknowledge my disability.) Our medical system is very good and I had several options. \nI ended up getting health insurance. This was $70 a fortnight that had a 1 year waiting period for elective surgery. This covered the majority of the cost, off the top of my head i think they covered $20000. That left roughtly $7000 out of pocket. I was able to access my superannuation. I figured that if I didnt get the surgery I'd be to dead to use it by retirement age anyway. \n\nIn that year I tried again to diet. I saw a dietician, tried to excercise. But if I lost 10kg I'd just gain it back again when my resolve crumbled. Depression makes sticking to any normal eating pattern for long really hard. I would go from eating all day, to eating one big meal a day to calorie counting. Sometimes I could only eat a tin of tuna all day. Sometimes I'd get 3+ burgers from a take out joint and eat untill i felt sick. \n\nIn 2017 I was finally eligible for my surgery. It took me a while to find a surgeon i trusted but after a few false starts I did. I started seeing a dietician again and I was put on a 6 week pre-surgery very low calorie diet. It was extremely restrictive but knowing that the diet had a deadline helped me a lot. The goal was to shrink my liver before surgery. On the 6th of April i got my Gastric Sleeve surgery. \n\nIt was uncommonly painful for me. Something about the surgery set of my chronic back pain to unbearable levels. I didnt register any pain from the surgery its self. The first night of recovery was me waking up every hour on the hour and tearfully begging for morphine. The pain lasted for about a week, though it slowly improved. \n\nSo now its November, almost December. Roughly 8 months and I've lost 52kg. 149kg down to my current 97kg. Again this has not been simple or easy. \nIts absoloutely possible to rupture your staples in the early days. It takes 6-8 weeks to eat normal textured foods again. You need to have a good understanding of nutrition so that you don't become nutritionally deficient. You also start allowing yourself to eat unhealthy foods again. \n\nDifferent people handle this in different ways. Some try a cold turkey approach to fats and sugars. Notice im not calling them bad foods. Foods are foods and have no moral value. Just nutritional. Thats how I handle it. I focus on earing the 5 major food groups and work frequently with my dietician to ensure im educated enough to make informed choices. If I eat a lot of fat one day its ok. I just won't make a habbit out of it. I do heavily restrict my sugar i take however thats not hard for me because I always favoured savoury food over sweet. \n\nMy mental health has improved dramatically over the last 3-4 years. Im a lot nicer to myself these days. My chronic back pain is still there. It hasnt gone away. Its certianly improved. I can wear a bra now! (For a while!) I recently did a work trial but it was to much for my back. An MRI says I have 3 \"slightly bulging\" disks but im not sure at what point that happened. Im currently able to fit into some size 16 clothes. Im far more mobile than I have been in years and a lot more mentally alert. \n\nThe point of this long rambling story is that weight is just one aspect of a persons health. Do not expect an obease person to simply \"go on a diet.\" Its unrealistic. \nAnother thing, education from a reliable source is crucial. People make money of selling misinformation about weightloss and it makes it nearly impossible to understand what your actully susposed to eat when your as uneducated as I was. A dietician is a doctor who had to get a degree. A nutritionist can get a certificate online after a 3 hour course. \n\nSo how do you talk to your wife about her issues? \nBest case scenario? You dont. Send her to a mental health profesional. If shes anything like I was she will see it as an attack on her looks at best or she will think you blame her for the miscarriages at worse.  \n\nIf thats not an option your going to have to be very delicate. I really don't have a lot of advice to give you. Just know that she's probably not going to taken it well, at least at first.",

            "Keep in mind that obesity is a chronic condition, kind of like diabetes. It requires life long management (meaning any changes you make to manage it need to be sustained, or the weight comes back). Statistically people can lose 5-10% from their highest weight by making lifestyle changes. The body has strong physiological responses to weight loss attempts that prevent us from being able to lose weight.  There\u2019s also a lot more to managing obesity than eating well and exercising. Stress, sleep, medications, mental health, time management - all are things that impact weight.  The view society has surrounding weight is incredibly pervasive, sad and not helpful to those who struggle with it. \n\nLeading by example can be a good start. If you can, access health professionals who understand obesity (again, it\u2019s a chronic condition), and programs if they are available where you are .

            "Have you asked her if she's happy?\n\nStudies show that shaming people about their weight causes them to gain weight, not lose it. And I know you don't want to shame your wife, but approaching her about her weight may make her feel shame, it probably already does, I know mine does. It's that shame spiral that puts us in a binge cycle or makes us unable to stop eating terribly or start healthier habits. Similar to addicts.\n\nI say that to say this, for me, I tend to lose weight when I'm happy, or less stressed, and not focused so much on the shame of the bad habits. So don't make it about the weight or the eating, make it about how she feels. Cook her a great meal, sit down and eat together, no phones, talk to her. Ask her how eating dinner together as a couple makes her feel? Is that something she wants to do more often? Can we do it every Tuesday? Maybe 3 times a week? Suddenly meal times are a moment of peace with hubby and not about deciding what binge food to eat alone.\n\nAsk her if she's happy. Is there anything you can do to make her less stressed? Is there some therapy she can go to if there's serious stress in your lives to work out her issues and feel heard?\n\nIf you approach it from that perspective then I guarantee that you are more likely to help your wife eventually lose some weight. You are also more likely to help her in a hundred deeper ways she probably also needs. Because in your scenario it sounds like the weight is a symptom of something else.",

            "I'd say help her work on her mental health above all else. Personally, when I'm really struggling I binge eat (actually binge, not the haha I binge version), I crave easy, unhealthy food, specifically sugar, but also fatty and salty foods. I have PCOS, depression and social and general anxiety (all diagnosed) - I've tried many medications for each thing. All I can say is, when I'm stressed, I feel guilty/worthless for not being able to handle more. Then I just spiral.\n\nWorking on my mental health, celebrating little victories like \"I showered every day this week\" really made an impact on how I eat.\n\nSo I used to get take out around 3 times a week. And sometimes, I'd order an extra meal for the next day because I was feeling so bad. I'd also get Crisps, chocolate, sweets and whatever else I wanted from the shop, and by that i mean my boyfriend would get them for me because he didn't want to see me sad, not understanding the complexities of what I was going through. I wouldn't shower for 3-4 days at a time, sometimes more. I'd honestly believe I was doing well if I went outside once last week. I isolated myself so badly. I lost a bunch of friends. I made excuses not to see my family. I had a panic attack if someone knocked on my door. It was so bad.\n\nSo I got some anti anxiety medication. Then I started going outside, hanging with my family and going out with my boyfriend more. Then I started drinking water instead of pop. Then, at new years last year, I decided no more take out. Then, I got myself into a routine of having 3 meals a day, I'd often skip breakfast and sometimes lunch and then binge all night. 3 meals a day really helped. Then, I made myself shower every single morning no matter what. Most recently I joined a choir, rediscovered my love for music and made new friends. \n\nI'll say I didn't take take out or pop right out of the question, I didn't want to be super restrictive. But I didn't get pizza for almost 6 months, and when I did it was at my sisters house for a pizza catch up night with a bunch of family. I made it a treat. Not something I'd get at the end of a long day.\n\nI wouldn't say I'm doing amazingly well right now, I'm in the process of moving house, I've been having a hard time the past couple of months. But I'm not guilt tripping myself for having too much sweet stuff or whatever. And my goal isn't to lose weight, I want to be healthy. I'm hoping weight loss will be a side effect, but I mainly want to improve my health and fitness.\n\nTake baby steps, but make the focus mental health and physical health. It's amazing how much easier things are when you don't hate yourself.\n\nGood luck to you both!",

            "I have gained and lost substantial weight in my life, and for me, the biggest factor is cooking at home vs eating out.  Rather than focus on anybody's weight, perhaps try taking over the household cooking and shopping in an effort to start a healthier household lifestyle. One of my favorite food writers, Mark Bittman, his philosophy is, eat anything you want as long as you make it yourself. Start packing lunches, and cooking dinner. It is also a huge money saver. If tomorrows lunch is leftovers of tonights dinner, which was moderately healthy, you save cash and help the situation along.\n\nIf you are interested, I strongly suggest a basic cooking class, and a knife skills class- if you know how to use a knife like a pro, cooking is much much faster. Cooking can even be a hobby you develop together. I have never really seen anyone successfully lose weight because their spouse wanted them to, but we all have up cycles and down cycles, think of this as a household issue, and I think you can find a healthier way to live as a couple.\n\nall the best\n\nedit- before having a kid, this would have sounded like a monumental amount of work, but after becoming a parent and doing it everyday for 7 years, it is no trouble at all and usually takes me less than an hour.

Try to look at it through that lens yourself, since that's really what's important here. \n\nShe could easily be using junk food as a comping mechanism for her poor health or other stressors, and making her feel shitty for being overweight will likely make her feel worse. People who overeat as a comping mechanism can easily switch to starving themselves intermittently or consistently, forcing themselves to throw up, overusing diet pills and/or  laxatives, and other very unhealthy behaviour.

            "The larger issue at hand is the cost of tuition. Going to college shouldn't cost the price of a new car every year. Theres also the issue with colleges spending habits. Being in two different school I witnessed both constantly building new multimillion buildings on campus and one was a small state school and the other a D1, well known, school. Lowering interest rates and forgiving some loans will help those now but for future students there needs to be reform on how the US regulates and funds education.",
            "I am 100% behind tackling student loans by interest rate. Or just capping how much interest can be accrued relative to the original amount loaned.\n\nI\u2019m happy to pay them off, but with the interest and a crappy job, the loans can get bigger faster than you can pay. Imho, that\u2019s the real issue with student debt.",
            "Yes. This would be better for the borrowers.\n\nI\u2019m sure the lenders have agreed to wipe $10k because they know they\u2019ll make it back in interest anyway.\n\nFor many borrowers $10k doesn\u2019t solve student debt problems just delays them.",
            "This is not an either or scenario. Clearly anyone with 10k or under benefits more from cancelling the debt. Without doing the math I would even say people up to 15k benefit from it being paid off because having the majority of your principle disappear is going to drastically cutback your interest accrual. \n\nIt really just depends on how much left you have to pay off. If you've got 100k student loan debt, yes obviously having 0% interest helps you more there.",
            "Considering I get over $700 in interest added to my principle every month, yes.",
            "I believe I read somewhere that it is not within the president\u2019s power to change the interest rate - it must be done by Congress. \n\nSo the answer is absolutely yes, but the person doing the cancelling cannot do that unilaterally.",

Extortion, plain and simple.",
            "I don't live in the US, but if a loan is 0%, what happens is people of rich families take that money and invest it somewhere like a tax sheltered savings account for leveraged gains, while they are in school. I am not saying that's the worst, but I am saying that's a loophole waiting to happen. It's better to lower the cost of education if we are talking about financial relief for JUST education.",

            "This may have been great at the beginning but now that we've had 20 years of paying on the debt while interestwas allowed to go hog wild, have to pay it for a second or third time will still prevent people from participating as consumers and saving for retirement. The poverty situation for the old and indigent will be devastating 40 years from now--and everyone will end up paying for that. Might as well let people attempt to save themselves from it now.",

We will become completely dependent on other countries if we don\u2019t improve our education system soon.\n\nSecond, there are people that have been making payments on their student loans for years and and have barely touched the principle. Yes, it is on them for not realizing that they aren\u2019t paying enough but it is, also, on the predatory lenders that put them in that position. For our entire lives we\u2019ve been told that the path to the \u201cAmerican Dream\u201d is to go to college, get a degree, and move up the ladder. Well, a lot of us didn\u2019t have the money for college so we went the borrower route. Now we have a generation saddled with crippling debt because they did what they were told.\n\nAll that said, my and my wife\u2019s student loans are long since paid off\u2026and I support the government paying off as much of everyone\u2019s loans that we can. If it\u2019s $10,000 or $100,000, I don\u2019t care. And, no, I\u2019m not going to quibble about \u201cnot getting my share\u201d.

That's insanity. Someone who has over 50k in loans, if they take 10k off, they're not really helping that person in any way. The principal isn't what's killing people for decades. It's the rate.

Only Congress has the power to make money decisions, and the current Congress has a Republican majority meaning there's no way student loan interest rate stuff would pass. \n\nThe President can however make use of certain processes that exist within the department of education as a sort of loophole to try and wipe some of the debt, so that is how it's being done / discussed.",
            "I personally think that they should force banks to consider 30% of the interest paid back on any student loans as paid down on principle as well as resetting the interest rate to something around 1% or 2%. Of course these numbers could be changed but it would help all the people whose interest has grown their total loan to something larger than it started even though they've been paying it back for years.",

            "Sadly, there are a huge percentage of those students who never intended to pay the loans back at all.",
            "Bit of a thought exercise:\n\nSuppose you loaned me $10,000 at the agreement that I would pay you back $15,000 over the course of 10 years. Then the government steps in and says that all I have to pay you back is the $10,000, but I still have 10 years to do so.\n\nNow you can't access your $10,000 for 10 years. 10 years from now, your $10,000 isnt going to worth as much as it is right now.\n\nAre you going to be willing to loan anyone else money over the long term again?\n\nWe have a few problems at play here. \n\n1. All students are being pressured to go to university.\n\n2. The federal government decided to back student loans to ensure everyone can obtain the money to attend college.\n\n3. Seeing 1 and 2, colleges decided to start adding majors that dont actually help you find a good paying career, they started tacking irrelevant requirements onto majors (you have to take more classes in the US to get a degree than most of the rest of the world), they started pouring more and more resources into attracting students to their college rather than actually pouring it into their academic offerings, and they dont worry much about how much they charge because students will be able to pay them the money up front.\n\n\nSo my response to these issues:\n\n1. Not all students should go to university. It may not be a good fit for them. I started in a university but wasnt willing to take out loans. Stopped because tuition increased every year. Finished a 2 year degree in a community college. I currently work as the only one of my coworkers with less than a bachelor's, make the same income, have no student debt, and actually earn more than most people with bachelors. Industries in the us are absolutely hurting for people in skilled trades. Trade schools, apprenticeships, and other similar paths are better fits for most people, and they will likely end up earning more in the end if they go that route anyway.\n\n2. If you are going to have federally backed loans, there needs to be guidelines as to what those loans can be used for. They should not be used for any class whose subject matter isnt directly related to the major, regardless of whether or not the college wants to call it \"general ed.\" They should also not be used for any major that doesn't yield a high percentage of high earning graduates.\n\n3. I honestly think colleges should be opened up to class action lawsuits for defrauding their students with useless majors and classes, but if you address 1 and 2, colleges will be forced to cut the useless fat out of their curriculum and drop tuition prices.\n\nAs for the individuals who are trapped under student loans, I'm sorry, but they took those loans out as adults and they are on the hook to pay them back. Short of opening up universities to class action lawsuits, I dont see adjust (edit: \"a just\") way of dealing with it. Robbing the people who currently hold the loans is no more just than forcing others who didnt take out the loans to pay them back (so called \"forgiveness\")",

What bank would loan 100k to a child when they know that child at any point could declare bankruptcy and get rid of the debt? They'd start requiring more stringent financial repayment capabilities, which would result in most students only being eligible for tiny personal loans except for those whose parents will cosign. Then, admission rate will plummet. Students will look more seriously at community College. Universities will be forced to compete for the smaller pool of students, reducing price over time. Everyone will complain that college is *actually* unaffordable, because kids literally won't have enough money to go any more. And so, the political pressure will be immense for the government to subsidize again. It also works around the complaint that \"I got mine, why do they get free college?\" Because the people truly struggling with college debt can discharge it in bankruptcy now, but there's an obvious repercussion.

Right now tons of people have crushing debt that is hurting them AND the economy as a whole.\n\nEssentially the government holds students to a higher ethical and moral stand with regards to financial decisions than corporations, banks and the super rich.  Add to that that the government gives banksters super cheap loans (hovering a zero percent for years) to bail them out of the stupid mistakes they make and it sure smells like a grift of the regular citizenry.\n\nI get that some folks say 'why should someone get loan forgiveness on student debt if I struggled and paid mine off'.  Good on you for being responsible.  This attitude is understandable.  It ignores that the huge student debt is hurting the economy as a whole and you (the responsible party who did pay of your debt) will be better off because loan forgiveness helps the entire economy, including you.\n\nThis whole situation comes about because pols are paid off with ~~bribes~~ donations from stakeholders they cow tow to.\n_______\n\nYes, there is a large moral hazard if we tell students that they do not have to honor their obligations.  Very few people seem to be upset about the perverse incentive structure the economy is built on when we give the banksters a pass and expect much higher ethical standards from students.\n\nPerhaps a middle ground can be found.  Change the rules on student loans in two ways:\n\n1.  Give students the same preferential interest rates that are extended to the crony capitalists have bribed the pols to provide for them\n\n2.  For those who truly can't pay off student debt and get on with their lives (i.e. put food on the table and move forward and maybe own a home someday) change the laws so the debt can be eliminated with a legit bankruptcy.\n\nThese changes will help those with student debt and by extension help the entire economy.  The folks (some who are responsibly paying off their debts and some who say 'why should someone else be helped if I wasn't') who are against the loan elimination idea can just keep their mouths closed if this approach is taken.\n___________\n\nThis suggestion boils down to something really simple.

            "What you're noticing is what researchers call \"observation bias\". You're counting people with accidental pregnancies, but you're not counting all the people who don't have accidental pregnancy. The rates are really relatively low.\n\nBut to answer your question, a great many couples in their 20s have sex every day or even multiple times a day. There are a lot of opportunities to forget antipregnancy measures.",
            "People fuck every day. A LOT of people fuck every day. A LOT of people fuck every day while ovulating. A LOT of people fuck without birth control every day while ovulating.",
            "There's a bit more to it than just avoiding doing the deed when the woman is ovulating. In general it's easier to plan to when to do the deed to get pregnant than it is to avoid getting pregnant if that makes sense.\n\n\nEveryone's cycle is different, even if you're fairly regular, it's not an exact science. Sperm can also survive in the body for multiple days. So if you do the deed a few days before your ovulation window, you can still end up pregnant if there are sperm still hanging out when you ovulate. If you think your ovulation window passed, but it ended up being a bit late that month, you could get pregnant because you thought the window was already gone.\n\n\nIt isn't an all or nothing situation. Your chances of getting pregnant are rarely 0% or 100%, it's not a guaranteed outcome either way. Just because you do the deed while you're ovulating, you might not get pregnant. It's easier to get pregnant if you know when the ovulation window is (assuming no fertility issues), but it's still not a guarantee. \n\n\nIt's rare but you can even get pregnant during your period. You can technically get pregnant at any point in your cycle if for whatever reason your body decides to ovulate. Even if someone's cycle is relatively normal, sometimes menstruation just decides to do whatever it wants to do. Stress, major diet changes, etc. can even cause menstrual cycles to change. \n\n\nIt's almost impossible to tell when you've ovulated (as a general rule, without using tests, watching hormone levels, etc. and even then it's still not an exact science)... You can't really check to make sure there's no egg ready to go before you do the deed. There's a general best guess of when your ovulation window is, but they call it a window because it's really difficult to pinpoint exactly when you're going to ovulate. If you misjudge that window, you could get pregnant.\n\n\nThere's also the issue of birth control. Sometimes people don't use it correctly. Even if they use it correctly, sometimes something goes wrong (condom accidently breaking, etc). If you're on the pill, but you haven't been taking it 100% correctly, you could get pregnant. If you started taking an antibiotic but forgot that it can mess with the pills effectiveness, you could get pregnant. If you ended up vomiting pretty soon after taking the pill for whatever reason and didn't take another pill afterwards, you could get pregnant. If you had to change birth controls and forgot to wait enough time to make sure that your body adjusted appropriately (not always applicable but it can happen depending on the hormones used in each pill), you could get pregnant. If you're using an IUD and not also using a condom, it's rare but you can get pregnant. It's always safer to use multiple forms of birth control if you want the best chance at avoiding pregnancy.\n\n\nEven if both people do everything \"right,\" there's usually still a small chance of getting pregnant.",
            "1. It's never 0%, it's never 100%.\n2. Not every woman is the same.\n3. Sperm \"lives\" for a few days inside a womb.\n4. Fertility window means a higher likelihood of seeking sex.\n5.

            "I don't think its nearly that cut and dry when it comes to women's reproductive systems. My understanding is that there is a 6ish day window in which a woman is most fertile, but thats just an average. It doesn't mean you can't conceive the rest of the month, its just less likely to happen. Age, health, and genetics play a big role in this.\n\nAdditionally, sperm can stay in there for up to a week, so that practically doubles the timeframe. So lets say you have a yound couple having sex 6 times a month. They probably aren't doing it much the week of the period (YMMV), so that leaves 3 weeks a month for fun. For two out of those three weeks, the chances of pregnancy are pretty good, and for the third week they chances go down, but not entirely. Thats a lot of chances for an accidental pregnancy every month.",

            "A lot of people are missing your point and giving you false/incomplete information. You are correct that there is only about a 6 day window to get pregnant. It's just that those 6 days don't fall on the same cycle days for everyone. The average ovulation day for most people is on the 14th day of your cycle counting from the first day of your period. It can happen earlier or later, not everyone's cycle is the same. And it can change cycle to cycle based on stress or illness, etc. So relying on that information as birth control isn't foolproof. Sperm lives for up to 5 days in the vagina, and you only have 24-48 hours for the egg to become fertilized once it is released, so that is where the 6 days comes from. After that, your chances of getting pregnant are over until the next cycle. \n\nTo answer your question about how people accidentally get pregnant, 6 days is about 20% of the days in a 28 day cycle, so it's not a super low chance to hit one or more of those days. A lot of people also have been having unprotected sex for a long time before they get accidentally pregnant.",

As someone said, sperm can survive for five days, so if the sperm manages to live long enough and the woman ovulates, then pregnancy can happen. 2. Cycles can vary by month and ovulation can occur early or late. 3. Most women won\u2019t have sex on their period, so if they wait and have sex afterwards, again going back to 1 and 2, the sperm will survive long enough to fertilize an egg once ovulation occurs.

It depends on someone ovulation cycle, which can be guessed at but usually is monitored with hormone levels and peeing on an ovulation sticks to find out for sure. \n\n\nAnd you count from the first day of your last period (not the last day of the period, a lot of people make that mistake). \n\n\nSo a typical 28 day cycle: \n\n\nPeriod starts Day 1 ----- not able to get pregnant. \n\n\nDay 3-8 period stops.\n\n\nDay 5 - can have sex and sperm still alive by day 10. Not super likely with a very heavy flow.... But possible with a light one. \n\n\nDay 10 - Day 21 you ovulate in that time and it is possible to get pregnant.  Stress and a bunch of other factors can play a role in what day you ovulate. And since you have two ovaries, they might release hours to a day apart and so that 24 hours should maybe be 36 or 48 to be absolutely 100% safe.\n\n\nThen day 24-28 angry PMS body getting ready for a period once it realizes no baby. \n\n\nThat is based one one single (or double) ovulation on a 28 cycle length. Which is what a lot of people thought for a long time and the rhythm method is entirely based on.\n\n\nTwo main problems with this. The first is months vs cycles. A cycle can be 21 days to 35 days. That 28 days is average.  So that can be two ovulation cycles in a calendar month with a 21 day cycle aka up to 12 high risk pregnancy possible days. And since stress and diet and exercise can all delay a cycle your cycle length can be 21 days, then 35, then 21, then 26 etc. \n\n\nThe second is that now studies show that women can possibly ovulate up to two or three times a month. Or they have the hormones that show ovulation and maybe not ovulate, so you think you ovulated that cycle already (based on hormones/peeing on a strip)  when your didn't fully ovulate and release an egg yet. So those test strips that make you think you ovulated and are safe..... Not as risk proof as people thought. Also this can prevent women from getting pregnant because they sometimes stop trying mid month after they think they ovulated, but if was just an incomplete ovulation and so they keep missing their actual ovulation date later in the month. \n\n https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1126506/\n\n\nSo yeah. Maybe the first few days of your period you are safe but the rest of the month is risky time. So if you don't want to get pregnant take and use birth control, there are lots of different options. \n  \n\nAnd if you want to get pregnant, pee on more ovulation sticks, even after you think you ovulated already because bodies are unpredictable especially when stressed.",

It can vary, but statistically, it's most likely to be on that day. The egg survives between 24 and 48 hours, than dies. To get pregnant, the eggs needs to get in contact with sperm during those days, whether the sperm was there before the egg dropped or the women has sex during the ovulation days. The sperm can live up to 5 days in the womb, but only under some conditions. The most likely scenario in which women get pregnant is when the sperm is deposited in the women the day before ovulation. \n\nThe fertile period lasts just 48 hours. Women can track it accurately with ovulation test, from the drug store, or by keeping a log of their temperature. It will raise slightly just before ovulation and will drop right after. Some women also can feel their ovulation. \n\nSome people may have gotten pregnant during their period or others days of their cycle, but it is highly unlikely. Most doctor will tell you that it's probably because people are bad at tracking periods and remembering which day they had sex. For a pregnancy to happen, we need the ovule, the sperm AND some lining in the uterus. Within days after the egg is fertilized, it needs something to grap into, which is called implantation. If the egg fails to implant, there will be no pregnancy. Medication, fever or illness, caffeine and alcohol consumption, spas and warm bath are also known to affect chances of a successful pregnancy. \n\nSex ed is made to scare teenagers, not to educate them about sex and conception. It's easier to talk about the high risk of pregnancy than to expect teenagers to track periods and ovulation, to remember to take pills amd wear condoms. 10% of couples suffer from unexplained infertility but about 80% of people actively trying to get pregnant will be successful within a year.\n\nI'm F40 yo and I have been  unsuccessfully trying to conceive for years.

            "Ovulation causes extreme horniness and we seek out sex those 6 days",
            "I don't ovulate at the \"usual\" 14 days into the cycle I'm fertile immediately after my period. Others may make the assumption they fall within that 2 weeks and not all do. I found out by failing to fall pregnant for 2 years. A few months of ovulation strips and a lot of confusion later, I got pregnant a few months later.",
            "It's a biological drive. When you're body is fertile and ready to be pregnant that is when your sex drive is at its highest. It's basically your body screaming at you to get pregnant! This is when one night stands will be at their highest and also when the risk of pregnancy is highest.",
            "According to my last partner the urge to have sex also increases during the time when she could become pregnant. It is almost like it evolved that way.",

            "When I first met my husband we had been together 8 months, always used protection yet discovered I was pregnant anyway. Fast forward 2 and a bit years I had a night out with the girls, came home drunk as hell and \u201csurprised\u201d my husband, was the one time we ever had unprotected sex and 9months later our son was born. It\u2019s happens. Because of this, and I already had 2 kids from my first marriage, I didn\u2019t want to risk a 5th so I got sterilised. If I get pregnant again I\u2019m gonna go nuts!",
            "I was on birth control and still managed to get pregnant",
            "A woman's body and cycle changes all the time, a lot of times outside factors such as stress, illness, medication, birth control, can all change the days woman can get pregnant. Nothing is set in stone when it comes to the human body and even less so in a woman's body.",
            "Condoms are not effective if you use them improperly and most people have shitty sex education. Also, people think pulling out is effective, but some people leak more pre-ejaculate than others. \n\nFurthermore, some people are just super fertile. I had a friend who got pregnant despite being on birth control because she wasn't taking it at the EXACT same time every day. Or if a woman vomits after taking the pill, it might not have absorbed. There are lots of ways.",
            "6 days a month is a 1 in 5 chance. Not great odds when the result is a baby",
            "The problem is that it is extremely hard to tell which 6 days.\n\nA month is 30 days. That is 1/5 of the month. If you have sex on a random day once a month, on average it will take 5 months to get pregnant.\n\nBut as others have said sperm can last for about 6 days. So a 11 day window. That is 1/3 of a month. So on average it will take you 3 months to get pregnant.",
            "Sperm can survive for quite a lot of day's inside the woman, to its closer to two weeks",
            "it might technically only be 6 days a month, but that doesn't necessarily mean that you'd only get pregnant if you have sex on those 6 days. sperm can stay swimming around for a week at the most, so it's possible that it would happen from having unprotected sex the week before you can technically get pregnant. sperm are also not especially efficient swimmers, so it takes them a few days to get to their destination even if you had unprotected sex during those 6 days. \n\nplus, a lot of people don't have regular cycles. you could think you're having unprotected sex well before you can get pregnant, but surprise! you're actually a week early so you're pregnant now. i think most unplanned pregnancies are from 1. not using any protection at all 2. using protection incorrectly 3. random chance where you do everything right and you end up in the .1% who correctly use protection and still get pregnant.",
            "Unless you have a super regular period, or are tracking it, most people don\u2019t know when they\u2019re most fertile. \n\nI learnt to tell from my discharge and would tell my husband to go nuts (ha) during that time.",
            "Because it's really 11+ days a month, because sperm can live for 5 days in that general area. Oh and ovulation can occur almost at any time in the cycle, even if it's generally a certain number of days post-cycle.",
            "Its because if you dont use contraceptives youll have to count, but unfortunately its not set in stone, you should use pill/diaphragm or get your partner to wear a condom",
            "Women\u2019s sexual activity peaks during their most fertile times. So I\u2019m taking that means more horny when you can get pregnant. So, they look for the D and obviously get it cuz we men are more than willing participants.",

            "Idk when you find out, let me know.",
            "Birth control methods are not 100 percent. Condoms only prevent like 90 percent of pregnancies, you can still get pregnant while on the pill sometimes (Especially if the dose is off or you are forgetful) a lot of people rely on just pulling out, which is obviously not the best method, and there are many people who just use selective abstainance, which can be fairly effective if done correctly, but only if you actually have a reliable cycle. A lot of accidental pregnancies come out of poor sex ed as well.",
            "On top of what other people have said, 6 days a month is 20% of the time. That's a 1 in 5 chance. It's not exactly hard to accidentally pick a day that has a 1 in 5 chance.",
            "by having unprotected sex during those 6 days per month",
            "Periods can last upto something like 7 days. Sperm can survive in the vagina for upto 5 days. Unless you're super regular in your menstrual cycle, then at best you'll only have a reasonable estimate as to when your fertile days are. There's plenty of room for accidental overlap there.",
            "Others have had good answers, but I\u2019d like to add that sex isn\u2019t a cut and dry, get pregnant then or not at all kind of deal. The sperm will stay active inside the woman for days, effectively almost doubling that window",
            "Mostly comes down to... Its hard to kno when those days are.",
            "It can actually be a little bit more of a window than 6 days. Sperm can live for 5 days so even if you limit the sex during those 6 days, you could still have sperm that's alive and ready to do its job.",
            "Sperm can live in a vagina for up to a week",
            "There are a lot of factors:\n\n* Poor sex education, or just lack of knowledge: Not knowing how easy it is to get pregnant, not knowing how to use protection, not being aware of fertile days, and not knowing how to track them. \n\n* Poor access to birth control.\n\n* Imperfect use of birth control (often without realizing it)\n\n* Imperfect cycles: one woman's fertile days might be perfectly 2 weeks after the first day of her period, while another's might be *during* her period.\n\n* Longevity of sperm: sperm can live in a vagina for ~5 days\n\n* Birth control having a failure rate: condoms fail 3% of the time with perfect use and 12% of the time with typical use; the pill fails .3% of the time with perfect use but 9% of the time with typical use. It is naive for one to think they will use their form of protection perfectly, so it's usually smarter to use condoms in addition to a medical birth control method\n\nI think these points were already covered well for the most part, but I wanted to summarize them and throw in my two cents.\n\nOh and quick edit to add: Planned Parenthood refers to the idea of tracking your fertility as 'Fertility Awareness Methods', which are 76% to 88%, depending on the method and how well you implement it.",
            "It's just more likely those days.  Not impossible other days.",
            "I did a presentation on this, it's very inconsistent, it depends from women to women there are ways to predict, ranging from seeing if the vagina, has the slimy oil(I don't remember it that well ok) or even checking temperature, but nothing tells in an absolute way, since it depends from person to person, I remember that was a technic that consisted in taking the dick off before ejaculation but the success rate was 70% because the pp ejects liquid with sperm, even before the big bum bum.",
            ">I\u2019m a girl in my early twenties and have just found out about this\n\nI mean you kind of answered your question there. People don't know how pregnancy and fertility work so they think all sorts of weird stuff.\n\nAlso, do you know which 6 days might be your fertile days? \n\nThere are people who rely on this as their primary birth control method and it's extremely unreliable.",
            "It's pretty hard to nail down those days. Average ovulation is on day 14 but everyone could be different. So let's say you really ovulate on day 11 and since sperm can live so long after sex you could have sex on day 7 or 8 thinking you are fine since it's far away from day 14. And then any other combination of circumstances like that. You have to track ovulation with tests and temperature to actually know when your fertile window is.",
            "They don't know which 6 days.\n\nAnd as my father put it in one of the three jokes that constituted my entire sex education from him:\n\n\"What's the problem with the rhythm method?\"\n\n\"Too many people are off beat.\"",
            "Sex",
            "If you add the 3-5 days on average sperm can live in the vagina on either side of those 6 days, that\u2019s closer to half the days in a month.  And periods/ovulation can vary month over month.  Mother Nature ain\u2019t fn around",
            "You know how you forget you have buns in the oven?\n\nThat x 28 = oo(p)s.\n\nMost woman know all this.

            "Which 6 days are those exactly? The odds of taking a bullet from a revolver (1 out of 6) are less than getting pregnant every month (1 out of 5). And who wants to play Russian Roulette?",

            "People really just be out here fuckin like that.",
            "There are little test strips that you can use to find out exactly which days you'll be fertile. I did them every single month for a year.  Turns out that even if my period was fairly regular, the days I ovulated weren't.  There was even a month I ovulated 5 days later than expected.  Stress and colds really change things up.",
            "Sperm can stay alive in your body for about 5 days. So even if you have sex and it's not necessarily that 6 day window, the sperm can still be in there later on when that window comes around. Also, there are a LOT of sperm in there lol",
            "I don\u2019t intend to speak for women here, but I would assume it\u2019s hard to figure out the 6 days",
            "Semen can live in the cervix for up to five days. So even if you\u2019re having sex three days before you\u2019re ovulating you could still get pregnant . Plus lost people don\u2019t know what days they\u2019re ovulating on",
            "I've read that \\~ half of pregnancies are unplanned. I think a lot of people would be a whole lot happier if this wasn't the case.",
            "Because guys don\u2019t know how to pull out",
            "While there is a 6 day fertility window, it doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t get pregnant on other days. There is never a 0% chance of getting pregnant on other days. You can get pregnant from period sex even, although it isn\u2019t as likely. The fertility window is just when you\u2019re most fertile, not the only time you can get pregnant. You can get pregnant before and after this window too.",
            "Other than not using protection, this happens when a woman\u2019s period cycle is not regular (more than 28 day cycle) because the \u201cfertile\u201d period is not certain or cannot be pinpointed",
            "So, 20% of the time you fuck you can get pregnant. That's true whether you have sex once a year or twice a day. How difficult is that to figure out?",
            "You\u2019ve got to know when you\u2019re ovulating to avoid those 6 days, and a lot of things can throw off the timing of ovulation (illness, stress, erratic use of hormonal contraception), plus a lot of people have really irregular cycles, so ovulation is hard to predict. But if you\u2019re having sex twice a week, which seems like a pretty reasonable average in a relationship, you\u2019re gonna land on one of those 6 days, so\u2026. I\u2019m a midwife, i know for a fact that lots of people just do nothing to prevent pregnancy.",
            "One thing that most people miss and I didn't see as top comment is that the pre-cum could contain sperm, meaning you could get pregnant from raw sex even if the guy pulls out on time. Always use a form of protection. Two even.",

            "That's a general kind of thing. Just like woman generally have 28 day cycle. Some run 40 to 50 days some run 23 days.  Sometime people have birth control problems. Some people drop multiple eggs. Some people have erratic cycles due to hormones or menopause.",

And, they're allowed to lie, too. \n\nThey need one of these things to get in:  \n - your consent  \n - a warrant  \n - probable cause and exigent circumstances  \n\nIf they really want to get in your house, they'll need to explain to a judge why they think they should be legally allowed to do it.

You don't have to let them in (see above unless warrant). You do NOT have to talk to them beyond telling them your name/dob basically. You do not have to stay and listen to them ask you questions or talk to you unless you're under arrest (in which case you don't have to talk beyond identification -- you can simply request a lawyer and say you're not talking without one).\n\nAll that said, if they have reasonable suspicion of a crime occurring they can come in.

Even if they don\u2019t find anything, nothing will happen to them. Most of the time, police will ask \u201ccan I search your car or house\u201d and you can tell them not to.

            "The answer is a qualified no. Unless they have a warrant or probable cause then they have as much right to stand on your property as any other private citizen. You are well within your right to insist they show reasonable probable cause or present a warrant. \n\nThat is your perspective, the police perspective is a little different. The police are allowed, and it is mostly their job, to ask many questions. You don't need a warrant or probable cause to ask questions. They will often threaten arrest just to get you to comply so they can move on to do whatever they need to next. It is exhausting to deal with the general public and it isn't like American police are known for getting the best and the brightest to do the job. If you are threatened with arrest, call their bluff, dollars to donuts they detain you and then release. For police can arrest for many things, but the prosecution is up to the district attorney. Plus, arresting is a PITA and screws up your schedule.",

Of course reddit lives for the thrill of encouraging you to pull out your mini-book constitution real time during your arrest, because they are at home - eating fudge covered oreos' living through you.",

In TN if an officer has reason to believe someone is in danger or in need of immediate help they can enter without a warrant. \n\nAs a police officer I\u2019ve only had to do this once.

            "Apple says its for the environment but they also just said the main reason during the presentation of the 12 which was the first not to come with the brick (and then they took it out of older models they had as well) the reason was that it shrank the box by about 30% and as such could ship 30% more iPhones per pallet on a plane. So to ship the same amount of iPhones technically it is saving CO2 emissions but its negligible in the grand scheme of things.\n\nAlso the phone does come with a lightning to USB-C cable (used to be lightning to USB-A) and so you should have a device of some sort that can power it. If you have no USB-C chargers yes thats a problem but there are also a million third party adapters you can get and thats what most people ended up doing before this switch. I bet if you did a user survey of how many people use the same power brick that came with their phones it would be pretty small. Speaking only for myself I would chuck those little power bricks in the trash once getting a new iPhone, I dont need it, its only 5 watts, and I have more powerful chargers sitting around. To me its just added waste and I  can reuse my others. For first time buyers sure thats a problem but a very minor one. Remember that you can also wirelessly charge the phone if you happen to have one of those sitting around.\n\nMaybe some day they will switch to USB-C.

They also know 3rd party chargers are hit or miss so they also get to sell you a charger.\n\nIt's easy to look for who to blame but there is no one to really blame, companies react to consumer behaviour, and in this specific case you are showing why they do it, you bought the phone either way. Why would they give you something that cost them money that won't affect your purchase behaviour.

There are others who suffer greatly. It\u2019s a functioning country in the real world \u2014 not a cartoonish hell-hole full of torture porn.\n\nAnd so we shouldn\u2019t be surprised to learn that there is laughter, love, ambition, achievement, loss, fear, pain, sadness, or anything else common to the human condition happening there.\n\nTours to the DPRK show the highlights, as you might expect a state-sponsored tour of a country to do. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s entirely white-washed \u2014 it\u2019s not a country-sized play-act for the benefit of tourists.\n\nKorean guides can and do discuss issues the country faces, including food instability, the effects of their isolationist (not necessarily a bad word there) policies, their reputation in the wider world, etc. Instances of poverty are visible on some tours, and I\u2019ve never experienced excuses being made for this. It\u2019s a fact of life in a country like the DPRK.\n\nIn more recent decades, the leadership of the country has been much more forthcoming about the challenges they face. Just recently, KJU stated that the country is in a fairly bad position. He also recently admitted that his previous multi-year plan for economic development had failed to meet its goals.\n\nIf you actually pay attention to the country, you\u2019ll find that the days of \u201cthis is the greatest place on earth\u201d style propaganda are part of the distant past. Koreans don\u2019t think that, and the propaganda within the country has shifted away from the obviously untrue and towards something much harder to combat \u2014 a \u201cwe struggle, but it\u2019s ultimately worth it\u201d kind of message.\n\nAs for what any given Korean thinks the rest of the world thinks (or whether or not they care), you\u2019d have to ask them. But I\u2019ve seen no evidence of them being ignorant to how they\u2019re perceived, and there seem to be conscious efforts being made in recent years to rehabilitate that reputation.\n\nUnfortunately, a lot of the world is still swirling in the rhetoric of the 90s and early 2000s.",

The Air Force ran out of targets and moved on to bombing dams and destroying its best agricultural land. There really was nothing left. \n\nMeanwhile, the war never ended. There was only a provisional ceasefire. The US and ROK militaries regularly play war games that are a dress rehearsal for an invasion of the north. It\u2019s reasonable for the DPRK to fear a second annihilation. Add to this the fact that extremely harsh economic sanctions prohibit the DPRK from importing much needed food and medicine, or participating in the world economy at all, and it\u2019s no surprise that you have a regime that feels it has no choice but to clamp down hard on the population and put all its resources into arming itself to deter an invasion, and above all, to project an icy facade of strength and determination. \n\nIf the world wanted North Korea to introduce something like market democracy, step one would probably be to relax sanctions and allow them to enter into trade. \n\nPeople might not be into this, but it seems to me that the big reason that those sanctions will never be lifted is because, once relations with the DPRK were normalized, the US would have no excuse to keep 88,000 troops stationed in Japan and South Korea, so close to China. The US would have to either hugely escalate tensions with China or withdraw, ceding military hegemony over the region. \n\nIn other words (TL;DR) the DPRK is fucked, and Kim\u2019s regime is doing exactly what you would expect any regime to do in that position. \n\nPS Always gotta return to that cliche about doing the same thing and expecting different results.

So they become locked in a kind of adolescence that has to be deprogrammed so they can even speak about it without the bias that has been drilled into them since birth.  \n  \nWhile the ppl are largely unaware of how they appear to the world, they are also largely powerless to organize a resistance if they were.  \n  \nBut what about the ppl in power? They are all trapped by the system they are participating in. Show any weakness and there are 100 ppl scheming to take your position of privilege and power. Not only are they aware of how they appear to the world, the upper echelon elites often indulge in the culture and pleasures they decry in their enemies around the world.  \n  \nSo, why don\u2019t the free countries of the world do something about this oppressive regime? Because they can and will destroy many many lives, and at this point, the culture of N Korea has largely diverged. It\u2019s an almost impossible puzzle.",

            "Having lived in Republic of Korea and walking visiting the 38th parallel it\u2019s a surreal feeling. I\u2019m not into spiritual healing stones and energy and what not. But being up their, you definitely feel the tension between the two countries. \n\nTheir is always ROK soldiers present. Half obscured by buildings in a modified fighting position constantly waiting, with US soldiers waiting as well.\n\n\nThe small building off of the right is their talk room. ROK soldiers have to open the door and cling to each other. There has been times in the past, that when they opened the door, a ROK solider has been kidnapped. \n\nThe fake village across the river has loud speakers that play soft sleep inducing music and sometimes they\u2019ll bring out industrial size fans and point them skyward and throw propaganda into the air flow and it\u2019ll get caught in fences and  the ROK/KATUSA and US soldiers have to pick it up and off the fences, turn it in. It\u2019s usually saying that they should abandon their post and join their country. \n\n\nThere is reason to believe that in there are hundreds of sleeper agents in South Korea. \n\n\nBack in 2002 when I was there when Kim Jung-il was their leader. It was to be believed that if North Korea were to attacked, the DMZ would be wiped out in minutes and that North Korea could have total control of South Korea in a few short hours and if he wanted to, instead of giving up ground. He would launch chemical and biological weapons polluting the peninsula for decades. \n\n\nAs many people don\u2019t know the war is still being \u201cfought\u201d to this day, it\u2019s the longest war to date, and the reason I say \u201cfought\u201d no official peace treaty has been signed just a cease fire, and cease fires don\u2019t count as a treaty as the fighting can ignite any given time. \n\n\nAnd when I see any propaganda or anything showing the \u201cgood\u201d of DRPK I laugh. I know it\u2019s bullshit, and it hurts knowing that they\u2019re are good people suffering and dying due to a narcissistic, self absorbed fucktard. \n\n\nBut there are people who don\u2019t know and surprisingly a lot of the younger generation of South Koreans don\u2019t really know, how North Korea is, many of them don\u2019t know why the US has military bases there and how fast their life can change if Kim Jung-un decides to cross that border.",

            "[The mole](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt13243898/) is a danish documentary, in 3 parts. It probably is greatly underrated in the rest of the world. \n\nA Danish guy succeeded to infiltrate some of what goes on around in the weapons trading deals on the black market between North Korea and some of the elites from different countries that are secretly trading and doing businesses with high standing personnel from inside the dictatorship.\n\nI will highly recommend anyone who are able to find it, to watch it.",
            "Turn this question to any country. It doesn\u2019t matter what is happening until someone does something about it. Our own counties have dark sides, until we stand up against our oppressors, people around the world will not stand for their freedoms. We humans look to others for courage and strength.",
            "So, North Korea is a pretty complicated topic. I think it's important to note that propaganda is being used on both sides. While theirs is much more obvious, ours tends to be more subtle and I think arguably that might be worse. \n\n\"Why try to make your country look good if everyone already knows how bad it is? \"\n\nI mean, regardless of what country you are, you always want to look good in front of other nations. There's a reason why there are tourist areas and when friends or family come to visit from other countries, you show them the nice parts of the US. You don't take them to a prison to show off that we have one of the highest incarceration rates in the world or take them to a crime scene to show off the gun violence that the US is known for. North Korea just puts in a lot more effort because of their global status. They probably think that they can't show any weakness for any aspect of their country and so they go to ridiculous lengths to show off.\n\n\"Do they just not know that we know?\"\n\nI'm pretty sure at some level of government they are aware. But chances are that the regular people that are roped in are not as aware and are instead told to look good in front of the enemy. Keep in mind that they still see the US as enemies and when they see American tourists, they probably don't want to show any bad aspects of North Korea because it would be humiliating. \n\n\"Will they just refuse to admit it?\"\n\nWell for those who are aware, admitting it is probably going to land you in one of their re-education camps so you're probably not going to admit it. For most of the populace, they're probably generally unaware. They've been told that the rest of the world is way off worse than North Korea and they probably don't have much reason to doubt it. You can see similar cases to a lesser degree when you read history books from different countries. They'll change their own country's history so they look better and the people that are educated under that system have no reason to doubt it. Again, North Korea probably does it to a much greater degree, but it's not something that is unique to North Korea only. \n\nI think it's great that you have questions about North Korea and I think research is always good. You just want to be careful though, information we get about North Korea tends to be curated and may not really always be as truthful as we would like it to be. Shin Dong-Hyuk is one example, he wrote his experiences in North Korea but than later retracted some of his own statements.",
            "It's for the sake of indoctrination of their own citizens. Any \"truth\" they're somehow exposed to is just foreign propaganda. Clean image and a perpetual threat of the enemy, these tactics aren't anything new or exclusive.",
            "Remember watching that Vice video, they interviewed some guy sitting on a computer in a library I think and he had coincidentally just published his breakthrough scientific paper. Vice was lucky to capture that moment.",

            "If you ever wonder how a group of the citizens can willfully injest propaganda which is obvious and ridiculous to everyone else,  and literally still worship a dictator who lies shamelessly about his own actions, and fucks them over at every chance,  just look at the last 4 years in the US.",

Just on steroids. \n\nI\u2019ve probably been in about 60 countries and there is a boring predictability of the people there.\n\nIf you think that of course they should rise up because they are being lied to then I don\u2019t think you understand how human psychology works. \n\nFor every example you give about how brainwashed they are I can give you equivalent examples in the \u201cfree\u201d world.

This happened EVERY. DAY. starting and ending at the exact same time. That was this one guys entire job. He said it was the funniest and weirdest fucking thing he'd ever seen in his life.",
            "You\u2019re not gonna get any good answers here. Fact of the matter is North Korea isn\u2019t as bad as westerners try to make it out to be. It has plenty of flaws, of course, but the flaws must be portrayed honestly if you want to understand them.\n\nYou can get tours of the DPRK yourself and see for yourself, like you said there is strict rules but you\u2019d be surprised at how lenient and breakable the rules are. I would simply say not to watch high budget \u201cdocumentaries\u201d on North Korea, watch people actually go there and explore. \n\n[Some Chinese students exploring Korea](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLegd4KP36a0Y775Xl_HI_tvDKB6qoxPrx)\n\n[Getting haircuts in North Korea](https://youtu.be/2BO83Ig-E8E)\n\n[Western travel channel goes to Korea](https://youtu.be/HbuZlTBpC7I)\n\nJust keep in mind, the DPRK is not all policemen shooting dissidents, just like the US is not all policemen kneeling on peoples throats. There is good and bad, and to understand if the country is becoming worse or better, you need to understand both sides of the problem.\n\nAnd keep in mind, the Koreans really do not care what you think about their country. They\u2019re not putting on a show for you and pretending, because why would they do that? As you said, the whole world already thinks a certain way of them no matter what they say.",

            "North Korea is like practically nowhere else. Some random facts:\n\nThe average North Korean is dirt poor and struggling to survive. Their access information is severely constrained. They can only view DPRK-approved information, and that all tells them that their country is the best, the USA is the enemy, and they are literally under attack. Keep in mind the amazing fact that *the Korean War never ended.* An armistice was declared.\n\nEveryone in the country who has a mobile phone or computer can only access the state-approved intranet. There are only a couple of scientific or educational institutions that can access the internet, and that is supervised. All North Koreans operate under the assumption that their devices are completely accessible by the authorities at all times.\n\nYou can't call outside the country.\n\nYou can be severely punished for hacking your AM radio to receive stations other than the government-approved ones. There are raids to catch people watching illegal DVDs or USB thumb drives.\n\nIf you manage to escape from the country, your whole family might end up in a work camp.\n\nIn short, if it's your job to escort foreigners around the country and you fail to show them only the approved good stuff and let them take illegal pictures or see unpleasant stuff, you will at the LEAST lose your relatively amazing job.

I would 100% double check to make sure that he realized how much he handed you. Individuals with Downs are often very kind and it's possible he knew it would make you happy but didn't realize the repurcussions of his kindness. i.e. Not having grocery money or money for that cool day trip he has planned for the week with his family or care providers. My brother has done similar things like this before without fully understanding what he is doing (he typically struggles with math as well) despite him being considered very high functioning.\n\nTLDR; Double check with the individual, it's impossible to know if he realized what he was doing. If he did; awesome for you. If not; you may have ensured that he has food this week.\n\nEDIT: Wow! Thanks for the kind words, awards and upvotes! I'm pretty new to reddit, so you guys made my day!",

He totally may just have money and be a generous tipper.\n\nAnyone who gave me a tip like that, esp folded so it's not obvious, who didn't give some indication they knew they were doing it , I'd check back. That he may also have a disability would just make it feel more necessary.",
            "I mentored an adult with Down Syndrome.  He spoke well and was good with reasoning/ planning. \n\nHowever, **he never learned how to count money**.  He figured he'd slide his pre-paid visa debit card for the exact amount, or the cashier would give him change if he paid with cash.    \nHe understood the concept of tipping, and would **want to tip appropriately**, but the numerals on rectangle pieces of paper meant nothing to him.   \nHe depended solely on trusting the amount of change provided. \n\nWhat would you do if your customer had paid with a paper crane $5?  Would you assume he knew the value of money and expected you to pay the rest for him?",

He paid in Morgan dollars, definitely not normal tender in the early 90's. I tried talking him out of using them but he insisted, even said he had a bunch he was going to take to the bank. He was a regular and would usually come in with his adult daughter. I told him I'd exchange the coins for him, and afterwards I set them aside in the safe. When his daughter was in with him the next time I pulled her aside and told her about it. She said her father had dementia and was getting confused. She said he had a big collection of coins and didn't know about him spending his coins. I went and got the coins and returned them to her. I had already covered the cash for the deposit and didn't feel right keeping the coins. That was 28 years ago and I still remember the look on her face when I gave back the coins. I would have felt horrible if I kept them, and I would have regretted it to this day. I have a lot of regrets in my life, but I don't regret doing the right things i've done.",

            "Am I missing something here? I live in Europe where tipping is more like 10-20% in a restaurant but in what world is it normal to get an $88 tip for delivering a $12 sandwich? I mean a bill with a 100% tip is still only $24 total. Why would someone give more than 600% tip for a fricking sandwich? The fact the customer is differently abled seems almost besides the point.  To accept that much without immediately assuming a mistake had been made and immediately returning with change is weird behaviour. It doesn't sound like the OP has any relationship with the customer (though I am making assumptions here) so there's no reason they would be gifting them so much money as a thank you or as a personal kindness. \n\nHope the OP already went back to the customer and just said hey heres your change from yesterday and left it at that.

Here you go.\" Maybe they will insist you keep the change, maybe they will say thank you and keep all the change. Maybe they will give you a more reasonable tip. Maybe a caregiver will be there when you stop by and help out. You didn't steal or take advantage of them, but you might be able to help them out if they make a big mistake with their money without realizing it. I think it's a win win situation to drop by and be ready to give them their original change. Cheers for posting asking for advice.",

And the internet is full of people who demean retail workers but still want their service (and a discount!). \n\nI guess they consider certain jobs to be lower class and less deserving of respect.",
            "It is hypocritical. People like holding double standards, especially when they are the benefactor of that double standard.",
            "Depends if you are talking about the same person really. Someone dead set against sex work but who pays through the nose for porn is a hypocrite for sure. But a lot of people don't really care either way about sex work, and never *buy* porn no matter how much they may watch. One element could actually be they think sex work is cheap and dirty, but that adds to the thrill of watching porn.",
            "Because there is a public sentiment that sex work is dishonest and immoral. People want to keep up the appearance that they are moral and upstanding citizens, so they demean sex work whilst enjoying the products.\n\nBasically hypocrisy.\n\nedit - Word correction.",
            "When it comes to the difference between porn and sex work, I think it's perception.  The creation of porn happens outside of view... you don't see the people or process in front of you.  It happens \"out there.\"  This allows people to separate themselves from the action.  Prostitution happens in your face.  In your neighborhood.  You can't \"turn it off\" if it happens on your street or in your city.  You are also more likely to see the negative repercussions of sex work because it's happening near you.  Those repercussions exist for both porn and prostitution, but because you are removed from the creation of porn, you don't experience or witness it.\n\nAs to sex work in general, I think the main issue is **consent**.  Consent is really hard to define.  It's a spectrum.  On the one hand, you have children who are trafficked into sexual slavery who cannot consent.  On the other hand, you have professional escorts who are passionate about the work they do and openly choose to do it.  In between that, you have many, many cases where it's hard to define consent.  \n\n * Is an 18 yr old drug addict who engages in sex work to get his/her fix consenting?  Is he/she able to consent?  \n * What about someone who is mentally challenged and homeless and is a sex worker so he/she can eat?\n * What about someone who was sexually abused as a child and because of that has chosen sex work?\n * What about someone who cannot find other work and does sex work to get out of debt or pay the bills?\n\nMy point is that consent is VERY hard to define, especially when it comes to sex work.  This is not limited to sex work.  You can say the same thing as high-risk work such as mining.  The difference is the intimacy of sex work.\n\nEDIT: Changed \"Sexy\" Slavery to \"Sexual Slavery\".

I was a dancer,  did some adult modeling and a bit of cam work.  Like many industries, you cannot paint all of sex work with the same brush.  It varies a lot between the different medias and even in the same media between the company/site/photographer etc and even based on the model/dancer/actor's level of professionalism and ability to participate without losing her or himself to drugs/alcohol/self judgment...there is so much to it. \n\nSome sets/clubs whatever are nasty, some directors/photographers/managers are disrespectful assholes, some companies treat their talent like total shit and can be very degrading. \n\nBut there are also some very professional companies or clubs that treat their talent well and with respect and pay a decent wage...it varies.

            "They get off on the sex, not on them being sex workers. That's like saying that people who enjoy thriller/horror movies, or documentaries about real crime and serial killers, but condemn murderers, are hypocrites. (not that getting off on something and deeming it \"good\" is the same thing in the first place, on the contrary. We are taught in childhood to associate sex with immorality, and the feeling of \"wrongness\" with arousal, because we're taught it's taboo and forbidden.)  \n\n\nAlso, carnal pleasures are a separate thing from moral values. A person who drinks a lot of alcohol can still hold values that are against his own actions. As long as he doesn't pretend that he lives up to his own expectations, or judges others by standards he himself can't live up to, that does not make him a hypocrite.  \n\n\nHypocritical would be to watch porn while judging others who also watch porn more than you judge yourself.  \n(And btw, I do not judge people in porn, in the sense that I think that they're somehow \"bad\" or \"lesser\" people. It's just definitely nothing I would EVER want for my hypothetical wife to have done in her past or for my hypothetical daughter/son to do.)  \n\n\nI like sex, looking at naked women, etc. - that does not conflict with my rejection of excessive promiscuity, meaningless sex, selling your body and the devaluation of intimacy.  \n\n\nWhen it comes to people who are downright contemptful towards sex-workers, while also consuming porn - I don't know if hypocritical is the right word, but it's definitely wrong for them to attack and insult sex-workers. It's their body and they can do what and who -ever they want with it.",
            "Are the people getting uptight about sex work the same people who watch and pay for porn?",
            "So, a few reasons:\n\n\\- Historically, sex workers were the 'other woman', taking money/political control from a family.  So, many women looked down on them spitefully.\n\n\\- More recently, since sex is a 'only for puritan reproductive purpose', and women are expected to say 'No' to sexual advances, if a woman is taking money for sex she must be really desperate, and hence pitied.\n\n\\- Even more recently, there is a worry/concern that by encouraging/allowing sex work, you are complicit in the portion of that industry that effectively profits through slaves -- women who are brought to another country and have to have sex or else.  While a very large fraction of women do sex work purely voluntarily, this other side makes people very worried.  Especially for a \"puritan-defined non-essential activity'.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, illegal immigrants doing work in other fields seems to be quite well received, so you should probably sharpen the hypocrisy target ever so slightly.",
            "I'm friends with a number of prostitutes/porn actresses, was roommates with one for a while, and held a job that involved frequent interaction with them and relationships on a personal level.  Someone being a sex worker does not make them lesser on any grand moral level, but it absolutely indicates a number of red flags concerning substance abuse, mental health, and the general traits that relate to lifelong health and happiness.  They are invariably damaged people.  I do not dislike them, but I would absolutely be concerned if a woman I knew expressed interest in sex work or became one.  It is a rapid downwards spiral.  I do not know the outcome of every sex worker, but the ones I've observed so far have been early death vs. 5 fast years of forgotten drug addiction followed by years of quiet desperation, until death.  I'm sure other outcomes exist, but I have not witnessed one otherwise.  This does not make them lesser as people, but recognizing the profession as a red flag is completely valid.\n\nI don't know why people claim this to be hypocrisy.  On a similar and related topic, I do cocaine, but also believe that it causes heart disease and a general lowered quality of life and would not want my children or other people to do it.",

            "Male perspective.\n\nI am against sex work because I believe that its demoralizing and is done mostly by people who don't have much of a choice. Some consider sex work to be empowering but I don't hold that opinion. Sex workers are seen as objects by most who hire them and I think thats very toxic. \n\nPorn is different. Its mutual and both people are getting paid.",
            "it's easier to avoid thinking about the realities of exploitation if you dehumanize all sex workers as 'dumb sluts' or uninformed about their own exploitation, and then you can get off while simultaneously feeling you're morally right. but i don't know anyone who's anti sex work who actually *pays* for porn. it's textbook misogyny imo.\n\nto be clear, sex work is exploitative in the sense that most jobs are exploitative - you sell your time and labour so someone else can take most of the profits. sex work obviously has some aspects that can make it far more exploitative and violent than most labour, and trafficking/sex slavery isn't voluntary so it probably should be categorized differently.",
            "I want sex work decriminalized or legalized. It's their body. \n\nBesides that, I also believe that legal sex work can help thousands of frustrated young men. I think a lot of these men donating to Twitch cam girls and Onlyfans would stop doing that if sex work became legal. The point I'm trying to make is that letting these men release their sexual frustration with a sex worker would allow them to move on with their lives.

It\u2019s not a good choice to do illegal sex work, if you value your safety and sanity.\n\nIf sex work was legal in the USA, and most of the western world, it would dramatically increase the quality of life sex workers have. Government mandates requiring all customers and workers be tested for STDs, disallowing sex offenders and other felons from using the service, as well as providing a safe building the customer goes to rather than a dark alleyway, or some sketchy weirdos house.

There are women who are in that business, even though they don't want. I don't know if going to police would help at it. For those who don't know, MCs are Biker Gangs, e. g. Hells Angels or Bandidos.\n\nHowever, I'm not familiar with this topic, so if there are reasons on why it should still legal, you can convince me. This is just a first impression for me.",
            "I think it stems from the countries puritan way of thinking. Porn is something that can be ignored, dont see it it doesn't exist kind of thing but sex workers are more in your face. Cant deny it when a persons working a corner. Completely hypocritical but that's America for ya.",
            "I think a lot of people see it as a really easy job that makes a lot and get pissed they can't do it. Especially when you are talking about stuff like onlyfans or single person porn. Same thing with game streamers or online stream DJs, seems really easy and makes a pretty penny if successful.\n\nThere's also the other end of sex work like prostitution. Some see it as a lazy cop out for those that don't wanna get a real job, using their body they had at birth for money instead of spending time and money learning and training for a job.\n\nThere is also the terrible history with sex work like human trafficking or poor women needing to do sex work or their family starves.\n\nAnd a smaller point is how some see sex beteeen strangers as an easy way to spread disease, so they look at physically involved sex work as bad for public health.\n\nI think it's fine if there are strict rules for consent and protection, usual testing, laws protecting both sides.",
            "I'm against sex work SINCE I stopped watching porn.\n\nI genuinely think it's one of the biggest problems we face today and what makes it 10x worse is just how normalized and widely accepted it is in everyday society.\n\nSo sex work MIGHT be real work, but I am wholeheartedly against it.",

            "[Disclaimer: Please don\u2019t attack me. This is just my opinion and I am open to discussion but please don\u2019t attack me. I am not trying to be mean or rude!]\n\nI don\u2019t look down on sex work. I believe people are entitled to do with themselves what they want. Having said that, I just don\u2019t understand sex work. Particularly as a \u201cfeminist\u201d thing. \n\nI\u2019ve seen and known far too many who get into the industry for the wrong reasons. For attention, for external validation, laziness, self esteem issues, drugs, etc. Very rarely have I seen it truly be just because someone \u201cloves sex\u201d. Knowing what I know from my studies of psychology, too many people too easily convince themselves that they\u2019re happy doing it when they\u2019re really trying to fill a void. It\u2019s incredibly easy to trick yourself because it\u2019s much harder to admit you went down a path that was unhealthy. And it\u2019s easy to get addicted to the attention and you want to justify that.\n\nAnd then on the topic of sex work being feminist... I literally can\u2019t understand how that could possibly be true. Men have exploited women\u2019s bodies for centuries. Porn was literally created by *men*. Sex work was created by *men*. Yes, they\u2019re paying for you but you are still literally giving them what they want. They were paying for it long before this \u201csex work positivity\u201d movement that seems to be happening. It is 100% anti-feminist from my perspective. You just can\u2019t expect respect from an industry that was never built on it in the first place.\n\nPlus, it\u2019s not at all sustainable long term since the sex industry is built on youth or the perception of youth. Putting all your eggs into one basket without considering your late future is reckless. As a side hustle that makes more sense but as your main career, it\u2019s just not sustainable.\n\nIf someone genuinely really loves sex and isn\u2019t trying to get external validation and fill a void, then more power to you. It\u2019s just not the norm that I\u2019ve seen. Cognitive dissonance sadly does run strong in the industry and it makes me very sad. Women are worth so much more than just their bodies.",
            "I think if porn didn\u2019t exist in the way it does today on the internet (free and widely available) I wouldn\u2019t have consumed it. Because of it being free and widely available, porn has incredibly low value to people so it really wouldn\u2019t matter to the people who are against sex work but want to rub one out really quick and move on, because that\u2019s all they see it as. It\u2019s a pretty detached experience, and they don\u2019t care about the people involved so they can take advantage of it being free.\n\nI\u2019m against sex work in the same way that I\u2019m against hookup culture. I think a majority of the time, people in low points of their lives engage in it because they\u2019re desperate and want to fill a void despite the dangers towards mental health, for both the producer and the consumer. There\u2019s so many pornstars who hate what they\u2019ve gone through and regret the decisions that they\u2019ve made and after retiring they realize that it wasn\u2019t worth it despite having been groomed into thinking that the porn world is a glamorous one, while consumers either battle addiction or suffer from some sort of depression and only fall deeper into that pit through their masturbatory habits because they use it as a coping mechanism. I would rather just see the sex industry come to an end.",
            "Because many people get addicted to it. Its like cocaine, people say it's bad and are against it but some people still do it, it's similar to that\nTheres a lot of ways people get hooked onto porn, for example sex scenes in movies; people often watch those and then get urges but they cant satisfy themselves so they turn to porn. \n\nThats my take on it, you're welcome to disagree",

            "This might rustle a few jimmies but here it goes.\n\nThose that abolished slavery in the west, owned slaves.  They were hypocrites too but they ended up moving society in a more equal and moral direction, the full force of those actions really beginning to bare it's fruit only today after a long period of social re-programming.\n\nWhen it comes to sex work, no matter how you spin it, is mostly an exploitation of men when it comes to customer.  On the other hand it's the exploitation of women by their handlers or pimps, men or women.  There is the saying 'prostitution is the oldest profession' which if you really think about it, just isn't true.  If you've ever read history books, you'll know that victors of war raped the women and children of their conquests.  They didn't pay them, they took it.  Just like some men still do today because they have not evolved beyond these desires and there are many women who play the part of the madam, the accomplice and they groom just as they have been groomed.\n\nIf you spend enough time questioning your own views on porn, sex and what it means, especially on an emotional and spiritual level you'll see that it's destructive to social structure and the progress of human kind.  We talk about how advanced and progressive and intelligent we are, yet we resort and fall back on primal, carnal pleasures rather than becoming more than that.\n\nI've personally struggled most of my life with porn addiction and it's ruined relationships with really sweet women that I still think about to this day.  I could just never put my finger on it until I started reading about it and listening to my intuition rather than being told 'it's normal to watch porn'.  There is a lot I have learned and as with any addiction, relapsing is easy.  I challenge any man to not watch porn or touch themselves for 1 month.  Most men will fail this because society on the whole has a serious lack of self restraint and discipline.  If demand is there, young naive girls will get sucked into a world that is sick to the core of spirit.  I specifically use the word girls aswell because quite honestly you are not a woman at 18, you're still a child with an underdeveloped ego and serious lack of moral compass if you didn't have good teachers or parents/family.\n\nIf anyone here can legitimately be honest and say they'd be thrilled to see their girlfriend, wife, daughter, sister or mother showing their genitals for money and letting depraved men stick part of their body inside them then fair enough.  Though my hunch says that statistically, this would be less than 1% of 1% of the world's population.\n\nAs The Beetles famously sang, 'Money can't buy me love'.  Sex is to be enjoyed, it's a deeply spiritual experience and a great way to develop yourself and a relationship with someone and in some cases maybe with a few people on the same wavelength.  Sex work should be educated against vehemently and real sex and philosophy of sex taught from a more developed, evolved yet ancient spiritual perspective.  As we move through the times, less people will be having children as is already apparent.  Sex is more than pro-creation, let's teach society to have a good time with each other and lift society out of the dark degenerate hole we seem to be falling into, just as with every empire that collapsed shortly after sexual morals of the times were degraded.\n\nWhen you jack it, you are blowing your creative energy to what is literally 1s and 0s controlling liquid crystal with photons firing from behind to produce an image on your screen.  There is no realness, there is no human connection, there is no two way conversation it's just straight up visual, sensual overload that blasts dopamine into your veins ready for you to come back for more.",

It's why people will clown their friends or famous people (idubbbz) is their girlfriends has an Onlyfans. It's why men who sleep around are 'players' and women who do the same are 'hoes'\n\nBut the misogyny is usually internalized, so the people don't even realize their misogynistic.

            "Sex worker here! My best guess is a lot of factors. One being that the illegality of prostitution leads to a stigmatized view of the industry (it\u2019s illegal, so it must be bad).  The second is that sex workers are predominantly female or members of the LGTBQ+ community. These groups typically (especially the LGTBQ+ folks) are less welcome in larger economic markets (women and LQTBQ+ make on average less than men, and when race is taken into account, it\u2019s even more stratified), which is pretty deliberate. When these groups carve out a niche where they hold the economic power (such as by becoming sex workers) it\u2019s threatening to those (men in positions of power) who wish to have these groups subjugated, while still fetishizing them via watching them on porn. You ever notice how the most virulent anti-sex people end up in sex scandals? It\u2019s easier to access porn and sexual images on the internet or wherever and usually can be hidden. Getting a sex worker takes a lot more time, resources  and effort than looking up porn to watch.

It really isn't something that someone can find empowering or look up to you for doing that. Also, porn is not an essential service or something people really value, few people would even admit openly that they watch porn so there's that as well."
