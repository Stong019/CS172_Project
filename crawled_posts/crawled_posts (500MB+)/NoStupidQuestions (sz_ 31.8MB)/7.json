            "The pledge and a moment of silence were standard in my school all the way through 12th grade. In elementary school pretty much everyone recited it and it probably did look culty but I didn\u2019t notice. In high school fewer people recited the pledge but we would get detention for not standing up.",
            "I went to a small Christian school where not only did we pledge allegiance to the American flag every morning but to the Christian flag and the bible as well.",
            "Through elementary school and junior high we did.  So for us that's up through grade 8.  It calmed down in highschool, but that may depend on the area for other people.  Also I graduated in 2005, so it might be different now.",
            "You don't have to recite it. In some parts of America you would be looked down upon in school for not doing it but no one can force you. Supreme Court has ruled on the subject that compulsory pledge of allegiance is unconstitutional. Same with schools who want to require prayer in the morning.",
            "I live in the Bible Belt. They absolutely made us at the schools I went to. We had to stand with the hand over our heart and the teacher would sometimes come around to make sure we were saying it out loud. Hats had to be off, posture had to be straight. One of my classmates had told the teacher they weren't saying it due to personal reasons. Got in school suspension. This was public school too. \n\nThis was in the 90s. Never realized how messed up it was until I met folks who lived outside of the country who were like \"whoa dude wtf\".",
            "Yes, we said the pledge every day before school from kindergarten to 12th grade. Technically (legally) no one can make you say it, and some kids will sit in defiance. By 12th grade almost everyone just stands and no one really says it, they just go through the motions. In elementary school basically everyone says it. \n\nIn elementary school I never felt it was culty. They taught us a lot of good things about our country and I would think about the sacrifices made by soldiers and American heroes and I had pride and respect for the people who built America. \n\nIn middle school when I knew more history I started to realize it\u2019s ridiculously culty and should not be done.",
            "Officially no, we're not required to say it. In practice, through pressure, manipulation, plain ignorance etc. yes, *some* areas do make kids actually say it. Bit of a sore spot for me in fact, because I tried to protest against saying it as a kid and was punished-- even though I wasn't supposed to be forced to say it, I was anyway. When you're a kid, it's easy to take advantage. Teacher tells you you have to, so you do it.\n\nEveryone saying \"no one forces you\" are not acknowledging the reality in many areas of the country. They're not *supposed* to make you say it, that doesn't mean they don't.\n\nI'd like to say that kind of pressure or manipulation tactics or just flatout inadherence to the law wouldn't fly today... but I know it does. I've since talked to some of my former teachers and they boasted about the tricks and loopholes they use in making kids say it.\n\nYes, it's absolutely 100% as culty as it looks.",
            "We did in elementary school, but in high school we just had morning announcements. I think it just varies by state/region/school district.",
            "And to make it more culty the controversial phrase \"under god\" was not added to the pledge of allegiance until 1954.\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2018/06/14/the-gripping-sermon-that-got-under-god-added-to-the-pledge-of-allegiance-on-flag-day/",
            "This restaurant near me stops everything they're doing at 12pm noon every day, the employees all come out from the back, and everyone stands up and recites the national anthem. Weirdest fucking thing.",
            "Yes and yes. Unless you want to be the unspoken class weirdo. This isn't just in the Bible belt, I went to school in the Bronx in the 90s. No you weren't suspended or shot for not reciting it, it's expected just like standing for any national anthem. It never felt culty as kid, just corny but as an adult yeaaahhh seeing through the vail of all the propaganda is cause for cringe",
            "We don't *have* to do anything, it's specifically illegal to face any retribution for not doing it. Many a kid will sit defiantly during the pledge.\n\nYes, it is a thing that is done in U.S. schools - kindergarten through 12th grade - in the morning before the first period. Yes, it does feel a little culty looking back.\n\nOutside of that it's typically done at political rallies and sporting events, not really anywhere else.",
            "As an American who has pointed this out, it\u2019s an expectation more than an obligation. We were made to do it every morning before school began and you would definitely be looked down upon for abstaining. Admitting to the fact that I, personally, consider it to be idol worship has resulted in my family telling me that I hate my country. It is just as culty and creepy as you think and this country\u2019s idea of what \u201cpatriotism\u201d looks like has become seriously skewed.",
            "When I was in school we recited it every day. It was just part of the routine; I didn\u2019t even think about it. There were a couple of kids who didn\u2019t recite it for religious reasons (no idea what they were); no big deal. \n\nNow at my kids\u2019 school they do it once a week (well, pre-covid; now school is online). I told them not to bother saying the pledge unless they want to. \n\nIt is, to me, a completely inappropriate thing to ask kids to recite. I have to promise to be faithful to a piece of cloth, and my country, while invoking God? No thanks. That has no place in schools.",
            "No child can be forced to recite the pledge. In TX I send a letter to each of my kids\u2019 teachers at the beginning of each school year reminding them my kids may choose to opt out of the pledge if they want. I personally ask my kids to not recite the Texas pledge they have here because I think that\u2019s beyond silly to have a kid pledge themselves to a specific state.",
            "It\u2019s worse than that. My school had the pledge of allegiance AND military propaganda that we had to watch every day for 15 minutes after lunch masked in some cutesy \u201cteen news show\u201d. But it was definitely military propaganda, there were about 3 commercial breaks in like a 15 minute piece with a \u201cjoin the military it\u2019s so amazing\u201d ad in between each. \ud83e\udd2e\n\nFYI I grew up in Washington State, so not even a conservative state.\n\nEdited to add: I did not stand for the pledge of allegiance and gave the reason that I wasn\u2019t American \ud83d\ude1d\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f(which was true). People did give me odd looks and sometimes made comments. I was never punished for it by teachers.",
            "You can't legally be forced, but many kids across the country still are. My mother is a teacher, and while she doesn't force her students, it's a required thing her school does every single day.       \n       \nAnd yes, the pledge is absolutely culty as hell.",
            "I grew up in Georgia and we recited it all the way through high school in the mornings. I can\u2019t recall if there was anyone who explicitly got in trouble for not doing it, but I think the teachers wanted you to at least stand up for it if you didn\u2019t want to say the words. Also similar to other commenters, it was coupled with a moment of silence (maybe around 30 seconds or so)\n\nYes 100% very culty but only if you think about it directly. In the moment it felt very normal and routine. Same as listening to the national anthem before sporting events",
            "In elementary school it was done over the intercom and you were expected to do it every day. We were young enough to follow along without question. No they can't force you.",
            "Nepali here. We must compulsoryly stand up for the national anthem in school",
            "You don't *HAVE* to, but most do. You can't be forced to.",
            "Back in the 80's when I was in elementary school we got in trouble for not participating in the pledge. I went to DoDs schools so I can't speak for everyone my age.",
            "When I was a child in 1960s Indiana, every morning in school we would all stand, face the flag, put our hands over our hearts, and recite the Pledge of Allegiance. I don't know how things work in schools these days.",
            "Theyre not alone in this. I had to do it too. Ok techmically i didnt have to but the peer pressure was real.\n\nCountries are dumb, humans are all the same and borders are violence.",
            "I am not American so I cannot answer your question but as someone who lives in Turkey I can talk about reciting the pledge. I think it is kind of cultish because you literally pledge to put the existence of the state above yourself. It feels a kind of nationalistic propoganda to be honest.   \nMoreover, it ends with this exclamation,\n\n>\"My existence shall be dedicated to the Turkish existence. How happy is the one who says \"I am a Turk!\"\n\nFor many years this did not feel off to me; however, I feel conflicted now for I am actually a Circassian. And even though my ancestors came to this region in 19th century (they were exiled from their homeland after the conquest of Russia), The Turk in the pledge had the meaning of the people of Turkey initially; however, many nationalist does not solely think like that.",
            "As a teacher none of my students usually want to, I think it's culty to make them, and it's a fight I'm just not willing to have. As long as they're quiet during announcements I don't care.",
            "Yes. Moreso frequently In the past than present, it\u2019s slowly dying out. \n\nIt stopped all together around freshman year of high school for me, which was 2008/2009. But all throughout middle and elementary school for myself and my sister we had to recite the pledge of allegiance every morning before morning announcements.\n\nMy parents did it up until college, same as my grandparents and assumedly their parents as well.\n\nI\u2019m from the Midwest part of USA.",
            "even more culty than u think it is",
            "I recite it out of respect but I leave out \u201cunder God\u201d",
            "Only in elementary school, and maybe the odd political rally.",
            "Lol I\u2019m 65 and when I was in school we had to stand   Hand over our heart and recite the pledge. Never even thought how culty it was until now! This was the Seattle area.",
            "We don\u2019t have to. I live in Louisiana, but in a more liberal part. Lots of people sit down and nobody says anything. I usually stand and don\u2019t say anything. A lot of people don\u2019t want to do it, like me, but feel like they have to so that the conservatives in class don\u2019t freak out.",
            "LoL, it is accurate. We don't find it weird. It really isn't until you start thinking about it. \n\nNo! Stop! Don't try to think about the EVENT!",
            "As a child of the 90\u2019s, I grew up thinking it was absolutely mandatory. Wasn\u2019t until after 9/11, and I was a senior, that I realized nobody could make me do it, so I stopped. It was my own protest, and I felt it was actually more patriotic to do so. I was harassed by another kid once, but the teacher was a Vietnam veteran and quickly explained to that kid what was what. \n\nMr. Stewart was a hero.",
            "It's exactly as culty as it looks. Nothing is creepier than 5 year olds who can't even read swearing loyalty to their government.",
            "The entire class will turn on you if you dont do it too,  everyone is brain washed.",
            "Yeah, it\u2019s very naziesque",
            "It's prime brainwashing since you are a little kid.",
            "If you go to public schools, yes they pressure you and make it seem like you have to recite it. If you don't you get sent to the principle's office or something.\n\nPrivate schools are different. As far as I know not many of them do the pledge of allegiance. Mt private school was religious so once a week at chapel we recited the school's mission statement and a religious statement. Still just as cult-y as the pledge of allegiance though.",
            "I always wondered if this was just a US things or if other countries did this. I never saw it as cultish or inappropriate. It was just how you started the day.",
            "Yes and yes. I was reprimanded when I didnt want to stand in junior high.",
            "Don\u2019t know what movies you watched but we did stand, place our right hand over our heart, and recite it. Is that cult like? I\u2019ve always done it so it just seems normal.",
            "I actually got sent to the principals office for saying, \u201cOne Nation under science, with liberty and justice for all.\u201d When you add that bit I actually enjoyed saying it, because I believe in the idea of a country where everyone can live freely in the way that makes them happiest, I also wish I lived in a country where justice was served when and where it is needed but that\u2019s not the case, it\u2019s just an ideal that we fail to hit.",
            "My senior year of high school They tried to force me to do it even though they new it was my first year in the U.S and held citizenships in other countries. Lol. I told them that I couldn\u2019t do it as I am not willing to die or pledge my allegiance to a country run by a bunch of billionaires. I ended up just using the bathroom every day at the same time to not have to deal with that craziness. Also I don\u2019t hate the U.S just to be clear. I do what is in my power to make my city better but the pledge of allegiance is a little to far for me.",
            "I grew up in louisiana... It was mandatory... They would suspend you for the day if you had the right teacher, and they would label it as a disrespect suspension... I was born in 1992 just so you can get a picture of how recent that was",
            "I\u2019m in the western US and we don\u2019t do it.",
            "Grew up in California. I recall reciting it in school probably up until 4th grade (private school) which would have been circa 1988. Honestly I don't even remember the words anymore.",
            "Its real. By law they can not force students to do the pledge, but Ive had quite a few teachers who made us",
            "Yeah, they'll try to force you into saying it.  They'll definitely turn their peer pressure up 100%, including shaming or threatening you after if you don't.  The religious fantatics will fully shout out \"under gawd\" as loud as they can for that part which was added in a fit of religious lunacy.\n\nYeah, it's totally as creepy as you would expect.",
            "I come from a military family and we lived on bases growing up. We not only had to recite the pledge of allegiance, but also were required to sing \"My Country Tis of Thee\" afterwards.",
            "Yes and yes. Had to recite it everyday of elementary school, but after that, no one really gave a shit about it. \n\nBeing an atheist, the \"under god\" part always made me uncomfortable as a kid, so I left it out.",
            "Yes. To be honest though my gripe is not with the pledge of allegiance itself, but the words \u201cunder god\u201d which were added decades after the pledge was written during the height of the Cold War to distinguish us Americans from the communists hiding under the bed. \n\nThe separation of church and state is one of those things where America doesn\u2019t match its propaganda and this small example has endlessly annoyed me. \n\nSo while I have no problem with the pledge itself as a daily ritual for schoolchildren, I do wish we\u2019d go back to the original version.",
            "During WW2 a couple of Jehovahs Witness children were expelled from school.  They appealled and initially lost the Supreme Court decision which kicked off a wave of persecution and mob violence against Jehovahs Witnesses.  Some were castrated, tarred and feathered, beaten, hung, etc.  The Supreme Court overturned its decision.  Its a famous case... something like Goebitis vs school board or something.\n\nSo, no we don't have to salute the flag. \n\nAlso, the flag salute was written against by the founding fathers... and was written by a communist.\n\nHave a good day",
            "Back in 2015-2016 I went to a Trump rally. Not because I supported the terrorist, but because it\u2019s important to hear what important people are saying. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing more frightening than hearing 10000 people chanting the pledge of allegiance",
            "In Texas you also have to pledge to the Texas flag.",
            "My kid is in grade school. As we're doing distance learning right now I know that every morning they say the pledge. Then they do a \"mindful minute\" where they sit quietly and think about whatever topic it is that week. Ex: how can I be a better person, what are goals I want to set for myself, how can I work to achieve my goals.\n\nIt's a bit weird when you think about pledging your allegiance to a flag. We should be pledging allegiance to our people. But having grown up doing it it's not super weird in practice.",
            "I\u2019m an American and I think it\u2019s absolutely crazy that we have children stand up every morning and chant their allegiance to the country. I tell my kids that they absolutely do not have to do that.\n\nMost of the kids don\u2019t even understand what they\u2019re saying.",
            "For my social studies class in eighth grade we had to propose and present a \u201cbill\u201d and the class would vote and the teacher would act as the \u201cpresident.\u201d\n\nI decided to remove under god from the pledge of allegiance.\n\nHoooooo boy I did not expect the absolute vitriol from other kids that came from that. People were fucking outraged. Obviously no one had a sensible reason that it should be there, but they were relentless that I was dumb for suggesting it be gone.",

            "When I was a kid my parents would give me gifts from Santa as well as themselves, so it doesn't have to be one or the other. She would also write on other gifts from Frosty the Snowman, from Rudolph, and a bunch of other imaginary christmas characters. My mother even did this long after we stopped believing just for fun.",
            "I know when I was a kid my parents weren't well off at all and loved budgeting so whenever I got a toy or anything it would be something cheap and small. Every Christmas i would say \"Im asking Santa for this because I know it's too expensive\" And \"Santa\" would get at least one of the expenisive gifts and my parents would give me the smaller things. I think it was good so I never became more entitled and expected more from my parents. As some of the other posts said it made things magical because not only the lore of santa but it was the one time of year I could get a toy that I often saw the kids at school with. And once I realized Santa wasn't real it just made the gifts more special.",
            "I always thought it was all a way to get kids to behave. You didn't want to be put on a naughty list",
            "[removed]",
            "I used to think it was magical or just a bit of fun until I started teaching. Every year come January the kids would come in and start talking (sometimes bragging) about what Santa had given them. Sometimes Santa was extremely generous to certain children, others unfortunately not so much. You could see some of the other children who were \"good\" thinking to themselves \"why didn't I get as much as everyone else?\" It was actually a little heartbreaking.\n\nEdit- Santa seems to be a really emotional subject still for a lot of people. My original comment was made quite casually.  I should clarify that I'm not suggesting we cancel Christmas. The issue I have is that we generally feed kids this idea that there is a godlike figure who will pass judgement on how good or bad you are, but then doesn't even follow his own rules, because he gave your bully more gifts than he gave you. I am not in denial that shitty things still happen to good people either. It's a big hot topic in schools right now to help children be resilient and we do that whenever opportunities arise.  But as adults we are in control of how we explain the mythology of Santa and set up whatever traditions we want to follow. Let's just be mindful and show a little empathy while we do so. At our house Santa gives one modest gift and fills your stocking, everything else is from family and friends. I really don't get people's logic that the wound is already there, so what's the harm in a little sprinkle of salt. Trust me, kids know early on where they all sit in the pecking order, all year round. They don't need the added salt.",
            "I never really believed my parents about Santa (I think they made some slip-up really early that I picked up on) but I quite enjoyed buying into the fantasy anyway. It's a fun make-believe thing and I think actually lot of kids enjoy it even though they see through it. Most of what young kids do with their friends is pretending anyway.",
            "I was raised with no Santa. My mom did have to tell me other kids believed in him after I tried to let my best friend in on the secret. Anyway, my parents, the ever weird people that they are, and my aunt (also very weird) came up with a different magical Christmas deity, the Cosmic Christmas Jellyfish, when I was four. I'll explain the CCJ below because Santa probably would have been better. \n\nThe Cosmic Christmas Jellyfish (CCJ for short) live deep below the ocean and sometimes comes out and flies in the sky leaving a colorful goo in his wake that some people mistake for the Northern Lights. He is a giant, colorful, magical flying jellyfish. \nTo receive presents on Christmas you must do as follows:\n1. Clean your room \n2. Leave a pistachio offering out for him \n3. Be asleep. \nIf all of those things are done he will eat the pistachios and poop out your presents. \nIf they are not, however, he will rip you limb from limb, eviscerate you, and leave your guts strewn about your room to be discovered in the morning. \nI had a weird childhood",
            "I think the biggest problem with telling young people there's no Santa is because kids have no filter.  When everyone at school is talking about Santa, they'll blurt out that Santa isn't real, and they'll crush all their classmates.  \n\nI read this once, and I saved it.

He was ecstatic. I had to remind him that NO ONE could ever know what he did, or he wouldn\u2019t be a Santa.  \n>  \n>Over the years, he chose a good number of targets, always coming up with a unique present just for them. One year he chose the daughter of some friends of ours, who were going through some tough times. Christmas for them was looking pretty bleak. With the help of his father, he polished up his bike, put a new seat on it, and with her parents\u2019 permission, placed it on their back porch. The look on her face when she saw the bike with a big bow on it was almost as good as the look on my son\u2019s face.  \n>  \n>When it came time for Son #2 to join the ranks, my oldest came along, and helped with the induction speech. They are both excellent gifters, by the way, and never felt that they had been lied to\u2014because, instead, they were let in on the Secret of Being a Santa.\n\nAs my siblings and I got older, and my older brother and I knew Santa wasn't real while one or both of my younger sisters still did, my mom used to say \"as long as there's a spirit of love in the world, there's a Santa Claus.\"  What this lady did with her kids seems to demonstrate that in spades.  I think she successfully transitioned from the magic of Santa, to the magic of gifting selflessly. and she did so in such a way that the kid isn't going to tell his classmates that Santa doesn't exist.  Because Santa does exist, just within all of us.",

Santa is a massive cultural icon in the western world and IMO our world needs a bit of magic and pretend play. Santa makes me happy, he makes my kids happy and our house happy.

Meanwhile, the increasing collective shift away from theological idealism and towards a materialist rational empiricism, along with the widespread adoption of a heavily neo liberal capitalist zeitgeist underpinned by a post modern form of pseudo-religious worship in brands and consumerism;\n\nThe black booted, red and white suited, big bearded, white haired fat old caucasian man we know as Santa Clause is actually a seasonal brand copyrighted by CocaCola, and the festival as it stands has been co-opted as a mass marketing campaign for businesses to exploit.\n\nThis is generally maintained by furthering the collection of brand symbols, themes and logos as associated with the spectre of what was once a religious festival, channelled through the cultural fabric of yearly seasonal festivities and commodified as the metric shit heap of christmas specific tack and ciche merchandise that sits in an attic for 364 days a year.\n\nAlong with this is the consistent drive, in main part by the increasingly aggressive marketing, to buy as much as possible in some post modern expression of materialist worship, as we express what was once our genuine focus on interpersonal appreciation and common good will, by seeing how much stuff we can give to other people.\n\nThis cultural modus is kept alive like all other religious ideologies, through fable, and characters of fable. Well known to be most effective if indoctrination begins as young as possible.\n\nSo we tell children about santa claus. We do it because its what's done at this time of year in this part of the world. People do the things that other people do because we're social creatures, then through that, the vast corporate interests at the fulcrum of our materialist paradigm get to vicariously feed in to, and off of, our collective desire to fit in.",

Without wondering what's before or after (our personal experience, if we could be there to witness it), I'm interested in the thing from another point of view - how is life created? Cells grow exponentially and the physical aspect of creatures growing is obvious, but what exactly brings the life into the chunks of meat that we animals are?\n\nDeath is a lot easier to grasp. There is life, which then ceases to exist, nothing is forever, yada yada. But new life? Like I said, the physical aspect is easy, we transform and utilize various resources (such as energy) to create the shell, but where does the consciousness come from?\n\nIt sure is possible that our consciousness is literally just a fine tuned mixture of electricity and genetic programming (which is supported by the theories that there's no free will, all our impulses etc are hard coded into our dna). Who knows, maybe we really are just biological computers and creating life is just putting some electricity into that computer to get the 1s and 0s flowing.

            "A radical idea: Abolish the federal minimum wage, as cost of living is drastically different depending on where you live. And instead you incentive strong unions and let the unions and employers negotiate the minimum wage for each branch/company. \n\nIt works quite well here in Sweden, for example a newly employed worker at McDonald's makes a minimum of $15/h between 0600-2000 weekdays and another $2,50/h after that or during weekends. A Big Mac costs roughly $4 at the moment. And for my two bedroom apartment in a medium city cost me $813 monthly including utilities, internet and parking.\n\nThis is because McDonald's is negotiating salary against the union for all restaurant and hotell workers and need to meat their minimum wage.",
            "Well there are rational arguments against this. Raising the minimum wage does put tremendous pressure on companies to raise prices. Take for example a company currently paying $7.50 for 500 employees. If each employee works 36 hours a week that would cost the company $135,000 a week or about $7 million a year. However if this wage was say $15 an hour the company would have to pay double that at 14 million. If the company doesn\u2019t have those funds (a lot don\u2019t) they will be forced to raise prices. Keep in mind these companies also have investors they\u2019re trying to please. This creates more inflation and a continuing cycle of higher wages, higher prices. \n\nNow the government also has to worry about a couple other things, one of them is the fact that a lot of people put their savings into these companies, that includes 55 percent of adults in America which have investments in the stock market. If these companies have slimmer margins and or have to take on debt that could potentially destroy peoples life savings. So it\u2019s not simply a \u201cgovernment sucks\u201d issue.",

            "I asked a similar question about two and a half years ago.\n\nI typed up a long breakdown of options that I thought would help. This will be a much shortened version. First I argued that a 15.00 an hour minimum wage was stupid and short sighted. Not for the reasons some would think. I am not some pure capitalist who looks down on those less fortunate, or buy into the myth that people should not deserve a living wage. There are realities though that are undeniable. In my State I can buy a nice house (even now) for under 120k dollars including land. You can rent an entire house for 400.00-700.00 in a decent neighborhood. Moderate to low taxation, plenty of employment, and I live in one of the best cost of living areas in the country. 9.00 an hour here is close to 18.00 in the coast. Paying someone here 15.00 an hour would put them in equivalent spending value to 25.00-30.00 in many places. This creates all sorts of issues on the backend and in other places. It\u2019s also not fair to people on the coast as in many places 15.00 an hour isn\u2019t close to being a living wage, and out here it\u2019s far more than enough. Average countrywide the math comes to 11.00 an hour for the equivalent to when it first started. But places in the Midwest heavily skew the average. By trying to fix this there are a litany of potential issues including inflationary reaction. No, it hasn\u2019t been seen everywhere where it\u2019s happened but when you balance the entire market with it\u2026 most experts agree it will have some effect. My idea for a solution was why not have computer modeling, and what not (every major intra-state employer already has these systems in place) for a regional cost of living calculator. Minimum wage should be automatically adjusted year in and year our based on a formulation including inflation and cost of living calculations. This would stop companies from gaming the system, reduce inflation, and ensure parity in purchasing power coast to coast or as close as it could ever be. Then places like Seattle where you should make 18.00 an hour to get by, and places like Indiana aren\u2019t having such disparities in adjusted PP.",

I'd be willing to bet there's been much ink spilled regarding how advertisers can get as close as possible to this threshold without crossing it.

            "Answer: I'm a marketing student who's dissertation touched on this so can give a bit of background. Here's a slightly edited version of an except from my undergrad dissertation. I apologise for the shitiness of my writing, English is my first language, I'm just a moron.\n\nTLD at the bottom.\n\nWhen you have an over-abundance of advertising bombarding the consumer, much of the content is filtered out or resisted (Rumbo, 2002). Academics have offered a variety of reasons for the phenomenon, and so they require an analysis to determine relevance to online media. Mangleberg & Bristol (1998) posit the socialisation model and that advertising resistance is learned through peer influence and parents. Ha (1996) offers three dimensions of advertising clutter that affect resistance that all require individual analysis: quantity, competitiveness and intrusiveness.\n\nQuantity has been researched extensively by many academics over the past few decades, the vast majority of studies come to the same conclusion: that in the modern age of advertising, consumers are increasingly bombarded with an overabundance of advertising material. So much in fact that consumers are simply not able to process all of it, thus leading to much material being subconsciously filtered out. Also known as overload theory; the effects of the sheer volume of advertising messages directed at consumers has been debated by many academics (Malhotra et al, 1982) (Edmunds & Morris, 2000) (Eppler & Mengis, 2004) (Lee & Lee, 2004). Most agree that an increase in information available leads to better choices, however there has also been some evidence to suggest that an increase in brands may lead to poorer choices. The latter has been further augmented with parallel studies into consumer attention. Known as selective attention theory, Smith & Buchholz (1991) suggest that consumers have limited mental capacity to expend on focussing attention and so will not pay attention to advertisements as they are not seen as relevant, thus, should adverts wish to gain consumer focus, they must stand out as more relevant or important than other adverts. The nature of quantity therefore is somewhat paradoxical for the consumer. The more your own advert is shown, the increased likelihood of consumer attention and therefore retention, however the more adverts trying to achieve this, the harder it is to stand out resulting in less retention. This was later complemented by Ha & McCann, (2008) who demonstrated that increased quantity of adverts leads to consumers forgetting a higher percentage of adverts (recall/retention) and the poorer attitude of consumers towards the media platform. (Riebe & Dawes, 2006).\n\nSince the advent and subsequent exponential uptake of the internet intrusiveness has also been studied in greater detail (Li et al, 2002) (Cho & Cheon, 2004). Li et al defined intrusiveness thus:\n\nIntrusiveness is a perception or psychological consequence that occurs when an audience's cognitive processes are interrupted. Therefore, ads within programming or editorial units are not themselves intrusive, but rather, the ads must be perceived as interrupting the goals of the viewers to be considered intrusive.\n\nThey also found that intrusiveness led to irritation and negative feelings towards the advertisement. This could indicate that the advertisement was not processed by consumers cognitively and that consumers indulge in ad-voidance behaviours as described by Elliot and Speck (1998).\n\nCompetitiveness was defined by Ha & McCann (2008) as the degree of similarity between advertised products and advertising messages in a pod or group. Competitiveness does not appear to have been taken up by the academic world in the same way as quantity and intrusiveness, however it does have some basis within perceptual grouping theory (Pomerantz 1981), where items that are perceived to be similar are grouped together subconsciously and no single item stand outs to the consumer. For example, if you have a magazine with many adverts for watches then it is unlikely you will remember a single watch brand, however if you have a magazine with a single watch advert, a single jeans advert and a single suit advert you are more likely to remember each individual brand.\n\nTl:dryeah, advertising resistance has been heavily studied by academia. Deliberately avoiding a specific advert is known as ad-voidance, we do it subconsciously primarily because adverts intrude on what we were doing, however we can also do it consciously because a particular advert has annoyed us.  \n\n\nEdit: dunno about anyone else but the term ad-voidance amuses me.

My school is structured so that the math and science classrooms are one one side of campus and the english and history classrooms are one the other side with everything else in between. If you're a girl on the english and history side of campus, you might have to walk all the way to the math and science side of campus to use the restroom and vice versa. It also changes every day. I'm guessing this is so they can more easily monitor the restrooms without having to make everyone find a security person or janitor to open the restroom for them, but really all it does is make us walk more.\n\nI hate this stupid trend of kids going around and fucking up all of the school facilities. \n3 classrooms were close for cleaning for 3 days after kids broke in and sprayed everything with a fire extinguisher (one of those was a computer lab/the robotics club which I'm a part of and I would have been so pissed if they had broken our robot). \nOne teacher got all of her stuff stolen from her classroom (not just personal belongings but most of the stuff in her classroom) and she was completely destroyed since she was already having an extremely hard week.\nthe hand sanitizer dispensers in the classrooms are getting stolen and so are the water bottle refilling stations. \nThere's probably more that I haven't even heard about yet.
