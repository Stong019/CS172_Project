            "Yup. Noticed this big time with youtube too. For instance, if I searched \"ducks\" on youtube, the first three results are something duck related, but then the next several results are based off of previous searches I had or vids I may be interested in that may have absolutely nothing to do with ducks. So infuriating. Give me ducks or give me death.\n\n\nEdit: holy duck, this blew up a bit. lol sorry guys, I was just using ducks as an example and am not intensively looking for ducks videos but I appreciate you guys sending 'em my way!\n\nI was just pointing out that youtube is kind of butt when it comes to their searches. Even typing specifically in detail what you're looking for in there brings up a bunch of stuff that may be relevant to the user overall, but not always relevant to what the user is searching in the query. You gotta sift through a lot of \"recommended\" videos to get to the good stuff.",

            "I have noticed it getting worse over the years for just general searches. I don't know if it's them manipulating the information or if it's just people have gotten better at building web pages to make stuff pop up more. It seems like I have to routinely go 3 to 6 pages in to find stuff due to a bunch of the pages being unrelated. Some stuff has gotten better such as putting more reputable results such as Mayo clinic closer to the top. Other times they put really biased politically connected orgs up there so it's hit or miss.",
            "Yes. I used to find exactly what I wanted, now I can't find any relevant content unless I include \"Reddit\" or a bunch of subtractions like this -    to eliminate words that keep popping up. It's become really bad. \n\nAlso, if I google something and click on the page, it always goes to the amp version, which is super annoying. \n\nFinally, if I am looking for something to buy, and have in fact bought it from that company, I then see the same exact product pop up in every ad. I LITERALLY JUST BOUGHT IT, WHY WOULD I WANT IT AGAIN. \n\nGoddamn Google, get your shit together.",

Google [recently changed their search engine to use BERT](https://blog.google/products/search/search-language-understanding-bert/), a language model that is supposed to understand English speech. And yes, it does a good job at parroting what you give it, but I truly think it's a step down from their PageRank algorithm.\n\nRemember that Google's fundamental business model is advertisments.

            "Part of it too is that there's no way to set it to only search recent hits by default, so the bad results just pile up year after year. Most of my google searches are quick adobe how-to or other tech questions, but it will show me pages and pages of results from the mid 2000's - 2010's, but almost nothing relevant to the current version.

            "I just went through a couple months back. There are two things that helped me - first, identifying causes and second, catching myself and redirecting my behavior. Sometimes you can do these things yourself, but sometimes it helps to have a confidante or therapist to help you see the things you don\u2019t.\n\nFor me, I had to recognize that I was setting unreasonable expectations for other people. In doing so, I was setting myself up to keep getting angry over things I cannot control.  I also had to remove myself from contact with people whose behavior was objectively awful.\n\nThat was the easy part. The hard part was catching myself when I started to react in negative ways and reframing how I viewed things. \n\nFor your phone example - that momentary anger when you hear it is fine, but then try recognizing that this is the reaction you want to change. Take a deep breath while you\u2019re in the moment, ask yourself why you\u2019re angry and really think about it, and then *decide* how you would prefer to react. Then, do the thing you decided. If you keep doing this, day after day, you just might find that the anger doesn\u2019t come.\n\nSeriously, this isn\u2019t easy to do. I encourage you to talk to someone you trust and keep your mind open even if you don\u2019t like what you hear. It can be hard to acknowledge our own mistakes, but acknowledging is the first step in improving. Good luck.",

I liked the company and was leaving for school and wanted to go back so I actually gave a month notice. I knew they'd have to hire someone and train them.\n\nThey found someone internal to take over for me in a couple of days so I spent a lot of time at their desk training them. Well, Wednesday of the next week my manager called me into the office to say they were letting me go because I was never at my desk and I wasn't doing my work (a lie).\n\nI filed unemployment. The company tried to fight it, saying I was let go for performance. However, a month before I had my annual review and had all high marks, and had never been in trouble.\n\nUnemployment found on my favor and the company ended up having to pay me unemployment for 6 months. Instead of just paying me for two extra weeks, they fucked themselves.\n",
            "In most places in the US nothing requires you to give them 2 weeks. You may leave without even telling them you've quit. You will never be able to work there again though. \n\nAnd this is the difference. Employers who are firing you will never want you to work for them again, so they will lose nothing by simply walking you out the door. They don't care if you're upset at them. \n\nIf you don't care about upsetting all of those people, go ahead and walk out. They'll never rehire you. If you go somewhere else and someone who you've upset by walking out is there, they may not hire you. \n\nIf a company is forced to lay you off because of a business change or downturn and they do wish to rehire you, they will give you at least 2 weeks notice and keep on good terms with you so that if business makes it possible for them to rehire you they can.

I mentioned that \"Gee you charge us when we are running late, but if you are late what's your penalty (they had a bookkeeper/assistant so they could have called to say that they were running late...)?

The pool of employees is larger and less connected than the pool of employers.\n\nOn the flip side, itnis unlikely your employer can do too much to fuck up your life in 2 weeks between notice and you leaving. On the flip side, an angry employee with nothing to lose absolutely can fuck up a business if they want in 2 weeks. They can mess with files, piss off clients, sew discourd in the rest of the staff, etc. This makes offices more hesitant to give problem employees much warning.\n\nThat said i have been at plenty of jobs that did give notice when there was about to be layoffs, when a grant funded possition was ending, or when they knew of the firing in advance and had a good relationship with the employee.\n\nImmediate firings were most often (though not exclusivelyl a thing when the employee did something wrong and they want them out the door now.\n\nOn the flip side, if a job royally screws you you are well within your rights to walk out the door.

Sure, you may still be close to your boss or team who have no say in the matter. But the company as a whole probably isn't looking to hire you back in the future, nor will they have potential candidates call you for a recommendation about working there. So they have no reason to try to end things on a good note. ",

At my work place even if someone is polite and puts in 2 weeks, its almost viewed as an insult and they dont ever schedule that person for the next 2 weeks unless its some dire emergency in which case they call them in last second.\n\nIts the same as how youre expected to schedule your days off a week or two in advance, but your employer can tell you to not come in for a shift the same day. I think if youre scheduled to work, you should be paid no matter what and if you get called in on a day you arent scheduled it should be automatic overtime.",

Companies aren't in the business of paying you to do nothing. \n\nAlso, consider if someone is told they're being let go and gets angry. If they still have access to the employer's systems, facilities, clients, etc. they could do a lot of damage. \n\nLetting people go creates a big liability.

            "Without reading everyone else's comments, I'll offer this up...\n\nI've worked in HR for several private companies and government agencies. I DO NOT think you owe an employer two weeks notice when you've found a better employment opportunity. For the same reason mentioned in the headline: they wouldn't give YOU two weeks notice if your job was eliminated.\n\nThe impact to YOU, the job-holder, is substantially more significant than any impact your absence would have on a multi-million dollar company. The corporation you work for DOES NOT care that you can't pay your mortgage if they let you go. They'll replace you within two weeks, if your position is still needed. But you still have to struggle, sweat, and cry in order to keep your head above water. Two weeks notice is an outdated policy that corporations hold to in order to minimize the costs of replacing you. Why do you care if the company that would casually let you go saves a few thousand dollars in lost productivity and HR expenses to replace you?\n\nWe all need unions to prevent this sort of thing. But if you can't unionize, exercise your right to be a capitalist and take the bigger, better deal ASAP. \n\nSource: Have been let go from a company I worked very hard for, only to be let go when the economy took a shit in 2008, and years of HR experience.",
            "In Uruguay we don't have notice but we do have severance package by law. You are owed a months salary for each worked year at that company plus the equivalent in cash to any  remaining vacation days. Pretty fair if you ask me.",
            "It depends.   Some positions in my company deal with a lot of money.   When those people give their two weeks notice, they're given two weeks pay and told to leave immediately.   \n\nThe one time I was laid off, I was given 6 months notice, because the company was merging with another. ",
            "They should, or pay you out unless you do something really stupid to get fired, not let go. I\u2019m from Canada tho. ",
            "Because we think unions suck and apparently we like it when employers have all the power. ",
            "In Norway you first have to have a legitimate and documented reason for firing someone.\n\nThen you give them a written confirmation of this, and have a meeting with you regarding it.\n\nThen, in most cases they are required to give you a second chance to change the things you can be fired for.\n\nBecause of this process, it can sometimes take over a year to be fired.",
            "Because they don\u2019t want you to burn the place down. Or take your stapler.",
            "Because the people that came before you decided that Unions were stupid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter working for the same company for 3 months they have to give me 1 months notice,\n\nafter 1 year, they have to give me 3 months notice, after 5 years its 6 months, after 10 years its a years notice.\n\nThis goes both ways.  \n\nMy union has holiday cabins all over my country that I can rent cheap.\n\nShould I fall ill, my employer pays me, the right to sick days is accumulated, the most it can go up to is 6 months, after which the union kicks in and covers up to 80% wages for 9 months.\n\nMy union sponsors education, gym memberships, and other stuff.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf I have done something that warrants immediate dismissal,(theft, not showing up for work, any kind of abuse or bullying etc etc) I loose these rights.   \n\n\nThis creates stability. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",
            "One word. Capitalism",
            "Because you are living in capitalist shithole?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n'Cause in modern european countries employer have to give prior notice so you can find another job until your contract ceased.",
            "There was a lawsuit in the 1980's regarding large plant layoffs and giving workers notice. It was shot down on free speech grounds because the courts agreed with the corporation that it would in effect force them to disclose corporate information. ",
            "Because we have a toxic work culture where if something will inconvenience you, you suck it up, but if it inconveniences your employer they\u2019ll go scorched earth on your ass."

Yup, those too. \n\nSome even have other stores inside of them. The one near where I went to college had a barber shop inside, and the one near my dad has a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts.

They\u2019ve gone on like 3 shopping sprees there so far and I\u2019m pretty sure my gf is driving one of them there again now lol.

            "It's worth saying that no one else is really touching on that it's usually the cheap (quality and price) version of everything. Like, you can go to wal-mart and get it, if you just want the thing. But if you're serious about the thing you're getting, you go to a specialty store.\n\nThis is fine for a lot of stuff though. Like, their Shrek 2 DVD's aren't any worse than the ones at Best Buy. And sometimes you just need the cheap crappy tent or whatever. If you're just a city guy who decided to go camping for a weekend just for a change of pace, go get the crappy tent and pick up Shrek 2 on a crappy portable DVD player to watch while you're there.\n\nBut if I was a serious outdoor hobbyist, I would go to an actual camping store.",

Camping, bicycles, t.v.'s, console games, gaming consoles, Clothing shoes, baby needs are all at my local.walmart supercenter.  And the best part is I can go online order up all my grocery and store needs, reserve a time, then show up at the reserved parking spots, call them on the phone and they will come out and put it all in my car while I sit and wait for them to pack it.  They show me a tablet like device and I sign for it and drive away.  These stores are huge, we are talking the size of a soccer field.  Look up a Walmart super center on Google maps and see for yourself, and they are everywhere!!!",

            "Honestly not that crazy. Many many \"big-box\" stores have sold a similar assortment of items in the past. I remember in 50's or so, JCPenny (The clothing store) had advertisements for firearms. Think of it as a sort of \"old-time\" General Store. You could go in and buy some ammo for hunting, maybe flour for baking, and fabric for making clothes.\n\nThat being said, while I sometimes feel the same way about Walmart, I think back to how many other stores were like that at some point or another. It's sort of cool in a way to have a true all-purpose store, and one that still exists. Kinda like how the progression of society and technology made these stores more niche.",

            "I don\u2019t think either are particularly okay to joke about unless you know the person specifically and they are okay with it. \n\nBut I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that women are told you need great hair and long eyelashes to be considered attractive. If you look at how many hair and eyelash products there are targeted at women than men they are completely outweighed. Plus there is a large amount of men who choose to shave their head so I guess it\u2019s a lot more commonly accepted to see men with no hair whereas not many women shave their head. There are also other symptoms than hair loss with alopecia that you don\u2019t get with baldness. A lot of it has to do with societal norms and pressure on how women should look whereas it\u2019s more \u201cacceptable\u201d to see a man without hair.",

Or when you try to explain to your friend group that making fun of balding is no better than making fun of someone for being fat and they in turn double down on the jokes because they disagree. Having to wear a hat every day because you lived you life long enough to know that your guaranteed to get harassed if you take it off.\n\nGuys can\u2019t even wear wigs, like are we gonna pretend toupees haven\u2019t been the universally mocked for ages?

            "Rude either way. But it's touchier for women because for so long women's worth has been so tied up with others' valuation of their appearance in a way that men's has not. Men have insecurities about their looks but are much less likely to suffer professionally or socially if others perceive them as unattractive. Then there's the fact that baldness is largely associated with masculinity. And, aside from the social policing that demands women be \"attractive\" there's an added layer that prohibits them from being \"masculine.\" TLDR: historically, a bald woman has had much more chance of being ostracized or missing out on opportunities just because of her baldness than a bald man does (not to mention one is a disease and the other is not)",

            "I think the honest answer for me is: bald guys are more normal, but when people see a bald woman they first think either sick (leukemia) or counter culture / alternative punk style. Alopecia for women is more rare and not as publicly visible. I also think women are more likely to use a wig, which helps with self esteem but doesn't help public awareness.\n\nI think it's easier for a bald man to still feel handsome and good looking, even if some people are weird bullies about it. It's not that making fun of bald men is okay, it is just seen more by comparison. A woman with no hair might feel the pressure from beauty standards a little more keenly on average. Not to mention baldness in men is caused by too much testosterone (haven't confirmed), which is an excellent rebuttal to said bullies.\n\nDon't slap people.

It\u2019s having no eyebrows, no eyelashes, no body hair in general.\n\nIt tends to be much more jarring and make people more self-conscious.\n\nBut honestly making fun of anyone for anything is rude unless it\u2019s in good fun between friends.",

            "Both are bad to make fun of ofc, but at the end of the day (like lots of others are mentioning) women often feel their self image attached to their hair. \n\nAn example I would say is if I walked into a room and saw a bald man I wouldn\u2019t really pay it a second thought, but if I saw a bald woman my first thoughts (even though they shouldn\u2019t be my first thoughts) would be something along the lines of \u201coh she must have lost it, poor thing\u201d even though I have some friends who are girls who chose to rock the shaved look and looked amazing. \n\nIt\u2019s still fucked to make fun of guys for it too, but in the grand scheme of things (and hopefully we can change the mindset) \n\nBald man = I see this every day \nBald woman = something must be wrong with her",
            "Because male pattern baldness is much more common",
            "They are both fucked. But socially a girl has a lot more involved with looks.\n\nThat and there are more bald men, as a guy once you go bald, you know what you gotta do. You start hitting the gym, get a new tatoo and some oakleys.\n\nWhat do you do as a girl? Realistically, you do all you can to show you're not going through chemo.\n\nSo they are both terrible to make fun of, but since its rarer in girls, its a bigger deal. Its much easier to deal with being bald, when society has accepted bald men as normal.",
            "Who makes fun of balding men?\n\nThe same douche who will make fun of a balding woman.",
            "Haven't seen this answer/clarification, yet...\n\nWe haven't heard a joke about alopecia.  We heard a joke about short hair, which can come from various causes.  The spin that it was joke ABOUT alopecia is unfair to all involved, and an attempt to backhandedly defend what was an unacceptable reaction.\n\nThe joke was relating a well defined woman who is sexy with short hair to another well defined woman who is sexy with short hair.  It has very tangential relation to how the hair became short (and not \"bald\" like me, either).\n\nSo if you make fun of someone's alopecia, that just sucks.  But if you make a joke like we heard in a room where everyone knows the situation, then it shouldn't really be a problem.",

            "I don't think it's particularly funny to make fun of anything a person has no control over. \n\nBut, I think one big difference is 70% of men will lose their hair, and they expect and know about it their whole life, and have a pretty big support in the form of others around them who are also balding. \n\nWomen do *not* expect to lose their hair, and it *is* tied to our self worth and idea of beauty. Women with shorter hair have been called some derogatory names implying they're less of a woman for not having hair, fueling the fear of being bald. Women have fewer options for support since most women are *not* losing their hair, and other women are not the safe space you might hope for. \n\nWhen a man is bald in public, he is bald in public. \nWhen a woman is bald in public, she is waiting to here, \"Hey! Someone pulled a Brittney...\"\n\nSpecial Re-Mentioning: I still don't think it's cool to be making jokes about these things. Those kinds of jokes can land and be guttsplitting comedy, but for the butt of the joke, it may be day one of their newly established insecurity. \n\nTaking care of your pals is more important than a laugh at anyone's expense. \n\nLive your life, I'm no Jesus, but just be sure to show a little extra love to your balding homies of any gender. But... *Don't mention the bald thing.*",
            "Men can still be seen as masculine without hair, but a bald woman may be made to feel less feminine because she has no hair, and hair is something women are expected to be prized for.  \n\n\nThere's also the fact that a lot of men, if not \\*most\\* men, will go bald as they age. As a result, sometimes the jokes about going bald may be more of a case of men laughing with each other than of men laughing at a woman whose situation is seen as unusual and embarrassing.",

Just a few minutes ago, the clock ran out and the project ended. By the time it ended, they'd deleted all of their other social media accounts, and when the clock reached zero, they deleted the channel. \n\nMy 11-year-old is on the couch crying because it's over.

Someone mentioned this as grieving in the comments above, and I would agree. Our human brains are not evolved to fully deal and understand the context of the emotional experience. We grow close to these characters and it releases neurochemicals as if they are real and when they no longer exist in our experience, it feels like grief.",

Browsing reddit, I found some recommandations.\n\nSo I started Leigh Bardugo's Grishaverse, with the Grisha Trilogy. It's very different, very dark, but I like it. I don't know for when I'll end this series too, though. The emptiness is lurking, yet again, I guess.\n\nI think, it's ok to feel empty, for a while. The excitement of discovering something new is also part of the journey to get over this emptiness.

So if im reading its pages, if im watching tv its episodes, if im playing a game then its matches or minutes and so on. \n\nFor example, every 5 pages I read in my textbook, I can go check something off my to-do list like \u2611 Sort Laundry. Then 5 pages later \u2611 Put Laundry in washer. And maybe 5 page's later the laundry isn't done so I \u2611 Take the garbage out. And so on.

            "You've got a few factors to consider. \n\n1) there are literally more inhabited planets than there are active Jedi at their highest strength. Even during the Republic, 99% of citizens never saw a Jedi in person, and 99.99999% of those same citizens never saw the Jedi use any powers. The average citizen of the Republic was probably pretty skeptical of the Jedi actually having powers, and instead suspected that they were just leaning on legends of their powers to conduct their diplomatic missions. Sure, maybe the Jedi had powers long ago, but these days you're pretty skeptical of the whole thing.\n\n2) the Empire, which controls virtually all interplanetary communications through the Holo-net, set about eradicating every record of the Jedi's power and influence. Where they couldn't erase stuff, they set about gas lighting the population about the corruption and fraud that was rife in the Jedi order, to the point that most people would believe that the Jedi had been tricking the Republic before Palpatine came along to save it.\n\n3) anyone that had concrete info about the Jedi knew to keep their heads down and play along, or risk attracting the attention of the Empire and Vader's efforts to eradicate the remaining Jedi. This fear of openly discussing them would cause the Jedi to quickly fall into legends.",
            "Nothing official, but looking online, some people say that there were maybe 10,000 Jedi at their peak, but the population of the galaxy was 100 quadrillion sentients over 50 million worlds.

            "Because, contrary to popular belief and what he may claim, George Lucas did *not* have the whole series planned out from start to finish. He pretty much made it up as he went along, occasionally accepting creative input from others until his head got too big.\n\nObi-Wan states that the Jedi were the guardians of the Republic for more than a thousand generations, but a few characters make it obvious that Force users/worshippers were generally viewed with skepticism at best. Han Solo, who would have been alive during the supposed purge (albeit only ten or fifteen at the oldest), initially thought it was a bunch of superstitious mumbo-jumbo, and despite Vader's obvious power, many in the Empire wrote off the Force as an old, dying religion.\n\nI think it's more likely that the Jedi (and the Sith) would have lived quiet, monastic lifestyles dedicated to studying their own beliefs, similar to Catholic and Buddhist monks. They would have been viewed as secretive, perhaps even cultish, by outsiders, coming forth only as needed. Conspirators would have viewed them as having an unhealthy influence on the government, much like conspiracy theorists today view groups like the Freemasons with suspicion.\n\nConsequently, after Palpatine became the Chancellor, he wouldn't have simply walked in and said, \"Hey, dudes, I'm the Emperor,\" but he would have gone total Nazi-style and focused on magnifying and spreading a strong anti-Jedi sentiment among the population, radicalizing his supporters, and declaring himself the Emperor only after gaining enough influence to guarantee he could defend such a position.",

Did you see one in person? If you say yes, you're lying. If you say no, then that proves you don't know and you just bought into the deep-state conspiracy cover-up to prevent Lord Palpatine from making the galaxy great again.",

There are also not that many force users. Most are just normal civilians. After Order 66, almost the entire Jedi order was wiped out. Jedi and Sith thus become myths to more people.

            "Because the prequels make no sense.",
            "Due to the pandemic, I was trying to write something about the early formation of the Rebellion, and how the origins weren't what people expected.  As I wrote this I wondered exactly this question, along with coming to also wonder why there weren't Jedi Temples all around the Galaxy.  \n\n[I was a huge Star Wars fan as a child, but have lost interest since the prequels.  If i'm mistaken or off, this is not from someone with a great deal of knowledge outside the movies.  It was just a fun thing to do to occupy my time.]\n\nIn my brief attempt to write, I tried to explain why the Jedi were forgotten in exchanges with Bail Organa to both Qi'ra and Young Leia.  Remember, this is all just my concept, and has no standing as fact:\n\nBail explains at different points that the Emperor immediately began to erase or change history from record, much like how in Episode II a planet is removed from the archives.  Palpatine's Empire destroys and disrupts any and all history of Jedi and political enemies.  Purging this prevents opportunity to look to opponents of his.  With galactic control, he is able to make it illegal to spread false information, with harsh penalties, and things like video, images, text and relics are all removed and destroyed from both physical and virtual catalogs.\n\nRemember in Episode I, how some Jedi treated the Sith as extinct, forgotten?  So much so that they actually didn't believe Qui-Gon's story about a Sith attacker on Tattooine.  This would be the same trend after the years of Palpatine's power and misinformation.  \n\nBut this is also done for more than just the overt reason of hiding the history of the enemy of the Sith.  Palpatine also would eliminate any history of Anakin Skywalker.  All of it.\n\nBy doing so, the Emperor hoped to push his puppet further into only being Darth Vader, manipulating him into having no human identity or past.  Palpatine would also truly eliminate the history of Padme Amidala as well, which would explain why Leia knew next to nothing about her (only what Bail would later tell her).  [This would sort of serve as a nice way to 'clean' the series, explaining why Leia had vague understanding of her mother, since all records of her mother's existence were being removed and any of it would be illegal to possess, especially for someone as prominent as Bail Organa or family.]\n\nRemoving all the contacts of Anakin's past means that even Vader cannot reflect on what he was.  In the moments of solitude he would have horrific flashbacks to a past he could not truly confirm, driving him deeper to anger and insanity, exactly where the Emperor needed him.  [This would explain why he almost feels an excitement when he senses Obi-Wan on the Death Star, as this would serve as some sort of proof that Anakin Skywalker's distorted past did exist in some way. \n With the Jedi history purged and discredited, even Anakin was unaware what was truth.]\n\nThis idea was based around a few references, but a big one was how people in certain religions or countries are not allowed to use the internet like other people are.  It's filtered, and designed to keep out information that could change opinion or spark debate.  \n\nIt sounds impossible to think that in a few years people could forget something so prominent as a war or the people in it, but without any way to confirm memory, who could be certain.  Young people would grow up doubting the myths, older people would censor themselves out of fear.  \n\nIf you look at the modern world, it has access to the vast internet, yet people have such conflicting information or disinformation.  When you consider it, Palpatine being able to either hide or distort an entire group isn't too impossible.  He would gain further political strength as well, as those who brought up such 'fake history' could be labeled as fools, or worse...\n\nIt's a very neat question, as the idea of an internet clearly was not a concept in the original trilogy's time, and even in the prequel trilogy the internet still hadn't fully become what it is now.  But if someone edited all Wikipedia pages to remove or discredit certain people, and Wikipedia was the only source for all, or just enough of the population, I do believe you can manipulate people into forgetting a past and believing a manufactured past.  It fits really well with the actions of a Sith.",

Even 5hough in that they said they were life forms... But that didn't line up with the lore from when Yoda was explaining how the force was in everything even rocks and spaceships, case in point lifting an x wing with the force.\n\nEP 7 and 8 were boring and deviated more and more from said lore. I mean how are there life form midecloreans inside a bolt of charged plasma from a storm troopers blaster? I ask BC Kylo Ren could freeze one in place because of midecloreans.\n\nEP 9 was disturbing. Every scene was a dumpster fire. Every scene had me yelling at my tv going 1hat the eff?\n\nSolo was okay, but once again the writers or director never bothered to research the character han solo from EP 4 5 and 6. But I can let that slide compared to the hot mess that was the latest trilogy.\n\nRogue squadron was enjoyable and made sense, I don't know what happened there to make the plot and universe make sense, maybe they had new hires and interns that actually liked the SW universe. My only gripe was the cg Tarkin. They should have just gotten a random old dude and taken all his shots from behind never showing his face  no need for fake cg closeup.\n\nAnd finally... Mandallorian.. everyone's fav new SW story. It is fun to watch, the graphics are great. But the main character is boring, I don't really feel like there is any legit story. And once again the mandaloriand don't make much sense when you look at the mandalorians from the clone wars series.\n\nBtw the clone wars series was pretty good. They filled a lot of gaps and holes that EP 1 2 and 3 left out.\n\nLast but not least the SW books. Had some great content on them, then Disney decided that they were retconning things so the books never happened. That's fine but 2hat a waste of 1uality content so that they could replace it with Kylo I am your father kill me now gurgle Harrison Ford was probably ashamed to be a part of that movie.\n\nEdit.

The Prequel Trilogy was written years after the fact, and details like Han's description of the Jedi were glossed over for rule of cool. Thus you have Han calling the Jedi a \"hokey religion\" when he's probably old enough to still have heard stories of the Jedi's powers: based on Luke's age.

It was only an Order containing like 15 thousand people max in an entire galaxy of living beings. So not only had most living beings never encountered a Jedi, they were told that if they did they would be killed indiscriminately. 20 years may not seem like much but it does give time for an entire generation of people to be born and spend their entire lives being told the Jedi were evil by the time you refer to in the story.

            "1. It wasn't a branch of the government. It was a monastic temple full of bureaucratic psychic monks that, after thousands of years of being spread across the galaxy, settled on the wealthiest part of the  capital city of the capital planet, inaccessible to anyone but Jedi and high-ranking members of the Republic government. \n\n2. There are trillions of people in the galaxy and only about 10,000 Jedi in the Clone Wars era. This is counting every Master, Jedi Knight, Padawan learner, and youngling apprentice. The math on that means that most of those trillions of people in the galaxy never heard of, saw, or believed the Jedi existed since they never came to their part of the galaxy unless there was some dire emergency that was deemed important enough to get a Jedi assigned to it. The Jedi assigned to these missions usually numbered no more than two (knight and padawan) and since they were requested for the mission by the heads of state of that system/planet, the common people never saw them unless the mission took them into direct contact with those people. \n\n3. The Empire, meaning Palpatine, made sure to wipe the Jedi out of the memories of the people by way of controlling the media, destroying their temples, murdering or turning every Jedi they found, and getting rid of all their books and holocrons. If you don't think people can be made to forget something so significant in a single generation, ask yourself what you knew about the Tulsa Massacre prior to *Watchmen* being on HBO. History is written by the victors, and sometimes the victors *are* the bad guys. \n\nMost people never believed the Jedi were anything but some strange propaganda by the Republic. I mean... Wizard-monks who steal children and use laser swords to fight bad guys? Riiight. It was probably just a bunch of weirdos in robes who pretended to have powers, but really just relied on tricks and technology to make themselves look mysterious and mystical, right? \n\nLet me ask you this: Do you know anything about Harry Blackstone Sr? He was once one of the most famous magicians on this planet. You *might* have heard of his son, Harry Blackstone Jr., but maybe not since even he died in the 1990s (and yes, he was one of the most famous magicians of the 80s and 90s). Both of them had amazing \"powers\" on stage. Both were on TV and seen by thousands of people-- maybe even millions-- during their lifetimes.\n\nAnd now... How many people here JUST learned about their existence from what I said above? I bet it's a lot. I bet nobody under 20 knew anything about them (unless they were magician geeks and studied the lore). I bet few Millennials even know anything about them, and certainly never saw either of them in person. \n\nBut I did. I was on stage with Harry Blackstone Jr. when I was a teenager in the 1980s. I helped him with one of his illusions (and it was a really great one where he made a cage and bird disappear while I had my hand on it). When I was a teenager, I knew who he was and I admired his stage art, and even aspired to duplicating it (but then learned I'm awful at prestidigitation and lacked the patience to get better). \n\nI could pick other names. The point is that there are lots of people and groups that fade from the collective consciousness after 20 years. It happens. And that's just on a planet with a few billion people. Expand the range to an entire galaxy and the chances of some random person on some planet somewhere knowing who the Jedi were 20 years after they died out in a galaxy where their memory was purposely being repressed drops pretty low.",

On a planet like Earth, that's a very small minority, but in a galaxy filled with trillions of life forms, that's incredibly minuscule.\n\nThe Jedi were only really active in Republic space. They didn't get to go to the outer rim or even some mid rim worlds outside of Republic space. So in a massive galaxy, they only got to go to a handful of planets. Many people outside of the Republic probably didn't believe in them, and those that did never understood the difference between Jedi and Sith.\n\nThe Empire completely wiped out the Jedi. Utterly and completely. Not just killing them, but erasing them from history. Jedi temples were destroyed along with their records. All traces of the Jedi, aside from the few in hiding, were completely gone.\n\nAnd so the Empire wiped their records, so no one was to learn about them in school or anything. The generation of children growing up at the dawn of the Empire, didn't learn about the Jedi, and people who were adults during the Jedi's existence, didn't talk about them, it was taboo. The Empire wanted the Jedi gone from history and so it was done. Talking about the Jedi would make you seem like a sympathizer and probably get you imprisoned or worse.\n\nAnd most people didn't want to talk about Jedi, because they didn't see them as heroes and wanted them gone. The Jedi were blamed for the Clone Wars, and seen as warmongers, not Guardians of peace. By the time the Clone Wars came to an end, most Republic citizens hated the Jedi and saw them as corrupt, so they easily believed Palpatine when he said they tried to overthrow the Republic, and went along with them being wiped out.

They also weren't technically a branch of galactic government - they were an independent body which enjoyed the patronage of said government, so once again, their relevance to the day to day lives of most people was nothing. The only big group of people in recent times who regularly saw Jedi, and Jedi Force stuff, were... Clone troopers.

            "> when there was an entire branch of the government run by Jedi less than 20 years ago?\n\nIt's exaggerated but not by much. A bit of context:\n\n* The Jedi council was no a branch of the government. They did cooperate (heavily during the clone wars), but they were neither elected nor did they hold official positions.\n\n* The Jedi were rare. Like, \"do you remember the last time you saw someone suffering from dwarfism in real life\" rare. There were a lot of people in the galaxy that have never seen a Jedi by themself.\n\n* Information doesn't travel quickly and has a short half-life in the SW Universe. There are no in-universe explanations for this. It's mostly plot convenience. But it's still a part of the universe as it has been repeatedly shown that information gets lost quickly. Ironically the one organization that tried to preserve knowledge over a long time are the Jedi themself.\n\n* The earliest official mentions of the Jedi as something legendary are in ANH or Rogue One. In Rogue One rebellion Pilots use \"May the force be with you.\" without most of them having seen a Jedi within their lifetime. Hera Syndulla is probably one of the very few exceptions to this, and she is one in a pretty sizable group of people. This happens about 19 years after the Emperor rose to power and purged the Jedi. As comparison, the attack on the Twin Towers in NYC was about 19 years ago. But it was also the year 20.000 people died in an earthquake in India. You might very vividly remember 9/11, but no the earthquake, because of how it affected you. Same in the SW universe. Since the Jedi were so rare, their actions were mostly invisible by the larger population. Them disappearing was washed away with the empire taking over.",

Most people never would have seen footage of the Jedi or them leading the war effort, and more than that, the universe is huge with a huge population. Most would have only heard of the Jedi and never met one. That's why we see sith being confused for the Jedi at times, because they see a lightsaber and think \" well this must be a Jedi\".
