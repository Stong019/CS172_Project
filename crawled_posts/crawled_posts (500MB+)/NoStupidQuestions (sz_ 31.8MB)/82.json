            "> I can't recall seeing a prominent left wing figure that does public speeches and debates where they \"dismantle the capitalist agenda\".\n\nIt depends a little on what you mean. There are plenty of prominent left or left leaning speakers who regularly give arguments against right wing agendas, the military-industrial complex and/or capitalism in general. Some names that come to mind are Noam Chomsky, Naomi Klein, Amy Goodman, Norman Finkelstein, and possibly Slavoj Zizek, although I think he's in a slightly different category. There are many others if you start searching around. \n\nIf you search for any of those, you can probably find public lectures where they take questions from the audience and respond to criticisms. Finkelstein, for example, intentionally lets the first questions to come from his critics. They will all argue their points with facts and, like you said, the critics are usually less experienced. I'm not sure if that is more or less what you mean by being a \"dominant debater\" though. I feel like in those cases, it's less a matter of \"always right\" and more a matter of \"I will explain why I disagree with that.\" But my personal bias might cloud my own judgement here. ",
            "I feel like it is because the left wing is notorious for infighting. Liberalism is all about reform, pluralism and personal identity so you get a LOT of differing opinions within the left wing. There is no cohesion, the same reason why there are so many protestant denominations. So no Shapiro can pop up submitting talking points without retaliation from other left wingers \n\nMeanwhile the right wing are all about stability, cohesion and group identity. So right wing opinions are very similiar and they are more easily rallied behind a strong leader (though I wouldn't call their current choice a \"strong leader\"). Hence, Shapiro can reach an audience of right wingers that agree with him with little retaliation from his \"side\".\n\nEdit: wow this post exploded. I would like to add that I am not a politics expert, I just like to interpret things. I just gave my 2 cents.

The thread seems to be full of leftists trying to subtley insult right leaning people.\n\nLook at pseudoscience versus real scientists. There are few prominent scientists who take parts in debates, because the arguments for science are nuanced and less appealing than for pseudoscience, which usually has some kind of intuitive appeal. For example, we can't see evolution, so it must be bullshit.\n\nIn much the same way, conservative politics has a deep primal appeal. We like people like us, we like to keep our money, we like things the way they have always been. That's easy.\n\nLeftists have to explain why it's okay to change, and it's okay to use our money for the government, and why people outside our experience are helpful. This is hard to do, and requires nuance.\n\nThe more nuanced an argument, the worse it does in a debate. That's a problem.",

            "Disclaimer: I'm absolutely a leftist.\n\nResponse to the question:\n\nI think this is a confluence of two problems. The first is that leftists as a group seem to be too worried about shielding themselves from criticism or minor discomfort to engage in structured debate - they don't want to address points or claims, they want to address how those claims make them feel, and too frequently if those claims are discomfiting, they are dismissed out of hand and shouted down rather than rebutted.\n\nThe second issue is that people on the right (as a group, seems to, blah blah) don't want or don't understand nuance. They want a hardline, simple explanation of events, morality, etc. My mother is a good example, she'll scream all day on facebook about abortion, but she totally took my sister to get a late term abortion, because the situation was nuanced - baby had a neural tube defect, was going to be born without a brain - yet still can't/won't apply her own experience of living through a complicated situation to the world at large.\n\nedit: for moar nuance",
            "Something betacuck something. ",
            "The right argues long held values/morals/beliefs that are historically founded and grounded. This allows the right to reference already established guidelines for the way things are now and they're good at arguing that side of the debate. The left wants to drive change - upset all those beliefs while standing on the foundation of the need for change which is an ever shifting ground. It's hard to argue what you can't see or haven't experienced before.\n\nIt can also be said that the left and right are the yin and yang  (not necessarily in that particular order though) to our free society. The left makes change happen (or wins arguments) when the right loses their ground on matters of enough importance to the whole of the nation. The right keeps the left in check (and wins arguments) by slowing/stopping changes the left wants to make that could upset or hurt current societal standards.",

There's thousands of instances of both of those people telling verifyable lies, you can look it up online. There's entire websites dedicated to identifying and untangling these obvious lies - but the right doesn't care.

And then those ppl say: \"finally he tells it how it is!\" Well just because its what you REALLY feel its not automatically how it is. Shaporo, Peterson etc actually give very simple answers. They seem smart by their way of arguing and they seem logical but most of the time their case is actually quite simple and not original. To listen to somebody like this gives you the feeling of being smart because they validate your feelings of anger or fear and justify them with seemingly logical, rational reasoning.  However things are mostly very complicated, not easy. \nThe left on the other hand often argues in a complicated way. Right and wrong are not easily in line with what you feel. They refuse to give simple answers (lets leave aside psychotic sjw) and thats what makes them hard to listen to sometimes and less popular.

Think climate change or minimum wage increase or taxation policy or any number of other subjects.

They tend to view arguments as something to be won or lost rather than approaching working towards a reasonable outcome. Thats why they'll never admit defeat, for instance if they say x and you deconstruct why x is wrong they'll often just say well what about y without admitting they were wrong about x. This is explained much better in this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmVkJvieaOA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmVkJvieaOA). This is why they \"never look wrong\", they'll change the subject before admitting defeat.\n\nOther examples of the right appearing to be good at arguing, when really there just a bit shit include:\n\n\\- Jordan Peterson making fake deep points which are extremely vague then when the debater tries to tie down his position so they can debate it he just says \"no thats not what I meant\": [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQ3RL3WZaXg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQ3RL3WZaXg)\n\n\\- Ben Shapiro making about tons of unrelated points in quick succession in order to confuse whoever is debating him, and making sure the person can't respond to everything because they'll try and make a detailed argument about everything which they won't have time for: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTx\\_SXun\\_4&t=505s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcTx_SXun_4&t=505s) (This is pretty much the equivalent of spamming a single button in streetfighter, it may look impressive to beginners, but it's really a shitty way to debate (and wouldn't be allowed in proper debate format))\n\n\\- Constant goalpost shifting: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaPgDQkmqqM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaPgDQkmqqM)\n\n\\- PraguerU being a pile of shit: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM7BgrddY18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM7BgrddY18)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow if you watched the videos I mentioned at the top you'll probably realise they weren't nearly as snappy as the videos in which the right \"own\" the left. That's because instead of focusing on maintaining the appearance of \"winning\" a debate, they instead focus on building nuanced views and comprehensive arguments which takes as more time and doesn't involve as many \"bazing\" moments.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow am I saying that everyone on the right argues in bad faith? No, but it does seem to be a trend. And am I saying that everyone on the left is good at debate? Of course not that would be stupid. But the clickbaity responses don't seem to get nearly as popular on the left.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

            "This is due to the flawed reasoning inherent in modern day Liberalism. They know many of their points/ideas are wrong on a fundamental level and are therefore indefensible from a reason/logic based perspective. That's why Leftists are notorious for appealing to emotions and feelings. Their arguments cannot hold up under the scrutiny of reality. It's for this reason that you rarely see a Leftist ideologue of any note. If you attempt to engage in a reasoned debate; they'll typically resort to name calling and little else.  ",

Bill Maher comes to mind, personally, as a simplistic asshole who leans left.\n\nBasically, it seems more and more that any talking head, left or right, is in it for the fame more than the societal benefit. Ignore them and find and read more news that goes in-depth into things. You will almost immediately, if you go back to the talking heads, have thoughts like \"Well...uh...it's more complicated than that....\"",
            "So I can actually recommend you a few like Contrapoints, Hbomber, Three Arrows and Philosophytube. That being said, there are a few reasons there seem to be fewer left wing youtubers. \n\nMost importantly I think it may just be the amount of attention the right ones get by stirring up contraversy, as well as taking advantage of youtube's broken algorithms. It could be partly due to your viewing habits as well. Groups on the right seem to get along better than those on the left cause while pissing off a leftist may get them to cry, pissing off a Nazi will make them want to kill you. Only exception might be muslim terrorists who are also terribly conservative, but not really because they're more likely to take it out on innocent refugees who also want nothing to do with them.\n\nI think that you can't really lecture anyone on leftist politics unless you do a lot of research, but these libertarian types can get away with it by thinking their common sense and surface view of things is enough to understand a complex matter. I've also noticed that they may have a more confrontational approach to things where they claim to want to hear different perspectives,l like they're enlightened for taking Nazis seriously, but often won't give the same courtesy to their far left counterparts. They've turned debate from an intellectual matter into a sort of art form or *battle* where their goal is to *win* and nothing else. By doing so, they can easily manipulate things to their advantage to make themselves look as smart as possible and gain the most support. Examples are: picking the weakest and often most ridiculous opposition, taking what they say out of context, and my favorite, \"debating\" with someone in a prerecorded video where they can pause to nitpick the tiniest semantics while the person in the video can't respond at all or even know they exist.\n\nOf course, they're also unwilling to do the extensive reading I mentioned, because it's so much easier to just listen to other people talk about these opinions in this day and age. As a result, though, they're far more likely to fall into echo chambers. I think that over the past few decades, while the left has been getting more educated in how to achieve their goals, the right has only learned new tricks. The optimistic side of me hopes people get wiser to this and things don't actually regress to a pre-world war era. \n\nI spent maybe a year or two down that rabbithole thinking I was just being a \"self-reflective centrist\", but then Trump was elected and I realized how delusional I was for thinking conservatives were as weak and oppressed as they claimed they were just because I live in a very left leaning area and wished people around me would reflect more on the problems with their ideas. And honestly, I'd recommend getting out for anyone else still involved. This \"balanced\" point of view you may have where you feel you need to listen to as many opinions as possible, but this is a result of a false dichotomy in how most elections are done to encourage two psrties and no more. It  also means that you leave yourself vulnerable to the manipulative tactics of fascists and their enablers, and trust me, no matter how much of a critical thinker you are, you can't be ready for every trick they use and look every matter up, especially facts they leave out and you wouldn't have anyway of knowing about. It's also extremely tiring to be that hateful and frustrated all the time, and really unhealthy.",
            "Just my opinion here, but those on the right find comfort in an authoritarian approach to divisive issues. They like it when another person uses force to push an agenda that a conservative agrees with. Those on the left do not value that trait and are more apt to allow a differing opinion to exist unchallenged. So it isn't really that they don't exist on the left, but rather those on the left don't follow those types so they're not very popular.",

Why would this person debate a media studies undgrad on fox news who works for a think tank who has simply memorized catchy rebuttals?\n\nThe right wing debaters, to me, are like those people who pretend to talk to your dead relatives.  They use knowledge gaps and cognitive weaknesses they know the majority of conservative people have to make money.  If you can put two brain cells together and think about anything they say, it's complete bullshit.",
            "Because \"dominant debaters\" function more like reality stars than political debaters. Internet teenagers love them but in an actual political discussion with professionals I doubt they would be taken seriously- they seem to mostly avoid those situations as well.",

            "I think folks like Rachel Maddow are their counterparts on the left.  She's \"always right\", but only because her show is 99% her talking condescendingly to the camera about how wrong her opponents are.\n\nLike you said, it's about different values appealing to different crowds.  For conservatves, \\*winning\\* is real important, so you see a lot of those guys \"winning\" by shooting down easy targets.\n\nLiberals are more driven by self-validation and \"being right\", so a talking head reassuring them that they're on the right side of history, is more appealing.  Even if somebody they don't respect is wrong, they're right and that's what matters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere's also a popular opinion in liberal circles that their opponents are so awful that they shouldn't be given a platform, even if it's to debate a strawman.  By debating a racist you're giving voice to racism, or something.  There's sense in that of course, but it combines with the rhetorical trick of saying that everything you don't like is racist.  If everything is racist, and racism isn't debatable, then nothing is debatable.",

            "It has to do with the psychology of the right wing right now. The right wing views the left and liberalism as an increasingly heavy handed dominant cultural force. They view people like Ben Shapiro as stalwarts standing firm against the onslaught of the liberal horde taking over our society. It's a fundamentally insecure dynamic. They fear that society is evolving into something they can't understand or adapt to and watching Ben Shapiro \"destroy a clueless liberal\" makes them feel emboldened and empowered while a society changing around them increasingly makes them feel ignorant.",
            "\"arguing with facts\" works and is a dominant form of debating because it's more convincing than arguing with feelings. It's not right or left, it's right or wrong.",
            "I think it's because of what and how Right wing speakers argue. Whether they're good arguments or not, right wing speakers tend to give straightforward, easy to understand explanations to problems, making them more charismatic, even if their argument doesn't make sense, or is more complicated.\n\n For example, Ben Shapiro might say \"Women make less because they choose to not pursue harder carreers\". This is a simple explanation that seemingly makes sense. A liberal debater might respond \"Well it's more complicated than that, we need to consider _why_ women choose to pursue different carreers to truly solve the issue\".\n\n This is much less satisfying of an argument because it requires more explanation and overall is more complicated and less comfortable. Therefore, Ben Shapiro has basically already won (or \"destroyed the libtard with facts and logic\") because he was able to make a simple claim that people are willing to understand, even though truly, the issue is more complicated than he says. It is because conservatives are able to make simpler arguments like this that they are dominant in debate.",

So one example is transgenderism, \"I feel this way therefore I am\" vs \"you have an x and y chromosome therefore you are\" \n\nGranted there are times where that's flipped such as global warming, but how often does the title read \"Ben Shapiro destroys snowflake over global warming.\" You don't, you really only see social issues like abortion, transgenderism etc. etc. \n\nJust my two cents.

            "After fighting with Bard for like 10 minutes, I think that what distinguishes between her fandom and that of any other talented mainstream musician who writes catchy songs has to do with her very public internet persona being in contrast to her very private personal life.    We do not yet fully understand the causal mechanisms of obsession, but they seem to involve uncertainty, excitement, intrigue, and false-intimacy.    \n\n\nBasically, her music is so relatable that people can see themselves in her.  Those people seek out more, and her public presence gives them enough to hook them, like a bump of cocaine.  But it's not enough, so those people continue the addictive seeking behavior, which she intentionally cultivates by holding back a lot of details.  Then an album comes out and people get a big dopamine surge as the uncover the secrets revealed by her songs about her own sensational celebrity dating life.

            "As a 30 year old Swiftie, here\u2019s my attempt at an answer:\n\n1. Nostalgia: she\u2019s been around since 2006, many fans have grown up with her from teen to adult and each album she\u2019s made has corresponded to chapters of our lives\n\n2. Versatility: she\u2019s created music in many different genres, from country to pop to indie folk, with some punk pop and rock influences here and there. There\u2019s a little of everything for everyone from Taylor. \n\n3. She\u2019s stayed fairly uncontroversial throughout her career. She\u2019s relatable to her fans. \n\n4. She writes all of her own music and is known for being a strong storyteller. Fans relate to her songs in many ways. \n\n5. She\u2019s released three new albums and three re-recorded albums with new songs in just three years and is actively touring, so there\u2019s no shortage of her music to listen to, and it spans a lot of genres so there\u2019s a lot to enjoy. Her fan base especially grew after she released the indie album folklore in 2020 during the pandemic. \n\n6. She\u2019s re-recording her old albums after her masters were sold to regain ownership of her work, which not only breathes fresh life into old work but also sends a powerful statement about creative control for artists, and is allowing some of her newer fans to become fans of her old work. \n\nShe\u2019s just doing a lot right now. I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m one of her \u201ccrazy\u201d fans who is overly obsessed with Taylor herself, but I do really love her music and think she is a powerful female figure in today\u2019s world that I really admire. At the end of the day, the world\u2019s a mess but Taylor puts out music that make many of us happy in these wild times.\n\nEdit: thanks for the awards!\n\nAlso, re: 4, I never said that Taylor writes 100% of her songs herself. Yes, she has co-writers on many of them. She\u2019s still credited as a writer on every song in her discography.",
            "As a guy who gives absolutely no shits about Taylor Swift let me just say this. You are constantly hearing her on the radio year after year after year with new songs that keep making it high on lists. Most other bands and artists you hear for a bit then they disappear for a while and repeat. I am not a fan, but her musical ability to write hit after hit after hit so consistently year after year is pretty damn remarkable. She has amazing talent and work ethic.",
            "I DJ's a kids award banquet for about 100 kids (boy and girl). Once the dancing started,  I invited them to make requests.  The first 8 girls I spoke to demanded Taylor Swift.

I've never seen anything like it in my 20+ years of doing this.\n\nI also had other requests from the boys and 1 girl that told me she didn't care for Taylor Swift. \nI ended up alternating between Taylor Swift and other requests for 2 hours.  1 for 1.  Even then, whenever Ms. Swift's songs weren't playing, the girls were asking impatient questions about when I would be playing the next Swift song as well as girls arguing over which one should be played next.   \n\nI mean, I'm glad they had fun, but with my playlist being 1 artist 50% of the time, it seemed unnatural.  \n\n\nI'm happy I can tolerate her music.  \n\n:Edit: a few words that were erroious due to speech to text.",

Her first Album came out when I was 11. I didn't love it but it was okay. Her next album came out when I was 12 or 13. I loved it. Then as I grew older she kept putting out music. She changed with the times and so did I. I didn't like everything she put out but she was always there putting out very popular music and every now and then a song I really liked would come out too. A lot of these adults who love her grew up on her and so her influence was probably very very big on them growing up. She was big enough on me and I'd say I only like her, not love.",
            "Hi, Swiftie here but I\u2019m not super obsessed. For starters\u2026 it\u2019s the music. And it\u2019s not that she\u2019s the best musician ever but her lyrics are this perfect blend of autobiographical yet extremely relatable. She\u2019s also proven to be very versatile which allows her music to reach more people. If ppl sense that they can relate to something they\u2019re more likely to latch onto it. For the most part she\u2019s unproblematic. She is far from perfect but at surface level (emphasis on the surface level) there\u2019s nothing to hate about her as a person. A lot lifelong fans view her as a distant friend. \n\nAlso social media. Swifties are no different than Beatles fanatics or Deadheads. Before social media the antics of super fans were kind of things you heard about but never saw unless you went to an event yourself. Social media allows us to see everything without leaving our house.",
            "She's has the \"I'm one of you\" vibe. Her fans feel like they \"are\" her.",
            "I'm a grumpy old bugger with teenage daughters.  They like Taylor Swift a lot (particularly the younger one). \n\nI don't think the fandom is all that much different to what I remember from pop acts when I was their age.  What is the same is the comfort and support offered when someone feels a part of something.  For some that's a sport team (you cant tell me some sports fans are less infatuated that swifties), or a gaming community, or whatever.  The fact that she has so many fans just means she's tapped in to whatever makes people feel included.\n\nPersonally, I think her songs are okay.  Not something I'd listen to if it were up to me, but when in the car with the kids it doesn't bother me if they want her album played.  I think she has the occasional really good lyric and I like that she doesn't seem to take this celebrity stuff too serious (of course, that could be part of the act). But what I mainly like is the 'not gonna take any shit / girl power / live your life' vibe.  After the odd discussion with the kids I think that's what they like about her too.",
            "People just get crazy about celebrities. We've always been that way. There's nothing special about Taylor Swift fans.",
            "Never in my life have I opened Spotify, Pandora or YouTube to search for, and listen to a Taylor Swift song - But I don't find her music objectionable, and *will* listen to her top singles if they're played in a coffee shop or grocery store while I'm there..   \n\nHaving said that...\n\n..I *have* been following her \"Eras\" tour on TikTok with utter fascination.  She is *hair* away from ascending to peak-1980s Michael Jackson level as the planets' unrivaled pop superstar.  She is *filling* NFL football stadiums night after night, with overflow crowds that couldn't get tickets numbering in the thousands or *tens of thousands* dancing in the parking lots, streets and areas surrounding the stadium.  Her social media reach is *massive,* her fans unfailingly loyal, and she defies attempts to pigeonhole a demographic - Her fans rage from 5 to 85, and you see them *all* at her shows in people's social media posts, dancing, exchanging friendship bracelets, enjoying an amazing shared experience.    \n\n**..WHY?** \n\nJon Bon Jovi nailed in during an appearance on \"Larry King Live\" on CNN *years* ago when asked who the most promising up-and-coming performer was.  Without hesitation, he replied \"Taylor Swift. She's an incredible songwriter.\"  \n\n**She writes all her own music.**  This gives her an authenticity and connection with her audience, who understand her songs come from personal experiences, and the fans identify with her themes of love & heartache, loss, and joy. \n\n**She puts on incredible shows.**   Have you SEEN her tour clips on people's TikToks?  FORTY-FOUR SONGS PER NIGHT plus a few \"secret song\" deep cuts off old albums that she feels like playing?  ALMOST FOUR HOURS!?  MOST major artists on tour play 25-35 songs TOPS with a little crowd work and banter in between.   \n\n **The Economic Impact & Logistics of her tour are mind-blowing.**  It has been estimated by multiple sources that Taylor Swift is personally earning $10 million *per show.* Her tour was recently expanded out to 131 shows on 5 continents well into 2024.  This tour will push her *well* over the billionaire mark.  *This is* ***on top*** *of* ***major*** *donations to food banks and other major charities in* ***every single city on her tour.***     \nIn June, the website \"CDL Life\", for professional Drivers, stated that the *Eras* tour was using NINETY SEMI TRUCKS to move the show from city to city.  NINETY.  NINE-ZERO.   \n\nFortune Magazine stated fans pumping hundreds of millions of dollars into the economy could literally [prevent Australia from sliding into a Recession.](https://fortune.com/2023/06/27/taylor-swift-australia-eras-tour-economists-could-help-country-avoid-recession/)  \n\n\nThe Wall Street Journal has identified the Eras Tour as [\"the biggest tour in history.\"](https://www.wsj.com/articles/taylor-swift-eras-tour-money-511fdfcf)  \n\n**Taylor and her parents appear to be genuinely good people.**   Her parents, despite quietly divorcing 10+ years ago, are traveling with the tour and appear together at every single show, mingling with fans, giving out friendship bracelets, guitar picks, and taking photos with fans.  Andrea Swift gives people (coveted) MAMA SWIFT LOVES YOU bracelets while Scott Swift hands guitar picks to people with Taylor's face on them like they're at a county fair in Tennessee with 200 people in attendance.  The kids pulled from the audience by production assistants, led to the stage to receive the hat Taylor wears during \"22\" each night are chosen chosen by employees of \"TAYLOR NATION\" (her LLC) or her mother, who scan a LOT of social media in the hours before every concert.  Nearly *all* the people chosen are survivors of serious childhood illness, or remarkable young people in some way.  Fans reacting on social media universally agree show after show \"they got it right.\"  Taylor is fed the person's name into her earpiece as she's performing the song and addresses each person personally.  It's a nice touch.  \n\n[This kid is a 4-time childhood cancer survivor.](https://www.tiktok.com/@allysonnanderson/video/7251292368987524398)  She & her mom were pulled down to the floor by a Production team member for [a special moment with 80,000](https://www.tiktok.com/@allysonnanderson/video/7251288080102083886) of her friends and 17 million more watching at home.  \n\nIf you're ever having a shitty day, you're feeling lower than dirt, and you want to believe there's good in the universe again, just open TikTok and search \"22 hat\", and watch 5 or 10 of them.  \n\n# BUT WHY IS THIS TOUR SO HUGE? WHY ARE PEOPLE GOING NUTS OVER TAYLOR SWIFT?\n\n**Catharsis.**  After 18-24 months of The Pandemic nearly killing the Entertainment Industry writ large, fan reaction to Taylor Swift putting on this unbelievably massive extravaganza is nothing less than an explosive *celebration of life.*   \n\nI am personally not a Taylor Swift fan.  I don't sit down to listen to her music - But I have become *fascinated* with the cultural phenomenon of the \"*Eras\"* tour.  Watching tour video clips is like 200 CCs of Serotonin shot straight into your brain from a horse needle.  \n\nWould I go to a Taylor Swift *Eras* tour show if I had tickets?  Absolutely! It looks like a remarkable, memorable experience.  \n\n.. Every so often, the Universe gets it right.  I'm convinced that this time, it entrusted inceredible Reach and Popularity with the right person.  I see nothing but Good and Positivity in Taylor Swift's tour, and by extension, Taylor Swift herself.",
            "everything about her is generic, and most people are generic",
            "She has been consistent in her career for the past 17 years, regularly releasing music or touring. Many fans (myself included) grew up listening to her - her first album came out when I was in high school and her music has been a presence in my life all through the various stages of adulthood. She's also been relatively unproblematic. What's not to like!",
            "She's a witch, duh.",
            "She's like the Buccee's of people.",
            "I wish I knew. I guess her fans just connect with her music. I\u2019ll never understand standing outside stadiums to listen to her music. Or other popular artists who\u2019s fans have weird traditions. A lady in my office saw Dave Matthew\u2019s 3 times during the week she was off. I just always think I\u2019m sure things I do in my hobbies seem weird. I\u2019ve waited hours to get good seats so I can bake in the summer sun to watch a football team practice. Practice. They might think that\u2019s crazy. Looking back, I think it\u2019s crazy, haha.",
            "She also plants a lot of Easter eggs in her social media, music videos. She creates mystery and anticipation for new albums. \n\nAs far as I know she\u2019s the first artist to ever release a single from an album that was released 4 years in the past. That\u2019s a result of fans who listen to her stuff over and over again.",
            "She checks alot of boxes.  She is beautiful in a classic skinny blonde way.  She writes her own sad girl songs, and poppy crap.  She is talented, I give her credit.  Even though musically she is mostly not my cup of tea.  She does her thing and has been massively successful for going on 20 years now.",
            "I am a 26 y/o male.I am not obsessed but I like a lot of her songs and look forward to her new stuff. I also kind of root for her. She made apple change their decision on how they wouldnt pay artists for people using free trials. Now she's doing the herculean task of rerecording all her music to attack the slimey industry folks like scooter braun.\n\nI didn't really get her music until I first \"fell in love\". \n\nI just think she captures the essence of being in love so well. I dont like her \"catchy\" songs like Shake it off, Bad blood, etc. I like songs like \"Snow on the Beach\", \"Enchanted\", \"Betty\", \"Call it what you want\". Idunno a lot of her music is just written by her so it just feels genuine when you hear it to me. It's not about belting like mariah carrey or ariana grande, its just about how her singing how she feels.\n\nI think Taylor Swift cant be compared to people like Michael jackson and Elvis or Beatles because they were were a different type of performer and singers. Taylor maybe is more comparable to Elton John? I think the closest singer to Taylor's Style is Ed Sheeran, who is also just as big for similar reasons. They are kind of defying time. Their music is timeless. Yeah its pop but its kind of Folk-y. Gaga, Katy Perry etc all are left behind in the 2010s. Taylor has been at it since before them and still going strong with songs that everyone can enjoy.\n\nI think Madonna is the biggest female singer of all time. The closest successor to her today I think is Miley Cyrus. I listened to her latest album and watched some of her interviews. She has the vibe.\n\nIdk if any of this made sense. I just started rambling i think\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso fuck kanye west",
            "My 17 year old daughter is a swiftie.  I think she likes her cuz she is relatable and because it is something she can talk about with her friends.",
            "The thing that seems odd about the Swifties is that they go online to fight Taylor\u2019s battles with whoever she is feuding with at the moment as if they are personally offended on her behalf.  I\u2019ve never heard of any other music fan acting that way.  Fans of other artists may go to several shows and wear the t-shirts, but these fans are on another level.",
            "She just did two shows here in Cincinnati and the entire region when institutional level crazy.  Governor made an official TS day, the city gave her a key and even made MLB move the Reds game from the standard 7:10 start to a 5:05 on a Fri to accommodate the swifties\n\nGarth got none of that and he sold out 5 shows in less time than her",
            "I don't think people are more obsessed with her than any other artist. It's just fan behavior. More interesting to note, why are people so obsessed with hating Taylor swift? Is it because she comes from wealth and doesn't need to succeed at a creative career the way she does? Is it because she chooses to sing about heartbreak, a subject very easily mocked by men and derided by women who want positive attention from these same men? Is it because she can entertain them both adults and children? Children are the most honest audience and will let you know when they are bored or unhappy. Not everyone can perform for and successfully entertain children. There are many reasons people hate taylor, but most of them have to do with how well she stands on her own two feet. Had she not chosen to make a career of her own name, and simply live off her family's money people would still hate her for that.",
            "She\u2019s probably a witch",
            "Since she started so young, many of her adult fans are roughly the same age as her, and feel like they grew up with her.",
            "As a recent Swiftie, I\u2019ve found the obsession is really rooted in how genius her and her team are at creating a spectacle: their marketing is next level. \nShe has a really unique ability to make her fans actually feel like they\u2019re her closest friends. Back in the 2010\u2019s she used to invite internet fans to her house for album releases, she leaves little clues and \u2018easter eggs\u2019 to give fans hints about who her songs are about, there\u2019s so many other things she does to build that para-social  bond. She created a reward system for fans to engage in a game with her and it\u2019s worked scarily well",

            "Not sure, I\u2019m more interested in the subgroup of swifties that (unintentionally?) posts white supremacist propaganda and overtly racist things. The one post that stood out to me was the swifty that posted the N@zi eye colour experiment chart. Just search \u201cswifties racist\u201d on Twitter and you\u2019ll find a plethora of Taylor swift fans being extremely hateful.",
            "Its a cult of personality. Has happened with a lot of singers and groups over the decades.",
            "If it's any consolation I don't like her my kids don't like her no one I know is interested in her music I think it's just fan groups are very vocal about their enthusiasm for her,  And with the internet they can all connect with each other on mass",
            "People are odd. I won't ever understand celebrity worship. It's just for entertainment and distraction I guess. Makes them happy. But still, obsessing over someone who doesn't know your existence is tragic. Worship in general is a mindless thing.",
            "I honestly think there are two groups of Swift fan. The relatively normal fan that like her music and think she\u2019s a good performer. They may even have some interest in her personal life, buy a Tshirt etc. Secondly there are the (minority) that are obsessive to the point they need to purchase all the merch, every album, and they will troll and harass people in defence of some perceived slight of Taylor. This second group is so outspoken and destructive that the group seems larger than it is. Watch how many replies I get from this second group\u2026",
            "She is a Satanist spawn and has 44% of the Christian population under her spell.",
            "She\u2019s a genuine person talking about genuine struggles. Not just poppin pussies in the club",
            "Taylor Swift is unquestionably banal. She is the icon of mediocrity... Nevertheless. to a certain segment of the population... she's been elevated to this cult status because to them... she is\"safe\"..  she harkens back to an era of \"1950 gosh! golly gee willikers wholesomeness\" ...that no longer exists.. Which is ironic since swift changes bfs like tampons. (but I digress)\n\n This is why you see so many parents pissing away thousands of dollars to take lil chad and becky for the \"experience\" of a taylor swift concert.. Because for many suburbanites and midwesterners ..she embodies all that \"malt shop/small town diner\" era that no longer exists .. which they miss.",
            "Elvis or the Beatles do seem comparable, and are frankly also both incomprehensible to me.",
            "She writes songs about the most common life experiences in a vague enough way that people feel like it's about them. It's kinda like astrology, people love applying themselves to vague descriptions and pretending \"it's so accurate!\"",
            "I don't get it either.",
            "Taylor Swift overtly markets her life and particularly relationships. It makes fans think they know her. People being obsessed is her bread and butter.",
            "What I don't understand is that she's not really a strong singer like Adele, Christina Aguilara, Mariah Carey, or Whitney Houston, and she's not a strong performer like Beyonce, Shakira, and JLo (say what you will but JLo can dance). TSwift has some nice songs but nothing I find remarkable.",
            "Part of it is definitely how appreciative and interactive she is with her fans. She's always hiding little messages and Easter eggs in pretty much everything she does, so people pay attention to her with a magnifying glass to make sure they don't miss something. You can tell that she genuinely loves what she does, and she's grateful for the people who helped her get there. As far as rich white women go, she's definitely more humble than you would expect her to be. She's an incredible songwriter, and an incredible performer. She's kind of a triple threat on stage, singing live, playing her own instruments, doing actual choreo, all while doing several outfit changes in between. I think she's cancelled like, one show in her 15+ years of performing, so she's definitely dedicated to her art. She started out as a teenage girl in country music so the odds were already stacked against her a little bit, and she made the transition from country singer to true iconic pop star pretty seamlessly. And that's another part of it. She started out as a teenage girl. Her fanbase has always been comprised of mostly girls around her own age. Most of her fans have quite literally grown up with her. Obviously her music isn't going to be everyone's preference because that's how music works, but it's pretty hard to deny that she has talent leaking out her ears",
            "I think it's her fans competing with each other to be the biggest fan. As someone else said it's social media but it's social media competing with social media. Biggest fan accounts probably have some level of interaction with Taylor even if it's just likes, it's acknowledgement. \n\nThat being said, she's a beautiful all American looking girl with some great pop songs, I'm an older male so it's not for me but she has a level of charisma I've rarely seen, like Elvis - she just had it.",
            "The concerts are a giant safe space for women, they can go and feel more free than day to day life because it\u2019s large crowds of who they feel safe with. They can dress up in the fun play dress up way and let loose.",

            "She has a great marketing team and an amazing personal instinct for appearing relatable. \n\nHer image has been manufactured to appear to her fans that she could be their best friend and understand their deepest fears and thoughts on a personal level. So for her fans, Taylor Swift is like a misunderstood sister, just trying to get by in this world full of cute boys and and a patriarchy trying to keep them down!",

Her image is very vanilla so parents don\u2019t freak out and she also projects indep business woman so the 30 and 40 year old moms can get behind her music. She\u2019s cute but not \u201chot\u201d. My wife loves her. So does the 15 year old daughter. I think she has a few good songs but is mostly a snooze fest with a mediocre voice and the writing ability of an average teen ager .

The solution was to just stay awake.  I would just watch tv, read, get online, anything I could do until I couldn't stay awake any longer.  Not like \"I'm so tired I can't stay awake!  argh!\"  No, like, I literally just feel asleep at the computer, on the couch, just passed out, sometimes with only an hour or two of sleep.  I dumped so much caffeine into myself and slept in my car at lunch or retreated to the bathroom stall at the office to catch 5 or 10 minute naps.  i was basically sleepwalking through my days at the job, ti was the only way I could get through it.\n\nThese days I'm my own boss and have none of those problems.

            "It's called maturation. Next to cancer, it's the most awful thing anyone faces in life. It's the unbelievable dread of knowing you need to manage your behavior in a way that will lead to the successes you want and even feel you deserve. It hurts so bad to overcome your body's signals asking you to serve the self and to do it NOW at all cost. It hurts knowing you will miss out on chances to be with your friends knowing how unbelievably clever you have become in your understanding of the universe and your place in it, and how we can all reach a common ground if we only chilled the fuck out. It spits in the face of your understanding that you have accepted your recent failures as a consequence outside of your control. It says \"that's a bunch of shit and you know it, you need to go to bed and get up early and get your fucking act together goddamn it, it's time to stop prioritizing the cultivation of self\". It's important, it's essential, and it's genetic. You feel that way because your genes are pushing you to the next level of your maturation and cerebral ascension. You should go hug someone now because you even have this feeling. So many people are so incredibly apathetic...they never get to suffer like you do.",

            "Horses are highly social creatures.  In the wild, they live in herds of up to twenty horses with multiple adult males, and they easily accept new horses.  This is very different from packs of wolves, for example, which only have one adult male and very rarely accept members outside the family.  Horses establish hierarchy in their herds and will defer to (rather than fight) a more dominant horse.\n\nThis has many advantages for humans.  First, the horse perceives a human as a peer and accepts their attention as social interaction.  Humans, along with other animals like goats, can fulfill a horse\u2019s need for social attention.  More importantly, a horse will accept a human as the dominant animal.  In the horse\u2019s brain, it perceives the human in the same category as a higher-ranking horse.  This is common to all domesticated animals.  If the animal is unwilling to accept humans as pack members, it isn\u2019t suitable for domestication.\n\nThey are also passive enough to accept training (you don\u2019t just jump on a feral horse and ride off on it) and the more aggressive or resistant animals aren\u2019t bred in captivity.  This is in contrast to zebras, who are generally more aggressive and can rarely be trained to tolerate riders.\n\nEdit:  When I said, \u201cone adult male wolf\u201d what I meant to say was, \u201cone breeding adult male and their offspring.\u201d  Males rarely enter the pack without being born into it (although it does happen sometimes).",
            "I have broken horses to ride, and much of it has to do with starting young and slowly getting them used to the sensation of weight on their back.  Also they see other horses being ridden.  If they're raised in an atmosphere where riding is normal and expected, they don't generally resist much.",

            "Much of it comes from the fight or flight response of horses. They are \u201cflight\u201d animals and run from fear and seek comfort in herds or even people. When humans were still nomadic and agrarian, we co-mingled and started to earn trust as part of the herd. After that, they began to see we were safe. Once part of a herd, the horses started to respect humans because we could find good food, provide safety, scratch an itch, etc. Then hopping on their back came from that trust. \n\nEven in modern horse training, you have to earn the horse\u2019s trust. Yes, you CAN intimidate a horse into behaving, but it\u2019s just a matter of time before they lose their shit and become unsafe. (Think about that horrible boss you had that was inconsistent with rules, held fear over you to get things done, all stick, no carrot... people who work in those situations either work soullessly, and do bare minimum to not be in trouble or they flip the fuck out at some point in a big blow up \u2014 same idea with horses). \n\nSo, I guess it all comes down to your relationship with the horse and if the horse had prior trauma with humans. Because of this deep physiological similarities to humans and attentiveness to emotion  directly relating to their safety, horses also make GREAT animal therapists. I volunteered at a therapeutic riding center for years, and I saw these animals bring out the most beautiful moments in their patients\u2014 one was a 13 year old girl with sever disabilities, didn\u2019t talk, we started a slow trot and I was leading from the horse\u2019s head, I heard this weird sound and ask if I should stop. We kept going and the mom ran from the viewing room into the arena in tears . At this point we stop, and I\u2019m kinda nervous what\u2019s happening. Turns out that was the first time the little girl had EVER laughed. I\u2019ll never forget that moment. \n\nAnyhow, if you want to know more about the psychology of horse training, I HIGHLY recommend watching the documentary \u201c[Buck](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ighrNbl7eWY) \u201c. - it\u2019s about one of the real \u201chorse whisperers.\u201d \n\nHappy to answer any questions!\n\nEdit: thanks for the silver!",

            "It's basically down to domestication and training.\n\nHorses have been domesticated for thousands of years. Meaning they have been in close proximity to humans to be used as food, work, companions and travel. \n\nThey were initially kept for food and milk but some people may have discovered they can be ridden with time and patience. \n\nA horse is trained to be compliant with having humans and tack on its back.\n\n It takes a lot of patience and time to gain enough trust to train a horse properly. It has to be conditioned to ignore or suppress its prey animal instincts of running from predators on its back. \n\n It is trained to do any task required of it to perform for humans.\n\nYou couldn't put a rider on a wild or untrained horse as they would spook and possibly kill a person.  A wild horse will not understand what is going on and will always run from the perceived danger.",
            "Horses have a social order based on three great truths: \n\n1) someone\u2019s gotta be in charge. \n2) being in charge is a PITA.\n3) if\u2014and only if\u2014 the one in charge is totally botching the job and looking to get us all killed, then I\u2019ll step up. \n\nNow, depending on personality, some horses foist the job of leadership off on some sucker more easily than others. A few are driven to be the decision-maker; most would rather just not be bothered. \n\nInto this dynamic steps...the human. \n\nHuman asks horse to do a thing; lo and behold, if horse does it, then as a reward, some mild annoyance is removed (shhh! don\u2019t tell the horse, but the human was the one making the mild annoyance happen in the first place!). Gosh, seems like doing what this human says is really the easiest way to go. \n\nPretty soon the human is asking for some wacky shit. (Pull a cart?! sit on me?!) but hey, they\u2019ve always been right before. Rules 1 and 2, man. \n\nAaaasnd that\u2019s really the bottom line. As a trainer, you hope your horse never feels the need to act on rule #3.",
            "Horses don't allow humans to sit and ride until they've been trained. Its called breaking. First you train the horse to respond to you. \n\n* Step 1: Halter training. You rope the horse (or approach of its naturally calm) and put a halter on its head. This may take several tries. Eventually you'll get the halter on. This leads to\n\n* Step 2: lunge line. You hook a lead to the halter and start walking the horse in a circle. You stand in the middle and spin as the horse goes around you. You give verbal commands for stopping, starting, and speed. You'll know the horse is listening when it starts flipping its ears back and forth and working it's lips.\n\n* Step 3 \nAdd a saddle and continue lunge line training.\n\n* Step 4: Bit training. Teach the horse to take a bit in its mouth by sticking your thumb behind it's teeth as you slide the bit up and in. More lunging with bit in its mouth.\n\n* Step 5: The tough one. Mounting the saddle. This could take many, many tries. You always approach the horse from its left side. Keep its right side close to a fence or wall to prevent it from wheeling away from you. Climb on and after the horse accepts you, sqieeze your heels into the horse's sides along with verbal cues to start walking, and manipulating the reigns for direction changes and stops.\n\nDo this over and over, day after day, increasing speeds and directions until you feel confident the horse is properly broken.\n\nSource: Grew up breaking horses.",

Strictly speaking a support order issued in one state is not enforceable in another state. However, under the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act (URESA) that case can be referred to the district attorney's office in the state and county where you live. That DA's office will get an order for support issued in your state and county, and likely order that it be paid by wage assignment. They'll probably also tack on any payments missed in the original state as arrears. Since they're collecting on behalf of another state and county they'll usually tack a service fee onto it, as well. In addition, the state you're in would usually use their own formula for determining support, so you could be ordered to pay more than the original order required.

Any arguments I've ever heard around the personhood of the fetus are completely arbitrary and subjective. The personhood of the fetus doesn't matter, though, as ultimately, the fetus is using the body of the pregnant party without their consent assuming they weren't actively trying for a child. It is very hard to objectively and logically argue for abortion if you disagree with this line of logic, because we can just yell back and forth all day about how one of us thinks it's a person who deserves protection and the other doesn't. Neither of us are objectively correct, and both of us are arguing along arbitrary or semantic lines.\n  \nI hope this doesn't come off the wrong way, it just really seems as though there are a ton of people in this thread who haven't really thought through the logical consequences of their responses here. There seems to be a bit of a double standard being applied.\n  \nIt takes two consenting parties to make a child that both are responsible for. If the man doesn't want a kid, it seems to be quite strange that most of you would still support him supporting that kid for the rest of the kid's childhood, whereas I'm sure most of you would be horrified at the idea of forcing a woman to abort a child that the other parent doesn't want.\n  \nIn other words, assuming a man is responsible for a child he doesn't want from sex he has is like assuming the mugged person is responsible for getting mugged. It's also odd that the woman wouldn't be equally as responsible for this, as if pregnancy is something that was inflicted on her and that she has no recourse to end.\n  \nHope this make sense. I can definitely clarify and hope some people read this. I know it probably seems weird if this is the first time you've encountered this, but the logic is consistent.",
            "My take on this is more philosophical. Remember, not all contraceptives are 100%. Just because you used a type of protection, doesn't mean you're scott free to walk away. It comes with knowing that there's still a chance it won't work. So the question becomes, how will you handle the new responsibility?\n\nSex is and always will be a gamble. Just cuz you thought your chances were high doesn't mean you don't have to pay your debt. Imagine telling a Las Vegas casino dealer, \"Hey, I had 97.8% change of winning. I should've won. I don't need to pay.\" Good luck winning that argument.",

There\u2019s an actual human being growing up that without the fathers support may have an extremely tough time. It doesn\u2019t matter what the father thinks his needs are less important than the child. The child doesn\u2019t deserve to be punished because the father doesn\u2019t want them. \n\nThere is no way for the father to forfeit responsibility without also removing the mothers autonomy(if someone doesn\u2019t want an abortion it\u2019s an extreme human rights violation to force them to have one) or punishing the child. \n\nEven in the worst case scenario some crazy women is poking holes through condoms and lying about birth control it doesn\u2019t matter. That child isn\u2019t responsible for any of that and shouldn\u2019t be punished for their parents actions. Their needs outweigh anything else. Full stop. \n\nIf you are having sex with AFAB people as a AFAM person this is a possibility you have to accept. If this isn\u2019t something you are willing to deal with, either stick to oral or anal sex, have a vasectomy, or don\u2019t have sex.

This isn\u2019t something anyone\u2019s deciding it\u2019s the reality of having sex take it up with evolution if you have a problem with it. Evolution really really wants you to have sex and make babies and until male birth control becomes a thing putting a dick into a vagina is always going to come with the possibility of making a human by mistake. \n\nAnd again, because this is worth repeating, **the second a child is born, the needs of the parents, be in emotional, finical, or finical take a back seat to the child\u2019s needs.**",

He did spray his stuff, but I expect the advice he gave me would work for a vegan; it's kept my house free of ants since then: \"the ants are eating your house because they have *motive* and *opportunity*. You have a piece of wet, rotten siding. They love soft, moist wood, so they're drawn to that. Second, a branch from the tree in your yard touches your roof, making a bridge for them. Fix the siding and cut back the branch, and they'll go elsewhere\"",

            "I can\u2019t speak for everyone but a lot of vegans and animal rights activist are against _the cruel or unethical treatment of animals_. There is a big difference in confronting a wild animal or pests in a collision of living turfs and breeding animals in horrendous circumstances, causing unnecessary suffering and an untimely and often cruel death that is mostly motivated by human convenience. \n\nAs for pests, the best way is to try to get rid of them as humainly as possible without harming or killing them (relocating them, isolating yourself better, making the environment less attractive for them..). If there is truly no other option then getting rid of them in the most ethical way is the way to go.",
            "Vegan here\nObviously opinions vary here, but at least for me, I'm not gonna kill or harm an animal unnecessarily. The key being unnecessarily. I have every right to defend myself, or my home. I'm not gonna live in a wasp nest/ant infested home lol. I'll let spiders out and such but things like ant infestations are just completely impractical to consider trying to \"relocate\".\n\nEDIT: I'm getting a ton of comments regarding the following question: essentially, is it okay to harm animals if it is sufficiently convenient?\nI admit, the way I worded this was a tad lazy on my part, didnt really expect the comment to blow up, so I'll put it this way:\nIt's not necessarily about convience, as opposed to necessity. Theres a difference. \nThere are cases in which it is virtually (or quite literally) impossible to relocate pests. Certain pests are not too much to worry about, say ants. Albeit like any other pest, there are health risks associated. \nHowever, for the more pressing cases, say termites, rats, mosquitos... these actually pose serious threat. Health threat, a threat to the structural integrity of ones home, contamination of food, etc...\nIf you want to avoid extermination, which I would agree, should be a last resort, the first step is to DETER these pests. Dont create an environment theyll be prone to wanting to live in. EX: Dont leave food out, Take care of your home (make sure it isnt rotting/have water damage), possibly even use some kind of other deterrents (some people were saying cinnamon? Lol)\nBut maybe you've done all these things,  and despite this, you have an infestation. \nSomething like mice? That's easy. Just trap, and release. No need for an exterminator realistically.\nSomething like termites? How do you expect to catch them? Not only do you have zero idea of where they even could be, but there could be THOUSANDS of them. You expect to scoop them up one by one? Not to mention, you dont think they're finding their way right back? (They're small enough to fit through some small cracks)\nThere is no reasonable way you will actually get rid of them, and time is of the essence. They can do serious damage to the structural integrity of your home, and as consequence, possibly you\n\nSomething like mosquitos, I just kill on sight, no mercy. Not tryna get malaria or something.\n\n\nSomeone else mentioned something like (and forgive me cuz I honestly didnt read the full comment) \"if a cow broke into your home, would you kill it?\"\nWell no, not if it could be avoided. An exterminator, or violence of any kind, should be a last resort. But that doesnt mean it shouldnt be an option period\nWith this cow, I dont see any reasonable way to suggest that I'd need to kill it. Unless somehow it became some kind of \"him or me\" thing in which I'd have to kill it in order to not die myself. But that's grasping at straws.\nHowever, if say, I was starving on a desert island with only a pig,  and zero of anything else to eat... sorry pig lol. In such a case, it's my life or his. I have every right to preserve my own.",
            "We were vegetarian or vegan for around 12 years. I still don't buy fur; I will get turtles out of the road, save drowning worms and the lot. That being said, if it tries to eat me or bite me, it's a goner. You're not my food, and I'm not yours. \nI'm not a murderer by nature, but if you break into my house and try to eat me, I might shoot you, ya know? That's just my thought on it.",

These people are nuts.\n\nEdit: I used to repair hot tubs. I was in Boulder, Co and opened the panel on a tub and there were wasps all over. The homeowner wouldn't let me use wasp spray. She insisted on spraying the nest with some essential oil (lavender?). I told her it will be $95.00 and to call me back when they were gone. Kind of a double standard as her house was cut into the side of the mountain at the edge of town. Had to be at least 3000 sqft. and well over a million dollars (this was about 2002). If she was such an environmentalist why the big house encroaching on wildlife with a hot tub that uses enormous amounts of energy to run. Land of fruits and nuts!",
            "There\u2019s a big difference from veganism or activism to what your describing, sounds more like Jainism, which is a sect of Buddhism or something.  Even the staunchest vegan I know wouldn\u2019t tolerate roaches.",
            "Veganism is the philosophy of reducing animal suffering to its lowest possible by reasonable means. This categorically includes stopping to support the meat and dairy industry, the fur industry, poaching, sport hunting, the animal-testing cosmetic industry and all other industries that harm animals. Do this and you have dramatically reduced unnecessary animal suffering, congratulation.\n\nAs I said, anything before this is categorical. Afterward comes morally gray areas that begin to conflict with our living standards, and this includes extermination services. Ask many vegans and you'll get many different answers. Most would tell you that they would seek the best compromise that align with their morals but that doesn't automatically excludes using extermination services.",
            "I used to have a friend who was Hindu and would not intentionally harm anything at all. He had a mouse in his apartment and did all he could to discourage it from staying but his faith forbid him from harming it. If the apartment complex managers hired an exterminator to kill it, it didn't make him happy but he was not the actor in that situation and so he could sleep soundly.  He may have been a but more pragmatic than any given activist.",
            "If you're asking this in good faith, you should probably try asking in a vegan or anti-speciest community.\n\nI am both but honestly, I have no clue what I would do. It's honestly a huge dilemma. I wouldn't want to hurt the animals but if the only other option is losing my housing, I may have to decide to do it. If I were rich as heck or if housing weren't commodified, I might just let them have it.",

            "Veganism is a way of living which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose.\n\nMost vegans are not the crazy militants that the stupid vocal minority unfortunately paint the rest of us as.  We in fact hate those people as much as everyone else, if not more.\n\nSo to answer your question I would see if there was a alternative to killing the invasion pests.  However being a practical person, I'd take the approach of doing the least collateral damage possible.",
            "It\u2019s impossible to be 100% vegan. Using a phone or driving a car is not vegan, but you need to use those things to be able to function in the modern world. I can live a happy healthy life and not have to buy a leather jacket, I can\u2019t if I\u2019m not able to drive a car to get to work . Most vegans would eat animals if it was a survival type situation. So if ants are invading your home there is nothing wrong with stoping that.",

            "They would shove the invaders up their butthole announcing \"MY HOME IS YOUR HOME\"",
            "I'm not vegan or even vegetarian, but just don't want to poison or touch any pests. We have two cats and so far they've done a great job on pest control. Any critter, mouse, bug, fly etc that gets indoors is dead in minutes. We guide more dangerous things like wasps outdoors with a cup and a paper but anything else is free range for the kitties. Just the precense of cats tend to keep mice and rats away.",

            "You will find advice to locate the place the ants are coming in and plug that up, and also various ant repellant suggestions (orange oil, coffee grounds) for keeping them off surfaces. The repellants only work for a short time and sometimes you cannot get to whatever hole they're coming in through. In this case your options are keeping food sources out of the house and hoping they go away, living with it forever, or extermination.",
            "I have found \"green\" ways to get rid of pests. I have dogs so I don't want to lay down any poison in or out of my house. I use Diatomaceous Earth for ants roaches or other household pests. The Diatomaceous Earth works great for all the centipedes, and other outside creepy crawlers. I also have a spray bottle with Dawn dish soap and water. I use that on the flies and the wasps. My backyard faces a huge field, so there is all kinds of things emerging from there. I get field mice too. I use essential oil in the places I see they like to go. They cannot stand the odor of the essential oils.  (I'm not vegetarian)",
            "I'm not officially vegan but we do try to stick to as little animal products as possible. But for me though animal welfare is part of it, climate is a bigger reason. So while I try to catch rats and mice alive, if I have ants in the house, they get killed. Not by something that's bad for the environment though.",
            "I think people have lots of reasons to be vegan. The motivation I have had to try being vegetarian are more focused on the environment than the animals. It is a much cleaner carbon foot print to avoid eating meat. So, I can absolutely see how a person could be vegan, but have no problem with exterminating pests. Similarly, I feel animal rights activists are often interested in the humane treatment of domestic animals. A person can want animals treated humanely, but still be alright with exterminating pests like ants. Especially since there are humane methods of pest control."

            "My Brother in law died in bed 7 weeks ago. No significant sickness beforehand and no previous conditions and no warning. He left my sister after 1 month of marriage, a seven year old stepson and his son only 9 months old. Devastating. I won\u2019t ever forget seeing him in the casket while physically keeping my sister on her feet. He had everything going for him. Family, friends, his band were due to head off on tour the same day as his funeral. Live while you can people - he did and damn I\u2019m glad he did",
            "The first person I know who died (that wasn't due to a car wreck) was a 24 year-old friend who had an aneurysm and died a couple days later. He was a vegetarian. He didn't drink much, and AFAIK only smoked a couple cigs in his teens. No family history of aneurysms, either. Bitch of it was, it happened 2 days before his health insurance was due to kick in, so he got minimal care. Even worse, his employer didn't seem to care in the least. \"He's on the verge of dying? Oh fuckin' well, LOL!\" My friend was an imagineer at WDW.\n\nI had a mild heart attack last year, at 49. I've had digestion issues for years, and that night I ate a mesquite BBQ pork roast from the Crock Pot. I sprinkled Tabasco Scorpion sauce on it, which is hot AF. About an hour later, I felt the World's Worst Indigestion\u2122 coming on. But no amount of Gas-X or Pepto Bismol seemed to help. And I couldn't get comfortable - sitting down, standing up, lying down... it all hurt. My wife had gone to bed early, and I didn't want to wake her. I eventually made it to sleep, but tossed and turned much of the night. \n\nI told her about it the next morning, and she insisted we go to the hospital. Well, there's some enzyme they test for. I forget the name, but in normal people, the enzyme level should be between 0.5 and 1.0. Mine was 17.3! \n\nI'm fine now. They put a stent in through my wrist; it's amazing that the entire procedure only took 45 minutes and I was wide awake for it. My cardiologist wants me to walk 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week, which I do. I've lost around 30 pounds, and have gone from a 38\" waist pants to 36\" and now to 34\". I don't eat as they want me to, but I have ditched caffeine (mostly), soda (largely) and cut down on sodium.\n\nIf I have one piece of advice, it's this: a) go to the damn doctor. I hadn't gone in 20 years before my heart attack, and now I have a GP and regular visits and all that; and b) \"I thought I was having a heart attack but it was just gas\" was a trope in 70s sitcoms, but it can be for real. I thought a \"heart attack\" would be dramatic chest pains, like in the movies and TV shows. It wasn't I just thought my belly and Tabasco were having a fight. They weren't.",
            "Well, it's not exactly randomly. It's uncommon, but you could have a heart attack at a young age and die. There will be a reason for it, like some congenital condition.",
            "In theory yes, in practice when it happens it turns out that they had an undiagnosed condition which caused it, so as long you take care of your health and pay attention then you should \\*probably\\* be fine. \n\nApparently high blood pressure is particularly bad for this, being potentially deadly and easy to overlook if you don't have your BP checked regularly.",
            "You could die suddenly but everything has a reason. Your immune system could break down or other things can happen and you might will be dead from one to the other second",
            "Theoretically, yes. There had been more than a few recorded cases of people dying of sudden heart attack, stroke or cardiac arrest, seemingly out of nowhere. Some infections can also kill extremely fast - sometimes in matter of hours. Allergic reactions \\[which you never realized you had\\] can also result in a very fast death.\n\nHowever, in many of those cases, it isn't so much \"literally out of nowhere\", as much as it is \"the conditions for it were there for a while, but weren't noticed by anyone\". Sometimes because there was really no reason to look at them, and sometimes due to neglect or dismissal of early signs/risk factors.\n\nYou can't protect yourself from all of those, and you can't test every tissue in your body for everything - but you CAN act within reason to protect yourself from likely risks by doing regular checkups, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, educating yourself on risk factors, paying attention to your body and taking note of any new issues, even when they seem minor.",

            "Yes. My childhood friend died at 29. Had been active her whole life, was healthy, had a good support system with family and friends, money in the bank account and someone that had their entire life ahead of her\u2026and she just fell down dead one morning.  \n\nThe worst of it was that she had a 6 month old little girl. The father was involved but not living with her and the baby at the time. They were working through their issues and were committed to building a future for their daughter and all of that was ripped away with no warning. She had called her mom the night before her death explaining she had a headache and would like her mom to come over to help with the baby. It was late so they agreed she would come first thing in the morning. Her mom knocked, no answer but could hear the baby crying so she used her spare key and walked in to find her daughter dead on the kitchen floor. They think it was heart attack but the autopsy came back inconclusive (to be honest I didn\u2019t ask too many questions about it since the family was going through enough). I wasn\u2019t close to her in the later years of her life but I\u2019ve known her parents since I was a kid and I\u2019ve never seen hurt like that in someone\u2019s eyes. She was her mother\u2019s only daughter and I really have never been able to make sense of it. There was no preexisting condition, no indicators that anything was wrong, like she\u2019s 29, who has a heart attack at 29? \n\nThe little girl is sharing custody with the father and my friends family so she will have a lot of love and support but she won\u2019t have her mom. \n\nIt made me think that being young isn\u2019t a guarantee of a future. We aren\u2019t owed more time just because we\u2019ve only experienced a fraction of what someone older has. I hope my friend is at peace, her little girl is doing well and know the family will do everything they can to make sure her mother\u2019s memory won\u2019t be forgotten.",
            "Yes. Brain aneurysms are the scary completely random killer. I knew someone my age who died suddenly from one a few years ago at age 26 or 27. I believe that's also what killed Grant from the Mythbusters right around the same time. There are plenty of other ways to die at any age as well. Really anything that kills old people can kill younger people too, just at a much lower probability, but with 8 billion people on earth someone will likely end up with the bad luck. But few are quite so sudden as the brain aneurysm. You go from fine to dead in minutes rather than the days to hours (often with possibilities to get to a hospital and survive) for things like infections, intestinal blockages, heart problems, aggressive cancer, etc.",
