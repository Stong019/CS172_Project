            "I'd be more anxious if I heard a car door shut inside my house.",
            "Probably stems from me knowing if I hear a car door right outside, it's my mom. I was grounded a lot as a kid and was told not to touch my consoles. I played those mfs anyway and was slick about it. I'd turn them off the second I'd hear my mom pull up and pretend to be reading or something.",
            "I 100% do this! But i live on the ground floor of a small block of flats, so it happens constantly. Who knows why it makes me so anxious, but it does. Mental health is a joy",

            "I do. \n\nWhich is why when I moved into my new place I set it up so no one can come to my door unless I want them to. I built a fence around my front yard and connected it to a utility building beside my house. The only way into my yard is through that utility building, which is also my laundry room, and which I keep locked when I'm home. So literally no one can just walk up to my front door. \n\nNo Mormons, no Jehovah's Witnesses, and no cops.",

Garbage collection was this morning in my neighborhood, and the guys shout to each other while going up the street, and I always have anxiety every week when they do that. \n\nI worry when I hear shouting outside that it's about me or it's the police. I have a neighbor who gets drunk and yells stuff at my house because he doesn't like me (he doesn't like anyone in the neighborhood and yells stuff at everyone when he gets drunk) and that doesn't help matters.",

And I just hate talking to people and trying to act like I care about anything they have to say. Alcohol helps; that\u2019s why I don\u2019t remember most of my twenties and don\u2019t drink now, and therefore don\u2019t socialize unless I have to.  If I had discovered Zoloft instead of Vodka I\u2019m my late teens I would probably be a doctor or lawyer now.",

Anyone whos going to drive 3 hours to come here will call first. So its some that I dont know. I want to hide. Unless its ups lol.

Some days I'd find them in the house randomly just doing work or showing people around etc. It wasn't until I threatened them with legal action that they stopped but this was 3/4 of the way through the year and now I can't relax in my own home. Pretty annoying but I hope it passes soon",

I've had a really toxic neighbour that made my life like hell because he didn't know how to behave in flats with little acoustical isolation, especially at night when he couldn't sleep and decided to watch TV on the room just above our bedroom. That thing amongst many others. \n\nEach time I heard its car door, I knew I would have a bad night. Fortunately, we moved out, but I'm still triggered by car doors shutting.",

(We live on a very busy street that connects 2 freeways whose speed limit is 35, should be 25, and where people routinely go 40-60.)\n\nMy heart stops every time I hear tires braking, expecting the worst. \n\nI used to be a lot more wary of car doors shutting when I lived in a dead-end complex, but now I\u2019ll look outside and see an Uber driver sleeping in their car blocking our driveway at 3am.

            "I'm not bothered by car doors shutting, but any time I hear a distant shouting, especially inside a building, I immediately go into panic mode. Heart racing, looking around anxiously, it is awful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy mother used to yell at me through walls and doors to call me and give me orders to do everything around the house for her. She was so lazy, she couldn't be bothered to even get out of her bed to go tell me to my face what new responsibilities I had each time. If I didn't hear her yelling for whatever reason and she did have to actually get up and come to ME, she would become quite abusive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo now anytime I hear a distant, faint yelling, it freaks me out so badly. I have to fight the urge to go running toward it to see if i'm being called.",
            "I swear there's someone in my neighborhood that slams car doors for fun. It's been happening my whole life. You'd think if a whole family just came home you'd hear 3 or 4? More. Someone's out here slamming the door several times just to piss me off.",

I'd moved to a new apartment on the edge of the city with no resident parking. Not a huge deal because there was usually plenty of street parking, and with everything within easy walking or bus range I rarely drove.. which was a problem because the city would ticket you if you stayed in the same spot for 72 hours and I was always forgetting to move the car until the sound of the tow truck doing the rounds reminded me.

I've confronted some of them and I've gotten a few licks in and taken a few for my trouble cause it was the same 5~6 people so it eventually stopped after I finally managed to get the cops involved. I'd have moved but that's not possible or a practical solution for a few people who seem to make it their personal mission to be monumental inconsiderate assholes making everyone elses living situation worse.\n\nEvery single fucking noise set me on edge for a long time and I have misophonia so I'm not really all that capable of just filtering it all out.

He finds contracts at a local inn For jobs like how they do it in final fantasy tactics. I like doing it that way because it keeps the adventures very open ended.\n\nThese days tho im imagining him building stuff. Probably because im back to my building hobbies.

Less to sleep and more as normal brain activity than anything else.\n\nMy usual scenario is me being a character who emerges at a vital point during an anime who holds a lot of power and pivotal plot points, sort of like the Marleyans in Attack on Titan, though typically not in an antagonist position lol.\n\nIf not stories constructed in my head, then it\u2019s looots and looooooots of music, mainly metal.

And I was like no, I don't know the way, I've never done that. The way I fall asleep (paradoxically) is by engaging in thought. I play a movie in my head, of which I'm usually the main character and eventually dose off to that.\n\nMy theory is this creates a smooth transition into a dream which is why it works.",

It has been extremely therapeutic and expanded my knowledge of society and the pivotal advancements in civilization. \n\n\nBasically, I am a time traveler that experiences a apocalyptic event that destroys earth. I go back in time from the earliest points of human existence and incrementally inject technological advancements that are feasible in that era. I then travel to the future again to see if the advancements have created the required knowledge and technology to thwart the cataclysmic event. Then I travel back in time in a new era, one hundred years or so, and inject new, feasible advancements in that time period. Rinse and repeat further and further in time. I have yet to reach my goal and donor wish to. I do go back to different eras and replay different scenarios. \n\nIRL: This process has also caused me to research technologies, be it Wikipedia reading, but I have gained a greater understanding and appreciation for the human story",

Have a small speaker by your pillow, (or earbuds headphones if comfortable and you don't sleep alone) \n2.  Audio books. I find ones read by a soothing voice best. Neil Tyson's astrophysics for people in a hurry is fantastic, as is anything read by Stephen Fry. \n3.  Put it on play with a sleep timer.

When that isn't doing the trick,because sometimes I can't get it right in my mind, I hit baseballs and softballs. It's crazy but there's something so peaceful about striking a ball just right.

No idea why. I just imagine a kid jumping around on school desks. I try to let my mind wander from there and not directly guide it. Not sure if it really helps.

They think that I hate to bring with \u201cfamily\u201d but that not the case at all I enjoy being with my family but I just don\u2019t like talk.

            "Remember that you don't have to deal with all the world's problems. Educate yourself, but don't take all the awful things you hear onto your shoulders. Focus on your world and the things you do every day, and if you try your best to make a positive difference to the people around you and make decisions that are in line with your morals and values, then that's enough. Use the information you learn to better yourself and develop your inner compass. Go with the flow and focus on creating positivity no matter what ends up happening. That's all you can do\n\nEDIT: To be clear, I'm not saying \"do nothing\". I am saying, don't let the world depress you. Don't think that nothing will ever change. If you make a decision to better yourself, help someone else, help the environment, then you made a big change in your corner of the world! I read a good comment that summed it up: \"I can't save the world but I can save my piece of it.\" And voting is incredibly important and please do that if you can!",
            "I\u2019d say to just take it in small amounts. I like news radio for that. In 20 minutes you have the weather, traffic, local news and then whatever significant is going on in the world. \n\nThen pick a newspaper you like and get a daily email with their headlines.",
            "Things are bad now but they will get better. I grew up during Vietnam, Nixon impeachment, and double digit inflation. My mom grew up during world war 2 and the depression. I guess my point is every generation has to deal with some serious shit and we are going through this with you. Keeping up with this mess is all but impossible.",
            "Here's a thing I've learned to do, which really helps - all that anger and righteousness? That's a bunch of people trying to fix bad situations. It's easy to feel helpless and depressed about everything, but the fact everyone's angry means that things aren't being accepted as normal. These are exceptional circumstances, and it's great to see that people aren't just rolling over and accepting it.\n\nSure, there's bad people knocking around, but there's a lot of good too. The latter is worth focusing on.\n\nAnd to echo a lot of other people, don't try and keep up with rolling news (be it social media, or news channels, or having updates from apps). Take in the news when you're able to handle it, and don't get worked up by hysteria.\n\nThere's good folk everywhere, it's just that they're not being written about right now, so remember that the news is skewed towards things that aren't normal.",
            "No cable TV and no opinion columns. Choose a couple of respected news sources, preferably print (online is ok), not from the extreme end of any political side, and pay attention on how they report the same story. You'll be able to suss out the facts from any remaining bias pretty easily.\n\nAnother idea is to read the news about the US from other countries's news orhganisations, for example, the BBC, the Guardian or any English-language source. They tend to be less biased, focus on the bigger picture and have more of an outsider's more neutral and factual perspective. And they do not pay attention to every minute detail, so you won't get depressed by every tweet and outrageous comment.\n\nAnd you'll learn stuff about the rest of the world which is always a bonus.",
            "Be very careful where you're getting your news from.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nModerate yourself on how much news you're watching/reading per day (I like to limit it to my morning coffee, which may or may not include a podcast on the way to work.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVote in every election you've access to. The local elections have more of an influence on your life than POTUS does.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVolunteer your time towards a single cause you'd like to help with. (This helps fight the feeling that you're contributing either directly or indirectly to all the bad things going on.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFight for what you feel is right, but choose your battles carefully.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKeep your mind open, but when pressed - Agree to disagree.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinally, and most importantly, You may think things are bad - They are only objectively so. It could be better, yes, but it could also be a lot worse.\n\nImagine living in a country where instead of going to school, you work in a sweatshop - And that sweatshop existing in your neighborhood IS AN IMPROVEMENT. 1 dollar a day!? You'll be able to eat like 4 times a week!! Before the sweatshop opened, you'd harvest worms to sell, which would double as dinner should you fail.\n\n(For the record i'm not advocating sweatshops... just making a point)\n\nWe've never been more advanced than we are right now. Humans are going a little crazy with access to all this tech and knowledge. Remember... we've always been a tribal species - don't expect homo sapiens to fix a problem as quickly as a triple-A game releases a bugfix (and you'll get plenty of humans bitching about the speed of that, btw).\n\nSome problems require tens of millions of people to fix. Getting that many people together is hard. But every year that passes that problem shrinks due to technology. A modern farmer can  tend a field THOUSANDS of times larger than his 200 year old equivalent could. A modern weapon can kill tens of thousands of times more effectively than a spear.\n\nThis lesson applies to everything. We have the capability to fix every problem we face - from homelessness to climate change. It will take time, hard work, and patience to do so. It may be 200 years before we, as a species, get to the point *you* currently see as \"Ideal.\" And by that time, I can pretty much guarantee that humans will be pissed about something else.\n\nTemper your expectations. Accept that humans are flawed, petty, and stupid. Accept that humans are incredible, selfless, and intelligent. For every bad thing that exists, good exists. For every awful crime against humanity, there are things we do and create that are so beautiful it will bring you to tears.\n\nMy parting advice? Do what you can. Have conversations. Open your mind. Do not expect things to change quickly. And when things do change quickly, adapt as best you can.",

Unless you can dedicate your entire life into making a change, which many of us including me are either too weak, too poor, or too depressed to do.",
            "Great question, I study international relations in college. And I think this major really fucked me up emotionally to some extent. I was forced to know politics, constantly following up big news. It is really a sad experience, I become more pessimistic about our future and just human beings in general. I used to be a happy person, now I am not. It is a paradox, the more you know the less happy you become. \n\nMy way to balance it is to feed myself some really stupid but funny shit. Like browsing on YouTube for prank videos after a long day. Or just watch some lighthearted shows or anime.Take yourself out of that emotion of being sad and frustrated. You had that feeling means you are a somewhat sensitive person I suppose. It\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing, a lot of people just don\u2019t give a shit about what\u2019s happening in the world. Anyway, try talking to somebody older than you, get some advice from them.",
            "With the choice of words in your title, it sounds like you could be clinically depressed even if you did shut off the news because depression is a terrible disease that likes to make itself worse.  I never lost hope and I am a terrible news junkie, even when my lifelong depression was untreated.\n\nCompartmentaliize it first.  You have to make time for self care, learn coping skills, volunteer for the stuff you care about to make a difference, find friends that care about the things you care about, and I suggest talking to a doctor about this.\n\nWhen you get to these things and beat it, you'll feel great about what you're doing because you have the energy to fight it.  Good luck, I'm rooting for you.",

            "First thing you should do is steer clear of mainstream media news outlets (CNN, MSNBC, FOX, etc.) They are entertainment television maquerading as news. Youtube has some great outlets that cover the issues and can give you useful information on what's going on in Washington DC. Start with Democracy Now or maybe The Young Turks and only click on the vids that are of particular interest to you.",
            "Apathy is what has gotten us where we are, and believe me, it's not hard to sink into that grey cloud.  Everything seems so screwed up, where the hell do we start? How the hell do we get through this without getting buried or just going numb?  Pick one thing, just one, the thing that means the most to you, and get involved.  Join some groups, online or in real life, look for sane ones, that's very important, there are rabids every group, no matter how benign it might seem, but the good ones are out there.  \n\nStay informed on the issues that each candidate presents and look at their past history, and then VOTE!  Get everyone to VOTE! I don't care who they vote for, but vote.  Right now there is just the smallest percentage of available voters actually voting so guess who gets catered to?  And politicians feel safe because all they have to do is cater to that small percentage and they are in.  Maybe that can be your thing?  Get everyone to vote, doesn't matter who they vote for, just so long as their voice is heard.\n\nI think the worst thing for all of us right now is that we just feel so helpless and ineffectual.  Maybe, if we could change that?",
            "You know who you want to vote for, right? In terms of the impact on the world, you being informed on the minutia right now vs. only having a general sense of what is going on doesn't make a lot of difference.\n\nWhich isn't to say it isn't good to be informed, it's just ok to balance it against self care and stay at more of a distance.\n\nFind a 1 hour news radio show or podcast that hits the big headlines & that you find to be not too agitating. Listen to that and then spend the rest of your attention on other things.\n\nIn the early years of my illness, I'd get so upset about Bush and the war that I would have episodes.

Do what you can, vote, protest, whatever you feel you need to do to safely be involved.  \n\nBut also remember to step away, read some posts on r/animalsbeingbros or something similar. It's okay to not obsess over it.  \n\nPolitics doesn't change overnight, if you go on vacation for a few days, the world won't end.  It will be here when you get back.  \n\nIf it does end, then there's no worries there.  \n\nOne of the best bits of advise I ever read was from a kung-fu comic, \"do the little to achieve the great\".

            "Read the news from another country. It usually has a clearer idea what\u2019s going on.",
            "This is what I do: \n\n**Read the article to about halfway**. After the halfway point is when the meat of the story is concluded and supporting info or related info start getting piled on. Then move onto another one.\nAlternatively, once you have a firm grip about what is going on, just skim headlines. You might be able to go 2 or 3 days without actually reading an article.\n\n\n**Avoid opinion pieces** - it\u2019s sometimes hard to tell the difference, but avoid them because they are not factually relevant and often paint a scary or sad picture. Sometimes the URL will say opinion or just under the author\u2019s name it would say it. \n\n\n**Recognize media bias and learn to spot the facts by looking at more than one source.** Almost all media outlets are biased to some degree - a lot are just left of centre (centre meaning no bias at all). Some are really left and are essentially left-wing propaganda. And it\u2019s the same for the right (although there are less right of centre and more right wing propaganda sites). I use a [media bias fact check](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/) page (easiest way to use it is google \u201cmedia bias (outlet name)\u201d) where they put the site/outlet on a spectrum and give them a grade and explain why. So I know that Washington Post is pretty left leaning, but tend to get the facts straight.\n\nThen I go to another site, sometimes even a site that I know is right leaning (Fox news) and I look for their version (if it exists) and figure out what is the same between the two sources. Exp: WaPo says Trump pressured Ukraine to dig up dirt on Biden, CNN says the same, and Times says the same, then it must have happened. If CNN says Trump also asked Turkey to dig up dirt, but no one else is reporting it, then it\u2019s still a developing story or CNN botched it and false reported.\n\n\n**Don\u2019t let it get personal for you**. I\u2019m a journalist (us citizen living in Canada) and the day Trump called all media enemies of the people, I felt personally attacked. It took me a week or so to mostly shake that feeling: I will never report on him and so let him say what he wants - he\u2019s mostly full of shit and and I know I\u2019m doing my best to be fair and balanced. \nUnless you are specifically named or a category you fall into is specifically identified (exp: ICE is sweeping through your state grabbing illegal immigrants and you are a legal immigrant - they have a history of arrest first, sort them out later), be emotionally distant about the story. If you read a story that is not an opinion piece, but starts by talking about a specific person (immigration story that starts with a little girl), then know ahead of time that it is supposed to twist your feelings and make you mad and angry at politicians and sad and sympathetic for others.\n\n\n**Understand what you can actually do to change the country/world** Climate change is scary. Washington is infuriating. Russia and China can be terrifying. But little ole you can not do anything about it yourself. But you can do little things that can have a big impact. So do the little things, and don\u2019t worry about the big ones. Like the last tip, don\u2019t let it get personal and feel like you have to fix it all because it\u2019s not your job and it\u2019s not feasible. Which is not to say don\u2019t get involved: if you are passionate about a cause, get out there.\n\n\n**Unless you can really control those feelings of panic/helplessness, avoid 24hr news stations.** They are designed to get you to watch for updates and stay tuned and make almost absurd use of \u201cBreaking News\u201d to keep you there. Sure toss one on if something crazy is happening, but just be aware that they want to manipulate you into staying tuned even when there is no need to.\n\n\n\n**Instead watch your local newscast** These are (in theory) people that live in your community, and you should support them by watching their broadcasts. They also have the ability (usually) to pick and choose what is relevant to their viewers and will skip over big world events for the national broadcast that follows so that they can focus on the more local events. \n\n\n**Consume media in controllable doses.** I get a pretty high dose of media because of my job, so I read articles, watch clips, listen to podcasts, will watch the 24 hr stations for a few minutes as I walk past or stretch. But I also know when enough is enough and turn it off and go play video games, read a book, or watch movies/tv. \n\nIt\u2019s all about knowing your limits and working inside that limit, but also sometimes pushing against that limit to make it grow larger.",

            "The election of 2008 made me think the world was literally coming to an end. I was so worried about President Obama's politics and the aftermath of what I saw history predicting and in the end, after eight years and all the politics unfolding ... I was right (except about the \"literal\" part of \"end of the world\" ... Now you're post sounds more left-wing so hang in there on this, it is honestly an attempt to be uplifting).\n\nBut yes, after eight years, EVERYTHING was wrong; from day one to the very end. Then President Trump was elected which I thought would just extend the damage further and America was done ... So I quit. I couldn't take the sleepless nights anymore so I gave up. I figured the end was unavoidable, the tribes were formed and poised for battle, and I was going to just have to spend my last few years trying to enjoy the few moments I had left. I tried to find hobbies and stayed away from news altogether for about three months. When told anything related to politics I'd smile and just tell myself to go watch cartoons or study something in my career field. Then after those three months passed I realized something ... I was seriously happy.\n\nNow this may sound like I'm saying to stay out of politics completely but that's not it. In fact, I read news once or twice a week and I'm still happy, I still have my political views, and I think I may even vote again in 2020. But I realized that the trouble with politics wasn't the politics, it was me. I had allowed the cultural belief that I needed to \"change the world\" create a pressure on me that made me feel like I was losing millions of battles a day to evil (what I read in the news) while in reality, I was doing fine. I had a job, I had loved ones, I could enjoy my time how I wanted and the dire state if impending doom in this world was actually only in my head. I do more for charity now than ever before and enjoy it because I'm helping out of love again; not pressure to \"change the world.\" I'm sure I'm more pleasant to be around now too which just feels better than feeling like I need to \"educate\" everyone or \"wake them up.\"\n\nLong story short, I realized that the world didn't need me to save it, it just needed me to be the best me I could be. All the world's problems existed before I arrived on this Earth and they will all be here when I leave. While that sounds apathetic it is actually a fact of relief that we are all free to enjoy life without the guilt of not making this existence perfect. \n\nIf it helps, I am also religious and realized that in a life where I am expected to \"change the world\" I am merely one person in the vast history of mankind with a pointless life. But knowing that God made me with a specific purpose I can proudly say that just by being myself I am serving the world in a unique way that only I can fulfill. That's pretty uplifting to know that just by loving others as I do, I am changing the world as intended.\n\nI really hope that helps. If not, please know my intentions were good.",

            "What helps me is knowing that virtually nothing in politics has a *huge* impact on your life. Sure, healthcare and addressing the student loan debt in a way that makes sense and is fair would be great, but at the end of the day all you need to focus on is yourself. As of right now, in spite being in bad shape, you still could get a minimum wage job and live a great life if you're financially responsible and fairly calculative on where you choose to live. Sometimes it's not a choice and therefore minimum wage might make it impossible to rent an apartment even when sharing rent with others and also difficult to save up money to move, but even then watching politics shouldn't be your source of \"hope\" for change, you need to internalize that and focus on how you're going to make it with current conditions. Let's be honest, things could get worse depending on politics but that should be a motivator to push yourself, not a fuel source for whether you feel good or bad. Feel good for being successful, feel bad for things not going according to plan. Let the feel bad be a motivator to chase the good, not a motivator to give up and accept being depressed.\n\n\nIt's worth noting, however, it's not *normal* to watch politics and be depressed. Outraged, sure, but depressed? If you are feeling depressed by politics, chances are politics are just *more* bad news in your life and your depression is caused by something else and politics is merely the scape goat. I'd suggest really exploring what's causing it and addressing it that way, without hope in the system. You know, because the system kinda sucks and it's gonna be that way for most likely the rest of our lives. Life, however, doesn't have to suck forever though. I, for example, am struggling  even in spite living in cheap living conditions (god bless Las Vegas rent prices), but when I eventually graduate college with my computer science degree, I'll be a lot more comfortable as long I'm not like every other fucking moron that goes \"hey, I'm middle class now!

Read about the Roman Empire and the fall of it. Read about the Bronze Age collapse. See how humanity has evolved over the millennia.

Sure there were periods of intense hardship like the Dark Ages and the Black Death periods. But without those, we would not have the civilization we do today.\n* All in all, our quality of life has drastically improved. Our overall intelligence has risen. Our world is more peaceful now then in any other point in its history. The past is filled with wars and death and atrocities. Sure all of these can come back in one form or another, given the right circumstances.\n\nStart finding information about our incredible geological history and how the Earth has evolved in these BILLIONS of years. Read about the collision of Earth with a Mars-size planet that almost destroyed us and formed our Moon. Read about the Snowball Earths period. Read about the Siberian Traps and the Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event that wiped out 99% of all animal species on Earth. This information gave me the following perspectives:\n\n* Global warming and climate change are alarming and it will surely have a negative impact on our civilization. But the planet on a whole has been through a lot worse, from runaway greenhouse periods to runaway icehouse periods. The Earth and life will endure and I assume that with another 20-50 years worth of technological innovation, humanity will find a way to survive as well. This not a justification to keep pumping out greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. But it is my answer to all of the fear mongering, defeatists out there. \n* Catastrophes are undoubtedly bad for the populations that experience it. But for life as a whole, they just represent a new  opportunity. Without the events I mentioned above (and other of their kind) we would not be here.\n\nRead about technological innovations that are happening every year. You can find on Wikipedia a list of yearly scientific breakthroughs large and small. Read that. It will make you feel better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll of the above information helps me counterbalance the depressing nature of news of political happenings, the fall of liberalism and globalism, the rise of authoritarianism and nationalism.

            "Honestly try to get news as raw as you can. The more unbiased and focused a source is on simply reporting what happened and drawing your own conclusion is best. If you watch Fox you might hear about the god emperor's newest amazing diplomatic feat or how libtards are trying to eat babies. If you watch CNN (or even most other cable news sources honestly) you'll likely hear about blumpf's newest war that hes definitely gonna start this time. It's not all bad but anywhere that pursues a Trump bump is just gonna be toxic. Some others suggested simply looking at other countries news sources, that's not a bad idea they have less motivation to twist the story (usually). Other potential alternatives to purely neutral sources (which are kind of hard to find) are to seek out libertarian sources. The reason I suggest them is, while they tend to lean more right than left they still are very far on the political compass from mainstream news sources, so you at least get a unique perspective there that usually still don't really like either political party very much.\n\nAlso honestly life is a lot better than it may seem, don't get apathetic, but I think developing the ability to tune out some of the doomsaying is important.

Most of us have never been to Bangladesh (or insert x country) or the moon, but we have general notions of what existence is like or people are like in those places. It is virtually impossible to experience all placets, situations, things, so we use media to fill gaps (Neil Degrass Tyson tells us the universe is like this or that, sports casters call games we can't attend, Twitch streamers play games we can't buy, YouTube shows us cats licking their butt in Alaska, etc...). Some information comes interpersonally (talking to grandma), but most of their information is media-based as well.\n\nHe believed mass media and democracy were incompatible because mass media relies on the use of stereotyping to convey messages, and to participate in democracy, you need to be an informed voter.

When expectations are set recognizing that what politicians do is more determined by what helps them get reelected than what is right, you're less likely to be disappointed because you're dealing with the reality of power, rather than how you'd like to expect those in power to behave. Doesn't mean it's right, simply means we're dealing with reality as a starting point for what we do about it.   Run to reality.

            "Politicians - ignoring the craziness for a moment - have a hard job. They have to balance multiple needs and values.\n\n* What the country needs (trade, population growth management - more or less immigration to offset internal growth)\n\n* What the economy needs (jobs, profitable corporations)\n\n* What the people need (jobs, stable economy, education)\n\n* What the people want (less taxes, a climate action)\n\n* What the people actually want (Not to sacrifice their perceived quality of life)\n\nTrump, as well or poorly you think he's doing his job, has a hard job. A political leader cannot please everyone, but they need to please most people.\n\nThey truly believe that they're capable of doing well for the country, and they believe that they'll do better than the opposition. In order to do that, they need to get elected though.\n\nAs for the reason we seem to only get sociopaths and narcissists for leaders? You - a normal, empathetic person - feel overwhelmed by the stress, and you don't have a nearly the same level of responsibility and accountability for the problem. The politician on the other hand needs to be someone who can handle the responsibility and scrutiny of their nation and the world. Unfortunately the best way to manage that is with narcissism. \n\nBut take a step back from all that. The best you can really do is vote right? \n\nWrong.\n\nSo how do we do more? How do we get involved without feeling completely overwhelmed? The same way people deal with stress in their day to day lives. This is just a bigger scale.\n\nFocus on small pieces of the problems *you can solve*, and break them into tangible steps for *you* to do.\n\nRight now, I feel like the big hopeless issue hanging over my head is climate change and how we're going to fight it.\n\nI wont be passing any major bills to combat CO2 emissions by myself, or regulating oil companies to polite less. But there *are* steps that I can take to reduce my own carbon footprint.\n\nFor one, something as simple as planning my trips each day. I want to get groceries. So today I packed reusable bags in my car so I could get them on the way home from work. That means I save a few miles of driving, and eliminated the need to use a few extra plastic bags. A small victory, but it *also saved me some money and time*.\n\nAnother thing I do is try to reduce meat in my diet. Not a vegetarian diet by any means, but I try to supplement my meals with more beans and vegetables, and some carbs. A single chicken breast is now split over two meals rather than one. \n\nIt fills me up just the same if not more, but it's a lot cheaper than meat, healthier, and it's a lot more efficient when it comes to water and energy. The important part to me is the cost.\n\nWe all have this perception that fighting climate change will be expensive and it will cost us. Very often, the small \"green\" decisions we can make each day are *cheaper* and healthier than the alternative. It's just not always convenient.\n\nBiking to work one day a week is greener, cheaper, and healthier for you. It's a lot less convenient though.\n\nBringing this back to politics, leaders make decisions based on (economic) demand. If the data says that the demand is for oil, plastic, and meat, then thats the platform they push.\n\nThe economy as a whole follows the same trends. If people want oil and meat, the corporations will provide oil and meat.\n\nIn order to change the economy, we need to change the demand, and that happens in every household. Don't wait for someone to force you to change, start yourself. Tell your friends and family and help them make small changes too.\n\nThat's the whole point of things like \"carbon taxes\". It's an attempt to incite small changes in demand among the population, knowing that as demand changes so will the supply. The capitalist economy is a powerful force that will resist, but ultimately follow demand.",

Figure out what's important to you, dedicate some time a day to scroll through articles but dont spend all day reading and absorbing.

Did they do something you support? Write them and let them know. This can be frustrating depending where you live (I'm on the left living in OK) but there is something rewarding at least letting your reps know you're paying attention and what you expect.\n\n3.

            "**\u2022 Know the difference between news and entertainment.** One of the biggest problems in our modern media, is that they have blurred the line between what is information sharing and what is entertainment to get you hooked in to their broadcast. You know how scammers make you believe that your bank is trying to contact you by mimicking their style and appearance? That's what many \"news\" channels do, when in fact they are not news at all. There are a number of sources for real news that aren't intended to be entertainment. Discovering which ones are which is an important learning process we have to go through in order to process the stories we hear in a way that doesn't make us completely depleted. For example: 5 stories in a row from an entertainment \"news\" source will often pull on every emotional string it can, and not have any real valuable information. Whereas a real news source will answer your questions, do in depth analysis, and offer a way to look at it that's not pulling at your emotions. We can see 5 stories in a row that are like that, because we walk away informed, not distracted by our brains trying to deal with the emotion appeal. Yes, we need to be angry a little so we'll act. But emotion without logic is derailing. \n\n**\u2022 Know the difference between bias and propaganda.** Bias is looking at something through a certain lens or with a particular interest. Propaganda is an attempt to manipulate the viewer into believing things without their consent, while it looks like they are consenting. Propaganda is a way to manipulate a lot of people at the same time. Bias and manipulation can co-exist, but they are different. Bias is good faith, propaganda is bad faith. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad\\_faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_faith) When we know the difference between bias and propaganda, we can easily ignore the manipulative sources (even if they pull at what we already believe), and we can focus on the sources that might be biased, but they are trying to share info in good faith. \n\n**\u2022 Ask a lot of questions.** Don't take things at face value. The ability to ask questions gives us the freedom to wait a bit before becoming emotionally invested. When we can ask questions about what we just heard, we put a pin in it until those questions are answered. Sometimes, this can be used as an avoidance technique - \"What about how that affects XYZ? I don't know, so I'm going to ignore it because that question isn't knowable.\" But most of the time, if we are asking questions in good faith, because we honestly want to know more about what's going on before we make a decision on our emotions around that thing, we will eventually get our questions answered. In that process, we will have a handle on what's going on, and whatever emotions we have, will be more manageable as we feel we have more control over the situation. \n\n**\u2022 Read about history.** The world is a messed up place. It's also a beautiful place. Whatever we're going through now, we've been through a lot worse. Use those stories of overcoming hardship, of getting through tough times, and dealing with really really bad people in real life (not movies), and how that works, to understand that we will get through this too. It may take a while, and it might be painful, but life is low, then high, then low, then high. Life is like that. It's not what happens in the world, it's how we deal with it that determines our sanity. There will always be hardships. Always. How can you get mentally strong? By having perspective, experience, and understanding. And BTW, history is not all about kings and queens and politics. Read about any history at all - history of sports, of computers, of video games, of art, of fashion - anything. It is all tied together. And history of things you already like is much more engaging and a better place to springboard from to understand the bigger idea that life is up and down all the time. \n\n**\u2022 Get out and live life.** LIVE IT. Don't try to avoid pain or avoid scary things. Choose something challenging, something different, some new, and go try it. Go out and experience life. Be in nature, meet new people, visit a new city, try a new hobby, go to a play, listen to a concert, walk along the river, paint rocks. The more you live life, the more you will appreciate it. And the more you appreciate it, the more you'll realize that all the news is doing is trying to get you to stop looking at your life and look at it, so it can get viewers. If you have a full, robust, interesting life, where things matter to you, the news will not have as much space in your brain even if you are paying attention to what's going on out there. Add this to having a better way to process news, and it will have even less space in your brain. \n\n**\u2022 Get world information in small bits.** Honestly, it's not that important that you know what's going on in the world. If you are trying to be an informed citizen, and that information is making you confused and panicky, that's not being informed - that's being overwhelmed. The world would rather have you calm and focussing on making your personal life better than being \"informed\" and causing chaos in your life (and probably other's lives). The value of being an informed citizen is far far less than the value of you being a whole, capable person in society. Don't let anyone make you feel bad about not knowing everything that's happening in the world. Sometimes, we have to focus inward to get our shit together. And it's vitally important that we have our own shit together before we start looking outwards. \n\n**\u2022 Do something local.** All politics is local. The people who are (effectively) working on large scale problems all started local. Work on a community garden, go to local town halls, watch city council meetings, go to community info sessions, get involved locally. Make a change on your block, in your neighborhood, in your city. Each little improvement you make there, the more it adds up to the bigger picture. It's where you personally have influence, and it's where you can make the biggest impact. You cannot do anything to change what's going on nationally (except for vote), but you can change your community. Start there, and when you see things happen in the world, you'll know you're making a difference where you can, and you're part of the solution.",

            "I feel like all the answers you got so far are about \"why don't women's jeans *usually* have big pockets\" instead of answering your actual question of why it seems that every woman on the internet agrees that jeans *should* have bigger pockets but no one capitalizes on that. \n\nWhen you google \"womens jeans with deep pockets\", you actually do find a few brands that try this. [Radian Jeans](https://radianjeans.com/pages/about-us) is the first that popped up in my search. \n\nAs for \"oh well why isn't everyone just buying those then\", I'd speculate that lots of women struggle to find jeans that really suit them anyway, even without taking pocket size into account. Therefore ordering jeans online from a brand you've never heard of simply because they have pockets might be too big of a risk to just end up with ill-fitting jeans. That was my thought at least, though admittedly I *am* intrigued to try it.",
            "Fashion.\n\nIn general, women's clothing is made of lighter (and cheaper) material, meant to stretch and accentuate the body's shape. Consequently, it's difficult to maintain that shape when you have stuff in the pockets.\n\nSame with dress pockets. The skirt doesn't hang right when I have my phone in my dress pocket. In the past there would be slots in the skirt and women would wear a special pocket belt underneath. \n\nI've occasionally bought men's jeans, but the proportions aren't right on me. I've considered hiking/cargo pants though, the ones I've seen are a light and durable material with large pockets.",
            "I\u2019ve been wondering this too. A couple of entrepreneurial women could really sell some sweet jeans if they not only added pockets as big as men\u2019s jeans pockets but also made them available in several shapes and sizes.",
            "I agree with the others about the whole trendy thin fabric sort of trend.\n\nBut they also do this to women's sweat pants folks, tiny. Pockets. In sweatpants. Come on.\n\nI only buy men's sweat pants now and it's great! I can fit an entire pickle jar in one of the pockets! Magic :)",

            "My jeans have pockets but the problem is they are usually so shallow in comparison to make jean pockets. Like they are only 4 inches deep and can\u2019t fit much.",
            "Deeper pockets on womens clothes would mean they're not as form fitting. \n\nBeyond that, there are women's jeans and dresses with \"regular\" pockets but they don't sale as well because..... They're not as form fitting",
            "The main issue is that for a lot of women, the usual places you'd put pockets are on the widest parts of our bodies. I've come across bottoms with pockets, but any such pant or skirt that I've tried on just made me look wider in the hips (and I really don't need that). On top of the actual garment making me look wider, I'd also put stuff in those pockets and look like i have chipmunk pants. I imagine that this makes women's clothes with pockets just sell less than items which are more flush to the body.",
            "tbh I just shop in the little boys section because I'm short enough. They're form fitting (but not TOO form fitting which is what I like), and they have bigger pockets",
            "Truth: Often people say they want X, but don't actually want X.\n\nEveryone complains about airlines, but when they go to book a flight, they always book the cheapest flight. That's why service sucks and everything keeps getting worse and smaller. Because that's what people actually want.\n\nWomen insist they want pockets. But we already have companies they make jeans with pockets. They aren't very popular. \n\nForget what people say they want. Look at what actions they take. Women are smart, capable, independent people. If I can find women's jeans with big pockets online in 30 second, so could they.\n\nClearly, they prioritize other aspects more than the pockets.",
            "Form over function. A small number of women might choose the jeans because of their superior pockets but generally most will just choose the jeans that look the best.\n\nClothes manufacturers want to maximise profits, making jeans without pockets is cheaper but they can sell them for the same price and they will most likely sell better as well. It's a win win for them.",
            "The answer is pretty simple actually. What people say they want and what they actually buy are often two different things. Cost, style, fit, form, function all factor quite differently at time of sale vs expressing opinions in poles, interviews, or friends. \n\nExample: we once surveyed people about how much more they pay for \u201cMade in USA\u201d. At 20% premium, around 80% said they\u2019d pay the premium. When we offered two identical shirts in our test store, the lower priced non-US made shirt outsold the other 5 to 1.",

            "Don\u2019t know where other women buy their jeans, but most of mines have pockets\u2026 am I super lucky??",
            "They do. There are a number of brands that are literally built on the idea of being women's jeans with actual pockets. \n\nBut it's become a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy - we *want* pockets, but it's not like we *expect* pockets, so if we want into an American Eagle store and try on a pair of jeans that don't have pockets, it's not likely to prevent a sale, because it's just a problem we've come to accept as a fact of life. And if that's true, why would AE spend the money on adding pockets to their jeans when they know that we'd probably still buy them without?",
            "Because women want more than one thing and in this case two of them contradict each other.\n\nMost want pockets.\n\nMost also want form fitting, smooth looking garments with no ugly bulges.\n\nPockets create bulges.\n\nAs it turns out, while women want both things, most will choose style over pockets.  As a result, pockets just don't sell very well.  \n\n\nGuys on the other hand are more likely to make the opposite choice, even if we often have want the same two things.  We are most willing to sacrifice a small amount of style to get more utility.  \n\n\nOf course these are generalizations and you can easily find the opposite sort of person in each group, but it's the vast majority that drive sales, not the rarer exceptions.",
            "Because men's pants exist. Once you make pants with reasonable pockets, a more relaxed fit, and higher durability you have mens pants. Great example is my wife and I have often mixed up each other's coveralls in the dark in the early morning (we run a farm) because there is no difference whatsoever between them other than color (no hers aren't pink). For the most part practical utilitarian clothing has very little difference from men to women especially if it's a looser fitting garment. But as others have alluded to if you want form fitting, and not just women there are pieces of men's clothing this way as well, all that practical consideration goes right out the window. If you want utility clothing get ready to look pretty amorphous in it.",
            "You don't have to mass-produce women. There's plenty of 'em.",
            "Pockets are not flattering.  Big pockets have no reason to be big unless they're going to be full of something and full pockets ruin the visual effect of a set of form fitting garments.  \n\nWomen who are not too concerned with the visual effect of utilized pockets typically already DO buy pants with normal pockets... they mosey over to the Men's section and buy regular old pants.  \n\nAny company wanting to appeal to the \"women who want big pockets\" market has to beat out what ALL the other pants makers haven't figure out how to beat out:  How to keep women who WANT good pockets from just wearing men's pants?  \n\nThere are specialty pants companies for women that are very practical, but they tend to be expensive, relative to grabbing off the shelf menswear.  \n\nYou can check out (Google, I suppose) \"Red Ants Pants\" to see some practical pants intended for women.    They're great!   But they're not cheap and they're not what the vast majority of women are looking for in pants.",
            "Jeans have pockets. I guess it's because most women prefer skinny jeans than the bulgy ones.",

            "You can't have big pockets with tight jeans. Women have to choose, pocket size, or tight pants. It's not that they don't exist, there are options out there, women just don't buy them. \n\n( I am a women with baggy pants, some are men's). -You can fit a whole damn Nintendo switch in my pockets.",
            "Because those same women want skin tight jeans that don't have a bunch of lumps or wrinkles in them. They want them to fit a very specific way AND have big pockets.",
            "Because on balance, they perhaps don't. People might lament the lack of functionality that comes without usable pockets, but the cut of jeans changes massively when pockets are added, and especially if you use pockets. Women usually wear jeans fairly tight, and often like stretch jeans. If you carry stuff in your pockets it changes the look quite a lot. Women are generally a bit more conscious of that kind of stuff. Many of them carry bags so as not to have these problems.",
            "Because what people say they want and what they really want is too different things, if they want bigger pockets then they need to accept bigger baggier jeans that don't fit as tightly, and you notice woman  tend to wear jeans very form fitting not loose baggy ones.\n\nBasically they are all talk and no trousers",
            "Company: we got great jeans with pockets! \n\nWomen on day1: yay! Let\u2019s buy a pair. Woo! \n\nWomen on day 2: well , actually they kind of suck, the shape goes out after you put so many things. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m not carrying my bag anyways, it makes me look fat, yada yada yada.",
            "Women's clothing for plus size, hiking, and farming have some good pockets. This is because these clothes are not seen as \"sexy\". You are simply not allowed to be sexy with pockets because the pockets hide the shape of the body in the areas they are installed. \n\nI suspect it's the fashion designers issue more than what women actually prefer since clearly a thin woman isn't going to buy plus size just to get pockets and likewise won't choose coveralls or hiking pants Just for the pockets. If none of the standard options have pockets you can't conclude women prefer pants without pockets. Fashion designers decided women can't be sexy with pocket bulges, so we have no pant options with them. There won't be any added pocket options until somehow pockets get labeled as sexy by a current style.",
            "Gloria Vanderbilt.",
            "Because you're conflating \"want the utility of pockets\" with \"willing to wear pockets\".\n\nThere's an abundance of women's clothing available with perfectly functional pockets, and there are plenty of women who happily wear such clothes regularly.  The ones complaining about a lack of pockets are *really* complaining that pockets aren't \"cute\" enough to go with their \"outfit\".\n \nSo the short answer is simply *vanity*, not some sort of conspiracy by clothing manufacturers to keep women pocketless.",
            "Plenty do. The pocket problem isn't that common for jeans in my experience",
            "All my jeans have pockets...",
            "They\u2019ve tried and they don\u2019t sell well.  Because the truth is following the beauty standard is more important. Once they have usable pockets they look like men\u2019s jeans and are no longer form fitting.",

            "Because it\u2019s not actually what women want.. if they did.. the demand would be there and supply would catch up.",
            "They've been made, the problem is fashion/aesthetic tastes.  \n\nYou want tight hip hugging jeans that display your womanly figure?  Yeah you arn't using those pockets for anything more than a microgram of lint if that.  If you use them to hold almost anything at all everyone in the world will see it and they would in general be uncomfortable too.  \n\nIf you really want jeans with pockets as a woman just go buy mens or boys sizes that fit you and move on with life.  If you stick to womens jeans you are accepting fit and fashion over utility and as a result will not have nicer pockets.  \n\nThe reality is most women asking for pockets on jeans.  Want sexy fashionable jeans, but they also want them to be comfortable, AND also somehow maintain all of that while letting them have good pockets/storage.  At some point design needs to give and/or fashion trends have to change.",

            "most womens jeans do have pockets, they're just shallow. I guess some don't.\n\nbut here's the secret - women would put on pants, put some stuff in their pockets, realize it ruins the way their figure looks, and then never do it again.\n\na guy wearing not-skin-tight pants with pockets doesn't look much different if he stuffs his pockets. but women's pants are usually skin-tight and meant to accentuate her figure. stuffed pockets would mess with that.",
            "You just need to look at reddit posts and comments to get the answer.\n\nSomeone posts a picture of something they made, whether it be a game, art piece, woodworked thing, or other product. A thousand people say \"shut up and take my money!!!\" and express significant excitement about how much they want it and would love to buy one. Fast forward a little while, and nobody gave anyone their money.\n\nIn other words, tons of women complain about not having pockets, and say how much they would like to have pockets. But the experience from companies that do in fact offer pockets, or the fact that women could just buy men's pants and wear those (especially since the skinny jeans revolution, men's pants can still be reasonably tight and flattering), but nobody* actually buys them, goes a long way to reveal where the priorities actually lie.\n\nIf I was a woman I think the main reason why even if I had pockets I wouldn't use them much is because almost all women's clothes don't have sufficient pocket space, so 99% of the time I would adapt and make do with alternate solutions like purses or bags, and transitioning to and from that bag-based solution to a pocket-based solution on an outfit by outfit basis would be obnoxious.",

            "Because the notion that the market will always adapt to the needs and desires of the consumer is flawed at best. Companies will always try to sell a product at a sweet spot that maximises revenue at the lowest cost possible. Even a potential boost to revenue will be overlooked if the deem the cost:benefit ratio to be too skewed out of their favour.\n\nDisruption (such as offering jeans with pockets) is more likely to come from smaller businesses looking to gain a foothold in the market by addressing a need. Being a smaller company, the price will by necessity increase compared to if the bigger stores offered the same product - and if it increases too much, then the product will not take off.\n\nLaunching an entire new line of jeans (look at the big pockets!) would also require floor/shelf space in brick-and-mortar stores, which could hurt the sales of proven sellers - both by reducing the amount that sell, but also by potentially causing 'analysis paralysis'. If a customer needs a new pair of jeans, and likes the *look* of these jeans, but the *pockets* on those jeans, they may walk away with neither.\n\nThese are just reasons off the top of my head. But my first paragraph is 100% accurate. Companies exist to maximise their revenue, not to improve their product offering. The latter is usually a side-effect of the former - they improve their product if they think they can make more money by doing it. But they'll also make their product worse for the same reason - if reducing overheads by reducing quality won't harm sales or market share.",

That said, if someone doesn't fill it out, I just open the resume \u2014 and if I do like what I see there, I *still* open the resume anyway to read in more detail.

Whether it's connecting my phone to the car, or a laptop to a speaker, it rarely goes smoothly.  My tablet randomly connects to my surround sound because 3 months ago I used it and today it just felt like randomly connecting again for no good reason, like old friends maybe?

            "\"bluetooth is a simple concept\"\n\nBluetooth, as with most forms of communication, is not a simple concept. There are tons of steps with communication protocols to ensure connections can work at all, and also they are secure, they can't be snipped by other devices, and they support features like saved devices, or different usage scenarios.\n\nBluetooth is the most commonly adapted form of wireless communication from a close area. Wifi and cellular are designed to handle many devices over a large area, closer protocols like nfc and bluetooth are designed to transmit data directly between a source and destination. As some others have said here before, bluetooth has it's advantages, like less power and more compatibility, to other protocols. Imagine having to connect to a wifi ssd from your headphones, instead of pairing 2 devices with a direct bluetooth connection (sure wifi protected setup exists to let password less devices connect to wifi, but it's insecure, far less used, and even more difficult to use). Bluetooth has also improved over time (there's different bluetooth versions you can look at/google if interested), but bluetooth is backwards compatible as well, meaning new devices still have to support older and more problematic devices.\n\nWill something ever replace bluetooth? Maybe. Micro usb was the most common phone connection (after the connections got unified away from proprietary connections), until recently with usb c, which has had a very rapid adaptation into phones (and even computers). There could be a better communication protocol than bluetooth designed for close range communication, maybe even one that's cross compatible with bluetooth.\n\nIf you don't want something with complex protocols just to produce audio, there's always the 3.5mm headphone jack: just a straight and simple analog signal.

            "Wifi and bluetooth are two different technologies created for different purposes. Wifi is for networking, so range, transfer speed, network capacity and error prevention are prioritized over power efficiency. Bluetooth is designed to be used in small devices over short distances so it doesn't need powerful antennae multi-host networking etc but it does need to be power efficient and fucking hell it is. You can have BLE beacons running off a single battery for ages, small headphones last 10-20+ hours of continuous playback without draining your phone's battery as well. If we used wifi for headphones they'd be dead within 2 hours or heavy AF to accommodate bigger bateries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>it takes three restarts and 5 minutes of finnicky shit to just switch my 400 dollar bluetooth headphones from one device to another one\n\nI learned the hard way that expensive, high-quality audio devices are usually utter shit when it comes to bluetooth connectivity.

The main source of complexity is that a BT device can be anything - therefore the devices must \"negotiate\" the connection - that includes the authorization, exchange of capabilities, and more. Some devices can be hosts for some connections, and clients for others (e.g., a car is a sound device to your phone, while your phone is a directory device to your car). Device switching is particularly tricky, since you don't want a headset bouncing around hosts without your permission/consent - so the devices must negotiate when to connect and when to release a connection in favor of another. \n\nWiFi has a fixed function (networking), fixed roles (router is the host, device is the client). The hosts don't care whether a device switches networks - it's all a client decision. The host is never concerned about saving power. It's just a much simpler protocol.",

A sedan is cheaper, more fuel efficient, and meets the needs of a lot of people.\n\nBluetooth likewise is great for moving small packets of information using very little energy. You can run bluetooth communication using a watch battery for more than a year in certain settings. A wifi router (which is literally microwaving you're entire house) requires as much as 60 watts where a BLE radio can run on as little as 0.01 watts. BLE devices also don't interfere with each other. My office probably has 60 bluetooth devices in it right now, but if we had even 3 wifi routers, there would be dead-zones everywhere.",

Yet I can leave the room and leave the iPhone behind and the headphones don't lose the signal.\n\nBluetooth is a very low-powered protocol (by design) and if there is a lot of interference (by wifi or other electromagnetic radiation), Bluetooth suffers even over short distances.

I can mute the audio when I set the volume to 0, but otherwise the volume remains unchanged.

            "Bluetooth was never designed to replace Wi-Fi or be better than it. It was basically invented for the very use that it currently serves. Short range connections that run on a different frequency than Wi-Fi. For what it's designed for, it does its job beautifully. \n\nIf we had, for example, wireless earbuds using Wi-Fi, they would drain their batteries extremely quickly. And it could (in some circumstances) get hot as well.\n\nAs far as your headphone story goes, Bluetooth is often considered low priority by certain devices. So sometimes switching this to a lower priority signal requires manual interaction. Think of how many wireless connections are buzzing around your home at ANY given moment. You wouldn't want your devices to randomly pick up and start using a lesser connection. Manual interfaces help alleviate that problem because now the user can specify what signal to use.\n\nAnd lastly, think of how big your Wi-Fi router is at home. Your phone would be MASSIVE. Imagine trying to walk through the city streets on a Friday night, Wi-Fi headphones cranked up, scrolling through a phone that looks like a literal brick.",
            "Here is a decent over simplified article on the issue: https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/understanding-bluetooth-pairing-problems/\n\nWhat they don't go into here is interference. BT runs on the 2.4Ghz spectrum, same as wifi (well the older standard). In an office / apartment scenario the spectrum tends to be VERY crowded. Protocols are pretty good at handling the congestion and do a lot of fun software / hardware mitigations to make the congestion unnoticeable, when you start mixing the different protocols they don't always know how to properly deal with each other and cause issues.\n\nAt a job a few years ago we had cubicles, everyone using macbook pro's and started finding all sort of fun issues. It was about 50 ppl in a normal cubicle farm (not handling phone calls, so extra packed in). Wifi would cut in and out, keyboards and mice would stop working, so on and so forth. Took out some diagnostic equipment and found that those 50 people had close to 500 different active BT devices (computers, keyboards, mice, head phones, work phone, personal phone, ear buds, so on and so forth). Now all that plus the wifi (of course there was no ethernet, straight wifi only) was congested... but that wasn't the culprit. It was the new bulbs they got for the overhead lights. The lights were on a dimmer and this particular model of bulb would basically throw out so much interference when the the dimmer was over 30% power it would cause the devices to lose connection. First time I was ever able to close a support ticket with the computer issues are actually caused by building maintenance (as opposed to all the tickets we would get in saying that their light bulb needed replaced or whatever because you know, if it accepts power it must be IT's job to fix it).",
