I think it\u2019s extremely immature and shows that you don\u2019t truly love who you\u2019re marrying and it made me really sad to hear. Either way i don\u2019t think it makes a difference for how i feel about it, but is this common? I know strippers are very common at bachelor parties although i don\u2019t agree with that concept either. But having sex with multiple women right before you get married is way over the line imo. Thoughts?",

            "We just played smash bros and got wasted at my bachelor party, shit was lit",
            "Yeah that's super lame. I feel sad for your mom. I would never cheat on my wife, not when we were engaged or dating before that. Very not cool.",
            "So he cheated on his fiance? That's mega asshole behavior.",
            "The idea of the bachelor party being \"one last night of freedom\" is an old trope that some people use(d) as an excuse.  The reality is banging someone else is cheating on your girlfriend regardless of if a wedding is planned so it's not like you were free before.  Most people know this and don't cheat, but some selfish people (man or woman) use it as an excuse to act out.  \n\nA guy named Drex has shared on podcasts stories of women who look to get a bull, a train/gang bang, or other sexual service as a \"last hurrah\" before marriage.  A story in particular on Bill Burr's podcast tells of a guy whose laaady banged the bartender of the bachelorette party in the bed they were to be newly weds in the next night.  Dude found out ten years later after they ran into the bartender and the laaady acted weird (and tried to deny it at first).\n\nSome people are just selfish, and I choose to believe most people recognize this as shitty behavior.",
            "I wouldn't even say strippers a very common, it's usually just a rowdy night out getting drunk and having a friendly laugh at the bachelors expense.  \nOne I went to even had the best man have us sign a piece of paper (just symbolic, it was only a piece of paper) that we wouldn't let the groom do anything he would regret on his wedding day, if you know what I mean.  \nSome people are just shitty people and I think they're just looking for a reason to cheat, and claiming it's \"traditional\" during a bachelor party is just their way to excuse it.  those people usually find other reasons too, like maybe new years, and their birthday, or when they are travelling etc.  \nYou can't trust those people in my opinion.",

            "For mine we rented a lake house and just drank, hung out, cooked great food and did dumb shit. I just wanted a weekend with the guys and it was awesome. \n\nThere are certainly people who want something more exciting than what I asked for. I don't think cheating on your fianc\u00e9 is \"normal\" but there are some couples where those boundaries are a little more flexible.",
            "I know a few women who did the same on their hen parties. People can be shit! Chances are these people banged a few others behind their SOs back before/after as well.",
            "Sounds like a \u201cI just need to get it out of my system\u201d kind of thing.\n\nSpoiler - it doesn\u2019t work its way out.",
            "The best one I ever went to was beer, golf, then more beer followed during a late game of poker. No women of any kind.",
            "No, it's not.\n\nBachelor party is to get together with your friends and have a good time doing things the bachelor enjoys. That shouldn't involve the bachelor cheating on their SO. If that's their idea of fun, probably shouldn't do the whole marriage thing unless it's an open relationship kind of deal.\n\nAlso on the strippers thing, I've been to about 11-12 bachelor parties including my own and only two involved strippers. One involved strippers because a couple of the guys wanted them, but the groom and most people didn't care all that much for it. Another was because we were in New Orleans where one of the streets has a ton so we figured we would check it out once. All others I've been, we basically all just hung out with each other, played games, did some kind of activity like paintball and just got drunk hanging out. Maybe it's my friends, but think the stripper thing gets overplayed a bit.",

            "As a former Vegas casino host for over a decade, I assure you it\u2019s extremely common, at least in the US. But I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s \u201cnormal\u201d and definitely not healthy.",
            "Cheating on your fiance, not normal.\n\nTelling your kid how their dad fucked three women at a bachelor party, also not normal.",
            "That is called cheating.",
            "Not normal. It depends on who you get with. \n\nGood people don't do that. Infact some people don't even have rippers at their bachelor party. Just good times with their friends.",
            "Depends on what you mean by \"common\".  Common enough that it's a bit of a cliche story, one you might see in a movie?  Yes.  Common enough that any reasonable person finds it remotely acceptable?  No.",
            "The last bachelor party I went to we played D&D and got hammered it was a blast. No one fucked anyone.",
            "It's not normal. When a friend of mine had his bachelor party we went canoeing. Another I heard about had a LOTR themed treasure hunt.\n\nI think the whole strippers and cheating during your bachelor party comes from a time where people felt obligated to get married in a timely manner, so many didn't wait to find the right partner. They just settled for anyone and knowing they didn't love their fiancee and wouldn't enjoy their marriage, they enjoyed themselves on their \"last day of freedom\". One's spouse used to be referred to as \"the old ball and chain\" in that generation too.",
            "Unfortunately I used to work as a barmaid in a strip club and heard a lot of people brag about how they had a prostitute lined up for the stag later. Like it was not uncommon.\n\nGo to a strip club, get the stag horney and drunk then throw him at a prostitute at the end of the night. Even plotting to do it so the brides family WHO ARE ON THE STAG DO don't know what's happening.\n\nThe worst one for me is the stag who shagged the girl next to him on the plane to Ibiza while his pregnant fianc\u00e9 was at home. Watching all his friends high fiving etc made me feel sick and so sad for his (now ex) fianc\u00e9. \n\nWhat makes it easier is for some women being the 'last shag for a stag' is a turn on and it's like a sense of pride for the stag to have one last one before the being tied down.\n\nJust the whole thing is stupid.",
            "I didn't have a bachelor party but if I didn't, I certainly wouldn't have cheated on my fiancee. Cause that's what that is. It's cheating.",
            "It happens, but they don\u2019t need to try fool themselves. It wasn\u2019t \u201cjust tradition,\u201d and they didn\u2019t get \u201ccaught up in the moment.\u201d \n\nYou didn\u2019t just cheat on your girlfriend. You cheated on your fianc\u00e9. And as close as it is to the big day, I consider it cheating on your wife, the woman who will probably be the mother of your children one day. \n\nThose garbage human being-level behavior.",

            "As a waiter I have worked bachelor and bachelorette parties and oddly enough I have seen more 'cheating' behaviour and strippers at bachelorette parties by far. So yes I think it is actually fairly common but I don't think it's gender neutral. I would say it's more who you're friends with/what the group thinks is acceptable. Like my friends would all call me out if I banged a girl the night before marriage. That's fucked.",
            "This is common but it's not because of the bachelor party, it's because he is a cheater. \n\nSource: We ended up at a strip club during my bachelor party, my grooms men kept me in the vip room the entire time. I made it through without banging a bunch of stripers.",
            "Some strippers perhaps. Some lap dances maybe. Banging three sex workers at your bachelor party, is usually frowned upon, not to mention very expensive",
            "No. Sure, some people will do it, but it is absolutely not normal (or accepted by most people). For my buddy's bachelor party, we just went to a friend's place, had pizza, drinks, and played poker. In fairness, I would say it was tamer than normal, but actually cheating during the party is not",
            "In \"the old days\" it was supposedly normal, though not at all common, and might still exist today but is even less common. It's a subculture ideal - certain people think it's a right of passage, for before a virgin has one partner for life or sucks at sex the first time - but no, most people don't do that.",

            "Male on second marriage and been to NUMEROUS bachelor parties, multiple included strip clubs including my first marriage bachelor party.\n\nNormal average experience for me:\nStrippers and lap dances. \nLots of shit talking about what youd like to be doing with the strippers. \nToo much alcohol, getting sick.\n\nSeen some borderline/inappropriate touching and one situation where two women came and hung out with our group one of which attempted to sleep with the groom. He seemed to consider (I think because Of the peer pressure) ultimately passed on it.\n\nNEVER at any of these bachelor parties did the groom actually have sexual relations with another women. \n\nHaving sex with at least THREE WOMEN is oddly impressive but also fucking gross for a guy about to get married.\n\nImagine a bride getting a train ran on her at the bachelorette party\n\nHorribly selfish, gross behavior.",

            "Not normal at all. Most bachelor parties are pretty tame nowadays; that's all from a bunch of age groups all over the country. The whole go super crazy at your bachelor party seems like a myth mostly perpetuated by the media.",
            "So, I\u2019m a woman who met my husband 21 years ago, married 16. This is how it should go if there\u2019s a stripper. Any other female entertainment (further sex work) is a very bad idea and if provided, the best man should be sacked immediately. \n\nMy beloved likes large ladies\u2014and I mean 3-6x, not 1x. I\u2019m in his range so do not feel threatened. His best man found a quite fluffy stripper on Craigslist and rented out a neighborhood bar. She performed, the dudes drank. Then he came home to me super excited to tell me that his way shy best friend had arranged this. \n\nThat\u2019s what partnership looks like. You want to share, not hide. \n\nIn my experience, most folks have moved on from the whole \u2018ball and chain\u2019 concept and have embraced partnership. \n\nIf you can\u2019t enjoy, vicariously, your intended\u2019s night? That is not the person for you.",

            "Tf?\n\nBut since everyone is sharing their bachelor party stories:\n\nSo I'm brand new in the army, still in training. I use a 4-day weekend to fly home, without leave, from Florida to Arizona. My flight gets cancelled, so I stay a night longer in Florida before finally flying out. Flight I do catch gets turned around once from Dallas because of a storm, sent to college town to refuel. Second attempt, turned around again from Dallas because of the same storm, sent to baton rouge. Third times a charm and I make it. Obv missed my connecting flight to Phoenix AZ. Get the next available flight, but only to Tucson, 2 hours south of Phoenix. Send it.\n\nSo I arrive in Tucson at about midnight, get picked up and brought 2 hours north to Phoenix, to then start my bachelor party at 2 am. On. My. Wedding. Day.\n\nSo we (older bro and close friends) drank at a crowded club, went back to our hotel, talked and BS-ed a ton, I brought MREs (military rations) and we ate that gobshite and passed out. For about 5 hours and woke to get ready for the wedding. It was great and worked out perfectly.\n\nSo long story short OP that's called cheating. Fuck-em.",
            "No. Not normal at all. A strip club or something? Sure. But that's hands off. Cheating on your fianc\u00e9e/partner? That's not cool under any circumstances.\n\nI've been to a number of bachelor parties and the most risque it ever got was a strip show. Anything beyond that would have invited serious questions from the friends of the couple.",

Yeah, no, far, far, far from the norm.\n\nStrippers are common, yes, as are strip *clubs* (I'm like you, I disagree with this stuff happening at bachelor parties as well - except of course if the bride-to-be is cool with it), but actually cheating on your fianc\u00e9e? No, that's not normal. So sorry you and your mum had to find out about this.",

            "Not normal at all.\n\nEven strippers are a bit much for bachelor parties these days.  Friends offered to take me to a strip club for my bachelor party.  I declined and we went skeet shooting and then to a piano bar.   Five years later another friend in that group got married.

            "While it seems completely crazy to my worldview  there are people who actually think \"It's not cheating if it's on my bachelor party\". As someone pointed out, they think it's their last chance of \"fun\" before marrying and being in a family with responsibilities.\n\nThere are many questions we may ask on that subject, such as:\n\n- If you think you'll never have fun again, or that marriage is a prison, why are you marrying in the first place? Isn't it possible to have fun with your spouse?\n\n- If you love and respect your partner, and truly believe in fidellity, why is this day any different than others? Why is any behavior excused in a bachelor party but not on other days? Do your values suddenly don't matter?\n\n- Is contact with strippers, drugs and prostitutes really the best way to start a marriage? What makes you think you will only desire those things once and never again think about it?\n\nOne of the reasons there are so many divorces is that people marry without knowing why, without the principles and commitments that hold a marriage together. They just do it because they like spending time with someone and think they'll be in love forever. \n\nI'm recently married and my bachelor party had my closest friends pulling pranks, playing games, eating, talking, laughing, making me eat hot pepper and playing table RPG (what a nerd, right?). It was amazingly fun!\n\nWe also prayed and thanked God for my marriage, and I thanked them for their friendship and their company throughout many years. It was a place of fun, friendship and celebration, but involved nothing I can't do again here in my house. I had fun with fun, I have fun every day with my wife, and I know there will be tough times, but I hope to get through it all at her side and with their support. To me, this is the way (mandatory mandalorian reference)",

I don't know what happened to them.  \n\nNeither of my bachelor parties (15 and 5 years ago) had strippers.  Was just guys playing video games and eating terrible food.  The most common activity I've done for a bachelor party(been to 6-10) is go to a baseball game\n\nSo I'd say that no it's not normal, but it does happen, or at least it happened 20+ years ago at that one bachelor party I went to.  None of my contemporary friends have had a bachelor party that would even been considered risque in such a fashion",
            "I've never been to a bachelor party, but I'm pretty sure that would be universally frowned upon.

He was the only person who wanted a stripper. \n\nMy husband says he's never been to a strip club and isn't interested.

            "I'm 41 years old here, so I'm going to have a way different slant than most people here on this. About 20 years ago, this was not only common it was a trope. You saw this on TV, and movies, it glamorized the hooker/stripper bachelor party idea. On top of that most 18-30 year old guys that got married 20 years ago, well we were all kinda stupid. Guys just mirrored their bachelor parties based on what they saw on TV or movies. That same group of shitty guys well now bachelor parties are golf weekends, going to the horse racing track, traveling.  \n  \nThe change is huge, one all the guys that use to do this shit were shamed and it totally crushed this whole idea. It was normal at one point but we are well past it. It is a product of boomer mentality on what a bachelor party should be, not what it is.  \n  \nBasically long story short it use to be normal, then our entire gender woke the hell up. Yeah there are still shitty people out here doing that stuff, but for the most part it is a tradition that is kinda dead now.  \n  \nYou see it in other industries as well, strip clubs are not nearly as popular as they were, and going to vegas with the boys does not happen nearly as much anymore. And if you do vegas it ain't like the 90s and 2000s anymore.",

A husband to be should be focused on having a good time with his friends to unwind the tension and stress that builds up leading to the wedding (originally the whole point of the bachelor party) as well as excited, maybe even nervous, for tomorrow thinking about his bride to be.\n\nIt should never be an excuse for \"one more night of freedom\" because if you already asked her to marry you, you already committed to her.

Some women though can't see the red flags for whatever reason. I'm not saying the guys out of these group are good or boyfriend material. I'm just saying all men know from a distance if a guy is that red flag.\n\n\nSame answer for when women ask if guys hang out with men who catcall. Most times we don't because these guys are also assholes to other dudes. It's red flags all along. Sure there are a few exceptions like being way too young, though that doesn't mean it's just a phase and they will likely grow up to be asses anyway. \n\n\n\nAnd it's not worth to be friend with those people because they never bring anything meaningful to the table other than asymmetrical teasing (like a bully), secondhand embarrassment, funnelling of conversation topics to the macho stereotype and other issues.",

I was about eight years old, and my uncle (who was one of those stereotypical wealthy, privileged wild guys) was marrying a woman who came from a very humble background and was very religious. How they ended up together, I have no idea, unless maybe she was marrying him for his money but I digress. It was the rehearsal dinner at this lavish hotel, and on the table in front of each plate was a tiny box that I was told not to open until someone told me it was time. All at once, the lights went out and the room was plunged into darkness. The adult beside me was whispering, open the box now! There\u2019s a mask inside! Put it on! So I did. And a few moments later, the lights came back on and everyone in the room other than the bride to be was staring at her in a pig mask. \u201cOh! I want one!\u201d She cried out joyfully, laughing, but her joy was to be short lived. My uncle was part of the volunteer fire department, and suddenly, in through the side door his fellow volunteers came rushing in, uniformed, also wearing pig masks, pushing a stretcher. They loaded my uncle on, and I\u2019ll never forget the smug, satisfied grin on his face as he folded his hands on his chest and they rushed him out. My would-be aunt was bewildered, hysterical, throwing a fit, asking everyone what on earth that was. No one would tell her. Come to find out, it was all a very elaborate plan my uncle and his friends orchestrated with everyone else and especially his buddies so that he could be spirited away to a high end strip club and eventually to a hotel with loads of prostitutes and drugs for his bachelor party. This was done at the last minute, the night before the wedding, because she\u2019d thrown a fit and refused to marry him if he had a bachelor party\u2026but with the wedding taking place the next day, she was less likely to call it off due to all the pressure on her. She threatened to call it off, but went through with it. It wasn\u2019t a very happy day, but she married him anyway. They are still together, oddly enough, but yeah. That happened.",

            "Instead of definitions, which are abstract and can be changed on a whim, I am going to answer this from an ethical perspective; is having sex in the manner you described ethically wrong in the manner that bestiality is wrong? \n\nThere are two primary reasons that the practice of bestiality is considered wrong/taboo. The first being the inability of the animal to provide meaningful consent to the sexual act, and the second being the possibility of producing a non-viable (or worse, viable) hybrid. \n\nFor the first issue, for the rat to be controlling the person, and assuming that it controlled the person enough that the person gave consent, then this is obviously a fantasy animal, with at least human levels of cognition, and thus, capability to consent. So the so you are not immoral for taking advantage of the animal. However, it is possible that the human host is not able to consent, depending on the nature of the control. If the person is being completely controlled against their will, then while you might not have ethically committed bestiality with the rat, you did rape the human, especially if you know that their actions are being controlled. \n\nThe second potential problem with bestiality, the possibility of creating a half-human hybrid is cut and dry. No, that is not a problem, since the parts of each of you that are copulating are purely human. ",

            "Possible answers:\n\n1.) You are touching the human while they are not in control of themselves. You are raping the human. The rat is analogous to drugs or alcohol. Since it's not legally a being capable of consent, you are either using the rat to rape them, or you don't realize the rat is there, and this is a tragic misunderstanding. (IANAL I have no idea how the law applies if the person gives explicit and unambiguous enthusiastic consent, but then it later turns out they were definitely out of their mind). In this case, since you're not touching the rat, it's no more participating In the sex than a dog that jumps up on the bed is.\n\n---\n\nHowever, if the rat *is* legally recognized as a sentient being, there'd have to be a distinct category for \"inter species sex between sentient beings\" since AFAIK Bestiality is specifically a crime because animals are not capable of consent, so if the rat *can* unambiguously  consent, it wouldn't qualify\n\nIf this is true, possibilities include:\n\n---\n\n2.) You and the rat are both violating the human's autonomy. You are both conspiring to rape the human.\n\n3.) You believe you are sleeping with a consenting human adult. The rat is raping you both by deception and coercion respectively.\n\n4.) The human fully consents to the sex, you all know what's going, and this is basically some sort of kinky bondage thing. \n - if the other human is unable to give a safe word, or withdraw consent at any point, then it's very dangerous, but as long as they don't actually end up trying to use the safe word it's just dangerous and unhealthy, but AFAIK, not technically illegal.\n - if, however, the human is able to use a safe word(IDK, maybe the rat Isn't controlling their mouth), then it would be just a kinky threesome, which is perfectly legal.",

Not to severely dampen the mood, but you could compare it to sex slavery in the porn industry, where someone (the rat) is coercing someone (the person wearing the hat) to have sex with someone else (the third person). In real life, this coercion might come from verbal directions rather than pulling hairs in a hat, but ultimately the position and role of the rat and the porn producer is the same\u2014they both dictate the actions of someone as that person has sex with another person, meanwhile taking the position of an observer in the interaction.\n\nThat said, I don\u2019t think the movie Ratatouille was nearly that problematic, nor would I draw those comparisons when talking about the movie.

            "There's a lot of possible reasons here. It's hard to know without any further details because I don't really know what you're experiencing.\n\nWhat kind of terrible do you mean? Are you exhausted? Stressed out? Depressed? In physical pain?\n\nWhen are you feeling that? At the start of exercise, in the middle, towards the end, after you finish, the next day?\n\nWhat kind of exercise are you doing? for how long, how often? Is it literally all kinds of exercise that make you feel this, from a brisk walk upward? Or are you doing something intense? \n\nI'm not a doctor or anything btw, just someone who knows some stuff about biology and managed to develop a more active lifestyle over the past few years of my life. This is just the basic information I'd need to give you a real answer to try and help you out best.\n\nEdit: the quickest answer I can give is that any intense exercise usually feels tough at the time even when you're used to it, and when you're not used to it the feeling of it being difficult overpowers any good feelings it might already be generating. Usually it feels best afterwards though, as endorphins operate on a relatively slow timescale (minutes-hours) and maybe even get released more post-exercise than during (emphasis on the maybe - I don't actually know exactly how they work in this context without looking it up). In any case, I usually feel the post-exercise 'glow' best once I've finished, stretched, showered and eaten and those steps are pretty important after any moderate to high intensity exercise, I think they contribute to the . In general, it's always tough when you're starting out a new type of exercise whether you're already very fit or not. It gets easier.

            "Trainer at a boxing gym here. Here is an overall tip:\n\n\n\nExercise should be seen as a celebration of what you can do, not a punishment for what you ate. \n\nSo how do we get there?\n\n\nApproach exercise with an attitude of exploration and find something you really enjoy. Any activity that allows you to move your body in space is valid. Walking, dancing, yoga. Some people are motivated by being a member of a team, and gravitate to basketball or other team sports. Some like solitude and choose running or other activities done alone. Some are motivated by the honing of skills, and ju jitsu or other martial arts are attractive. There are an infinite number of reasons to be attracted to any activity, and an infinite number of ways to make any activity \"exercise\".\n\nThe best exercise routine is the one you can't wait to do, so keep exploring until you find an activity you love. It's out there, no question. \n\nOnce you've found one, (and BTW it's ok if it changes constantly) the activity itself will motivate you to push yourself. Start slowly.  Low effort over time is much more effective than \"heroic\" effort sporadically. You don't take all your medicine at once. The body gets better at handling strain, and you will begin to feel much better over time.",
            "I almost always feel like shit after a boring excrrsice. That' was true even when I was in shape, although to a lesser degree. Even less if it si fun, which is rare, but still not really positive. I do feel better in general if I do it regularly.\n\nI think it depends on a person, like every other chemical.\n\nDiazepam calms me down, no effeft on sleep. Some people are knocked out by it.\n\nZolpidem makes me sleep and feel groggy in the morning. Some people are woken up by it (this also happened to me twice so I get it, it seemed exactly the opposite of what it usually did.\n\nTHC usually makes me wanna do interesting mental things (no matter the strain), but rarely calms me down. Some people experience the opposite ratio.",
            "This happens to me. Not new to exercise, I know what I\u2019m doing, but more often than not I\u2019ll show up feeling fine and leave feeling weepy and pissed off.

(I\u2019m sure it doesn\u2019t help, though.)\n\nThat said, I deal with depression and am on an antidepressant, and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s some cocktail with my own body chemistry that\u2019s causing the problem.

            "Probably because your muscles haven't been conditioned for it yet. When you get sore or achy after exercise it's because you are building muscle, which literally requires muscles to tear (microscopically) in order to reform stronger tissue. Once your muscles have built up a bit it's easier to recognize the good feelings that come with exercise because the initial soreness isn't prominent. If you've been experiencing this for months you are probably doing a workout that isn't right for your body and should as your gyms trainer (if they have one) or even your doctor or a physical therapist what exercises you should be doing instead. Also, performing the right exercise wrong can have really bad side effects, so always make sure you understand the machine before using it. Good luck!",

            "Try out different types of exercise. Some people like running, other people prefer weightlifting, and others might feel best when they\u2019re doing moderate swimming.

You can also try out these exercises at different intensities. \n\nSome ideas: kickboxing, cycling, ultimate frisbee, rock climbing, dance, soccer, basketball",
            "While exercise does trigger the release of endorphins, it also damages your muscles and burns energy. Perhaps you don't exercise that frequently, and your body is not used to that result, so your body's response to that damage, irrelevant of the endorphins released, is to tell you \"Hey, I feel like shit! We shouldn't do whatever the hell that was again!\" This can be dealt with by exercising regularly. The more you experience something, the more desensitized you will become as your body learns \"Hey, this thing I hate isn't as bad as I thought. It sucks, but it's not as bad as I thought,\" and the exhaustion and burning from exercise will fade to tolerable levels.\n\nIt could be that your brain doesn't like you, or that chemically something's up that's causing these chemicals to behave incorrecctly when interacting with your receptors. Maybe the exercises you perform don't trigger sufficient release of the happy chemicals, maybe your medication doesn't like the happy chemicals, maybe something you ate or somethin going on in your life is looking at the happy chemicals and whacking them in the face with a shovel!",

            "I also feel terrible every time I exercise, but I\u2019ve been playing RingFit for a couple of weeks now and I legit can\u2019t have enough of it... except of course at some point I have to stop. It\u2019s not an incredibly tough workout, but it\u2019s been making me feel really good and it improved my mood tons. So maybe you just don\u2019t like the kind of workout you\u2019re doing? Like maybe weighs aren\u2019t your thing and running is more rewarding? Dunno, try doing different things until you find something that makes you want to do it again the next day. Also, you don\u2019t need to spend hours exercising. 20 minutes/day should be enough.",
            "It takes a certain fitness level to hit the endorphin rush. You have to work up to being fit enough to run/bike long enough. Which kinda sucks. But when it finally hits, oh God. Changed my life, I'm a cardio guy now and used to be fat my entire life. Now a normal weight. \n\nMy best advice is start slow and remember, if you ran even .01 of a km/mile today, you lapped everybody on the couch :)",
            "1. depends on the person whether you endorphins give you high. on some it might make a huge effect and the total opposite on you\n2. maybe you're unused to it. \n3. lactic acid. \n4. trauma. you hurt yourself somewhere maybe, could have happened with exercise as well.\n5. not a proper heat up and stretch session may turn your training into a nightmare.",
            "not enough exercise, push through the discomfort to find the high",
            "For me, at least, during workout sucks. But once I've finished, I feel great, sometimes euphoric. The best I've felt after a workout was yoga.",
            "This will be long but I will try to help.\n\nYou mostly feel terrible at first because you've spent too long conditioning your body to a sedentary lifestyle.\n\nBut it doesnt take too long to adapt to working out. If you continue to suffer unbearably after 2 weeks, there may be other things preventing you from being able to properly cope.\n\nAll exercise breaks the body down on a cellular level. To an extent, the imnediete damage can be lessened by conditioning yourself to the work being performed and regularly eating a variety of natural foods - fruits, vegetables, meat. \n\nContrary to what's been authoritatively preached in the past, saturated fats and natural sources of cholesterol are crucial for cellular repair, especially after intense exercise. \n\nDepriving oneself of these 2 things in attempts to \"lose weight\" (drop body fat%) is the most counterproductive thing people trying to get into shape can do. If doing this, your recovery periods will last unusually long and will be painful and miserable for you. A lot of \"fitness failures\" occur at this time because the person experiences chronic feelings of hunger despite loading up on \"healthy, whole grain\" blah blah blah CRAP aka **empty processed carbs** while avoiding what their body truly needs. These carbs will be used to replenish some of the depleted muscle/liver glycogen stores that were used during the person's workout, but because there's so many of them in the blood, as a form of protection, the body immedietely converts most of them into fat, no matter how much that person has just killed themself working out. This will lead to body fat % increasing all while feeling like crap during your attempts at getting fit. Most people give up after experiencing such negative results.\n\nYou need natural dietary cholesterol and saturated fat to drop body fat in a healthy manner. Yes, you need the the stuff they say is \"bad\"; its \"bad\" because they say it causes heart disease, and they're not 100% wrong. But this statistical analysis-derived health advice does not apply to non-sedentary individuals. Any doctor will tell you this. \n\nCarbs (technically, excess sugar in your bloodstream) is the real culprit of most forms of heart disease. The bad \"cholesterol\" that kills people in heart disease, is from their own dead, decaying cells that fell victim to the effects of excess blood sugar. Its not from eating steak, eggs, or liver. It's just that people who get heart disease usually dont discriminate too much when choosing what to eat. They typically eat the most palatable foods they have regular access to, which is why time tested favorites like fatty red meat or buttery omelettes, etc etc get a bad rap, in statistical analysis at least.\n\n\nYou should eat fat-rich sources of meat like salmon with real butter, broiled prime cuts of beef or baked chicken thighs, etc etc about an hour or so after working out, EVERY TIME you work out. Fresh vegetables (that you have to cook yourself- you needn't eat them raw, but do eat them with some form of natural fat, like real butter) are important too for the numerous forms of natural antioxidants and trace elements that function in repair/recovery mechanisms that they have to offer. Just eat until you're full. Not stuffed, but satiated. You can (and should) eat again if you're experiencing intense food cravings a half hour or more after finishing this meal. (THIS is a good time to eat a bowl of cereal - you're body is saying \"hey, theres enough fat and fiber in your guts right now to support the slow release of any carbs you feed me - which would be a great, non-harmful way to replenish all that glycogen you used up during your workout today!). \n\nWhat I mean to say is, you dont want to completely cut out carbs. Stick to natural sources like potatoes, home made bread isnt bad in moderation, even a bowl of mini wheats isnt THAT terrible, but always be mindful to limit carb intake and learn to avoid refined sugar (I know I said miniwheats... nobody's perfect lol) as much as possible unless you're eating fresh fruit. And always view sugary beverages as the poisonous swill they are. \n\n\nIt's going to take a few months to the better part of a year of sticking to a \"exercise + eat well + rest and sleep well\" routine before you'll actually begin to experience these habitual workouts more like daily meals... or even, dare I say, a drug of choice \ud83d\ude33\n\nIt really does feel that way eventually, hence why people can experience exercise addiction. And although a small endorphin release accompanies adrenalin during exercise to make the damage being done to the body conveniently imperceptible at the time, it's not endorphins that exercise addicts (or opioid addicts for that matter) crave... its dopamine, which gets released in unnaturally large amounts and processed in unnatural ways when people abuse addictive drugs, but gets released and processed in a perfectly healthy, natural manner by achieving challenging goals we set for ourselves that in some way improve our living conditions. Dopamine enables us to develop healthy habits just as much as it drives us to develop unhealthy ones. \n\nBy the time you get habituated to your workout routines, you will have become more sensitive to dopamine because increased bloodflow and better overall health will increase the number of dopamine receptors on the cells in your forebrain, and accordingly, you'll be able to enjoy and look forward to the little dopamine kick that successfully getting through these routines will provide. There are other, more complex mechanisms that come into play here, but the idea remains the same - exercising is great, self-reinforcing way to get \"high\" that avoids all the negatives of resorting to drug use to make oneself feel better.",

            "because you probably ate like %\\^&%\\^ and there is more to \"feeling\" good than simple exercise. You have to feed your body the right nutrients before you can even contemplate a healthy workout.",
            "With cardio (sweaty hard-breathing exercises) there's a boundary you have to work past. The first minute or two, or even 5, if it feels terrible slow down and work more gently. At a certain point your body burns through its short term energy and starts burning other energy stores, and at this point you will start to feel much better and will be able to maintain the pace for quite a good while.",
            "If you have no tolerance and do too many opiates at once you'll feel like shit too.",
            "Because you probably lack natural testosterone, stop using reddit and get out more and meet some ladies and actually push yourself and go out biking and running you will feel great and get with pretty cool chicks if you talk to them. \n\nExercise feels great when you remove the fake worthless shit from your life and enjoy being with people and being who you truly are.\n\nLifestyle change takes actual lifestyle changes, not just going to the gym for an hour a day.",
            "Because if you didn't produce endorphins you would feel worse. I don't get this idea that a good run, or exercising can make you feel like you're high or whatever, because that certainly isn't the case. I do feel a sense of pride, or a job well done from exercising, but I'm sure that very minor endorphin boost is just the body's natural way of keeping you from feeling like absolute shit for working out.",

After a few minutes you tend to forget that you and other people are naked and you see simply other people enjoying the sun or the water like you do.\n\nI guess nudity is a social construct. What we perceive today as nudity is different from what people in the 1920 perceived as \"nude\" or \"sexy\", and definitely different from what people from other cultures believe.

You're not there to have sex, you know what a vagina/dick looks like... so you don't get hard. Sex is a lot more than just seeing boobs or dick. When you're young though you don't really have that perspective, and if you've spent your whole life being covered up even a glancing peek of someone nude can get you going. Its tantalizing, it's forbidden... it's exciting.\n\nI've seen too much dick in my time for it to ever get me horny by itself.

I was very romantically and sexually interested in them, but that is again, not the object of enjoyment. The enjoyment of a nude beach comes from being nude in public for probably one of the handful of times in your life and experiencing that freedom, and sharing that time with people who are also basking in that feeling.\n\nMy crush and I went there with that understanding so we both had no problem.\n\nIf you go there with the intent of looking at as many naked bodies as possible because of some urge, then yes, you may get hard lol"

I try to focus my hearing on something else- I make sure not to see any logos that are on the screen (fairly easy, being visually impaired) and skip ads as quickly as possible.   \nI'll even occasionally just close a tab if I find that the video has too many ads, and refuse to watch it. I'm pretty stubborn about it, and unless it's a video that I REALLY want to see, I'll find it elsewhere. If it's a content creator that I actually want to support I will suffer through the ads, but still try not to have the advertisements forced on me.",

She's a super good at doing transcripts and when listening to people her fingers do typing motions to type out what they're saying as they talk. And they have done it in their sleep before so it's definitely possible to sign in your sleep",
            "So, deaf people can still make noise and many can still speak if they've been taught to/naturally taught themselves to. \n\nThe brain isn't typically able to do refined and specific movements. Deaf people just do what others do; make noises and sleep talk. Except it usually isn't coherent, as people who are deaf from a young age or born deaf can't really exact their tone (I think I'm wording that wrong, sorry). So, to answer you question, no! They talk like everybody else in their sleep, and I've seen it first hand.",

Her parents didn\u2019t realize she wasn\u2019t deaf until she was about three years old. She still considers ASL her first language and English her second language. \n\nThe instance where I witnessed her signing was kinda sweet. She had a crush on someone at the time and in her sleep, she finger spelled his name, followed by the sign for \u201cI love you\u201d. She just cycled through that same phrase over and over. I asked her about it the next day and she had no recollection of it. \n\nMy sister is congenitally deaf, though, and I haven\u2019t witnessed her sign in her sleep. She sleeps like the dead, once she\u2019s out, she\u2019s OUT.\n\nEdit: spelling",

I'm also just a wild signer though; I break my glasses every once in a while just getting overly enthusiastic and one time sliced my eyebrow with a particularly viciously signed WORRY and stiletto shaped nails.",

            "During the REM state of sleep when we are doing most of our dreaming and prone to talking  out loud, the brain limits movements. It is referred to muscle atonia (or sleep paralysis) and prevents us from doing significant movements while we are dreaming, most likely as a safety mechanism. You may have experienced muscle atonia when you wake from a dream but cannot move for a few seconds, feeling paralyzed. \n\nSo, because of muscle atonia during dreaming, it is unlikely that a person would perform complex signals with their hands.\n\nInterestingly, not every mammal has effective muscle atonia during sleeping, dogs for example, will frequently run and wag their tails during a dream.",
            "I\u2019m a sign language interpreter.\n\nSometimes when I\u2019m falling asleep and thinking about work and things I interpreted that day - I\u2019ll feel my fingers twitch in the direction of a word.\n\nIt always give me a giggle.",

Yes they can sign clearly in their sleep. \n\nMy family are very active sleepers and we all have stories about this. My aunty used the interpret for comedians and musicians she'd sit up finish a joke and applaud herself (shaking her hands kinda like  bad spirit fingers) then drop all the time.\n\nFun fact: CODAs (children of deaf adults) do this a lot too it's based on dominant language generally, it can get really confusing when they're signing to you about something you have no context for and out loud talking about something different.",
            "I have sensitive hearing (autism and ADHD). So, not a direct reply to the question.\n\n\nBut as for signing it one\u2019s sleep: When I was learning ASL in elementary school, my mom said I frequently signed in my sleep.\n\n\nI personally remember waking up to having the Sesame Street Alphabet song stuck in my head and I was instinctively _signing_ along to it.",

When he takes naps during the day in his recliner will sign (ASL) very fast to himself when he wakes up, usually gibberish with some form, but he does lift his hand to do so and doesn't really remember what he has said. Equates pretty well to when a hearing person is abruptly awoken and sleep talks as they wake up. I haven't seen him sign in his sleep, maybe a hand twitch here or there. For reference, he's had a cochlear implant in his 30's. Kind of late compared to kid now-a-days.\n\nEdit: additionally, he will sign to himself unconsciously when reading things, or when he's in deep thought.

Likewise, I know people whose primary language is BSL who consistently see sign in their dreams.   \n\n\nMy guess, sleep-wise is that you'd need more muscle for signing than talking - larger movements at least. So rather than actual sign you'd probably see broad gross motor movements?    \n\n\nQuite often when people sleep talk it's mumbles, in any case.
