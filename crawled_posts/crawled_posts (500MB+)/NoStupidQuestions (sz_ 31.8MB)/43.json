In that case, AT&T was letting DirecTV services stream without counting against the cap. The FCC rescinded the finding less than two weeks after President Trump promoted Republican Ajit Pai to the chairmanship, and carriers have since been free to deploy data-cap exemptions as they wish.\u201d",

            "Telecoms aren't that dumb and won't make drastic changes that the consumer would notice, but do it subtly.  \n\nFor example, if you watch Netflix, you may or may not notice if the quality is a little less than normal.  You might think you just have a bad connection and go on with your viewing.  But if you really looked into it and decided to route your internet through a VPN, you might suddenly realize that your quality has gone up dramatically.  Your provider may have slowed down traffic from that site without you knowing.\n\nThis example isn't what could happen, but what has happened in the past.\n\nEDIT:  Since this post is exploding, I'm adding a couple of links that I previously shared or were shared by others.\n\nhttps://www.cnet.com/news/carriers-throttle-online-videos-almost-all-the-time-according-to-tests/\n\nhttps://qz.com/256586/the-inside-story-of-how-netflix-came-to-pay-comcast-for-internet-traffic/",

Service A has had just launched a bundle deal with DSP 1 the week prior. So SERVICE A was slowing down connection to DSP 2 (the one I work for.)\n\nI wonder if anyone here who works around this stuff noticed it as well.",
            "Lots of legal battles, and that's pretty much it. The supporters of net neutrality's removal point to nothing having changed as evidence that net neutrality wasn't necessary, but it's been absolutely mired in legal battles ever since it happened which is why no ISP's have acted on it (where the legal grounding is more firm, as in mobile carriers, we *have* seen some carriers take advantage of lack of net neutrality, but it's also much much easier to switch to a competitor with a mobile carrier so things haven't gotten too bad).\n\nThings may be starting to wrap up on the legal challenges front, but at the same time states have begun implementing their own net neutrality rules, which is going to effectively put net neutrality back on the table anyway.",

So what they are doing is making simple changes at first such as making you pay for faster speed even though it's all on the same lines. Then what they are doing next is where we are now, and that's bundling services up and partnering with content creators such as the Huhu/amazon/hbo bundles. Then next step is to make you pay for the bundles like you would for cable and packages. They are effectively trying to even the loss of people not getting cable. By this time the frog has been boiled.  \n\n\nedit: some spelling",

That's what net neutrality protected against. NN is all tied up in legal battles at the moment but once the new system drops they will have a loophole to do what they want to do. You may have noticed how companies do the whole \"get up to X amount of speed.\" That's the loophole. If you pay 500 bucks a month for 100gb internet, they could give you 10kb internet with no issue. Now yes, they do do that now but you'll really notice when you see full 5g compared to what your being given.",
            "No company would be bold or stupid enough to do a change that proves we needed Net Neutrality. If they did so, they would be committing an economic suicide, so it will be slowly working to fixing itself and putting us into the position that we are going to be stuck in.

            "This debate leaves one question in my mind, and this might already be asked and answered before but I've never seen it anywhere. Is there any way to completely skip the data provider and get your own data? Not considering things like price and convenience, just the possibility?",

How does education/work get done when students/remote work force doesn't have a 'utility' provider delivering service, an issue millions of unserved Americans deal with everyday.   Given the times the internet is necessary for any kind of modern economy; provider and consumer alike. Imagine the internet just stopped working tomorrow for everyone in America; what would that do to exasperate the number of businesses being shut down, schools unable to educate?  The fact that ISPs have eliminated data caps and halted cutting off services due to non payment makes it more clear now than ever has been in the past. A well served community is much more likely to have better infrastructure, schools, social scenes, you name it and it's better served with internet no matter who that citizen may be... nowadays, any economy of scale has internet services tied to it and last I remembered America is an economy of scale. If anyone say differently, please sway me?  If its in the name of competition, I have different options on where my utility is coming from, how its generated, and then maybe someday I want to buy solar panels and generate my own power (in the same vain of municipal broadband)  It works well enough for gas and electric providers, why not the internet pipes and the data superhighway?",

This is exactly the thing that net neutrality would have prevented.",

They gradually change and push boundaries (to prevent consumer \"shock\")... and they keep going all the way to the line, then try to toe/push that line as hard as they can. The fact that this line was erased, by a clear and obvious corporate plant, means that once you are complacent, once you have forgotten, once your children or grandchildren have grown up in a world never knowing the internet *could* be neutral... they will start pushing. *And they will not stop unless they are forced to.*\n\n\nThat.

Net Neutrality essentially makes it so that current ISPs can't provide preferential treatment for certain sites - good. However, Net Neutrality also adds significant hurdles and legal red tape for smaller ISPs to break into the competition, and increases the cost of current ISPs improving their infrastructure - bad. The doom and gloom, worst case scenario of repealing Net Neutrality would be entirely avoided if there was legitimate competition in the internet service sector, because ISPs that discriminate their service to the detriment of the consumer would lose business. \n\nBy supporting NN, you're essentially accepting regional monopolies and saying, \"You can dick us over, but you can't dick us over *too* hard,\" all instead of tackling the real problem.",

Vonage filed a complaint with the FCC after receiving a slew of customer complaints. The FCC stepped in to sanction Madison River and prevent further blocking, but it lacks the authority to stop this kind of abuse today.\n\n**COMCAST**: In 2007, the nation\u2019s largest ISP, Comcast, began secretly\u00a0[**blocking peer-to-peer technologies**](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2007/10/eff-tests-agree-ap-comcast-forging-packets-to-interfere)\u00a0that its customers were using over its network. Users of services like BitTorrent and Gnutella were unable to connect to these services. 2007 investigations from the Associated Press, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and others confirmed that Comcast was indeed blocking or slowing file-sharing applications without disclosing this fact to its customers.\n\n**TELUS**: In 2005, Canada\u2019s second-largest telecommunications company, Telus,\u00a0[**began blocking access to a server**](http://netneutrality.koumbit.org/en/node/5)\u00a0that hosted a website supporting a labor strike against the company. Researchers at Harvard and the University of Toronto found that this action resulted in Telus blocking an additional\u00a0[**766 unrelated sites**](http://thetyee.ca/News/2005/08/04/TelusCensor/).\n\n**AT&T**: From 2007\u20132009, AT&T forced Apple to\u00a0[**block Skype**](http://fortune.com/2009/04/03/group-asks-fcc-to-probe-iphone-skype-restrictions/)\u00a0and other competing VOIP phone services on the iPhone.

Users who believed they had set the browser to the search engine of their choice were redirected to Windstream\u2019s own search portal and results.\n\n**MetroPCS:**\u00a0In 2011, MetroPCS, at the time one of the top-five U.S. wireless carriers, announced plans to\u00a0[**block streaming video**](http://www.wired.com/2011/01/metropcs-net-neutrality-challenge/)\u00a0over its 4G network from all sources except YouTube. MetroPCS then threw its weight behind Verizon\u2019s court challenge against the FCC\u2019s 2010 open internet ruling, hoping that rejection of the agency\u2019s authority would allow the company to continue its anti-consumer practices.\n\n**PAXFIRE**: In 2011, the Electronic Frontier Foundation found that several small ISPs were\u00a0[**redirecting search queries**](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/08/update-paxfire-and-search-redirection)\u00a0via the vendor Paxfire. The ISPs identified in the initial Electronic Frontier Foundation report included Cavalier, Cogent, Frontier, Fuse, DirecPC, RCN and Wide Open West. Paxfire would intercept a person\u2019s search request at Bing and Yahoo and redirect it to another page.

Verizon had asked Google to remove 11 free tethering applications from the Android marketplace. These applications allowed users to circumvent Verizon\u2019s $20 tethering fee and turn their smartphones into Wi-Fi hot spots. By blocking those applications, Verizon violated a Net Neutrality pledge it made to the FCC as a condition of the 2008 airwaves auction.\n\n**AT&T**: In 2012, AT&T announced that it would\u00a0[**disable the FaceTime video-calling app**](http://www.freepress.net/press-release/99480/att-blocking-iphones-facetime-app-would-harm-consumers-and-break-net-neutrality)\u00a0on its customers\u2019 iPhones unless they subscribed to a more expensive text-and-voice plan. AT&T had one goal in mind: separating customers from more of their money by blocking alternatives to AT&T\u2019s own products.\n\n**NETWORK-WIDE:** Throughout 2013 and early 2014, people across the country experienced slower speeds when trying to connect to certain kinds of websites and applications. Many complained about underperforming streaming video from sites like Netflix. Others had trouble connecting to video-conference sites and making voice calls over the internet.\n\nThe common denominator for all of these problems, unbeknownst to users at the time, was their ISPs\u2019 failure to provide enough capacity for this traffic to make it on to their networks in the first place. In other words, the problem was not congestion on the broadband lines coming into homes and businesses, but at the \u201c[**interconnection**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peering)\u201d point where the traffic users\u2019 request from other parts of the internet first comes into the ISPs\u2019 networks.\n\nAn Open Technology Institute [**investigation**](https://na-production.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/Beyond_Frustrated.pdf) that drew on the Measurement Lab\u2019s data analysis found these slowdowns were the result of \u201cintentional policies by some of the nation\u2019s largest communications companies, which led to significant, months-long degradation of a consumer product for millions of people.\u201d Major broadband providers, [**including AT&T, Time Warner Cable and Verizon**](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/22/major-internet-providers-slowing-traffic-speeds), deliberately limited the capacity at these interconnection points, effectively throttling the delivery of content to thousands of U.S. businesses and residential customers across the country.\n\n**VERIZON**: During oral arguments in\u00a0*Verizon v. FCC* in 2013, judges asked whether the phone giant would favor some preferred services, content or sites\u00a0over others if the court overruled the agency\u2019s existing open internet rules. Verizon counsel Helgi Walker had this to say: \u201cI\u2019m authorized to state from my client today that but for these rules we would be exploring those types of arrangements.\u201d Walker\u2019s admission might have gone unnoticed had she not repeated it on at least five separate occasions during arguments.\n\nThe court struck down the FCC\u2019s rules in January 2014 \u2014 and in May, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler opened a public proceeding to consider a new order.\n\nIn response millions of people urged the FCC to reclassify broadband providers as common carriers and in February 2015, the agency did just that.\n\nSince Trump appointed him in January 2017, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai sought to dismantle the agency\u2019s landmark Net Neutrality rules. In December, the FCC\u2019s Republican majority [**destroyed all Net Neutrality protections**](https://www.freepress.net/press-release/108533/free-press-todays-fcc-ruling-will-not-stand), ignoring the outcry from millions of people.",

However, this is the challenge with Net Neutrality enforcement.  You can't tell if your ISP is just neglecting their infrastructure, actively throttling competitors, or the service provider is having trouble.\n\nAt the moment, the steady stream of lawsuits challenging the repeal has prevented more drastic changes, and I think the virus has played a role in showing people that the current state of broadband in the US is horrible at best.  I also think the recent sale of Frontier's Fiber Internet service in Washington has increased scrutiny over the massive amount of public funding broadband providers are receiving.  \n\nI may be optimistic, but I think that people are starting to wonder why the NTIA is pumping billions of dollars a year into broadband companies when we aren't seeing increased development in the underserved areas that the money is supposed to be supplementing.  I can't find the article, but a few years ago, someone uncovered that nearly all of grant money Comcast received was used to improve profitable areas, but only a very small fraction of the grant money was used to expand broadband service to underserved areas.  Sorry, I got off topic with this last part...",

            "Stepfather is a meaningless title without the interceding party. By definition, a stepfather is someone who a.) is not your father, and b.) is married to your mother. As soon as your mother dies, your former stepfather is no longer married to her, and any relationship to you functionally ceases.\n\n(This, of course, does not mean that you cannot carry on some relationship with your former stepfather as two individual people who have come to enjoy one another\u2019s company and wish to continue to do so. But that\u2019s a personal choice, and this question sounds as though it\u2019s dealing in categorical answers. Categorically, you are now simply two unrelated humans with a shared life experience but no direct relationship.)\n\nNow, ***if***, when your stepfather married your mother (or sometime after), he *adopted* you\u2026then, he is no longer your stepfather, but is now your legal father or adoptive father (exact terminology varies). At least in the United States, *that* is a personal relationship that will survive your mother\u2019s death; i.e., your mother\u2019s death will not annul or end your legal father\u2019s status as your legal father. In *that* case, the woman that he later marries will become your stepmother, and your legal father will become the new interceding party whose continued existence justifies that relationship.\n\nEdit: u/discipleofchrist69 pointed out that a stepfather could be married your *father*, as well, and is absolutely correct. I did not mean to omit that, my bad.",

You man considering him a father, but unless he moved past the dating phase and married your mother, he's not your stepfather and has no parental rights, whether the mother is living or deceased. Boyfriends aren't stepfathers. Sorry.   \n\n\nTwo case scenario:   \nFirst, Let's say the boyfriend did marry the mother, then she passed away. The father's biological family may still have some legal rights to ask a court to grant custody to a biological relative. These are difficult cases, but if you're asking out of legitimate interest, I'd suggest consulting an attorney that specializes in family law.   \n\n\nSecond, if they did not marry, regardless of him dating another woman, he would not be able to raise the child, unless he has gone through a legal process to adopt or to be assigned custodial rights.  Boyfriends have no legal rights to raise the child of a deceased former lover, even if asked to do so in a will. These are always legal matters that must go through the proper channels.   \n\n\nI hope that helps. I also hope this situation isn't one of personal experience for you.",

            "Eyes work by absorbing and refracting light to create an image so the more light an eye can take in, the better it can see. Ants have tiny eyes, meaning that their vision is terrible. Owls, on the other hand, have proportionally massive eyes that allow them to see with incredible detail and range, and even at night when light is incredibly low. An owl can see a mouse running through tall grass while the owl itself is flying roughly 100 feet above the ground, a necessary skill for a nocturnal raptor.",

            "No. Even if they had literally *perfect* eyes. They could not. \n\nThis is because light has a wavelength. Literally the physical length of a given \"piece\" of light (we wont go into wave-particle duality). \n\nFor visible light, this size is on the range of 400-700 nanometers. No light based eyes can see anything smaller than that. \n\nBut there's other limitations. Their tiny heads couldnt even see as well an a microscope because they cant fit the correct size and arrangement of lenses to get the magnification needed. Also, any living thing cant see things with their \"naked\" eye which resolves (after magnification) smaller than 1 eye cell because 1 eye cell can only report how bright, or what color. It would take dozens of such cells to build any kind of image as we know it. ",

Perfect vision in humans sits at 20/20, meaning you can see at 20 feet what others can see at 20 feet. Some like myself end up with better than perfect, I've got 20/13. \n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means that you see far, far, far, far better than an ant. Even if an ant had the kind of visual capability that a human does it would still  see the world as we do, just from really close to the ground. As I understand it, for an ant to have microscopic vision then it's eyes would need better visual structures, but those structures require more space and that would spoil this microscope vision you're going for.",

            "From a library and information science perspective , religion as a category typically deals with texts that are more of procedural, critical, or explanatory in nature. It's the more explicit instructions, commentary, customs/traditions/rituals, and foundational texts that create the actual practice of a religion. Mythology is made up of cultural stories and can be stories related to a religion but it's going to be written in narrative format which is distinct from informative and critical texts.  There absolutely is Christian and Jewish and Islamic and Hindu and Buddhist and so on and so forth mythology, there are classifications for mythologies from all currently practiced religions as well as classifications for the separate religious texts in modern library systems and that's also true for religions that are no longer practiced.\n\nI realize this isn't exactly an anthropology answer but the ways we organize knowledge in a culture both inform how we talk about those things and is informed by how people were already talking about them when those categories were created. I don't know the exact history of it but I do know that separating those two sides of the religion coin is a thing humans have been doing for a long time at least in modern nations impacted by US library standards bc the knowledge organization systems we currently use are very old. And so, since someone searching for mythology texts would have to go to a different section than when searching for religious texts talking about it as though they're distinct from each other becomes a kind of normal or common.\n\nEdit: Wow I did not expect this to blow up so much, thanks everyone for all the great engagement and the awards!

People tend to associate \"myth\" with things that are untrue, but going by the proper definitions, it would be accurate to say that most of the Bible is a mythology, just one that has a lot more believers in the modern day.",

            "This is an issue of conflation. The Ancient Greeks and Viking era Norse had religions, but we don't know much about them. We do have the stories, or myths, associated with these religions. There is a difference between the two. Using Christianity as an example, the story of Christ's death is part of the Christian mythology (myth in this context is not meant to refer to the truthfulness of the story) while Easter is part of the Christian religion. Religion often includes a belief of a mythology (though not necessary), but it is more than just that. We do know a little bit about Greek religions. For example, there was one group that had a festival we know as the Eleusinian mysteries to celebrate Demeter and Persephone.\nTL;DR Religion and mythology are different things and ancient cultures had religions, we just don't know much about most of them.",

Humans have always wondered things like \"how does the sun work\" and \"how can I grow healthy crops\", and while they had *some* scientific understanding, they believed it was God's living above them, all in control. We have science now, so its much harder to argue that \"Zeus is the one making the lighting\" when we [now have science to explain it](https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/k-4/home/F_What_Causes_Lightning_Flash.html)\n\nTo add, we also find out old science ideas are false, or have more to dive into, and I'm sure in the future in a few centuries or what not, humans will look back at some of our beliefs, and be \"confused\" how we could believe or act in some way.",

Both can agree on their belief that during the last supper Jesus turned the bread into his flesh and the wine into his blood, they disagree over whether there is a transformative effect during communion or it\u2019s purely tradition. Or at the very least this was a common debate for a long time between the two. Switching to Greek mythology, there is not this underlying unity in the gods and which one did what or was more or less important. What gods mattered more or less changed from city to city and even from leader to leader. There\u2019s no grand unifying text, or even any real proselytizers. Many things were done in the name of gods but they also were very convenient. Athens for example changed where the anti-Persia money collection was stored from the island of Delios to Athens proper, then suddenly were inspired to build a new temple on the acropolis complete with a massive solid gold statue. Themistocles was inspired to build a massive Athenian fleet to beat the Persians after a prophecy from Apollo. Animals were regularly sacrificed to gods, and the gods always wanted the bits humans couldn\u2019t eat. Towns built temples to city founders and promoted myths that they were demigods like Heracles. These beliefs were important to people, but who actually said and did what is so disconnected and varying that it\u2019s more of a general mythology rather than an organized religion.",

There are more ordained minister a in the Church of the Dude than there are Asatro practicioners.\n\nThat said, the words religion and mythology aren't equivalents and they aren't mutually exclusive. A religion is a set of beliefs and practices that usually involve the worship of the supernatural. A mythology is just the collected stories, myths, and legends associated with a religion. You could think of christianity as the religion but the stories from the bible as being the mythology.",

            "TL;DR: Anyone can create a mythology but only rich people can create a religion. \n\nIf this is something you are thinking about then I would recommend \u201cSapiens\u201d by Yuhval Harari for a look at belief systems and oral traditions from an evolutionary perspective (mixing anthropology and natural sciences). For a more abstract book looking at the philosophy of many major world religions and media in general, I would recommend, \u201cThe Hero With a Thousand Faces\u201d by Joseph Campbell. Both reach the same conclusion that there is no difference. They are both abstract beliefs systems at different stages. A pedantic classification.\n\nThe only difference is how much is written; stories vs beliefs. When humans started speaking it is believed we used oral history to store information in the group. If an individual knows of a lion at the water, it can be communicated to others who haven\u2019t been to the watering hole in weeks. The way these stories are remembered is by telling others. Some stories are so important they are shared w everyone. Multiple times. And maybe embellished. This is mythology. \u201cThe ancestor lion guards the waters at lake Africa\u201d. Essentially wild stories that have some sense of history or realism in them. \n\nThe creation myth is Norse culture is the death of the Ice giants. The creation myth in Christianity is gods voice commanding existence. Today we call these silly stories the creation myth, because we do have no set of beliefs directly related to those stories (and because every major religious belief system has a creation story). The rituals, customs, practices, and lessons from the stories are religion.\n\nThe reason they are the same thing at different stages is because mythology can create its own beliefs and practices related to its stories. If the ancestor lion watches the waters, we should go in teams of two to the water and leave food so he doesn\u2019t eat us\u201d. These beliefs guided people and it was evolutionarily advantageous to spread those stories to others.\n\nBelief system inspired by stories? Check. \nReasoning for belief? Check. \nSpreading the information? Check. \nJustification for spreading information? Check. Looks like religion to me!\n\nIt\u2019s wild to think the oldest paintings in caves are 50,000 years old but the earliest history of writing is only 10,000 years ago. Different mediums of media allow different levels of information to be stored. One picture can tell many stories to many people but they all see the same thing. A story can mean many things to many people and they all see something different. It is our own mind imagining the events. It is reflective of the self. This blurs the meaning behind the original information stored in stories much differently than those in other forms of media. \n\nGreat question! Thanks for letting me rant into the void!",

            "Reading through the comments i'm sort of baffled at the responses. So many pedantic replies about the semantics of religion versus mythology. \n\nWhen OP clearly knows what the differences is. What he's getting at is WHY certain religions become seen as myths and others as facts. \n\nNorse and Greek and Pagan myths were most certainly not seen as such in their day but as much fact as Christianity and Islam are today. \n\nI believe the answer to OP's question is two fold. \n\n1. The religons that OP is referring to were essentially pushed out by modern day religions. When an old belief system is replaced by a new one the old is obviously going to be seen as having been folly, myth and legend. If a new belief system were to take hold Christianity and Islam would surely be seen as the same. \n\n2. There are innate stories in Pagan religions that are more easily demonstrated as false. God's that live on Mt. Olympus. Personifications of natural events that as human have progressed in their understanding can been demonstrated not to have the causes that Pagan religions who came along in a much more primitive understanding of natural events said they did. Naturally it's easier to dismiss religious beliefs that are more demonstrably false. \n\nIndeed it may even have been that as human knowledge expanded is was this knowledge that allowed Christianity and Islam to gain favor to begin with seeing as how pagan religions became harder and harder to believe. \n\nIn the same way Christianity and Islam are becoming harder and harder to believe now that many of their claims to truth and the nature of the world, humans and the universe are demonstrated to be false.\n\nWe see newer religons philosophies and moreals like Mormonism, Scientology Atheism Existentialism and New Age Budhism and spirituality pushing Christianity and Islam into the realm of myth as they no longer serve as believable realities about the world and the universe in which we live.",

            "Bc the populations that worshipped them slowly converted to Christianity.\n\nThe Norse pantheon is just one local version of a Germanic religion that used to be common in Central Europe. Same with Greek pantheon, which borrowed and syncretized gods and beliefs from ASia Minor and the Middle East. And their followers believed in the existence of their gods just as much as Christians, Jews, and Muslims believe in their God and his angels. \n\nAs Christianity spread throughout the Roman Empire and into the regions outside the empire, it became on of the many religions that people might believe in. But it slowly supplanted other religions for various reason.\n\n*  The empire slowly adopted Christianity as the state religion, and this put some pressure on the citizens to adopt the religion.\n\n* Sharing religious beliefs facilitates trade, so the aristocracy and merchants of a kingdom may adopt a new religion over time.\n\n* syncretism allows religions to blend and borrow from each other. Holy days become holidays, gods become angels or saints, and and important rituals become a local quirk of Christianity.\n\nGreece converted faster to Christianity bc it was the center of both the Eastern Roman Empire and what would become the Eadtern Orthodox Church. The Greek pantheon was slowly put aside as less and less people actively worshipped them, cared for their temples, and generally kept them relevant to daily life. Zues and friends eventually became irrelevant, and so passed into myth rather than religion.\n\nSame process happened more slowly in the Germanic and Norse lands bc they were much farther away from the Empire and didnt have the pressure to convert. But eventually those forces of trade, conversions of the aristocracy and pheasants, and syncretism worked their way north through the developing kingdoms. It wasn't an overnight process, but eventually the last openly pagan European regions were in Eastern Europe around the Baltic. \n\nI hope that explains the process. Keep in mind that religions are constantly being created, combining with other religions, and passing out of memory. We're still seeing that process happen to the Norse and Greek pantheon right now!",

            "It reminds me of going to outdoor events and music shows, so yeah I like catching the smell every now and then",
            "The smell of cloves - they simultaneously make me feel nostalgic and slightly nauseous.",
            "Depends on the quality and intensity. If it's a good cigarette and I only get a whiff of the actual smoke (not the breath) as I pass by, than it's pleasant and nostalgic. But at places like casinos it's straight overkill. \n\nI was born in the 90s so I never really experienced the scent of indoor smoking like older generations did. Did grocery stores and restaurants used to smell like casinos in the past??",
            "I think smells in general are so visceral to brains that they can really easily bring about nostalgic feelings!\n\nIt's prob a great sign for you and your environment that cigarette smoke is rare enough to act as a nostalgia trigger. Hope it can be that way for all of us soon.",
            "No, but cigars are. Always reminds me of my great grandpa.",
            "You\u2019re not the only one. Long story short my babysitter used to smoke outside her house when I was under her care. She was a godsend to me, being from an physically abusive home. Every time I walk past a smoker now I\u2019m reminded of that safe place as a child. And no, I don\u2019t smoke myself.",
            "My mom smokes. Something about a car full of cigarette smoke to this day reminds me of her. It's an unpleasant experience, but I love my mom so it's nice in some ways too.",
            "I know this is terrible, and I\u2019ve never admitted it to anyone, but smelling cigarette smoke has always been a pleasant thing for me. Idk why, it\u2019s akin to smelling a candle or flower. I don\u2019t find it offensive at all.",
            "Yeah, I actually prefer it to the weird fruity smoke that everyone deals with now. Good old fashion tabacoo will always have a special place in my heart, a simpler time.",
            "It\u2019s mostly nostalgic to me as my grandad smoked a lot when I was younger so the smell always makes me think of him. Can\u2019t really stand the smoke very long because of asthma though but if the smell lingers on someone I don\u2019t directly mind it",
            "When I was 12 or 13 I had plans to stay at a friend's house and I wanted to bring some of my smokes. I knew my dad would beat my ass if I got caught with smokes at school so I decided to hide them in an Altoid tin. However, I still didn't trust that I wouldn't be caught so then I decided to make a ham and cheese sandwich and hide the Altoid tin inside of the sandwich. I managed to make it through the day (the ol sandwich trick works every time \ud83d\ude06) and when we got off the school bus I pulled out the sandwich and told my friend I brought a pack of smokes for the weekend. He had a pretty amazing reaction to my smuggling scheme. To this day when I smell cigarette smoke in frigid air it transports me back to that weekend.",
            "Yes",
            "Reminds me of vegas",
            "Smoke reminds me as Las Vegas, you know the casino and stuff. Man, back in the days, it is hecka amazing",
            "Yes. Both my parents are still heavy smokers, have been since I was young (90s), & anytime I smell cigarettes, I'm taken to some memory. \n\nI smoked for a short time in HS, but it was strictly a rebel move, & I actually hated it. But I love being around people smoking. \n\nSecond-hand smoke, blah blah blah, my health is fucked for other reasons, I'm gonna enjoy my life while I'm living.",
            "My mom chain smoked when I was a kid. These days when I smell cigarettes I think about sitting on that green and gold shag carpet playing Mega Man 2 petting my first cat.",
            "Only from about 10' away downwind and for about 3 seconds.  It is nostalgic in the same way as someone with a truck with a carburetor passing you on the road is.",
            "Smells like grandma",
            "Totally. But for me they remind me of the smell of one of my favorite snacks as a kid: boxed raisins. Not sure why but the two smell exactly the same to me",
            "I miss all the friends I made on smoke breaks.",
            "Makes me nostalgic for my pack and a half a day habit. Then I remember how good my lungs feel when I wake up in the morning.\n\nCouple of hiccups along the way, but otherwise smoke free for the last 11 years.",
            "I gave up smoking 7 years ago and whenever I smell cigarettes smoke, it comforts me. \n\nNo way would I ever start up again but it does conjure memories of fun times in my younger years.",
            "When I was a kid my mom lost me for 2 years and I lived with my grandparents.  She was a heavy smoker so every time she would send me a care package it smelled like smoke. I started associating the smell with missing mom. Still makes me think of her now, 25 years later.",
            "It makes me think of simpler times.",
            "Both my grandma and my aunt smoked Mistys. Personally, I've never smoked habitually except for Newports here and there, and I never liked doing it but I secretly always liked the smell of cigarette smoke. I think it's strange to admit that since smoking is what eventually killed my grandma and aunt, but there's something about it that brings me back to my childhood when they were around.",
            "I both love and hate this.\n\nI was a long time smoker. Smoked from the age of 13 until 26. \n\nI quit cold turkey because I don't think I could have done it any other way.\n \nI still dream of smoking, buying a pack and smoking, the smell, the feel, the nostalgia. It haunts me. \n\nI'm 38.\n\nWhen I walk by somebody who smokes, or when somebody smokes a fresh cigarette near me...I enjoy it. They say they are sorry and want to put it out, but no. Just. Smoke near me. It's fine.",
            "Not really, it stinks. I currently smoke and I hate the smell. Trying to quit but its not easy after 35 years. At least the vape smells better.",
            "I'm a non smoker and smoking is generaly disgusting to me, but my father smokes. And he used to smoke much more when I was a kid, now he smokes mostly the electronic cigarettes. Although it smells bad, it definitely gives me the nostalgic vibes at the same time whenever I smell the cigarette smoke.\n\nFunny story - smoking in restaurants got banned few years ago in my country. I used to go to this underground pub in rather wet cellar. Before the ban it smelled terribly of cigarettes beause of poor air conditioning. After the ban it smelled crazy terrible of mold because the cigarette smoke beat the mold before.\n\nI'm happy smoking is banned in restaurants now, but I'm kinda missing it in village pubs.",
            "Kind of.. My mom smoked when I was young and sometimes when someone comes back inside after smoking there's a certain smell that reminds me of her and being a kid.\n Sort of a strange smell to get nostalgic by, but it happens",
            "Yep. I grew up around smokers, but as time went on there was less smoke around me. So now, as a non-smoker, whenever I smell cigarette smoke, I am kinda transported to that time",
            "Cigarette smoke takes me straight back to the 60's when every man I knew smoked, quite a few women in my parents' circle, and all the \"cool\" older kids. My mother didn't smoke and I never picked up the habit. No one talked about cancer or COPD. I was a child so, yes, there is a certain nostalgia, but nostalgia rarely aligns with reality.",
            "I miss the smell, and I miss smoking on flights",
            "i get nauseous when i smell cigarette smoke; that said, i do feel nostalgic when smelling unburnt tobacco like in candle form.",
            "totally with you - always hated the smell of cold cigs in the morning, so my siblings and I made the parents to quit (good for them!), but I started smoking when I was about nine, stopped the day after, then, much later, only with girls at parties, occasionally (good memories, all of them). But yeah, a fresh whiff of second-hand... I love the smell of it in the morning.... there's noting else in the world that smells like it",
            "I like it kinda. Don\u2019t smoke or anything, but it reminds of shooting the shit with the boys at bars. Usually cigarette smoke is couched between memories of laughter and fun evenings with friends. Scent is very strongly linked to your memory. It\u2019s Pavlovian.",
            "Yeah. I don't smoke, but it definitely reminds me of my grandparent's house when I was a kid, as well as sitting near the smoking sections of restaurants. The smell doesn't bother me at all, I just find it kind of nostalgic.",
            "Get a massive dose of nostalgia when stepping into a smoke scented taxi",
            "Yes! I can always tell when someone\u2019s smoking a pack of reds. Sometimes it\u2019s even relaxing to sit around while others smoke (I never have but my parents did a lot).",
            "When I was growing up my parents built 2 houses, and my dad smoked.  To this day, I love the smell of fresh cut wood and cigarette smoke.  It brings back good memories.",
            "YES I love the smell of cigarettes (sometimes)",
            "I like a faint whiff of it passing by smokers in the street in the summer. But not full on cigarette smoke in my face, while enclosed in a room type of smell.",
            "The smell of an actively burning cigarette doesn't do anything for me other than make me wish it wasn't burning. But I had several relatives who used to smoke and the residual cigarette smell that clings to smokers' clothing is nostalgic for me.",
            "YES! My stepdad used to smoke growing up I love the smell of tobacco",
            "A bare whiff or scent reminds me of my chain smoking mom,\nlong since passed away. So that is a good memory. If it is \na room of smoke or someone smoking nearby, then I am \noutta there.",
            "Definitely. Rothmans Special Mild smells like childhood for me. Goes straight to 90s flashbacks.",
            "Not nostalgia to the 90s, but I love the smell of cigarettes, and it gives me nostalgia to pre-covid times, some of my favorite places, and just a feeling of warmth and freedom. It\u2019s worth mentioning that I used to smoke on occasion and I haven\u2019t really since covid, but I love that smell that comes with good memories and a good feeling.",
            "It is for me too. I think it's because I took a trip to Las Vegas with my grandparents every summer when I was a kid (late 90s-early 2000s). We would stay in one of the hotels shaped like a castle or whatever, go to fun restaurants, play carnival games at CircusCircus. So the smell of cigarettes reminds me of those trips, especially of walking through the rows of lit-up slot machines to check into our hotel.",
            "Yes, so much. My dad used to smoke and even though I dislike the smoke itself, the scent it leaves on clothing is pleasant to me. There are fragrances with tobacco notes I plan on getting for this purpose.",
            "For me it is not exactly smoking itself but rather a really specific smokesmell that reminds me of my childhood for some reason. Prolly smth that people around me only smoked when i was little and stopped as i grew up?",
            "Ex smoker here. I'm 50/50 with it. Sometimes it disgusts me and I'm glad I quit, other times the scent is beautifully reminiscent.",
            "My parents used to smoke, they have quit now for about 10 years. But I really loove cigarette smoke. I personally dont smoke. I did it for about a year but quit bc I did not like the taste I had afterwards. But whenever i walk infront of someone smoking I inhale, for the smell.",
            "It throws me back to being 8 years old. My older siblings would smoke at the side of the house, call my name, and make me get them apple juice so their breath didnt stink. \n\nThey made me stay out there while they smoked and made me stay there until they were done drinking juice.",
            "It's very nostalgic to me. A lot of my family smoked when I was little and I don't see most of them anymore so every time I smell a cigarette I'm taking back to those family gatherings",
            "Yup, but I also dont even know any smokers anymore. Everyone I know stopped years ago.",
            "Yes! It takes me back to times I really enjoyed and that are no longer possible. These memories actually stop me from smoking because I do not want to accidentally mess them up with new ones.",
            "I recently quit after 12 years of about a pack a day.\n\n117 days after quitting now... if I smell a cigarette, I want a cigarette. Maybe in 10 years it will remind me of when i used to smoke... hopefully still \"used to\" in 10 years, too.",
            "I was working on a film shoot in a church and I stepped outside to have a cigarette, a tiny elderly lady followed me out and asked if she could stand beside me while I smoked as it reminded her of being younger.",
            "Yup. Never smoked myself, but have some amazing memories of hanging out with friends in bars or concerts with that smoky haze (and not having to spend half the night outside with them), and also various friends and family from growing up.\n\nHonestly I think that bar (and especially concert) scene took a hit when the crowds self-separated at all times with half the attendees outside at any given time. Concerts were definitely lacking something with a less fun social vibe after they got forced outside.",
            "Oh yeah..  my dad smoked when I was young..  so that memory is burned (..hmm...see what I did there?) in...\n\nI'll never smoke anything, but the smell evokes very strong memories for me.\n\nUn-lit tobacco does it for me too, he used to have a box that he kept his stuff in, and I'd sneak a smell often when I was a kid...\n\nHonestly it's amazing I'm a non-smoker.",
            "Only in the sense that the smell of cigars reminds me of my Uncle Norman. He was an amazing man but unfortunately he did pass away from lung cancer nearly 10 years ago now, so it's a bittersweet memory.",
            "For sure.\nEspecially in old hotels.. I kinda like that old smell though",
            "Yup, gave up smoking 10 years ago for my eldest being born.\n\nI loved smoking, and I miss those beautiful little bastards every day (the cigarettes, I still have the kids).\n\nThe smell just fills me full of longing for the old days.",

            "Also with the grandfather memories any time I smell a cigar....",
            "Yes - reminds me of the bus station I spent years at as a kid.  I liked it there.  It was the peaceful place between home and school.  Now whenever I smell that I'm brought right back there and it is very calming.",
            "I get nostalgic about my first love and cigarette smoke. I was too young to date, but was allowed to meet him at dances. I was always arrived early in anticipation of seeing him. He would stroll in, a beautiful smile on his gorgeous face, and smelling of fresh cigarette smoke. I love the smell to this day. Miss you, Mark.",

            "In the 90s my dad always smoked in his truck. He would use the lighter in the truck and there is something very specific about cigarettes being lit that way. That smell is my childhood and about one of the only happy memories I have of my Dad.",

            "My grandparents both smoked for the first 8 to 10 years of my life, when they quit. My grandmother kept an immaculately clean house. So there\u2019s a particular smell I associate with them that is forever gone. \n\nHowever, now and then I get the whiff of a cigarette that takes me back to those days. \n\nI am a lifelong non-smoker, but nostalgia, heck yes.",
            "Hah, yes, OP. That's funny, because I've pointed this out to many people and they think I'm crazy. The smell of cigarettes is like a time machine back to my childhood in the late 80s. My parents always smoked indoors. I remember playing with my Legos on the floor, seeing the bright summer sunlight shine through cigarette smoke haze. It's pretty well understood that smells are very powerful nostalgia triggers, and for me, cigarette smoke is one of the biggest.",
            "It reminds me of vacationing in Florida as a kid. I guess we always had a lot of smokers at our condo. But it makes me like the smell sometimes.",
            "Yes, but not tempting. I had an uncle that chain smoked and drank. Always had family parties at his house playing pool on his expensive pool table and other game he had build himself. I was homeless for a short time in my late teens and he gave me a place to stay for almost a year while I got together enough money to get an apartment. I visited him occasionally and we\u2019d talk and play pool. He passed a bout a year later from mouth cancer. He knew it was his time and threw a big party a few weeks before the end and invited literally everyone he knew and nearly everyone showed up. He was a good guy that went through a lot. When I smell Marlboro lights it reminds me of him and a prayer goes up.",
            "Yes, and I've never been a smoker.",
            "Same here. Smells of the outside of establishments to me, due to that being where people smoked most often. I suppose it reminds me of going home, which was honestly all i always wanted to do when i was going out with my parents (i've always been a homebody, even as a child).",
            "Yup! Two of my best friend's parents smoked in the house growing up, so it reminds me of being in elementary school, sleepovers, and late night prank calls.\n\nIt's funny, cause I smoke a cig every once in a while, and I HATE smelling/tasting them on myself. I immediately change my clothes, wash my hands and brush my teeth afterwards. Nostalgia is a crazy thing!",
            "I never smoked but both my parents did. It reminds me of them and being in my childhood home in better times. \n\nIts not good tho cuz i have asthma and it doesn't occur to me i should be avoiding the smell until i start coughing. :p",
            "Not gonna lie, the reason I hate the smell of cigarette smoke is because my grandpa smoked himself to death. So no not really. I can understand why people would be nostalgic for the smell though if it relates to happy memories for them.",
            "For me, it's exhaust gases. It reminds me of various big cities I visited during my childhood during holidays.",
            "I haven\u2019t smoked in almost 20 years but I still love the smell.  Reminds me of when I was young and carefree enough to not care that it was bad for me. It still gives me cravings too.",
            "No, but cigars. I tie that to my father.",
            "I think of little league baseball every time. Alot of the dad's would smoke. No one in my family did so it always brings me back to those summers as a kid.",
            "Yes! I\u2019ve never heard anyone else say this. I genuinely like the smell of (fresh and not overwhelming) cigarette smoke. Growing up no one in my family smoked cigarettes but a lot of my friends\u2019 parents did, so the smell is really strongly associated with fun weekends and enjoying time with my friends. Plus I\u2019ve always loved the smell of burning so that helps.",
            "My dad and uncle were both heavy smokers for a long time. My dad was up to 3 packs of Marlboro Menthols a day at one point, and quit because it was getting too expensive (and this was back when cigs were like $30/carton). \n\nThe smell of menthols reminds me of fishing and hunting trips and spending time with them.",
            "I miss smoking.   I've been quit for 7 years, cold turkey, and I want a cigarette nearly every day.  \n\nNo one likes a quitter.",

            "I had my first real whiff and knowing when I went to Italy when I was like 12. Not all cigs give me the nostalgia, but sometimes I get a whiff and get transported right back.",
            "My Grandpa was a smoker, smoked in the house for years as a kid. I remember growing up and seeing him smoke. He quit a couple years before my cousin was born, lung cancer took him just last September. But he lived a long happy life. I think of him sometimes when I smell cigarette smoke, sometimes when I smoke too.",

            "I moved out of my parents\u2019 and now live in student housing near my college campus. If people smoke, it\u2019s usually weed or those fruity vapes, but one of my downstairs neighbors occasionally smokes cigarettes. My boyfriend complains about the smell, but to me, it smells like home and my dad in a pleasant way. I miss it.",
            "Yeah, it reminds me of my dad when I was a little kid. They say smell is the sense that brings the strongest memories.",
            "I've smoked on occasion but I've never been a \"smoker.\" In the Army, everyone I knew smoked and I grew to really enjoy the second-hand smell. Weird, I know.",
            "My Dad was a BIG smoker back in the day, but they never smoked nasty cigarettes. I feel like the brand and quality of the cigarettes make a huge difference in the smell. The smell of a cold morning, a hot cup of coffee, cigarette smoke, and my dad\u2019s cologne takes me back. \n\nAs a side note, my wife\u2019s parents roll their own cigarettes and their smoke ruins everything it touches.  Not pleasant at all.",

            "Oh yes for sure",
            "My dad used to smoke John Silvers and my uncle yellow Blends when I was a kid, they're not as popular anymore among smokers here but when I do smell them I am instantly teleported back to my childhood with all that entails of long summer evenings sitting outside by our summer house, or smoke-filled Saturdays when work mates would come over to smoke and drink and watch the horse races that they had betting pools on. Even now when I am all grown up, I try to make Fridays and Saturdays feel special. On Fridays I tend to relax with junk food and watching a movie or a TV series, on Saturdays I indulge in my cooking hobby by trying out new and/or complicated recipes or new ingridients and allow myself to dirty a lot of dishes and spend a lot of time doing prep work, as opposed to my weeknight cooking which needs to be as fast and simple as possible, preferrably.",
            "Cigarettes are nostalgic to me as a whole! I quit smoking and I feel 100% better but I still miss lighting one up. As untrue as it may be they were like a friend who was always there when you needed them.",

            "Yep. Reminds me of my grandmother, also unfortunately later in life when I smoked (thankfully quit 6 years ago), but had some good times hanging on my balcony smoking and also going to parties and not worrying all too much about my health. I am however glad it\u2019s gone and out of my life. It was hell to quit and I do not wish that addiction on anyone.",

            "My parents + all their friends smoked cigarettes + weed since before I was born so I grew up around the smell.  It smells like home + I find it comforting despite the fact that I don\u2019t smoke at all.",
            "Not the smell of smoke, but the smell of tobacco. My granddad always had a pack of Camels in his shirt pocket. The smell of the tobacco in an unlit Camel takes me right back to sitting on his lap with my head against his chest. He was a grumpy old curmudgeon to most of the world, but he couldn't have been gentler or kinder to me and my little sister. Thanks for the memory!",
            "100%. It reminds me of family trips to Tahoe and walking through the casinos to the AYCE buffet (aka childhood heaven lmao). \n\nMore so, my best friend\u2019s dad has been a smoker all his life, and he\u2019s been sort of a surrogate dad for me since the 90\u2019s. I find the smell comforting because of him, and spending lazy summer afternoons at their house laying under the swamp cooler vent with my best friend.",
            "It does for me, but only because my dad would smoke when I was a kid before quitting for a number of years.\n\nIt took me too long as an adult to realize why I\u2019d suddenly get reminded of my dad while walking past random people on the street.",
            "There's something about a newly lit cigarette that smells so much better than the rest of it. It takes me back a long time ago in my brain. I don't smoke, but I've been around smokers in the past.",
            "Yeah they remind me of my dad",
            "All my parterns used to smoke so it makes me feel like I'm not alone.",
            "Most definitely. Where I grew up people were and to this day still are culturally behind by about 20 years. That means that a lot of people smoked. My parents never did but lots of my friends' parents did.\n\nI also had a strong influence in my young life of a lady I called \"grandma Jane\" who retired around the time I was 3 or 4. Her husband didn't smoke while I knew him. I think he did but stopped due to having blood sugar control issues. Anyway, going to their house it was inevitable that you'd have that menthol cigarette smell on you when you leave and it would stick with you as cigarette smoke does for as much as a day or two. \n\nSo depending which brand of cigarette I catch a whiff of I might fondly remember my buddy's dad who smoked Winston cigarettes or my other buddy's mom who smoked... I'm not sure. Something feminine... maybe Virginia Slims? Menthol whatever it was. Or if I smell other menthols that aren't as minty smelling... like Kools or Newport I'll think of \"Grandma Jane\". \n\nIf I'm outside in a crowd like at a carnival, fairgrounds, some kind of festival... that reminds me of growing up and going to all the local fairs, carnivals and festivals where you'd get large volumes of people standing around smoking cigarettes and that smell just hanging low over the crowd. \n\nFurthermore... I started smoking when I was 12 so every brand of cigarette makes me think \"man, I wish I had a cigarette right now\"... I haven't smoked since 2006 and I sure don't want to start again but man, I still think about it. I think about smoking all the damned time. I just know if I start it's a long road toward quitting and I don't need that shit.",

            "Only some brands. I don\u2019t know anything about cigarettes but my useless rectum of an absent father smoked something in particular and when I smell it out and about it brings me back to a tiny brief time we had something good going.\nEdit to add: whatever it is also happens to be the only cigarette that actually smells kind of good.",
            "It's really weird. I like the smell of cigarettes, but I just hate smoking them (I do smoke cigars, just not cigarettes).\n\nI am 24. I remember going to other people's houses, about half the time it would smell like cigarettes. Sometimes, I'll walk into someone's house now and smell cigarettes, and it just takes me back like you said.",
            "Smells like childhood/my teen years . I never smoked cigarettes but my mom did.",
            "my great aunt used to babysit me when i was really small, and things like certain laundry detergents, denny's, and the faint smell of cigarettes reminds me of her in a very pleasant way. i'll never smoke, and i'll never like the actual smell of smoke, but the scent leftover on a jacket or a tshirt is what actually smells nice to me. it's nostalgic. all my favorite old people smoked.",

            "I'm 27 and it's nostalgic for me because I grew up in Las Vegas a while before we moved to Salt Lake and I just associate the smell with casinos.

            "I\u2019m a non-smoker but, so many girls I messed around with in college smoked Marlboro lights.\nIf I smell a Marlboro light I get a little horny.",
            "Absolutely, although to really hit the nostalgia buttons it has to be a certain sort of tobacco smell (no idea what brand/type, I've never smoked personally) being actively smoked, not lingering, and in cold weather. If you're thinking that there might be a specific person of the opposite sex involved in this nostalgia, you're not wrong.",

            "I used to smoke cigarettes quit a few times, then vaped for a few years and then quit that. It's funny because after I first quit cigs, the smell of cigarettes would make me salivate like a fresh baked pie and instantly make me want one, even years after my final withdrawal. But since vaping and then quitting that I no longer have that sensation. Perhaps since I was still addicted to nicotine but no longer associated it with that particularly smell. Either way, I rather enjoy the smell of cigarettes now, and definitely don't mind someone smoking around me as long as it's not in my house or car.",
            "Yes. My mom smoked when I was growing up. She always kept it away from us kids and has since quit, but the smell of a particular cig brand will knock me back to sunny Saturday mornings in the 90s playing games like Megaman Legends, FF8, and Tomb Raider while eating a couple bowls of super sugary cereal.\n\nOfc they're not healthy, and I'm glad she quit smoking, but I'd be lying if I said the scent of coffee and cigs weren't a rainbow bridge directly back to some good ol days.",

            "My father was a heavy smoker and while I don\u2019t miss the smell of cigarettes per se, the smell of stale smoke mixed with something else triggers feelings of nostalgia for me. Like the smell of it mixed with cooking really triggers memories for me.",

            "I\u2019m not a smoker, but most of my friends are. I really disliked being around them while they smoked, but I got over it because they\u2019re my friends. Nowadays when I smell someone smoking, it reminds me of hanging out with them haha, so there is a bit of nostalgia there now",

            "It reminds me of the guy I met in Central Park. We met at the same park bench and smoked cigarettes together (back when you could smoke in public NYC parks) every week, and have long philosophical conversations until it got dark. The smell takes me way back. Now, couple cigarettes with stale beer and it reminds me so much of the pubs I used to go into for meals with my grandma. Loved this post!",

            "For me it\u2019s nostalgic of visiting the dirty streets of downtown San Francisco in the late 90s, early 2000\u2019s as a child. Sometimes the scent conjures up these memories and you know what, for me they were good times and I\u2019ll always love that city.",

            "Takes me straight back to my nans house as a kid everytime. It brings me a sense of calm and peace. Have never understood why people hate it so much but I guess it because of all the positive experiences I have that can relate to the smell.",
            "All of my college roommates smoked, they avoided doing it at the house but on the weekends we'd go out partying and they'd always be smoking throughout the night, yes, it is nostalgic af, this was like 5 years ago but it feels like forever, specially now with masks lol",
            "Strip clubs. Ah the memories.",

            "Yeah. A lot of my extended family were smokers, so I developed an association between simpler times and the smell of (certain) cigarettes. My husband never developed an association like that and so he hates the smell, but I don't mind it at all.",

            "I hate the smell of cigarette smoke most of the time. It disgusts me and triggers my asthma. And stale cigarette smoke is even worse.\n\nBut if I'm outside at a park or a beach and I get a quick whiff of it on a passing breeze...it totally brings me back to my childhood, usually beach days which were the good days. For me, it's gotta be a quick whiff in a fresh air setting, but yes, at such times I too find it nostalgic.",
            "Yep. Cigarette smoke plus a certain cologne (not even sure which one it is) reminds me of my first boyfriend. I dislike smoking and the smell of cigarettes but like that particular combination.",

            "Always takes me back to these big family gatherings my grandparents used to host. Smoking in-doors wasn't seen as as much of a problem back then, so the house always smelled of cigarettes during them. As an introvert, I still associate a pleasant relaxed kind of socializing and merriment with the smell. It's an atmosphere I haven't really gotten to experience again since my grandpa died.\n\nI think these memories are a big factor why I'd really like to get into regularly hosting these kinds of gatherings, myself, one day, if I ever manage to become more financially stable. I'm not really in touch with any of my family anymore except for my parents who live a very reclusive life, so, if I ever wanna experience something comparable again, I'm more or less my own only hope.",

            "It reminds me of when my family would go out to eat at a diner or restaurant with an indoor smoking section. This was back before they did the whole partition requirement to try to block off indoor smoking sections so you would get full whiffs of cigarette smoke just walking to your table across the restaurant. It was only a few years later they just banned smoking sections  altogether in my city. So smoke brings me back to my young childhood and it has always been nostalgic. Family, good food, outdoors and good times was when I was even around cigarettes because my parents and grandparents didn't smoke. I credit that nostalgia with why I smoked for 8 years before quitting finally. Maybe if I wasn't so fond I wouldn't have wanted to them?",
            "I miss dive bars being smokey, that was part of the appeal.",
            "Yeah.  \n\nWhen I smell cigarettes, it reminds me playing at friends houses when I was little.

            "The stale smell of cigarettes is nostalgic to me makes me think of my long passed grandpa and the memories of being with him when I was sick and getting lunch.  I miss that man so much even 20 plus years later. His truck smelled like 40 years of smoking thanks for the memory op.",

            "Yes and no. My neighbors stink up my bedroom. I live in apartments so I guess the smoke travels.\n\nBut there was a time in my childhood were we would often stay at motels, and the rooms smelled of that cool lingering cigarette smoke.",

            "The smell of cig smoke in bars and/or strip joints was a given. Not anymore. If I were to go inside a bar and smell cig smoke (with beer) today I would instantly be transformed back to my carefree days of the late 80s / early 90s",
            "Yeah, my uncle and dad used to smoke when I was young, but my dad stopped when I was 5 and my uncle stopped way later. I ended up picking up cigs for a semester in college and it was nice, but it was so easy to chain smoke them and felt so unsatisfying compared to cannabis. Sometimes I still get a weird craving for them or nostalgia from them even though I haven\u2019t smoked cigs in 5+ years now. It just reminds me of big family gatherings where we\u2019d eat and talk for hours.",
            "Never smoked but grew up around smokers and the smell does take me back to when I was a kid often.",
            "I don't know if nostalgic is the word for me. I've always kind of liked it, as long as it's not too strong or stale. But cigarette smell and weed smell usually sends me back to college, to a specific friend's apartment, and I had a lot of good memories in that place.",
            "Cigarettes smoke always reminds me of going to my Uncle Kenny's house on holidays to grill and hang out with all the other kids. As far as I know he was the only one who smoked cigarettes around us as kids and I'll always associate the smell with him and his car.",

            "I don't smoke and don't like the smell of cigarette smoke, but I like that smell when cigarettes have been smoked in a bar or building. In my hometown, they still have a divider in the IHOP where the smoking section used to be. It still smells a bit like smoke and I love it.",

            "I live in the USA but I\u2019ve traveled to the UK and other parts of Europe quite a bit throughout my life. Whenever I smell the whiff of a cigarette on a cool breeze, I\u2019m immediately taken back to Europe, because it smells like that so often on the streets there. And I miss it a lot tbh. The funny thing is it\u2019s completely different than when I smoke a cigarette myself. Smoking one myself doesn\u2019t produce the same nostalgia. It\u2019s has to be someone else smoking it and just catching a whiff when it\u2019s cool outside. So specific but every single time, instant nostalgia",
            "Yea but only because all the girls I had mega crushes on were little emo scene girls that smoked outside of shows. So while I abhorred the idea of smoking, I spent time outside with them (but never actually smoked).",
            "Only a certain kind of cigarette. I think whatever one the old ladies used to smoke. I spent a lot of time at my great aunt's house in the early 90s and that's what she smoked.

            "Not cigarette smoke but the stale smell of cigarettes in a place I go to. Reminds me of the local bowling alley or a diner like when smoking was allowed inside. Nostalgic in a positive way.",

            "Yes! I said the exact same thing to my wife recently.  We were around my in-laws and they're all smokers.  It brought me back to going out to bars with our friends in our 20s.  The one friend of mine that still smokes uses some fruity vape thing, so it doesn't elicit the same reaction.",
            "I do! Certain brands especially because they smell just like the brand my grandma smoked before she died. \n\nAlthough she never smoked in the house and always made sure us kids were not down wind when she smoked around us outside.",
            "Oh yeah. Reminds me of living at home with my parents in the 2000s. I actually like the smell, even though im not a smoker myself. Reminds me of dad. Miss you pops!",
            "Sometimes my friends will come back from a smoke and immediately apologize when they get back due to how they smell when secretly I LOVE the smell of them and the smoke on their clothes because their scent reminds me of my late father and I almost scoot up next to them to get a better whiff of the sweet smell that reminds me of my dad.",
            "Oh yeah, although Marlboro Reds and another brand that I can't remember.

On cold winter mornings my father would go out early to start the car and have his first cigarette of the day. When we got in the car it would be warm and full of smoke.

            "I actually had a big urge to smoke a cigarette this week because of this. I have 1 pack I keep around for special occasions/drunken nights. \n\nI was feeling super down and hadn\u2019t had a special occasion since covid, so I smoked one during they day. It definitely was nostalgic ;;",
            "Cigarette smoke combined with car leather, specifically, reminds me of visiting my relatives in New York in the '90s.",
            "I didn't smell cigarette smoke at home, growing up.  The most common place to smell it was outdoors, where there were other adults doing things.  So, I associate cigarette smoke with BBQs, and being at the beach.  If you add in the smell of sunblock / tanning oil, it stirs up the kinda confusing embarrassing preteen excitement at seeing girls in bikinis.  Smell is THE most evocative sense.",
            "yup, it somehow reminds me of my earliest memories of disneyland. idk why I associate it with that, I never smoked, nor did my family but it somehow reminds me of that if I happen to pass smokers. don't get me wrong, I still hate that smell.",
            "Specifically I get nostalgic when I smell someone smoking Camels.  When I was a kid our neighbors smoked them and I'd catch a wiff while playing outside or while playing NES inside.  The smell always reminds me of the cool biker neighbors :).  I only catch the wiff of Camels while I'm at a local town festival nowadays.  Always cheers me up when I smell those.  \n\nAlso a faint cigar smell outside reminds me of the one drunk guy that would cheer on little league games when I was a kid.  I don't think he had any kids playing, but I always appreciated the support.",
            "I was thinking about this the other day. It reminds me of the car service my family would use when I was a kid. Danny's in Queens. The cars always smelled like cig smoke. Also reminds me of my grandma because she smoked a lot. The red velvet chairs in her livingroom that scent reminds me of. Just watching TV while she was plowing through a pack.",

            "This is a very interesting question. \n\nWhat Jesus said is in fact a quote: the beginning of Psalm 22, which narrates a story very similar to the crucifixion. \n\nSo Jesus shows that this part of the scripture is being fulfilled and therefore shows the meaning of what is happening. \n\n[link to psalm 22](https://www.catholic.org/bible/book.php?id=23&bible_chapter=22)\n\nYou can see that this psalm concludes with the proph\u00e9tized return of God, which Christians understand as a prophecy of Jesus resurrection. \n\nSorry for bad style and English, as I am not a native speaker.",
            "He is reciting the first line of Psalm 22. Jewish men were expected to memorize the Psalms and recite them after hearing the first line. He is giving his only disciple that was there and any other within earshot encouragement. I would suggest a reading of Psalm 22. \nThe Psalm starts out very bleak but has an ending that praises God, it's very good when one considers the entirety of what is happening and what will occur in three days.",
            "The narrative function of Jesus' outcry is, as said by u/kwalsh43, to indicate that we are now at the worst part of the story, but it will turn around. The gospel of Marc, on which the other two gospels who mention this phrase are based, has a decent narrative structure, so the inclusion of this outcry is most likely not a plothole. The first audience of the gospel of Mark was Jewish, or had familiarity with Jewish scriptures, like the Psalms. It is just like someone nowadays would say \"All the world 's a stage...\", we would associate that immediately with Shakespeare (well, at least some of us would). \n\nTheologically speaking, there are two more things to say. First: according to Christian theology, Jesus has two natures: he is fully divine and fully human. The phrase at the cross is spoken as a human, not as God. \n\nBesides, there is another dimension, which relates to the Godforsakenness of Jesus. You can argue that by being completely being abandoned by God, Jesus bears the full weight of sin, since sin is basically everything in which God is not.",
            "Ah, finally a question that I can answer, albeit from a historical and a literary perspective rather than a spiritual or theological one.\n\nMany people imagine the early versions of Christianity to be somewhat similar to the various denominations we have today (such as Baptist, Methodist, Catholic, etc) when in reality they were vastly different. Before common Christian orthodoxy was established, there were multiple different views, especially about the nature of Jesus Christ.\n\nOne of these early doctrines was called separationism; the belief that Christ was not only human nor only divine (as some other sects believed, namely adoptionist and docetists, respectively),  but as two separate entities, one human and one divine. The general belief was that Jesus was a man who was indwelled by the spirit of Christ. The most common sect of Christianity that held this belief were the Gnostics.\n\nI won't go into detail about the other things that the Gnostics believed, but one scripture that they point to as \"proof\" for their doctrine is the one you are referring to;\n\n\"And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?\"\n\n- Mark 15:34 (also, Matthew 27:46, but Mark is believed to have been written first and served as the source for this verse in Matthew)\n\nThere were also other non-canonical gospel sources which supported this separationist doctrine to an even greater extent. In the Gospel of Peter, Jesus is instead quoted as saying \"My power, O power, you have left me!\", And in the Gospel of Philip, the verse instead says \" 'My God, my God, why O Lord have you forsaken me?' for it was on the cross that he said these words, for it was there that he was divided.\"\n\nSome scribes, in response to this, actually altered the text of the Gospel of Mark to read \"My God, my God, why have you mocked me?\".\n\nIn general, The book of Mark is interesting in that it portrays Jesus with more anger and bitterness than the other gospels that were later written. Many times when people question the ability or authority of Jesus, they are rebuked or scolded by him, or by the narrator. It's possible that this was because Christianity was still in its youth, and the author of Mark felt the need to preemptively defend the faith.\n\nInterestingly, in contrast, the book of Luke portrays Jesus as compassionate and incredibly faithful; Jesus faces his crucifixion with peace and resolve, rather than begging God and the garden of Gethsemane for his life to be spared. Note that the Gospel of Luke also omits the \"forsaken\" verse, but instead concludes with Jesus saying, as if he has accepted his fate, \"Father, into your hands I commend my spirit.\" The narrative of Luke serves to portray the martyrdom of Jesus, likely in a way that would serve as an inspiration for martyrs in the early Christian Church.\n\nSource: Bart Ehrman's \"Misquoting Jesus\", which I just finished reading a few weeks ago. I'm an atheist, but very interested in the history of religion. I highly recommend this book even if you are a person of religious faith.",

            "Actually, when you read the new testament (I believe it's nead the end of Luke??... I should know this) Jesus goes into the garden of Gethsemane to pray to God, when he is recorded as sweating blood because he prays so fervently to his father to \"let this cup pass over me,\" but afterwards states \"not my will, but yours, be done.\" So he really did not want to have this happen and was genuinely scared, as he was fully man and experienced all the same feelings and weaknesses we would.",
            "So the Bible describes God as holy and cannot look upon sin.  Jesus while on the cross took upon him the sin of the world past, present, and future.  This alienated Him from the Father for the first time ever.  He always had the presence of God with Him even after leaving Heaven.  This was a very different situation because not only was he apart from the Father now, but God's wrath was poured out upon Him as He was literally paying for the sins of all mankind.  We have no idea what He was actually going through mentally except for the glimpses we receive from a couple passages that give slight hints.  And He wasn't really accepting of His fate either.  He prayed in the garden of Gethsemane for God to take this away from Him if it were possible...it wasn't.",
            "Jesus is fully human (as well as fully God). He actually struggled with accepting the cross near the end. See [here](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+22%3A39-44&version=NKJV).\n\nUltimate suffering includes feeling that God has completely abandoned you. Jesus suffered even this.",
            "My favorite interpretation comes from the theologian, Jurgen Moltmann. Moltmann was recruited as a youth into Hitler\u2019s army. He surrendered himself to the British forces first chance. Though raised an atheist, he took an interest in the Bible provided by the British chaplain. When he opened and read Jesus\u2019 exasperated sense of God forsakenness on the cross, Moltmann knew this person understood what he was experiencing. For Moltmann, God experiences God-forsakenness for the sake of solidarity with those who feel the same.",
            "So my comment is going to be very against the grain, but in line with what you would find in biblical scholarship and posts on r/academicbiblical, but here it is. \n\nThe gospel authors did not compose their accounts knowing that they would be put together into one New Testament. They didn\u2019t write their accounts to be harmonized with other accounts or as supporting text for one another. The Gospel of Mark wasn\u2019t written to support the Gospel of John and vice versa. The author of Mark wasn\u2019t aware of the other three. Matthew (the author of; all the gospel authors are anonymous) and Luke both were aware of Mark (and copied from his text), and John possibly knew about the Synoptics (the first 3 gospels).\n\nModern readers tend to blend the narratives of each gospel as if they are saying the exact same thing, but that is not how the authors wanted their respective text to be read. The author of Mark wrote his text to say what he wanted to say and not to support someone else\u2019s opinion. *Each gospel should be read for its own accord as an independent message.* \n\nThis blended reading is a result of reading them vertically, i.e. one after another. But if you were to just read, say the crucifixion narrative, in each gospel, you can see that they are very different **and even contradictory** in some places. \n\nScholars debate whether or not Mark portrayed Jesus as \u201cdivine\u201d (divine in antiquity doesn\u2019t always mean = God Almighty) but what is clear, is that in Mark, Jesus is not on the same level of God and doesn\u2019t always know what\u2019s going on. Mark is all about \u201csecret knowledge\u201d and you can see this in the way Jesus does miracles in private and encourages his followers to tell no one about what they see. Mark\u2019s Jesus is clearly subordinate to God, and is the dying human Son of God (messiah). \n\nCompare this to Luke\u2019s crucifixion story. Jesus is very much in command of the situation. He tells the weeping women \u201cweep for not for me, but for yourselves.\u201d Instead of asking the Father, \u201cwhy have you forsaken me?\u201d He says \u201cI command my spirit onto thee.\u201d He is clearly in control of the situation and knows his mission to be the atonement for mankind\u2019s sin. \n\nI encourage you to check out Bart Ehrman\u2019s work on the topic. [His blog](ehrmanblog.org) has several posts on that exact question.",

            "So, the doctrine as (as far as its taught in my sect) is that in order for Jesus to pay for the world's sins, he had to also experience all of the physical, mental, and emotional pain that it was possible to experience, since sin almost invariably sin has natural as well as spiritual consequences. This couldn't be accomplished without Jesus experiencing what it was like for people who have gone so far afield that they can't feel God's spirit *at all*. So the idea is, at the very end, God withdrew his spirit so Jesus could have that experience, and then he seems to voluntarily die right after.",

            "How it was explained to me as a kid, was at that moment Jesus was taking on all sins, past, present, and future of all of humanity onto himself.  The sheer disgust that God felt at that moment, seeing all that sin, billions of people, 10s of thousands of years, he had to turn away.  Jesus, in a moment of terror, being crushed under that weight of sin, felt his father turn away.  Thats why he said what he did.",
            "He actually doesn\u2019t say Father, He says \u201cGod\u201d. It\u2019s the only time in the Bible Jesus doesn\u2019t call God Father. Because in that moment He had taken our sin upon Himself. He became our sin in that moment, so He had \u201ctaken our place\u201d. So in that moment He was in our position. And God had forsaken Him, literally. For the first time in Eternity past, God had to separate from Jesus, God had to turn His face from Jesus. God cannot look upon sin. Jesus took upon Himself the punishment of all sin that will ever be committed. And so God had to forsaken Him during that time. \n\nJesus was not cool with it. The crucifixion wasn\u2019t what He was worried about. Becoming our sin, something we can\u2019t comprehend what that truly means (extradimensionally, a holy righteous God becoming our sin). \n\nJesus prayed to God the Father 3 times SWEATING BLOOD praying and crying out \u201cIf there is any other way (For humanity to be saved but by His becoming our sin on the cross and being separated from God the Father) then may this cup pass from me\u201d\n\nWe know that God would answer Jesus prayer, this proving there was no other way to redeem humanity but by His atoning sacrificial God-death on the cross. \n\nHe experienced eternity in Hell for us (in another dimensional sense), became our sin. And then was risen by God the Father glorified at the right hand of God the Father. \n\nGod, the creator, entered into His creation, and laid down His life. No one could\u2019ve killed Him, He allowed Himself to die, and used His body, His God-life, and the precious blood of the living God to pay the price of ALL sin. But it\u2019s a gift you must accept and receive. \n\nGod isn\u2019t going to create some separate kingdom for people to live in joy and peace for all eternity for those who hate Him and deny Him. \n\nHe purchased us with His blood. To become His bride, and His body. We will be made one with Him, and we will be in Him and Him in us. We will inherit all of creation and Heaven, and share in His deity and glory, being one with Him as He is one with the Father. But only if we call upon Him and receive the outpouring of His Holy Spirit within us to seal us and dwell within us. And call on Him as Lord\n\nWe have to acknowledge we have broken God\u2019s law, that we are bankrupt and cannot afford to pay our debt, and we desperately require a saviour. Then accept God as that saviour. Acknowledging the fact He did it all for us. \n\nRealize God loves us that much. Every single one of you. He was not willing for you to die. He did everything for you. God Himself, literally died for you. He paid it all for you with the precious blood of the real living God. \n\nRealize that God would be just for us all to perish. That\u2019s what would be just. We have all sinned. We have all fallen short\n\nWe did not DESERVE for God to do what He did. Giving His only begotten son, God in the human flesh. We didn\u2019t deserve that. It\u2019s really the least deserved thing in comprehension, and then to be one with God, and to share with His deity and glory. But He loves us that much... \n\nGod is love. And God is good. Full of mercy and compassion. We deserve death, and separation from God. God holds us accountable even by the creation alone to realize there is a God. \n\nBut realize God did everything you can imagine. All but make you receive that gift yourself. You have to accept it. If I give you a gift, if you don\u2019t take it from my hand you can\u2019t use it. If you leave it on you doorstep you can\u2019t use it.. \n\nFirst God appeared to many people. Then God spoke to people through Prophets.\n\nThen God entered His creation and performed many miracles and signs that were prophesied for thousands of years. Jesus fulfilled over 300 prophesies. \n\nHe lived a sinless perfect life. Suffering all the same temptations we do as humans. And took our sin upon Him on that cross\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the cross that He dreaded. That\u2019s a human thing\n\nIt was becoming our sin. It was being separated from God for the first time\n\nNow there is a MAN, a human MAN sitting on the throne of God in Heaven. Covered in scars. The only scars in Heaven. \n\nRepent, and acknowledge your sin. And your need for a saviour. Call on Jesus to send His Holy Spirit to dwell in your heart, and He WILL. And you will experience something, you will experience knew life and understanding through His Spirit. You will awaken to the true knowledge of the Universe\n\nNot all Christians have the Spirit of God. \n\nMost of them don\u2019t. Don\u2019t use every Christian as an example. \n\nWe are also still a fallen race. Until we get our glorified bodies we are susceptible to sin. \n\nTo redeem the earth and humanity, it had to be a man, who lived a sinless life. Only those pre-requisites would allow you to own earth. \n\nSatan usurped it from Adam who sinned. \nJesus redeemed it\nAnd will come back to claim it officially and create it anew",
            "I\u2019m an atheist now, but when I worked in the church they interpreted it this way (keep in mind, there are multiple ways to interpret any part of the Bible):\n\nAt that specific point, all the sins of man were put onto Jesus, as he was about to be sacrificed to forgive us for all our sins. God is perfect and cannot associate with sin, which is why you must accept Jesus\u2019 sacrifice to absolve you of your sins. So you can go to heaven. So, at that point in time, previously sinless Jesus was suddenly burdened with all the sins of man and was no longer able to speak/connect with God in heaven, which is why he said \u201cWhy have you forsaken me?\u201d He could no longer feel God\u2019s presence. \n\nAlso, of course, it was an important part of prophecy, so it fulfilled that. \n\nBefore anyone argues with me on this, I don\u2019t believe in the Christian God, so I\u2019m not saying this is a fact.

            "> So why does Jesus randomly say \"father why have you forsaken me on the cross\"?\n\nIsn\u2019t the line \u201cMy god, my god! Why have you forsaken me?\u201d\n\nI wouldn't call that \"random.\" My understanding from a religious upbringing was that this was an indication that god had withdrawn his spirit / support / presence from Jesus at that point, leaving him with the full weight of the suffering \u2014 both physical and spiritual \u2014 that came from taking on the sins of the world.\n\nI was taught that we should view that line as an indicator of just how awful it is to have god turn his back on us \u2014 so awful that even his own son / alter-ego couldn\u2019t help but give voice to his anguish when it happened \u2014 and also as an illustration of Jesus\u2019s humanity. He was, after all, still a man being brutally murdered, according to the story.\n\n> He seemed to be incredibly accepting of his fate before that point.\n\nYou\u2019re forgetting the prayers in the garden, no? Where he asks multiple times for god to \u201ctake this cup\u201d from him \u2014 to find another way?\n\nYes, he\u2019s ultimately accepting, but he clearly isn\u2019t a fan of the whole idea as the end nears.\n\n> This always struck me as odd.\n\nWell\u2026it may very well all be bullshit, as far as anyone has been able to convincingly demonstrate (to me, at least). I don\u2019t think we should be surprised to find that a piece of mythology first written down by anonymous, ancient people and then regurgitated through countless other lenses comes out not making a whole lot of sense.\n\nBut in this case, I think it\u2019s decent writing. It\u2019s a poignant moment, regardless of whether or not you think it actually happened.",
            "Because Mark described Jesus's last moments as a suffering man that was having a moment of doubt in his excruciating pain.\n\nBart Ehrman has some interesting videos where he talks about how each gospel author had their own independent story to tell and should be read as such.\n\nWhen you mash all the gospels into one story then you have a dying man that is truly afraid and suffering, unsure of what is happening to him and you have a superman that has zero doubt of the outcome. And it makes no sense unless Jesus had split personalities.\n\nIn this verse the last words of Jesus are \"my god my god why have YOU forsaken me\", and he dies. A depiction that tries to talk about the root of suffering and how we die alone and afraid. A haunting description of a very real man dying before our eyes.\n\nIn Luke Jesus yells out \"Father, into your hands I commit my spirit\" and he dies. Two distinct stories with different lessons to be learned.\n\nSadly, as you can read from these responses,  most christians cant appreciate the stories in this way. They fetishise the bible in such a way that they cant accept that the authors of the time dint tell stories as a news report of what they witnessed.  They were writing moral plays and not describing literal history.

If you wanted to bring a passage to someone's attention, you'd just quote the beginning of the passage as most Jewish men would've had the entire Hebrew Bible memorized. \n\nHe wanted to remind the Jewish leaders of Psalm 22, which has pretty much always been regarded as a messianic prophecy by the Jews. Many people today would have you believe that the Father had in some way abandoned Jesus. Some will even go as far as to say that Jesus lost his divine nature while on the cross. None of this is true, though. \n\nIf you read Psalm 22, it describes the crucifixion of Jesus in perfect detail. So, Jesus quoted it as if to say to the Jewish leaders that had him crucified, \"Look what you've done. You've fulfilled this prophecy. You've killed the Messiah.\" This in no way suggests that God turned away from Jesus. In fact, Psalm 22 specifically says that God did NOT turn his face away. \n\n\"For he has not despised or abhorred the torment of the oppressed.

            "This most likely answer was because the author of Mark likely believe the Jesus (the man) was separate from Christ (which with the spirit or power of God that was within him). This is called the \"adoptionist\" view. If I recall correctly in the oldest manuscript of Mark at Jesus's baptism the text reads \"you are my son, with whom I am well pleased, TODAY I have begotten you. This would reinforce the notion the the author of Mark held an adoptionist view. In a non-cannonical texts (I believe the Gospel of Peter) at the crucifixion a dove leaves Jesus during his crusifiction, which causes him to ask why God has left him. It is likely the author of Mark was implying that Christ (the spirit) left Jesus (the man) during the crusifiction.\n1st century religious scholars such as Bart Ehrman have written a great deal on the subject.",
            "According to the Bible, everyone is sinful (imperfect) and because of that don\u2019t deserve to be in God\u2019s presence. The consequences of that are death and separation from God.

It was like he was being rejected by the Father, which is why he was saying \u201cWhy have you forsaken me?\u201d He did this willingly to pay for the punishment we deserve for being messed up humans. Through his sacrifice we can know God in a personal way and no longer be separated from him.

It's about how the text of the gospels came together, got written, got copied, and got translated. A lot of things that are portrayed as a single incident were more likely several different events being summarized as one story. So, the Sermon on the Mount might not have been a single sermon, but rather a collection of things that Jesus said in related sermons. I think it's very likely that the gospel writers were recording things they heard that Jesus said around the time of his death (they weren't there), and then put them into an order that made sense so them, not necessarily one that is literally true.",

What some ignorant cow wrote somewhere to appear even more intellectually vacant, \"The writer...\", I'll refrain from playing God. However, I think if a person does actually read the story, it becomes pretty obvious in short order that the message was to show the dichotomy between the fallen man and the perfect, God aspect of the Jesus character. It also shows the frailty of mortal man, who even in the person of Christ has doubt, fear, etc. so it's only natural for man to have these feelings and emotions in the same way or more.",

The stress that he was feeling was the pains, sins and other afflictions of everyone- living, dead and not-yet-born so that He could be our Advocate come judgement day (that's a whole new rabbit hole).\n\nThe idea of the Atonement is that He had to feel *everything*, right? That would include God forsaking him, even if just for a moment before He died.\n\nI'm reading some interesting answers here about how he was reciting from Psalms that add depth to this moment- were the Psalms foreshadowing this moment, perhaps? Was Jesus comforting those nearby to help them understand that that very moment was all part of the plan and that better days would come?\n\nThanks- looks like I've got more angles to consider that hasn't before occurred to me!",

            "According to some religious traditions, it was at this point that God the father removed the influence of the Holy Ghost from Christ. This was so Christ could complete the atonement and suffer for the sins of the whole human race. Christ needed to go to a worse place than any human had ever before experienced so he could fulfill the atonement and fulfill the prophecy that he would go below all things (suffering the sins of all mankind and having the influence and companionship of the Holy Ghost fully removed) and rise above all things when he was later resurrected and took his place at the right hand of God the father. This allows Christ to succor us, having suffered worse than any person could suffer, having had the experience, and now being able to guide us through our own personal pain, no matter how deep and exquisite. \n\nFor context, in these traditions, God the father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy ghost are three separate personages just as you, your dad, and your brother are.",

            "This came up recently in a class discussion after reading an article looking to complicate our conceptions of how God can be said to be \"present\" in/with the world.  Specifically, we were discussing a section that brings theologian [Jurgen Moltmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%BCrgen_Moltmann) into the discussion. From the article:\n\n\"We have seen how Moltmann puts his finger on a seeming paradox whereby both divine absence and divine presence are in some sense necessary conditions of the world's existence. It is not a genuine paradox of course, because we can recognize both presence and absence as existing in different modes (or, we might say, at different levels); and, whereas God must withdraw (be absent) in the mode in which he is otherwise present to his own being as God precisely in order to make room for the world's existence alongside himself as a genuine 'other' (i.e. rather than a further form or 'emanation' of God's own existence), in an equally fundamental sense (but at a different level of consideration) as the world's Creator God can never be absent from it, since this would involve its inevitable and immediate disintegration and death.\"\n\nChristian faith identifies Jesus Christ as \"God with us,\" as one of us (taking on materiality, being fully human and fully God). Moltmann later observes:\n\n\"...the incarnate Son has not just God, but *Godforsakenness* (the experience of divine absence) in common with us too.\"\n\nIn this reading, Christ's exclamation on the cross then, is also one of solidarity, that the \"God-Man\" might feel the same forsakenness as we do at times.\n\n**Source:** Hart, Trevor.  \"Complicating Presence: Inter-Disciplinary Perspectives on a Theological Question.\" In [Divine Presence and Absence in Exilic and Post-Exilic Judaism](https://www.amazon.com/Presence-Absence-Post-Exilic-Forschungen-Testament/dp/3161524330)*.

            "It was in those final hours where his mortality was setting in and realized that the Lord was going to allow him to die on the cross so he may be reunited with God, but Jesus was still a man and man's ego is strong and this world is tempting.

This fact is not recorded in the Bible, I know.\n\nUntil that point in his life, although being human and limited in the way we are limited, he maintained a strong connection to God.  And then, as everything seemed to be crumbling around him, that connection suddenly disappeared.\n\nHow he reacted to being completely cut off from God is critical to his role as Messiah.  This is how Christ demonstrated the *way* back to God to us, the fallen, who are more or less constantly in such a state of separation from God.  \n\nHe didn't immediately give up and say, 'oh, i should have know that this was all an illusion.'  At the same time, he didn't deny his current state.  He felt abandoned and expressed this.  He didn't deny what he was going through, even though at that moment he couldn't fathom why it was necessary.  In other words, he showed us how to maintain faith when we are lost.\n\nFor anyone reading this who is actually Christian, I urge you to dwell on this; the exact way Christ reacted to being completely cut off from God.  It is more important than I can possibly convey in words.",

            "I kind of took it as, during His life and ministry Jesus was very in tune with God the Father, and Holy Spirit. Always isolating Himself to pray/commune with Him, praying before performing miracles etc. But on the cross, Jesus had taken upon Himself all sins and since God cannot be associated with sin, at that point in time, God wasn't with Him. \n\nAlso, in the Garden of Gethsemane we see Jesus ask God to spare Him from what was about to happen, even though He would still go through with it. It seems a very human thing to ask for right? So the \"Why have you forsaken Me?\" is another human response of Jesus to what He went through? \n\nSorry if its weird and doesn't make sense. \ud83d\ude36",
            "I think it acts as a reminder that he lived a human life. Was human. And had human fears. When faced with death, he felt true despair. Like we all would. This inherently makes what he did so loving. He faced that fear for all",
            "Who knows the reason Jesus would have given you, but the reason as I see it is that it was an example of bhakti, or devotional love to God. The point of bhakti is that the ego must exist in order to live in this world, so the bhakt chooses to keep the highest ego there is; that of a devotee of god. In this manner of living the devotee can go through many moods which may seem contrary to the ultimate truth, which in this instance was that Jesus's death was predestined and he knew all along what would happen. In many bhakti poems you can read of the author being upset with god or something along these lines. Obviously they know that there is no just cause to be mad at god for (as all life is his), but the energy in which they take upon this mood is a means of drawing themselves closer to god. The bhakt redirects all energy back to god. This is in contrast to other methods of attaining god, such as the jnana path. In the case of Jesus, the jnana method would be to discriminate between the truth and falsehood, and so he would see the predestination and necessity of his crucifixion and therefore be close to god in that way. Whereas the bhakt would instead choose to use the energy of his experience to be close to god. That could manifest in many ways but one of them would be to ask god why he has to go through such a trial. Just the mere thought of god is enough to draw you close, and a conversation even closer, closer still a conversation with intense emotion such as this utterance. It's all to be close to god. \n\nI do not know if attaining god was the reason Jesus said this, as in all likelihood Jesus was adept at both bhakti *and* jnana, and so therefore nothing would have had to be said at all. But it does make sense to view this as an example for his religion, which as we know, is a bhakti-focused one. Perhaps Jesus wanted his last words as a man to be that of bhakti, not jnana. After all, not many people can relate to accepting torture as predestination and necessity. Therefore, it is a better example to mankind to be in a state of bhakti in this scenario, so that everyone in the world can do or attempt to do the same in their trying times. Everyone needs their path. You would never see the Buddha saying something like this, and the reason is only that Buddha offered the world a very different path towards god than Jesus did. Buddha said all types of things that would have given calm acceptance on the cross context to his viewers, which was never a part of Jesus's teachings. What Jesus said made sense to his audience.",
            "Because at that moment he assumed the full weight of all the sin of the world and was cut off from the presence of God in a way that he was not able to even imagine prior to it actually happening. The physical pain of the crucifixion was nothing compared to the absolute spiritual desolation he experienced in those final moments.",

This helps reduce drag and keep it travelling in a smooth arc and maintain most of it's speed.\n\nA bullet shot straight up (only vertical velocity) will travel up until gravitational acceleration eventually slows it down. Then it will \nstop\" mid air and start falling downward. Since it \"stopped\" mid air, it is very likely to fall in a \"tumbling\" motion. A tumbling motion has much more drag and the bullet will have a much lower terminal velocity than if it were spinning.\n\nThis can still hurt quite a bit, but it's less likely to be lethal.\n\nA bullet fired at an angle will have both vertical *and* horizontal velocity. At it's max height, it will have lost all it's vertical velocity due to gravity, but it will have retained most of it's horizontal velocity because it's been spinning and minimizing drag. This bullet does a much more gradual turn back towards the ground and maintains much of it's spinning motion, which means it'll have less drag and a higher terminal velocity.

They traditionally were layered:\n\n- Headline: Just the absolute minimum gist of it.\n- Lead-in: A few pertinent details added, basically what you would today call a tl;dr.\n- text body: Here you get everything laid out, connections explained, numbers given etc.\n\nThe purpose of this was to facilitate fast information exposure to the reader: The headline would give a general sense of what had happened in one or two seconds, the lead-in would add some important details in five more, and if you really wanted to know more, you could dig into the main text.\n\nThis model is kind of obsolete nowadays, with head-lines having been repurposed to be attention-grabbers; They too often do nothing to inform you - they're designed to raise questions, to make you curious. It's why so many of them play the pronoun game (\"This is what big pharma does not want you to know!\" - What is \"this\"?, Why doesn't big pharma want me to know?): They don't inform, they purposely withhold info to draw your eye and keep you reading.\n\nThat may also partly be why tl;drs tend to be at the bottom: So you feel less inclined to stop reading once you get the gist of something - The people who wrote something put effort in it, they want their text read.",

            "A very common insurance payment structure:\n\n* Pay a monthly fee (called a \"premium\" and is usually from $50 to $2,000 depending on the type and number of people in the family) AND\n\n* Pay a set fee for common services like $25 for a doctor visit and another $20 medication AND\n\n* Pay a deductible from $500 to $5k (ish) depending on your plan) AND\n\n* Once you pay the deductible, you pay nothing or 10% or 20% of the cost of the service depending on your plan. Eg: pay $200 for a $2k MRI AND\n\n* Once you pay the deductible, there's a cap on the amount you pay for the year, not including the monthly premium. This is can be from $1k to $5k (usually). Eg: rack up $80k in bills, but you only pay $3k\n\n* Those numbers assume that you see only providers within the plan. See someone outside the plan and the prices go up. Eg, the percentage in network is 20%, then outside is 30% or 40%. \n\n* This is a typical structure for policies offered by large corporations. \n\n* There are several types of pre-tax savings accounts you can set up to use to pay for all of the above except premiums. \n\nIs it the biggest scam in the universe? Yes, yes it is.\n\n\nEdit: I'm begging Europeans to stop telling us how it cost you $25 to have brain surgery last year. We know.

            "My wife and I had insurance. After a difficult delivery which required transfusions and additional care, the insurance company refused to cover this as \"maternity costs\" and billed us $30,000. As a young couple, we nearly filed bankruptcy, but instead decided to drain our savings and cover the rest through family loans. It ruined us. Fuck American-style insurance. I hate it. We are a couple who did everything right and still got the shaft. \n \nEDITING TO ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS THAT HAVE COME UP: \n \nThe year was 2013. We had insurance, but did not carry \"maternity coverage\" which would have been an extra $600 or so per month and wouldn't even kick in until after a year of paying for it. We had tried getting pregnant before, and weren't even sure at this point that we could. We figured that if we finally got pregnant, we could handle the typical $8k or so for OB/GYN and delivery out of pocket with our savings. \n \nHowever, since there were complications, the costs ballooned into the 10's of thousands of dollars. $30k was the \"reduced\" bill after arguing/negotiating with the hospital billing department. I also placed angry phone calls with the insurance company; in my mind, these were not maternity costs, since the tough delivery would have literally killed either my wife or new child (or both) without modern medical intervention. Insurance basically told me to pound sand. \n \nWe were young (early-mid 20's) and had good savings for our age, but this completely wiped it out. I had a consultation with a bankruptcy lawyer, who advised me that bankruptcy was definitely NOT the right option for us. Again, we were young and checking all options here. I hope this clarifies a few things. \n \nInsurance laws in the US have changed since then, but still suck. \n \nThank you to those who offered support and condolences.",

            "I have cancer for the second time. Insurance is why I continue to stay at my corporate gig, despite other options. Even with great insurance, I get surprised by random costs. One day I\u2019ll show up to my doctor and owe nothing and the next day I\u2019ll show it to my doctor and owe $300. And when they tried to explain why this happened, it makes even less sense. Plus, insurance is still fighting a hospital bill from six months ago. Now, I paid my full out-of-pocket max on that hospital bill, but because they have yet to fully accept that bill, it does not apply to my account yet. So I\u2019m continuing to pay out of pocket even though I know I\u2019ve hit the max. The system is exhausting and ridiculous even in the best of times, and when you feel ill and not up to figuring out this crazy, it\u2019s 80 times worse.",

            "If you are unlucky enough to have medical problems that are chronic, like cancer, for example, how good your insurance coverage happens to be can easily be a matter of life or death. After being diagnosed with cancer, I needed chemo to shrink my tumors or they would take over my organs and I would die. Chemo was about $136k per treatment and I needed 18 treatments before the tumors were under control (to the extent that my cancer was undetectable, which it thankfully has been for 7 years). The nurses administering my bags of IV chemo were usually floored when I said \u201cthat bag of fluid you\u2019re holding costs $63k!\u201d\n\nI was very lucky that I had a very good job with a large software company at the time, and the exotic chemos were covered by insurance once i hit my out of pocket maximum for the year (obviously on the first dose of each of the 2 years my treatment spanned). Had they not happened to have been covered, the oncologists would not have given them to me. I still would have gotten \u201clife saving\u201d treatment and probably shittier chemos with much worse side effects that were less effective (but happened to be covered) but my outcome would have undoubtedly been much worse. \n\nI consider myself lucky that the ACA (\u201cObamacare\u201d) was passed a few years before my diagnosis as well, because it had two critical provisions that, if weren\u2019t enacted into law, would have probably led to my death. First was that coverage couldn\u2019t be excluded for pre-existing conditions (my company closed on being acquired the same day I was given my diagnosis, and the insurance from the acquiring company would very likely have tried to exclude cancer from coverage, calling it a pre-existing condition). Second, the ACA prevents coverage from having \u201clifetime maximums\u201d, which I would have hit about half way through the 1.5 years of chemo treatment.\n\nWhen republican dipshits talk about \u201cgetting rid of obamacare\u201d it immediately activates my fight or flight response and I seriously have to keep myself from punching them, because without that law I would have very likely been both bankrupt and dead. Of course, getting rid of pre-existing condition exclusions and lifetime maximums was only a first step, and it is obvious to any thinking and compassionate individual (however rare they are in the US) that more has to be done.",

            "We often don't, and are forced to have debt ruin our credit and be harassed for years by collection agencies",
            "For a large portion of Americans? We don't. Living on at-will employment, with no benefits, while paying an arm and a leg for cost of living makes paying down a one-time debt difficult at best. Eventually, the debt goes to collections, we get harassed by debt collectors for a few months, and depending on how legal the collection agency decides to be (they do TONS of illegal stuff) we may end up with the house repossessed, paying fees in court, or declaring bankruptcy. \n\n\n\nThat being said, the hospitals will deny this, but if your bill is less than the amount required for them to sue, they will most likely write off your debt. I don't pay ANYTHING until I get an itemized invoice for services rendered, because the hospital system regularly siphons huge amounts out of the insurance industry by over charging (think $90 for a bandaid). They would literally lose money taking you to court for less than what their debt collection agency charges for legal fees and recovery services. This varies hugely by state and hospital though because the US is not a unified country with a single, logical medical system; it is 53 countries and territories in a trench coat, cooperating only the absolute minimum amount to let us sit at the big kid's table at UN meetings. \n\n\n\n\nTo be clear, what I am describing is what happens when you just literally can't pay your debts and there's nothing left for them to take. It's not something done voluntarily by anyone in their right mind. It destroys your credit, makes it nearly impossible to get loans, and creates a level of paranoia that doesn't disappear just because the repo men abandoned their efforts for the weekend. It's way too common for poor people to have no choice in the face of spiraling debt *except* to avoid paying. Paying a debt down just isn't possible if you wind up unemployed, with your vehicle repossessed and your house in foreclosure. \n\n\nYes, the US is horrifying. Hope that helps.",

We paid for nothing from the first doctor visit to the delivery, and my son was covered for the first year of his life. My wife's coverage ended after her post-partum examinations.\n\nThis time around, I had a different job and the insurance was more affordable for family members, so I added her to my plan. We had to pay copays for exams. After the delivery, we received a bill for $13k. My insurance was hesitant to pay it because they wanted to know if my wife had any other coverage first. I missed a letter they had sent asking about this. When I called them, they resubmitted the claim and paid $11k of the bill.\n\nThe whole thing left quite a bad taste in my mouth. The prices don't seem to make sense, and the fact that they can be negotiable depending on who is paying them on your behalf, this company or that company or the government, just makes them appear all the more arbitrary.

Now, there are a lot of folks that can't get it for whatever reason, but the ACA was supposed to remove most of those.

No matter what you go through within a year-long span, after you spend $2500 on medical bills, insurance covers the rest. On top of that, some things are always covered.

            "Without health insurance that most of us can't afford? You go into debt, bankruptcy, or you commit suicide.",
            "Most of us don\u2019t get the massive hospital bills. It\u2019s a very small percentage of the population that are getting absolutely obliterated because they were unlucky enough to get sick or need medical care while not having good insurance.\n\nThat said the average bill is absurdly high, I got billed for $1500 for a 10 minute conversation where I told the doctor what medicine I needed them to write me a prescription for and then they did.",
            "Most people have health insurance (around 91%). The way that works is when someone gets a big medical bill, there's usually an \"up to\" amount you pay right away (deductible) and a maximum amount of money you can be asked to spend over the course of a year (out of pocket limit/maximum).  \n  &nbsp;  \nSo, short version, when you see someone get a bill for $40,000, they generally don't pay all of that on their own. You pay the deductible (say, $1,500) and the insurance company pays the remainder.  \n  &nbsp;  \nThis is all for services your health insurance covers. If it's something that isn't covered, it's likely your problem to negotiate with the care provider.",
            "You don't",
            "We don\u2019t. We are in debt up to our eyeballs and we spend our years paying it back while racking up more debt with little hope of a retirement plan to fall back on.",
            "If insurance covers it you are okay.\n\nBut the insurance corporations will do anything in their power to not pay for you. In America if you need a major medical procedure I suggest finding the most vicious lawyer you can afford to protect you from being overcharged.\n\nBut still medical costs can destroy you, getting charged 100s of thousands for procedures and services that should only cost hundreds of dollar.\n\nYou can sacrifice your credit score by dodging the collections on unpayable medical debt.\n\nBut I've seen it completely destroy people. Our system is the cruelest invention of humanity. Also our drugs cost 10 times more for no reason beyond infinite greed and cruelty.\n\nIf you don't want to follow us into this nightmare remember to vote and always vote against copratists.\n\nAnd if you can do something about Rupert Murdoch the whole world would be better.",
            "My mom had a life threatening tumor removed when she was in her 40's, she had no insurance at the time. The surgery cost close to a million dollars. Not including recovery time and chemo. She worked out a deal with the hospital, they said she could make whatever amount of monthly payments she could. She would do 50 monthy payments at times.",
            "I'm a lawyer with good health insurance. I also have a collection agency that calls me regularly for a $150 bill for x rays of my ankle in 2017.  Apparently the urgent care that I went to when I sprained my ankle on vacation (in Maine) billed the doctor's time and the use of the equipment for the x ray separately.  There may also have been an issue with one or both being out of my insurance network because I live in Massachusetts. I can't confirm the specifics because they refuse to send me an itemized bill that I could address with my insurance company. Insurance company said I would owe $7 or something.  Also, the urgent care's billing department doesn't have email and is open something like 4 hours a day. Years ago, I sent them a letter pointing out that it's illegal in both Maine (where they are) and Massachusetts (where I am) as well as federally, to try to collect debts while refusing to provide itemized bills. Never got a response and it's since been turned over to a debt collector so that's fun! I'm not paying it without an itemized bill, they're extremely unlikely to do anything about $150 and if they try to report it to the credit bureaus I'll contest it. If I had less stuff going on in my life I'd be seriously tempted to sue them, because, again, this shit is illegal but I'm busy so our standoff will likely just continue indefinitely.",
            "The whole system is hosed.  I'm currently working on a software system to submit claims to health insurers.  Let me just say it is one of the most inefficient processes I have ever seen.  Democrats have tried to get national healthcare in place for decades.  This whole mess can be totally hung on the Republicans.",
            "Insurance.  My employer offers insurance.  It's cheap.  I think I pay < $10k a year for it.  My kids birth didn't cost anything.  I can go to the ER and max out of pocket is $100 or I can go to UC and it'll be max $10.  \n\n\nThe majority of people in this country have great and affordable insurance plans.",
            "You're gonna get a lot of \"average redditor\" replies here with lots of doom-and-gloom, woe-is-me perspectives, but the reality is that most Americans are happy with the insurance they get through their employer.\n\nIf you have your shit together in life, a stable job with decent insurance, those insane hospital bills don't usually come up and are relatively rare. I had appendicitis a few years ago that got badly infected and required a 5-day hospital stay in a private room. The total bill at the end was $80,000, with my insurance picking up about $75,000 of it. The rest was my deductible, which I was able to pay out of pocket using my emergency funds.\n\nNot defending the American healthcare system as it's clearly shit no matter which party you support, but the explanation for how people can afford their hospital bills is pretty straightforward. The horror stories you read on reddit are people who had particularly bad experiences and want to vent about it. The people who went to the hospital and had a good experience with their insurance without any big surprises aren't going to complain about it online. The problem is that those horror story experiences are still far too common and lots of people without solid insurance (and even some with) genuinely get screwed by the byzantine complex of insurance and provider billing.",
            "Often, they don't and the bills get written off, if insurance did not cover them.",
            "Reddit is used by massively disproportionate age groups and to a point social and economic classes. The vast majority of Americans don\u2019t have the problems that you speak of, no matter how much people on Reddit cry. The healthcare system is flawed no doubt, but isn\u2019t what people want to make it out to be. People quote the price for shit, including people in this thread like they are actually paying that cost. \n\nIf you believe Reddit then everyone in the country much have millions in medical debt.",
            "We pay what we can and suffer for the rest of our lives. Like a mob boss extorting us for money till we die. \n\nWe declare bankruptcy.\n\nWe lose our homes.\n\nOur wages are garnished.\n\n*Most* bankruptcies are due to medical debt.\n\nPeople *kill* themselves over medical debt.\n\nIt\u2019s literally a fucking travesty. We have the worst healthcare system in the modern world.",
            "The honest truth is that they don't pay those bills as a rule.\n\nI was a medic for 20 some years, and I did billing for one small rural ambulance service. We got paid about 36% of the time for our services. The rest had to be written off as a loss. Now, we were \"owned\" by a small town of about 1200 people. \n\nThe city had a small tax base. Times got tough some years. I personally paid money out of my own pocket to put fuel in the ambulance a time or two . As did other people on the service."

I would have random adults talking to me about things even I didn't know about yet, or that I hadn't told my friends yet, or not get to share news with someone (ie grandparents) because they already knew.

            "My parents are not into pictures and wouldn\u2019t have been the type to live on social media, but my mom\u2019s family sure is. I still periodically have to check my (mostly dead, used only for marketplace) FB account to make sure my uncle hasn\u2019t posted some embarrassing photo I was forced to pose for as a kid. I\u2019m so glad there wasn\u2019t social media when I was in my teens and when I was getting married because my uncle and grandparents would specifically tell me they were taking the most embarrassing photos possible to show off when I got my first boyfriend.\n\nMost families aren\u2019t quite so malicious in their intentions (my family was not joking, they are very mean-spirited), but I look through my Instagram feed now and feel so sorry for some of the kids whose parents just don\u2019t seem to understand boundaries. The photos I see of kids are very rarely interesting or flattering, and I\u2019m sure that 7 year old doing really bad dance moves is going to be horribly embarrassed when her friends dig up and share that video when she\u2019s 15. I unfriended one parent after they posted a video of their kid on the toilet.\n\nThe thing that really gets to me, though, is that these seemingly mundane videos would make it very easy for a predator to groom a child by becoming unusually knowledgeable about their interests, their friends, their schedule, and other information that an adult wouldn\u2019t necessarily have easy access to. The principal of my school attempted to lure me into a bad situation as a kid, and was unsuccessful mostly because he made up a story about an event he thought would interest me that it turned out was something my dad and I did together. I got excited to bring my dad along and even mentioned it to him, and my dad fortunately realized what was going on and shut that down right away. If the principal had been able to research me at all on a typical social media account, he likely would have seen my dad in photos of this particular event and might have learned about another of my interests that might have tempted me to meet up with him without telling my parents.",
            "I\u2019m definitely glad about it. But I\u2019m also sad that there aren\u2019t many pictures of me as a kid that I could look back on now. No to social media but yes to taking pictures.",

Idk for clout but it would feel weird having all that documented just for social media \n\nPeople love adoption stories so, people would eat that up",
            "You\u2019re definitely not alone, but I also really dislike the aspect of antisocial behavior that it brings. More often than not I see parents scrolling through their phones at lets say the dinner table and it\u2019s sometimes even hard to talk to them because they\u2019re too focused on their phones, it\u2019s literally sickening to think how they can\u2019t even look up from their phones and talk to the people around them.",

            "This is why, as a parent, I'm very discerning about the things I post about my kids on social media. Nothing that they would find embarrassing years later. No naked or semi naked pics. No pics of tantrums or whining. And I keep my social media super locked down.\n\nAnd if years down the road one of my girls has issues with something I posted, I'll of course remove it immediately.",
            "The people who do it now would have been doing the same with a disposable camera most of the time. Before social media, we'd have to stop, take this picture ect. Only we'd get in rouble when she developed them and saw we'd blinked or whatever because it was one of only 24 pictures on that camera and she can never go and get a \"decent photo\" because my sister and I were distracted from pretending to be happy by actually having fun. \n\nOf course now with my nephews she's constantly telling him to pose so she can post it, but at least now since it's just a click and a bit of data accidentally having fun doesn't get him in trouble.",

Couldn't care less about social media to be honest, but my wife likes to make an Instagram post from time to time (not too many fortunately).\n\nYesterday was the first time she asked if she could post some baby pics on it, but I rather she doesn't. Let's see how long I can put it off haha.",
            "I'm SO grateful that my mom took a lot of pictures while I was growing up. they were for us and our family though, not for Facebook. I have relatives with kids that post every. single. day. diaries about what she's eaten that day, picture of her kid, diaries about her plans.

            "Aside from the food pictures, and I don\u2019t know how old you are, but my mom had an old film camera and still took pictures of everything she possible could when it came to us kids. Her mom was largely absent and they were poor, dad wasn\u2019t around at all, so she never had any pictures of herself as a kid.",
            "Are you kidding. My parents worked in advertising. I was a child model. And sometimes it was cool stuff like toys, but quite often it was the dapper Easter church clothes shit.\n\nFast forward to awkward tweens, and I was voluntold I'd be on a this Saturday morning kid's game show or another. I was in a couple of those \"don't do drugs kids!\" commercials.\n\nSo yeah. I was on full display in the 70s. It wasn't horrible.

            "I have very few photos/videos from my childhood because my parents didn't own a camera for much of my life. Of the ones we do have, half of them are terrible because you couldn't see the image and realise it was blurry and needed to be taken again. The ones we have are only from special occasions because people didn't just have a camera on hand to whip out at a moment's notice.\n\nSo no, I'm not unbelievably happy that my parents didn't put videos/pics of me on their social media when I was a kid. Because the kids *now* have records of their childhood that a lot of us older people don't have. Sure it's cheesy, but they have all these cute memories of day to day events that they can look back on as an adult and remember things that otherwise would have been lost to fading memory. I don't remember going out for ice cream or juice with my parents, but these kids can go \"oh! that's right! We used to go get juice after school every friday and chat about our week!\" when they see them.\n\nIf social media is what it takes to have a reason for taking photos, then so be it. Most kids i know love cameras and want to take photos/selfies all the time anyway.",

I miss when taking a picture was because that person wanted to remember a moment, not because they wanted likes from people they barely know.\n\nWe live in a society, amirite?\n\nThat being said, I agree with others that this sentiment is much better applied to posting stuff about underage children. It's best to keep that stuff on a private family facebook page or something.",

My mom didn\u2019t carry a camera around every day, but there was usually a camera with some film in it in the house. If something happened that was thought to be picture worthy, you would have to wait while someone went to get it. That didn\u2019t happen as often, but when it did it was worse than the few seconds it takes to pull out a phone to take a digital picture (worse in terms of wasting time or ruining the moment).\n\nBut my parents didn\u2019t take a picture of every ordinary thing or let it ruin the real life moment, and neither do I. There are definitely more opportunities for people to go overboard with their cameras, but not everyone does. I\u2019m fairly certain my parents wouldn\u2019t have been delaying everyone\u2019s meal so they could post a picture of their steak.\n\nEdit: Also, if my kids had their way, we would photograph and post a LOT more stuff.

It\u2019s like the digital version of \u201cI knew you when you were a baby\u201d, it\u2019s awkward, the picture of me was probably ugly and it wasn\u2019t done with my consent",

            "From some of the videos I've seen there is a clear difference between a funny cranky moment (kid denying they need a nap when they clearly need to)  funny lies or moments. Then there are videos of a kid having a bad day or a bad tantrum. So parents shove cameras in the kids faces and post the bad moment online. Those are the ones that bother me the most. It's fighting fire with fire. Small kids don't understand their emotions, and have a difficult time regulating them. Why post that? It seems to be a form of punishment, but the kid doesn't understand that. There's no direct consequences. Step up and be a parent talk to them, walk the kid through what's going on. If a punishment is needed do one that makes sense to them. That requires knowing you're kid and knowing what works. IMO recording those mean challenges, or posting a breakdown is abuse.",

Lots of embarrassing tagged photos that haunt me.\n\"Like come on Granny I don't want the kids at school to see what I got for Christmas.\" or even worse: vacation photos showing off my oddly shaped prepubescent body at the beach. \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude33\ud83d\udca8\n\nI really am going to try to respect my future child's privacy & not put every moment online for the world, like of course there should be no harm in uploading occasional cute photo to appease your relatives but I'm definitely not going to post bath time photos that's private & just so fucked up that some parents do that since there really are sick disgusting fucks out there who get off to nude baby pics. \ud83d\ude31\ud83e\udd2e",
            "Mine did, but after their divorce they were all deleted so they could date without people thinking they had kids (:",
            "I (27F) was pregnant twice this year (miscarried both times but that's another story) and I remember how pissed I felt when my mother-in-law began to harass me because I said the baby was not to be posted on her Facebook account. I had no problems with her taking pictures of the baby and showing her friends, but absolutely no online posts. She began bringing it up constantly, asking if I had changed my mind and begging me to reconsider.\n\nMy husband and I both do not have Facebook and never have. It got to the point that I considered making one so I would be able to see what she was doing because I didn't trust her at all. She's the type that speaks to an imaginary audience (hi guys! Just wanted to show you my breakfast today and wish you all a good day before I head of to get my hair done!) and gets like two likes but feels like an \"influencer.\" I could totally see her using a grandbaby in a similar way. \n\nI was shocked that a woman in her 50s was giving me such a headache about this.\n\nI wish this was something I didn't even have to think about. It's sad that so many kids are being promoted to strangers and privacy is not respected.",
            "The social media aspect sure...but I really wish we had digital media when I was a kid. My entire childhood is stored on VHS cassettes which idk are good anymore. They're unwieldy and I may not even have a functioning tape deck. Those memories might just be gone forever :/",
            "My mom just recently started doing this as of like 4 years ago?  I'm 24 now, but for ANY type of gathering pictures have to be taken for her Facebook.  I'm glad I didn't have to endure this during my childhood",
            "You're not. I'm glad because of this.   \n\n\nNot glad when your cousin's wife posts a picture of you on facebook without consent, though.",
            "yeah, you still have an album that they are gonna break out and show your kids..",
            "I mean they are doing that for the memory's sake. It's just the modern photo album and they might think the kids will want to see it someday. There's probably all sorts of moments from my childhood I (and my parents by now) have forgotten all about because there's no photo record of it anywhere (seeing how not everyone had a camera in their pocket 20 years ago).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHaving said that I was the kind of kid who had a lot of embarrassing meltdowns because I just couldn't handle much and took a lot of things too personally. My family still won't let me live down the moments they just still happen to remember. Imagine there being 20 times more material for them to pull from because they have photo and video recordings of it. Glad there's no tangible evidence for a lot of the things I did.",
            "I mean, my mother would take photos of my messy room and post it on social media for her friends to make fun of and stuff even though I was extremely suicidal at the time. Like she made my dad remove the door, and I still didn't clean. But apparently I was just gross and deliberately defying her. My dad would take photos from nature hikes and stuff so I wouldn't complain there. He's the better parent in my opinion.",
            "Not alone! I take great joy in clicking \u201cMemories\u201d in my Facebook app every morning and deleting 99% of whatever is there from the last 14 years. We just had a baby, and we have a very strict no social media policy for photos of her. I posted one photo of her in which her face is mostly covered several weeks after she was born to let people know she had arrived. I did not post the birthdate or her full name. That\u2019s all that will appear about her until she\u2019s in high school and decides for herself if she wants data about herself out there... after watching whatever the equivalent of The Social Dilemma is in 14-15 years.",

            "I\u2019d hate it for the bullying, sure. But my parents both died when I was still a kid in the 90s. We have a few photos but none of that regular day stuff which I think would\u2019ve been nice to have.",
            "If you ever have to ask the question \"Am I the only one\".. you're probably not. \n\nI think the oldest picture I have is around the year 2000.. but basically 0 prior to that. So anything back in the 90's, 80's, 70's.. I basically have 0 pictures of. \n\nAs someone who's about to hit 50yrs old.. I'd kill to have pictures/reminders of all the stuff I did back in the 90's or 80's. \n\nThat's one of my biggest and most frequent regrets.. is that all my memories of that time are fuzzy/gone.. and I have no pictures of any kind.",
            "In general I'm glad I didn't grow up with smartphones.\n\nI don't think I had one until College.\n\nThey're definitely good things that I have enjoyed from social media. And I know it's cliche to think that you grew up in a better time than the next gen.\n\nBut I really think that technology has become too dominating. And I'm glad that I grew up in a world where I was able to experience computers and the internet but it wasn't so critical to daily life that I needed it.\n\n\nAnd not just that but social media has created a world where people's happiness revolves around other people's responses to what they post. Instead of just enjoying the pictures that you take with your family and share with them.\n\nWe've been trained to seek approval that way and it's sad\n\nI work in Pediatrics and by in large the social skills of kids are pitifully bad. They don't know how to have a conversation. They don't know how to look you in the eye. It's because all theyve ever done is look at a screen\n\nWe try to emphasize with parents to limit screen time to the little ones especially but its a losing fight.",

            "I honestly never thought about that before, but you're right. Thank god I grew up in the late 90s early 00s before everyone thought to post baby pictures and videos on facebook.",
            "Yeah, same. I'm also happy that Facebook wasn't a thing until I was already in college so that I was limited to embarrassing myself on AIM and MySpace. Kids now are on so many different platforms posting things that will eventually cause them periodic microbursts of shame for life.",
            "you will never remember that day when you and mom went to Jamba juice if she didn't take that picture. If that picture is there that moment will always trigger a memory.\n\nI think you're just annoyed by other people's FB pictures.",
            "My parents decided it was a good idea to put my newborn medical history on Facebook. So there are still ways it can happen, but I totally agree.",
            "You\u2019re definitely not alone. I would never post pictures of my child online. Or myself for that matter.",
            "Its so annoying my parents go to places just so they can make photos and put on facebook not to mention my dad posts photos of me with him on his facebook when i tell him i dont wanna be on there",
            "Yes and no. There was a time when I thought \"Man I am glad none of the embarrassing things I did were recorded.\" but now that I have a kid of my own, I wonder what I was like at his age, and not just a picture at my birthday or Christmas, but regularly. My parents just didn't take pictures on a regular basis, and I don't remember it.\n\nSame thing with my teenage years, I came across some pictures I had taken with a disposable camera and love that I have them. \n\nI was in the Air Force from 2004-2008 and have 1 picture of me in uniform and doing my actual job. I really wish I had a lot more. I went to Guam while I was in and have like 5 or 6 pictures of myself from that time. People just didn't carry a high quality camera around with them all the time and I wish I had. \n\nTL;DR: Sometimes I wish they did.",

Talking shungite. Anyways, its a 2 billion year old like rock, stone that protects against frequencies and unwanted frequencies that may be traveling in the air. So thats my story. I bought a whole bunch of stuff, put them around the la casa. Little pyramids. Stuff like that.",
            "I'm 35 and my mom got a facebook account like 6 years ago and still constantly does this shit. It was always me taking the pictures because I had a high end phone and she had a shitty bottom of the barrel smartphone. Like 3 years ago I finally got her a Samsung Galaxy S7 so she couldn't complain that my camera was better....then she complained that she didn't know how to post them to facebook...\n\nMy brother has an 11 month old daughter now and my mom has ten million pictures of her, probably hundreds on facebook. I haven't been on there in years.",

            "I think its a type of person that does that. Neither of my parents would've been that person, maybe a few pictures after I was born and maybe some birthdays but thats it and I find that to be fine.\n\nI'm Facebook friends with parents who post their kid every. Single. Day. And its embarrassing pictures of them, way too much over sharing. I hide them from my feed",
            "As a parent, I'm keeping my kids off of social media until they're old enough to have their own and decide what to put on there and what not to. We've got a cloud album for family, but nothing on social media.",

            "This year number of photos of someone who is say 15 now is just staggering.  My nephew was born in 2009.  Digital cameras not phones were still the thing at that time for pictures.  I remember commenting that by his second birthday there were more pictures of him than there was of our entire extended family combined.",
            "CKY and jackass took off while I was in middle school and peaked as i entered my late teens. I'm so glad all our shenanigans are on VHS and not digital.",
            "Meh I wouldn\u2019t have cared that much. Most parents don\u2019t do what you are describing they only take pictures of their kids doing stuff without stopping them. Sure we notice way more the extra one but they are not the majority.",
            "Not alone. And I think a lot about that, if I will want to put pics or other stuff of my kids (if I ever have kids) online. \nPlus I always think how many of those instagram famous kids online are backed by parents trying to make money out of them and I ask myself how ethical is that. Anyway, not alone in the least.",
            "just made me feel old because when i was little every picture has to be special to not end the roll....and even that does not guarantee that the picture will be correct revealed. So to me it's not a question of be happy or not but just how things are those days.",
            "While I hated that my mom did this while my brother and me were growing up. I'd make her know it too, she never got a picture of me smiling because I just never wanted to be forced to take a picture. \n\nI'm thankful that she didn't have much social media friends that crossed into my real life. It was mostly family from back home and friends I'd either never met, or never took an interest in to care more about. \n\nI'd be more annoyed if my mom was friends with my friends mom's or even some of my friends straight up.",
            "You are not alone, but up until recently, I was one of those parents that did so. I have two kids (9F and 5F) and posted their photos on FB mostly so our family could see them. I had TONS of pictures on FB of both of my girls. A few months ago, I started thinking about their privacy as they got older, especially with my 9-year-old. So, I went through and deleted every album of their picture I had. I want my kids to be able to \"start fresh\" when they have a presence online. While I know that those pictures will never disappear from the internet, at least no can easily get to them now.\n\nI would advise all parents to really think about doing this as kids get older. I agree with OP - I am so happy my parents didn't have FB as I was growing up to put all my pictures online. While they may not think it is a big deal now, our kids will appreciate it as they get older.",
            "Absolutely not alone. When I see people on social media put their little kids on their feed I really wonder if they understand the depth of that decision. The internet is nooo place to put pictures of your little kids. Just isn\u2019t.",

            "You are literally the only person in a world full of 8 billion people to feel this way.",
            "So many laughed at me when I wouldn't get a Facebook, or any social media really. (Yes, reddit)  But I've never regretted it and when I read about others deleting their profiles, it just makes me feel a sense of relief for them.",
            "As a gen z-er my parents never did this kind of thing",
            "My son 10 year-old son said to me yesterday. \"Please don't take videos of me dancing, it just makes me not dance.\" I got the message.",
            "The obsessive Facebook pictures(like just at Jamba) would have been annoying yeah, but tbf my grandpa had one of those cameras that he\u2019d carry around and take pictures of us a lot. Tbf though while i was annoyed at the time now i have a lot of cute childhood pictures & he actually took a lot of candid ones that i didn\u2019t realize at the time. I\u2019m glad Facebook didn\u2019t exist though, cuz I\u2019d just feel weird about having them on the internet forever",
            "This is exactly why I\u2019ve chosen not to share any pictures of my son online. He can decide if/when anything gets posted when he\u2019s old enough.",
            "Nah, but when I got married my bride asked for some pictures of me growing up.   They stopped at around 7 and then it was just school pictures.  \n\nKinda hurt my feelings.\n\nEverything in moderation.",
            "Nope, I am 100% grateful for that. I was having a conversation about it the other day, in fact. My boyfriend\u2019s sister is constantly posting pictures and videos of her two year old. Videos that would probably be seen as embarrassing home movies to me as a kid. And sometimes the pictures have Snapchat filters on them, which I get some of them are cute, but they also slim your face and shit, which I hate to see on a BABY.",

            "I fucking hate the all the time photos of food, especially when there kids waiting to eat.\n\nA quick photo once in awhile cuz y'all went out for ice cream? Sure have fun. Took a snap of a particularly nice dinner out? Absolutely. \n\nAnd folks who are foodies,I totally understand you like to share. But let the kids eat! \n\n\nAND FOR THE LOVE IF GOD NOBODY WANTS TO SEE YOUR POTTY TRAINING PHOTOS WHY DO YOU EVEN HAVE THOSE COME ON NOBODY IS GONNA LOOK FONDLY BACK AT PHOTOS OF A KID TAKING A SHIT",
            "What I think is mean are all the video s where they deliberately set their own kids up to get scared, cry, whatever. Now that kid might get bullied in school ect. It's like modern parents are completely oblivious that the shit that went on in highschool in the 80s and 90s is now blown out to extreme proportions and students can't just leave the school to escape it anymore. Do they not realize that providing ammo to horrible teens (we all were get over it) is the worst thing you could do?\n\nI saw a video the other day on Reddit of a kid crying because he got Luxury Taxed out of a game of Monopoly. Like sure, cute for adults to watch, but what if his classmates see it? He's going to be called a pussy, a wuss, a *insert young dumb insult here*. As a kid that grew up heavily bullied because I was gay in a Catholic school, I worry how much worse it is for kids now and their parents just make it worse.\n\nAnytime I want to post a picture of my nephews I always ask my sister if it is okay with her and I always make sure it's nothing that could be considered embarrassing. Maybe a photo of us fishing together or something. But man, these parents posting other shit, gross.",

            "I completely feel this. Thank god I grew up before social media was a thing.",
            "That's what we do with our kid. All the day to day stuff gets sent to a private digital photo album so family can see and then just to update extended friends and family they see his monthly milestones. \n\nFor me and my wife, it's like I'm friends with you not your kid so your social media account shouldn't be your kid 24/7.",
            "I made a post on fb before i deleted my account about this. I basically said, \"if you post your children, your forever taking away their right to privacy.\" The response i got was very disappointing. \"Just because you don't like kids doesn't mean I'm going to stop!\" Was a common answer. \"Ijust HAVE to post everything my grand daughter send me about my great-granddaughter. Could you possibly do any different? \" (Includes nude photograph of infant) or \"i have to, most relatives won't see these photos if they aren't on Facebook.\"\n\nIll admit it, i Dont like children. I don't like seeing them on my feed. That personal bias doesn't make the reality any less surreal or dystopian. There is a public photographic log of this person's entire life that can never be deleted, and had been active since waaaaaaaaaaaay longer than they can consent.\n\nWorst example i saw was a woman who made a Facebook account for her as-of-yet-unborn fetus. \"First selfie\" was an ultrasound image, she was posting things like \"can't wait to be born and meet my awesome mom!\" It disgusted me",
            "My mom takes pictures of photos and posts them anyways. *sigh*",
            "Not necessarily with my parents specifically, but I'm really glad I was around 16 when social media showed up. Don't get me wrong, I still posted and was featured in a few pictures/videos that make me cringe today, but I can't imagine how much worst it would be if you started being on social media at like 8 years old.\n\nKids do a lot of embarrassing and stupid shit with their friends when they are growing up, and I can imagine myself cringing for the rest of my life if picture/video proof existed of most things I did at 12 years old.",
            "Everyone always talks about people taking 15 minutes to take pics of their food before eating it but I feel like this is almost a myth. Like, nobody actually does this.",

            "I refuse to put pics of my kid up online. My wife won\u2019t either. We regularly send out videos and pictures of them to our families and do weekly video chats so that everyone can see and interact with them, but I don\u2019t want my kids\u2019 info and faces online anywhere so that someone could possibly take advantage of them or just because my kids can\u2019t fully consent to something like that. \n\nYeah, fully glad my parents couldn\u2019t do it back then. I also don\u2019t think they would\u2019ve though. Probably where I get it from.",
            "Facebook really started to come around as a teen so theres definitely some undesirable pics and memories but on the plus side, I wasnt forced into taking a bunch of selfies with filters on and thinking that was normal like some of these young ass kids today.

            "No you're not alone. My childhood was my chance to try new things and looks, it was my chance to look like and probably act like a complete dick. If i had thought all my friends and family would have seen the cringey shit i got up to then i would have never done it and would have not become the person i am. Its not fair to have your life broadcast to the whole world, for their criticism or even their approval. I know i won't be doing it to my daughter",
            "I think it's almost borderline abuse.

The general idea that someone who has authority of me is potentially(likely) posting about how dumb i am, bugs me. \n\nThat being said, my family never took pictures at all growing up. Even to this day. There is probably under 10 pictures of me before I turned 18 in 2007. My dad is getting older, just hit 60!, and I have almost no pictures of us. I have a few from my wedding. While my childhood was full of abuse, I wish I could look back at pictures and imagine how things could have been.",
            "Not just that, but happy my friends couldn't torture me with pictures too. I was definitely that kid that peed myself on a roller coaster - I relive that enough in my dreams, I'm thankful I don't have to worry about photos popping up on the internet.",

            "Never had to deal with it. but yes I am glad it isn't a thing",
            "my 9 year old niece told my sister that she didn't want her pictures online, so that was enough for her.",
            "Nothing wrong with taking lots of photos of your kids.  I have tens of thousands of pictures of my kids.  They're all on the NAS so we can view them from our devices on the home network.\n\nNone have been posted on social media.\n\nI don't get parents that post their children's whole lives on the Internet.  You take pictures so you can remember them when they were little and reminisce.  You don't take pictures for bragging rights.  People need to grow the hell up.  Be secure in your adulthood, and stop seeking validation from strangers.",
            "My mom was really really into the candid photo thing. She would constantly be swarming around and family events trying to get candid photos. Constantly just in your face! And not everyone looks good in candid photos. When I was a teenager, I was a really ugly fucking duckling. I still have self esteem issues because of all those candid that she would spam Facebook with. She had a whole folder dedicated to me until one day i quietly went to her account and hid the folder. I\u2019m sure she kept posting to it, but it was no longer visible.",
            "I am wishing i had some more pictures or videos from where i was younger, but i am still glad they arent public. Actually, there are only like 2 or maybe 3 pictures at all on the internet of me, so no actual pictures even come up when you google me. I am glad that its that way.",
            "Just hopefully you becoem a meme like success kid",
            "I\u2019m so thankful I was raised before social media.",
            "I guess I'm in the minority that I wouldn't really care. Is that OK or is reddit going to crucify me?\n\nAlso how does taking pics take 15 min? You whip out your camera (or phone nowadays) and snap a shot. Takes like 2 seconds.\n\nI love taking pictures, I'm a visual person who doesn't have the best memory, and pictures of mundane family activities are very special to me (both of when I was was a kid, and of the kids I have now).\n\nSure, I think it's weird if people are explicitly taking these pics for ad revenue (which is true for some influencers and the like), but reddit seems to have a hate boner for the very idea of snapping pictures of your family. I don't get it.",
            "This say that your happy your mom did this. Did you mean unhappy? Thankfully I didn't have to deal with this. Just incessant video recording for my childhood/teen years",
            "If I have a kid they're going to be off the fucking grid until they go behind my back and get their own phone.",
            "My sister doesn't really post things of her son online. She says it's not fair for him to have a public digital trail before he's even aware of it.",
            "Nope your not  alone  dude my mom would all ways had to take a  photo or record  me every time my school held a special ceremony or a special event she had to do that if I was involved in some way or form lucky for me we would move around  a lot  and all the photos and videos  wind up getting loset or distorted",
            "I genuinely find those kind of accounts creepy.  It's one thing for your mom to snap a quick photo of you doing something cute of your own free will to send to your grandma, it's another to meticulously stage and document the daily lives of your children for the viewing pleasure of complete strangers.",
            "Screw my parents. I'm grateful my friends couldn't post anything",
            "My parents took nonstop photos and videos of me, my entire childhood is documented in albums and not digitized thankfully. We also have many home videos just for family purposes. Now as adults they still take photos of us but thankfully don\u2019t put them on Facebook, just sometimes a family group chat with extended family.",
            "A little late here but I agree! A girl I know posted a picture of her toddler covered in diarrhea. Like why would you even think to do something like that?",
            "I have two toddlers and never post pics of them on FB. I have a shared Google album with only a small circle of trusted friends and family that have the link. \n\nPeople think I'm crazy for not posting on FB, even if it only to my friends or I go through and select specific people. I just don't trust it and don't to put them on blast to the internet all the time.\n\nA neighbor of mine who is in her 70s, took a pic of my daughter during Halloween and posted it to her own FB page without asking me. When I found out about it, I asked her to take it down and she straight-up rolled her eyes at me and said \"fine.\" She also made a comment about how it has so many likes it's sad to take it down. Wtf?? That's not your kid and you do not have my permission to post pics of her on the internet!",
            "I still remember a phone conversation my mom was having with a friend sometimes in the mid-nineties. In the conversation, they laughed and laughed about how I didn't know that the underside of pots and pans needed to be washed at the same time as washing the inside. That was easily 25 years ago. Based on this, I can't imagine what she would've posted about me online.",
            "yah like\nive seen peeps post nude toddler pics and like\nyah most photo albums probably have those\nbut people online arent going to see them the same way amd it saddens me",
            "I mean there weren't social media apps when I was a kid but we still took pics that we cherish now, I don't think that's a problem, but posting them on social media definitely sucks.",
            "r/doesanybodyelse",
            "at the time i got annoyed but now i realize that it\u2019s a good thing",
            "Yes! More so I am glad there is no evidence of the dumb shit me and my friends did",
            "It\u2019s nice to not have to worry about online persona and I wish I could relish in that, but it\u2019s nice to have memories that will be up as long as the internet is.",
            "Why though... social media can serve as a great time capsule.\nI\u2019d actually be happy to have such a time capsule with photos of my first years... many of them got lost in time along with the memories that accompanied them.\n\nI mean, what\u2019s the worst outcome you can get from this? Being embarassed because you had a silly clothing as a kid 20 years ago? Bruh pls..",
            "My wife (40) and I (38) always talk about how good it is that we didn't have all those social networks and photo capabilities when we were teens...  \n\nThe stupid crap that I did when I was growing up is fine staying in my memory and the memory of my friends.",
            "Yes and no\n\nI don't have the best relationship with my mom and she's not exactly mom material either. I don't know if she still has my childhood photos or if she just straight up deleted them or she could have lost them through the years\n\nRegardless, I don't have them and I don't have access to them. The only childhood photos I have of myself are the ones my grandma posted of me when I finally taught her how to post pictures on Facebook, back in like 2008-2009\n\nSo like while I don't love the idea of sharing pics of kids online, I do wish I had access to the pictures of me that may still exist in the world",
            "I am often reminded how fortunate I am to have grown up after social media pervaded our lives for many reasons including this one.",
            "My mom likes to make her profile photo one of my profile photos for the whole month of my birthday and it\u2019s infuriating. I always report it lol."
