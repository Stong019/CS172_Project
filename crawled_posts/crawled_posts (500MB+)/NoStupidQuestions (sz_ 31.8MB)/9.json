I definitely enjoy it though. \n\nWe had a big storm last week during the work week and I was disappointed it wasn\u2019t on the weekend because I didn\u2019t want to feel guilty about not going for a bike ride to exercise. \n\nI\u2019m really happy I live somewhere where it\u2019s generally nice, and it\u2019s only infrequently that the weather is poor.

            "I enjoy it about once every 10 days,  definitely an excuse to not be very productive.  I am looking forward to one now since gyms are closed and I am making myself get out and get atleast 10k steps in.  I started wearing gloves and picking up trash today, great motivation it feels good to do something albeit not much.  Heavy heart for first responders and people living pay check to pay check.

            "I\u2019m sure someone does, but not me.",
            "to be honest, i prefer \"bad\" weather just because it's more cozy to me. rain is great, overcast days means less bright warm sun. cold, rainy days are my favorite. the smell during/after a rainy day make me feel so many positive emotions lol",
            "Some of us are working outside. To provide you your utilities. I hope you would wish for good weather the day your internet or power goes out.",

            "Oh my god YES YES one thousand times yes. However I have another reason for preferring bad/cloudy weather.\n\nI have warm lights (yellow tinted lights) in my farmhouse, and my favorite coffee shop has them too. When the weather is dark and grey, the yellow warm lights inside \"pop\" more, if that makes any sense.",
            "I work night shift for the same reason. All I enjoy doing is reading books and playing videos, plus I get paid 15% more for night shift. It\u2019s a win-win, especially with covid-19",
            "Many times on vacations when i need a break in between on one of the days",

            "It rains 2/3rds of the year here. Literally. So eventually you have to get up and do some shit outside, otherwise you'll be a fatass. So no, not really. On the other hand, it is hilarious when you see SoCal residents whining when the weather isn't absolutely ideal. I just wanna shake them and tell them to stop being such a pansy.",

            "Yes, exactly this right here.",
            "I definitely agree! Grew up in New England, then lived in Boston for 8 years. I moved from nearly year round shitty weather Boston to sunny beautiful clear skies all year South Carolina and realized that I never really understood how much worse it feels to feel any kind of bad/depressed/etc when the weather is gorgeous. It\u2019s like I can\u2019t even claim seasonal depression, because winter here is still sunny and temperate. Yet I used to spend 6-8 months dancing with \u201cseasonal depression\u201d in Boston. \n\nOn the bright side, I\u2019ve found it easier to pick myself up and do little things I wouldn\u2019t do in say, freezing or shitty weather down here when I feel down and slowly I\u2019ve gotten a better handle on regulation my emotions. Turns out I\u2019m actually a pretty happy person, I just spent many years in terrible weather that took a toll on my psyche.",

            "Best sleep of my life is when it's storming",
            "Yep, not only just now, but all the time actually. I'm way more productive in winter, because I always feel bad when the sun is shining and I got to work at home and I'm not biking, swimming, walking around or something. I always hope to do most of my summer work in cafes on my laptop. But now...",
            "This is how I feel about winter season.. Winter season is resting season. At summer it\u2019s full speed. I prefer summer tho when I can go out paddling rivers, go longboarding or go hiking and spend some lazy days camping in my van.",

            "honestly, sunny weather isn't my thing. when it's too bright out I just get super lazy and want to nap. When it's rainy/cloudy is when I am at my most productive",

            "I like rain because it makes the world feel small",

            "This is one of the biggest reasons I love my new life in Florida.",
            "Yes. This is part of the reason I love winter. The flip side is we have such short summer is where I am that I feel guilty spending day on the couch if it's nice out even if I really just need that day on the couch.",

            "I'm forced to live with parents right now and I prefer temps 4\u00b0 to 5\u00b0f cooler than them, so I prefer bad weather because bad weather means cloudy sky's which means less sun heating up the house.",

SAD hit me like a bitch this year and I'm so ready for it to be over.",
            "That's not really why, but I do prefer bad weather.\n\nFor me, it's because I like feeling all safe and snug in my house while outside it's really bad.

And also, because,  as Melville wrote, \"We felt very nice and snug, the more so since it was so chilly out-of-doors; indeed out of bed-clothes too, seeing that there was no fire in the room. The more so, I say, because truly to enjoy bodily warmth, some small part of you must be cold, for there is no quality in this world that is not what it is merely by contrast. Nothing exists in itself. If you flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable, and have been so a long time, then you cannot be said to be comfortable any more. But if, like Queequeg and me in the bed, the tip of your nose or the crown of your head be slightly chilled, why then, indeed, in the general consciousness you feel delightfully and unmistakably warm. For this reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire, which is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich. For the height of this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket between you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air. Then there you lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal.\"",

            "Hi all, UX designer here. This is a pretty well studied phenomenon in web design called \u201cbanner blindness\u201d. It is a learned behaviour to simply ignore ads and even ignore any content that looks like ads \u2013 even when its not an ad. \n\nIt\u2019s not just you, it quite simply most people that do this because we\u2019ve learned that the ads results usually don\u2019t correspond the best with what we actually want to find.\n\nYou can read more about this here: https://www.nngroup.com/articles/banner-blindness-old-and-new-findings/\n\nThe more you know etc.\n\nHave a good day.",

I won't click the ad because it's not affecting my decision to go to the website, and Lowe's shouldn't pay Google for a website visit I was going to go to anyway.  \n\nBut, if I'm just like \"hmm...

            "So this is actually a pretty big political debate in a lot of places. In my state I think it's called 'voluntary assisted dying', and can be accessed under very strict circumstances (not super familiar with the details, sorry!). One big issue with it is circumstances where a person may have trouble communicating or understanding. It's one thing to choose to put down a pet, when their entire life is managed by a human down to what they eat and what medical treatment they receive. It's different with a cancer patient who may very much want to live out their final weeks, but can't communicate",

He had completed various living will documents and made clear he wanted to pass if he was ever in his current condition (decreased quality of life/ unlikely to improve). He communicated to the dr that he wanted to be allowed to die. After a consult with phych and documeting that his current state was his new baseline (wasn't expected to further recover), they (hospital) agreed to allow him to pass, they stopped all treatment and support, and moved him to hospice care. He passed a week later after refusing all food and fluid, and being given pain meds only for comfort.\n\nAlthough it wasnt \"immediate\", it was legal with his consent.

            "There are issues with human euthenasia that aren't simple to deal with.\n\nFirstly, you require someone to kill a human - this is a big ask and many are not comfortable with the task.\n\nSecondly, it is possible to coerce people into it - want grandma's inheritance sooner rather than later? Convince her she's a burden!\n\nThirdly, people can change their minds. It is possible to put so much pressure on people to 'go through with it' that you interfere with their choice in a major way. The more hoops they've had to jump through to get to the point of euthenasia the more likely this is.\n\nThese are just three possibilities off the top of my head, there will be more.

He got to go with humility and on his own terns. In my mind, I keep hearing him say that he thought of my mother (his DIL) as an extra daughter and how proud he was of me.\n\nEuthanasia is humane. Dying dignified should be a human right everywhere.",
            "In the Netherlands it\u2019s legal BUT there are some rules to it. Children under 18 are only allowed when there is unbearable suffering and no hope for improvement. We had to go through the process with my sister when she had been deadly ill for 7 months at the age of 10-11 ( and the doctors would not listen to us, she had a tube from the stomach through which she was fed but her body had rejected it and all kinds of nasty tissues and inflammations had developed, when we had permission and the documents for euthanasia however they did listen and removed the tube expecting it not to be true but instead of a 1 hour \u2018inspection\u2019 surgery to see her stomach they did a 5 - 6 hour one to remove the tube and tissue ). \nAnd we were starting it last year when she had fallen terribly ill but were sadly too late. ( she suffocated before we were able to start the treatment and procedures ) \n\nEither the person has to be suffering terribly and be terribly ill and not get any better. ( prospect of dying a horrible and/or painfull death )\nOr they have to be an adult and make clear why they no longer want to live. ( terrible future health wise , bad health, very old with a bad health, cancer etc. ) \nYou have to be able to talk to the doctors and tell them you wish to die. There is a whole procedure and you have to be found to be right of mind and in your right to ask it. ( when you suffer dementia or other conditions that may cause you to not be able to speak or not be right of mind you probably will not be able to have euthanasia) \n\nThe debate about euthanasia is still ongoing though, just like the one about abortion. I think it\u2019s terrible we\u2019re more compassionate towards our animals than our own. The debate here, and the reason why it\u2019s still difficult to go through is because of religious reasons...\nThere is a huge group of christians, catholics and the likes who are against euthanasia because they believe their faith sees it as su\u00efcide or murder and you need to trust their sky spirit to determine when you die. Wether that be in a horrible way or not, you need to die from \u2018natural\u2019 causes the way their faith intends you to. The only other debate point is age, are old people who\u2019ve had a fulfilling life and don\u2019t want to die from bad health allowed to do so? Even when they\u2019re healthy now? What about people we can\u2019t help and \u2018fix\u2019 and who in the end will do it themselves anyway? \nBut the biggest part is still the religions their belief it isn\u2019t allowed. I know of two people who made the choice. Both young ( 34 and 50+ ) and both with an outlook of a horrible death. The youngest was \u2018helped\u2019 at the hospital and would\u2019ve suffocated. The older one had cancer for a second time, no prospects of it going away and a terrible health. They\u2019ve would\u2019ve deteriorated untill there was nothing left with a hell of a lot of pain. Their GP helped and arranged everything with them. \n\nIf we could\u2019ve had the choice my sister would\u2019ve had euthanasia too. It was what we preffered instead of suffocating with my father there helpless next to her. But sadly her body couldn\u2019t put up with it any longer. She died 15 minutes before they would have the conversation with her doctors and start treament. \n\nOn the other hand there is something you do need to realise. In many cases, like ours, if the patient can\u2019t speak any longer and the family needs to step in to decide. It\u2019s a lot harder to decide. I\u2019ve had to put down three guinea pigs and our family dog. All at a point there was no hope and their health was in such a bad shape it was the kindest thing to do. But those decisions are already hard as hell. The feeling afterwards: \u2018did they want it?\u2019 and \u2018was it right to do?\u2019 Are allready there with them. Let alone you need to decide over or with a family member, a human being. Yes, you don\u2019t want them to suffer and you don\u2019t want them to die a horrible death. But you still live with a feeling of: but is there no hope? No hope at all? And you need the right doctors and specialist around you to make that decision. You cannot turn it back. And you will need to live with it. But in my personal opinion it is the last kindness we can show someone. Wether they suffer physically or mentally and will never be able to live a good life and have a fulfilling life with quality of life, they should be able to decide to leave however they want. \n\nWe\u2019ve always had the state of mind that we would make the decision when time came. And her quality of life would be the measure by which we would decide. In the end we were too late, after 4 days of fighting for her life, no progress and her body getting tired. Seeing her deteriorate with no hope of a ( descent ) recovery. We knew what had to be done. And I would like my other family members to have the choice when time comes. I have a younger brother who is also disabled. We\u2019ve got a DNR for him as well and the same principle. When his quality of life might make life unbearable we would decide the same. It\u2019s a hard subject to talk about. But very important. Ans i think it should be a basic human right. We have no choice over where, when and how we are born. At least let us decide when enough is enough.",

We identify more strongly with each other, and don't want to see ourselves in that position or making that decision.\n* The Slippery Slope.  Once it's legal to kill a helpless person, it's possible to generate circumstances in which you can claim that someone was helpless, dying, and consenting even if they weren't.  Sure, it may not be easy or likely, but as long as you have to fight to the bitter end for every human life, this sort of murder cover-up isn't really possible.  A mysterious death of someone on life support is still suspicious if there aren't medical reasons for it.  Not to mention that, given a few decades and evolving economic conditions, and next thing you know you're euthanizing the disabled *without* their consent...\n* Humans are more valuable resources than animals.  Sad to say but true.  Civilization runs on human productivity.  Even an elderly, terminally ill invalid is a resource... to the hospital billing someone for their care if nothing else, economically speaking.\n* Consent is a tricky issue at the best of times.  In matters of life and death, whether someone is of sound mind to consent to such an action is very difficult to nail down, legally speaking.  The likelihood of significant legal ramifications becomes too high.  Someone's going to disagree and file suit, and your defense - that they consented - is difficult to mount.\n\nBesides, there are countries in the world that have overcome these issues and made consensual euthenasia legal.

I see it as a special type of capitalist cruelty that she\u2019s going to live an awful existence for her last years while the family takes care of her barely functional body all while paying terrible medical bills for the treatment to sustain her decrepit physical form.

In a world that favors eugenics, euthanasia is just a shortcut to culling the weak. Make their lives miserable and not worth living, and they\u2019ll consent. \n\nFuck that.

If a patient who was completely mentally sound had months upon months to consider the weight of such an option like Euthanasia, like in the case of some serious terminal illness, that\u2019s a different question. I\u2019m reminded that dreadful story in the news of an elderly Dutch woman who upon making remarks about wanting to die, the doctor had her coffee drugged with a sedative, and when she awoke during the euthanasia had to be restrained for it to be carried out despite her resistance. I can\u2019t by any means speak for any particular patient or know what they\u2019re going through, but someone wanting an escape from incredible discomfort or pain doesn\u2019t guarantee they seriously are wanting a real mortal end. It gets to a touchy grey area where if we\u2019re right, than we\u2019re saving consenting people from unnecessary pain.

            "I work in vet med, and this is something we talk about frequently. I've had family members who have passed away after terminal illnesses, and every time, they were horrific experiences. To see someone you love and cherish suffer so profoundly for so long, to linger and slowly wither painfully, day after day, their body an enemy that just won't give up, but they're so ready to be done.\n\n There was nothing more horrible to me than to see them suffer and not be able to do anything. In vet med, when we can't fix it, and we can't provide good quality of life, then we provide a peaceful and humane death so they don't have to suffer. It is an honor and a privilege to be able to help support my clients and to be there for my patients to prevent the kind of suffering I know they would go through otherwise. But then there was nothing to be done except watch and wait and pray for it to end when it was my own family. \n\nSo I think the option should be available. And if the day ever comes that I get a terminal diagnosis, well, I'll make my own arrangements and when the time is right, I'll take care of it.",

The concern is a misuse. There are plenty of people that point to the terminally ill patient being barely alive who wants to die.  This is the same as the case for the death penalty use for a serial child molester and murderer. Neither case seems problematic.\n\nBut in the case of the death penalty, it quickly gets misused by prosecutors. In the case of euthenasia, will you see people guilt grandma into dying so that she doesn't spend any more of her estate? Would death save more money than a nursing home for an Alzheimer's patient? \n\nThere is just a general fear of misuse by the relatives, rather than a desire for suffering. As more countries do it and people see that death-for-money isn't a real issue, it will likely be acceptable.",
            "[deleted]",
            "Euthanasia is legal in some places but let's talk about why it's generally controversial even if that's the case.\n\nSimply, animals are not the equivalent of humans.\n\nAnimals don't have reason and they don't understand what's happening to them when they are in pain or when they have cancer. All they know is that they are hurting.\n\nThey don't have any ability to  reason about the value of life. The value of another day living.\n\nI'm a dog lover and it had to put down many dogs but I will never put an animal on the same level as a human being such that humanity.\n\nSo when you've got say a dog that's in a lot of pain at  13 years old and needs chemo.. all the that dog is going to know is that it's suffering. It's not going to understand that it's life is being prolonged and it's not going to ascertain any value in that.\n\nBut human beings we do have reason. Some would say a \"soul\". We understand the value of another day seeing our loved ones. We understand and can reason regarding difficult things that are happening to us.\n\nThe taking of a human life for this reason is a far different. Human life is a sacred thing to most.\n\nBut let me point out a more practical and frankly more useful argument. If euthanasia is okay for people with let's say end-stage cancer.\n\nThat person may feel hopeless and they may not want to try any further treatments. The argument that we should allow them to make the decision they want to make with that hopelessness. Well first of all, deciding what is and isnt hopeless isnt always simple. But lets say it is.\n\nBut there are two primary problems. Number one somebody else has to do the euthanasia which means you are asking another human being to take a life. Or at least be complicit in providing the drugs that would take a life. Thats a huge moral question.\n\nBut also, by the same logic we should be allowing people who are suicidal to kill themselves. They also feel hopeless and they also don't want any further treatment and yet we don't let them kill themselves.\n\nOr what about parents who feel that their child cancer is too far Advanced. Are we going to allow the parent to end their child's life?\n\nYou see in my opinion the problem with allowing euthanasia for certain extreme situations is that it is invariably and inevitably going to open the door for wider and wider reasons to do this.\n\nSo to sum it all up the two primary problems are that number one you are asking somebody else to be complicit in or to directly take your life. In other words you're asking somebody else to do the Dirty Work by providing the poison or doing the deed. And to many that is a violation of the sanctity of life in itself.\n\nAnd allowing for certain situations where this happens can open the door for wider and wider allowances.\n\nI understand that some people have very strong views on this and I certainly am willing to admit my bias in that I am not in favor of any form of medical euthanasia. I believe in the sanctity of life and that it should not be ours to decide to take, exception being the death penalty which is a completely different situation.",
            "The same reason that people will fight abortion tooth and nail but then not give a shit about that life once it's alive.

            "A lot of medical professionals would not agree to carry out euthanasia because most got into healthcare for different reasons and ethically effectively killing someone doesn't align with strong held beliefs that we're here to save people, improve their life chances and in the end provide compassionate end of life care.",
            "Because of the web of laws around healthcare and inheritance, some people are in a position to gain / save hundreds of thousands of dollars if they could force someone entrusted to their care to submit to euthanasia. That's what makes it complicated.",
            "One reason is that we haven't parsed out enough of the ethical issues.  We're getting there.\n\nIn Oregon, the last time I checked (and if I'm not current, I hope Oregonians will correct me), physician-assisted suicide was legal under certain circumstances.  There must be a terminal illness or other incurable condition; the person must be within 6 months of likely death; and their quality of life must be substantially reduced by pain or hardship.\n\nThe person must demonstrate that they are possessed of judicial capacity, attest to not being coerced or driven to this by financial need, and are not seeking this out of despair or wish to harm themselves.  \n\nThere are waiting periods at every stage to allow cooling off.  Only recently did the Guv permit doctors to request an abbreviated process if the person was likely to die before the process was complete.\n\nOne problem area is profound neurocognitive decline (dementia), where all the factors are there, sometimes including extreme pain, but the person has no ability to consent.  I would recommend everyone complete an ADVANCE DIRECTIVE, POLST, or MHAD.\n\nYour question is good.  It appalled me to learn that PAS was illegal, and the extent to which religion is codified in law, but I understand mistrust of a doctor who acted as a \"final friend\" without protective legal boundaries in place.  Making it legal allowed doctors to participate without fear of legal retribution or losing their licenses.  Times have changed enough to give more control to patients.  \n\n(Hard to believe, but doctors used to have the power to withhold information from terminally ill patients.  Not that long ago, the doc might consult with the family and decide not to burden the dying person with the truth.)",

I also can't believe how much it is to deliver a baby, when it's practically free in NZ.\n\nHigher education is very expensive, very easy to get into student loan debt spiral, as opposed to no interest student loans that we had back home.\n\nTax rate is good though, iirc it was about half (percentage wise) to what I paid in NZ. But if you tack on the extra costs for insurance and other government assistance, it works out to be about the same.\n\nGas and fun cars are so freaking cheap. Wide open roads make for great roadtrips.\n\nThe suburban lifestyle we see on TV or movies is actually pretty accurate. Two car garage, backyard, front lawn, home owner's association etc. Houses aren't cheap but it's at least affordable compared to Auckland.\n\nSo yea, if you are healthy and not poor, it's a great place to be.

It depends where you go. Some states/cities are more open minded and what not because of more diversity while some are not and close minded people get scared and mean when they something is different to them.",

We have had racist laws in the past. Since then (60plus years ago) there have been great efforts to provide equity and equality. Have bad police officers and we have normal police officers. Normal doesn't make news.\n\nSchool shootings are a rarity. Again news that is reactionary sells. They suck that it happens. \n\nMajority of people have health insurance through work.

The metro area has a population of 2.5 million. It\u2019s also 65% Hispanic population, the largest Hispanic majority city in the country.**\n\n* I haven\u2019t ever seen a civilian open-carrying a gun around in public. That\u2019s allowed in Texas. People just don\u2019t it.\n\n* I have great healthcare coverage from my job, not from my government (I make slightly over the median salary for the city).\n\n* Local city police here are a mixed bag, but mostly good. A few cases of corruption and misconduct sprinkled here and there. From my perspective it\u2019s not systematically racist or rotten at its core. They seem to work in conjunction with the city most of the time.\n\nAll in all, no. The USA isn\u2019t even close to being as bad as Reddit makes it out to be. I can say that with confidence even knowing my experience is better than a lot of people\u2019s. It\u2019s just a huge place with 300M people. So anything bad that happens is put in the spotlight and made to seem like the norm across the whole country.",
            "I'm an Australian living in the US so tend to see the place with an outsiders eyes.  It is all those things but the weird part is none of it effects you, until it effects you and they certainly don't have an effect if you have money.   I live in a town with a huge divide between the wealthy and the poor and it's two different worlds in a town of 30K people.    There is a poorer part full of violence, no benefits with their jobs like so no health insurance that are feeling the effects of racism and then the rich white folk that seem to live in a bubble where absolutely none of it touches them.      And yeah if you're rich and white, America is pretty great.   And rich isn't that rich, honestly in my  part of the Midwest $75k a year or more and you're just living in a whole different world.   A lot of those insulated by money do not realise how very different the country looks to those without.     Is it as bad as it sounds on reddit?  The answer can best be summed up as it depends on how much money you make.   And how much money you make depends on a whole lot of factors you can't control.",

            "I love the American stereotype \" 'MERICA! FUCK YEAH! I'M GONNA EAT BURGERS WHILE TRAINING MY 4 YEAR OLD HOW TO FIRE AN M16!\". It makes me laugh every time I see stuff like that. It's not even close to representing all Americans though. It represents rednecks a bit better, but still. I don't want to own a gun, I don't trust myself with the responsibility of owning one. Many, many other people I know also don't own guns and don't want to even though we all live in a state where I could literally just walk to a gun store and buy a gun today.\n\nAs far as shootings go I don't have numbers but I've always believed that it's the media blowing things out of proportion. There's a constant battle between one group wanting everyone to believe that guns are evil and should be banned completely and another group that wants everyone to believe that if everyone had a gun there would be less gun violence. So they're constantly trying to shove propaganda in your face to sway you one way or the other.\n\nHealthcare here is absolute shit though. I hate the fact that I'm terrified that some day I might need real medical attention and get billed with a debt I'll never be able to repay. \n\nThe work environment here sucks as well. I keep hearing about how other countries get months of vacation every year. The company I just started working for gave me 1 week when I was hired and will give me three to use next year and a lot of friends and family have told me they're jealous that I get that much that quickly. My uncle is about to die of brain cancer and apparently he's not close enough family for me to get a single day of berevement leave. Everyone seems to expect you to become a workaholic that takes all the overtime you can get and goes above and beyond for that tiny raise or maybe a promotion in 3 more years.\n\nHow it compares to other countries? I don't entirely know, seeing as I've never left American soil. But it seems that lots of people want to immigrate here so there must be some reason they think it's better than their home country.",
            "I am not American, but you have to keep this in mind:\n\nAmerica is THE country that stands for capitalism and individualism, it is the country that represents economic liberalism and it is economically very right wing / very liberal \n\nMost large subreddits on reddit are filled with leftists, socialdemocrats or similar minded people who are against liberalism and are in favor of planned economies. People who are right leaning are also often banned by very left leaning mods who like to push their own opinions and ban contrary ones. \n\nSo it is more than logical for them to demonize the countries known for right wing economics and to glorify left leaning countries as the paradise on earth, because it helps enforce their own views.",
            "No, I\u2019ve lived in 22 other countries, USA is the Taj Mahal compared to all of them.",
            "Nah",
            "I'll cover your examples to give you an idea:\n\n(1) ridiculously expensive Healthcare\n\nThis is probably the most prevalent issue for the largest portion of the population. Insurance is expensive, and varies widely in quality. The government programs are really shit, so the private sector controls what kind of insurance the middle class has. I am on pretty good insurance, but my first thought every time I consider going to the doctor, even if it's something like a bad cut that needs stitches or an orthopedic problem that causes significant lost of function, is how much this is going to cost and how long it will take to pay off that debt.\n\n(2) School shootings every day\n\nThis is overstated. They are certainly more common than in the rest of the developed world, but actual shootings are still rare and you have a VERY low chance of ever encountering one. However, I did not attend school in some crime-ridden area with low-quality schools, and through K-12 I can recall at least 3 school shooting threats, 2 bomb threats, and a potential race war. None of these actually materialized. The only deaths of classmates involved drugs/accidents.\n\n(3) racist policies\n\nThis varies widely based on where you are. States like Alabama and Mississippi have remaining policies that have a racial impact, but truthfully I don't think this has that much to do with most people there being racist. I think it is really a matter of classism, and the reason that it disproportionately affects people of color is that they have less intergenerational wealth due to a long history of oppression. Racism is still prevelant in the generations that contributed much to the past oppression, and those are the generations controlling the senate unfortunately, but the vast majority of Americans are not racist."

            "1) There's nowhere to meet people organically. Nobody hangs out at the mall anymore, and things like arcades don't really exist. Coffee shops are filled with remote workers using it as their personal work space, and bars and clubs play their music so loud that, even if I did meet somebody there, I couldn't spit the game I don't have anyway.\n\n2) Online dating is a nightmare. If you're not extremely attractive, you're fighting a losing battle, and you can't fall back on having a great personality because the whole thing is extremely impersonal. And even if you are attractive, there are so many people that just use these apps for validation and don't actually have any intention of meeting up in real life. And even if you do somehow find someone that you vibe with and get them to agree to meet up, it's upsettingly normal these days, in all kinds of social contexts, for people to just not show up to an agreed upon meetup, and then act like they owe you no explanation for why they decided to both not show up and not tell you that they decided to not show up.\n\n3) Millennials and gen z have been priced out of things that were normal adult milestones for previous generations. Most of my friend group in our late 20s and early 30s either never moved out of our parent's houses, or moved back in with them during the pandemic, and those of us that aren't living with our parents are either working multiple jobs or living with multiple roommates to afford it. None of those scenarios are particularly conducive to bringing a romantic interest home.\n\nSo unless you happen to be a reasonably attractive person, with a job that doesn't pay you dirt wages, and a friend whose girlfriend has a single friend that thinks you're cute, you're kind of SOL. And in the face of all of that, a lot of us are realizing that being single isn't so bad and in a lot of ways is less stressful, so we fill our time with hobbies and hanging out with our platonic friends.",
            "I\u2019ve been teaching high school for 2 decades. The number of kids dating is very low compared to 20 years ago. For the first 10 years or so, there would be students canoodling/making out in the hallways. I\u2019m happy to report I don\u2019t have to see that anymore, haha. It\u2019s really unusual to even see high schoolers even holding hands. \n\nIt takes a lot of effort to get kids to talk to each other in class. They walk in to the room from the passing period and continue to be on their phones. I can\u2019t even say they are texting (talking to each other), but just mindlessly scrolling. Teaching has become exhausting for so many reasons, but the amount of effort teachers make to draw students out, talk, be present, and ask questions, engage in any meaningful way rivals staging a Broadway production. It doesn\u2019t surprise me that kids aren\u2019t connecting, let alone dating, because the default setting is to just not talk to anyone.",

            "This is just my theory, but it seems to me that the internet has provided so much access to a diverse range of content and interests that common ground is harder to find.\n\nWhen I was younger, we all watched the same tv shows and played the same games. Now there are tens of thousands of content creators, shows, games, and subcultures available to us that even if you meet someone who likes the same things as you in general, the chances of you sharing much common ground are slim.\n\nI remember a time when playing games was something you could bond over, and the chances of overlap in games you'd played was high. Nowadays even if you both game, the chances are that one of you plays 5 different first person shooters while the other only plays farming sims. Maybe you both watch anime? Back in the 90s/2000s this basically meant watching Dragon Ball Z and Avatar TLA, or maybe Naruto. But now there's a good chance one of you only watches Shonen anime discussed by a particular YouTube channel, while the other exclusively watches anime from a particular studio. This of course applies to any number of things, from superficial interests like fashion, down to core philosophical beliefs. High schoolers are even discriminating against each other for having an Android phone instead of an iPhone and vice versa, or so I'm told.\n\nThe curse we're currently suffering from is one of overabundance and ease of access, which creates so much room for differences of opinion that it's harder to find common ground outside of those you developed your interests with in the first place.",

IRL there's nowhere to meet people; everyone is either a) with a group and just hanging with them, or b) alone and not wanting to be bothered. You can't go to bars or clubs really either to date, that's almost exclusively hookups and the loud music/drinks doesn't facilitate conversation at all.\n\nOnline dating is actually dystopian as hell as well, you've gotta have like a PR team perfect your every appearance. That inevitably leads to every single profile being an inaccurate representation of the person of course. One message, a couple pictures, and a couple quotes stolen off the internet, thats what amounts to a first impression online and there's no way to project a genuine personality through that. Years of chasing perfection online also means that, if you're just a normal dude with a normal profile, you're going to be egregiously disgusting compared to all the picturesque profiles that have literal money shoveled into making them as \"right swipable\" as possible. When tinder first came out I used it a bit, I remember when I deleted the app I had over 200 matches from less than a month or so. This last week I have gotten.... 0 matches, and a hundred ads telling me that, not only will these apps not show my profile to others unless I pay them, but they also prevent me from seeing profiles that like *me* unless I pay them. \n\nI'm not gonna lie, I don't see a way where I will ever date another person for my entire life under this system. I'm probably just going to give up and live my life entirely alone because of this, and I'm sure so many other people experiencing the same thing are coming to the same conclusion; \"you're priced out of romance, everyone online has professional photos and impersonal manufactured profiles, people only swipe on those they think will elevate their social status, **you will never date anyone no matter how hard you try, dating isn't made for you**.\"",

            "I know a lot of folks are talking about CPS, but I wanted to throw in some advice on reading. I was an elementary reading teacher for many years. I also worked with older elementary kids who struggled with reading. The thing that got the fastest and most effective results for the kids I worked with was finding something they were really interested in and reading with them about it. For example, I had one kid who was a die-hard Trekkie. I bought him several books that went into the Star Trek lore and schematics of the ships and space stations. He would sit and pour over those for the hours with me and his parents told me he kept reading at home. I would help by reading aloud with him, sliding my finger under the words as I read - never telling him it was for his benefit. I let him think that's just how I read. Over the course of a few months, his reading improved significantly. I'm not going to tell you he was ready to read War and Peace, but he was able to get through basic texts with minimal assistance.\n\nYou're in a really tough spot and I applaud you for recognizing how important reading is and wanting to help your brother. Find something he loves, find a text on it (book, magazine, printed webpage - whatever) and tell him you want to show him something cool and just start reading, pointing as you go. Maybe find things regularly and do this. It can be five minutes or as long as you can keep him focused.  This absolutely won't solve everything, but it will help to bring him to a basic level of literacy and it might help him to become interested in reading.\n\nGood luck and let us know how things go!\n\n\nEdit:\nThanks for all the kind words, additional great ideas, and awards! What a great community!! I'm a Texan too and really appreciated all the Hank the Cowdog comments! \n\nAlso, I was today years old when I learned it was, \"pore\", not, \"pour\"!",

            "Please know that getting CPS involved does not mean your family will be torn apart and you shouldn't feel guilty. When I was a kid we had a caseworker at one point and it was no big deal, he just stopped in a couple times to make sure no one was harming us and it was all over after a few weeks. \n\nAs an adult, I had a mandatory reporter contact CPS because I had lost my home post-divorce and was living out of my car with my toddler. It was the scariest experience of my life, until I actually met the caseworker and she was super nice. She asked what my plan was and gave me advice on options I had. I moved into a new house with my son a couple weeks later and never saw her again. As a parent, it was a real splash of cold water in my face and really motivated me to take action and get my bearings as quickly as possible, and I'm actually grateful to have had the experience.\n\nOnly speaking anecdotally, unless your parents are actively abusing their children then it's highly unlikely that any serious action will be taken. Most likely, your parents will be spooked into getting your brother the support he needs.",

Your parents are almost certainly neglecting his educational needs to the point of abuse and this should be addressed, with CPS if necessary. This is also not what unschooling is about, either, so that seems like an excuse on their part. If you attend public school you can start by talking to a school counselor or even teacher.",

            "Is unschool like a free range thing, the theory that a kid is inquisitive and will learn tons of stuff every single day all by themselves?  Are you still under 18?  Did you go through this?  Have you just sat down and read with him?  Do your parents react to that?",

            "Ok, loads of people have addressed the neglect side of the issue, but after reading through all the comments I think I only saw one person even begin to touch on the fact he might have a learning disability. That is what I came here to address. I have a learning disability too and it wasn\u2019t diagnosed until *college*. OP, if your brother has health insurance, I\u2019d recommend you take him to the doctor for an evaluation. My children went through those (it\u2019s a four hour appointment where they test language, math, response times, puzzle-solving, etc)... Both of my kids have ADHD and 1 is autistic. Even though your brother isn\u2019t in public school, knowing about any learning disabilities or difficulties can help him to access resources as he grows, and things like dyslexia can impact things other than reading! Also-You said he loves audiobooks, and he uses text to speech programs \u2014 that\u2019s actually really great to hear! If he has a learning disability, his familiarity with these tools is going to help him a lot as he gets older. And if he *doesn\u2019t* have a disability, you can use these things as motivation to help him want to learn to read. There are loads of books that aren\u2019t available as audiobooks; you could try first bringing this up with him, & asking if he\u2019s come across any that interest him... if he has, buy the book for him & then read it with him, combined with some practise of phonics. (This is how I practise Spanish: I buy books in Spanish and them read them aloud to myself. I keep a dictionary near myself while I read, to look up what I don\u2019t understand. It\u2019s slow going, but it makes the language stick, and keeps me interested.)  -Also, I don\u2019t know if you have Dollar Generals (chain store) there in Texas, but here in Iowa, they offer adult literacy programs for the community. A couple of people also suggested the public library\u2014these are also a good resource! Lastly, OP, thank you for wanting to help your brother. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re not on speaking terms with your parents but it\u2019s obvious you love your brother very much, and that\u2019s so good to see. I hope that my reply helps you - both of you guys.",

            "I agree with all the other posts regarding getting proper protective authorities involved, so I'll address this from the building literacy standpoint instead. \n\nFirst, make sure HE wants to learn. Motivation will be huge, and if he's motivated, his skills will grow much faster than if he sees reading as a burden.\n\nSecond, get him started memorizing sight words (super common words that are typically taught through memorization as opposed to phonics). The Dolch Sight Word lists are commonly used and easily Googled. \n\nThird, as he's building automaticity with sight words, look up \"high-interest, low-readability\" materials. Since teen and adult readers are typically turned off by reading books for children, these books are more accessible and feature more grown-up situations (while still being appropriately leveled for developing readers). \n\nFinally, consider reaching out to any local colleges (especially those that feature teacher preparation programs). Universities often feature low or no-cost tutoring programs, and even if this isn't something your parents would permit, you might be able to get in touch with someone to offer you even more targeted advice or access to materials. \n\nBest of luck. Good on you for addressing such an important need for your brother!",

            "Years ago I worked as an aide in a high school in California that got students from lower schools that allowed kids to \u201clearn what they wanted to learn\u201d at their own pace, and would forward them on to the next grade regardless of what they had learned. It was the 1970s, when such ideas were not that unusual. Among my \u201clearning disabled\u201d (really just neglected) students was a senior who literally could not read at all. I taught him to recognize danger signs like \u201cpoison\u201d etc. I asked him what his plans were after high school and he said he was going on welfare, like his parents. Another student could read just a little, and I created a one-on-one class to teach her with movies and very simple books. The \u201cfinal exam\u201d I gave her was to write her own name and address. Out of the whole high school population fewer than a dozen went on to college. I hope things changed after I left. Side note: This was the high school where some of the Green Day musicians went to school a few years later, in Crockett. \n\nAs for how to help the brother, I wonder if OP can try to teach him. It can be so rewarding to help someone overcome illiteracy, and there should be lots of things online to help them get going.

This is all assuming that he doesn't have a learning disability, and that this is something that he would like to learn for himself. Consider looking at a scale or curriculum for literacy development. These are typically used in early years classrooms/care centers, but they can tell you at what level of literacy development he is at, and what the next steps can be.

We're talking about a 13 year old who cannot use facebook, who cannot text friends, who cannot play any video game I can think of. This is certainly not the typical case. Most unschooled children discover quickly that all the things they want to do require literacy, and are motivated to learn.",

Your local public library has lots of beginner readers and may have a collection of high interest but low reading level books. Look for books that would be very interesting to him. If he likes Star Wars there are books available at every reading level. He might like graphic novels.

I started him with Bob books and it didn\u2019t take him long to catch up.

            "I think people are confusing unschooling with homeschooling. Home schooling is teaching at home with some flexibility. Unschooling is a totally different philosophy. It basically let's the kids set the standards without any goals. I feel homeschooling should be regulated to some extent in terms of basic maths, science and reading and writing, some basic information about geography, history, civics etc should be expected. A twice a year visit and check by school district should be mandatory. Kids can be a bit behind say a year or two in grades to accommodate flexible pace of studies.",
            "My fianc\u00e9's family are very similar. Her parents homeschooled their youngest from birth to 12 and the 2 eldest have been in and out of school from a young age. It's the 'unschooling' part that confuses me - from what I've seen it appears to be an excuse to not bother teaching the kids for a year at a time.\n\n\nMy experience and advice:\nIf the parents aren't interested then they probably don't want your advice either but there are a few things you can probably do without causing major issues, and slowly you can bring your parents on board.\n\n\nFirstly, we got the younger one involved in Magic the Gathering cards. There's a lot of strategy involved so they can begin to think about technical problems, lots of maths that seems simple but requires deep thinking, and an awful lot of reading! If he's into dragons and elves and all things magical then it's a good thing to try.\n\nGames where you create stories are good fun and open up a child's mind to writing. There are several where you place cards down in a random order and make a story from the cards as they come out. If you take the time to write down some of the ideas they had, then you can expand on them later on with your brother. Let him lead the story and watch you write. He might end up taking the pen from you after a while.\n\nMy fiance signed them up to some home education groups which offee chances to 'play' but you'll find a lot of the other children are very creative and, while sometimes shy, will include new comers. It may take some time to find the right groups but keep looking, our local one runs sports clubs once a week as well as Spanish classes, pottery classes, etc.. and they're all inexpensive. Talk to some of the parents there and ask for advice, they are generally lovely people who have a lot of great tips (if they have reading groups then, in our experience, they don't mind including people of any ability).\n\nWith reading luckily it's something that can be caught up with in a couple of years. The youngest couldn't read at all at 10 and now, nearly 3 years later, he's reading a book every couple of weeks and is writing his own novel about superheroes - Marvel movies are a great source of inspiration to him.\n\nOne last bit of advice, acting classes have been a great help in making him more confident. He's only been going for 6 months or so but is a completely different child now. They can be expensive but ask about discounts or scholarships. Might be something to discuss in a years time once things have progressed.\n\n\nDon't get downhearted too much if things don't go your way when you talk about this with your family. They may not want to hear it and may shut you down. Just keep plugging away and do things off your own back if they refuse to help. It's tough, but you'll feel great when things begin to work out and your parents will hopefully see him progressing and asking for things himself and realise you've been a good influence.\n\nIf you need anything, just message me. I'll be happy to advise and can put you in touch with the girl who makes the magic happen. She's done far me for her brothers than I have and will gladly help if she can (signing her up for this without telling her - bad bad future husband!).",

Only elementary school teachers focus on teaching students how to read. Middle and high school teachers focus on comprehension.\n\nElementary teachers catch students by 3rd grade, otherwise they're behind for life.

I know that sounds counterintuitive since he can't read now, but there are ways you can encourage him to read. He won't learn unless he actually practices. Use multiple methods. Read to him. Have him read to you. Introduce him to audio books. Sign up for [Epic](https://www.getepic.com/sign-in). (Epic is great because he can look at the words while it reads to him!) Go to the library.

        "selftext": "My brother died in a work accident. His drilling rig hit a 12,250-volt overhead power line.\n\nAnyway, would it hurt to die that way? \n\nHe was working the controls, standing on the back of the truck when the arm of the drill hit the power line. Witnesses saw the truck burst in flames, and the fire department wasn\u2019t able to make it to the truck for over an hour. \n\nI wanted to know if it was instant? Would it hurt? Did he burn alive? \n\nI told my mom that it was instantaneous and he didn\u2019t even know what happened, but reading online I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true. \n\nI\u2019m crying right now, it just sucks and I miss him terribly. \n\nEdit: For those asking, this accident happened last May. The emotions are raw and fresh again because Easter is coming up and we had all made plans to go to the mountains, last year during that time.\n\nI had cancelled the plans last minute and a few days later the accident happened.\n\nWith it coming up again, I just keep thinking why did I cancel? We could have had one last day with him but we didn\u2019t. I want to go up this year, in his memory but I don\u2019t know if I can. \n\nEdit 2: Thank you everyone for the kind words and thoughts and answers. \n\nI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d get this many responses, I honestly just randomly wrote this question trying to help myself with the new grief and pain I was feeling in the moment. \n\nTruly, thank you everyone for taking the time to answer and respond.\n\nMy little brother\u2019s name is Joseph. He was 24 years old, and I think of him every single day. ",

            "Two things about electricity: it travels at almost the speed of light, and communication from the body to the brain is done with electricity. When he was electrocuted, his brain was overwhelmed by an electrical response from the power line that was much stronger than the body can emit to tell the brain it is feeling pain. Such a high voltage striking a person would disrupt these systems permanently, at least until he died. He was likely brain dead seconds after being electrocuted. Which means he felt no pain despite burning as he would have died from the electricity far before the fire killed him. People aren\u2019t just saying it was instant to make you feel better, it really was. ",

            "First of all, I am very sorry for your loss, and want to offer you my condolences. \nI hope you and your family will make it through this difficult time. \n\nTo answer your question:\nIf he was killed by the electricity, which I think is very likely, his heart stopped immediately.\nTherefore, he most probably didn't suffer and was instantly dead.\n",

            "I realize lightning can be stronger than this power line, but I imagine once you get above a certain threshold, its relatively the same.\n\nAnyway, my aunt was hit by lightning when I was a kid. She didnt remember any of it. She was taking shelter from a storm that blew in while she was at a beach, and it hit her through the shelter somehow. (I think it was basically like, a pole barn with no sides)\n\nShe said she didnt feel anything at all. She was talking to her friends, and the next thing she knew she woke up in a hospital. \n\nBeing that your brother passed, he probably took a stronger hit than her, but I would imagine that like her, he went unconscious before he even knew something was wrong.",
            "I'm so sorry. \n\nOne thing to remember is that signals in the brain are carried electrically. We all have a small amount generated in our bodies, it's what allows synapses in our brain, signals from our eyes and skin and tastebuds, and even heartbeats to occur. And if something stops the normal flow of signals, the brain doesn't operate.\n\nIt's the current, the wattage, that determines the deadliness of an electric shock. [In the case of that power line, he'd have received dozens of Amps.](https://wattstoamps.com/12250-watts-to-amps) Death is possible at a fraction of an Amp (70mA, or 0.07A), a whole more likely between 1 and 5 Amps, and as a person approaches 10A it becomes nigh-on certain.\n\n>\"The damage caused by electric shock depends on the current flowing through the body -- 1 mA can be felt; 5 mA is painful. Above 15 mA, a person loses muscle control, and 70 mA can be fatal.\" - Zitzewitz, Paul W., Neff, Robert F. Merrill Physics, Principles and Problems. New York: Glencoe McGraw-Hill, 1995.\n\nHow quick and merciful was it. So fast it struck before he had reaction time to notice. It wiped his mind before he saw anything, before he heard anything, before messages from his body could reach the brain. He was dead the instant the circuit was made between him and the equipment. His brain had no way of registering any pain. An odd way to look at it, but his end was as merciful as the situation was horrible. ",

            "My father had something similar happen to one of his coworkers. They were digging a trench near a metro line and hit a live high voltage line with the boom of one of the excavators. The guy that was closest to the boom evidently served as an arc point for the electricity, it all but vaporized him. When they conducted the investigation and watched over the cameras near the site, they concluded that he didnt even know that it had happened. He was just living and then not.

That\u2019s something that is surprisingly rare and I say that from experience and hours of safety investigation briefings. There\u2019s far too many variables and far too much science to assume his cause of death but I can say without doubt that he would of not felt any pain at all. \n\nI truly am so sorry for your loss.

It was only a period of maybe 15 seconds in the rain before my helper realized what was happening and kicked me.  I can tell you that while I was aware of what was happening, it didn't hurt.

            "Couple things, I am a lineman and work with primary voltage daily. \n\nWhen contact occurs with equipment sitting on the ground (cranes, drills, pumps ect) the path will travel the shortest path to ground, which would be outriggers, anchors, even people if a person was in contact with the equipment and the ground at the same time. That is why we lineman wear dielectric boots, it essentially creates no path to ground through our feet. \nYou stated your brother was standing on the equipment when it contacted the electric. If he had his whole body on the equipment even while the structure was electrified, he would be safe, for the time being. Think bird on a wire, or the guys that are getting out of a helicopter and jumping on live transmission voltage lines (69Kv+).  They are fine due to no difference of potential. \nIf he tried to climb off the equipment while energized, that would create a difference of potential, and would essentially lose control of there body and go unconscious. \nUnfortunately, you stated he was on the platform, which tells me he got caught in the fire.",

What kills or mames a lot of people is the fire. That being said the explosion that happens around a electrical arc usually knocks people out, I have heard it compared to a hand grenade going off right in front of you. The fire then kills you while your unconscious and unable to help yourself. Also high voltage AC electricity generally has so much power that if you get caught in between it and where it wants to go, it will blow the body apart and cook any living tissue in between. It also can cause your muscles to contract to the point of bones breaking. Hopefully the explosion knocked him out first. The only way to get some idea of what happened would be to know how far they found him from the drill rig.  \nIt may not be pretty but that is truth about what electricity can do to you.",

I just never knew it because no one told me and because I never put metal in a microwave before, so I never found out for myself (thankfully). When I was accidentally about to microwave a metal plate, I was questioned why the hell I would do that, and I said its because I didn't know because no one told me. They were surprised, because they thought this was supposed to be common knowledge.\n\nWell, it can't be common knowledge if you aren't taught it in the first place. Looking back now, as someone who is about to live by himself, I was wondering what are some other \"common knowledge\" tips that everyone should know so that they can prevent life-threatening accidents.\n\nEdit: Maybe I was a little too specific with the phrase \"common knowledge\". Like, I know not to put a candle next to curtains, because they would obviously catch on fire. But things like not mixing bleach with ammonia (which are in many cleaning products, apparently), a person would not know unless they were told or if they have some knowledge in chemistry.",

            "This probably won't save your life, but not knowing could cause lifelong pain.\n\n**Breathe in before you sneeze.**\n\nIt may sound obvious. It may sound intuitive. But no one I've encountered has ever taken the time to explain why it's so important to have air in your lungs before you sneeze. So one day, I was telling a joke, and running out of breath, and felt a sneeze coming, and decided I could spend the last of my air on nailing the punchline then worry about the sneeze. Right as I had expelled the last of my breath, the sneeze decided it couldn't wait.\n\nWhen you sneeze, your muscles try to quickly, forcefully constrict your lungs to push the air out of them. This happens even when there's no air to squeeze out. For me, that meant dislocating two rib heads. Since that day, about 15 years ago, I have had pain related to that injury, sometimes so bad I can't sleep.\n\nNow, admittedly, I was a young adult and dumb, and trying not to cause a scene around my friends, so I didn't tend to the injury right away. As it worked out, I didn't actually get the ribs reset for almost 2 weeks, during which I moved from one state to another. All of that absolutely exacerbated my pain and contributed to why it became a lifelong injury. Treating injuries seriously is important, but people will tell you that part.\n\nPlease, don't make my mistake. Air is easy to get, put some in your lungs before you sneeze.\n\nEdit: To save my inbox from months of the same question, **I don't remember the joke anymore**. It was a timing dependent joke, getting the punchline just right was part of the humor, which is why I prioritized the joke. Most likely it was a long-winded pun of some sort, as that's the kind of joke I'd tell a lot back then.",

Clockwise is to tighten, counter-clockwise is to loosen.\n\nEdit: \n\n11. Wet a towel and put it next to the cutting board when chopping onions (paper or fabric it doesn\u2019t matter). The vapor that causes tears from onions are attracted to water/moist things, which in most cases, the nearest moist environment would be your eyes.\n\nEdit again: \n\n* Of course goggles work for chopping onions because you\u2019re preventing the onion vapors from reaching your eyes. I just wanted to give a simpler solution with something you may already have in the kitchen, aka a hand towel. \n\n* Yes I know what righty-tighty lefty loosey is. But it\u2019s not inherently obvious that it means [\u201cturn right from the top\u201d = tighten] when [\u201cturning right on the bottom\u201d = loosen] is a thing too. The phrase to remember how to open jars and bottles is to help children remember, but they can also easily confuse whether the direction means turning from the top or bottom.

Secondly: Flowing water can be deceptively strong, and underwater currents are not easily visible. Also, drowning people can be more silent than you think. Generally be careful in and around water bodies.\n\nEDIT: It took me a while to think of some important ones: Grapefruit juice makes many kinds of medicine ineffective. Familiarize yourself with the symptoms of meningitis, sunstroke, hypothermia, strokes and heart attacks - they're not like the movies, and heart attack symptoms are different for women, and proper early detection and action can help significantly or even 100% save a life.\n\nSome that aren't very widely applicable: 1. Don't nitrate (apply nitric acid to) organic materials like paper or cotton - it makes explosives. 2. The most common fertilizer, ammonium nitrate, is also explosive under certain easy to achieve conditions. Store it carefully. 3. If you don't want your bottles of chemicals slowly and undetectably transforming into explosives, also avoid mixing acetone and peroxides. 4. Hypoxia (lack of oxygen) turns you drunk and feebleminded before turning you unconscious, so it's hard to impossible to properly detect and react to it. Hard to get into a situation where low oxygen is relevant _and_ you have a way to stop it though, unless you're a pilot, climber or diver, and in those cases you get trained. 5. If you're stopped by a train in a train intersection and in a hurry and it has passed and now you're eager to start going forward, keep in mind that another train could be coming the other way, masked visually and aurally by the first. 6. Snowblindness is a thing. Snow is pretty reflective, including invisible UV light. On a sunny cloudless day treat snow like the sun, if a bit weaker - don't look at it directly for too long.",
