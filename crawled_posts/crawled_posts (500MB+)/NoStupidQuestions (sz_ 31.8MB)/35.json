            "If you search up \u201ccops fired\u201d all but 1 of the articles are about her and her husband. The articles highlight her specifically. Like, \u201cTennessee cops, including married female officer, fired after repeated wild sex romps\u201d So I don\u2019t exactly blame Reddit themselves all to much. But yeah it is kinda weird they chose to only write stories about her.\n\nedit: the insults and hate towards her is absolutely horrible, just saying how I can see how most of it would be focused on her considering she is the most relevant when talking about the story itself.",
            "For those out of the loop, 5 cops were fired and 3 were suspended for doing sexual stuff while on the clock. (Sources: [one](https://torontosun.com/news/weird/tennessee-cops-fired-after-wild-sex-romps-with-female-officer), [two](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/01/11/la-vergne-tn-police-sex-scandal/11034860002/) )\n\nAs for why the woman involved is getting the most attention, it's likely because she is the common factor.\n\n(Not that it's important, but there's some misleading understandings about the marriage thing. She's actually in an open marriage. Some articles phrase it as if this was done without her husband's knowledge. Also, the department is of 60 people, and is now down by over 10%.)",

            "There are at least four elements in play. \n\nShe is the central figure in the situation, so naturally stories and posts focus on her and reactions to her actions. The one-to-many relationship in a small network/cohort is what makes it atypical and therefore noticeable (hestiant to use 'newsworthy', but it's along those lines of selling newspapers).  \n\nThe second element is rooted in sociocultural norms and expectations. These are far from universal, but it'd be disingenuous to suggest they don't exist. Why the double standard exists, its genesis and other factors are worth discussing, but not whether they exist. Those drove a lot of the framing of stories and responses. \n\nThe third element, misogyny, plays a substantial (but not necessarily sole) role in leading to those norms and expectations, and drives a lot of commentary/reaction to it. Note that someone  can arguably harbor the mentioned sociocultural beliefs (which can be characterized as misogynistic) without necessarily being inherently misogynistic themselves. \n\nLastly, the fourth element is that it's a high-profile profession with its own set of norms and expectations (both internal and external). If this were a group of dentists or accountants, the story likely would not have gotten much traction. But it's a group that is supposed to represent following and maintaining rules. Whether this was an internal gambling ring or some other coordinated ostensibly illicit (or at least promise-breaking) activity, that it was a group of police doing it draws attention. That this was an ostensibly lascivious activity increases this element.   \n\nNone of these are mutually exclusive and not all are necessarily present in each story/post.",

            "Couple tricks I use:\n1. Getting a really intense workout like lifting weights to muscle failure will get you some of the best sleep of your life (alternatively just bump out like 20 push-ups or whatever you can do right before bed)\n2. Doing whatever exercise you do closer to bed time helps as well\n3. If you are really having trouble lay on the floor for 10 minutes. It sounds weird but especially if you have a wood floor your bed is so much warmer and more comfortable that you will want to fall asleep instantly \n4. Similar to 3 but less extreme you can lay in a really stupid position like with your feet and arms in the air, it has the same effect",

            "Recently (a few months ago), I, who is now 21, found a really comfy position. Belly down, facing right, left leg straight, right leg 90\u00b0, left arm by my torso, right arm around the blanket that I made into a ball, and head not on a pillow. I say, this is really comfy for me, and I'm fully aware of the happiness I gain from this position. This is the first position I assume right after turning the lights off. The second position is nearly perpendicular torso on my right, both legs at 90\u00b0, both arms cuddling with the blanket that I made into a ball, and head on a (medium-hard) pillow because my neck rises up now and my head tilts because of my shoulder. The third position is back flat on bed, legs straight, arms crossed on chest, and the ball-blanket now is fully wrapped around my body. The final position I assume looks like I'm a mummy. That's it. I keep repeating these three positions and alter them slightly every now and then to adjust for comfort level. I wish I had a girlfriend to cuddle with while sleeping though. I compensate that with a blanket for now :(",
            "When we were kids our brains were much calmer but as we grow up we have constant thoughts running in the background of the head. So the best way is to calm ourself with deep breathing or listening to something soothing so you\u2019re focused on calling yourself.",
            "When I was like 4 I vividly remember sitting on my bed, back against the wall, pulling the covers up to my ears and tucking it all around me and I fell asleep sitting up. I remember being so fucking comfortable I still think of it fondly. So to answer your question, yes.",
            "I read down a little bit and I didn't see anyone address this, but I believe a major issue is weight. When you were a kid, you weighed a fraction of what you weigh now(and if you're overweight like me, it's even worse). Less weight means less gravity means less pressure, which I think equates to more comfort. Pressure is what all the high end mattresses attempt to address(used to work for Mattress Firm and did a lot of training on this stuff).\n\nWhen you go to shop for a mattress in person, take at least 10 minutes to lay in the position you normally sleep in and see if you start to feel pressure. If you're a side sleeper it still probably be in your shoulders and hips, back sleeper likely lower back and neck, stomach sleeper good luck to you, you're on your own.\n\nAlso, know that softer beds will always feel better initially, when you first flop down on it, but if you take a while to get to sleep or wake up often, you're going to want something a little firmer. Honestly, everyone sleeps better on firmer mattresses, but manufacturers are banking that most people will buy some fluffy crap that feels good for a while then turn around and buy a different one when it starts to fail. Most people also think softer means less pressure but that's not true, softer material collapses under your weight and creates more pressure over time it seems.\n\nLastly, a lot of people have mentioned pillows. Good pillows are almost more important than the mattress for some people. For me, I sleep on my side and if the pillow I'm using is even slightly too thick or too thin, my neck will hurt in the morning. A firm, but correctly sized pillow is key for me.\n\nGood luck!",

            "So I actually work for a Furniture company and I never thought about it before I worked there, but you should really get fit for a mattress AND a pillow. Most people think they can sleep on anything, which you can; but to truly get into REM sleep you need to be fitted for whats best for your body. I wouldn't listen to people who say \"Purple is great! Casper is the way to go! Just buy a serta!\" Or something along those lines. Go into a legit furniture store and have a professional fit you for a mattress and pillow. But don't let them just sell you \"Top of the line\" cause \"Its great for everyone\". I've been doing this for 4 years now and sometimes a $2000+ mattress isn't the best choice for someone. A lot of the time I can find the perfect mattress for someone at about $600-$800 with pillow. \n\nTL:DR - Find a professional who will fit you for a Mattress and pillow designed for your body. Don't just listen to people suggesting mattresses, actually get fit for one, it doesn't even have to be expensive!",

And even then, it was excruciating. But what made it worse is that while I was asleep, I was returning to my desired curled into a ball position, which meant I was really tearing those injured muscles and I'd wake up paralyzed and screaming.",

Laying on your side with your knees pulled slightly up and your arms bent, your pillow should hold your neck + spine in a neutral position. So nothing huge or super flat. Also, try being aware of your spine position as you sleep. Rotate your hips until your spine is straight and comfortable. Be aware of the rotation of joints and the following effect on the spine with the goal being keeping the spine straight (from side to side). A pillow between the knees helps some people feel more natural with the knees in this position.   \n     The second part of this is learning to self soothe. Every night in a chance to practice inner calm and meditation. Most important is breathing. Count four in, hold for seven, breathe out for eight. Focus your mind on the breath. If you get light headed, extend the holding and exhale portion of the breath. This shouldn't be a long drawn out process that you stop looking forward to. This is something you do from two minutes to an hour, it's as long as you enjoy the experience. It's a time to allow your mind to calm. Simply focus on the breath.",

Just stopping at the right time can let you last much longer than the time you spend resting. If you're not just thrusting as fast as you can like you're going for quicky, 30 min is a very reasonable time to reach with just mini pauses in between.

            "Depends on what your partner wants. Some people don't like penetrative sex at all. As long as you take care of what your partner wants in the moment, it's not a big deal if you cum early. It's only bad if you cum and then don't take care of your partner after.\n\nImo I think you should switch things up a few times with some oral/hand stuff in that time BC penetration for extended periods of time with no breaks can be boring for everyone involved, plus it gives you time to regain some stamina if you get me.\n\nTl;dr: the name \"foreplay\" incorrectly implies its only a preamble to penetrative sex.

            "You don't need to last that long if you're engaging in good foreplay. You want to get a girl to the brink before any penetration happens, and then have sex. Otherwise it's not very fun for the girl. \n\nSometimes you won't be able to make her finish first, so you just gotta finish the job after and she'll be happy. Or if you aren't really feeling it anymore sometimes, encourage her to finish herself and help her out, kiss her, touch her, make her feel really sexy. \n\nFinishing during sex is far from the most important part of sex, and women just want to feel like their enjoyment matters to their partner. How long it lasts doesn't matter as long as both of you enjoy yourselves. \n\nMy partner doesn't last a very long amount of time, maybe about 5-10 minutes max most of the time. I'm on antidepressants so I also take longer to finish. But I honestly have never cared, and I've never enjoyed sex more because I'm deeply in love with my partner. \n\nI love when he finishes quickly because it makes me feel sexy and powerful, and I don't really have a problem taking control and finishing myself afterwards if I need to.

            "I'm 40 and have been with 50+ women and it differs for each experience. I've popped in 3 mins before and I've lasted +3 hours before. The equation as it relates to me is: the more comfortable I am with the girl = the longer I can last. \n\nForeplay is a huge contributing factor and can be the difference between an amazing experience and a shitty one. You should use foreplay to learn your partner's body, and be sure to communicate each others do's and don'ts to make the experience as pleasurable as possible for everyone involved. COMMUNICATION is key! DO NOT get your (s)expectations from porn! \n\nIf you finish before her, be a gentleman and do what's needed to make sure she gets there too. Everyone should cross the finish line. In fact, if I'm \"dancing\" with someone I love, I'll go down during foreplay and MAKE SURE she has her *little death* before we even get to the main event... personally, I like for her to *get there* more than once anyway.\n\nBottom line: Every experience is different and each partner unique. Lasting longer doesn't always equal a more pleasurable sexy time. If she crosses the finish line, how long you lasted probably matters more to you than it does to her. 5 minutes or 5 hours... it's really more about the experience than the time spent. If you communicate well, everyone will have fun and be happy. \n\nStay safe",

How long you last is based on your sensitivity, how linked your orgasm is to physical or mental stimulation, what your sexual needs are, your fitness and how fast you get tired and how much getting tired affects your erection or pleasure, your stress level and how much stress affects your sexual performance. \n\nThere are a million factors. I find the more attracted to someone I am and the more fun I'm having the longer I last because I take time and slow down and I'm more focused on them and how they look or feel than I am on finishing or my own pleasure. \n\nIts different for anyone. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for how long a woman expects a man to last, that depends on them as well. How wet do they get and how long can they sustain it? That can affect how long they actually enjoy the sex. Lube is your friend. Do they get off easy? Or is it a challenge for them? Whats their sensitivity like? Do they get off more so from clit stimulation or penetration? If its penetration, do they prefer closer to the entrance or deeper? \n\nI've been with a lot of people, and every person is vastly difference. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS.

            "No, most penetrative sex is not lasting 15-30 minutes. At 20? Sure. Depends on the person, but it\u2019s certainly possible she\u2019s been with 4 guys that average a half hour. Unlikely, but possible. \n\nMy wife and I have been together since we were 14 and are now 42. Our first job was working in an adult video store her father managed when we were 15-16 and we\u2019ve always been highly sexual. Still at our age we still have a few marathon nights where we\u2019ll have a few drinks and have penetrative sex totaling hours, with breaks in between for foreplay. While fun in the moment, we regret it for days after because it takes several days for her to recover.\n\nMost of our sex lasts anywhere between 5 and 15 minutes, which is perfect. Sometimes a few minutes is all you want/need. Sometimes we just have to stop because I haven\u2019t came yet. Booze, morning wood, whatever. Sometimes I never cum. Sometimes it\u2019s over in a couple minutes. \n\nThis notion that men should be able to perform every time for 10, 20, 30, 60 minutes or more is absurd and it\u2019s dangerous. It sets an unrealistic expectation and when you fail to meet it, it can do a number on you mentally. You can start questioning your *manhood* and then it becomes a self-defeating cycle. \n\nYou can\u2019t set those expectations on yourself. Every mood and moment is different. Every experience is different. If something is off, communicate that with your partner. If you feel like you\u2019re not lasting long enough, communicate with your partner and figure out if that\u2019s even the reality. If it is, talk about how to approach it with them. I\u2019d they aren\u2019t understanding and on the same team, that\u2019s not a healthy relationship. \n\nIf you\u2019re planning on a full night of sex and you know you know you can last a few minutes, then talk about it. I like to call it \u201cgetting the easy one out of the way\u201d. It takes longer to orgasm the more you have, so spend time on forplay and when you recover, go again.",
            "No, sometimes sure but trust me they don't usually want 30 mins of penetration either",

Different People and I don't think I have ever gone over 30 mins of solid penetration.

Because you hear it a lot I guess. If they though about it, the better brag would be something like. \"No one can last more than 5 minutes once they put it in me.\"\n\nMoral of the story: the quality of sex has almost nothing to do with the duration of sex...

            "There are a lot of good comments about metabolism, diet and exercise.\n\nI don't see anything about the other major factor in controlling weight - hunger.\n\nA high carb/high sugar diet results in big peaks and big valleys in blood sugar. Low blood sugar triggers the experience of hunger. This means with a high sugar/carb diet, you can regularly experience hunger even when you have recently had too much caloric intake.\n\nStress and external experiences can sometimes develop into triggering hunger. Eating causes dopamine to be released. This can result in people eating as an adaptive behavior to stress. If you engage in this behavior enough, it can get to the point where stress alone can cause your brain to release hormones that trigger experience of hunger.\n\nThe microbiome in your gut also triggers hunger by releasing hormones that manipulate your brain into releasing other hormones that result in experiencing hunger.  This is particularly nasty because you may have eaten plenty of food for your body but if the food you ate isn't consumable by the signaling bacteria in your gut, it will release hormones that make you feel hungry.",

Here\u2019s what I know:\n\nNaturally slim people don\u2019t think about eating very much at all. In fact, they tend to skip meals quite often and have to remind themselves to eat. They don\u2019t particularly care to indulge, and the size of their meals are what you or I might consider a snack. They seldom finish their meals as they get full quite easily, and they take forever to eat the 3 bites of food in front of them. They over-estimate their intake by quite a bit. \n\nNaturally larger people are the opposite of this. They will eat larger portions, and tend to think they\u2019re eating healthy (like with a salad) when they are grossly underestimating the total fat/calories in a meal. They seldom stop eating before their plate is cleared (except maybe around others), and they eat quite frequent, calorie dense meals. \n\nI get told by thin clients that \u201comg I ate so much yesterday\u201d and that \u201cso much\u201d ends up being a bite of cheesecake after dinner. Thicker clients will say \u201cI didn\u2019t eat much dessert. I only had one piece.\u201d Perception is a MF. \n\nTl;dr \u2014 yes, you\u2019ll have to watch what you eat forever (me too).",

You\u2019re doing something not conducive to maintaining and you just don\u2019t realize it. There isn\u2019t anything mystically causing people to gain weight automatically without eating over their BMR. \n\nA lot of it is just that diets that are really promoted by the food industry aren\u2019t very healthy because the healthiest diets won\u2019t result in the greatest profits. So, a big part is just that people think they are eating in a way that will avoid weight gain when they actually aren\u2019t. \n\nAlso, the old saying goes that you can\u2019t out-exercise a bad diet, BUT people are by and large having a more sedentary lifestyle which sure doesn\u2019t help.\n\nMy advice is talk to a scientist about what foods you should be eating. Don\u2019t google articles or ask random fat people on the internet (nothing wrong with being fat btw, but fat people aren\u2019t experts on how to not be fat). Go sit in a room with a nutritionist with a successful track record and have them teach you about food.",

I still struggle with my weight. As women age, our hormones dictate our ability to lose weight more than anything. It might be time to get your hormone levels checked.",
            "No, not necessarily. For better or worse, some have a high metabolism or what we call in our family being \"whippets\", i.e. you can eat whatever you want all day and never gain weight. There's members in my parents' generation who've never weighed over 60 kg in their lives - super fit, eat constantly. It's genetic, and it's not always all it's cracked up to be."
