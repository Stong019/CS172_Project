This phenomenon is a pretty common  example in psych textbooks, usually in the form \"Paris in the the  spring\" in a triangle ([http://www.illusions.org/dp/1-5.htm](http://www.illusions.org/dp/1-5.htm)).  Various explanations have been provided, some of which are provided in  other comments, but they are usually pretty hand-wavy and, as far as we  could find, no one has actually tested any of these explanations. So,  with colleagues Adrian Staub and undergraduate Sophia Dodge, we explored  the relationship between eye movements and detection of repeated words.    \n>  \n>I was waiting until our paper was publicly available to post. Here are the the title and abstract:  \n>  \n>Failure to detect function word repetitions and omissions in reading: Are eye movements to blame?  \n>  \n>We tested whether failure to notice repetitions of function words  during reading (e.g., Amanda jumped off the the swing and landed on her  feet.) is due to the eyes\u2019 tendency to skip one of the instances of the  word. Eye movements were recorded during reading of sentences with  repetitions of the word the or repetitions of a noun, after which  readers were asked whether an error was present. A repeated the was  detected on 46% of trials overall. On trials on which both instances of  the were fixated, detection was still only 66%. A repeated noun was  detected on 90% of trials, with no significant effect of eye movement  patterns. Detecting an omitted the also proved difficult, with eye  movement patterns having only a small effect. Readers frequently  overlook function word errors even when their eye movements provide  maximal opportunity for noticing such errors, but they notice content  word repetitions regardless of eye movement patterns. We propose that  readers overlook function word errors because they attribute the  apparent error to noise in the eye movement control system.  \n>  \n>And the full paper in Psychonomic Bulletin and Review is here:   \n>  \n>Staub, A., Dodge, S. & Cohen, A.L.

            "There were lots of exceptions to the one-child policy (which is a bit of a misnomer in itself), and multiple births were among them. Parents were not penalized for having twins, at least not according to the letter of the law.",
            "We have 2 sets of boy/girl twins. (Ages 4&1). I had an older Chinese lady at my work who was so excited that we had one set, then lost her shit when I told her about the second. \n\nShe told me in China that it\u2019s called the dragon & phoenix and is considered lucky. She said it was one of the only ways to have a family with both a boy and girl. \n\nThe following week she showed up again and gave me $20 for the kids. It was very sweet.",
            "One child policy was cancelled in 2015, allowing 2 children since 2016. During the 30+ years the policy existed, people were allowed to have more children as part of affirmative action and other exceptions, including multiple birth. The exceptions were quite broad, so during that time almost half of Chinese citizens actually had more than one child.",
            "Good question. Twins were obviously allowed.\n\nSome places noticed this and there was a black market for hormones that increased the chances for twins.\n\nSo there are some villages in China that have ridiculous amounts of twins.",
            "This policy like the commenter said above had many exceptions. The one child policy really just meant for most at least that the government would only \u2018support\u2019 your first child. If you had enough money you could have more children. It also didn\u2019t apply if you were part of a Chinese ethnic minority. \nAlthough in small towns and villages some village \u2018grandmothers/elders\u2019 would inform the government if a woman became pregnant a second time and would \u2018encourage\u2019 women to be sterilised. \nPs. If you had more than one child you would have to repay some of the financial support given for the first child.",
            "From what I was told by one of my history teachers, twins were an exception along with disabled kids",
            "As someone born in the one child policy ages, I did have twin classmates. I lived in the city, where one child policy is highly enforced . I heard that it's less strictly enforced in the rural area.",
            "My friends are from China. \n\nThey have siblings but only one.\n\nIt depends on where you live. \n\nMost of them have one boy and one girl. \n\nIt wasn't as strict as the media portrayed it. \nHowever, a lot of lower class individuals were punished..which is terrible either way.",
            "I asked my friend from China this and he said of course both babies could live if they were born at the same time. And he also said wrt there being so many males, the government allowed you to have a second child if the first was a girl. And many richer males sometimes go to other countries (e.g. Vietnam) to find a wife\n\nI have a few Chinese friends who have at least two siblings. Apparently families can pay extra fees to have more than one child. And the policy was structured more towards urban areas (the friends with siblings I know are from very rural areas and it wasn't as strict) and for members of the Communist Party (a significant portion of the population).\n\nBut my friend is also a part of the Party so I take what he told me with a grain of salt...",
            "Chinese people, me being one as well, put huge emphasises on the importance of giving birth to a boy rather than a girl. To a family, a man's duty is to be the breadwinner and take care of his own parents, while the daughter is sent off to another family for marriage and responsible for taking care of her husband's parents. \n(This is in areas where it's poor and the people aren't aware of proper sex education, don't have the funds for various things.) (I am also not sure about twins, but I am sure of kids in general)\n\n\nWhen the one child policy was put into place, there were certain punishments you can get if you're caught with more than one new child. One of them being to pay a hefty fine. From what I can recall, a very rich movie director paid after his wife gave birth to another child. \n\nWhat I said is just an oversimplification, I'm sure you can find more info somewhere else. There is, however, a documentary called \"The Dying Room\" where a white female and her crew travel to various villages seeing how the orphanages are. Like I've said before, a lot of families especially the poor ones prefer a boy over a girl, so what happens is if they don't get what they want, they'll send their baby girl to the orphanages. Even something as slight as a lip deformity, regardless of gender, they also get sent. Keep in mind it isn't the case for everyone, but you have to understand it isn't uncommon either. Most of the orphanages were run on extremely low fund, the children are all put into a chair with their feet tied, and below the chair is a pot for them to urinate. A lot of them would rock back and forth due to the lack of proper stimulation from a parent. Some had injuries on their feet that could easily have been treated with proper healthcare and money. One orphanage actually seemed decent and had all the kids playing in a festival with toys. On their last visit, a child was seen skin to bone deep, extremely malnourished and unclean eyes shut tight. He died some time later. A lot of these orphanages back then were run on low fund, and a good amount of the female workers didn't even have any form of proper education needed to take care of the child. \n\nYou ask what of the twins in China that were born under the one child policy? Unfortunately for those that aren't twins, this is what happens when the Chinese culture puts a heavy importance on males, and without educating people about condoms, abortion and other options on safe sex, this is what it leads to for some places. I don't want to paint a bad picture of my own country because nothing is black and white, but even if these cases are small and rare, each number is still a child that lost their life.",
            "As far as I know I think it depended on where in China you lived as there were different implantation of the policy in different areas. Rural families were allowed two children if the first was a girl and incentives were put in place to reward those couples with one child with a financial stipend and a one child glory certificate.",
            "\"One child policy\" was more like \"one birth policy\" you can give birth once and if two or more come out at a time you'd be fine",
            "I forget the answer but Amazon prime has an incredible documentary called \u201cone child nation\u201d.  And I remember just being glued to the screen. Highly recommend because the policy is wayyyyy more messed up than you could have even imagined",
            "It's probably more like one pregnancy, but it's easier to say child.",
            "You were considered lucky and got a way to have a second kid without paying a huge fine.",
            "Burner Account so take it the way you want it to be.\n\nTwins are just fine, the intention was to prevent 2nd pregnancy and beyond. If purely by nature you conceive a twin or even triplets it's just fine. Also special cases can be made say medical reasons, like needing the cord blood of that 2nd child to save the 1st with Leukemia etc.\n\nIf you want to hear more about the topic, I was considered the early ones of this one-child generation, so is my wife however she has 2 other siblings.  So this will cover both of sides of the story. And to OP's very question, I have twin friends growing up together, just normal life.\n\nOK here we go..\n\nIn the early years there were indeed atrocious inhumane intervention like forced abortion but those afaik were fairly rare and majorly concentrated in the rural areas of China where the public didn't care much about the policy and the law enforcement was equally uneducated. I'm not saying it's extremely rare and I don't have solid data to back it up, however my grandparents and many relatives are in the rural area I haven't heard stories like those directly from them.\n\nEventually the punishment came in \"soft\" manners which may had carried more weights to them. For example, if you are a public servant and if the 2nd pregnancy had come to labor, that kid will be fine but you will lose your job. Similarly for other occupancies, if you work for a state owned corp, you may lose your job or never be promoted; if you have a private business, you may not be able to renew your permit for years to come. Of course there are also monetary fines.\n\nThere was also soft punishment towards these kids in early years and my wife was one of them. So China has this household registration system which can be loosely compared to SS but it's tied up to attending school, healthcare and all public benefits and to some extent many of your rights. The local law enforcement will downright decline the registration for the 2nd kid and beyond to those household (of course twins are exempt). My wife had to spent couple early years with some relatives and registered under their family etc.\n\nEventually there's no one getting hurt or even going to jail but lives are heavily affected, if not totally diverted from what they could have been. The vibe became that you can have as many kids as you want but you may not be able to afford them. And as the population growth gap started to reveal, this soft punishment got weaker and before the policy officially came to an end it was basically monetary fines, for the most part.\n\nAnd all these can be manipulated thru Guanxi.. Like I mentioned earlier, my parents-in-law have 3 kids, eventually they are just, all fine.. But they may be the lucky ones. Things aren't pretty but aren't as ugly as they may have be portraited.",
            "I happened to have a Chinese friend in grad school and we used to discuss this a lot. From what I can recall:\n- twins, no issue\n- rural residents, can have a second child if first is girl (needs men to do farm work)\n- ethnic minority (Mongolians, Uighur, etc) can have 2\n- if you are rich and don\u2019t have to have a job, you can have as many as you want, just pay the fine\n- city residents who work for state run companies or government officials, these are the people who could almost  never have more than one kid because they will lose jobs. The only exception is if he\u2019s a minority or the first child has disabilities.\n- enforcement varies a lot by regions. In general, it\u2019s pretty strict in north and much less in south (my friend is from Fujian and he has 2 siblings). He said the penalty was a small fine, and his younger brothers were denied from having Hukou after birth. But usually a few years later, before school age they would be registered in Hukou. \n\nOne quite interesting thing I learned, one child policy never made into law. It was just like that, a policy.",
            "Chinese here. I wasn't born in China but I knew a few people born in China or had children in China under the one child policy and there seems to be a number of exceptions.\n\nMy friend was born in China, she was 3rd out of four girls. She said that her parents paid a fee for each child after the first and only the eldest sister was allowed to go to school.\n\nI went to rural China once and there were a lot of the families with 2 kids, usually an elder girl and a younger boy. I specifically remember one couple who had a daughter in her mid teens and a daughter who was still a toddler. I heard that they had like 4 or five other daughters in between the two girls who \"died\" in infancy (read suffocation by the parents) because they wanted a boy. I remember my mother mentioning a conversation she had with the parents where she convinced them to give up trying for a boy and allow the toddler girl to live because she was so cute. They suffocated her months later. This was in the 80s. I don't know if the couple ever got the son they wanted.\n\nMy mother also had a co worker who hid her second pregnancy by going to a rural village for a few months and gave birth. She left her second child in the village for a couple of years and then \"adopted\" him. The the real juicy bit about this co worker? She was an abortionist for the government. It was her job to perform the abortion on women who didn't want abortions but was forced due to the one child policy.",
            "I'm 28, year after I was born my mom got pregnant again and was forced to abort or faced termination at her job. We came from a wealthy coastal province surrounding Shanghai, so our province (with Beijing obviously) were heavily scrutinized back then. \n\nThere were other provinces that did not enforce so strictly.\n\n20 years later I have \"another\" sibling. There should have been 3 of us, but there are only 2",
            "They (According to what I know) were allowed to live. So many women took fertility meds to have twins so they could have more than 1 kid.",
            "I used to work with a Chinese lady- now living in the UK- who was one of twin girls, born during the one child policy rules. She told me once that when people found out her mother was pregnant with twin girls, everyone just assumed she was going to have an abortion, and try again, because who wants \\*two\\* girls?\n\nThrough her whole childhood, she never knowingly met another girl with a sister.",
            "I used to work in a Chinese takeaway and the woman who owned it said that you could have one pregnancy, so be it one child, twins, triplets, quadruplets and so forth as long as it\u2019s one pregnancy then it was allowed. She also had her eyeliner tattooed on.",
            "They didn't actually shoot and bury kid #2 even then, you know. Even assuming twins were not an exception to the rule, and they were, the second kid would have cost the parents some but nothing would happen to the child, obviously.\n\nNow, the fact that parents pretty often covertly murdered born girl children so they could have a boy child instead was a bigger issue, and the ratio of men vs women in China is still warped to this day, there aren't remotely enough women for all men to find a partner; the one-child policy was stupid and unworkable, and the culture in China that prizes male children so much is moronic, and so are the consequences. It's the women who are made to suffer, as  usual.",
            "I know a lot of people who said their parents had to lie that they had twins, when it was actually two children close in age, so both could survive.",
            "Twins were exempt. And some people would try to get away with having kids who's ages were close together by saying those kids were actually twins.",
            "One has to remember the One Child policy was not a universal policy, but sets of overlapping regional policies guided by one national goal. Examples of this include the allowance of rural families to keep having children until they had a boy (though this did not fulfill the goal of reducing the abortions of female fetuses) or the allowance of twins under variable circumstances. Another thing to remember was that unless you were extremely poor, there was not a lot of forced abortions but rather very stringent social policies to discourage a family from having a second child. Examples of this include preventing a second child from receiving documentation to go to school, get healthcare, even get a job; heavy fines; and public shaming. Even twins could fall under this policy. \n\nI have personal experience with only one family who were clients of mine. By the time I knew them, they were very wealthy and had sent their son to the United States to study. On a trip to China they invited me to a dinner where I was shocked to see the son who should have been in class back in the states. It was only then I was told the family had had twins. After dinner, I asked one of my associates about why the kid hadn't joined his brother and was treated to a horrifically sad story.\n\nThe family came from an area where even twins were not allowed and so the family had to send one of their sons away to live with his grandparents secretly since the father worked for the government and couldn't do anything \"inappropriate.\" Unlike the son I knew well, this one had had to be tutored privately and never went to school. Separated from his parents, he only saw them twice a year and now that he was older, he no official identity in China, and was living on his absent brother's ID.",
            "Ha clearly you are a stupid CIA Anarkitten who only listens to western propaganda you liberal fascist. No such policy existed you fool. /s",
            "Chinese here. If you have twins then you don\u2019t have to kill one of them. If you have one and want to have another one, sorry the government will force you to abort.",
            "Many siblings had to be hidden in preference/pursuit of having male children. if both twins were girls the likelihood of them growing up in another family, in another city, assuming a different name is high. if the twins were boy-girl, it is likely the girl was hid. Many girls have this experience as older sisters and twins, being hid under floorboards like Anne Frank did, but in another province far away from their real family.",

            "If you upload anything that is questionable concerning their terms & conditions, it is removed immediately until it is reviewed. In the case of minors, the uploader must present documentation that proves age, at which time the video is restored. They tend to take any flagged content seriously and err on the side of caution. ",
            "I think the FBI helps out. ",
            "Pornhub absolutely has sexual content of people under the age of 18 on it.  However very, very little of it are people *noticeably* under the 18.  If someone is ten, then obviously it will almost immediately be reported and removed.  If someone is 17 then there's no real way of knowing unless the person in the video casually mentions being a junior in high school or if someone recognizes her and proves her age to pornhub.  \n\nWhat helps is that professional porn companies don't hire people under the age of 18, so anything that's professional looking is legal.  And most other stuff is legal anyway.  And you have to admit, that if someone who is 17 posts self-made porn there, even though they probably *shouldn't* do that as I think it's a bad idea, they're probably not going to be victimized by their decision as an equivalent to a sex tape with a straight up child.  ",
            "The National Center for Missing and Endangered Children maintains a huge database of every CP image and video that law enforcement knows about. A lot of people get caught because they upload CP to Google Drive or some other cloud service. Those services utilize a content matching system similar to YouTube's content ID. I would assume that Pornhub is also using this service.",
            "I seem to recall hearing about it actually being a great place for IT people to work.  I assume if it\u2019s such a great place, they hire top talent which would in turn mean that they likely have vast safeguards against it.  What exactly those safeguards are, though, I am not sure.",
            "I used to work as a site admin for Pornotube.com the way we handled it was we put every uploaded video on a delay until it could be reviewed by one of the team. Usually took about 16 hours to get approved, but each of us would check the upload queue a few times each day and clear the stack of vids. Luckily this was about 10 years ago, pornhub was just starting so traffic wasn't quite as heavy at that time and most of the content being posted to any tube site was either pirated porn scenes or dudes jacking off. So it wasn't as daunting a task as it has to be now.",

            "Most sites that have to worry about child porn get a database of hashes from law enforcement. Images are then checked against this database of hashes.\n\nWhat's a hash? A hash is a seemingly random string of 1s and 0s, but which are actually deterministically dependent on the input you give it. A website with decent password security will not actually save your password, it will save a hash of your password. A good hashing algorithm makes it more or less impossible to reconstruct an input from a given hash. For something like passwords you can actually brute force things, especially if you know that people's passwords aren't likely to be truly random inputs. But the sort of algorithms used to detect known child porn is not going to let a person reconstruct that image from the hash. I don't know all the specific details of what's used on something like PornHub, but I know that's the basic idea. A number is calculated from the video that's uploaded, and they check to see if that number is in the database.",

It is a VERY SERIOUS CRIME that can screw a persons life forever and end up in years of prison, and there's literally zero benefits because its against the TOS of Pornhub... therefore you wouldn't get any profit. 2nd. I'm sure Pornhub has good security measures like IP tracking or verifications prior to uploading a video in their website, or at least some form of approval.",
            "I would imagine they do the best they can, however I would be willing to bet a lot of money that many girls are underage especially porn from other third world countries. I\u2019m not talking like 17 and a half I\u2019m talking girls probably as young as 12. My nieces who are 12,13,14 (my sister is crazy and had her girls one after another) are very beautiful girls who look much much older. They are all tall, very endowed, and are much more mature, including the youngest one. While I don\u2019t think they are the norm it\u2019s definitely not unusual for girls to look so much older. I was often mistaken to be older when I was a young teen girl, and many of their friends look much older too and I\u2019m always shocked at how much they get hit on by older men thinking they are older. So what I\u2019m getting at is that there\u2019s absolutely a ton of underage porn on sites like porn hub and ideally there would be some way of verifying the ages of the participants. Scary stuff.

            "EDIT: I want to say ahead of time that this is all speculation. I might be entirely wrong.

Once upon a time, among the results, I stumbled upon a omegle video that involved a guy and a clearly underage girl; rather disturbing stuff. I went through his profile, and all his videos were his conversations with (usually faceless) Polish girls, some of whom STATING their ages (in one case as low as 15) in the chat log (prior to the captured conversation). Obviosuly, I've reported each and every of the videos (I'm still puzzled that pornhub allows posting that kind of crap, does not seen very consensual). I don't have an account, so couldn't monitor if any actions were being taken. Yet, weeks or months later, when I was, again, browing \"patriotically\", his submissions were among the results, and I got pissed. Strangely, his account was gone, but the videos were still avaible. Again, I've reported them; but lost any interest since, as, prior to that, I had really thought that Pornhub was rather effective in preventing questionable material (I don't remember stumbling upon anything that would make me question the age of participants).

You'd actually be surprised how many pairs of words are both synonyms AND antonyms of each other. For example, \"have\" and \"need\".  If you need to do something, then you have to do it.

            "English is such a fucking mess",
            "Great question. I just looked it up, and \"terrific\" actually used to fall in line with its root. It used to mean \"causing great fear.\"\n\nEven today, its formal meaning is \"great size, amount or intensity,\" which is pretty easy to imagine having at least a loose link to the \"fear\" root. The \"great\" definition is, even in the dictionary, just an informal meaning.\n\nSo, it appeared to mean \"great\" in some influential context, and those of us who didn't know better just started aping that usage. And now its informal definition stands completely at odds with its formal definition and its structural definition.\n\n\"Terrific's\" structural meaning is weird, though. It's Latinate, so its root appears to be \"terr\" with suffix \"ific.\" \"Terr\" means \"earth\" and \"ific\" as a suffix means \"creating or causing.\"\n\nSo \"terrific\" should structurally mean something like \"creating land.\" So a terraforming machine would be described as \"terrific\" as it \"terrifies\" Mars.\n\nSo I don't know. Languages and people are pretty dumb. Systems of meaning are invented and work for a little bit, but then nobody pays attention in school, we all graduate with Ds and then you get terrifying movies and terrific dinners.\n\nEDIT: Looks like the Latinate root of \"terrific\" is the Latin word for \"terror.\" It's \"terrere\" not \"terr.\" Even Latin roots get weirdly similar to one another, and it looks like terrific's structural meaning is right there in line with its archaic meaning.

It was so terrifying, and these horrors should never be repeated by ANYONE. It was horrible! Horrified I defended myself terribly, and that's when she terrorized me by hitting me none stop for hours. Later I learned she was a terrorist spy.\"\n\n What two horrible but terrific words that have so many terrible functions. I never thought about it. That story makes sense I hope, haha. Sorry for those that read it.",

            "Once I had a dream where my parents got in a car accident in my dad's car. I thought it was just a weird dream because in real life they always use our other car, my dad's car is for his work. That day they weren't home, and I was with my grandmother. I thought they were working but when they didn't come home well after their work scedule ended I asked my grandma where they were. She said our other car was in service and my parents went to retrieve it with my dad's car. I started crying and begging my gradma to call them. She tried to calm me by saying they are probably just shopping or in a traffic jam or something but she started to worry after we couldn't reach them. Turns out they were actually in a car accident, but fortunately no one got hurt badly.",
            "Yeah I always assume the worst and start panicking",
            "My mom died in a car accident 23 years ago so I do get anxious whenever my dad or anyone else is late.",
            "This is called generalized anxiety",
            "Helpfully, my mother was almost never on time. So you never really get this anxiety.\n\nYou do get kind of stressed out if you were as a friend and had to be ready for pickup at 18:00 and she DID show up on time, that was usually a sign something bad had been discovered and I was going to get grounded again.",
            "I had a phase of severe separation anxiety as a child, that only gradually ameliorated with therapy and time. I used to get panic attacks if my parents were even 1 minute late to anything, and assume the worst had happened.",

            "I feel like I was born knowing my mother is physically incapable of shutting the fuck up.  \n\nI always assume she\u2019s holding some polite stranger hostage in a one sided conversation somewhere.  She doesn\u2019t discriminate\u2026 family, friends, cashiers, panhandlers, solicitors, the unfortunate vendor at the mall who thought to make eye contact trying to sell his overpriced soap\u2026 she\u2019ll go for hours without letting you get a word in.  She\u2019ll follow you if you try to walk away.  I\u2019ve had to go on rescue missions to liberate people from her conversations lol",

            "My mom doesn\u2019t drive anymore but when she did this was my way of thinking and gave me so much anxiety as a child. If she was late picking me up from school, if she stayed out with her friends too long. I think it has a lot to do with my dad dying when I was 5. I remember the last time I talked to him and he said he\u2019d be home soon from the hospital. Our last conversation (I\u2019m glad I remember it). He never came home.",

            "No because I\u2019m really used to my parents and siblings being late to everything",
            "No, when you had the shit childhood I had, you just assume they forgot you again.  Then you eventually just start walking home.",
            "No, an that's a sign of anxiety and or depression. Maybe talk to a doctor about it.",
            "No, cause they never tell me when they're coming back",
            "To this day whenever my grandma is visiting us and I walk by her room when she\u2019s sleeping I stop for a moment to see if she\u2019s breathing. Once I see her chest rise and fall I then move on with relief. \n\nI also did the car crash thing when I was younger.\n\nI\u2019m 21 and the older I get the more I find myself doing this.",
            "Every single time. This is a pretty common symptom of Generalized Anxiety Disorder, so if you're not yet diagnosed with it I'd suggest asking your doctor about it. It could be nothing, but if it *is* GAD, you'll know what you need to do to help yourself.",
            "As a kid, if I came home from school and was locked out, my mind went into overdrive and I always thought something really bad had happened to my parents. As I got older, I realized they were just bad time keepers.",
            "haha ya. I still get this thought about anyone who\u2019s late or doesn\u2019t show.",
            "Whenever anyone is late, I assume they fell in a frightfully large hole.",
            "Yep. And my partner. And anyone I love. Therapy helps but it never fully goes away, and gets worse when I'm stressed.",
            "No because both my parents have passed away.\nI wish they were still alive for me to worry about at least I'd know they are still alive and I can hug them and tell them I love them one more time.\nIt's been a few years since I lost them and I miss them terribly. My heart is still breaking and I dream about my mom a couple of times a week and I am so happy in the dream but when I wake up and realize I was just dreaming I tear up.\nFour months after my dad died he came to me in a dream appearing like a brilliant gold tornado that landed next to me and just looked at me and said, \"Everything's gonna be alright.\" then as suddenly as he appeared he was zooming upwards towards the sky.\nThis happened at 5:15am and I know this because I looked at my clock when I fully woke up.\nAround noon I called my brother across town to meet up for lunch and casualty mentioned  my strange dream and he got wide eyed and said, Omg, I had the same dream!\"\nHe however had a slightly different conversation with our dad where he was told \"I know you are doing your best without me.\"\nI asked him what time did your dream happen? so as not to lead him on to what I had seen on my clock. He said, \" About 5:30am.\"\nBoth had it happen within 15 minutes apart. This is why I know in my heart there is a heaven.",
            "Nah, I have my father's death certificate on the desk next to me right now. I'm certain how he died.",
            "I didn't need to assume anything. My parents were always late picking me up from anywhere.",
            "Yes I thought like that, and I'm an adult and everytime my husband isn't home when I expect him to be I assume he's dead.",
            "No, my abandonment issues just get worse",
            "It\u2019s the only logical thing to think if someone is more than 5 minutes late",
            "Nah I just assume my dad is passed out drunk again",
            "No, but I do assume that if somebody tells me that their parents died in a car accident, at least one of those parents is going to show up for a season finale cliffhanger.",
            "I do this all the time with my parents and siblings. The uncertainty of life and inevitable danger scares me. That\u2019s why I often accompany them whenever I have the time",
            "No, but my girlfriend assumes I died anytime I don\u2019t text back within and hour or so. Or if I take longer to get home than usual.",
            "I am always worried something happened if people I love don't appear on time. I would be surprised if others were any different.",
            "Yup. But not just my parents, everyone.\nFigured it\u2019s trauma from so many of my loved ones dying in car accidents when I was younger.",
            "Yea I was panicking as a kid when they didn't showed up. I used to cry somewhere in the house and hugged them for minutes when they came home",
            "As a kid, absolutely. \n\nAnd oddly enough, when I was pregnant, I used to have these horrible thoughts/fears about my husband too. It was so bad. I made him call or text me once he got places. I\u2019m not usually like that lol",
            "Yes. If you continue having these types of thoughts as an adult, you may have an anxiety disorder.",
            "Yeah when I was like 13 and they started leaving me alone to go to the shop or something I was actually trying to work out where they would make me live if they died because they were gone for like 4 hours. Turns out they just went to several shops and bought a lot of shit lol",
            "No I call them and ask. But I always give people a 15 minute window of being late",
            "I used to think mine were always taking me somewhere to be killed.",
            "I assume that with eveybody and it's very difficult to deal with alot of the time.",
            "Hell, I'm 39yo and do this. The anxiety is a bitch! I always jump to worst case scenario. Therapy seems to help though and I'm making progress.",
            "Nope, but my brother always did, he'd make me call our mom to ask her why she's late etc. After a while I'd call her and say \"hi! F is freaking out that your dead cause your 20 min late. Are you going to be home soon?\" Bro got very upset that I couldn't pretend it was me who was worried/nervous about her being late and eventually stopped nagging me/started calling her himself. We're in our 30s now and he still gets worried if she's more than 10 minutes late, luckily mom's very punctual so it's not a big problem.",
            "My family don't own a car lol",
            "Once my mom's phone died and she didn't answer the whole day as she was on the road, doing shopping etc. We were freaking out",
            "All the time. And they never answer their phones. Actually once I woke up during the night to the door closing sound (I was 10 years old) and there was nobody at home. I saw some bloody cotton pads and our car was gone. I thought someone abducted my family? They also left their phones at home. Turns out my baby sister fell off the bed and her hair clips got stuck into her chin and it started bleeding (they did not even notice the bleeding at the dark, my dad decided to double check and open the lights and there were lots of blood). One of the longest nights of my life. I\u2019m 26 now and I am still afraid someone abducted them or they had a car crash when they are late.\nAlso, when someone I love takes a plane, I check for plane crash updates couple of times.",
            "In University I did, then my mom actually did die when she didn't show up. Not from a car accident though",
            "My mom died when I was 10 days old and I\u2019d stay at my grandparents\u2019 place when my dad would go out Saturday nights when I was a kid and I would be anxious all Sunday morning trying to call and him not picking up. It was like that until I was about 12 or so.",
            "Yeah, it's been like this for me ever since my dad died when I was 10. Every time someone doesn't respond to my messages my mind will start defaulting to these scenarios.Shit sucks.",
            "Always!!",
            "yes everytime",
            "Every fucking time\ud83d\ude05 30 and still do it.",

            "If I'm only meeting my dad, nah, he's usually 5-10 minutes later. If I'm meeting mum and dad, I worry because mum has a knacj of being dead on time to the second.",

            "I got a phone call saying my car had been impounded one day after my mum had borrowed it, it was raining outside and she would not answer my calls! A car accident was the first thing that popped into my head, turns out she just parked in an illegal parking spot in the city and thats why the car was impounded. Her phone also had run out of battery, it was an awful feeling!",
            "Don't worry\n One day you'll have those exact same thoughts about your kids.",
            "No. I am worrier, but they are ALWAYS late.",
            "25 and my brain still jumps to this whenever people don\u2019t come back on time",
            "No they just died for me when they were abusive scum to vulnerable innocent children",
            "Yeah. My god I've been stressed over this way too many times.. and then they'd come back and be like 'we were drinking coffee'",
            "I was dogwatching for my mom and step dad the past few weeks while they were out of town. When I moved back to mine I forgot a few things and told her I would be over the next day to pick them up. Neither of them were home, which is an anomaly, but she didn\u2019t pick up her phone for calls nor responded to any texts for 3 hours after. I had my irrational sigh of relief yesterday",

            "I call my husband at 6pm if he's not home from work yet to see if he's \"dead in a ditch\".  He's self employed so his arrival times home vary but is usually home by 6 pm even when he worked 3 hours away.",

Or he flew and the entire plan was for her to drive out to pick him up for some together time. She wanted to know if we wanted to come along to get him.

It's when you imagine a worst case scenario (or an strongly negative) scenario, typically without having sufficient evidence or reason to believe that it will turn out that way. It's a form of jumping to conclusions. \"My boss wants to talk to me after work. She's probably going to fire me.\" \"I didn't prepare enough for the test. I'm probably going to fail the class.\" \n\nThe worst part about when this is happening is that it becomes hard to stop. You get caught up in the catastrophe you're imagining and, at that time, it can seem entirely rational and probable. I liken it to being on a hamster wheel, spinning and not knowing how to get off that line of thought. Recognizing that you're doing it in the moment is the first way to break that chain. Then it's a matter of reality testing: \"Do I have real evidence that things will turn out like that? Did something like this happen to me before and now I'm assuming it'll have the same outcome this time? If I asked someone whose opinion I trust whether my thinking seems to make sense, what would they say?\" There are lots of ways to challenge the intrusive thought. The first part, though, as mentioned, is to take note that what you're thinking might be catastrophizing. \n\nIf you look up cognitive distortions or catastrophizing or challenging cognitive distortions, you'll find a tons of helpful information about it.\n\nSource: school counselor for 20 years; status as a master catastrophizer myself.",

            "No but that is pretty much what my mom assumes about me literally 100% of the time in the same situation \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23",
            "I just assumed they were going to be 30 minutes late because they always were.",
            "The hope was always false.",
            "There's a lot of comments in this thread but I'm just gonna leave this here anyway: Separation anxiety disorder https://g.co/kgs/zxyHN5\n\nI suffered from it when I was a kid, followed by social anxiety and generalized anxiety in later stages of life. I don't know how old you are OP (and you don't have to share), but if you feel this way, it's worth exploring early in life whether treatment can help. I approached it in my early 30s, and I regret not doing so sooner.",
            "My mother always assumed that about me.",
            "i do assume this about my mother  \nbut i have all the rights to do so, my father actually died in a car accident a few years ago",
            "Hey yall look of symptoms of anxiety",
            "YES, ITS A BIG PROBLEM.\nits mainly because they cross the shibuya crossing on the way back from work",
            "Yeah",
            "Wife. But yeah. \n\nIf my parents don\u2019t show up on time \ud83d\udcaf they died in a car accident.",
            "Oh fuck.   I thought it was just me haha.  Yay I\u2019m not alone.",
            "I had this fear all my childhood. I would cry and wait for them. Pray to god. It was crazy. When i left home, it got better. I still get anxiety if they don\u2019t answer my calls on time.",
            "yes.",
            "A few years ago a couple of kids killed some people on a remote highway the same day my dad was traveling through the same area. There was a little worrying until I was able to contact him.",
            "No but I assume my girlfriend died in a car accident multiple times a week.",
            "Anyone here remember in the Ultimate X-Men comic, when a kid's mutant power activated, and everyone around him disintegrated, causing him to wake up to a weirdly quiet and empty house, with no idea where his family is, unaware that they've just been killed by his mutant power?\n\nFor a while after reading that, I found it unnerving to get up in the morning and find that nobody was around. Like, I knew of course that everyone else was either just still in bed or already out, but having that sense of stillness in the morning just kind of reminded me of that comic.",
            "I would usually assume they were late but sure",
            "Similar, but I literally start to think the Rapture done happened while I was asleep whenever I\u2019m home and realize nobody else is.",
            "My dad's a professional bus driver, so.... every night it's crash or murdered",
            "My mom used to drive home drunk almost every night when I was in high school. This exact scenario happened every single night. Freaked me the fuck out. Thankfully she's stopped now",
            "Usually it's the other way round",
            "Yes.. because my boyfriend is always texting and driving and I hate it so much!! When I\u2019m with him I\u2019m always telling him to stop but when I\u2019m not with him I get worried.",
            "In 2007 when the I-35W bridge collapsed in Minneapolis it happened right when my mom was getting off work. I called and called cuz I knew she took that highway home. No answer for 2-3 hours. Thought she was in the rubble on TV and my mind started racing a million miles. Then all of a sudden she walks through the door with groceries. That's why she didn't answer lol. Such a relie, but man yep I did this all the time as a kid.",
            "Used to as a kid, not really anymore. I eventually realized that the chance that something happened was pretty low.",
            "Always, since the day that it really happened. They went to the hospital but didn't call me. I was at home, I felt this strange feeling... so I called and they told me about the accident. They we're OK, fortunately!",
            "Nope, never had a thought even close to this. I always had friends as a kid to keep me company in school and as a teen/preteen always just walked/biked. Guess I was a lucky kid, reading these comments.",
            "I usually say \"Must have been murdered by pirates\" but yes ... I do that.   \nI also refuse to send angry texts or leave \"Where the hell are you?!?\" voicemails --- just in case. I don't want to end up on a episode of Dateline.",
            "I sit at home making up all kinds of horrible scenarios as to why my SO is taking so long to get home. Anxiety is a hell of a drug.",
            "Omg yes!",
            "I have a deep rooted fear that everyone I love will die as soon as we part ways, so i always end our conversations with \u201cI love you\u201d because the last thing I would want them to hear from me is that I love them. This could be in person, over the phone, family, friends, it don\u2019t matter. I love you and y\u2019all gonna know it. \n\nI may have slight abandonment issues."
