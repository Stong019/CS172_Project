            "We say the [Pledge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pledge_of_Allegiance) of Allegiance in schools but nobody I went to school with put much thought into the words we just repeated it by rote. \n\nKids do have the Constitutional [right](https://www.freedomforuminstitute.org/first-amendment-center/topics/freedom-of-speech-2/k-12-public-school-student-expression/pledge-of-allegiance/#:~:text=Conclusion,speech%20doctrine%20requires%20as%20much.) to sit and be quiet instead of participating.",
            "I am in Asia and I used to go to an American school. The American kids did their pledge after our national anthem and pledge. \nWhen I went to uni I noticed that they only played our anthem during ceremonies and there were no pledges.",
            "In Texas they have us swear to the American flag AND the Texas flag. Two separate swears  \n    \n     \nedit: This is not all schools, your Texas school district probably had different guidelines for the pledge, if they did it at all. It's not something new, it just depends on your district. I know plenty that do and plenty that don't",
            "Yes. Every single morning without fail. I'm reading in this thread that it's not legally required, but when I was a kid (in the 80s and 90s) you'd get in big trouble if you tried not to say it. I mean big trouble by kid standards of course; yelled at by the teacher and sent to the principal's office for example.\n\nOnce we had a substitute teacher who was an old veteran and he became absolutely enraged when a kid in the class tried to sit out the pledge.",
            "Yes. Went with my high school to the US to see our penpals (honestly great way to create bonds across oceans , still friends with them a decade later). \n\nFollowed my penpal to her high school and was quite embarrassed because It's not something we do in Europe and I didn't want to be disrespectful. They had their hands on the chest and I felt it was weird/hypocritical if I did so but I felt it was disrespectful to stay in my seat so I just stood up and waited.",
            "I remember being in elementary school and watching a news program like 60 minutes and there was a girl who got in trouble because she didn't want to say the under God part of the pledge.",
            "Some schools even sing the national anthem right after saying the pledge",
            "I haven't seen anyone post the actual pledge, so here it is for the people across borders.\n\n\"I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which is stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all\"",
            "They *say* it. They don\u2019t *mean* it.",
            "I went to a lot of schools and it was generally phased out by high school (ages 14 to 18). Almost every school has the kids younger than that pledge every morning first thing.",
            "No...... You 'Pledge' allegiance. \n\nI stopped in high school. You get weird looks in southern schools sometimes as a result. Even from the teachers.",
            "Even creepier was the [Bellamy salute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellamy_salute) that was supposed to be done while pledging allegiance.\n\nConservatives would be aghast to learn that Bellamy, who wrote the pledge, was a socialist.  And even though he was a minister's son, he did not include the \"under God\", that was inserted during the Red scare years.",
            "Yes. Although many do not understand this is an optional thing. I realized about 9th grade that no one was gonna do anything if the weird kid in class decided, screw allegiance today, and then pass around a form to start their own militia instead. (I really did that, I was a very strange teenager, what's stranger people actually signed up)",
            "Bruh I\u2019m in high school and I still do that every morning",
            "As far as I'm aware this usually is a thing we did in schools and not really anywhere else. We had to do it every morning at the start of the school day. It was weird as hell. Not to mention I went to public school and it states in the pledge \"one nation under god\" as if everyone believes in the same God. Fucking weirdo shit man.",
            "It is culty. Even if they don't force you, it is. You could be punished if you did not both stand and hold your hand over your heart while saying it every morning. It depends on the school of course. Some don't enforce it as much as others\n\n\nI only saw kids get in trouble in kindergarten/first grade. Later on I don't recall anyone getting in trouble for it but everyone did seem obliged to do it anyway despite no one really caring.",
            "Yeah, it's culty. Even more weird that the \"under God\" bit was added way later.",
            "In Australia they would make us sing national anthems and the school pledge every assembly. It's not just the USA that does weird shit like this.",
            "Yes, daily. DAILY.",
            "The funny thing is the pledge was just a marketing ploy by a baptist socialist dude to sell flags to every classroom in the US in the 1800s.  The Founding Fathers would have found the idea of a forced pledge of loyalty to be the complete opposite of what they stood for.  \nhttps://people.howstuffworks.com/culture-traditions/national-traditions/pledge-allegiance.htm",
            "Most but not all, yes. But it\u2019s not expected to mean anything; the kids don\u2019t pay attention to the words. I didn\u2019t put any thought into parsing them until I was in my teens. It\u2019s certainly not supposed to be *binding* or anything. \n\nIt\u2019s just tradition for tradition\u2019s sake. Dumb, but I\u2019ve yet to meet someone who thinks it should be taken seriously as a real \u201cpledge.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s weird, but it\u2019s not really thought of as anything other than \u201cjust the routine.\u201d",
            "Depends on where you're at (we only did it on elementary) and yeah it is. It's not like most kids actually pay attention to what they're reciting since most don't know what its even about. Do you not do this as an adult? \n\nEvery country is a cult. There's levels to it.",
            "Every. Single. Day. It's a morning routine in a lot of schools.",
            "I haven't been a student for about 20 years, so I don't speak for the children of today. When I was a kid, we said the pledge every day, as early as kindergarten. We were so young and it was part of a greater set of new experiences (school itself) that we all just took it as part of the routine. Personally, I had very little understanding of what it even meant, and just mindlessly repeated it. For the first two years or so I thought the phrase \"for which it stands\" was. \"for Richard Stantz,\" who I just assumed was a civil rights hero or something.  \n \nBy high school I still stood for the pledge but stopped reciting it, but not out of protest exactly--I just noticed that the our teacher didn't expect us to (some teachers didn't even stand themselves). In middle school, I had a classmate who conscientiously refused to say or stand for the pledge. I shamefully admit that at the time, I thought it was a little fussy--\"just do it, what's the big deal?\" I had thought. But I, and no other students or even teachers, ever gave him trouble for it. Much later in life, I reflected on this and realized how the daily pledge was both ineffective (it was an automatic ritual that wasn't taken to heart or even consciously thought of) and arguably effective (I didn't question the pledge and, for a time, balked at those who did).  \n \n \nFunnily enough, I *did* balk at the national anthem at sports games and certain call-and-response prayers in church--probably because neither were ingrained at a very early age or done on a daily basis.",
            "I never cared much about religious stuff like God. I just replaced that word with Satan whenever I did the pledge of allegiance in school.",
            "Yes and in hindsight it was pretty culty",
            "Yes. It's like working for Hydra.",
            "Yes although there is no requirement to actually perform the pledge. As a teacher I have never done it and generally the half of the class that even pays attention to it just mumbles through it so no one really cares.\n\nYou're right though it's incredibly creepy and hypocritical when we complain about other countries brainwashing their citizens with no self-reflection. Personally for me though it's more about not feeling any pride for this country as of late.",
            "When I was in elementary and middle school, we did the pledge of allegiance every Monday with the entire school and we\u2019d stand outside in the recreational area of our school ground. They had it over the loud speaker too. If we didn\u2019t do the pledge or goofed off with our friends (like children do) we would be disciplined with detention, or after school gym scraping. In highschool, it was more chill. I don\u2019t recall ever doing it. But every Friday football game during the halftime show, we had an aspiring choir kid sing the national anthem and we\u2019d all stand up and stay quiet. National anthem is much more normal than the pledge of allegiance though. Possibly irrelevant info: Attended public school in CA",
            "I don\u2019t understand the beef with this. It\u2019s about unity to one\u2019s country and patriotism. That\u2019s the goal of every country\u2019s national anthem. I don\u2019t think this is unique to the US either, but it is common in schools as the US has a very patriotic culture. I don\u2019t find anything wrong with teaching people and especially young people that they are apart of the country through pledging the flag. Allows people and young people know at a young age that your neighbor should not be a stranger, they are a fellow citizen whom you should look out for.",
            "pledge allegiance, but yes. and yes.",
            "Depends on the school. Some do, some don\u2019t. It\u2019s more ceremonial than literal, you\u2019re not like legally bound by saying it.",
            "It was started to push flag sales. Nothing more America than that",
            "Yes, all together in unison. Yes, it does sound like a cult. Yes, I don't actually say it anymore. Just go through the motions.",
            "It's funny how we have separation of church and state, yet some people treat the flag like it's a religion.",
            "Yeah, I\u2019ve always found the pledge of allegiance to be an odd and uniquely American thing. I am from the US, born and raised, and I have yet to hear of another country with a pledge of allegiance.",
            "Yes\u2026at least 20 years ago they did. \n\nMy dad told me I didn\u2019t have to and told me that if I wanted to say it I didn\u2019t have to say the \u201cunder god\u201d part. \n\nIf I had kids, I\u2019d tell them not to. Why you ask? Because it American not everyone has equal rights and this definitely isn\u2019t a \u201cfree\u201d country.",
            "Yep... and if you go to Christian school you get to pledge allegiance to the Christian flag, and the Bible. Three... every f-ing day.",
            "Yes.\n\nWe have the Constitutional right not to, but I did it because I didn\u2019t know that then and because I didn\u2019t want to seem weird(er).\n\nNevertheless, I never said the \u201cunder God\u201d part (I\u2019m an atheist).",
            "I was taught in school that evolution and global warming were lies designed to discriminate against Christians. In science class. And yeah, also swore allegiance to the American flag. My hometown was 10/10 a cult.",
            "It honestly depends on the school. \n\nIn Elementary - Middle School we did. But it was optional.",
            "Yes. And it is culty. And no you can't legally be punished for not saying it. Yes you're punished if you don't.",
            "\u201cAnd to the REPUBLIC, for which it stands!\u201d... \n\nAnyone else remember that line?",
            "Yes. Right before active shooter drills.",
            "Yes. It is a cult",
            "Yes. And yes, it is. America needs to realize it\u2019s not the 50\u2019s and we don\u2019t have to assert our superiority over the godless Commies anymore.",
            "What do you mean by that?\n\nDo they say it? Yes\n\nDo they mean it? Probably not which is why most classrooms sound like mumbled murmurs of the pledge. \n\nBut yes, very culty, we prefer our indoctrination to start young",
            "It felt like it was more in remembrance of the people before me who sacrificed everything.  That is what I got out of it.  Definitely not cult like.",
            "In Texas we would turn to the Texas flag and swear allegiance to that one too. We were also reminded occasionally that Texas was the only state allowed to fly their flag at the same height as the US flag.",
            "When I was in school it was \"Pledge\" not \"Swear\"",
            "Also fun fact, texas has its own pledge of allegiance, so in texas public school we had to say the US pledge and then the texas one. I didn\u2019t realize this was not normal until I went to college",
            "Honestly, I always kind of liked it. It makes the point that the flag stands for \"liberty and justice for all\" and the ideals of the Republic, so if you pay attention to the actual words, it's more than empty flag worship. The United States is basically held together culturally by this kind of indoctrination - we don't have a shared ethnic history to define our identity, as the European nations do. It's democratic ideology that makes you an American. Until Trump, that is - he and his ilk are trying to give us a Euro-style ethnic identity, maybe so they can pretend those core values don't matter.\n\nI heard that the God thing got shoe-horned in there by anti-Communists in the 50s, could do without that creepy part since it doesn't fit.\n\nEdit: which is interesting, since it was originally written by a socialist (Francis Bellamy) - from Wikipedia:\n\n\"Bellamy's original Pledge read:\n\nI pledge allegiance to my Flag and the Republic for which it stands, one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\\[1\\]\\[24\\]\n\nThe Pledge was supposed to be quick and to the point. Bellamy designed it to be recited in 15 seconds. As a socialist, he had initially also considered using the words equality and fraternity\\[22\\] but decided against it.\"\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pledge\\_of\\_Allegiance",
            "A cult removes your identity until its the only thing you are. The way we did it was more of a respect thing. We remember those who died and what they fought for, especially because my grandfathers have fought in the wars since the revolution. That's how it was explained to me.",
            "My youngest hated doing so in school. Shes a deeper thinker than I am.",
            "I never even thought about it till recently.  Yes, we had to pledge allegiance to the American flag.  We are also supposed to stand with our hand over our heart when an American flag passes by during a parade.  It does sound like a cult.  It's been bothering me.  If we are free, why do we do it?",
            "Every morning from age 5-18 in school. Across the country. We would stand during the announcements, place our right hand over our heart, and recite in unison:\n\n\u201cI pledge allegiance, to the flag, of the United States of America. And to the Republic, for which it stands, on nation, under God. Indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\u201d\n\nI remember our elementary school principal tore us a new one (I think grade 5?) because a few students in my class replaced some of the words with nonsensical ones. She screamed at us, took away recess for a week, and wrote a letter to all of our parents about respecting the flag and our founding fathers.",
            "The school I teach at doesn't do the pledge at all. Just the other day my students and I dissected the words (we are studying argumentative essays) and they gave a collective \"nah miss\".",
            "This question has been asked at least 1000 times on this sub.  You're not progressive or edgy.",

            "Took me a long time to realize I didn't want to say it- and I'm pretty obnoxious in my \"standing up for what I believe\" attitude \n\nWhen my son started school I didn't say much at first cuz he was 5 lol but when he started back after they were shut down for the pandemic I was like look, dude, you don't have to say this. Listen to these words and decide if you want to say it. You don't have to make a big deal- you can even pretend you're saying it- but I'll back you up. (He is very shy and wouldn't want the attention of sitting quietly) \n\nHe just told me he never says it but he stands. \n\nWhen I worked for Girl Scouts we had a meeting once where we all stood and we were dosed to say the pledge and the GS promise- the woman asked to lead it just calmly said \"oh I don't say that- but I'll lead the promise if you want\" and it was totally no big deal. \n\nMade me realize not everywhere is as weird about it as high school.",
            "Yep. It's incredibly culty and It's just one step to indoctrinating us all into a life of compliance and following orders.",
            "Anyone else think this is brainwashing/propaganda?",
            "Yes, to the flag and to the republic for which it stands.",
            "It wasn't until I was in college talking about it to international students that I realized how insane it is. At the time I abstained from the \"under god\" part of it, but otherwise went along with it to avoid punishment and ostracism.",
            "yes, and under god too. So sucks if your atheistic, polythesist, or spiritualist.\n\nEDIT: i think spiritualist might be something different, and what i was thinking of was Animism.",

            "Do Muslims really pray 5 times a day?\n\nSeems kind of cult-y...amiiright?",
            "We are supposed to say it daily. I typically just 'forget' and blame it on wanting to maximize teaching time. Not one child in 8 years has complained or asked to say it. That being said our state leaders push it hard. One of the places I may have to give in eventually to keep in good graces at my job. The few time 'we' have said it, I am the only person who does. I also typically like to follow the pledge with a shirt reading from a reformer or activist from someone connected to my community.",
            "Our teacher could not care less whether we do it or not",
            "It isn't legally required for them to do so, most of the time the younger kids do it just because an adult told them to and it's part of a morning public school routine. But by the time we get to high school most of the kids are sitting down in their chairs and ignoring it lol. But I will say it both depends on the state and individual experience, so other people's pov's might be different. But I do know it's a constitutional right not to be forced to, some teachers in deep red states might try to punish the student for it but I'm pretty sure if they make a stink about it and point that out (preface by saying they shouldn't HAVE to) they'd get out of trouble.",

            "When I was in public elementary school in New Jersey, circa 1961, after the Pledge the teacher led us all in prayer. Failure to comply earned you a trip to the Principal's office. \n\nAfter SCOTUS ruled that mandatory prayer was unconstitutional, we only had the pledge. When a student asked why reciting the 23rd Psalm was not allowed, but saying \"Under God\" was mandatory, he was sent to the Principal's office.",

            "It's peer pressured into you and part of a daily routine of a USA school. However the ACLU has pushed back against this and technically you can opt out if you want to deal with the bullying and peer pressure.

            "Yup. You can ask to not participate or stay sitting down in a large crowd. Ive come to find it as a joke. \n\nIn some places you can be punished for not doing it. Such as schools in places like texas or florida. I remember my brother got sent home once because he didnt want to, and argued with a teacher about it. \n\nAnd yes, very culty.",
            "It's encouraged, sometimes strongly, but it's not legally required. Kids can stay seated, or stand silently if they want to. A previous supreme court decision allowed that.\n\nIt is very cultish though. Even as a kid, I thought it was weird and rarely participated.\n\nEdit: I also work in a middle school, and they only do it about once a week here anyways. Maybe it's a regional thing though.",

            "I think it depends on whether you go to public or private school and where you live. I remember doing it in public school in the 80s and 90s, but I never had to do it when I went to private school. I also went to public school in Berkeley, California in the 90\u2019s just before I switched to private and I can\u2019t remember having to do it there.

I never have which always put me in trouble in school but I always sat quiet until i reached highschool when my teachers and principal asked why and simply replied america is filled with hypocrisy.

They tried to suspend and expell me and i contacted my uncle who worked at the board of education and was friends with the boss. And there was a whole case. So ever since then in my highschool they made it an option to either pledge the allegiance or to stay quiet and be respectful to those who did and was never much of an issue afterwards.",

            "According to my American husband, yes. And I think it is cult-y, too. I was never ask to swear the allegiance to flag in my home country.",
            "The lead a pledge of allegiance, but there have been Supreme Court cases that reaffirm that no citizen is ever required to take a loyalty oath. \n\nI was born and raised in the US. I view my relationship with my country the same way that I view a job. I\u2019ll play by the rules, do my part, and take advantage of every benefit that I am offered.\n\nBut if I get a better offer somewhere else, I\u2019ll definitely be putting in my two week\u2019s notice and heading out.",
            "Yes and to the USA and to the republic for which it stands.",
            "Interesting to see so many people say its optional. When I was in highschool (around 2006) it was technically optional, but teachers would argue with you and the kids would give you shit if you sat down. There was a muslim girl in my grade who wouldn't participate; everyone, including teachers, harassed her for it. I started to sit too in support and it did not help lol they just harrassed both of us.",
            "This sounds like brainwashing...",
            "I went to a private catholic school and we had pledge allegiance and say prayers every single day while standing. I remember being called out for sitting down or not saying it. I had teachers who understood that it was okay, but I got threatened and got detention a few times by the strict ones.",
            "Where i live everyone has to sing the national athem before starting clases.... it was anyoning and most of the time i just skiped it.",

I worked at an inner city high school in 2020 and not a single kid stood up, which I think is a good thing. It\u2019s dumb as hell to pledge allegiance to a piece of fabric.",
            "We didn\u2019t really do this in my classes growing up.  Maybe a few times at like big events and we learned it.  But We were not forced to participate.  We have a constitutional right to freedom of speech, including not speaking.",
            "Doesn't matter. Talk about anything negative/criticism on the US and you will hear it. It's definitely 'culty' whether people admit it, swear to the flag or not. The US definitely has a big upstanding for its country",
            "/r/AskAnAmerican is a great subreddit if you are curious about the USA. This sub works too, but just letting you know.",

            "Yes, this question has been asked and answered many times before and many times this week as well, I wish redditors learned how to use the search function.\n\nTo reiterate things already stated in previous threads\n\n1) it's not only the US that does this\n\n2) It is totally optional and not legally required though when I went to school you may receive odd looks from your classmates. To be frank you appear to be \"THAT\" guy \n\n3) It is a pledge not a swear\n\n4) In Texas you do both the texas flag and US tho its again optional.  \n\nI don't know why this seems so weird anyways don't they do this at most major sporting events too?",
            "Since 5 years old yes and it\u2019s required",
            "If by \"swear\" you mean \"pledge\", then yes. But as we've learned the past couple of weeks, \"pledge\" is the same as \"donate\", so yes, American children donate allegiance to the flag.",
            "Everything is a cult if you even barely scratch the surface. But yes, as an American it\u2019s one of the largest failed cults ever. Nationalism died about 20 years ago over here and only people over 50 fall for that shit any more generally. Minus the obvious outliers. You\u2019re always gonna have a few Alex Jones\u2019 drinking their own flavor aid. (I chose flavor aid because it was the actual brand used in the Jonestown massacre and I refuse to disparage the glory that is kool-aid with malicious false sayings.)",
            "no one means it when they say it",
            "The pledge of allegiance is a pledge, not really a swearing.\n\nBut also, not really, it's just a thing you do, it doesn't mean anything outside of indoctrination.",
            "Yes, and people looked at me weird when I moved from another country and finished high school here and didn't pledged allegiance. Not my flag.",
            "Kids being forced to say the pledge in schools pre-WW2 is even funnier. Back then, you would give the \"Bellamy salute\" while you said it. And then hitler came along and ruined the Bellamy salute. I was in school 1970-1982 and we never did the pledge."

            "It seems in the current generation there are a huge amount of people that dont want to have children.",
            "[deleted]",
            "Yes, your life your decision",
            "Yes, especially I think nowadays with how easy it is to find information online- it makes it easier to realise just how hard raising a kid can be so more people are making informed decisions",
            "This is the advice I gave my daughter when she asked. If you do not have a very strong desire to have children, if it is not something you think about, yearn for, pray for and can't live without, don't do it. You're not having babies. You are having toddlers, teens and adults. It is perfectly okay and normal to feel that children have no place in your life. It is not something some people just naturally want.",
            "Absolutely. I think the previous generations believed you werent a true adult unless you had a kid. Now a days with costs of living being so high and the world looking so bleak it's made many younger millennials second guess having kids. They're definitely not for everyone.",
            "Yeah. It\u2019s normal to have 0 interest or intention on kids. Society will tell you otherwise but yeah, totally normal.",
            "My life is stressful enough without having to worry about a child\u2019s future 24/7. There are enough people in this world anyway. Live how you want to, it\u2019s your prerogative.",
            "I am someone who don't have any interest or intention on having a kid.Let's just say \"normality\" is an abstract concept. I would define it by what the majority of people do. If you consider that point of view, then you might not be \"normal\".\n\nFor example, I don't sound like someone \"normal\" to my family or to other random people. For them, having a kid is normal. Having a kid is somewhat a goal in life that everyone must complete. However, when you ask them \"why?\", they'll answer : \"well, it's like that\". To me, that answer doesn't sound anything like \"normal\", it sounds like \"conditioned\".\n\nSo, in this case, it's not about being normal or not. You don't have a kid the same way you buy a car. It has to be a thoughtful decision. No one's forcing you so if you don't feel like doing it, just don't.Yes, you won't sound like normal to other people but hey, that's something you don't decide just because \"it's like that\". If you want to have a kid, then do. If you don't, then don't.\n\nAs simple as that.",
            "Some people don't realize they want kids until they have them, others don't realize they don't want to have kids until they have them lol\n\nOur species is growing quick enough that no one has to be pressured into having kids, so if you don't want any, that's totally fine!",
            "I was just thinking about this the other day. I have no interest in being a parent but I also am jealous that all these other people experience the want to have kids. Like I\u2019m a lil broken. But I still don\u2019t want them.",
            "Given the current state of the world.. im not surprised that people in my age have a higher rate of not willing to be parents.",
            "Absolutely. My main reason is that whether rich or poor, beautiful or ugly, smart or dumb, my children will inevitably experience suffering. But not if they aren't born.",
            "I am someone who doesn't wanna give birth to a baby, but prefer adopting a kid. I have met a few amazing men in my life, but everyone wants a biological kid. It's disheartening to find your type of man only to part ways because of this one reason, even though it's a major one!",
            "Define \"normal\".  If you want kids, have them.  If you don't, don't.  There's nothing inherently wrong with either scenario really.  Just keep in mind at your young age folks are going to repeatedly say you're going to change your mind.  And you very well could, guess what, it's your decision. :)  But, as a gen X person who chose not to have children, for me there's no regret like people were always telling me.",
            "Yes. The problem is that our families generally assume we're going to have a \"normal life\" and raise us with that expectation... marry someone of the opposite sex, have two kids etc. If it wasn't drilled into us as kids we wouldn't have such a hard time realizing there are other completely valid ways of having a life as adults.",
            "Honestly this planet needs more people who don't want kids.",
            "Totally normal, plenty of reasons not too.  The world is a shit show atm, raising a child can be expensive and stressful,  or even if you just plain dont like kids.  Dont let people pressure you into living the life they think you want.",
            "Yes. The contrary is simply societal pressure",
            "These questions keep popping up recently...\n\nYes its fine. Dont get pressured into having any if you dont want to. Not by your spouse nor by your family. \n\nThere are a lot of reasons to not want any and every single one is okay",
            "I've worked at a pet store in the past. You'd be surprised at how many people come into that store and want to buy a bearded dragon without doing the slightest bit of research. It was policy to educate, and if they balked at the price of lights or the years that they would have to take care of this critter for, plus the mass amounts of food they would have to provide, that we would not sell them a critter. \nI think of kids as pets now more than ever. Some people are not good pet owners. They don't do the research they need to provide that critter with a happy life, they provide shotty training, poor quality food, not enough vet check ups, and as a result they end up having another problem adult in the world with little to no idea of how to be a good parent to their own pets.",
            "I wanted to have kids, but as I got older and saw how shitty the world is I realized having a kid wouldn\u2019t be the best decision. Also I wouldn\u2019t want to have a baby mother that I\u2019m not married to and even if we were married, 50% of marriages end up in divorce. So taking that risk doesn\u2019t seem appealing. Not to mention how expensive the cost of living is nowadays.",
            "Yes, tradition is just peer pressure from dead people.",
            "Yes, it is. I personally know at least three different couples that have no intent on having kids. It\u2019s becoming more and more popular.\n\nI also don\u2019t want kids. I think they\u2019re loud and annoying, expensive, and not worth any of the hassle.\n\nAlso, if it matters, kids are environmentally unfriendly just because people are not environmentally friendly. More people means an unhealthy environment even if they are as green as they could possibly be by recycling and reusing their waste and only using public transportation.",
            "Yes. Don't let society pressure you otherwise.",
            "I'm 28 and have my tubal ligation coming up. One of the reasons I married my husband is because he also doesn't want children. He's open to adopting which was another reason I said yes. I think our generation and the younger ones have made it normal so it doesn't feel any different than many couples we meet that are also childless. \n\nAside from our beliefs on the world, my main reason is my upbringing. My mother constantly told my sisters and I that she prays we have children so we can know the true meaning of suffering, pain, and regret. Well guess what? None of my sisters are having kids either. And now my mother has the audacity to ask why we have forsaken giving her grandchildren.",
            "Normal: yes\n\nSocially Acceptable: no\n\nI am 42, child-free,  no regrets.",
            "My view on it is that there\u2019s really no point. \n\nMost people talk about working hard and saving money to give their kids a better life, but from my perspective in 20 years from now the earth is gonna be in a state where better life isn\u2019t a option",
            "It's normal, but oh my god do people bug you for it...\n\nI don't want kids and I'm hoping to have a vasectomy soon. This fact offended the majority of my family. Why? \"We want grandkids!\"\n\nPeople have kids for selfish reasons, some don't, but some do.\n\nI for one don't want to bring any life into this world with an impending apocalypse on the horizon by 2040-2060. Food shortages, water wars, resource depletion, and so on. I will likely live to see modern human civilization collapse. Thus, I think bringing kids into the world is selfish since they will suffer to a higher degree than I would.\n\nPlus, I'm pretty apathetic to our species continuing. We've had enough time to get our shit together and we've failed. Our tribalism has been our downfall along with our false self importance and giant ego.",
            "Yeah, I think it's for the best honestly. Between automation taking away jobs and the economy and environment not looking so good, it's probably for the best that most people don't have kids.\n\nAs someone said in a similar thread the other day: \"Having kids is either an economic need for farmers, a mistake, or a commodity for the wealthy\".",
            "Yes. I personally think the obsession with reproducing to be odd.",
            "I am worried about future climate change, lack of social safety nets, hard to buy house as millennial, expensive education, expensive healthcare, decreasing regulations for infrastructure, future water scarcity, food scarcity due to water scarcity, and ever increasing job market competitiveness, so on and on. At this point, hard to think of any positives for future gen other than being a corporate slave",
            "I have 0 interest. I'm getting shirts made that say \"cats not kids\" because I'm tired of people asking when we're having them",
            "With the availability of birth control, the financial cost of childcare or a single-income family, climate change creating the threat of an unsafe future, and the fact that not everyone desires giving decades their life to the care for another person/people, yeah.",
            "Yes, check out r/childfree. My father recently told me he is going to take me out of his will if I don\u2019t have kids. My response: ok go ahead",
            "Yes - and don't let people tell you you'll regret it. My partner and I never wanted children and we've never regretted it. If it turns out later in life that you have the urge to do a bit of parenting you can always do some volunteering or something. Personally I find children annoying and the further I keep away from them the better.",
            "I'm in my 50's and I never wanted children. I like kids and I'm glad my siblings have them. I just never felt the desire to be a mother. No regrets!",
            "Yes. In fact, the people that need to justify anything are the people who are having kids. They had better have a damn good reason because unlike child free people, their decisions effect other people.",
            "If i can barelly make enough for myself i sure as hell won't be having any kids.",
            "It\u2019s always annoying to me how the brainwashed parents and ones who aren\u2019t fit to be parents always have the most amount of kids.",
            "completely normal",
            "Completely normal.",
            "I never wanted kids. I have 2 now and I still don\u2019t want kids.",
            "Yes.",
            "Yes",
            "Yes. Don\u2019t let anyone shame you for it, because it\u2019s your life and your personal business, nobody else\u2019s.",
            "Just realize that wanting kids is also on the spectrum of normal. Don't get sucked into the pro-kid or anti-kid cults. You do you, they can do them.\n\nMy two cents is kids can be fun and cute, but they also monopolize your time and budget and take over your life. That being said, I have a kid, but my wife and I were in our 30s before we wanted one. For me, it was about wanting to do things with my life before being tied down. For her, it was about wanting independence and not ever being with someone before that she thought would be a good child-rearing partner.\n\nIn retrospect, there was more stuff in life I should have done first, so too soon. My wife's perspective is we started a few years too late. It is what it is.\n\nWe have plenty of friends all over the spectrum: have kids and love it, have kids and regretted it, no kids and no SO and loving or hating it, no kids but have SO and loving or hating it, and single parents and loving or hating it \n\nWhat I hate seeing is unhappy people. Do what makes you happy, and don't let anyone give you crap about it.",
            "Even if it wasn't normal, who the hell cares about being normal all the time. Normal is boring as fuck.",
            "Yeah! Absolutely",
            "Yes it\u2019s normal. My take is if you\u2019re not 100% yes about having kids, then that\u2019s a NO.     \nBecause once you have them you can\u2019t take it back. If there\u2019s any doubt, don\u2019t do it.",
            "Fuck yea. Never wanted a kid. For a small moment when I got pregnant once I felt sentimental but still knew that it wasn\u2019t for me. Fuck the advice like \u201cyou\u2019ll feel different when you get older\u201d. Some people just know.",

Been hearing people say I'll change my mind some day, still can't see myself trading freedom, money, weed, all the videogames I could possibly want, going out or even traveling at a moments notice, and so much more, for the chance of spending money on mountains of diapers, having to change those diapers, waking up several times every night, being worried the little fella will die or.get sick  because I fucked up somehow, wasting money for years on pointless education, then seeing the little shit growing up to hate me, become a tiktoker and play Fortnite on a ps7.

A lot of people's interests and intentions change as they age.  I've known people who chose not to have children and lived perfectly happy lives.  But I've also known a few couples who chose not to, and then sat there looking at each other when they were seventy wishing they had something of value and purpose in their life other than TV and bridge with their elderly friends.

Sounds like having children is the worst can happen to a human being.. wow, humanity,  you don't seem to make it too far.  Let's all replace children with pets and call them our babies instead.

I'm sure that the woman receiving the compliment knows that a 4 year old is not being racist because she complimented her pouffy hair. If an adult said that it might be misconstrued even if it was a nice comment but a 4 year old that likes big hair is not going to be considered racist. Your wife may have been uncomfortable on behalf of herself with the comment your daughter made but I don't think that anyone should be worried. Your wife is very kind to feel self conscious about how the comment was taken but as an outsider I think your wife just needs to relax and remember kids are kids and teach them what you will...",

Plus, by now I\u2019d expect white adults to realize the specific comments about black women\u2019s hair are interpreted as microaggressions most of the time.

            "When I was very young, my dad and I were standing in line behind a black lady who had long, beautiful cornrows to her waist. (I remember none of this, it's something my dad told me.) He said I was fascinated, and finally asked, very loudly, if my hair could look like that someday. He laughed and told me my hair would probably never look like that. The lady turned around to see what was going on, and my dad just shrugged and said, \"White kid from the suburbs.\" The lady laughed and laughed, then bent down to let me see/touch it. (This was mid-80s, somewhere outside Detroit.) Most reasonable adults can tell the difference between a kid being curious about something different from them, and a kid who has been taught hate. A 4yo is pretty innocent of all that, they're just learning the difference between red and green; skin color isn't much different, and they only know the historical connotations if they've been taught. In my experience, at least. Nothing wrong with addressing it, but I really hope Mom didn't discourage the curiosity. Curiosity breeds understanding, and understanding is the very basis of cultural acceptance.",

            "There are a lot of layers to this because your wife has decided to make race a big piece of this, and you have decided that any compliment is okay due to the intent behind your daughter's words. We all know a 4 y/o will not have ill intent behind their compliments.\n\nHere is my question for you: if your daughter approached someone and said \"I love your belly! It's so round!\" What would be your next steps? Also, to points against your wife, does race *really* play a role in educating your daughter here? I have big naturally curly hair. While I am not offended by a child calling my hair \"poofy\", I definitely would be thinking about my frizz level for the rest of the day! Lol\n\nIt's completely okay for your daughter to compliment someone, BUT it is your job as parents to guide your children to understand what is an appropriate compliment and what is not, intent being second in command. No one is going to get offended by a 4 year old. But it's good to remember that one day your 4 year old will be a 16 year old going to school with people who look different than her. 4 years old is as good of a time as any to educate her (age appropriately) about how calling someone's hair \"pouffy\" may not be as nice as she thought. \n\nJust my two cents!",

            "Pouffy coming from a 4 year old is sweet. Appreciate your wife trying to teach consideration and respect though! That is equally as sweet.

Now, it becomes a chance to teach her that while we can find other people\u2019s bodies interesting and attractive or amazing, there\u2019s better ways to compliment them.\n\nChildren first start noticing racial differences between the ages of 4 and 5 yr old, and children of color recognize differences on the earlier end of this. This is a great time to start introducing your daughter to the fact that, yes, no one is exactly the same and that\u2019s a good thing. \n\nThere are some great books out there for young children and how to they can note these differences and be appreciative and comfortable with them.\n\nIn effect, neither of you were ideally correct\u2026your wife heard an innocent (even kind) comment and ascribed a negative to it that a child was incapable of fully understanding. Your impulse was to dismiss this, as though these differences don\u2019t matter and aren\u2019t something to mention. However, racial differences do exist, and if nothing else, society does treat people differently.

All the white \"woke\" people found it offensive, while the Mexicans thought it was cool.\n\nOr when the 1932 film Freaks came out, people protested the film because they thought it was exploitive to people with disabilities.  The \"freak shows\" pretty much ended in the US for this reason as well, yet if you talked to these people, they didn't want people to come to their rescue.  They found a niche that made them a good living and it was shut down.\n\nTrying not to offend people is not necessarily a bad thing.  It comes from a good place.  But I think we need to have more open discussions with people to find out what they consider offensive.  \n\nIf that black woman loved her pouffy hair, it might be offensive to say that it's offensive to call it pouffy.\n\nCultures are constantly evolving.

I think you're wife is fine, yes it's just a compliment and I doubt anyone would be offended but people on here aren't a spokesperson for their whole race or group of people and it's important to teach kids young that there are correct ways to compliment and there are bad ways to compliment.

            "Retired 911 dispatcher here to say she is breaking numerous laws (federal, state, and employment) which she is 100% aware of as she has to sign an annual, legally binding document explicitly stating she will not do exactly this (most especially the looking up people.) She is going to get fired, and will most likely be prosecuted for more than one federal felony if the investigation uncovers that she\u2019s done this *even once*. \n\nThank you for not being ok with her behavior, thank you for asking for advice, and thank you for protecting the public from the threat that she most certainly is. Her employer needs to be notified, and it is 100% best that you **do not** provide *any* information to anyone in dispatch. Call their non-emergency number (you\u2019ll get a dispatcher, do not tell them anything) and request to speak with the on-duty supervisor regarding filing a formal complaint against an employee of the department. At this point, it is illegal for the dispatcher to ask why/who/what for or to pressure you in any way. They may transfer you immediately, or need to call you back (depending on how large their department is/if they have a department or officer dedicated to handling complaints/or due to volume/type of incidents they\u2019re handling at the time of your call), or they may ask you to come in in person. They\u2019ll want your phone number, but you can request to remain anonymous and most agencies will not require more given the nature of your call. They will 100% want to know so even if you meet resistance at any point initially, be firm, confident, calm, and consistent in stating that you will only speak with the on-duty supervisor/watch commander.\n\n**Make sure not to call while your friend is on duty.**\n\nThe department will be required to have an external agency investigate/do an audit, and that agency will notify all appropriate governing bodies about any violations. There are systems in place at every LE agency to deal with exactly this sort of situation, and they will be far better equipped to handle contacting whoever needs to be contacted than an individual citizen. \n\nIf, for *any* reason, this department is so podunk that you\u2019re concerned about it being covered up, or if you are refused a meeting (either by phone or in person) or are forced to provide the specific reason for your call by anyone other than the watch commander/supervisor, simply hang up, and contact a separate, parallel county or state agency. \n\nAnd again, thank you for taking this next step. What she\u2019s doing is a gross violation (ethically and legally) and you are inarguably correct in reporting her. She needs to be stopped, like yesterday.",

The squirrels were a bit wary, but everytime I went out it would take them less and less time to approach. One day, I went out in the afternoon, and the squirrel would not approach, instead remaining on his perch up on the fence. I realized it might have been because I was wearing jeans and a green T-shirt. They may have become accustomed to taking food from a fuzzy blue me. I tested it a couple days later, going out in the afternoon wearing my bathrobe, and what do you know? A squirrel came up for a peanut.",
            "Different clothes is on the checklist of things you need to socialise puppies to before they are three months old or so, or it might freak them out as adults, because they _do_ \"change\" how people look. A man in a puffy coat might look like he is huge and looming threateningly, sunglasses might make faces look scary and \"inhuman\" and so on. If they are exposed to it as puppies, they know it's just normal human stuff.\n\nI don't think dogs understand what clothes are \"for\". Dogs live their entire lives surrounded by things they don't understand, they are used to it. They just vibe.\n\nEdit: Thinking about it, there is lots of stuff in my daily surroundings I don't know the purpose for, but it's just normal and not that interesting so I don't ever really think about it.",

We all wore socks and slippers in the house those first few months and then when summer rolled around would walk around bare foot. The dog absolutely lost his mind the first time seeing our feet, whining and sniffing and licking at them. We think he thought we had had our paws skinned or something, but he got used to it after a few days.",
            "I would say so. Dogs will react to a human that wears something similar to a human that they fear or were harmed by.  I had a neighbor's dog who would freak out if it saw me with a bandana on my head, but like clark kent and glasses, the minute I removed it, the dog treated me like a completely different person. \n\nMy dog was never harmed, but I remember the very few times I undressed in front of him, he just stood there confused.

Whenever I go visit my family house, my parents' puppers get all excited and tippy-tappy whenever I get out of my daily clothes and don my sweatpants and oversized hoodie, cause they know it means I'm gonna stick around a while. Conversely, they get all sad and sigh-y when I change out of them and into my \"leaving\" attire. \nOur youngest had even developed a habit of stealing and hiding my socks in a desperate attempt to prevent me from going to work, a couple years ago.\n\nSame goes with when they see my dad donning his woodworking uniform: they'll instantly zoom out in the garden, all happy and playful, cause there's nothing they love more than napping in the shade while my old man carves his umpteenth wooden spoon, lol.\n\nDogs are happiness incarnate.",

With each other, you may notice they really don't \"talk\" vocally, and especially don't meow at each other. There are examples to the contrary, of course, but this is the norm. \n\nI've also noticed that my cats will respond to me differently depending on what I'm wearing, and they especially do not like hats. When the head silhouette changes, it puts them on edge. I'm pretty sure they view clothing the way they view their own physical displays (whiskers oriented forward or back, ears held high or pressed back against their head, stomach exposed or back arched, etc). They think it's us communicating physically. This seems to be especially true with my feral cats, where as the ones I've raised from kittens seem far better socialized to human behaviors and don't react nearly the same way.",

            "Having grown up on a farm I can assure everyone all animals will need help birthing sometimes! I especially note cattle. Egg layers even have problems sometimes have chicks die when unable to break the shell. Birthing usually is a great event but it\u2019s possible for death to be the result.",
            "While animal reproduction is diverse, it is generally true that it is much more painful and dangerous for humans.\n\nWe got these big ol brains, see, and these fat heaps of computing flesh are difficult to fit through even the stretchiest of orifices. So difficult that it is both painful and potentially dangerous to the mother.\n\nHowever, it would seem that the reward is worth the risk. Not only did humans with bigger nogs clearly survive better (causing this evolution to begin with), but it has allowed us to take over our world, so I'd say evolution knew what it was doing (so to speak) when it took us down this path.",

            "Probably because you aren't seeing the animals that don't survive. I cannot speak for wildlife, but I've seen cattle and rodents in former workplaces that were struggling with birth. Some survived and others didn't.   \n\nThe cow I saw struggling was in extreme distress. We called the cowboys and they were able to save her and the calf, but the vultures were lurking. That's how we saw her, there were a bunch of vultures circling her and perched in the trees. They were just waiting for her to die.",
            "So there's a lot of good answers here about anatomy but I just want to throw out there that there's an element of culture and psychology as well. In some cultures, childbirth is generally not a huge deal. Women mentally anticipate that it will be fine, they've seen many other women give birth, they utilize any posture that's comfortable for them, they walk around and move and may have an experienced midwife providing counter pressure for back comfort, etc etc. In America, and in a lot of European history, childbirth has been a very woman-unfriendly experience for ages. Women anticipate a horribly painful traumatic experience, and this has direct consequences on how the body works and in turn actually makes it more painful. Women are required to lay still, flat on their backs, during the entire labor (sometimes), or at the very least they have their movements restricted by various monitors and IVs. They often only have nurses, who have other patients to attend to and aren't necessarily trained to support women so much as they're trained to keep women alive (which is good and I love my nurses so much), and a doctor who shows up right at the end. They're very very often made to or encouraged to lay on their back for birth, pushing uphill with limited movement, so the physician can see what's going on. They're told when to push and for how long. They're surrounded by bright lights, beeping monitors, not allowed to eat or drink. They're on a timeline; if you take too long you're using up bed space. Births that take too long are pushed along by medications like pitocin which create unnaturally painful contractions. This often leads to an epidural which makes you bedridden in most cases, which tends to prolong birth and require more intervention. It just goes on and on.\n\nSo yes, our anatomy makes it harder than it is for like...a horse. But our anxieties make us have an even more painful and longer experience, and our medical set up makes everything worse as well. It *is* worse just because we're humans, but it doesn't need to be like you see on movies. It doesn't have to be awful.\n\nSource: three babies born mostly naturally. Had to do pitocin for my preemie and that birth was the hardest - I also wasn't mentally prepared, I didn't have a single loved one with me, and I was scared for my baby.",
            "It\u2019s not always nice in the animal kingdom. Have you heard of hyenas, sea lice, and kiwis?",
            "There are certain animals that do experience discomfort during birth. Women struggle because we walk upright and the skull and shoulders of infants passing through a small hole is going to be painful no matter how you write it. \n\n\nI don't have kids but my friends, sisters and mom (obviously) all did and I asked them about it. They say the baby doesn't hurt as much as the contractions do. The muscle spasms are the worst. The cervix opening (if it even does) is the worst. Period cramps are pretty brutal so I can't imagine birthing contractions. \n\nAlso animals aren't as vocal as people as well. They're very good at hiding pain or discomfort. No idea why, but they are tougher than we will ever be. When my cat had her babies she barely flinched. You could tell in her eyes she was uncomfortable, and she wanted to be next to me the entire time, but she didn't cry or moan or anything. She just pushed the babies out. She was more confused than anything.",

            "Animals are instinctively quiet when they give birth.  It\u2019s a very vulnerable time for them and their babies in the wild.  It\u2019s hard to tell how much it really affects them.  Of course, as others have said, the pelvis shape aids them as well",
            "Limited options, our failure to recognize an animals pain does not mean that pain doesn't exist, only that our understanding is lacking.\n\nAnimals don't have the luxury to expose their weakness so they deal with it and keep going to survive best way they know how.",

            "Animals can't talk.",
            "Humans have not fully evolved to situation of have bigger heads.\n\nIn all animals, the head size is proportional to the size of the nether regions allowing a newborn to just slip out.  Over the last 100.000 years or so, humans developed a bigger brain, and therefore a bigger head, but the size of the nether regions have not caught up.\n\nWithout human medical capabilities, this would eventually solve itself, and more moms and babies would die in childbirth when  baby head is too big for mom nether region, slowly favoring those with the better proportions for a safe birth - pure darwinism - but humans, with our bigger brain, have found ways around having moms and babies die, so here we are.",
            "My partner just had our first child, 7 weeks ago and she said to me that she\u2019s convinced if it were men who had to give birth and not the women that science would have come up with a better, pain free way of giving birth by now and you know what? I think she\u2019s right.\n\n\nEdit:\nI see I\u2019ve upset some women. I think you\u2019ve misunderstood, it wasn\u2019t meant to say that only men are scientist, the point was that men wouldn\u2019t be able to handle the pain of childbirth as we know it so would ensured a new, painless way was found. \n\nTake your head out your arse long enough and you\u2019ll realise it was a compliment to women and a dig at men.",
            "Asked my wife this very question last night. Her response: to make us think twice whether we want to do it again. It's nature's population control.\n\nWhatever the true answer is, I like this version best.",

            "We learned this in anthropology and it's really neat.\n\n\nBasically humans are so smart, with such large craniums, that our newborns ride the line between killing the mothers during childbirth and not.\n\nHaving your mother die isn't very good for survival, so evolution selected for us to be born quite prematurely, as well. Which explains why most animals can walk  and do the basics of taking care of themselves within a few days of being born, and humans are useless sacks of crap for the first year or more.",
            "So... I don't know if that's really the case.  Those of us in \"Modern  Western Society\u2122\" live a lifestyle that we weren't really meant to live, and I'm certain it takes a toll on how our bodies work.  \n\nI remember watching a documentary about life in a remote village (forgive me I don't know what country it was in) in a lush part of Africa with lots of fresh water and big plants.  Looked like paradise.  The people in this village lived in very simple huts and it seemed like a matriarchal setup.  The part that changed my life was when they showed this lady about to give birth. She was working on whatever and just put down her things, walked over to where the lake was, squatted down for like a couple of minutes, and popped the baby out with little effort.  Cut the cord, washed the baby off in the lake, took a short rest, put the baby in a sling and literally went on about her day like it was nothing.  She had zero help. It was the most hardcore thing I have ever seen and it made me feel like a HUGE PUSSY because way less dramatic things can drag me down.\n\nI want to know why those women have that kind of strength and I feel like such a pile of mush. I can only chalk it up to society ruining our natural processes.",
            "First: bipedism. Our hips are narrower in comparison to those of other primates. That's because we need them smaller to be able to walk and stand.\n\nSecond: our heads are bigger than those of other baby animals... Which doesn't work well with the narrower hips.\n\nThird: the way we give birth is not the most appropriate. Laying in a bed with our legs open and lots of doctors and stress around us makes an already hard job, harder.\n\nLaying down is a popular way of giving birth, but it is not the best. Squatting and standing are way better (in fact the WHO advises against laying down labours), but both of them make it harder for the doctors and we have \"medicalized\" labour to the point the comfort of the doctors is more important than the woman's.\n\nMany women have tried giving birth with less doctors and a calmer ambient, in water, and being able to move around as they need, and they always say it hurts less.\n\nI'm not saying no doctors are needed, because, of course, there should be a doctor to help in case anything goes wrong, which could be lots of things. But the hospital atmosphere is not the most relaxing one, and that increases the pain...\n\nSo yeah, that's basically the reason giving birth hurts so much.",
            "Because doctors are morons that think women should labor on their backs with their feet in the air.\n\nThis common practice is literally the worst way to give birth.",
            "Goddamn sorting by controversial is just people citing Genesis. People, when these are asked, they most likely mean scientifically. I'm not saying your beliefs are invalid, I'm saying that there are also scientific reasons for it. Namely largehead and narrow hips.",

            "I have no scientific proof of this , this is just my opinion, but I think they have a higher pain tolerance than humans. You see videos and pictures with antelope or zebras missing a HUGE chunk of their body, like a whole leg or shoulder muscle or their rear and they\u2019re still grazing away and chilling like it\u2019s nothing .",
            "Learned behaviors\u2026 native women all over the world delivered their children, sometimes in solitary or out of the village. Sure, there can be complications but it\u2019s a mindset as well. Preparation for childbirth requires more than filling out paperwork. Also difficult if you have to work until delivery so you can get the 6-8 weeks disability AFTER the birth to bond with your newborn. \n\nAlso, wish I was told to practice LaMaze breathing when taking a shit-really can\u2019t practice when labor hits & you have to just \u201cdo it\u201d without knowing how or if you\u2019re doing right/wrong.",
            "I think it\u2019s more instinctual for animals to try to be quite when giving birth because it\u2019s a very vulnerable predicament they\u2019re in at the moment and they might be preyed upon if they show signs of distress but it does hurt them.",
            "I have seen plenty of painful animal births on a farm I worked at. I took care of pregnant goats and their babies on a dairy and helped with pigs sometimes too. The mothers would scream and look very uncomfortable while pushing the babies out. Birthing is an experience full of suffering.",
            "Our heads are too big. Compare a baby's head:body ratio with, say, a kitten's. We've got fat fuckin' heads.\n\nAlso, since the advent of caesareans, babies have been getting bigger. This makes sense evolutionarily, as more developed baby = more successful baby, but where once we had a sort of evolutionary limit on the process (how big of a baby could be stuffed out through a human vagina) now there's no cap. People have babies that are too big to be born traditionally and then those babies go on to grow up and breed and have their own even bigger babies.\n\nIt's getting to a point where there's a likely future for humanity in which we are totally reliant on modern medicine for childbirth. We're just going to be producing babies that are flat-out too big to be given birth to. They'll be mandatory c-sections."

High-quality popcorn kernels that DON'T come in any kind of non-air-tight container (such as a plastic bag).
