            "Related: does anyone ever feel sleepy and suddenly hear all sound disappear for a fraction of a second?",
            "I think some people are misunderstanding. If I understand correctly, this is not when you close your eyes and drift off only to wake up hours later but it felt like a second.  Not that sensation. \n\nThis sensation is when you lie there with your eyes closed completely still and you go into this weird half-asleep. You feel conscious the whole time but not entirely. It feels like you're just laying there with eyes closed and your trying to sleep but just cant.  After a while goes by, you open your eyes but feel like you've been awake the whole time but in a kind of trance. Time passes fairly quick but not in an instant. And you open your eyes feeling refreshed almost as if you did sleep.\n\nI know exactly what you mean and I cant figure it out either, pretty uncommon for me but it does happen. I dont take any medications at all except I do smoke weed . Maybe your brain only succeeds in shutting down partially instead of fully?\n\nEdit: something maybe worth mentioning. I dont dream. Ever. Maybe once a month. I kinda like it that way. Makes the night shorter. Whenever I do dream, it feels like the night drags on forever. Then I wake up feeling tired cuz I just had to do a bunch of shit in my dream. Like damn, I cant even rest in my own sleep. \nAnd it's not that I'm forgetting the dreams. I can feel when I just forget them. Usually it just doesnt happen\n\nEdit2: oh my god I cant believe this many people relate. I just woke up to this having 500 something upvotes. Wow.",

The following is a quote from an article about this.\n\u201cIn 1960 the California Highway Patrol started testing with aircraft for traffic spotting. In 1962 helicopters were added.  It wasn't until 1981 that aircraft were used in conjunction with ground units for speed enforcement and aerial observation.\nThe CHP has about 30 aircraft and by 2012, half were used for traffic control.\u201d",

OSHP flies a Cessna (they have several) and use a stopwatch to calculate speed of vehicles traveling between each mark.  Then they send a cruiser to pull you over.  The one car group I'm part of on Facebook has someone that uses the FlightRadar24 app and he pays to monitor the flight plans of certain tail numbers.  Somehow he got the Tail numbers of the planes OSHP uses and he'll post the routes they fly and when.  They definitely use it quite often.",

Timed line to line with a stop watch. Ahead on the highway would be a line of cars waiting. They get the call and down the ramp they go. You don\u2019t see them, you don\u2019t hear them. You just get the cherries from seemingly nowhere. \n\nI saw it once before the program was announced here. I looked over to my side and saw a plane over the fields. I\u2019m like what the hell is that thing doing?  Too high for crop dusting. Too low to be commercial or anything else. Couple minutes later, 10-15 cars waiting. Air enforcement wasn\u2019t known at the time so I was like that was weird, carried on. Week later, article in the paper. All made sense. \n\nApparently they got their business case from Ohio. Learned/trained with them to bring it over. \n\nI haven\u2019t heard or seen any articles in the last bit. They were targeting construction zones for a while. Single lanes, speed drops down to 80 kph, no place for them to sit and wait. The thing in Ontario, 50 over is stunt driving. They take your car away for a week. So going down the highway @ 130 (very normal on the 401), speed suddenly 80, and there\u2019s a plane up above watching.  \n\nRead articles the US patrols the US/Canada border with drones too.  Pretty sure it was the Reaper and Homeland Security. \n\nOPP are playing with drones but not sure how much. For searching, accident reconstruction, things like that. For speed enforcement, it could be viewed as photo radar which is not legal here. That\u2019s slowly changing though (mainly school zones). \n\nSo if you see a plane not too high up, slow the fuck down.",

The officer estimates the speed and uses calibrated radar/VASCAR/ laser to confirm the speed he estimated. That's one of the reasons that is hard to get out of tickets. \n\nYou can question the calibration records of the device, the officer's training and experience, etc. But because the officer's aren't solely relying on the device to measure, is a lot harder once those questions are answered.",

When these subreddits get big, they have a lot of users which means they have the power to get pretty much any post to /r/all they want. When a particuarly good post gets posted (lets use /r/interestingasfuck and /r/Damnthatsinteresting as an example because they are one of the more obvious subjects.) the user who posts wants it to get as much attention as possible (whether for karma, attention, or just because he wants to share something he thought was cool) so he will post it to as many relevant subs as he can. A large portion of the time the post will get upvoted on one sub, but not on another. This happens all the time but you don't notice it because you don't look through that persons post history to see that they've submitted it multiple times to many subreddits. However, sometimes they do get upvoted in both communities. Then this results in the multiple accounts of the same post on the front page. This isn't really a huge problem but it isn't easily fixable due to the segregated nature of reddit as a whole until it reaches /r/all. \n\n\nIt may seem like this is happening more often now than it used to because of how much traffic Reddit gets these days is resulting in many of these \"reposts\" getting lots of attention and bringing them up to /r/all for everyone to see multiple times.

It seem like trolls are taking over reddit. The scheme is like this: trolls get more karma and influence by making several puppet accounts. The puppet accounts up vote and give silver to each other so the troll can earn more influence and able to post links of things they are selling or click baits. Also by gaining more karma (obtained mostly by puppet accounts)  they can look good on paper so they can get into the moderator groups, that way they can stop reporting against them and their puppet accounts, and get the whistleblowers booted out/banned. How? by the means of down voting massively with their dozens sometimes hundred of puppet accounts. The auto bot moderator bans people by warning moderators when mass down voting occurs. Since this is an auto function mods don\u2019t even look a what was posted and ban people. That is how forums get destroyed by trolls. I even reached out the particular thread moderator team and NEVER got a response. The troll deleted the post when I expose it, but kept all the awarded silver and made some excuse about being \u201cinspired\u201d by a mega thread, when in reality copy word by word and made himself a copy mega thread. I got banned for bringing it up to the moderators because \u201ctruth seeking\u201d was not allowed.

I had a severe lack of confidence, at least I seemed to in my own head, because whenever I\u2019d tell someone \u201cgod I was so nervous when I was talking back there\u201d they\u2019d be surprised, telling me they didn\u2019t notice, when on the inside I was like a fish flopping on the deck of a ship. \n\nI can\u2019t pinpoint exactly when I stopped doing that to myself, but one day I looked back on a conversation I had earlier that day with a woman I worked with, a \u2018small-talk\u2019 conversation that to this day I still hate doing, and I thought \u201cshit, I felt like a normal person!\u201d. \n\nIt was a gradual process. It took exposure to situations that made me uncomfortable and moments in which I had to call on experience from previous conversations to get through. This sounds so robotic but it\u2019s the truth! Other people around you seem to breeze through conversations and you can\u2019t help finding yourself desperately envious, but the truth is you just weren\u2019t born with the same communication skills that they were. That DOES NOT mean that you can\u2019t acquire those skills through experience and practice. Put yourself in situations that scare you, a little bit at a time, and eventually your people skills will pick up and you\u2019ll have less and less to torture yourself over.\n\nBest of luck!",

I would judge my actions and when I asked people later about it, I was 99% of the time, completely wrong in what I thought!!\n\nI had a craniotomy last weekend to remove a 3 cm cystic mass in the lower, right, back of my cerebellum.  It's being tested for the same type of cancer that chemo destroyed in my breast and lymph nodes this last year.  Now, I never really do it anymore.  I think this experience changed me for the better.  It made me realize that life is way to short for me to worry about that stuff like I used to.  If freed me to be more myself.\n\nWe are all just people living our lives.  I try not to worry what other people think now.

            "Absolutely not my area of expertise, but my understanding is that you don't want to cut all the way through.  You want to leave a flap of skin to close up the nub.\n\nAlso, the main difficulty in an amputation is getting through the bone.  If you've ever tried to use a cleaver in the kitchen, you know that it takes a fair amount of force to get through even a thin bone.  I imagine trying to use a guillotine on a limb would either result in an incomplete cut, with the blade stuck in the bone, or a massively splintered bone.",
            "You need to cauterize or otherwise close up the arteries you go through.  Cutting them all off at once would probably lead to a bleed-out before you could get to all of them.",
            "I would say because, unlike a decapitation, most people plan on continuing to live after an amputation. So they'd want it to be handled with a certain degree of precision and expertise that you can't get with a guillotine. If you're being executed noone really cares about your well being. If it doesn't work the first time they'll just try it again while you're hollering.",

            "I thought even guillotines sometimes needed to be launched a few times.",
            "The guillotine just cuts a straight line, while a doctor needs to cut the bone a bit shorter than the muscle and skin to be able to stitch up the skin around the amputation.",
            "There is also a difference between an surgical amputation and an orthopedic amputation. The surgical one is relatively simple - you cut off a limb and roll a prepared sleeve of tissue to cover the nub, but still, you need a clean, perpendicular cut and a specific bit of flesh and skin. The orthopedic one is far more complex and requires a lot more time, as it is essentially preparing the limb for a prosthetic. Therefore the doctors have to attach severed muscles to shortened bones, creating artifical ligaments, provide proper circulation and nervous supply... So guillotines wouldn't really be effective in either cases.",
            "Apart from what others answered: It's damn impractical. Most amputations were done  because a severe wound was about to kill the patient. This puts us on a battle field. You simply didn't have the possibility to transport the patient to the guillotine. First amputations were done within minutes (straight cut) and then \"cauterized\" with hot things like boiling oil to stop the bleeding.",

            "I\u2019m weirdly knowledgeable about guillotines so here we go:\n1. People underestimate how good guillotines actually are at chopping off heads. The blades get dull quick and are really hard to sharpen or change, it often takes more then swing to get the head off. \n2. Guillotine blades are just thin enough to go in between the spinal discs to probably take off the head. The blade is nowhere near sharp enough to get through bone, especially the very thick bones of the arms and the legs. So if you tried to use it on say an arm the guillotine would not chop it off in one go. \n3. Amputations are not meant to be a clean chop that leads to a bigger open wound bigger chance of infection and gangerine.",
            "They were - head amputations!\n\nBut serious answer - I know a few people with amputations. When they do it they flap back the skin and muscle then cut the bone. That way they've got parts to fold over like a burrito and sew shut. It takes a while and you need to be careful about what parts you're cutting in which order. Guillotine isn't precise enough.",
            "Short answer:  Guillotines are fast, but they aren't accurate.  For surgery, you want accurate.",
            "Cuts made by guillotines are not clean... it's not like a surgical slice that you can just suture up. They break bones, tear flesh, and leave the skin very ragged. You would be far more likely to cause further damage with a guillotine.",

Traumatic amputations obviously did, and still do, occur in the battlefield but with significantly lower survival rate since the risk of bleeding out is so high.\n\nCaveat that with the \"golden hour\" of current battlefield and access to modern field hospitals.\n\nBut even during the world wars, and probably at least as far back as the Crimean War, casualties have been treated at a field hospital. A field hospital isn't literally on the battlefield, it's fairly far in the rear.\n\nCasualty management is a logistic art of it's own. From immediate movement to a casualty collection point, to a medivac point, through triage, and into the ward or immediate treatment. None of which should wait until the fighting is over, and none of which should occur on the battlefield.",

But since they \"adopt\" ANY kind of snake in distress, they have a substancial collection of snakes so rare and exotic (and dangerous) that there are no antivenoms available because they were never developed.

I never knew about it until I had a patient with one. Damndest thing, cut right through his lower leg, no flap, nothing but a simple dressing. When he moved his knee or leg you could see the muscles, tendons, bones all move.\n\nWeird shit.",

That would cause more damage in an amputation situation than the swiftness of the cut would alleviate. Most people think the executee was knocked unconscious or otherwise physically unable cognate by the blood pressure to the brain prior to dying within a 5 to 20 seconds. There are reports of people trying to communicate with the severed heads and receiving what appeared to be at least recognition or focus, but never a response of any kind. My guess would be that it basically turns you into a vegetable for the few remaining seconds of your life.",

You may wanna hang on to the v-card until you find someone that respects your wishes.\n\n\nYou are both very young, but it sounds like you have a good responsible head on your shoulders. So, go with your head and your gut. You should sleep with someone because you want to not because you've been pressured into it, you do it when you are fully ready. Also just a heads up the first time is usually awkward and terrible, so don't be surprised if you come out the other end thinking what the buzz was all about lol.

            "So many red flags:\n\n>\ud83d\udea9I don\u2019t want to rush into sex but he said everyone is doing it at our age.\n\nThat is a lie he said to get you to do something you don't sound like you are sure you want to do. FYI: average age of virginity loss in the US is 17. Very few are doing it at 14.\n\n>\ud83d\udea91.) He said he was allergic to latex, but we\u2019ve used latex gloves in class with no issues before. Plus they make latex free condoms but he said they always have a small percentage of latex in them.\n\nThose are multiple lies. He is not allergic to latex (he uses latex gloves) and latex-free condoms do not have latex. The entire purpose of latex-free condoms is to not have latex, and because latex allergies can be fatal, it's very important they not have any latex. There are 3 different type of latex-free condoms and one type is \"lambskin\". It's made of lamb intestines and has no more latex than a steak you eat in a store. Lambs are not made of latex and there are no lamb-latex hybrid creatures (fyi: lambskin condoms prevent pregnancy but are not good for disease prevention, which is why they are not more popular). Even if there were no other red flags here, this would be enough because it shows he thinks you're an idiot and will fall for even the most transparently untrue of lies. Don't be with a guy who thinks you're stupid. You're not stupid, you're very responsible and assertive and smart, because you are wanting to have safe sex and have stated that clearly and you yourself have seen how several of the things he has said are untrue. You deserve so much better than this guy.\n\n>\ud83d\udea92.) even when I bring up that bc won\u2019t protect from std\u2019s he\u2019d say \u201cso what you\u2019re saying is you don\u2019t love or trust me\u201d which I feel is super manipulative.\n\nYou're exactly right--it is super manipulative. Another example of how he does not love or respect you and also thinks you're stupid. His treatment of you is making my blood boil here. I also want to point out to you a concept you may not be familiar with. It's called \"[projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_projection)\". It's a psychological phenomenon where a person accuses another person of the thing that they themselves are doing, often as a way of justifying what they are doing, or as a defense mechanism to reject their own thoughts about something. That is what he is doing. He says you don't love him, but in reality it is he who does not love you, because this isn't how people treat those they love. This level of manipulation does not exist in a healthy relationship. Likewise, while he is saying you don't trust him, in reality it is he who is not trustworthy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\ud83d\udea9and I feel like I\u2019d be a prude if I didn\u2019t. When I have said I had second thoughts he called me petty because I was withholding\n\nSo even more manipulation and lies. If it's prudish to not want to have safe sex at age 14, then [90% of girls are prudish](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sexual-activity-rates-miniscule-for-young-adolescents/). Giving someone your V-card shouldn't be a coercive act by someone who is trying to manipulate you into it with lies. If you don't trust a person, don't have sex with them. You can't trust him, he has lied to you multiple times in just a few sentences of description of him. I can't imagine how many other instances there are, if this was just a few sentences. You deserve so much better than this. You will think back on this relationship negatively when you get older because honestly this guy just seems super cringeworthy.",
            "There are two things that people get wrong about relationships. Love alone isn't enough of a reason to get into one or stay in one, and attraction alone isn't a good enough reason to have sex with someone. Your rational brain should still be involved in both decisions, asking questions like \"Does this person respect my boundaries?\"\n\nHe doesn't respect your boundaries or your body, and he's openly trying to use guilt to manipulate you. He has two options: He can find a condom he can wear and have sex with you or he can find someone else who's willing to have sex with him without a condom.\n\nIf he doesn't respect you, he isn't a catch. You will know hundreds of people over the course of your life who don't respect you, and having sex with any of them is a bad idea. Wait for someone who sees you as more than a hole he's entitled to.\n\nAlso, because I think age is a relevant factor in the advice you're receiving here, I'm 35F.",
            "Wait people are having sex at 14? I\u2019m 13 and I haven\u2019t even considered getting into a relationship lol\n\nAlso: your BF seems like a manipulative asshole, be careful and DO NOT compromise on boundaries.",

            "There are latex free condoms.\n\nDon't buy that BS, because anyone with a legitimate allergy will know about them. The same goes for being allergic to \"spermicide\", and you literally can't be allergic to all types of lubricant.

Not unless you are in a long term and stable relationship with someone you trust.\n\nAlso, don't let someone pressure you into anything you're not ready for regardless.\n\nIf he's calling you petty because you won't \"put out\", it's because he's an asshole who is only interested in himself.

He is the petty asshole in this situation and isn't worth your time.\n\nHe's just showing his true colors at this point, and you should realize it. His immature frustrations are not your problem.\n\nYou never owe anyone sex for any reason. It is yours to give or refuse for any reason you want. I don't care if you've been married for 60 years, this is **always** the case and doesn't **ever** stop being true.\n\nIt's **nice** to be open and provide explanation if you're in a relationship, but you don't **owe** that to anyone and whatever \"excuse\" you have is valid and final regardless.\n\nDrop him and move on.

            "Ok so first off your boyfriend is completely full of shit about the condoms. There are more than 75 non-latex condoms currently on the market in the US and Men\u2019s Health has done several articles reviewing them and testing them for people with allergies and intolerances. Here is one of their articles about it.\n\nhttps://www.menshealth.com/sex-women/g34620995/best-non-latex-condoms/\n\nSecond, it doesn\u2019t matter if you are 14 or 40, if you are not 100% ready to have a sexual encounter, you shouldn\u2019t and that is also true if it\u2019s your 1st or 1000th time having sex. Sex is an intimate and intense thing even if it is a one night stand and you should absolutely confident that it is what you want before you do it.\n\nThird - there is no such thing as a 100%, fool proof birth control so stacking up with a condom as well is just good sense, you are both still minors and are in no position to have a child. Condoms are also a good idea for a couple of other things such as preventing HPV from being spread (can have without ever having sex), preventing a yeast infection from being transmitted to your partner, and lowering the chances of a UTI from sex for both of you.\n\nFourth - never sleep with anyone who feels it\u2019s ok to pressure you into it. Him saying that you don\u2019t love or trust him and that everyone your age is doing it is flat out manipulation and utter bullshit. It also starts greying the line of consent.\n\nLook I know what it is like to be your age and having a BF pushing to get into your bed, I was 14 when I lost my vcard and regretted it the moment it was over because I was pressured pretty hard into it. I am not going to preach and say you should wait for marriage or anything like that but do wait to do it when you are 100% sure and that your partner respects you enough that when you are not sure, they are patient and willing to wait until you are instead of pushing you into something you might not be ready for.",

When someone shows them who they are, believe them the first time. There\u2019s a reason you\u2019re having doubts. If he\u2019s bullshitting you and blaming you like that, he\u2019s not worth being the first. Clearly he won\u2019t even care if you\u2019re liking it. Don\u2019t let anyone treat you like that. I wish somebody would have said that to young me.",
            "Girl, no. Take it from a 40-year old woman who was once pressured into sex, because I was scared to be a prude with the boy I liked (who, btw, turned out to be a complete user). You don\u2019t have to do anything you don\u2019t want to. If he doesn\u2019t want to wear a rubber he\ncan go rub one out. If you just want to stay in the hands and mouth stage, that\u2019s fine, too. \n\nA person who truly cares about you will never, EVER pressure you into something you\u2019re even a little unsure about.

My girlfriend and I used condoms and birth control in tandem until I had a vasectomy and was given the all clear by a urologist. You have the right frame of mind. There are also condoms that are non latex. \n\nSecond point: Your body, your rules.  Let me repeat. In no instance does another person have rights over your body.   Do not waiver on this point. Do not concern yourself with what other people think about you for this.  Let the people who can't handle this filter themselves out of your life.  This should really be the first point.\n\nThird: Dude is pressuring you into sex.  He is almost certainly lying to you and I highly recommend you do not spend time on someone you cannot trust.",
            "Stay strong. Only you will know if you are ready. It is not about being a prude at all. You have to consider at your age that any time you have sex, even on birth control, there is a possibility of pregnancy. I know so many people that were conceived when the mother was on birth control. I waited till 20 to lose my virginity because I waited for someone I was comfortable with the idea of having a child with. I wasn't planning to get pregnant but I wanted to be sure that if we accidentally did it would be ok.",

It's good that you're talking to other people about this because someone guilting you or shaming you into sex is very coercive.",

            "First.. and I say this without judgement, you two don't really sound mature enough for sex...\n\nThat said...\n\nIt is never petty to change your mind about sex. You are not obligated to do anything and owe him nothing. If he  can't meat your terms... too damned bad for him. He absolutely does not get to guilt trip you about trust or anything else.

            "There are non-latex condoms.. BUT he's pressuring you into something you don't want to do and lying to you. Straight up call him out on his bullshit and send him packing, tell him he can come back if he wants to get on board with being honest and respecting your concerns without the games.",
            "Absolutely not, sex is supposed to be consensual, meaning both parties are agreeing to what\u2019s happening, NEVER EVER do something you aren\u2019t comfortable doing, and if at any point you get uncomfortable, you stop. Latex free condoms NEVER have latex in them, because that\u2019s illegal and dangerous to latex allergies. And the \u201cdon\u2019t trust me\u201d is manipulative you need to leave him hun, trust me you\u2019ll find the right guy, but he just isn\u2019t it. What he is doing is very toxic and dishonest. I lost my virginity when I was 13, which was 11 years ago, always use a condom, in fact bring your own condoms, and if he doesn\u2019t want to use it, you don\u2019t do it. My parents always told me never trust a girl when she says she\u2019s on birth control. But they also told my sister, never trust a man with a condom, but your own. That being said, don\u2019t lookout for him, lookout for yourself, and you\u2019ll get through this.",
            "If you aren't 100% sure then don't do it, and he's making up excuses, there's arguably no real difference with or without condom, tell him to get smart and put one on",
            "Either wear birth control or just don\u2019t. Last thing we need is some kids who cant even drive trying to raise another kid. Smfh",
            "You are both young but you seem to be the mature one in you\u2019re decisions. He may mature in the coming years but from what you\u2019ve said he\u2019s just trying to convince you to have raw sex with him.  He called you petty for being mature, he\u2019s not wort losing your vCard to. Move on to someone that cares about you.",
            "Don't be afraid to speak up about any hesitation surrounding sex and/or foreplay/kinks, etc...  That is your body and you have the right to change your mind and decide you like or don't like something as much as you want. No matter how old you are, no matter what age everyone else lost their virginity,  no matter how long you have been with someone or maybe you just met them.  People have sex for different reasons.  Go with whatever feels right for you and lose it when you're ready.  You have lots of time to enjoy sex trust me"

I do this every day when I\u2019m alone, if I read or see or just imagine something funny, idiot, that makes me angry or just an ordinary thing and at the same time someone pops into my head, there I go again talking to myself, sometimes laughing, sometimes arguing, I already caught myself crying and fighting with the air and nowdays this simply got out of control. I tend to talk to myself or those people (mostly people I know, but many are just creations of my mind) at any place and anytime, even on the streets, always alone, but many times I look at my reflection and it\u2019s weird. I have no problem with communicating with people and I\u2019m very open so I don\u2019t think this would be a reason for me to do this, it\u2019s just a weird mania.\n\nI also have conversations with myself when I\u2019m on the mirror, but like I said nowdays it got out of control, I found my other self telling me to do stuff that I don\u2019t know if I only imagined that I wanted in those crazy conversations or if I really want to do them, and they scare me, because I know I can\u2019t stop doing this and I don\u2019t know how to control my actions.\n\nI\u2019m looking for a psychiatrist now for other reasons, but I feel like I\u2019ll have to talk about this, because it used to be just a part of me and I was relieved when I found out that there are so many others who do it, but I\u2019m getting afraid of what I\u2019m telling myself because it\u2019s like my imaginary me is in control.",

And when I meditate I'm thinking thoughts almost from a distance, and letting them go - but who is the me that let them go? If the thought is really gone then would I be thinking about the thought that is gone? How is it that tiny sparks in our brains can be translated into a mental landscape?

            "Realistically, your brain is actually several people. Many regions and functions of the brain largely operate independently of each other, with the overall result creating the person you think of as you. In a healthy brain, the functions all bleed into each other and it's incredibly hard to isolate and define them.\n\nIn unhealthy brains, though, it can get a lot more interesting.\n\nTake the corpus callosum. This little fellow is a thick bundle of nerve fibres who facilitates communication between the two largely separate halves of your brain. In cases of severe epilepsy, we sometimes surgically extract part of the corpus callosum because it significantly reduces the impact of epilepsy on the patient. \n\nThis can result in split-brain, or callosal syndrom. People with this condition often find that their body (or at least parts of it) are operating on an entirely different set of motivations. Patients have reported a number of odd occurrences.\n\nWhen one split-brain patient dressed himself, he sometimes pulled his pants up with one hand (that side of his brain wanted to get dressed) and down with the other (this side did not). Another found that one hand would pay for a service and the other hand would attempt to snatch back the money.\n\nOur best understanding of the brain now is that it's more of a committee that we (usually) experience as a single entity. So it's not at all surprising that the conscious parts of your mind, the bits you think of most strongly as you, spend a significant amount of time attempting to communicate to the rest of the committee.\n\nOne needs some form of consensus to get out of committee, after all.",

People find it funny when you talk about it, because nobody thinks about it when they're doing it and people will spur laughter when it's easy to do so. Socrates called it self-dialogue and it was one of his steps in living a good life. It's a way to look at another perspective in your mind and talk about it. Kind of like a simulation preparing for actual dialogue. If you do it consciously it's a good tool for thinking. In fact science (or at least some psychologists) support that it's actually good for your mental health and thinking as well, not just Socrates. It's pretty interesting stuff. I researched it a while back when I realized I did it and thought it was kind of funny and I wanted to see if that's a normal thing. I spend a lot of time thinking and reasoning things out and I really like debating with people so I would self-dialogue a lot and sometimes I would do it out loud while going through a very long train of thought, especially when I was tired. I noticed that I was doing it so I acknowledged it and told my brother about it to see what he thought about it. I said \"Isn't that pretty weird and funny? That I'm talking with myself about stuff basically\" and he said \"It's probably normal, I think I do the same thing.\" I still think it's a really interesting thing, though. And yeah everybody does it, so I'm not special or anything. Boo hoo for me. I've got a link for some of the science and stuff about it. I think I can find a link for the stuff about Socrates as well, cause I looked into this like two years ago so I'm sure some of my information might be a little off.\n\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/better/health/talking-yourself-normal-here-s-how-master-it-ncna918091",

            "I never really gave a fuck, and knew my parents were bigoted anyway, so I never said anything about it. I just lived my life, they figured it out and *eventually* got over it. When they were being assholes, I just left. My living situation was shit to nonexistent for a while, but it worked out. I never moved back in, but I'm lucky enough that they realized they would rather have me in their lives than have me straight.",

            "this isn't an option for everybody. people make a whole thing out of it because some people need to be explicitly told. it's not as easy for everyone as\"let it come up when it comes up\", because if they did that, they might have harsh backlash, which is extremely risky for those who aren't self-sufficient.",
            "This is the experience that I hope my daughter has. She's five.\n\n\"Coming out\" implies you've been \"in the closet\" - hiding who you are, pretending to be someone you're not. I hope my daughter never has to experience that. I am doing my best to not assume anything about her sexuality. If we ever have a need to refer to her future hypothetical spouse we talk about \"your future husband or wife\". I've made it clear that you need a man and a woman to make a baby, but that you can love anyone you want regardless of gender. We take time to remind her about her aunts who are married to each other, and daddy's best friend who lives with another man because they love each other.\n\nWe had a talk the other day, too, about how she doesn't *have* to have a baby. Somehow she got it into her head that she MUST have a baby some day, and I nipped that in the bud. I told her she could have one if she wanted to, but if she didn't want to that'd be fine. I suppose that's not directly related, but I want to reassure her that she can choose a spouse based on love, not based on whether they can make a baby with her (so it can be a woman).",
            "I did 'come out' with the talk and the whole shabang. I felt like I had to because I wasn't sure I would be accepted by my family, so for me it was like a deciding moment whether I'd still be in contact with my family or not.",
            "Congratulations, you're reaping the benefits of thousands of people who worked hard to make diversity of sexuality a more accepting concept in the world.\n\nJust so that I'm not misunderstood, I'm saying that's a good thing. People worked hard to make \"coming out of the closet\" not a thing anymore. People are what people are.",
            "Yeah I literally don't even feel like my sexuality is a part of my identity I'm so casual about it.  I don't like being made the token girl that other girls will make out with at parties and it doesn't really change my life one way or another for me to tell people so I just like... don't feel the need to. I think only a handful of my friends know and my parents probably wouldn't be told unless I started to seriously date someone of the same sex.",
            "Yeah, I just treated being gay like I would have if I was straight, if that makes sense. If anyone asks I'll tell them, but I never felt like it was anyone else's business, so didn't felt the need to announce it. I don't even bother correcting people at work if they ask if I've got a girlfriend/wife, I just say no I don't.",
            "It's funny, I never had to come out to my friends or any new people, but I never came out to my husband until... he was my husband (obviously I'm a woman, who's bi). I think he knew, though, I told him and he went \"Yeah alright. I think most people are at least a little bi. You're just more bi than most\".\n\nStill haven't come out to my mom, but again, I feel like she'd be... not surprised? I think she'd be a bit disappointed, I think she wouldn't believe me because I've been with a man for years and years, so it's weird now. I'm 30, so I've just left it. But in the same way she \"knows\" that I'm an atheist despite us never talking about it ever, I think she wouldn't be surprised to hear me say I like women, too.\n\nBut aside from those two, I felt the same way you do. I never had to come out. I'd just talk about women and men in the same way or whatever, and it was pretty evident I found women just as attractive/would date a woman just as readily as I would a man.",

A few days latter I get a dm from my mom \"daddy may not know but mommy does.\" ... That is the closest I have ever had to a 'comming out'. I never really felt comfortable introducing my parents to my bf/gfs in high school.(nothing against them, I was just a closed off teen) \n\nMy dad passed. But my mom has since met both boyfriends and girlfriends. And it has never been a question of what my sexuality is. I've never had to say \"I'm bi.\" To her.",

And before anyone calls me niceguy, incel or whatever the latest bullying word is, I don't have friends of any gender, so it's not a gender specific problem.",
            "I'm aroace. Never really mention it except when people ask, and then I usually only say I'm not into the gender in question\n\nWhen I say \"I'm not into girls\" or \"I'm not into guys\", people are usually okay with it. I've rarely gotten backlash by people assuming I was gay, and when I did, I had plenty of non-homophobic people on my side. But when I have outright told people I'm not into any gender that way, they start telling me that I need therapy/ there's something wrong with me etc\n\nSo I usually only mention the relevant bit (like, if a guy starts flirting with me, then the relevant bit is the fact that I'm not into guys)",
            "I never came out. Always dated guys, so it wasn't an issue in my family, so when I got a girlfriend I didn't tell them about it. I told some people the same way I'd tell them I had a boyfriend. Eventually my father asked if I was dating my guy roommate because I was wearing a ring and I just told him I had a gf. He got really pissed but couldn't do anything about it because we were at his gf's kid's 18th bday party. I didn't ruin the party or anything, no one noticed, but I never again got invited to their house, and thank god, because I just can't stand those obnoxious people. Eventually I started dating guys again and they think that made me straight lol",
            "I am so happy for you OP! Since my son was about 2 or 3, I knew he wasn\u2019t straight. Don\u2019t know why, but I never once doubted it. My husband and I made sure to reassure him from a very early age (as well as his brothers) that we don\u2019t care who you love, and any sexual orientation is very ok to us (sometimes jokingly added the remark \u2018as long as there isn\u2019t a giant age gap\u2019). For example, we always said things like \u201clater when you have a boyfriend or girlfriend\u201d, and made sure to change some fairytales to same-sex romances. We also both have gay best friends who where a witness at our wedding, and our children know this.\n\nUnfortunately our son still felt he had to come out to us when he was 13. I was so sad for him because he was very frightened and stressed about what we would think. Apparently, sometimes parenting can\u2019t compensate for insecurity.\n\nHe is a very happy and proud bisexual at the moment by the way.",

            "This is a different experience from the other posts but the idea is the same, where there is no coming out: \n\nI know a guy.  His dad and step mom are pastors, and they never acknowledged his homosexuality.  Like Hardcore Latin American Pastors.  His sister, which is also his best friend (besides his boyfriend of some 30 years now) does not acknowledge it.  I was introduced to them as Mr. Doe and his \"Friend.\"  Their family calls Mr. Doe's boyfriend his Room mate or Friend.  \n\nIts very uncomfortable at family gatherings because Mr. Does Friend will have to do a bible study with Mr. Does father for like 2 hours.  Mr. Doe never came out, and probably thought his father would accept reality at some point.  Mr. Doe's father is like 94 years old though, which is funny to me for a lot of reasons.  Perhaps 50+ year old Mr. Doe thought he would outlive his father, but at this point it does not look like it.  \n\nIf only he had been honest from the beginning.  Then again, he is having his cake and eating it by keeping a relationship with his father and not putting a strain on the family.  He and his boyfriend just have to pay in bible studies.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry if this doesn't make sense.  Its my first time explaining this on text.",

            "I grew up around the gay community, my lesbian mother was quite active on the political side of things. I've seen a number of youths \"come out\" and a few that didn't seem to need to. Most of the homosexual people who did \"come out\" expressed a bit of envy towards the ones who didn't have to. \"you're so lucky your parents were just so accepting\" \n\nWhether you had to \"come out\" really depends on the dynamic in your family. Even if your parents are pretty open minded, if they rarely talk about sex and just seem to take you being hetero for granted, it can be pretty scary to have to tell them you're not. Every adult homosexual has either had to deal with disbelief and outright rejection or knows dozens of others who had. \n\nMost people don't seem to have that moment of realization about their sexuality until they are in their early teens and just beginning to explore dating. Even for heteros, that is a time of life when they are feeling very emotionally vulnerable and develop an acute sense of sensitivity to their private lives. Imagine having to tell your parents at 14 that you want them to knock on your door before entering because you've recently started masturbating regularly. Every budding homosexual or bisexual has a pretty good idea that at least some parents aren't accepting, some are outright hostile to the concept. Even if they believe **their** parents aren't like that, there is always some measure of doubt. \n\nAfter more than 40 years, I can see a definite change for the better. Young gays today don't have to \"come out\" as often as they used to and even when they do, they are far less likely to be ostracized by their family for doing so. When I was a kid, being gay was still mostly a matter of being covert about it, except perhaps in a certain part of big cities. Today, even in small towns like the one I live in today, a couple of gay teens can walk down the street holding hands and doing other displays of public affection and most people will go \"oh, what a cute couple\", if they notice it at all. \n\nSo, while you are not alone in not having to \"come out\", you are still lucky. Both for having a family dynamic that allowed for such a good understanding and for all the work previous generations of LGBTQ+ people have done to help society at large be as accepting as your family is.",
            "I (gay man) felt very ashamed of my sexuality growing up, and I took until university to come out.\n\nMy dream world is one where people don\u2019t come out.

And so, I (and the majority of other gay men) felt like I had to lie about my sexuality.\n\nComing out becomes necessary under these conditions, because you\u2019ve had to hide your sexuality for so long.

I see myself as a person, who does what I want, and that's my business, I don't need to label it, I don't need to justify it. I just wanna be myself, and when something comes up that interests me, I become interested in it.",
            "My parents are religious and kinda homophobic, so it's been rough for me to hide my sexuality and my boyfriend. Years ago, I was afraid and unsure of my thoughts. Coming out to my friends helped me coping through that process.\n\nNowadays I don't just tell everybody I'm bi, I'm just another guy. But I still don't want my parents to know, I'm sure it'll destroy them.",
            "I'm not gay, but my friend just mentioned to us that he's gay. He was like \"Sorry, I gotta go on date with my boyfriend\" and we didn't really care. We were eating lunch and stuff. We just \" Cya\" and he was off.",
            "I think making a big deal about it is just unnecessary. Either you come home one day with a same sex partner and your parents accept it or they reject it and there's nothing you can do to change that. And your friends don't need to know your sexuality unless you're interested in them. I think lots of people that have a big \"coming outs\" think they need validation for their sexuality, or they want attention.",
            "I never came out as bissexual, although I had to educate my mother about it. \n\nGrowing up she would always say how there are girls who like girls and boys who like boys and that was okay. Since my first crushes where on boys I just assumed I was one of the \u201cgirls who like boys\u201d. I was never taught about girls who like both, so I didn\u2019t knew that was an option for me until I was 15 and got quite confused after having feelings for a friend who was a girl. \n\nInternet taught me what bisexuality is and I had a moment of \u201comg, that explains a lot\u201d, but I never felt like it was needed to talk about it with my mom. She always made me feel comfortable about who I was by saying how my life and my body are mine, and as long as I was happy she would be happy too.\n\nOne day I caught her talking with my pan sister about sexuality and I talked about how it would have been nice to know bisexuality was a thing since the begin, and mom told me how she didn\u2019t knew it was a thing either, she always thought bisexual people were just trying out to see which gender they were truly attracted and she thought that was just a phase. I joked saying \u201chave you ever seen me confused about what I want in my entire life?\u201d and that was enough for her to understand it. She said something about how we learn new things everyday and apologized for my confusing years due to her lack of knowledge and that was it.",
            "No I had to sit down with my parents and tell them i was straight.",
            "Is your name by any chance Alex and you\u2019re croatian?",
            "We just finished all of the seasons of Community and I love the way the Dean deals with his sexuality \u2014 have you ever watched that show? He\u2019s \u201coffended\u201d when he is accused of being gay because \u201cthat doesn\u2019t even scratch the surface of what I am.\u201d I love that it\u2019s posed like that... he doesn\u2019t need to make a conclusive announcement, he just... is! All of it!",
            "That's the dream. Sounds like you never had to be \"in the closet\", ie misrepresenting your sexuality in the first place. Coming out is a scary and necessary step when there's a lot of stigma and brouhaha about one's sexuality. I'm hoping for a future where nobody needs to come out of the closet anymore.",
            "My childhood best friend (we are no longer close) was boy crazy and always had the most chaotic, dramatic, on-and-off relationships with her boyfriends all through high school and into university.\n\nI just saw via her Instagram that she\u2019s recently bought a house with, and is now engaged to, her female fianc\u00e9e. Even our mutual friends who she is still close with never mentioned a whole coming out. One day she brought her girlfriend to a party, and that was that!",
            "I'm a bi guy but mostly into women, so I've never dated a guy long enough for it to come up to my family. One time my brother and I were drinking and he goes, \"what's the gayest thing you've ever done?\" He definitely wasn't expecting the answer I gave hah. \n\nBut all turned out fine, I don't think my parents know. If they do they haven't brought it up.",
            "In high school it seemed everyone was bi and I didn't want to make it seem I was jumping on the bandwagon so I never told anyone.  Not that it mattered. In conversation it would come up here and there but not a lot. When I made my MySpace profile I put it on there and my mom asked about it, I said it was correct and she was like OK. Most of my family and in-laws know and don't care, an ok amount of friends. I don't really see a point in making a big deal about it, I'm married and happy so that's all that matters",
            "I've come to discover that it's a million times easier to be out than to come out.",
            "I've wondered about this for do long: how do pansexuals differ from bisexuals?",
            "I haven\u2019t and don\u2019t plan to \u201ccome out\u201d to my parents or friends. I don\u2019t actively hid my sexuality (pansexual) but i don\u2019t advertise it either. I\u2019m still the same person I\u2019ve always been and no one comes out as straight.",
            "Yeah... I'm a bisexual guy. Technically I'm bisexual, hetero-romantic. That means I only fall in love with girls, but I enjoy having sex with both. I'm not going to \"come out\" to my mom to tell her I enjoy sucking dick and getting fucked in the ass...",
            "I casually told my sister one day then she told my mother and we never had that kinda talk",
            "Yeah. I don't feel comfortable yet so until I date a person of my gender I don't need to do anything",
            "Yes. Been bi for my whole life (obviously). I think maybe five people really actually know... Because I don't give a shit lol I don't want that kind of attention. I'm just me. No need for all the noise.\n\nAt one point I kind of thought I wanted it to be a big deal but then realized that was just me being unhappy and wanting something \"big and exciting\" to happen.  \n\nI've never got all the hysteria around it. Like you said... If it was relevant it was mentioned, and it has almost never been relevant to a conversation. Which is fine.",
            "My sister is very dramatic one day she just came home with a girl (her gf but we didn't know she was a lesbian) and sat on the settee and started making out with her the rest of the family kinda just looked at each other and in the end my grandad said I don't care if you like dick or fanny but we don't need to see that got up and walked out, and that is the story of how my sister came out.",
            "Lol my parents beated me when they found out i was gay and then decided to deny my homosexuality for the rest of time",
            "I never had to come out as straight why should you have to come out.\n\nFrankly if my kids ever came out to me I\u2019m not sure how I would feel, part of me would be glad that they can tell me and part sad that they felt like they need to tell me at all. Who they are is who they are and it doesn\u2019t change how much I love them.",
            "More people should do this because honestly, no one gives a shit about who you're fucking.",
            "I've never explicitly explained my sexuality (bi) to my parents but they've never asked or cared. I remember one time when I was like 23 a friend of my mom's got real awkward cuz I was with a guy and I overheard her ask my mom if I was gay and my mom's response was \"I have no fucking clue, I don't care, I love him\" I'm lucky I think",
            "That\u2019s the way my family would most likely react, my dad is from the Netherlands where being gay is very accepted and not really made a big deal out of and mom just overall accepting. I\u2019m in a relationship with a guy now but could see myself in a relationship with a female and they wouldn\u2019t question it either way. I never really felt the pressure to define my sexuality, so whatever happens happens.",
            "My uncle is almost 60 and has been with his partner for around 30 years now. He never came out to his family, one day he just brought his partner home and no one questioned it. \nConsidering people in his parent\u2019s generation are generally less than accepting of homosexuals, he is extremely fortunate to have a family that just didn\u2019t care. They were happy that he is happy.",
            "Not coming out is the goal. Unfortunately in my society (America) when you start  doing gay thing shit people freak the the fuck out. You can lose a lot or be harmed. \n\nSomeday people won\u2019t have to come out, and I\u2019m glad you were able to just be you. Hopefully it will be like that for everyone someday.",
            "Gotta disagree with your definition of bi, my friend. You forgot to include enbies! We bi people don't usually like to go by the bi=2 definition because it leaves out some very important gender groups.",
            "Me, I just one day introduced my gf to my friends and they just acted like it was another boyfriend & we didnt rlly talk ab it ig they jus guessed i liked girls haha",
            "I am straight. I had to come out to my parents that I wasn't gay! They assumed me being a loser with no gf was because I was gay. I am so happy to have parents that didn't think I was a loser rather gay"
