            "Because it's not the same group of people.  \n\nBaby boomers, like every other generation, aren't one monolithic group.   In fact millions of us voted for Obama, then Hillary, or Bernie, and just now worked our asses off for Biden and to get Ossoff and Warnock elected.   We volunteered, donated, phone banked, etc etc.   We spend our time working to debunk falsehoods, and absolutely telling people not to believe what they read on the internet.\n\nAt the same time, some boomers are complete fucking assholes.   We can't  BELIEVE how stupid and awful they are.   We hated them back in the '60s, too--they were the ones who told us we were dirty hippies and voted for Nixon.    There are a TON of them (and a ton of assholes in the generation above us, the ones who are in their 80s).   But they aren't the majority, and never have been.   We are as disgusted with them as everyone else.    But you know, there's a whole bunch of Gen Xers and millennials in that group.   The whole QAnon stuff started with much younger people, and plenty of lying, right-wing extremists (Jacob Wohl, Ben Shapiro, Madison Cawthorne) are millennials.   Lauren Boebert is Gen X, so is Marjorie Greene (the two lying extremists who just got elected to Congress).    \n\nAnd you know how millennials hate it when the whole generation is generalized as \"lazy and entitled\"?   It's the same thing.  Most millennials are super dedicated, wonderful, hard working men and women really doing their best.  (And we know how hard it is for you.)   You're our KIDS.   We LOVE you.    But the same time, some millennials are actively out there harming the rest of us. \n\nEvery generation has its cohort of assholes.   Please don't lump everyone in with them!",

            "Why are you limiting this to boomers? Do you think you\u2019re immune to it? Do you think zoomers who grew up on the Internet are immune? They\u2019re not. \n\nI regularly see half-truths and outright lies upvoted to the top of reddit. Things that could easily be disproven with a 30s google search. \n\nEveryone is liable to fall for disinformation. EVERYONE. Including you, including me, including the boomers, and the PhD nuclear physicists. \n\nOn another note, keep in mind that the Internet has a way of making things look bigger than they are. 22% of Americans are on Twitter, and 80% of tweets come from just 10% of the users. If you visit twitter you might find things that are popular that are totally absent from real life. Similarly, just because it seems like boomers are idiots, doesn\u2019t mean they all are. Loud minority. Or, shit, how everyone on reddit was certain that Bernie Sanders had a chance - both times - even though he didn\u2019t. The internet is messing with your mind, my friend. Take a walk in the park and talk to strangers. People are the same all over.",
            "As an old git on the net, this thread is a nugget of purest bollocks.  \n\nFirstly it's not \"the majority of boomers\".  There's about 40% of the population that is particularly susceptible to propaganda (whether that propaganda is religious, political, or whatever).  That applies to any age range.\n\nSecondly as a species, we are encountering for the first time  the simultaneous use of both echo chambers and weaponised propaganda on an unprecedented scale.  Up until very recently, it was only possible to do this on a relatively small scale, like cults.  OK the religions did this large scale; but it took very much longer; and took generations to achieve what is possible in days or weeks with the internet.  As a species, we have to learn to deal with this shit.  But it's going to be an uphill struggle because there are many bastards using the dark side for furthering their agendas.\n\nThirdly, if you've grown up with the internet then you do get a little extra immunity and a sense of evaluating a source of information.  Before the internet, education for most people was just stuffing facts in, plus a few exercises to use those facts and let it sink in.  Evaluating the value of information sources was rarely tackled before university; thus leaving the vast majority of people just blindly accepting whatever a suitably authoritarian source told them.  This, of course, suited governments and religious leaders just fine.  But people over a certain age - over and above the 40% of people who are more gullible anyway - just have no defences against propaganda.  They've never learned how; and the powers that be certainly had no interest in teaching them.  People who've grown up with the internet know how trolling works and have almost certainly had a go at it themselves, so have a little bit of immunity there.\n\nIn short, it's a problem.  A self-correcting one from the terms of the question because boomers are all old now  and it won't be all that long before everybody on earth has grown up with internet; so the people who have no defences whatsoever will be gone.  BUT, the people who blame boomers for everything are (pause for surprised picachu face) going to be shocked, SHOCKED I say, that the problems are still around unless something is done.  Because you still have that large chunk of extra-gullible population and it's in the interests of many to keep it that way.\n\nI'm not a boomer; but am at the old git end of Generation X; and what I fully expect to happen is that - as time passes and there aren't enough boomers to blame - GenX will take this same flak.  And there will be some merit...not everybody in that age range will have as much internet time as I've clocked up and there is a significant chunk (albeit, of course, a smaller percentage) that have exactly the same problems the boomers had; that of having never been trained to evaluate the quality of information that they're taking as true.  A lot of us have seen the signs and taught ourselves how to evaluate information; but there's still going to be a bunch of people who haven't.\n\n======================================\n\nA lot of how this works is due to a glitch in how the brain works.  The brain remembers and accepts that something is true; but doesn't remember where the information came from.  So if you can persuade people that a false Fact A is true (something that I privately call a 'wedge fact'); then that is in there and accepted as true.  This can be used by bad actors and built on....if Fact A is true, then facts B, C D & E must also be true.  This is how malicious fucknuggets can build entire false realities and that's what we're seeing now.\n\nTL;DR:  It ain't just boomers.  They certainly are not helping; but they're not the problem.",

            "Because their \"distrust\" of internet media was never about the intrinsic unreliability of anonymously sourced sites/resources with no proper op-sec to validate its claims.\n\nIt was about frustration with younger people learning things that went against the things they believed, and looking for a credible justification for why those beliefs couldn't be trusted.",

            "It's not even just that age group, it's multiple generations of people not being skeptical enough about misinformation that is being peddled on the internet and elsewhere. It's also not new. It's just more prolific. Remember the famous statement about cigarettes being a nicotine delivery device? Well, we all have a very specious information delivery device on us now in the internet.\n\nIn the 70s I was told numerous urban legends by adult family members who swore they were true because they heard it from someone at work and it happened to the friend of a friend of someone they vaguely knew of. The worst one I remember was the very racist \"choking Doberman\" story. \n\nIn the 80s, there was no internet/computer in most homes and there was still a lot of nonsense (Satanic Panic comes to mind.) \n\nIn the 90s a few of my friends were pushing anti-vax and weed cures everything bullshit. \n\nIt's just that the delivery is now constant, and combined with the 24 hour news cycle, it makes it hard to parse out the truth, and even harder for some than others because of confirmation bias. You have to fight that in yourself and others. \n\nMy family is currently on about the virus being bio warfare from China. I politely say I'll wait for evidence of that and am not sold on the idea at this time. That's my answer to every bit of the stuff they want to assert without evidence, and I can see it frustrates them that I am challenging what they've already decided is true, but their \"truth\" seems to lose a little steam when challenged.",

            "So you're getting a lot of answers, but they all seem to be the \"lemme dunk on boomers\" variety as opposed to real answers. \n\nEssentially it boils down to a few things. First of all is culture. All across America, we've managed to make our political stance a cultural thing. The right wing has done an impressive job of positioning themselves as a religious party, and this has made a lot of people feel that they should align with the right in more religious groups. Religion is dropping off with younger Americans, but it remains a strong force in the lives of the elderly. Boomers are no exception. If you go through the Midwest or the deep south, it isn't exactly a decision to be conservative; it's a matter of \"do you want to fit in or not?\" Refusal to support the Republican party is essentially self-ostracization. \n\nNext up is the matter of experience. As you've mentioned, Boomers are generally less tech savvy than younger groups, as they didn't grow up with the internet. They're less likely to understand internet subcultures, and as a result they're significantly less adept at recognizing false stories on the internet. Ironically, when it comes to print media, boomers are significantly better at recognizing false stories than younger generations. \n\nNext up is appealing to inherent biases. If I were to write that more liberal Americans score better on IQ tests than more conservative Americans, most of Reddit would probably nod in agreement and say, \"that checks out\" before moving on. Except that I just made that up. No idea if it's true. But it makes the reader, who is more liberal, feel smarter. We all like to think we're above average, so it plays to our inherent biases and makes us feel clever. \n\nLikewise, a *lot* of the insane conservative stuff you see plays to their inherent biases. Republicans are godly, therefore Democrats *worship the devil in secret cults!* Republicans are pro-life and wholesome, so anyone who isn't *drinks baby blood*! (These are real Q things, by the way).\n\nBut we don't start there. We actually start with disingenuous stuff like Prager U and Ben Schapiro, then we work our way up from there. These guys make regular appeals to the ethos-- the sense of \"I'm very smart and you should listen to me.\" If you look at their media, it's overwhelmingly attempts to dunk on liberals. Shapiro almost explicitly \"debates\" college students because he knows they'll be less prepared. He engages in a technique called the gish gallop, where he tosses out a dozen lies in a minute, and his opponent is forced to either spend a minimum of 12 minutes picking apart those lies without responding to a question, or else they have to just ignore it and treat those lies as facts. Shapiro isn't trying to sway the person he's speaking to; his goal is to engage with that person's audience, or the audience that sees him speaking, and to say \"see-- look how clever I am as I OWN this lib with FACTS and LOGIC!\" And it works-- the people who are this insanity and have conservative biases are generally swayed to believe that Shapiro won his \"debates,\" because Shapiro's claims were all short and pointed and aggressive while his opponent's were long winded and too boring to read, and besides, they didn't get as many likes!\n\nThe next bit had to do with the dumbest bits of our monkey brain. Fun fact: if you see something repeated in multiple places, you're more likely to believe it. Doesn't matter *where* you see it-- your brain isn't as good about remembering that. Seeing something in the New York Times and seeing something on Facebook are roughly the same if you don't make an effort to split the two up. Another fun fact: in a study where one group of humans was shown the text \"windmills were invented in Persia\" and another group was shown an image of a windmill with the text \"windmills were invented in Persia\" superimposed over it, the second group was significantly more likely to believe it. (although windmills *were* invented in Persia, so I guess take it with a grain of salt?) \n\nThe point of this is, we inherently trust memes way more than we want to. It's not something that happens at a conscious level, it just happens. And you may recall-- Russia spent a lot of time, money, and energy generating a network of fake accounts across Facebook and Twitter to share memes and posts that promoted falsehoods about the election, all of which played to conservative biases. They started out plausible, like the guy who claimed to find crates of votes filled out for Hillary Clinton prior to the 2016 election, and then, once they had the hook, they got steadily more insane. \n\nThe last bit is, predictably, the dumbass ex president of the United States. Trump peddled these falsehoods regularly on Twitter, and he was the dammed *president of the United States*! Historically, you had to be pretty darned smart to earn that title. So there's a strong appeal to authority-- if the president promotes it, why shouldn't I believe it? Suddenly the onus is on fact checkers to prove a negative, which is all but impossible. And Trump peddled a *lot* of stupid shit. His most successful one was \"fake news.\" He liked that one a ton, and it was hugely harmful. Calling legitimate news sources fake means that there's no longer an agreed upon reality. Now we can look at *any* source-- including Russian-produced ones-- and claim that it's just as legitimate as NBC, NYY, WaPo, WSJ, etc. They assume that the \"mainstream media\" (ugh) is all in cahoots with the \"evil\" Democrats (and it plays into decades of pre-existing conservative rhetoric about the liberal mainstream media that's out to get the poor, oppressed conservatives).",

The DoD has no record of anyone by that name serving during that period...\u201d and so forth.  People would pay for a newspaper to learn what was going on, or watch TV news for the highlights, based on the efforts of journalists to present objective reality to the best of their ability. \n\nBut when the Web exploded, it conditioned people to expect news for free, leading to massive job cuts at news organizations, which precluded the labor required to do the hard investigative reporting needed to get to the truth. As news revenues plummeted, it also inspired desperate efforts by news organizations to get ratings and clicks, leading to clickbait headlines, and the passing off of innuendo, rumor, and worst of all, opinion (labeled \u201cperspective\u201d by the cable news channels) as if it was objective truth. Journalists in the 1970s would have been summarily fired for expressing any hint of opinion.  Today, Wolf Blitzer stands in front of a camera telling viewers that Capitol rioters are \u201cstupid,\u201d to please his boss, Jeff Zucker, who is an entertainment executive, not a newsman.  It\u2019s a shameful cycle that feeds on itself, with entertainment executives pressing ever harder on journalists to get ratings, and to be first instead of accurate.  \n\nJournalists have shamefully responded by gleefully abandoning a once-vital and noble profession that had solid ethical standards to become shills and showmen indulging their biases and fueling the emotional and political divide by reporting not the truth, but that half of the truth their viewers want to hear.

Their default position on anything labeled as news is \"truth\" and it's hard for them to turn that off and be more critical of the sources they're looking at.\n\nThe nature of social media also obscures the actual source of the news and if you should trust it. If someone shares a news story and is alarmed about it, the boomer will be thinking about if they trust the person who shared the story, not the source itself. Most don't even click on the link.

Some pedophiles believe that they can control their unwanted urges through prayer and abstinence, so they enter the priesthood. But some of them fail.\n\n2. Some pedophiles believe they can get access to people's children by becoming a trusted authority figure who works with children, like a priest or teacher.",

Usually, the pedophile does things to the victim. Homosexuality is still about sexual gratification but from the same sex. \n\n2. The pedophile does not care about morals or church doctrine. Church doctrine is more anti pedophile than it is anti gay. It's violating many tenants of catholicism to abuse boys. \n\n3. Historically boys are more available than girls.

I\u2019m not judging this position, but it must be noted that human nature is such that people have sexual urges.

I met up with him a few times after that, by which time he'd been appointed to a panel at the local diocese to investigate priestly abuse. He told me that, in his opinion, the root of the problem was that the church tended to scout for potential 'recruits' at too early an age and that by the time they entered the seminary they were still too young to have explored or even experienced their sexuality. Consequently, a significant proportion of seminarians were stuck in their teenage years, from a psychological point of view, and had yet to form an interest in the opposite sex.",

That\u2019s a hard concept to wrap one\u2019s head around, my wife (a psychologist) had to explain it to me more than once. But basically even if a pedophile is homosexual it won\u2019t stop them from going after a child of the opposite gender. \n\nAs for why \u201cpriests rape boys\u201d the question again isn\u2019t really about sexual orientation, it\u2019s about accessibility for the predator and the vulnerability of the victim.

            "There's heaps of answers in this thread that I think are really useful and explain a lot - I agree that they're not too concerned with morality, and they deliberately seek out positions of power over children, but there's one theory I haven't seen yet. Some Christian denominations (including Catholicism)  teach that any sex that *isn't* between a husband and wife is sinful.   \n\n\nSex with your boyfriend/girlfriend? Sin. Sex between a married couple who are the same gender? Sin. Sex with a young child? Sin. Sex with someone you just met on Tinder? Sin. Forcing sex on someone who doesn't consent? Sin. Consensual sex between two adults (that falls out of the very narrow criteria of \"only between a husband and wife\") is lumped in with horrific acts of rape and paedophilia. Sex between a married couple who are both men, is treated as morally equivalent to raping a young child (according to some churches). Hell, even masturbating/fantasising about sex can be seen as sinful. If you're already fantasising about molesting a child, by their logic, you've already sinned, you might as well follow through.  \n\n\nIn case I haven't been clear, I personally think that all sex between consenting adults is morally neutral, and any sex acts involving children are abhorrent. I also understand that 99% of Catholics don't think this way. This is just what I've come up with when trying to wrap my head around this topic.",
            "I think its the outcome of repressing sexual urges for too long. Priests are expected to refrain from sex and be celibate.

Whenever someone brings up bible verses such as Leviticus 18 22 that is used against homosexuality, they are bound to be proven false because apparently the original latin (or hebrew I think) version of the same verse was highly mistranslated and speaks more about incest.

            "Well first off in all fairness to the Catholic Church it's not just Catholic priests, they just happen to be from the biggest organization. Almost every other Christian denomination has seen similar levels of abuse from pastors towards alter boys or other children in their congregations. That being said the work to cover up sexual abuse within the Church is absolutely horrible and should have overarching consequences.\n\nAs for the reason, its usually a mix of repressed sexuality and power within the Church hierarchy. A lot of priests are gay men who since they can't be married in the church decide to join the priesthood. This doesn't always mean they will become a pedophile, most never do anything sexual during their career or some like my old priest have a boyfriend or flings on the side and hope they don't get caught. That being said an unfortunately significant portion of priests did target boys for this reason. \n\nThe second part is power. A lot of the abusers within the Catholic Church are priests or bishops who tend to have the idea that they deserve respect and tend to have a lot of power over their congregation. A lot of the time abusers tend to congregate towards these positions of power, which is what happened here. In their eyes who would people believe, their local religious leader or a little kid. They did it because they thought no one would ever call them out on it and even if they did they had the means to access church funds to defend themselves. Unfortunately it worked for a while and abusers were able to get away with molesting kids for years before people finally started bringing it up.",

            "Predators go to where they have easy access to victims, can gain trust easily, and cover up their crimes. That made the Catholic and really any church a good cover for pedophiles.  Perfect cover because \"he's a man of the cloth, he would never do that\".  The Catholic church has long been more interested in protecting itself than it's followers hence they moved problematic priests around.  Lack of easy communication made this an effective policy for centuries/millenia.  It's only in the last 30-40 years has mass media grown and mass communication grown to where it's much easier to link up individual cases as a large all encompassing systemic issue.\n\nThe whole past of the church going back to shortly after Jesus is actually a very sordid past.  The church was power & money in the western world.  Prominent families would vie to have their family member declared pope in order to control the vast power base that was the church. Popes were killed, cardinals and high officials bribed or blackmailed with money, women, men, children (per their particular fetish) to support a certain family's papal candidate.  Many popes had children via their mistresses/wives.  The history is fascinating and really makes a modern soap opera / telenovela look tame in comparison.  People murdered.  Corruption rampant. Blatant ignoring of church principles. Do as we say, not as we do.\n\nNow, the problem is most noted as being in the Catholic church. But it is endemic in all religions.  Southern Baptist, Lutheran, Protestant, Mormon, Jehovah's Witnesses, Islam.  All have this issue. It just hasn't come to light like it did with the Catholic church. Plus the Catholic church has a strong centralized structure and keeps vast records.  The other religions do not have such a strong central structure.  So it was much easier to track & trace with the Catholic church.  The other religions have been quietly disposing of records and trying to CYA rather than actually address the issue. Mormons have been very active is excommunicating anyone speaking out about problem elders/bishops.  Jehovah's Witnesses rely on a cloak of secrecy throughout their whole organization with shame as outcasting of anyone speaking out or making accusations.",

            "theres always gonna be shitty people in positions of power, priesthood is no different. im non religious but worked for catholic schools for a few years, ive had priests as my 'bosses' come and go, and the bad ones did a variety of shitty things such as embezzling money from the school budget to perform cheap ass renovations for their church (and keeping the unspent money), becoming homewreckers with women having affairs, generally trying to live a luxurious life off of the golden throne while being a shitty manager at the same time, and of course inappropriately interacting with kids.\n\nthe affair thing was interesting to me, because i feel like some priests can't handle the no wife/gf thing and often find themselves creeping on kids or hooking up with women who have their own reasons to remain discreet. why they seem to gravititate to boys i don't have much answer to, but 'alter boys', who often help every week with mass, is usually a position taken up by young boys that spend A LOT of time with the priest, so it probably comes down to the same reasons why a boy scout leader ends up being a diddler\n\nthe catholic church often turns the other way, and will often move 'problem' priests from church to church to take the heat off of them with a new community, because its more expensive to fire them and quite difficult to find replacements in 2021. only when they diddle a kid and cause an uproar is when theyre actually fired. heres an easy way to tell if a church has a shitty priest: does he show up to the community functions ran by the church? (Soup kitchens, fundraisers, etc) If he's often not found at these events, hes probably not entirely in it for glory of jesus hernandez christ, as that guys golden rules were to take care of the poor and to spread the word through your community. definitely not a sure tell he's molesting folks, but it's a tell for me that he is probably no stranger to skirting the rules.\n\nbasically priests can be evil humans just like anyone else, but they can often be glossed over enough due to their job, convincing them that they really can do no wrong, and every bad thing they do is a lil secret between him, 'god', and hopefully the kid hes diddling. this is indeed not a stupid question by any means, it's often conflicting seeing priests dedicating their lifestyle to their religion but there's a lot more benefits and cheats to being a priest that can often outweigh the 'sacrifices' they make in order to maintain their priesthood",

I think girls were first allowed to be altar servers in the 80\u2019s or 90\u2019s, but I would guess there are still far more boys in this role, and I think some diocese (regional sections of the Catholic Church) still only allow altar boys.

            "Other people have made really good points, but I remember watching a documentary on this issue with something along these lines being said: little boys are likely to be more ashamed of being molested than girls due to the immasculating nature of the situation and are therefore less likely to talk about any abuse they may have encountered, hence why many priests may choose to target them.

            "I read an article about pedophiles and rapists that was really interesting.\n\nI always thought, why do priests become child molesters? Is it because they are not allowed to marry?\n\nThen I read this article that put things into perspective:  Depraved individuals are drawn to professions where they inherently have power over people they perceive as weaker than them.  Religious posts are one of the number one professions or callings that draw sick individuals because of the allure of power over many people.  Obviously, not ALL priests.  But hey, look at Mormon church leaders as well.\n\nIt's not a matter of \"homosexuality\".  It's a matter of deviant sexual behavior and power.\n\nA priest or religious leader who sexually abuses a child or anyone (for that matter) is not a homosexual per se.  They are a predator.  Sick in the head.\n\nThink about rape.  It's not a matter of, \"This woman was so beautiful, I couldn't help myself.\"\n\nOr, \"She was drunk and dressed like a whore.\"\n\nRape/molestation is about power over someone else.  Rape/molestation is about defiling another human being that the rapist gets off on having power over and degrading the individual they are abusing.  Whether it is a woman in a bar or a child left in trust of another adult.",

It mean that being homosexuals is pedo.\nOnly Kevin Spacey would say that....",
            "As is the case with the religious leaders of all faiths and secular leaders that are- for some unknown reason- allowed alone time with children: these predators are not worried about the faith or their obligations towards whatever institution they are affiliated with. For these priests, the Church is a ladder for them to climb and use to rape.\n\nThe Catholic Church is infamous for it because there is a hierarchy not found in many other organizations that is itself infested with predators and only in recent years have they been getting the justice they deserve. The Church has a long way to go, but thankfully they finally figured out that letting people be alone with children is a no-go.\n\nEither way, the point is that despite the Church's failings to deal with these monsters, the predators are not acting as men of faith but are rather using their collars as a disguise to prey on the vulnerable.",
            "It doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re gay. It means they\u2019re predatory pedophiles.",
            "Yes. In Catholicism it's a sin for a man to have sex with a man. Pedophilia is also a sin (regardless of the genders of those involved). Most of the priests who rape children aren't all that concerned with abstaining from sin.",
            "It seems there are a lot of factors in this. Depending on the perpetrator, some or all of these may apply.\n\n1. Predators tend to seek out positions of power, authority, and areas of minimal scrutiny in positions with people who are particularly vulnerable. Religious folk trust Priests with their children. They trust Priests with their confessions, their sins, etc. etc. It's a trusted position, with easy access to children, and the parents of children who are just desperately looking for some answers in this crazy messed up world of fear, pain, death and uncertainty. Priests are offering answers to vulnerable people, to their children, and have the authority of God on their side. If you were a pedophile, priesthood would seem like a pretty viable job option for getting access to the people you want.\n\n2. Studies show that repression tends to lead to more errant behavior and bad behavior as an outlet for repression. The Catholic church condemns a lot of things that others would call sexual liberation. If you masturbate it's a sin. If you watch porn it's a sin. If you have sex outside marriage its a sin. Etc. etc. As far as we know, virtually all organism's seek out pleasure/good feelings, and the act of procreation. Sooner or later the very natural human animal side of you needs to be fed, but your religion has told you to repress your very nature. So you desperately continue to repress your urges until you just can't take it anymore, and instead of relieving yourself in a healthier way, you end up expressing your deep repression by doing something unhealthy and fucked up. This is not just a religious problem. Repression in all kinds of ways tends to garner a sort of \"rebellious\" response. People tend to rebel against their repression, and often in unhealthy ways especially in severe cases. For example, look at pornhub's data on people who live on religious communities.\n\n3. Many people who have urges they find sinful tend to seek out ways to curb those urges. A rapist, a pedophile, a homosexual may believe they are sinful or wrong for having such urges. So they seek out religion as a hope to actually save themselves from what they believe or know is wrong. But then they simply fail, because they were in a position of power that could be abused.",
            "Church is an organisation ran by closeted homosexuals who's main goal is to deny other homosexuals ability to lead a normal, happy life since the priests weren't able to have one. A classic example of 'if I can't have it no one can'",
            "My theory is that many sociopaths discover throughout their life that they can gain the trust and affection of people through religion. I'd imagine most sociopaths grow up as compulsive liars and manipulators, and while everyone would just scoff at them when they claimed to be a secret agent or something, when they would say things like they saw god or attested to these grand spiritual experiences, that may have actually caught people's interest, even adults, and they would be met with positive attention and admiration. With this in mind, you can kinda see how a sociopath would be drawn to religion, and how they would find the power religious leaders hold over their congregants appealing. \n\nI am doubtful that pedofiles go into priesthood simply for the child molesting opportunities. That's just too much of a long con for it to be so prevalent. People want their sexual urges satisfied immediately, not 4 years from now. I think instead that the profession of priesthood and really all other types of religious leaders attracts sociopaths, and those are the types of people who rape kids.",
            "One reason priests target boys is because of easier access to boys than with girls. And, yes I would think that many priests who rape boys are also homosexuals as well as pedophiles. But because they can repent and say a bit of prayers, the church absolves them of their \"sins\". That is just wrong.

            "Where my uncle grew up, he had two choices for his career path: to be a coal miner or to be a priest. He became a priest less because of his specific beliefs and more because it seemed the more educated option. In his area, Catholicism was less of a religious belief and more of an active culture and community.\n\nHe realized he was gay early in life. Did this conflict with his beliefs? No. He and honestly his entire family repeatedly demonstrated how their nitpicked their religion to suit their life, not the other way around. Two members specifically opposed the religious doctrine but never fully left Catholicism because many of the beliefs and traditions were so ingrained that they couldn't escape. One was also gay could never escape the dreaded Catholic guilt regarding that and everything else.\n\nI think for many of these priests, it is the same thing. They became priests less because of it being a true vocation and more being the best option for them, either to escape other choices or because, as others have pointed out, it provided a legitimate excuse to not marry and to be alone without having children. From there, they pick and choose which beliefs suit them best and toss out the rest.\n\nTo add to that, they're in a community which will actively hide their sins. Priests fuck a willing nun? Hidden. Priests fuck an unwilling nun? Hidden. Other men? Children? It is an inclusive community, and I can see it actively calling to pedophiles the same way other professions would. These people grow up Catholic. They know know community. They know what they can get away with as a priest.",

No mystery there.\n\nThe only thing different in this case is the institutional cover up that allowed priests to repeatedly offend with relative impunity.",
            "I suspect that priests might have a natural tendency to be gay -- when forbidden it seems like people realizing their sexual attraction can't be expressed in society might tend towards the priesthood more than people who would be losing their ability to express sexuality.  And perhaps more asexual people would tend to the church as well.  That's part one.\n\nAnd part two is that they are convinced that they are speaking with god and that god communicates to them to do their will.

            "You've got to look at a few factors really:  \n\n\n1. the catholic church is an OLD institution datin back to Rome. In roman society having sex with little boys wasn't seen as such a bad thing and traditions die showly.\n2. Positions of power are sought after by psychopaths and many psychopaths won't think twice about manipulating someone weaker than them. Especially a child. It makes sense too since the requirements of being a priest is basically having the gall to lie to someone about your confidence in things you know you absolutely have no proof of and aren't sure of yourself. \n3. Again due to the nature of religion the whole morality side of is isn't so much principals on which the church or it's members stand so much as easily accessible reasons they can reference when they wish to feel morally superior to others. There's very little the church actually stands for that doesn't have a benefit for itself or it's individuals in some way. That's why you see Christains all over America waving guns around talking about shooting up intruders and then saying they turn the other cheek on Sunday. Or see the morality they claim to stand for (to make themselves feel better than others) compares to who they vote for out of pretty much selfishness.\n4. It's kind of like a virus too. Because 'making sense' isn't something that's valued in Christianity. The highest virtue is faith and demanding evidence for things you claim to be true are looked at as negatives. Otherwise they'd jeopardize the entire basis of their religion.\n5. Written right into the religion is if they feel bad about things and say sawwyyeeeee to a sky ghost it means things are all good and they can walk around with a clear conscious.   \n\n\nAdd all those things up  and you've got psychopaths applying for the position of traditional rapists who feel morally superior and entitles to being right while leading a group of people who feel facts are second class truths compared to what they want to believe. So them raping little johnny is just a misunderstanding and they don't have to be gay if they don't feel like accepting they are. And anything they do they can just feel really bad about and God will give them a break. An oversimplification? A little. But those are massive parts of why this keeps happening.",

He essentially spent his whole life figuring out how to build a brand.\n\n3. I think you\u2019ll see something similar if Democrats have a candidate or President who is exciting. Clinton and Biden weren\u2019t exactly exciting choices for Democrats. A lot of their votes were basically \u201cat least they aren\u2019t Trump votes.\u201d Sanders has also developed quite the base for himself, and so have a few others, such as AOC, but neither of them have had the same success in politics that Trump has had. Becoming President, or even winning a major party nomination, gives you quite the national stage. \n\n4.

Then when that same church says the Savior sent Trump to us; to help him and to obey him, and to do otherwise supports the devil, you wind up with the insanity that we have. \n\nI don't believe my family will ever shake it personally.

To me trump symbolizes, in all his actions and thoughts, a sense of \u201cgrievance\u201d.  There is a lot of grievance within the evangelical community, and the white supremacist community, about the trajectory of this country.  If you had asked me, as a queer college student, if gay marriage would happen in my lifetime, if a black president would happen in my lifetime, I would have said: \u201cIf we work tirelessly, maybe when I am a grandma.\u201d  And then it happened within ten years.

It's no surprise the mainstream sources are very antagonistic to Conservatives, warranted or not, and there never really was a ton of people on then Right who would hit back.\n\nSo then we get Trump... he basically just broke the decorum that Conservatives thought they loved... Jeb planned on a nice clean primary so that he could \"decent\" his way to the presidency.  The media smeared him and then he just shit on the people who pretended to be unbiased sources.  Then he got in the gen election and got to turn Hillary, who I'm convinced every human hates, and basically spent the entire time doing the American fantasy of dragging her through the mud.  \n\nAnyways he destroyed two political dynasties in one election, and was the first politician to really challenge the dinosaur media.",

A hunter-gatherer pack is as it sounds, they're someone that survives by hunting and gathering edible goods. Hunter-gatherer packs is speculated as the earliest form of human socialization, far before communities like tribes, cities, or countries were made. Humans naturally cling to as smallest group of people as possible, forming strong bonds with friends, because of this. We naturally segregate ourselves in everyway possible, cutting out those we view as expendable or not essential for our personal needs, all in order to both form the ultimate pack but also so we can confidently be certain we are as huge of a priority to other members within said pack. While we as a species socially evolved, our wiring still clings to the instinct to make pack sized social circles of people with the upmost high level of love and respect, individuals we value the most and everyone else being an acquaintance, stranger, or even enemy. This is why we create cliques in school, this is why we have video game console wars, this is why we have racial tension, this is why we get serious with our sport teams, and this is why you and your friend have a bond strong enough to label it as something special.\n\n\nYou, as a hunter-gatherer pack member, have a special privilege that also comes with a high amount of responsibility. Anyone else will be over-crossing boundaries, you however can speak freely with trusting of intentions rather than taken as a full on attack for as long you word it clearly with concern rather than lashing out. As a hunter-gatherer member, you have the responsibility to look out to your pack, keep them in check, and sometimes letting them know when they're doing something wrong, something stupid, for a long time ago pack members relied on this feedback for it was a life or death alteration. \n\n\nBe a good pack member, go tell your friend, and without hesitation. Just make it clear the motive is of concern and your friend will cope however they need to, if they choose to react to it at all. They might not react positively to your feedback, they might change their entire life around it, but in the end what matters is you fulfilled your role as a friend rather than be concerned about being the asshole.",

I\u2019m sure he would like to stop marrying people whom he will ultimately divorce, but just telling him to stop forcing it isn\u2019t very helpful.\n\nI think you have to look at why the two relationships ended so quickly. How long were the entire relationships, like 2, maybe 3 years? Marriages can be hard and there are often significant stumbling blocks in the first few years. So, either he or his brides were really incompatible or abusive, or didn\u2019t care enough to try to make it work.\n\nDo you have any idea, specifically, why the marriages didn\u2019t work out? Was it mutual, or did one of them force the divorce? Were there similar reasons or patterns in the two relationships that could help him understand and why they didn\u2019t work out?\n \nMy advice would be to just help him recognize the patterns that he is apparently missing. I wouldn\u2019t even suggest telling him not to look for a new GF. He probably won\u2019t listen, but might assume you will have a bias against anyone he finds. If that happens, he is less likely to listen when and if you see incompatibilities that he is ignoring. Maybe ask him to talk to you before he proposes for a third time. Make sure he knows you won\u2019t automatically discourage him, but that he just needs to take a moment to talk it over with you and make sure he can justify the decision with words spoken out loud.\n\nAnd ultimately, if he didn\u2019t have kids with either of these women, there are no lifelong consequences of these failed marriages.",

            "Endoscopy nurse here, your entire large bowel is basically a soft tube, so the turds, which start out as a liquid, gradually harden into that tube shape as the bowel absorbs the water. The bowel is wider than your asshole, so it is squeezed a bit thinner on the way out but still retains basically the same shape. If you want to know how much thicker the turd is before it comes out, just hold it in a bit longer! As your Bowel absorbs more of the bog fluids, the turd will harden more until your butthole can no longer compress it on the way out. The turd will maintain its original shape as your gaping rectum is painfully stretched open to accommodate the now dry, rock hard dump. :)\n\nEdit: Hey, just want to clarify a few things after reading all your questions, comments and a few private messages:\n\n1. Don't seek medical advice from strangers on the internet!\n\n2. Don't try to hold it in to see how big it gets! Super cool that you've got a high pain tolerance,  but you can actually do serious damage to your bowel and ass.\n\n3. Bowels respond to change. Changes to diet, exercise and stress can affect the smell, firmness and how often you go. If you still have the same habits you've always had but your guts aren't behaving like they used to, see a doctor. Like I said. Bowels respond to change.

Femcels get used for sex all the time, and nothing more.\n\nFemcel's concede that they could get someone with low enough standards (incels) to fuck them, but ***NOT*** persue a relationship with them.

They're about deep, unconfronted insecurities. They won't ever be happy with someone else because they aren't happy with themselves.\n\nJust kinda rambling here, but I think that is actually a really common feeling. I definitely went through a phase in my early 20s where I wanted to find a partner to \"complete me,\" where when we were together I would suddenly be better. Then I dated women and was like \"what, why aren't I perfect now? It must be her fault!\" (silently to myself, I obviously never said this out loud or even consciously knew that that was my thought process). I eventually realized I was being a dipshit and grew out of that perspective. I bet a lot of people reading this have similar stories.

It's that they don't speak French. \n\nIncels aren't incels because of bad luck. They aren't perfectly healthy people ready to have sex once a willing candidate comes along. They're incels because they're decided to set an impossible standard for anyone to achieve and insisted that anyone who doesn't meet that standard is unworthy of their time. \n\nThey refuse to speak French and just make up their own language call it French, go to France, and insist that anyone who doesn't speak \"Proper French\" it is a whore or a fuck boy or a Chad, then get mad when noone will speak to them in their made-up language. Then they find someone unachievable, someone who won't talk to or even look at them, and they can project whatever id\u00e9al they want onto that person.

            "I've actually spent some time looking at radicalization chambers (not like I'm an ex nazi or whatever but I have an odd compulsion to poke my nose in places where I don't understand what's going on and try to at least understand the why of it), and it makes a lot of sense to me that they don't link up.\n\nIn a nutshell, radicalization chambers are like a bunch of people crowded around some kind of hole or pit. They throw all of their problems down the pit, and they encourage each other to do the same. That last part is important because validation is insanely powerful. I ran a race recently and the 20 foot stretch at the end where they have 5 or so people high fiving you and putting a medal on your neck and telling you good job... god it's incredibly rewarding. Please stop and imagine it. It's better than you're imagining though, like sex is better than masturbation. They give everyone a medal but it doesn't matter. Feels great. \n\nSo let's make up a case study. \"Alex\" just went through a rough divorce. Got cheated on but couldn't prove it in court. Lost the kids, lost the house, spiralled into a depression that's threatening his job. He opens up to some bozo who in turn tells him \"oh hey check out this forum\" and points Alex at an incel or mgtow forum. He gets there and shares his story, and over the next day or two Alex is battered with validation. It's not his fault, they say. Obviously hers. Losing the kids? her fault. Losing the house? Her fault. Potentially losing the job? Her fault. All of the sudden *nothing is his fault* and I imagine having something to blame all of your problems on is a shortcut to not feeling bad about them. I'm sure you can see how this applies to other radicalization chambers. You're not losing your job because of automation or a shitty boss or your own inadequacy, it's immigrants (or the push for women in corporate positions of power, or affirmative action, or jews blah blah blah, or whatever), and there's a powerful reward for blaming the selected group of that radicalization chamber. Validation. Bonus points for blaming them in a creative or plausible way, but that's not strictly necessary.\n\nSo maybe a few months later maybe Alex is blaming not only the divorce and estrangement of his kids on women (all women, not just his ex wife), but also job loss, lack of promotions, his crappy diet (shouldn't he have a stepford wife cranking out 3 homecooked meals per day?), his unkept house, lack of exercise... for reasons I can't make up but I bet you a dollar an incel forum can... and then Alex stumbles into Betsy, a femcel. He starts chatting with her and eventually, gasp, it seems an awful lot like dating. Well now there's a conflict. A big one. If women are the root of all evil, he can't pair with her because she's supposed to ruin his life. If women are not the root of all evil, then Alex needs to figure out new explanations for the flood of problems that are going to hit him once he's not able to throw them down that hole any more.\n\nSo if they link up, both of them lose a tremendous source of validation as well as a shortcut to avoiding all of their problems. The safe, comfortable, warm, fuzzy, easy solution is for them both to tell each other to fuck off and go report back to the hugbox for confirmation that that was the right decision.",

I\u2019d like to help them - but you sometimes catch a lot of shit from the more entrenched ones.\n\nIncels aren\u2019t all bad people. They are by and large, unhappy people.

But usually because of a toxic mix of high standards, entitlement, deep-seated resentment for the opposite sex, and a misguided belief that they are perfect in every way except for their looks and that this and this alone causes their singleness.  And they're usually completely unwilling to entertain any personal failings on their part as being responsible for their single status, choosing instead to blame everyone but themselves.",
            "Because then they would have to admit that they\u2019re not incapable of finding sexual partners, and that their only issue is feeling entitled to sex with who they feel they are worthy of.",
            "Because [as I pointed out in a similar thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/dji3r1/comment/f46305u), what makes the incel movement is not necessarily \"people that do not have sex\" as you might be excused to think, but instead their essential element is their internalization of toxic masculinity (as in placing high external values on whether or not you had sex yet as how it relates to your value as a man) and they choose to go about it, in this case mostly by blaming society at large, but not from a sense of class conscuous, but as a big injustice perpetrated specifically against men. \n\n\nFrom this point on, and the wider popularity of the movement, offshoots develop themselves like gaycels or femcels that more or less misread the overall issues of the movement and seek to copy it. It's following a wider trend of different groups appearing online that seek the innocence inherent with a victim status, eventhough otherwise they would not be part of a marginalized community.\n\n\nI have no good idea behind this one and it's mostly a hunch, but I feel that might be due to class conscious and from that resulting class warfrare going on at other places, and a need to escape the groups in a position to change the world to instead flee into a victim role.\n\n\n\nAddendum: Now I'm sure someone will specifically want to point out to me, that other marginalized groups like trans people do the same, thereby creating an equalizing with another group, but I would have to deny this. Groups like trans people do receive unwanted public backlash and do historically fall victim to more crimes than most other LGBT groups. As opposed to incels that seem mostly hurt in their pride.\n\nFeel free to ask me for clarifications of these points, but don't hurl the point layed out in the addendum at me.\n\n\n**TL;DR - sleeping with one another just to have had sex once is not actually their primal interest**",

I moved my arm away to which she responded \u201cdon\u2019t you like to be touched?\u201d to which I responded \u201cnot by you\u201d. So she went to kick me in the balls but I moved out of the way and said \u201cno chance\u201d. \n\nAs we all went to leave work later that day, there was a slight hold up at the door so we were all just jammed up and stood in a line, she was in front of me. She moved her ass against my crotch and touched it with her hands to which I pushed her away from me and warned her not to do it again. She said \u201cI\u2019m only joking\u201d before trying to do it again IN FUCKING PLAIN SIGHT OF THE OTHERS. I told her to fuck off and leave me alone and then she laughed and accused me of being gay. All the girls laughed, while all the guys looked disgusted. The manager wasn\u2019t present during this.\n\nAnyway, we all left and me and a friend were walking and he turned to me and said \u201cdude, isn\u2019t that basically sexual assault?\u201d I responded \u201cis it?\u201d He said \u201cman, she literally molested you and tried again\u201d \n\nHonestly, I don\u2019t know what to think. I am contemplating telling the manager but I feel she\u2019ll laugh it off and class it as a joke because I\u2019m a man. And no offence to us guys, but harrassment and sexual assualt isn\u2019t taken as seriously if a man is getting harrassed. Just think of it, if I had done that, I\u2019d be fired on the spot and have the cops on my case. \n\nEDIT: I just wanna do all I can without making this a police matter.

            "Thank you all for your comments. It\u2019s amazing to see that assault on men is taken seriously on here. \n\nI don\u2019t usually talk about my private life on Reddit unless I have nowhere to turn and this is definitely one of these situations. I didn\u2019t wanna tell friends or people in my hometown as I feel this is a matter I want to keep quiet about, plus I would probably be laughed at. It sounds stupid but some people genuinely laugh when a man is left uncomfortable by a woman. Goes to show that people don\u2019t treat it as big as when a woman is harrassed by a man. It is a stereotype that men are supposed to be strong and powerful, this is not the case when something like this occurs. It can happen to anyone, don\u2019t be afraid to talk about it. \n\nI will be speaking to the manager as soon as possible. Fingers crossed that this is taken strongly. I won\u2019t be pressing charges as I just want to work and earn money for a better life without feeling uncomfortable and awkward. \n\nAgain, thank you, Reddit! ",
            "It\u2019s shitty that sexual harassment of men isn\u2019t taken as seriously. Think of it this way - if a guy groped a woman\u2019s crotch and kept repeatedly touching her after she said no, that would be sexual harassment. Just because you\u2019re a guy with this happening to them does not mean it is not a valid complaint. I would file a complaint. ",
            "It certainly fits the description of sexual assault. Not only did she indeed molest you in a way that you had clearly indicated you were uncomfortable with (in some jurisdictions, you don't even have to have clearly indicated it), but she's also been looking through your social media profiles in a way that's borderline stalking.\n\nYou should definitely talk to your manager about this, although how that will go down will depend on the culture and the laws in the place you live. If the manager is worth her salt, she'll take your accusations seriously; if nothing else, this girl's actions must surely be considered inappropriate during working hours.\n\nHowever, while you should definitely take action (this behaviour has to stop), you need to be prepared for a backlash. If she's truly obsessed, then things might get nasty, and you may eventually be forced to go to the police over this. Hopefully, it won't come to that.",

            "Many of the dumbass comments in this thread piss me off.  \n\nSo as a young lawyer the office I worked in had file cabinets lining the walls.  And I often had to bend over to look through them to find the file I needed.  \n\nOne day I\u2019m bent over and I feel somebody touch my butt.  I assumed it was just an accident.  I mean I\u2019m in the middle of a narrow walkway. File cabinet open.  Bent over.  No biggie.

Police don't need to be involved in sexual harassment in the workplace since it's up to you whether you want to press charges or not. You can sue for sexual harassment or even sue your workplace if they're aware it's going on and don't do anything to stop it but sexual harassment in of itself is not a crime.

I've been there, and it's absolutely terrifying being treated like that.

I'm not saying that all women do this. I'm a woman, I'm not hating on my own gender. What I am saying is that people who don't understand or care about such serious boundaries and will violate them relentlessly in this manner can be unpredictable and malicious in ways I've also personally experienced where they get fed up with your rejection and turn on you to make it seem like you've been victimizing them all along. And *that* double standard will *definitely* harm you really soon because, especially in today's climate with a pussy grabber in the white house and the media shitstorm which could take that business down if the owner doesn't immediately fire you and she turns it up another level crazier and makes a bigger story of it beyond an HR complaint. If you don't get ahead of this, you'll be fired real soon when she's tired of being rejected, at which point you'll wish you said something - and good luck using that employer as a reference for your next job when the reason for termination is sexual harassment. \n\nThere's no way this will end well on own.

The beating continued later, culminating with Louima being forcibly sodomized in a bathroom at the 70th Precinct station house in Brooklyn. Volpe kicked Louima in the testicles, and while Louima's hands were cuffed behind his back, he first grabbed onto and squeezed his testicles and then forced a broken broomstick up his rectum. According to trial testimony, Volpe walked through the precinct holding the bloody, excrement-stained instrument in his hand, bragging to a police sergeant that he \"took a man down tonight.\"[6]\n\nImportant to note that Volpe bragged to the whole station house that he had anally raped Louima with a broken broomstick, and NOT A SINGLE COP (or other employee) IN THE STATION HOUSE SAID ANYTHING TO ANYONE ABOUT IT.\n\nThere are no good cops because the system itself is built to ensure there are none. \n\nThere were good *people* in that station house who said nothing, because being a cop made them not say anything.\n\nNot to mention that when you enable people to kill people as part of their job, you select people who want to kill people, or at least people who think killing people is OK.\n\nhttps://www.insider.com/bulletproof-dave-grossman-police-trainer-teaching-officers-how-to-kill-2020-6\n\nHonolulu wanted to protect women from getting killed by domestic violence, so they proposed passing legislation that would not allow people arrested for domestic violence to get gun permits.

            "Religion shares a lot of ground with morality, ethics and how to live a noble life. These things can change over the eons, there are however, still many moralistic opinions that are around these days that also existed when religions were widely followed.\n\nIn regards to masturbation, there can be a plethora of reasons. I'm fairly certain most of the disapproval of it is that sex is supposed to be a sacred, intimate and loving action between a man and a women that is, for the most part, supposed to result in pregnancy. Any deviation from this is to take away and probably corrupt the natural order, evolution and purpose of sex.\n\nIn other words, if you think masturbation is okay, others might think that orgies are ok, or extreme kinks are also okay, and to that point, you may in fact think that that is okay, more power to them, but it on the other hand, it might not be for you, and likewise, your masturbation isn't for the same people who think it isn't okay, as any degree of deviation is a matter of spectrum once you've strayed away from the direct purpose of sex, that which I pointed above.",
            "Religious Studies PhD here, specializing in the early christian / late roman period, but also interested in comparative history/religion.\n\nIn a nutshell, it's because many religions are interested in transcending materiality for something beyond, the spiritual world.  Sex and Money are frequently seen as the two tent poles of materiality, despite the fact that both are necessary, the first for the reproduction of our species, the second for the means to procure your individual physical survival.\n\nMasturbation, alongside non-reproductive oriented sex, is seen as (alongside wealth) the MOST material aspect of you as an individual person, and so the thing that should be controlled the most in an attempted focus from the material \"bad\" world to the non-material \"better\" world.\n\nNot all religions believe this of course, Tantric Buddhism is a notable exception, as was the description of Sumerian religion in Gilgamesh.  There they take a different tack, in at least Tantric Buddhism, that sex is the means of release from materiality (i.e. when you orgasm, you lose a sense of self).\n\nThis is however, the perspective of anti-sex religious theology from their own philosophical perspective, as understood by the highest religious authorities.  \n\nHow it manifests on the ground?  Well for that, patriarchy as a philosophy built off of sexual control does the rest.",

Did a real number on my mind, even after I got married. \n\nBut anyway, the reasoning they would give at those camps is that when you masturbate, you often fantasize about sex or watch porn. And that's giving into lust and on a rudimentary level committing adultery, because you aren't married, yet are consuming sexual material with someone that isn't your spouse. \n\nThere's also the bit about giving into self gratification, when it's something that is only meant to be shared with a spouse and no one else, not even yourself. \n\nIt's completely bull, honestly. I have children of my own and I refuse to raise them with that mindset or even allow it to be taught to them. I was so messed up from being taught that. It almost ruined my marriage, because wouldn't you know it, being taught that sex and lust lessens your value as a person your entire life... somehow that mindset doesn't just disappear the moment you say \"I do.\"",
            "The Abrahamic religions are all based on fertility cults, with similar traditions / festivals as ancient religions. Christianity / Catholicism are especially hot on fertility ceremonies such as marriage. The goal of this is to ensure the religion is kept powerful by having it run in a family line, with people who are part of that religion more likely to have children and more likely to have any children they do have follow the same ritual and ceremony.\n\nMasturbation damages fertility cults as it allows people to experience sexual pleasure outside of their religion. Sexual freedom in general is damaging to religion's hold on people, hence why the strongly religious are opposed to any form of civil union outside of their strictly defined orthodox union. In general, with the Abrahamic religions, the more heavily religion plays a role in your life the less likely you are to experience sexual freedom, and, as you might expect, the greater your sexual freedom the less likely you are to be strictly religious.\n\nIn general, Abrahamic religions expect their followers to put God before any hedonistic desire on earth - it is important that you be a good follower of God before you are a good mother, or leader. For the religious, piety = righteousness, so this makes a lot of sense - you wouldn't want an immoral character to be a leader or a teacher or a mother, after all.\n\nMost modern Christians find their beliefs to be in harmony with certain sexual freedoms like masturbation, but it's an individual choice where you draw the line. If you masturbate and you are Christian you must live with the fact that other Christians will consider themselves \"more Christian\" than you if they don't masturbate, simply because they believe they put God before their earthly desires. Remember that the bible also teachers that women should be subservient to men in the matrimonial relationship, and forbids many excesses we take for granted. \n\nIf you want to follow the texts exactly as a Christian you have to decide where you fall between old-testament and new-testament. There are those who believe any sin is allowed in mortal life, so long as one faithfully and honestly disavows themselves of sin before death by putting their faith in Jesus Christ - even murderers, rapists and child abusers go to heaven this way. Alternatively, if you follow the ten commandments and parts of the old testament it becomes very much a \"pick-your-own-adventure\" of spirituality. Leviticus is a particularly interesting read, banning, among other things, eating fat, touching an unclean animal, eating seafood (without fins or scales), wearing mixed fabrics, getting tattoos, cutting your hair at the sides, turning to mediums or spiritualists, working on the sabbath or selling land.",

            "Grew up catholic. Per my training, the crux of the issue is that lust is a sin. Generally speaking, the logic isn\u2019t hard to follow. It goes like this: Lust causes all kinds of problems (pedophilia, cheating, unwanted pregnancy, lack of focus on studies/god/whatever, and so on.) If lust is a sin, then feeling lustful (horny) is also a sin. Sex is ok (begrudgingly) because it causes good things (kids, marital bonding), but the lustful *aspect* of sex (kinks, desire, play, toys, flirting, etc) is wrong. Masturbation is lust-only sexual activity. It is all the sinful horniness with none of the justifiable side effects. This is the same logic that causes some religious people to reject birth control, sex toys even within marriage, gay sex, and so on. It really is that simple: you\u2019re not *supposed to enjoy it*.\n\nHope that helps. It took many years to unlearn all of that. when interacting with young people who still believe it, I\u2019d encourage you to be gentle and consider that they have been fed that ideology with a life-long IV drip so they may just be unaware that alternative *good* viewpoints even exist.

Having children, going to war, sacrificing themselves for the greater good.\n\nAfter World War II there was an excess production of all basic products, so industrialized nations' economies would collapse on themselves if people stopped consumption. You can watch the documentary [The Century of Self](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ3RzGoQC4s) to see that the solution was to create new needs that people didn't have, through shady marketing tactics, that people internalized as values.\n\nThe people around you have internalized these concepts: Why would you walk when you could buy a bicycle? Why would you use a bicycle if you can buy a decent car? Why would you \"settle\" for a decent car if you could afford a luxury one? etc, etc. It is a never ending pressure to feed the process of consumption. For corporations, the worst enemy is not other companies, is complacency. The minute you are satisfied with your life, you are no longer of use for economic growth.\n\nI assume you live in USA or another First World country, because this is at the crux of economic excellence. Check the video [How to Make a Country Rich](https://youtu.be/Y9zThcMJzQU), where it is explained in detail how this mindset is absolutely necessary for a wealthy society.\n\nYour story is well defined in the [Mexican Fisherman Parable](https://youtu.be/lVSpWnJ42_Y) (there are many versions you can look online), and that is why I think you live in USA.

            "I completely agree. If you're happy with the job you have, with the amount of money you make, if you're *content*, what's wrong with just living in it? Not everybody is going to be a CEO or freaking President, you know? The best thing to do is accept that fact and recognize when you're getting what you need from your job. \n\nThe peter principle is when people get promoted to the point they are incompetent, right? If you're good at your job, you'll just keep moving up and up until you're no longer good at it. And not knowing what you're doing on a daily basis/being bad at it will make you miserable, no? So why push for that? \n\nHaving more money is always *nice*, but if you're comfortable and you can afford *some* wants/luxuries *after* your needs/bills, then what do you really need all that money for, anyway? Again, to me it's about getting what you want from your job. I recently had an offer to make a little bit of extra cash but I turned it down because of the stress that opportunity provided. I'm just not interested. I'm fine with my current cash flow. If a position I'd like better comes along with more money and benefits, then game on, but I'm not selling out my happiness for the sake of cash. That doesn't make any sense. \n\nThe same people who laud success and promotions and making money (and criticize you for not pushing your limits) also seem to be the ones who say \"money can't buy happiness.\" Making more money relieves a lot of stress if you're living paycheck-to-paycheck, but there's a limit to how much happier you'll become, and it hits somewhere in middle class (again, affording some luxuries after needs). There's really no need to push beyond that. \n\nIt's honestly a sick mentality that everyone dreams of being uber-rich. It makes us selfish and greedy. Don't ask for more from society than what you need, and a few more things you would simply like.

It is important to note that the problem with capitalism isn't just some culture we happened to get stuck in.\n\nCapitalist work culture is generated by the rules of the game. It is greatly in the interest of the powerful to force every member of the working class to be as productive as possible. They also have the means to make this happen as they control the means of production and the media. Therefore the culture we got was the one the ruling class wanted us to have. It was also helped along by cold war anti-communist propaganda - having an enemy really cements an ideology.\n\nThe acceptance of capitalist culture occurred in a context where working people (actually, a subset of the American working class, mostly some of the white men) actually received a lot more of the spoils of empire. A few people questioned, but most found this futile since just giving in to the system used to grant a pretty good life. Most people don't want to think too deeply and can't waste their time questioning things that don't appear to be broken.\n\nBut capitalism was broken the whole time - it is a self-undermining system.

Although work is an important aspect of life, taking the time to enjoy life and get the most out of it is the most important thing, not work. We only live once right? And life is short. No one else's opinion matters on this, just do what makes you happy!!",

            "This should be the norm. \n\nBut, we have a culture of bigger, more, better, etc.  Social media to reinforce \"success\" just amplifies things as well.\n\nWe NEED to work less to grow.  Hobbies, time with friends and family, time for ourselves and not just an hour at night when we should be sleeping.\n\nOnce there is enough to pay bills, eat, have even a little spending money, why can't that be enough? It is.",

            "I recently reduced my work load as well.  Went from 55hrs a week to about 38 now.  I am not in any great monetary position and don't have tons of options ahead.  Best decision ever. Don't let your family be you, you be you",
            "You are ambitious for wanting to live life. You will look back with many fond memories. The person that worked 80 hours a week will look back and see work with a few trips peppered in between. \n\nMoney doesn\u2019t mean much if you can\u2019t also enjoy life.",
            "The purpose of life isn't to work more and progress further up the company ladder. \n\nFor those whom think it is. Whats the end goal? Bragging rights? To earn even more with no time to enjoy your money anyways? Buy that 6th car, upgrade to a bigger yacht? Your own jet instead of 1st class? \n\nThe answer is there is a never ending supply of things to upgrade and buy. There is however a limited time on this earth for you to enjoy it.",
            "Because our society has convinced people their value is almost entirely based on how much money they make.\n\nIt\u2019s a dumb way of thinking, good on you for prioritizing what you want in life!",
            "My friend thinks the same thing. He only measures success through money: I told him I wanted to work a dead end factory job and live in a small apartment, and he just couldn't wrap his mind around me not having any ambition of moving forward.",
            "We can never get back time. Time is the thing of highest worth, that we often push aside for other aspirations. Sometimes that's money, promotions, etc. Once you realize that you'll never have enough money (more money, more spending), you learn to live as is and search for ways to gain time. I had a salary job working 60-90hr weeks. I have a wife and 2 yr old kid that I felt I was neglecting by doing this. I went to another job with 40 hr weeks ezpz. I even managed to get hired in at a lower level engineer, but still got a raise from my previous position... So the actual workload for me is about 16-24 hrs of actual work over the period of 3 weeks. My friend who referred me to the job mentioned them hiring me in low with the idea to eventually promote me to a team lead and asked what I thought. I said I'm not interested. He, as a lead just said \"very smart move. Keep that position as long as they'll allow it, because leads have 70+ hr weeks.\" \n\nOne thing to note is that switching jobs is one of the most effective ways of getting raises. Working too hard is a good way to get taken advantage of for an extended period.",
            "Im in a similar situation, but I object to being not ambitious. I am very ambitious, just not for money. I have no desire to 'win' the rat race",
            "If I could drop 20% of my salary to work 4 days a week I\u2019d happily do it. But I also worked a ton of saturdays to get my last promotion.",
            "People get offended if you point out (even indirectly) how ludicrous something they value is.\n\nPeople have been indoctrinated from early education and culture that a person should always strive for more, should always want to progress, should always want to succeed.\n\nIronically, you are striving for more - more freedom. You do want to progress - you want to progress your contentedness in life. You do want to succeed - you want to succeed on your own terms.\n\nThe problem (according to society's judgement) is only that you don't want what they want - if you don't want what they want, you're implicitly stating what they want isn't worthy of wanting. It's frivolous, it's tedious, it's mundane and meaningless - **to you**. \n\nThose last two words are what they don't seem to get - that each and every individual has their own internal value system, and just because you like to look at butterflies instead of Bollinger bands doesn't mean you're wrong.",
            "because lots of people view poverty as a moral failure, not an economic failure. Subsequently, when you're not getting ahead economically, people sometimes think the problem is that you're fundamentally not good enough or that you must not be trying hard enough... it never occurs to many that you might just have different priorities, or that I'd you experienced a setback, that it might be temporary.\n\nThough some of my setbacks have been of my own making, and others a bit more in the medical surprise area, and some both past and future are just about caring for family, the one thing I am sure of is that whether your stagnation is voluntary or not, it is always OK to take some time to take care of yourself, or to take care of your family.\n\nYour priorities aren't gonna match my priorities or anyone else's, never feel like you need to justify them to the rest of the world.",
            "Forget what they say, live foe yourself. A man can be happy with what he needs not what he wants.",
            "Because you *deserve* all the stuff and things and happiness and if you don\u2019t have it then it\u2019s because someone else is keeping you down.\n\nI have known lots of happy people who are mechanic, mailman, or house painter.  Some are married, some smoke pot and play video games.  They have older phones, older cars, maybe a computer or an iPad but never both.  They\u2019re happy and have no interest in management positions or more work because they\u2019re happy.\n\nSociety teaches us we need so many things to be happy.  It used to be that it also taught us we had to go to college and get a good job, now it teaches us that it\u2019s because someone else cheated or tricked or gamed us. \n\nDo you and be happy. You can be satisfied and happy with your life at any age or income bracket.",
            "Nothing wrong with that.  You be you.  Enjoy your life.",
            "I'd like to also do that, but it's not in the budget. The pandemic has taught many of us that just having the basics of life is all we really need.",
            "Because society teaches us if we don\u2019t contribute more than half of our life to work then we\u2019re worthless and lazy and want a hand out, that way the government can profit off of our demise every chance they get",
            "In my previous job I reduced to 60% because I was just tired and wanted more time for myself. I was working like that  for 2 years and it was the best time of my work life. I was much more relaxed and happy (I have social anxiety so less social interactions was beneficial). I had to cut some expenses but I learned to appreciate simpler life like going for a walk on a sunny day and watching birds in the park. \nOne of the biggest lie in the world is that you have to constantly grow. \nYou don't have to! And you don't have to make infinite money and advance your career. You don't have to have a passion or hobby and that's ok as long as you are happy and have enough money for safe living.",
            "You are swimming upstream in a capitalist economy.",
            "I just reduce my hours at my second full time job to 20 a week and took a week of reduced hours at my second. I was tired. And I want two days off a week.  I don\u2019t see the shame in doing what is right for you.",
            "Yeah. Consumerism culture. Must get more to be happy",
            "This is an easy one.\n\nThe people that are doing the frowning have bought into the lie that you need to work hard for the majority of your life to be happy and successful.\n\nMost of them hate it but they can't see a way out. So they ridicule people that are happy without having to work as hard as they do.\n\nBecause let's face it. The ultimate goal isn't being wealthy, it's being happy. Wealth has been touted as the way to achieve happiness. People believe this, so when someone is happy without being overly successful or rich, it goes against everything they've been taught and they can't stand it.\n\nHow can someone else be happy and content without sacrificing most of their lives to work?  They just don't understand and this breeds resentment.\n\nIt's a wonderful world isn't it..",

            "Unhappy people think that you need to keep pushing forward to be happy, but what they don\u2019t realize is that they\u2019re going to be unhappy no matter how hard they push or how far they may grow. There\u2019s nothing wrong with appreciating your life and being happy with where you are. I think that other people just want everyone to be as miserable as they are from overworking themselves",

He does very well financially and he and his wife have a beautiful home and family. Yet he is bummed out because his job is no longer challenging, he feels he has gone as far as he can and he can skate by with minimal effort.\n\nI told him \"dude you are living the dream. You've essentially hit the lottery. You can go to work, mail it in, and they pay you ridiculous money. Enjoy life! Immerse yourself in a hobby. There are is so much more to life than your work!\"",

The other lives in a fully paid for second house that the parents own. Neither works. Both are fully able-bodied, mentally and physically capable and with college degrees mind you. Neither is motivated to change the situation and the one at home likes to say things like 'money doesn't matter.'
