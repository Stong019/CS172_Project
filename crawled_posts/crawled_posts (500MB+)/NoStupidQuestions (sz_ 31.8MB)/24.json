            "This talk (https://youtu.be/ARosL9xrozk) by kate gregory made me start using my notebooks. She beat cancer and one of the things she said that resonated with me was \"use the soap\". The idea is that everyone keeps the nice soap and doesnt use it because there will be some future time that will be more perfect to use it. When you realise that time will never come, it frees you to use it. Notebooks became my soap. Ive started using mine. Thanks kate.",

            "I keep both notebooks and sketchbooks. The fear of accidentally spoiling a new sketchbook by doing an ugly sketch on the first, second or third page is constant and awful. Same goes for the notebooks, of course. You\u2019re definitely not alone. \n\nIn my sketchbooks I\u2019ve found that a neat trick to combat this is forgoing chronology. Instead of using up the pages going from the first to last, I open the sketchbook on any given blank page. This means I\u2019m not forced to look at a \u2018bad\u2019 page whenever I want to start a new drawing. \n\nDepending on the kind of writing you do, this could work in your notebooks too. I keep notebooks for creative projects, not journaling, so dating and chronology isn\u2019t that important. I color coordinate instead. \n\nIf you journal or your notes depend on chronology I don\u2019t have a concrete solution. But maybe consider why the appearance of your notebook is important to you? Are you planning on showing it to anyone? And if not, does it really matter if it\u2019s ugly?",

It's great for pushing creativity and killing off some perfectionism.",
            "I think most creative people have a problem like this or related to this. You have to break past that barrier and just put pen to paper. Don't worry about trying to filter things out, that can always be done later. It is better to have 10 'meh' stories with one real good one in there, than to have nothing at all. Preserve that fleeting thought or creativity. Sometimes, what you write may not feel very good at the time, but is actually much better than you think. Or more commonly, could serve as inspiration for greater works.\n\nIt's like taking photographs. Ask any legendary photographer how many pictures they take. Some of them take thousands to get just a few gems. Does that make them a lesser photographer? No!\n\nHow much garbage do you think Robert Frost, Ernest Hemingway, Mark Twain, or Mary Shelley churned out before and/or between their more well-known works? It may be more than you expect.\n\nSo write away, and while away the time with your scratchings. You haven't really anything to lose by it.",

            "I just read a \"meme\" a few hours ago, it said: *Don't skip over the little things. Later in life you might find out they were the big things* ^((Or something like that)) \n\nYou can always rip a page out so why not write it. You can keep it there for a day a week.. Or seven years.\n\nWhen I was into writing, I really enjoyed filling books. It became a thing of mine, I would find ways and words to stretch my stories and every page I filled gave me satisfaction. After a few years I had a solid stack of five books all with \"not good enough\" ideas and stories to be included in one.\n\nSeveral years after I put the pen away for the last time and hid my scratch books in a shoe box under the bed, I met a girl. For reasons not needed to be discussed here, we weren't able to spend a whole lot of time together back then and one great day she handed me a book while passing me in a hallway. No questions asked I took it home with me, to discover she wrote me a paragraph ending in an expectation of a reply. \n\nNaturally I took my pencil and wrote my heart out, realizing how much I missed having an outlet for my thoughts. We handed the book over to each other for the next few weeks, adding a paragraph each time. Sometimes a whole page, sometimes just a few lines. Until we ran out of space.\n\nIn the end we filled three or four books with correspondence, love letters if you will... We are happily married for five years and never argued, never fought. We are still reading each others' minds and all that is, I believe, because of the books.\n\nAnyway... Keep on writing, it might come in handy in an unforeseeable way later in your life. Even if only a therapeutic outlet. Not every writer is a good writer and not every good writer gets published. Do it because you love it and see where it'll lead you.",

I'd just get regular notebooks and then tape over them with duct tape, and then put a band sticker or something on them and label them the general story title I was working on.  Didn't have to stick with that story, if I wanted to write something else I just flipped it upsidown and started from teh back.\n\nIf the fanciness of the notebook is what's bothering you, as someone else suggested, I'd definitely say just get cheapo ones and make 'em your own.

Then two months ago I finally bought a fountain pen and figured I'd have the same problem of never using it as I don't think what I want to write is important enough.\n\nWhat I did to fix this was buy one of those refillable notebooks and a lot of paper. Now I can write in it and know that I have the power/freedom to take out the pages I don't want and/or add new blank paper as needed. For the fountain pen, I bought a pack of 5 ink refills so I know I can run out of ink and just change the cartridge easily.\n\nThese two months I've been feeling so happy and free to write any and everything I can think of in the notebook!",

You get better by doing.\n\nIf you can't bring yourself to write it down, remember that it isn't supposed to be good.  That's why you're putting it in a notebook, somewhere private, not online where others can see it.  So do it.  Write it down.  If this notebook isn't good enough, the next notebook will be better based on what you've learned.\n\nWho knows what your notebooks will look like in two years?

            "First page in my journals is always just the date it was started on the top. Over the year I usually write in a journal I\u2019ll usually add quotes, drawings, whatever. After that is two solid pages of ugliness. Scribbles and jazz. Just so I don\u2019t feel like the first thing I write has to be important.\n\nThen I skip a few pages for other stuff I might later want to put in the beginning, and then the journal begins. I start each entry with date, time, and a brief description of what the circumstances are like ( eg sitting in a park, just got off of work etc. )\n\nImportant things I like to remember. \n\n1.\tThis journal\u2019s purpose is to get my thoughts out. I have no obligation to write anything down, \n2.\tI don\u2019t have to catalogue every event in my life. I just unleash a stream of consciousness. This is so I don\u2019t get overwhelmed with having to write down everything that\u2019s happened to me or get overwhelmed when I skip days and feel like I have to write \n3.\tit\u2019s okay to skip days, weeks, even months. Journal is a tool to get my thoughts together. Whenever I feel like it I\u2019ll just scribble what ever is my head \n4.\tthis journal is not written for any reader. I write for the sake of it and don\u2019t let myself get bogged down with how a reader (even my future self) might react. It can incoherent nonsense or beautiful prose it doesn\u2019t matter \n5.\tnever ever erase or remove anything you write. No white out no pencils \n\nI\u2019ve been doing this since I was about 14. This means that I have about 6 journals full of how I was feeling. They are beautiful tapestries of ugliness and the fact that I never put any effort into making the pages look nice makes them all the more interesting \n\nLegit this style of journaling has been an extremely positive force in my life. I\u2019ve also tried bullet journaling but this seems to produce a lot of anxiety for me about how much needs to be done on it. I prefer my loose style of journaling with a smaller notebook with basic bujo task organization, but I try not to spend too much time on it\n\nI\u2019ve been using moleskin journals and though they are pretty expensive it\u2019s only a purchase I make every year or two. I also have a few volumes of stickerbomb, and some others that I\u2019ve been collecting that I use to decorate the outside. \n\nAlso I tend to number my pages when I feel like it. Doesn\u2019t take too long and helps to keep things organized. I usually add a section of numbered pages starting from the back as well to keep important stuff where I wanna find it.\n\nFinally I also usually pick up a cheap pen holder from amazon that attaches to the journal. Then with my favorite pen I can just toss it into my back pack and journal when I have a minute to myself",

            "Well, not a \"notebook,\" exactly, but back in the '60s, and up until this century, I always had a lined pad on a clipboard handy, with ideas, sketched-out scenes, and anything else that bubbled up in my brain in regard to writing fiction. \"Not good enough\" doesn't really make sense in that context. None of those notes and partial stories was ever for publication -- or even for showing to anyone else. The point was just to keep me from forgetting things. I kept all those pads, too. I had stacks of them in my file cabinet.\n\nEven when I sat down to actually write a story -- on an old office-model Underwood in the old days -- probably two out of every three attempts was never finished, and for a variety of reasons. That's to be expected and it never bothered me at all.\n\nEven now, writing on my laptop -- and using only MS Word, not some specialized \"writing software,\" which I've always regarded as a complete waste of time and money -- I have far more never-completed pieces on my hard drive than finished stories.\n\nI don't delete them, though, because I've actually gone back later and re-written and then finished a number of those temporarily abandoned attempts. And even if that never happens, I often steal useful ideas from those attempts for use in later stories.\n\nThe first moral of all this is, WRITING IS A PROCESS. \"Good enough\" doesn't enter into it. NOBODY writes a perfect story -- or even a perfect *sentence* right out of their head, with no editing or other changes.\n\nAnd the only way to learn to write something worth keeping is to just WRITE. Just keep doing it. Fill up that notebook and buy another one.\n\nThe second moral is, NEVER THROW ANYTHING AWAY.",

Then at one point my current boyfriend asked me to try on a coat and at first I refused because I couldn't afford it. I think he guessed that and said that he would gift it (I had been completely open with him about finances and how difficult it had been/still was). I struggled so much with that and felt terrible for even trying it on, but then I realized that I could actually pay for it myself! I had almost paid everything off and had financial wiggle-room for the first time in forever. He did buy it though because he insisted with the words \"it looks amazing on you and you really deserve it\".

Washing airplanes and sweeping hangars to pay for lessons. I started training seriously at age 19 and built thousands of hours teaching and flying small, light airplanes. When I got hired on as a private jet pilot, my first trip was to Cabo. As soon as I stepped off the airplane, I was in a foreign country, on my own and getting paid to be there...

            "A PS4. \n\nIt had been deeply ingrained into my brain that gaming consoles are luxury items that can only be obtained by \"real\" adults buying them for you as a combined birthday and christmas gift, and not the type of object you'd just go out and buy on a regular Tuesday, if you get what I mean? The last console I had was an xBox360 and that might as well have cost 1000 dollars given my personal financial state at that age. \n\n As a uni student I always had to make every dollar count and I completely gave up on gaming when my old xbox 360 broke down a year into uni, because I could never have afforded to replace it at the time. I had other interests so it wasn't a disaster, but I would miss gaming from time to time. \n\nA year ago I graduated and got my first fulltime job. The pay isn't great so I was in the mindset of still having to save money, but then I realised that regardless of the relatively low salary, I would still earn exorbitant amounts of spending money compared to what I had as a uni student. I live in a country with free education, so I didn't have any loans to pay off either. \n\nOne day I was home alone, bored out of my mind, when I saw an ad for the new Assassin's Creed game on PS4. At first I felt sad that I wouldn't get to experience it, but then I suddenly realized that there wasn't any actual reason why I couldn't walk down to the electronics store and buy the console and the game. 30 minutes later I was back home, with a PS4 and a couple of games.

Your bag rips and you need duct tape, don't pack a mini roll of duct tape, just go buy some. Batteries on your book light die, go buy some. Turns out you need a towel after all, go buy one. Even for more expensive things like shoes, if you need some special footwear, say hiking boots, you can just go buy some.\n\nThis for me is the key to packing light and it can also lead to some fun adventures. You get to see parts of wherever you are, that you might not normally see. Shoe shopping in Paris, or finding a drug store for toothpaste in brussles, or looking for a towel in japan are all mini adventures that most tourists don't experience. And they can also make for fun a souvenir.\n\nedit: And, for the most part, you (or at least I) don't need to buy anything, but its important to keep in mind you CAN and therefore can feel free to pack light.",

While I have been researching what I wanted to get, I found one that I liked and realized that I don't even need to put aside money for the next several months to be able to afford it; I could just go to the store and get it. It's a great feeling, especially since I used it and realized how much my 10$ garage sale vacuum was not picking up.",
            "I grew up in a small town. Like it took 30 minutes to drive to WALMART kind of small town. When I moved away for college I was amazed at the availability of food delivery, and this was before companies like Doordash and Grubhub were a thing. I remember the first time I got Domino's delivered and I was so happy lol. One time we even got Denny's delivered at like 2am because we were too drunk to drive, Uber wasn't a thing, and none of us had cash for a cab (they didn't take cards). Getting food delivered now just seems so normal, but it didn't back then.",

            "Pretty normal, I think. I did this a *lot* after I got my first job. After spending your first 16-17 years being prepared to have zero funds, not buying stuff is like a force of habit. Takes a while before you get used to having your own money.",
            "I had that realization when I left for college. I was sitting in my apartment one night around 10:00 and said, \"You know what'd be really nice right now? A bottle of chocolate milk.\" So I went out at 10:00 at night to buy a bottle of chocolate milk, and I didn't have to tell anyone, I didn't have to ask for permission, I could just do it.",
            "This is what happened the first time I went to the grocery store after the divorce began. My ex was diabetic and had no self control so I wasn't allowed to keep things in the house that would spike blood sugar. Things like chips, sweets, anything. For example, I once bought a box of Little Debbie snack cakes, they ate the entire box before bedtime, then chewed me out for buying them. So I'd get chewed out and not even get to enjoy them. That day I walked to the grocery store with the usual wheat bread and turkey patty list in mind when I realized I didn't have to buy that stuff anymore, then it further dawned on me that I could buy literally any food I wanted. I could buy noodles that weren't wheat, I could buy junk food, I could buy things I hadn't been allowed to have in 8 years! So yeah, I bought everything I missed and made myself miserable trying to eat it all the first night.",

            "As a teen and young man I was obsessed with synthesizers, but being a poor student the stuff I really wanted was out of reach. Then once I started making decent money I realized I could pretty much afford whatever I wanted, so I bought a shit load of instruments I never play (hello r/synthesizercirclejerk).\n\nBut it scratched the itch, and now I am slowly selling it off. No regrets.\n\nI also realized one time that \"Hey, I could buy a pellet gun if I want!\", but alas I live in an apartment in a densely populated city so there's nowhere I can shoot it. I'd probably shoot my eye out anyway.",

Just order a bunch of them\".   It took a minute to set in, and then I realized I could just get on Newegg and buy a case of them without thinking about it.",

When I was a kid we were never allowed to get KFC and I had a weird dawning realisation that I could indeed get whatever I wanted with my own money.",

I can just go and do it all on my own. \n\nAlso it's 10:30pm where I live and I have binge watched a TV show and not eaten since 1pm. So I'll go have something to eat now right before going to bed where I will continue reading my book. Those decisions always take a second for me to not feel weird and to realize that I can do whatever I want on my days off.",
            "Yes 100%! I\u2019ve had an issue buying things for myself and I recently got a job where I can very comfortably afford to buy things I want instead of need. Like, I bought a bag of smurf gummies just because I wanted them, didn\u2019t have a movie to watch or anything, I just wanted some gummies, it felt crazy!",
            "My mom has always been the type of person who would never go in a shop to browse. If she needs to buy something, she will go to the shop, buy that exact thing, then leave without looking round the store.\n\nIt blew my mind when I first realised I had pocket money and could go in a store *and not know what I wanted to spend it on*.",

            "For me, it\u2019s that I don\u2019t need to keep holding on to things that are old and maybe not working properly. I think it\u2019s because conservation is always at the forefront of my decision making and I don\u2019t want to be wasteful but I don\u2019t realize a lot of the time that I could spend $5 to replace something to make the process considerably less cumbersome. Or splurge and invest in something that would make something easier and last longer.",
            "Sort of related story: I went to a financial advisor after working for a few years to figure out what to do with my savings. We put it in an investment and set up recurring deposits off of each paycheque. After that I asked him: \u201cSo what should I do with the money I\u2019m not putting into savings?\u201d\n\nAnd he looked at me and said \u201cWell, you spend it.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve been saving money since I was a kid so I could afford college, then saving money in college to afford next year\u2019s tuition. Suddenly I was done school with a job and it never occurred to me that I\u2019m allowed to use the money I\u2019m earning. Money was never meant to be spent before, only saved.",

I mean, I love real food that's healthy but I don't HAVE to get it or limit myself  to that. I COULD BUY A WHOLE BOX of candy bars, but I don't so I have been patting myself on the back for a week.",

            "Yes! But my first realization was not really about buying stuff. \nI lived with my parents in a village up until a few months ago, even through university. So I always lived away from my friends and didn't go out much. \nin my last year of university, I was 23, I did a semester abroad in Germany and my dorm room was pretty close to the university, bars and other dorm buildings. \n\nWhen I realized I could just go anywhere whenever I wanted without depending on a car or rides or other people, it was shocking! I had traveled alone before but that was really the turning point.",
            "My sis and I went to an outlet mall and bought a bunch of stuff on sale. They gave us everything in those huge shopping bags. First time she did a big shopping like that.

            "Something about being able to get pretty much whatever I want kinda killed the magical revelation of it, for me. Prior to my 21st, I was so excited to finally be able to go buy my own alcohol on a whim, whenever and whatever I felt like having. Now, at 25, I argue with myself over whether or not it's really even worth spending money on. Unnecessary and trivial purchases are nearly *painful* now because it's my own decision to spend my own money.",

I've been a life long cinephile, but never gotten myself a proper sound system. Until I realised I can just buy one and so I did.",
            "It's a fantastic feeling. I got it in my late teens early 20's when I first moved out of home and again in my mid/late 20's when I started making decent money. It's a nice feeling. Also similar when I first got my license and just fuckin drove 7 hours to the nearest big city.",

            "A year after my husband and I were married (early 20s), we were discussing how we wanted to visit a college friend but really didn't want to sleep on an air mattress on the floor again because her apartment smells like cat piss. We slowly came to the realization that we're now adults, earning our own money, and can easily afford to stay in a hotel for a night.",
            "I think when people become adults and are able to buy the little things they like, they forget when they were kids the struggle of getting the things they want. Not just because of economic reasons (allowance, able to get money from odd jobs) but other circumstances (if you like video games but live in the pre internet era and don't have access to game magazines/rental stores so you don't know what games are good) and family rules (\"if you receive a present, you aren't allowed to exchange it for another one\" so if a well-meaning loved one gives you a present that sucks, too bad, you're stuck with it and have to wait months until you get another present).",

I grew up in an extremely frugal household (like - patching sheets with holes in them vs buying new ones, buying everything at Walmart or Kmart but only from the clearance aisle, yard sales, flea markets, etc. For me, realizing I made enough money to buy pretty much whatever I wanted from Target (mom would never shop there because she considered it overpriced) and pay *full price* was incredible. Really, once you can shop at target and not worry about the prices, what more can you ask for?\n\nEdit to add: she would also haggle with the Kmart check out clerks and try to get a cheaper price, like she\u2019d point out some small flaw and try to get a bigger discount. It was so embarrassing.",
            "I had this! My parents bought value versions of everything, and while I agree that some stuff it doesn't matter, there are other things, like non-powdered parmesan, or brand-name toilet paper, things that don't seem hugely different but man, make a difference to your quality of life!",

            "Yup as others have said it\u2019s called growing up poor! Imagine you just have it psychologically drilled into you for years that you can\u2019t just go buy something when you need it, until you work your way out of poverty and realise.... you can.",

            "For me it\u2019s sadly the opposite and too many times a day I think about the things I cannot afford or experiences I\u2019ll never have.  It just feels like such a ripoff that because you are poor you\u2019ll never get to enjoy the fullest life has to offer.  If I stop and think about the art, places and animals that I\u2019ll never see it makes me sad.  While other people are living a premium life, I\u2019m stuck with the low res version.

I'm working a really hard 12 hour split shift job at a plant, and get paid pretty well. I've been focused on paying off debt, a lot of which is credit card debt my husband has accrued. (Not a slight on him, we are both young and financially illiterate. Its a manageable problem, unlike my student loans. Hes been doing really well curbing his spending habits.) I've had self esteem issues my whole life from being overweight, and I found a clothing store that caters to plus sizes that are a little pricey, but good quality. I would lament that I wished I could dress a certain way, but that it was difficult because my whole life I dressed in clothes that were cheap and fit, not clothes I liked. (As the youngest of 4 daughters, but also the biggest in every way, let me tell you hand-me-downs were a nightmare.. so was goodwill shopping.) So this year, everytime I would mention there was a sale or that I needed a certain clothing item, my husband would push me to make a small order. Its been really fun getting clothes I like that also fit me! I'm actually starting to kind of like my own style and how I look. Just in time to never go anywhere!",

Then there's today as I'm sure most of North America is aware it's pretty chilly everywhere. It was in the teens(17f) over night. I still didn't wear a jacket to walk the dog, just pants and a t shirt. But I finally broke out a warm hat for my bald head.\n\nMy problem with masks is this. I've been having a hell of a time breathing when it's warm and I have to wear a mask. Even when I'm inside the grocery store where it's air conditioned I got very over heated. I was experiencing heat exhaustion from it. Last summer it would take me 8 hours to stop sweating even after getting back home and lying down. It's miserable.\n\nThis cold weather has been a nice reprieve. Even a week or two ago it got back up in the 70's and I was having trouble breathing with the mask again. I'm not looking forward to spring when it warms up again and down here that's coming fast.\n\nI am fat and that's probably part of the problem. I'm finally doing something about that. The goal is to be about 60 pounds lighter in four months. So far I'm on track for that. I hope that helps. Until then I will definitely enjoy what little cold weather we get.",

            "So I'm assuming the rule is I can't skip days, but there are no requirements of what I do in the room?\n\nIts not that hard to shift your sleep cycle.  It wouldn't be great to be sleeping on the floor but if you were doing that I think you could last quite a while\n\nYou are making 8 x $100 = $800 a day\n\n$800 x 7 = $5,600 a week\n\n$800 x 30 = $24,000 a month\n\nI think I could bang out a fair few month and put together quite a sum of money.\n\nEdit for more thoughts:\n\nOP gives more details [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/xqibik/comment/iq9c8gs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and in other replies (in particular saying yes to sleep and that it is a 9-to-5 shift)\n\nSo its $800 x 365 = $292,000 a year (less taxes?).\n\nSince you are sleeping, you could pursue some other form of employment in your off time. though that  might be more for the sake of keeping yourself busy than anything else, and you might be better off studying or otherwise preparing yourself for leaving this weird lifestyle you now live in the best possible position.\n\nThe more I think about this, the more it seems like someone who is young with few responsibilities could do this for quite a long period (perhaps years). I'm assuming that for the vast majority of people reading that the above income would be a major upgrade to their income.\n\nSo thinking of reasons you would stop taking this deal (not an exhaustive list):\n\n* Body Breakdown. I think sleeping on a bare floor is survivable for a long time.  Especially if you can afford help with massage and stretching etc.\n* Social Life.  This would wear on you.  You're missing 9 to 5 every day including weekends.  You'll be coming in late to weddings (likely just the reception) and parties etc.  I think if your friends were aware of your weird bargain they would play along but it would definitely be a negative\n* Medical Emergencies.  Either you or a loved one having a medical emergency is something that likely would break the streak.\n* Death of a loved one.  Again this is likely going to break your streak.\n* Family commitments.  So if you already had a partner and especially if you had young children this feels like it would make it a lot harder to pull off.  Especially if kid-related emergencies come up.\n* Traffic, or car problems.  This would be the super frustrating thing.  It sounds like OP intends that if you don't turn up on time it would break the rules and break the bargain.  Having something screw up so you can't *get* to this facility might eventually happen, especially if you are looking at doing this for the longer term (months or years)\n\nEdit for potential game changer. Do weekends exist in this scenario?\n\n* If we assume you can take weekends off the yearly income becomes roughly $208,000\n* But now you can lift a lot of the social life and family commitment pressures. It also means you can unlock some short travel opportunities (though that is playing with fire if something goes wrong)\n\nEdit for a question that is being asked\n\nIs there a bathroom? It sounds like the answer is no\n\n* Its an 8 hour shift where you are sleeping most of it\n* Getting through that without pooping should be quite feasible (if making for the occasional uncomfortable day)\n* With your lunch option you can add the option for relieving yourself in whatever held your beverage.\n\nEdit because it keeps getting said\n\n* Yes you should probably assume you would be taxed on this.  \n\nAnother Edit:\n\n* Yes the OP does not specify the time of day.  But if you look at OP's replies elsewhere (I linked one above) they do specify its a 9-to-5.",

Bright fluorescent lights 24/7. His post orders were to make sure the roll up door remained secure. He had a small podium for log paperwork and a stool to sit on. He wasn't allowed to look at his phone, bring a computer/portable screen/game, or even read a book. He never saw a soul other than another security guard who would relieve him for the minimum length breaks. And sometimes even those might be hit or miss depending on the shift. There was a camera pointed at him (for the loading dock, above his left shoulder). If he was caught on his phone or doing something he shouldn't be, he would be written up. After that it would be termination. \n\nHe did this for at least a year and a half (perhaps more, I lost touch) and it was just driving him slowly insane day by day. He became more erratic as time went on. He complained about it a lot. After awhile he started calling it torture. He was massively depressed, despite the medications he was taking that I knew should be helping more. Began thinking so little of himself (as in his image, self-esteem) and sought out things that made him feel alive. Luckily hard drugs didn't come into play as far as I know. But he had his primary sexual partner, his \"Master\" - who got off on controlling my friend. Dude seemed like a cool person, but I feel as if he was just using my friend.

            "You're watching movies that were released in 5.1 surround, but on a stereo system (like a TV, or computer speakers). The stereo system is doing a poor job of \"re-mixing\" the 5.1 sound for stereo. There's usually a setting for this on the TV or on the movie player (DVD player, games console, etc), usually called something like \"Speaker Setup\" or \"demux\" if it's a fancy player, and it'll let you choose between e.g. speakers, soundbar, headphones...\n\nIn a 5.1 movie mix, the dialogue is usually positioned in the front-centre speaker, because the dialogue is almost always happening on-screen and should take priority over anything else the audience hears. Music usually appears in the front-left and front-right speakers, and effects can come from anywhere. When a stereo system mixes those 5 speakers together, it usually just squashes the front-left and rear-left signals together, the front-right and rear-right signals together, applying \"compression\" to the signals. This isn't like MP3 compression, it's an audio effect that makes quiet sounds louder, but doesn't affect loud sounds. This is to make up for the fact that your TV speakers probably aren't as loud as the speakers in a cinema.\n\nIt then plays the centre signal across both speakers, but reduces the level of the centre signal to compensate for it now appearing in two speakers. And sometimes, the centre signal gets reduced too much, and is drowned out by the compressed music and effects, which results in the dialogue being hard to hear.\n\nBut like I say, your TV or player device or even things like VLC give you some control over how the 5.1 signal is mixed, and how much compression should be applied.\n\n---\n\nThis is now my most popular comment ever. Thanks for all the upvotes, and kind strangers for the awards. Here's some FAQs from my inbox:\n\n**I have a 5.1 surround system, and I still get this problem.**\n\nBoost the volume of your centre speaker. Ideally, get your system calibrated. If it was an expensive system, the shop that sold it to you should do this for you. If it wasn't expensive, there are online guides and phone apps that will help you.\n\n**But I thought audio compression made loud sounds quieter, not the other way around?**\n\nThere are two kinds of compressors. A _downward_ compressor is the more well-known, and people who are familiar with recording audio will be most familiar with downwards compressors. These do indeed work by attenuating the signal when it goes above a given threshold, i.e. making the loud sounds quieter. But they give a different character to the signal above the threshold, which is great for making a kick drum sound massive while ensuring that it doesn't clip the recorder, but it isn't what we want here. \n\nSince the signal from a DVD has already been recorded and mixed by a professional, we know that it sounds great, so we don't want to alter the peaks in the signal, we _only_ want to amplify the low level sounds. For that, we need an _upward_ compressor. This works exactly as I describe; by raising the level of signals below a given threshold, i.e. making quiet sounds louder. You hardly ever find them in recording studios, but they're very common in broadcast audio and in hi-fi devices, which is what you'd classify a DVD player as.\n\nNote that upward compressors are not just downward compressors with make-up gain. They're a completely different circuit design or algorithm.",

            "The only true solution is watching it at a medium volume and using subtitles",
            "There's a reason for this and it's awesome, but can lead to the problems you are facing. Movies - especially those mixed for cinema - have a greater dynamic range than eg TV. \n\nDynamic range = the difference between the quietest and loudest sounds in the audio recording. \n\nMovies make use of this to create more subtle, compelling and nuanced experiences. So for example, normal volume for quieter sounds like talking, but a gun shot is (as you'd expect) significantly louder. \n\nIn a cinema or a properly configured home system, this is awesome. At home it can be awesome too. If you're turning it down for your neighbours you have my full sympathy, but it actually frustrates me when people actively dislike the variation in volume personally - it's as much a part of the movie experience as the acting and the images. \n\nIf you are trapped by the need to be considerate for neighbours, as others have said, the thing you want is volume levelling. The technical term for this is a compressor/limiter. Both of these devices 'squash' the loudest peaks in the audio waveform, meaning essentially (and I'm simplyfing) that when you turn it up, the quietest parts get louder (so you can hear eg quiet dialogue) but the loudest parts don't. \n\nThere may be a software solution, if you have a proper home speaker hardware setup eg speakers+sub, you will easily be able to get a budget hardware solution for not much, then you can set the limiting settings to a good balance of keeping some of the dynamic range whilst reducing the worst excesses of volume.",

But before it could be mailed, the kidnapper saw what she did and tortured her, making her rewrite the letter while looking over her shoulder. \n\nHandwriting experts weren't able to deduce duress from the letter the kidnapper sent, and no one was sure if she was being held against her will or not. So how could one communicate duress secretly in a letter like that?

            "Security professional here. \"Duress\" codes are probably the best way to solve this. When working a job in which certain people were given access to room with sensitive materials, everyone was issued two PINs for the PIN+badge access to the room. A regular PIN which would grant access and a \"duress\" PIN that would grant access and also set off a silent alarm to the security ops center.  \n\n\nSimilarly, work out with your loved ones ahead of time a duress code, phrase, or idea. Some folks in the thread have mentioned this technique already, but I'd suggest not posting it anywhere publicly. Someone who cares enough to kidnap a person probably cares enough to check their social media. And if they discover the duress phrase, it becomes useless or, even worse, dangerous to use.  \n\n\nAlso, good duress codes should have the same visual effect as legit codes. In the case of duress phrases then, these should chosen to be things that appear innocuous. Mentions of trips with a person that never happened or of favorite foods that aren't their favorite food. Example: \"I hope some day we can meet up again and eat the great fried olives at that place in Madras Oregon\" when you've never been to Madras with the person and the person hates fried olives.",

            "Oh just remembered how my Aunt did this. She was car-jacked and forced to drive to her bank. This was before branch banking in Texas. So her bank was actually in a small town outside of Houston. The kidnapper made her go through the drive-thru and withdraw money. Now my Uncle was a home builder and it wasn't unusual for my Aunt to go through the drive-thru and withdraw large sums of money with different workers in the car. She would then go to the supplier and pay cash on the barrel head. The workers were there because Uncle didn't want her carry large sums of money alone.\n\nLuckily this was a small town bank - and they knew my Aunt. She goes through the commercial line and has a conversation with the teller. In that conversation - she calls all three of her girls by their formal you are in trouble names - not the nickname they go by. My Uncle's legal name is usually a nickname -she referred to him by the formal version that isn't his name. She asks after the teller's family switching their names around. The teller gets the manager, who Aunt knows very well. She calls him by the wrong name. They tell her it will take a minute could she pull up in front of the bank and they will bring the cash out to her. They were actually calling the cops. \n\nMeanwhile, the kidnapper is getting nervous and careless. Aunt knocks the gun out of his hand - jumps out and runs to the door. They slam the door shut and set off all the alarms. Cops come and the bad guy is caught.\n\nAfter everything was over and the cops were gone, my Uncle walks into the bank. They rush over to tell him my Aunt is ok - and of course, he didn't know anything about it because cell phones were decades in the future.   \n\n\nAunt and Uncle were Silent Generation - Don't buy things on credit types. So he was in and out on almost a daily basis, so his arrival at the bank wasn't that unusual.",

When his kidnappers call his brother Sam, Dean remarks that he's in a place, and describes it as a, \"funky town\". That statement was a code for someone having a gun on him.\n\nWhat would be ideal is you working with someone close to you to develop innocuous words or statements to mean certain things. Such as, \"I'm heading to a different place to start anew\". \"Anew\" could be your key word for your being forced into a situation you're not able to get out of.\n\nOr, write that you're, \"traveling to somewhere different\". \"Different\" can be code for you being forcibly confined.\n\nCoded conversations are very common, but they take a lot of time to practice.

There are a lot of complexities in the tax law; most of these probably don't apply to you (or you wouldn't be asking this question), but the government cannot make that assumption. Also, the idea that you would be punished for miscalculating your tax liability is a myth. If you made a calculation error they will recalculate it based on the information you gave them and inform you of the correction.

It's hard to describe but I just feel more _strongly_  and subtly, to a degree I've never experienced in waking life. The setting doesn't really matter, it can be a relatively mundane dream setting but I've felt more absolute fear and more ecstatic love and peace than anything the waking world has rendered me. I don't know if this is a result of some self contained dream logic and rules, or if my mind just lets its wings truly unfurl only when I'm dreaming, but the disappointment on coming back to dreary reality is always a kick in the teeth.\nIt passes/I make myself shake it off after half an hour or so though.",

I kept repeating, \"I love you Dad, I love you\". \"Oh, I love you too,\" he responded, putting his arms around me. \n\nAt some point in my dream, I thought I heard my husband ask \"Are you okay?\"\n\nWhen I woke up the next morning, I asked my husband if had in fact asked me that, and he said \"I did! It sounded like you were crying.\" But I never woke up or responded to him; I just kept crying into my pillow. I guess the dream was just too wonderful to leave. \n\nSometimes I dream about my Mom too. It's so depressing to wake up and remember they're gone.",

But then I \u2018woke up\u2019 from that dream and it was a few years before he was diagnosed. I thought I\u2019d had a premonition so got on the phone and called my dad telling him all about this horrible dream I\u2019d had and to go and see a Doctor straight away, to catch it before it starts to grow and spread. I was happy that I thought I\u2019d probably saved his life. And then I properly woke up, confused about what had happened and then the reality hit that he\u2019d been dead already for over a year.

            "TL:DR - I dreamed last night that I was in a bar and the cute girl I flirted with came back in to have me ask for her number, but I knew right then it was a dream and woke myself up.\n\nI always have weird dreams, so here goes: I was in a store that looked like a Restoration Hardware, but in my mind it was a bar. There were 3 girls by a window that I passed by who smiled and looked at me. I said something to make them giggle, but I can't remember what. I needed a shower so I walked into the glass shower stall (in the RH showroom and I was now in a robe), but wanted to re-align the sliding door so I took it off the rails and got on a ladder (suddenly appearing) to fix it. While I was atop the ladder and leaning over the door,  I had the glass in my hands and was trying to place it on the roller track. \n\n I saw the 3 girls get up and walk out the door. But then one of the girls comes back in just as I was struggling. She talked to me like we were just \"hanging out\" but I was aware that she was likely there to get me to ask for her number. I hung the door and stepped down the ladder and then sat down next to a couple Asian men (??) and started talking to her. I was aware that I had a robe on, so I shut my legs from fear of \"manspreading\" not to mention having my participles dangle. But I very quickly ran out of things to say. \n\nI knew I should just ask for her number, or even just give her mine. I also knew that something was \"off.\" I searched my brain for a great reason to ask for her number, but none came. I couldn't even say \"here's my number, call me.\" We both stood there (she stood, I sat) during a loong awkward pause. That's when I realized it was a dream and I was just as awkward in the dream as in real life. SO I told myself \"Just wake up, cuz this is hard to watch, much less be the subject of.\" \n\nAnd I did wake up, suddenly realizing I was having a lucid dream and could have changed it to whatever I wanted, but all I wanted was to get out of there. In my head I was telling myself \"DUDE, WTF?!\"",

Here\u2019s a CNN [article](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2023/06/22/us/submersible-titanic-oceangate-search-thursday/index.html). \n\nThey may already be dead for a few reasons. \n\n1) The sub had 7 different safety features meant to pull it back to the top in case something happened. Quite a few of them were designed to activate automatically after 14 hours even if the crew was passed out. None of these features activated not even the emergency beacon that was supposed to shoot up to give away its location. For all 7 features to fail, something big had to happen to the sub. The most likely case is that something happened to the hull when it went down and the sub imploded when they lost communication. If it imploded, it was a quick death and probably instant. A mercy. \n\n2) Someone who\u2019s worked on submarines before pointed out that subs or submersibles need CO2 scrubbers. When you breathe out air, you push out CO2 that needs to be cleaned out in a confined space. The sub had scrubbers, but they were probably not enough to withstand multiple days given how small they were to fit in the sub. If that was the case, they ran out of clean air a while ago and likely died from CO2 poisoning. \n\n3) The sub was apparently supposed to get super close to the wreck. If something went wrong, there\u2019s a possibility the Titanic\u2019s debris caved around them trapping them. This would also explain why the safety features didn\u2019t activate. If they were trapped, they will never be freed. There is no technology able to pull them out (edit: pull them out before oxygen runs out).\n\n4) They have about 11 hours of oxygen left and people still don\u2019t know their location. If by some miracle they were found right this second, then what? There\u2019s no technology to retrieve them or even go down 13,000 feet readily available now. There\u2019s only a handful of subs that can withstand that pressure and the Titan is one of them. If they\u2019re stuck there, all rescue efforts can do is watch them suffocate. If they made it to the surface, they can\u2019t free themselves because they were bolted from the outside. It\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll be found in time. \n\n5) Finally, they could have died freezing to death. It\u2019s likely their power died. They\u2019re in water that can get to 39F and in pitch darkness with no sunlight able to reach them. Those are temperatures that can cause hypothermia with no heating of any sort (edit: Fixed 32F to 39F and took out freezing). They were also not allowed to take shoes because of how cramped everything was, so I doubt they had blankets or anything to keep them warm. They could have died from the cold way before now. \n\nAn expert (Don Walsh) interviewed on TV was asked if there was a chance for their survival / finding and he bluntly said, \u201cNo.\u201d It\u2019s likely they\u2019re already dead. Best case scenario is that they imploded hours into their voyage and died quickly before they even realized what happened.",

The fact that there hasn't been any reports of a buoy means that they either never had one (which from some of the stuff I've been reading about in the last 48 hours is a distinct possibility as this submersible seems pretty 'Heath Robinson' to say the least) or they had one but had no opportunity to release it...\n\neither way, that was the moment in my mind (on Monday) that I thought that this was a long term recovery operation rather than a search and rescue, as morbid as that seems.",
