            "There is already a program like this on BBC.  I can't remember what it's called.  But it takes families who are wealthy and ones living in poverty and switch them.  Its very entertaining, but not like \"ha ha\" or outrageous like US reality programs.  It's actually more real reality.\n\nMost of the time the rich family admits that they really had no idea how hard it was to live like that, and often they offer to help get the poverty family a better job and stuff.  One even funded the startup costs for the husband in the poverty family to start his own business, and that made a huge difference in their life.",
            "This might backfire. It's like the song \"Common People\". They have no real risk because they can go back. Part of poverty is the constant anxiety that if something goes wrong (the refrigerator breaks, the car crashes, you lose your apartment, you need a minor but expensive surgery) it is disastrous. They wouldn't have that. They would still think in the end \"well they can just change to a different better job\" or \"they should just go to college\".",

The book tells the story of what she went through. It was very insightful and sad. There was no need to bring in mean supervisors, they already were mean ones in real life.

This idea comes from a poor (hah) understanding of why poverty sucks.\n\nBeing poor is so much more than the day-to-day indignities of a minimum wage job, although that's part of it. Living hand to mouth changes the way you think about your future. The wealthy, knowing they have a future of security and plenty, would never understand the constant anxiety of the poor. Being poor means you live one accident away from complete bankruptcy. Poverty is defined by precariousness, not just actual material impoverishment. Nothing about an artificially constructed TV set is precarious.\n\nI also can't imagine something worse than like, Jeff Bezos, managing to live frugally for the duration of the show then be like, \"See?

You just need to know the law.  \n\nThe reason we choose lawyers is because lawyers know certain areas of the law better than just about everyone else. But if you know, for instance, that it's against your state's Revised Statutes to withhold an impartial first full paycheck until the second pay period of employment (you know that sly trick they try to pull), then you can bring a suit against your employer for improper payment of wages. Cite that ordinance, and it won't matter how much your employer spent on lawyers, because the law is the law and you win.  \n\n/r/legaladvice was likely intended to be a hub for individuals to share their own valid experiences with the law as situations arose. For example, I am exceptionally familiar with federal employment law and said laws in four states by sheer virtue of having been an employer, and I know rental law in one of those states because I have had to twice successfully bring suit against landlords. It would be nice if I happened upon a post where some kid was having his paycheck held because a drawer came up short, and I could tell him he wasn't responsible for it because the laws in his state are written a certain way, *and be able to cite the law*. That was the intent.  \n\nThe reality is \"OMG TREE LAW\" and \"You've already said too much, get a lawyer\"",

So simply by answering a stranger's question on the internet would create an ethical, legal and professional obligation that could cost the lawyer their license and their livelihood if they screw it up.

You can even see this on the elementary school playgrounds. The girls are more likely to be in a group talking to each other while the boys are more likely to be doing stuff (sports, play fighting, climbing on stuff, etc.). This is also probably the reason why conflict between boys is often more violent, while conflict between girls is more psychological. \n\nThis difference could just be from societal norms pushing boys & girls down certain pathways, or it could be something biological.

It\u2019s not seen as masculine or manly to show emotion, or emotional intelligence. These are traditionally seen as feminine qualities. Qualities that could get a straight man labeled as gay or otherwise marked as unmanly and ostracized in many social and dating circles. Men are taught it\u2019s weak to show emotion, talk about feelings, or express platonic love for their friends (especially male friends) in the form of genuine interest and care. \n\nSince building the courage to be myself and practicing starting conversations and sharing a bit about what\u2019s going on with me, I have built strong, genuine connections with other guys and am so much happier for it. I have also been told by friends that the space I build through sharing and asking genuine questions helps them share and be themselves too. \n\nGuys do ask questions, and want to. Not asking questions isn\u2019t inherent to men, it\u2019s learned and expected behavior.",

My mom somehow got the conversation gene and always asks perfect questions - she should have been an interviewer like Larry King. But I just... forget.

It\u2019s hard to articulate but essentially if two guys are in a conversation and they want to keep it going, they don\u2019t really do it by asking follow-up questions back and forth. \n\nIn some conversations with women it can be weird being asked follow-up questions as a courtesy because a lot of guys don\u2019t think of it as a courtesy.

            "**I remain convinced the Empire of Japan is the most evil regime in human history** and worse than Nazi Germany in terms of pure cruelty. Their atrocities just aren't talk about much anymore because Japan is so well liked now in the West.\n\nThe indiscriminate massacre of civilians. Slaughter of entire cities, torture, inhumane treatment of POWs, countless women forced into sexual slavery, among others.\n\nOver their conquest of East Asia, the Japanese Army forced around 200,000 women into the ranks of \"comfort women\". These women mainly came from China, Korea, and the Philippines. This is the only thing I could not find a source for, but I distinctly remember reading the firsthand account of a Filipino comfort women who was **raped 10x a day**. Japan has yet to even officially apologize to them. On the contrary, there was an uproar in Japan when the South Korean prime minister asked for an apology for Japan. They were angry that Koreans would even bring it up.\n\n*You think that's the worst?* During the Rape of Nanking, as many as 300,000 Chinese civilians were massacred within a month in a single city. Japanese soldiers paraded around with babies skewered on their bayonets like kebabs. Two Japanese officers held a competition to see who could behead 100 people the fastest and when the score was 105-106 and no one knew who got to 100 first, they went again to 150. Civilians were buried alive en masse. Prisoners were used as **live bayonet practice**, screaming as the final moments of their life was used for the Japanese to sadistically torment. Tens of thousands of women were raped, most of whom were executed afterward. They dragged entire Chinese families into public squares and **forced fathers on their daughters and sons on their mothers** for the amusement of Japanese troops. I'm not an easily disturbed guy, but reading this fact for the first time physically made my stomach sick.\n\n*You think that's the worst?* The Imperial Japanese Army ran Unit 731: a state-of-the-art biological/chemical warfare research facility in Manchuria where Japanese researchers performed human experimentation on a large scale, using Chinese civilians as the majority of their \"logs\" (test subjects).\n\nLiving humans were **dissected alive**, usually without anesthesia. Subjects had limbs amputated in order to study blood loss and pain tolerance. Those limbs were sometimes reattached to the opposite sides of the body. Subjects had their stomachs or esophagus surgically removed. Subjects were gotten pregnant via rape then infected with diseases to see the effect on their baby. Subjects were forced into the cold to research frostbite then had their frozen limbs chopped off. Subjects were placed in pressure chambers until their eyeballs popped out of their sockets. This one is unconfirmed, but supposedly they placed a women and her baby in a room then heated up the floor to see if she'd step on her own baby.\n\nPerhaps the most disturbing part about it all that Japanese soldiers were enjoying it; they were killing for sport.\n\n*Everyone cries over the civilians of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but no one sheds a tear for the millions of victims of the Empire of Japan.*\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nI had spent 30 minutes linking sources to back up literally everything I said up here, but every time I tried to include the proof, it was removed. I wonder why.\n\nAnd it's disappointing because I promise you this clunky, colorless wall of essay-like text hits **1000x harder** when you actually visually see the victims of Imperial Japan; the mountains of bodies, lifeless babies, the terrified/depressed expressions on civilians' faces contrasted by the grins on the Japanese soldiers faces as they torment them. \n\n\n\nComment by u/baiqibeendeleted17x\n\n\nEdit: Instead of getting in your feels and arguing with me why don't some of yall educate yourselves on these atrocities first... \n[HERE](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_war_crimes) this should clear a few things up.",

            "Study your history. There WAS great debate and division over the use of the bomb. You basically answered your own question: the laws didn't exist. And ALL parties involved bombed civilians. An estimated 65% of all ww2 casualties were civilian. Many, many of the scientists responsible for the academic and physical production of the bomb were very much against its use. But probably (the most accepted) factor in Truman's decision to use it was to SAVE (american) lives. Based on the tenacity of Japanese soldiers and thier sheer devotion to the Emperor, and the experience of fighting them in the pacific theater for several years, a conservative estimate of the cost of invading the Japanese homeland was 1 million casualties.  The taking of just a bunch of little islands in the pacific was COSTLY. They literally fought tooth and nail to the end. The taking of Japan would have been (and most likely remain forever) the bloodiest conflict ever.  Keep in mind that Hiroshima and Nagasaki WERE military targets (few military targets anywhere have a concrete and defined delineation between civilian and military layouts). And they were warned ahead of time to get out, but disbelief was widespread. So when you look at it in that context, it WAS justified.  It's a fine line to be sure, but it was the less deadly means to an end (an absolutely necessary end). But my view on it is simplistic and the one shared by most people- if it wasn't for Pearl Harbor, it never would have been necessary.  They decided their own fate on Dec.7. Even half a world away, did a tiny ass island nation really expect to be victorious over the vast reserves of resources USA had access too? Gotta hand to the Japanese though for having great big giant balls: they were aggressive to China and USA. Between the two, a major part of the resources of an entire planet were under control but they didn't let that intimidate them. HUGE balls.",

We also didn\u2019t fully understand the impact of nuclear weapons back then.

One of the lower estimates put the number of victims at 220,000, which includes 150,000 prisoners of war.  Estimates have been as high as 500,000. \nThe atrocities were so bad that even the Nazis present in Nanking reportedly complained   \n\nThe combined death toll for Nagasaki and Hiroshima was approximately 105,000. The injured is estimated at 95,000. The Japanese were the initial aggressors and committed terrible atrocities through out the war. One of which was burning prisoners of war alive rather than free them, as the Japanese began retreating. \n\nThet nuclear bombs were used to bring about the surrender of an extremely cruel and barbaric military campaign is in no way a war crime but a justified and reasonable action that the Japanese brought on themselves.  \n\nIn Nanking, the Japanese were the invading aggressors.",

Nope then dropped the second  finally several days after the second one they surrendered\n\nWhy do you feel they should be punished for it? Have you looked at how many citizens died in bombing of cities both in Japan and Europe?",
            "War crimes are laid out in the Geneva Conventions. These treaties were initially agreed to in 1929 and then updated and added to in 1949. It was in 1949, after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki that the language about bombing largely civilian targets was added. So when these bombings happened, they weren't considered war crimes.",
            "I'm not downplaying the effects of that at all. That does fit the bill of the definition. But it could be argued that doing that was the only realistic way to make the Japanese surrender, and end the war that could have raged on. I'm not saying that's not a war crime, but it was done to prospectively bring about more good, overall, than what was happening already. While Putin attacked Ukrainian civilians to fuel his ego, to make a baseless crusade to take land that he thinks is his. \n\nSo, a war crime, but probably less important to point out since it was the most efficient way the government envisioned ending the war. Was for a good purpose in the end, but I'm sure there were other methods that could have worked, too.",
            "Yes. However they changed the rules post ww2 to ensure no one else could use their playbook",
            "The US actually tried to minimize civilian casualties when the bombs were dropped by airdropping pamphlets warning civilians ahead of time . It was the Japanese government that told the civilians to stay trying to use them as a human shield. \n\nThe Japanese Air Force actually tracked one of the bombs on its way to its destination via radar/sonar. It was the emperor, I believe the Air Force to not let anyone know that the bomb was on its way when there was still plenty of time to evacuate. There was this documentary that I watched where a victim of the bombing read the instructions not to let anyone know, and he just sat there stunned and asking why.",
            "Dresden bombing often gets left out of this, but it really should be included. Imagine trying to run away from a bombing, but the fire storm created sucks in so much oxygen you are sucked back into it.",
            "In addition to everyone else saying we did more damage with our previous bombing campaigns, one thing I've heard is that the way the Japanese were fighting, they would probably fight to the last man, woman, or child in defense of the Emperor.  This is similar to finding someone who'd been living in hiding in the jungles for decades and assumed the war was still on.

Had we continued to use conventional bombing instead, then far more civilians would have died for a lot longer.    \n\n\nThe other issue is the other option available, a full scale land invasion.  Look at the fights that happened to take islands like Iwo Jima or Okinawa.  In those instances, almost every last Japanese soldier had to be killed before the island was taken by the Americans, and those left committed suicide.

            "The use of nuclear weapons on any population - civilian or otherwise - is one of the single greatest travesties in human history.\n\n200,000 dead in the blink of an eye and the will of an entire empire to keep fighting died with them.\n\nDifferent reports make bold assertions that as many as 32 million lives were saved, a combination of Allied and Japanese causalities.  But even if the use of the weapon only prevented a further 1,000,000 casualties it still saved exponentially more than it destroyed.  We were losing the war in the South Pacific at the time.  The [massacre committed by the Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing_Massacre) in mainland China was a very real threat to other populations if the Japanese started gaining ground again.  Other powers were simultaneously developing the weapon.  If a first-use could forestall future uses by men and governments who would not so scrupulously select targets and judiciously use them... then... I don't know.  It all feels so devoid of reason and hope.  Just an empty pit of despair.  The Empire of Japan was pure evil and something was broken in them.  They HAD to be stopped. \n\nNuclear weapons are abominable and I wish it had never been created.  I wish it didn't exist.  The law of land warfare is an acceptable standard by which moral combatants can hold themselves to adhere.  But ultimately war is war.\n\nBut look at what is happening on the world stage now.  It is all repeating.  There is no hope for the human race.  And maybe that is fine. Maybe we don't deserve hope anymore.",

            "Short answer yes, long answer maybe not.\n\nUndoubtedly killing civilians is a war crime. However, there are a few points that made the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki more understandable.\n\nFirstly, as others have said war crimes/crimes against humanity weren't really defined prior to WWII. The Holocaust provided rationale for the creation of these laws.\n\nSecondly, this was not the first instance of attacks on civilians during WWII. Both Axis and Allied powers had attacked civilians previously. The two nukes were just more well known for obvious reasons.\n\nThirdly, and perhaps most importantly, the two nukes ended the war. Japanese culture is one of honor, and soldiers had been trained as such -- not unlike that of Sparta. Victory over everything -- Japanese soldiers routinely fought with little regard for their own lives (see: Kamikaze). As such, when the other Axis powers had surrendered, there was no indication that Japan meant to do the same. The U.S. made the gutsy (depending on how you look at it) decision to drop the two bombs as a demonstration of power. Truman was essentially saying \"surrender now, look at our power, you have no chance of winning this war.\" It worked, as the Japanese surrendered very quickly after. \n\nAnd so there are many reasons for which the dropping of the two nukes was not so rash. The actual death toll from the two bombs was not all that high, in the grand scheme of things. Perhaps the American thought process was that Japan isn't going to surrender, fewer lives would be lost overall if we're to drop these two bombs right now as opposed to allowing the war to continue.",

            "A lot of people already gave you the correct answer but it is worth noting that in Japan in ww2, the Japanese were preparing for an all or nothing outcome. They were training children and women with bamboo stakes to fight US invaders to the death. When US troops took Okinawa, thousands of civilians attacked them suicidally and many families committed suicide. It really shook the U.S. troops how fanatical they were. Soldiers simply would not surrender in Japan. If the U.S. continued island hopping, many more hundreds of thousands would have died including more civilians and troops on both sides. Hell, it even took more than one atomic bomb to get them to surrender. We showed them we had the capability to remove a city from the map and they still refused.

            "I used to think that dropping those bombs was unforgivable. But you should see what the Japanese had planned to do to defend the home island. They were arming women and children with spears and one-shot, disposable guns. They had plans for underwater suits that would essentially suicide bomb landing craft from below.\n\n If you think that it'd never have come to that you should see what happened on some of the islands the Americans took. Particularly Saipan, where Japanese civilians would join in banzai charges with nothing but simple weapons, and the aptly named suicide cliff, where, despite American assurances that they would be unharmed, mother's threw their children and themselves off the cliff rather than face the \"shame\" of surrendering to the Americans. Thousands took part in mass suicide. They were completely brainwashed by Japanese imperial propaganda.\n\nI think that if the Americans had launched a landing of mainland Japan, you could easily have seen similar civilian casualties, if not more. And that's not even counting the army casualties on both sides.\n\nSo by today's standards, it would still be a war crime. But I no longer think it was unnecessary.",

            "[deleted]",
            "A lot of brief answers for a very complicated question. Some people are giving a literal answer that war crimes laws didn\u2019t really exist when this was done. IMO that\u2019s a simplistic answer that ignores the debate and question that took place at the time and afterwards that is still relevant. There are many moral issues to consider in answering this, and I do not believe there is a cut and dry answer. Generally speaking, DURING WWII, one of the prevailing doctrines was that when you\u2019re at war with a nation state that is pouring a huge proportion of its production capacity to war production, the civilian populous becomes a legitimate target. The civilian population is manning factories churning out guns an tanks and planes. Therefore, to stop that production, bombing civilians will result in disruption of the war effort. Multiple governments during WWII targeted civilian centres, including the British and Germans, for what was called \u201cmoral bombing,\u201d or \u201cdehousing\u201d in order to turn the populations attitude toward giving up or ending the war effort in order to get it to stop. Importantly, though, they used conventional explosives and incendiary bombs, or bombs that started fires. In short, by bombing civilians, they can\u2019t work to make weapons for soldiers to fight and they probably would want to quit. \nThe American doctrine in the early parts of the war differed to a large degree, in that the military commanders of the bomber forces wanted to use pinpoint accurate bombing to take out critical infrastructure without causing large amounts of collateral damage. Their idea was that if you could find a specific choke point for war production, and deny it, you didn\u2019t have to bomb civilians en mass. A specific example of this was the US targeting of ball bearing factories. In Europe, the US objected the the use of their forces to bomb civilians and instead pushed for them to be used against these specific war industries, despite there being much, much greater risk to their bombers and the soldiers who flew them. During WWII, given the available technology, this doctrine was unsuccessful, and some historians have argued that both of the above doctrines were extremely wasteful. \nJump over to Japan: by the time the Americans were able to fly bombers all the way to the main islands of Japan the idea of targeted bombing was basically on its last legs. They tried on some aircraft factories but for a variety of reasons it just didn\u2019t work. So the US switched to firebombing of civilian targets using a new weapon invented specifically for destroying Japan: napalm. This was even before the atomic bomb was available. The US burnt down many, many acres of Japanese cities using napalm. It was devastating. More people died in the firebombing of Tokyo than even in the atomic bombings. Then, the Manhattan Project succeeded and the US had a weapon that no one else had. For a variety of reasons, they were motivated to use it.\nFor one, they had been firebombing Japanese cities for months, killing hundreds of thousands of civilians and leaving swaths of the cities in ash. Yet still, the Japanese government fought on and did not surrender (under the terms the US had stipulated; which was unconditional surrender). There was a propaganda campaign by the Japanese government that the entirety of the nation would die defending the islands, rather than face the humiliation of surrendering. They trained women and kids in hand to hand combat and put up posters glorifying the sacrifice of ones life to prevent occupation. The US government believed that, realistically, they could expect 1,000,000 casualties in US servicemen in taking the islands of Japan. Couple that with the idea that they might have to kill a majority of civilians in conventional warfare, and the idea of accomplishing the same thing with a super-weapon that risked zero American lives looked pretty appealing. \nThere are also speculations about the motivation of the US government to intimidate other potential adversaries, including the Soviet Union, but these are less cut and dry. \nFinally, given the condition of the Japanese armed forces at the time, a suitable target consisting ONLY of Japanese armed forces didn\u2019t really exist. Most of the peripheral bases the Japanese military held were already defeated. Other major targets had been burned to ash by the firebombing. In order for the demonstration to be meaningful, all that was really left were unburned cities with major military garrisons WITHIN them. Hiroshima and Nagasaki fit the target description. They were intentionally left undamaged by firebombing as well, in order to make the atomic bombings efficacy more apparent. \nThere are volumes of fascinating history on this subject. I\u2019ve only scraped the surface. Was it a war crime WHEN IT WAS DONE? Not really, as others have pointed out, the definition of war crime didn\u2019t really exist as a concept that governments abided by, and just about everyone was bombing or targeting civilians. Is it a war crime in RETROSPECT? That\u2019s a moral and ethical question that is still debated.",

Literally thousands of bombers would fly over a city each dropping 50+ bombs on whatever was under them. The a bomb was just more efficient.",
            "My great grandmother has explained to me what happened that President Truman (a very humble and honest president I might add) justified using the nuclear bomb. U.S. generals estimated that an all out invasion of the Japanese archipelago would lose at least 100k American lives. They didn't want this and the Japanese govt refused to surrender before the 1st bomb and before the 2nd, despite not having any chance left. While the human cost to the U.S. of WWII was much less than for the Soviets, many Americans had lost or mentally lost (PTSD) someone close to the way, in ways I think hard for us Americans nowadays to understnad.\n\nThe U.S. wanted to minimize its own losses. Also, the full effects of the bomb on people's health was not known ahead of time. Now it is, so any future users of nuclear bombs cannot ignorance.\n\nWhile I think the U.S. military has definitely committed war crimes (including 20th+21st centuries), I am reluctant to classify the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as war crimes. Remember also that Japan attacked the U.S. at Pearl Harbor completely unprovoked. I think it kinda does matter who \"starts\" it",

So we went ahead and dropped another. This basically broke them. The leadership in Japan would have had to be to animals not to give in. \n\nTLDR. Being reasonable and more respectful of the Japanese culture would have likely led to a shorter war in the east and saved thousands of lives. \n\nUltimately we did it because we could.",

            "The term \"African-American\" was [introduced by Rev. Jesse Jackson](https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/31/us/african-american-favored-by-many-of-america-s-blacks.html) in the 1980s, who felt that the term \"blacks\" to describe this demographic was too racist and had picked up too many negative connotations.  He wanted a new term to help the black/African-American community to recapture their racial heritage.  The term has since become so ingrained in American discourse that we started to use the \"X - American\" construct for other ethnicities as well, but like Jesse Jackson it is usually because we feel an existing term has too many bad connotations.\n\nEdit: Several people have pointed out that the term \"African-American\" has appeared in writing earlier, even [going back to the 19th century](https://yalealumnimagazine.com/articles/4216-the-origin-of-african-American), with one citation found [as early as 1782](https://www.nytimes.com/times-insider/2015/04/21/the-term-african-american-appears-earlier-than-thought-reporters-notebook/) (hat tip to /u/lithographia).  However, it is still accurate to say that it only became a household term in America after Jesse Jackson began his efforts to introduce it into the public lexicon, and most people did not use the term in conversation before he popularized it.",
            "In Canada I've never ever heard African Canadians",
            "Note that there are black people from Asia, pacific islands, the Caribbean, and South America. Calling black people \u201cAfrican Americans\u201d is silly and often not representative of their heritage.",
            "If a black person knows what country they\u2019re from then you can call them that (Nigerian American, Ghanaian American, etc). African American usually refers to the descendants of slaves who don\u2019t know their ethnicity.",
            "I think it\u2019s funny most people have honed in on explaining the term African-American with zero explanation of why the term European-American doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nMight have been better to state the question as: Why do we say Asian-American, African-America, Native-American, but not European-American?",
            "Well most of the minorities are distinguished. As the United states is something like 78% euro-american, you don't need to be distinguished. It's not just African American. There is Latin American, I'm native American etc. But we are all American and that is the important part. ",
            "What's odd is I have a friend and his wife who are white and moved here to the states from South Africa, they really are African-Americans.  It sort of makes the whole thing seem kinda silly to me.",
            "The reason \u201cAfrican-American\u201d became as alternative for \u201cblack-American\u201d was because it recognizes the culture and heritage of Americans who are the descendants of slaves in the United States who most likely cannot determine specific roots from African nations. \n\nWhen slaves were brought over, they were stripped of the identity, cultural and familial. Slaves from various countries were just thrown together. Over the generations these grandchildren and beyond of Africans were engrained in America with a distinct culture.\n\nAnother American concept that is an off-shoot of the institution of slavery is the notion that if a person [has any African blood from their parents, grandparents, great grandparents, or great-great grandparents, they were considered black](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadroon). It was originally important in determining who could be a slave, but later it was important for segregation. The infamous Supreme Court case [Plessy v. Ferguson](https://www.britannica.com/event/Plessy-v-Ferguson-1896) which legalized segregation in America involved a man who was one-eighth black (one black great grandparent) and seven-eighths white but was considered legally black. \n\nSo \u201cBlack-American\u201d could have skin color that could be actually a black pigment or light enough they could be thought to be white. So another factor is that calling someone by a color that might not actually reflect their appearance may have a diminishing impact. \n\nSo African-American was intended to be a prideful title that specifically reflects that American history of descendants of slaves and a way not to just use a skin color to determine that.\n\nWhy isn\u2019t \u201cEuropean-American\u201d used?\n\nUsually it\u2019s because people who reflect their European heritage can just specify their country of family origin. People might be Italian, or Germany, or Russian or Irish, etcera. People could be \u201cAnglo\u201d too but since the USA was an off-shoot of England (Great Britain) I guess it\u2019s kind of redundant.\n\nPeople from Jamaica are Jamaican. And when you call someone \u201cJamaican\u201d it reflects a nationality and a culture. \u201cAfrican-American\u201d is similar in that it factors a heritage but signifies that a person is a USA native who is black with an ancestor who was a slave in the States.\n\nWhen a person from an African nation immigrates to the US and settles, they aren\u2019t an *African-American* by that definition, they would be hyphenated based on their nation of origin. For example, Nigerian-American. Both the Nigerian-Americans and the African-Americans are black, but their culture and roots could be completely different. \n\nEdit: Thanks for the gold!",
            "I would be willing to bet Blacks in Europe know their country of origin.\n\nI'm a Black American. I'm fine with Black, African-American, Negro (esp if your mother-tongue is a Latin-based language), or even Colored if I know you are over the age of 60.\n\nThe Blacks who are descendants of the slave trade have no clue where their family tree leads to prior to the 1920s in many cases and if family documents were decent because someone knew how to read/write, the 1850s. \n\nI went to school with a family from Belgium who was Black, but their grandparents were from Uganda. They considered themselves Belgian, but with family roots in Uganda. If you ask your average African-American where they are from they will say what City and and neighborhood.\n\nAlso, Whites are called European- Americans in some cases but often its designated at the country of origin. Also, I've seen Europe broken down by Anglo, Scandinavian, Slavic, Western, Eastern, and South and in few cases Central European.  Mind you I majored in Poli Sci and Econ, so the way people are broken down may be more targeted than everyday language.\n\nWithout being too blunt its directly related to for many Blacks in the USA our country of origin and ethnic identity is completely unknown. I went to predominately White elementary, MS and HS.  We did a genealogy project in 5th grade, even kids who's families were had came over on the Mayflower knew where the \"home\" country is.  My family history started at 1850ish on a plantation because my oldest relatively thats all they knew, they said their Dad's parents were born into slavery and they know they were passed around a bunch of islands and spent sometime in Florida, but earliest \"person\" in our family was born in the 1850s sometime on a Plantation in the American South. Because my elementary school had maybe 9 Black people in the school (K-5, with 2-3 classes of 30 kids per class) teachers typically offered Black students the chance to do a history project because they knew family records were so stuff to come by for many people.  My parents refused and made me try to find out information. My one side of the family records were non-existent past my great-grandma and she was semi-crazy, and the other side the records were actually pretty good because several family members had been to college, served in the military, lawyers, or owned property/businesses even as Blacks going back to the early 20th or late 19th century.",

            "I don't like using the term \"African American\" for a couple reasons. \n\nOne, it's safe to say that most black people in America were born in America, and that makes them Americans.\n\nTwo, if used to describe just their heritage, there are lots of peoples around the world with dark complexions, and to assume that everyone dark is African seems really weird to me. ",
            "As a white Anglo Saxon American, you can call me whatever the hell you wish. Just don't call me late for dinner.",
            "I'm not black so I'm not in a position to tell them what they should call themselves but I've always found that very peculiar, especially since most black people's ancestors have been in the US longer than most white people's ancestors.",
            "I've seen a lot of references to African-Americans being black, but what are we supposed to call Elon Musk who is an African living America?  Caucasian African American? or is also just African American?",
            "Because they're able to use more specific labels, like British, Polish, Italian, etc.\n\nBlack people have to call themselves \"African\", because all details about their ancestry are unavailable",
            "There are plenty of good answers here. One I don't think has been mentioned is one that takes a historian's point of view. The term \"white\" has *a* more rich and racist history than the phrase \"African Americans\".\n\nThe reason \"European-Americans\" would not catch on, and hasn't, is because the people who were originally considered to be members of the \"white\" race were very exclusive. To the point, court cases and various other legal diatribes had to be fought and won for certain groups to qualify and officially become part of the label. Clearly, they met much resistance. Who were these groups that had to be legally deemed \"white\"? Europeans; Italians, Irish, etc. Groups that faced persecution when they originally migrated by the original \"whites\". This is why \"European-American,\" does not stick, because, for a significant portion of time, there were those from Europe who were not considered \"white\" and were lambasted as such.",
            "I know a lot of black people from the Caribbean feel like being called African-American is stupid because they're Caribbean, not African. ",
            "I think we need to put a stop to all of the hyphens, it\u2019s not worth it.

Doesn\u2019t matter where your parents or ancestors came from. If you are European, you were born in Europe. Supposed to be based on birth not the color of your skin. I hope we can get to a point where human or earthling will be the major way we define ourselves instead of by the color of our skin.",
            "The more important question for me is: why aren't black people living in Europe called African-Europeans?",
            "Basically, because being of European descent has been seen for the past two centuries as the \"default\" condition for Americans. If not otherwise modified or identified, \"Americans\" are assumed to be white and of European ancestry.\n\nYes, it sounds biased by 21st-century sensitivities, but that's the answer, like it or not.",

            "I call them European Americans. Whites shouldn\u2019t be considered the default American. ",

            "Few things going on here.\n\nLet's start with with *why* black American culture is a thing but white American culture isn't.\n\nImmigrants came to America in waves. Looking at voluntary immigrants, different cultures came in and established distinctive neighborhoods. Little Italy, Chinatown, the Polish district, the French Quarter, so on and so forth. Most American cities have neighborhoods that trace their lineage back to specific cultures, with Irish, Scandinavian, German, French, Chinese, and Italian being the most common cultures repesented in these neighborhoods. Immigrants would move to these neighborhoods en masse, and then establish local traditions similar to the ones they left behind, slowly, over a few generations, acclimating to a larger \"American\" melting pot.\n\nI'm sure you can see, from my first paragraph, where I'm going next. Involuntary immigrants. Slaves, in other words. From the earliest, pre-Revolution American slaves, the locals worked hard to eradicate the slaves' culture. They were forcefully converted to Christianity, forced to speak exclusively the language of their owners, and forbidden from keepign the traditions of their cultures. Their cooking evolved into soul food, their music into spirituals. Their faith with Christianity, bringing some of their rituals forward, and even led to the creation of the Vodoun (VooDoo) faith.\n\nSo, why does this create such a difference? Well, where white Americans kept the knowledge of their cultural roots; Greek versus Dutch, the black Americans were forced to bleed their culture into one big mass. There's no Gold Coast versus Congolese neighborhoods; just the ghettos they were forced to live in. Black American culture is a distinct poverty culture that developed parallel to the dominant American culture, mostly white. American culture in the mainstream is the result of the culture that was developed by white Americans, which blacks have only been given permission to participate in fairly recently.\n\nSo, why African-American? That's just the name of the moment, an attempt to outrun the negative connotations of the names for a people chained into poverty for centuries. There are Kenyan-Americans, but there are many people for whom their ancestral culture is just African-American.\n\nThis is also why White Pride and Black Pride aren't really equivalent terms in the US. One is expressing pride in exclusion, the other in the culture developed as a response to being excluded. Black American Pride is more kin to Irish-American Pride or French-American Pride than to White American Pride.",

            "White people never really needed an alternative phrase. Caucasian pops up time to time but it hasn't been *needed*. The black population, however, was an uncertain story. After a long period of referring to them as various slurs, like negroes, which was greatly tied to racial connotations, we needed something better. Similarly, \"black people\" or \"blacks\" has some of the same usage as \"negroes\" or \"niggers\". While All four phrases were not always intended to be racist and often, in context, was accepted as not offensive, we also knew it was a time to refrain from using phrases that primarily dehumanized them (though they often weren't, they were most often were). \n\n\nFor five minutes in my life time, people had a problem with calling them black people, but that has calmed down for the past while. People still have a problem with using \"blacks\" *sometimes*, but that greatly depends on where you're currently and context. I myself use it as much as \"whites\" to cut the syllables, but that's also better accepted where I've been most my life. ",

            "A little late to the party but....  In addition to, and perhaps more significant than, describing color, the term African-American also refers to an individuals ancestry.  If you ask me where I \"came from\" I can easily point to my fathers maternal great grandparents immigration from Wales and his name Hansen is obviously  Danish.  My mothers grandparents were both the first generation of their family born here and were 100% German.  So I am not \"European American\", I am mostly German, as well as Danish and Welsh.  In addition to oral family history there are birth and immigration records I can use to trace to find my roots.\n\nIf you ask my brother in law where he comes from it's a completely different amswer.  His mother grew up in Mississippi.  She was told growing up that her great grandfather was called \"Nigger Jim\" and was the first member of her family to be born a free man in the early 1870's.  He worked for a blacksmith for many years near Biloxi Mississippi.  He is unable to trace his lineage back any further as in addition to being the first born free Jim was also the first to have a last name/surname/family name.  Jim didn't know where his parents were from because they were separated at auction from their parents when they were very young.  Nigger Jim's parents didnt know where their parents were from, only that they were brough over on separate slave ships sometime in the 1830's.  My brother in law's fathers story is similar.  There are no birth or public records he can use to try and trace his lineage because those records weren't kept for slaves.  Slavers and slave owners often tried to separate families as it was thought that slaves would be more docile and less likely to cause problems surrounded by strangers as opposed to family memebers or other members of their tribes.\n\nMy brother in law can't tell you where he comes from because his acenstry was stolen and destroyed by the institution of slavery.  He uses the term African-American to describe that.",

Which is less accurate of a description for any individual than simply using \"black, and really annoys the shit out of people of dark skin, who do not think the term African-American describes them less accurately. It also completely eliminates a real fact of American history: that not all people of dark sin came via the slave ships of Africa. Some were from Europe and some actually owned slaves themselves.\n\nYou point about European-Americans is one that comes up, but not just for whites. I know many people with black skin, who are of European or Caribbean descent, who really do not appreciate being called African-American, or having that as the only description for them in an official form or survey. They may be originally descending from Africa, but if this is about identity and respect of culture, then the term is abhorrent. It ignores the amount of immigration of dark-skinned people from other countries since then.\n\nIs a twist of irony, the term is actually quite racist and disrespectful of culture itself. Personally, I think it's continued use demonstrates why the country is having such a hard time getting over the race issue.

            "There are two reasons.\n\nMost white Europeans can trace their ancestry to a specific \"mother country\".  I have a friend whoses parents were both born in Germany and came to this country as children.

Family lore is also a big clue.\n\nBut the descendants of African slaves don't have these clues.  We just know that our ancestors came from Africa.  \n\nAnother reason why \"African American\" is useful: African American is not the same thing as black.  While most black Americans are the descendants of African slaves brought to the US, not all black Americans have this history.  Some are African immigrants.  Some are from South America or the Caribbean.  We could speak of the Harlem Renaissance as a \"black American cultural movement.\"  But \"African American\" is more precise because \"African American\" is typically used to refer to a specific ethnic group (black people rooted to America multigenerationally via slavery), rather than a racial group (anyone with dark skin of African origin).  My Ghanaian coworker and I are both \"black Americans\".  But we do not share the same ethnicity, since he is Ashanti and I am African American.  His son, who was born in the US, likely identifies as Ghanaian American more than \"African American\".  \n\nFor what it's worth, almost all the black people I know have absolutely no problem being called \"black\".

So I\u2019m saying there\u2019s a chance.\n\nThe reason why so many Christians evangelize (or at least in theory why Catholics did historically) is because technically it\u2019s actually **a lot easier to be saved** as a Christian because God bestows His Grace in Sacraments. Those Sacraments turn around and make the adherent more devout (in theory).\n\nYou could complete the first *Super Mario* level without help but it\u2019s insanely hard your first time with just running and not jumping. And a lot easier to do when you have the Fire Flower, Star, and Mushroom.\n\nSo the Christians who evangelize (which Christ literally told them to do) are implicitly saying \u201cDo you want to walk to Heaven, or would you like the car with the imperfect GPS to drive there?\u201d\n\nIf you were lost, what would you want to use?\n\n=======\n\nSo I can divert this into natural law, on what the Church means, etc. But to those lucky few reading this, as a thank you for doing so\u2026\n\n**MY FAVORITE CATHOLIC FACT.**\n\nBack in 1917, Pope Benedict codified a code of Canon Law because there wasn\u2019t anything else going on at the time. Just kidding, it started under the previous pope, but he put it into effect during World War I.\n\nOne of the canons (or laws of the Church) concerned how to deal with Church management in the Colonial Era. So how can you manage a church in Antarctica without priests there already? The canon said that the *bishop of the first explorer there takes care of that land* until the Church there gets up and running.\n\nSo some technical law. Why is that fun? The entire canon law changed in 1983, so why are you mentioning this ?\n\nBecause \ud83c\udfb6 we went to the Moon in 1969, not 1968 but a year later. \ud83c\udfb6 \n\nSince NASA\u2019s Cape Canaveral is where Apollo 11 left from, the minute Neil Armstrong stepped on the Moon, the Archdiocese of Orlando (where Cape Canaveral is diocesewise) became responsible for the Moon until there is enough people on the Moon to have a flourishing church.\n\nSo the bishop of Orlando is technically also Bishop of the Moon.",

God is defined by Christianity as whatever the largest concept of infinity could possibly be, this means he is infinite love and wisdom. Many Christian\u2019s believe that because of this, there are no people in hell, but others believe that hell is the choice to not share in love. Jesus says, \u201cwhat you have done to the least of me you have done to me\u201d and also \u201cFor to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who does not have, even what he has will be taken away.\u201d Both relate to love.

            "I was raised Calvinist (Presbyterian church in America). I am now an atheist, but I\u2019ll explain this how it was explained to me. \n\nI was taught predestination, which basically means that, before god made everything, he chose specific people to be saved. He knew every person that would ever live, and picked his favorites to go to heaven. Everyone else will go to hell. \n\nIf you are one of the \u201celect\u201d (favorites), then, at some point in your life, you will find god and become a Christian. It is not possible to refuse god\u2019s grace, so if you\u2019re part of the elect, you\u2019ll be a christian no matter what. However, if you\u2019re not part of the elect, you can never become a Christian. \n\nTherefore, people will go to hell whether or not they hear the word. We\u2019re still supposed to go out into the world and spread the gospel because Jesus commands it, plus we don\u2019t know who is elect and who isn\u2019t, so we should try to reach everyone in case they\u2019re part of the elect. We might be the vessel god uses to reach those people. \n\nIf someone is part of the elect, but no one tells them about Christianity, somehow they\u2019ll still become a Christian. God will reveal himself to them through nature, emotions, dreams, etc. You cannot go to heaven without putting your faith in god, because good works don\u2019t earn you shit. \n\nSince this is what some Christians believe, I don\u2019t know why they bother sending out missionaries. It probably has something to do with control, saviorism, and colonization, but idk. \n\nBut there are over 10,000 denominations inside Christianity and each one believes different things. This is what I was taught, but others have had completely different experiences. I know some people who believe that everyone goes to hell unless they hear the word and accept christ, so missionaries are extremely important.",

If you were never warned by a prophet, then yount be tortured.\n\nSecond part is that it is the holy duty of Muslims to spread words God through Jihad and Dawaa.\n\nSo if you are Muslim, it is not really your decision to leave people ignorant on purpose to avoid sending them to hell.",

Only when we choose to do wrong after learning about it, and choosing to separate yourself from enlightenment in Heaven, will you dig yourself into Hell. \n\nYou do not get sent to Hell, God doesn\u2019t send you there on his judgment.

            "Hmm in my experience they don't greet you, they just harass you while you try to leave so they can look over every item on your receipt...\n\nWhat's most annoying is, there will only be one or two check out lines a million miles long, but ever entrance will have a \"greeter\".",
            "It\u2019s called \u201ccheaper than a loss prevention department \u201c",
            "Yup, Wal-Mart.",
            "All of the really, really big stores do it. Wal-Mart, Target, Meijers, etc. Simply having a person say \"hello\" when you walked in and \"goodbye\" when you left was found to significantly reduce shoplifting. \n\nThe nicer, non-walmart ones might give you to a basket or cart, ask if you'd like the store flier, direct you to customer service if you've walked in with a return, etc. During Covid, they'd be checking masks and sanitizing carts or baskets as well. \n\nBut the Wal-Mart ones just kind of sit on a stool like gargoyles and vaguely grunt in greeting as you pass them. It's a pretty common job for the elderly and those with disabilities, since you sit and say hello and that's about all.\n\nUnless you set off an alarm, they don't check receipts as you leave. They just give you the goodbye nod.\n\nI have heard that the type of Wal-Mart greeter is a good indication of the crime level in an area. If there's a normal greeter, it's low crime. If a \"security\" person is acting as a greeter, it's middle to high. And if they have an actual cop as a greeter, it's very high (though I've never seen one myself)\n\n2 other types of stores besides the Wal-Mart clone ones might have greeters: \n\nMembership stores, such as Sam's Club or Costco, will have greeters who check your membership upon  entering, and your receipt upon exit.\n\nStores which want to seem fancy or like they have high customer service. They'll be the more helpful type, asking if they can help you find what they're looking for and etc. Those places will have attractive, young people as greeters, not the disabled or elderly. They may be less obvious than Wal-Mart greeters, being told to hover near the entrance doing useless tasks like folding or arranging, or they may be very obvious, like a receptionist, depends on the store.",
            "Yep, Walmart Greeter is a thing.  When my girls were little, the Greeter lady would give them each a big yellow smiley face sticker.",
            "In Canada we have retired people or people with disabilities that do this because they're bored usually (for the retired segment), or just to make a bit of supplemental income. It's not something that anyone who isn't retired or has a disability that impedes them from other work would generally apply for.",
            "Yes. This is at most retail stores, there is mostly always someone to greet you/ask if you need assistance at the door. I am a former retail worker. Happens lots of places, not just Wal-Mart. Sometimes you are hired as a greeter, other times you are randomly assigned the position for a portion of the day. I would say usually the greeters have other duties around the store, but greeter is usually a break of sorts.",
            "Yes they do, and they also have people putting your items in a bag for you. I have never seen it in any other country, so I was very suprised when I saw that in the US.",

            "I worked in a warehouse. Men\u2019s warehouse. I was a greeter. I'd like to see Darryl greet people. He'd probably make them feel like wimps. Not me, I... \"Hello, I'm Michael. Welcome to Men's Wearhouse. We have a special on khaki pants today.\" This is one example.",
            "Well there job is to check your recipe if you have a lot of items aswell to make sure you\u2019re not stealing but yeah it\u2019s mostly just greeting. Only a Walmart thing btw",
            "No, the correct answer is no. My wife does this job is not elderly or disabled and makes good money. Her job is AP (assest protection) their job is to deter people from shop lifting and only check receipts for unbagged items.",
            "Walmart used to have old people as greeters, but with COVID they've replaced them with younger people handing out masks.",
            "Yes. Walmart has been having people do it for 20 years. Its to let people know they are being watched so don't steal from the store, dude.\n\nIts all a Loss Prevention technique.",
            "Yes kinda, but it's not as ridiculous as it's made out to be. Firstly it's really only Walmarts, and secondly they do more than just say \"welcome to walmart, I love you\", a lot of the times they'll check receipts, keep track of carts/baskets, or help direct customers to certain sections of the store. Its all still pretty mundane, but it's meant to be a low-level entry/extra money for the elderly type of position.",
            "It's currently my job at Target, I'm great at it and actually try to be engaging. It's boring sometimes yes, but you also get to clean carts and organize the area, as long as you're mostly in the front, I remember most faces that I see and even say bye to them when I clock out, the regulars say bye back, I've also received TONS of complements.",
            "My mom is a proud greeter at Home Depot.  Also directs people to the aisle of what they are looking for.",
            "They do, typically it\u2019s a disabled person or an elderly person who wouldn\u2019t be able to work otherwise. There\u2019s exceptions sure, but it\u2019s a nice gesture employing people who couldn\u2019t get a job doing something else."

If you replace \u201clobster\u201d with \u201cliving creature\u201d it reads something like this: \n\nIt\u2019s customary for us to go to a holding cell, choose 4 captive living creatures, whose claws are bound, home with us, where we boil and eat 3 of them while a 4th one is chosen at random to watch. Then, once we\u2019ve dismembered and feasted on the boiled ones\u2014mind you, with the remaining living creature being forced to witness this, too\u2014we drive it to the middle of what we vaguely think might be its habitat, where we let it loose to maybe find other living creatures and recount to them tales of how we merrily killed and ate its friends. \n\nI actually think whether or not the spared living creature has the capacity to understand what\u2019s happening is kinda moot. The fact that anyone would participate in the above ritual concerns me deeply. Fuck. I don\u2019t know how to process that. \n\nI vote family of sociopaths.

That\u2019s just evil.\n\nAnd, let me tell you, as someone who lives at the beach, sea creatures will seek you out when you\u2019re kind. I\u2019ve had fiddler rays follow me and let me stroke them, and they nuzzle my feet and come back for more. I\u2019ve had fish swim between my legs and nibble me. Fish have feelings and emotions.\n\nAt this point in history, we don\u2019t quite know how similar sea creatures are to humans. But, assume it\u2019s at the highest possible standard that they understand us. \n\nSo yes, using that standard, your family sucks.",

            "Seems like it would've been a funny joke once, but if this is a actual tradition when cooking lobster it just seems super unhinged and pointless. A lobster doesnt care that you are eating other lobsters and it probably ends up dead from the environmental shock and probably weakening of spending that much time out of water. Ignoring that live lobsters arent cheap and it would be utterly wasteful to do such a thing, I suspect you're either joking or you've fallen for a joke and dont realize it.",
            "My family grew up in New England and came down from Canada, where will still have a summer home and a lobster pot. I have eaten thousands, and I mean thousands of lobsters. Honestly, I am in my early 30s and can *count on my hands* the days I have not had lobster in the months of July and August. If we didn't catch them, my sister and I were sent down to the fish market to buy them. I don't say this in any sort of braggadocios way.
