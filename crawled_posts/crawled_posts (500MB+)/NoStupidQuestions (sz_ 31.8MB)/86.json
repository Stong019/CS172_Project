Sounds that start with the heavy \"ch\" followed by an \"i\" sound never have an ending \"ng\", but they can have an \"n\" ending. Whereas \"chong\" words do exist, but the \"o\" vowel is pronounced more like the \"o\" in \"choke\" than the \"o\" in \"chong\".\n\nWe can compromise, and try using the lighter \"ch\", where in some places, people speaking casually do say it like a heavy \"ch\". In this case there are some phrases in Chinese that can sound like \"ching chong\". But Chinese is a tonal language, and tone is very important. Saying \"ching chong\" in an English accent won't really work.\n\nPossible han yu pin yin combinations: qing chong, qing cong.\n\nHowever if we are allowed to use an \"n\" ending for \"ching\" instead of ng, we can save the hard \"ch\" sounds.\n\nPossoble hanyu pin yin combinations: qun chong.",

            "A huge portion of food pairing comes from texture or complementary flavors. Sweet and savory, crispy and smooth, etc. Crispy fries contrast with the smooth creamy ketchup, just like salt contrasts with chocolate or caramel. It introduces layers of flavor, and when done correctly, enhances the other taste. This also works on the opposite end of the spectrum - too many similar flavors added to one dish can cause an overload and make the dish taste terrible. For example garlic is savory and salty in its own flavor profile, so if you add a hefty portion of garlic to a dish that already calls for salt to add it's savory component, you're likely to make the dish taste TOO savory and ruin it. Garlic can replace salt and vice-versa in most recipes. Sugar can be used to sweeten a dish in place of another sweet component, like when you make tomato sauce some people will add sugar instead of letting the tomato cook down all day long to release more sugars, making the sauce less acidic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the case of your fries/ketchup example, it's a matter of texture. If you've never tried mashed potatoes with ketchup or whatever other sweet condiment you may pair with your main course (like the gravy from a pot roast or the browned drippings of a meatloaf) you're missing out. It TASTES just as good as a crispy french fry with ketchup, the only difference is the texture.",

There's some variables that can make it more or less likely to happen, and that'll be different depending on the person. Swimming in a basic forward motion in a pool is unlikely to cause this to happen (though a small amount would be common enough). Jumping crotch first into the water might.

            "OP: The question you should be asking is whether that vagina is comfortable if water goes inside.\n\nHere are the facts: \n\nSwimming or having a bath doesn't fill a vagina with a lot of water, but it can be problematic for a vagina anyway.\n\nBe aware that water with chlorine from the pool/hot tub or bubbles in the bathtub *can* irritate the vagina and initiate a yeast infection. Also a woman wearing wet swimsuit bottoms for an afternoon can cause this problem.\n\nTo add, having sex in a shower, hot tub, spa or pool increases a woman's risk of having inflammation in her vagina that can lead to pain or a yeast infection. The water plus friction during sex will remove the lubrication that her body naturally has otherwise.\n\nHaving penetrative sex in water can lead to discomfort for her that lasts a week or two after that moment. Her pain and discomfort will prevent sex until she feels better.\n\nGet out of the water and find a better place to get it on.  \n\nSorry for the long answer but yes, water can enter a vagina but not fill it completely.",

            "Ok, so imagine that the vagina is a tube. Like, the neck of an unfilled, untied balloon maybe.\n\nThe way it's usually positioned, it's kind of tipped up on itself. Like, if you tilted the balloon neck at an angle, so opening ring is pressed flat against the inside wall of the neck of the balloon. So you can touch the inside wall without reaching inside.\n\nIf you put that underwater, it's not going to fill up with water. It's basically sealed shut.\n\nAlso, unlike a balloon, the vagina is a really strong muscle, like a fist. It's not as definitive as a sphincter. But it's going to want to stay closed most of the time.",

            "I'm too late to answer this, but your question has a pretty neat neurological answer. There are two separate well knows parts of the brain each responsible for different language skills. Wernicke's area in the brain is responsible for language perception/understanding, while broca's area is responsible for language production/motor. A person can actually lose the ability to use one or the other because of physical trauma to the area while not losing the other and develop either wernicke's aphasia or broca's aphasia. Additionally, children can grow up to have developmental problems in one area but not the other, and when a child has a hard time talking in early age they will test to see if it's a comprehension problem or a language production problem (or mutism or hearing problems or intellectual problems, etc, but never mind that). \nAlso, it's shown that people's first and second languages often physically utilize different parts of the brain. \n\nIn general, to get better at speaking a language, one must use it. Anxiety or just lack of people  to speak a language to can deter a person from practicing, presumably underdeveloping their Broca area for their secondary language. Usually being immersed in that language and forcing yourself to speak it will help you learn it fairly quickly.  As a personal example, my parents speak Russian and I understood it fully but had difficulty speaking it in childhood until I forced myself to only speak to them in Russian later on in life and now it's much easier nowadays (although my accent and grammar are probably never going to be perfect).",

            "I have three native languages, Italian (from my dad), French (from my mom and siblings) and English (from the places I've lived). I used to be able to speak Italian as a young child but seeing as I only had one person to talk to in that language, I quickly lost it. I still understand it, and when I visit my parents, dad will often be watching RAI or something and unless it's a show in Neapolitan or Sicilian or something I can still follow along.\n\nI can tell you it's far easier to look up in your brain a word you've heard before than to look for the Italian equivalent of whatever it is you want to say.

            "Well, let's take a basic sentence (or series thereof I suppose) in English. Also, don't worry, you don't need to read every single point entirely and can skip to the summary at the bottom if you want.\n\n\"Oh hey, I just found it! I've been looking for that forever!\"\n\nYou have to know  \nA) Interjections (might not be the correct term, I'm a bit rusty on my terminology atm). \"oh\" and \"hey\" are just a specific way of denoting surprise, so it's pretty simple, and I think even a fairly new student to English could figure this out because they probably have a direct analogy in their own language.\n\nB) Pronouns. They could have used \"I\", sure, but also \"me\" \"mine\" \"we\" or \"our\". Depending on their native tongue it's possible any of those would make more sense to them to use in that sentence, because they could very well have a specific phrase that means \"I found it\" but uses, say, the first person plural, like \"we\".  \nC) Qualifying statements. Just isn't a super specific word, but in this case it refers to a specific time, but if a language student only learned it in the minimizing sense like you would use in an argument (\"I was just saying...\"), it might not be obvious that they can use it to indicate that something happened recently.   \nD) Found as a verb is pretty simple, but bear in mind not all language are inflected, so they might only have \"find\" and use other words to indicate past tense, or not use past tense at all! This means they have to choose from \"found\" \"find\" \"will find\" (<--- Native language dependent), so they might have to spend a bit thinking on it, but I also think this one would be taught fairly early to a student, so I'll give this one to them.\n\nE) Contractions. If they said \"I have been looking for this\" it sounds a little bit weird to us. It might seem simple, and like there's not that many of them, but to a non-native speaker it's not immediately obvious where to and not to use contractions, and if one even exists for that word combination they just used.\n\nF) Present perfect tense (might not be the right term, sorry). \"I have been\" indicates that the person was actively searching for something for an extended period of time, including up until very recently in the past or even the present, as of that sentence. This is not present in every language, and in one with just a past tense, for example, they might say \"I looked for that\" for example, which kind of means \"I looked for it at one point but then stopped for some reason\", which is a different meaning entirely, and to someone not used to English this could be a very confusing sentence.\n\nG) I think most languages will have an equivalent or analogue to \"that\", but not all languages use the same type of word. For example, in Swedish, I don't understand why they will say \"det \u00e4r det bra\", or something to that effect, where they will use a word that suspiciously looks like \"that\" twice for no sane reason I can conclude. On the other hand, some languages will use a phrase, like \"it is\" and it basically means \"that is to say\" or they'll use just \"it\" for everything, so someone would specifically have to study how to say \"that\" in place of just repeating the name of the object in question.\n\nH) Forever is an exaggeration, obviously, but I think most people would understand that the speaker is not implying they are an immortal primordial god, but it's still something they might not think to say on their own without extensive study.\n\nI) Word order. Coming from another language, these words could go in any order. They have to specifically study probably about 5-10 hours minimum to understand the placement of each of these types of words in all of these previous entries. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo anyway, that's a lot of stuff even from two very simple sentences. Each of these would take many many hours of dedicated practice to understand, but many times that to learn to say because there's probably two or three different possibilities at least for each word in this sentence, meaning it probably takes three to four times the time to learn to use these properly in a sentence, and take out almost any of them and the sentence will either lose meaning or sound unnatural. \n\nAlso, there's context clues for understanding a sentence, too. If somebody heard \"found it\" and a bunch of other stuff they didn't understand but the person looks happy, the listener can figure out that they're qualifying that statement with a bunch of adornments, and still get most of the meaning of the sentence. If you speak the sentence you have to fully understand every single part of your statement. This makes the gap between speaking and understanding even longer.",

She's fairly out of practice since moving from California to New York State. About 5 or 6 years ago. But she'd definitely be better at it than my dad if she tried speaking it lmao. \n\nBasically for both of them, it's due to a lack of trying or practicing regularly.

            "I think you can first try to understand that it's not entirely true that people who are \"**able to understand a language, but aren\u2019t able to speak it\"** can definitely speak some select words, but cannot form a definite sentence with proper sentence construction. In most languages (I cannot speak for all, as I am not a professional in world linguistics, but insofar as among the languages I do speak this is the case:) there is a sentence construction much like in English with the Noun-Linking Verb-predicate relationship. People who cannot speak but understand a language does not have the proficiency to understand the intricacies and nuances of a language's sentence construction. In learning a new language, one often learns words first before moving on to proper sentences. Perhaps these people who are able to understand, but not speak a language are simply in the transition between learning new words and learning a sentence form (or perhaps they simply do not have the time or patience to learn beyond simple words as it is often good enough to convey simple ideas \\[Consider a non-English speaker making a purchase in a grocery. It is much easier for him to approach the counter and simply utter \"Water\" rather than \"I would like to buy water\". The sentence \"I would like to buy water\" may seem trivial to a native speaker, but it may be difficult for a non-English speaker to differentiate the use of \"would\" versus \"will\" or \"like\" versus \"love\". In the latter case it is technically correct, but colloquially it is not commonly used in that manner. This is another consideration that a non-English speaker has to think about. With all this in mind it is simply much easier for one who is not versed with a language to simply used basic words rather than full sentences which perhaps leads them to refrain from using the language altogether.\\])\n\nFurthermore, it's more of simply knowing some key words in a sentence that brings about a speculated idea rather than a truly cohesive idea. For example if I were to say \"Horse house\" the proper noun for this would be a horse stable, but since you understand that I am pertaining to the living area of the animal horse then you can approximate the idea I'm trying to convey.\n\nIt goes beyond this also, for languages such as Chinese where some characters change meanings entirely based on what characters that proceed or precede them some ideas can be taken from context clues in that sense. Take the word  \u529e\u516c\u5ba4. Imagine if you did not know the first character in the word. I inform you that the second character means work, and the last character means area/room or space. You could possibly surmise that this word probably means a \"work-place\" or simply the office.\n\nThis is my personal anecdote on how I learned to speak a language from a person who simply understands, so perhaps this is not the case for everyone.",

However, I find making my own sentence up easier because as long as I know the words I need, you basically just fit them in the correct slots to form a reasonable sentence.

I don't speak a word of Chinese at all, but yet, I've been able to have a 'conversation' with a Lady who didn't speak a word of English and got her the items she needed.

There are ad providers that do, but those providers also have other rules, like where/when you can place ads, what content can be in the ads and what layout they can have (ever noticed the really shitty ones with a big X in the corner? Places right under, but a bit higher, then the X to close the ad? If you hit that bigger X, it counts as a click to the ad)\n\nThe issue is that these ads don't go with those ad providers, they go for the other ones, the ones also based in countries that make it hard to stop their blatant copyright infringement. They don't care, they pay out to anyone who requests ads and they take money from anyone who offers it.

At some point, you become a parental figure in their life.\n\nEdit: For a little more context, this has happened to me a few times. If you have kids, put that in your dating profile! I was talking to someone and found out through IG that they have kids. They went off on me and said I was selfish and wrong. I have dated with men with kids, even ones who promise there is no drama, there always is. I think it's a huge responsibility to date someone with kids and if it ends up serious, it's a responsibility I don't want!\n\nEdit2: I am a woman. I think people just assume a woman wants kids and I'm selfish for not. So some men with kids think it's selfish of me or there is something wrong with me because I'm supposed to want and be around kids.\n\n\nEdit3: I asked because it has happened multiple times!

I've met parents who say, \"I'm not looking for a stepparent for my kid\", or \"he has a mum\", etc. Fact is, if a parent gets into a serious relationship, the partner is going to become a parental *figure*.

So indirectly, I pay for his former family) and I also didn't want to plan our life together with some space for other children. It's just a hassle since I'm no fan of children anyway.\n\nSo on the contrary. If I don't want to engage with children, it's only fair if I don't date somebody with strings attached. It's fair for the person and the children plus for my mental health. I mean, what's the alternative? Being a shitty person trying to ignore the children or push them out? Nah.",

If you are rather alone and wait for a better fit, that's more than your right.\n\nThis goes on to those who have unrealistic goals too. If a 5 will only date a 9+, that's their right. The person is only wrong if they start arguing that everyone else is a problem that they are alone. As long as anyone is happy with their own situation, no one else should have a say on the topic.",

The only time I've ever seen someone date someone else who hated kids, she completely abandoned her kids for him, leaving them at her mother's and just never talking to them again. The relationship lasted about 3 years until he got her pregnant. She thought for sure he would change his mind now that it was his. He told her he wanted her to get an abortion because not only did he not want kids but she wasn't a very good mother since she abandoned her other 2 kids. I wish I could have been there to see her face. Anyways, she had the kid and he left her way before then. Completely moved to another state and she's not been able to find him for years. \n\nIt would take a very terrible parent to get with someone who doesn't want children.",

However, when I am ready to get back into it, I plan on being up front about it. Why wouldn't you? Go ahead and save everyone the trouble and be up front at the beginning.",

I find that as much as I may adore the child/children, I'm selfish now.  I want time and spontaneous moments with my partner,  not scheduled moments between responsibilities of parenting younger children that I cannot participate or have any say in the parenting.  Especially when things don't work out, then you've fallen in love with those kids AND your partner, and then they, along with your partner, are now absent from your life.\n\nIt's heartbreaking. \n\n\nI say these things as a 46 year old woman as well, with this exact experience under my belt.

Told the guy I wasn\u2019t interested in dating someone with kids because I literally just do not want them (and I was really young??) and he went OFF on me.\n\nKids are part of a lifestyle. It\u2019s not a small dealbreaker like, I dunno, not liking pizza or something. You are literally dating a person as well as potentially becoming a parent figure for their kid. Don\u2019t let anybody tell you that it\u2019s selfish for cutting out that part of your dating pool. You\u2019re allowed to not want to date people that conflict with what you want in life.",

People with kids in their 30s vs people without kids in their 30s is a huge difference in life, everything from priorities to time and to-some-extent maturity.

If you aren't ready for that, I wouldn't do it.\n\nIt will at minimum create incredible friction when he/she constantly needs small things from you like leaving work early to pick them up because they are sick from school or they cancel a date at the last minute because they have strep and you never wanted any of that.",

Everyone has preferences. Is it homophobic for a straight woman to no longer want to date or find attraction to a man who has sexually transitioned to a woman? Hell no it isn't! It is preferences. We have no issue with with having kids. Just remember that they are yours. Not everyone wants kids or wants to date people with them because not everyone can handle to burden of children. If you date someone with kids then you will definitely have to share that burden. It is selfish for single parents to expect everyone to be fine with it. They should put it on their dating profiles.\n\nI read a post yesterday about a person who walked out mid date after the woman disclosed she has a kid. Why? Because it wasn't for him. If he had known, then he wouldn't have continued chatting. They were talking for a couple of weeks before so she should have definitely told him then before arranging a date to save the embarrassment. She also purposefully kept that information secret because she knew it is a big deal breaker for most people. \nSingle parents, please do NOT withhold this kind of information. Some people will not agree to a date if they know this information. Some people will walk out on dates after having this information sprung on them. Do the right thing and be completely honest and transparent from the start. Don't call others selfish for not wanting to be around children or not wanting to help raise YOUR children.

Personally I am the same and that part bothers me because then 1 or more dates in when they feel comfortable with you then they might tell you about their kids and you're just left there feeling like you've been led on after a bombshell like that. \nI have no doubt some people can be step-fathers and mothers and love it but it's dumb to expect everyone to be onboard with that especially if they don't want kids. Nothing selfish about it, just honest.",
            "It\u2019s perfectly fine not to want to be a parent, but please don\u2019t expect people to put their kids in their dating profile.\n\nPeople already run the risk enough with creeps after trying to vet them- there\u2019s no need to increase the chances by announcing to millions of stranger that you have kids.",
            "HEY!  Single dad here... and there's nothing wrong with you not being interested in dating me due to my kids.  They receive the majority of my non-working time and I don't have enough spare time to provide the kind of active social life as a non-parent could.\n\nI'm not totally daft or self-centered to think that you need to change your expectations on my behalf.  If you want a big chunk of your partner's time, and have that time not involve kids running around, then you *shouldn't* be interested in dating someone who gives more of their time to their kids than to you...",
            "Sounds like the person who told you that was projecting their own insecurities on to you. Life pro tip: you don't need to care.",
            "Not wrong at all.  People need to stop being so damn hypocritical.",
            "Nope, kids will 10000% be apart of your life if you are with someone with kids. Unless that person has given custody to the other SO and refuses to apart of their life. Your totally fine not wanting kids. They aren't for Everyone",
            "No, it's completely OK. Better to not date them than to make them choose or not like the kids.",
            "Honestly, I think you know this better than 1000 random strangers on the internet. You know whether your reason is a good one, or whether deep down it is a selfish one; if you say it\u2019s a good reason, it\u2019s a good reason, and nobody else gets to judge.\n\nReading through your edits, I would just like to add one detail: \u201cIt is a truth universally acknowledged that a man in possession of a decent dating profile must behave like an asshole once he gets rejected.\u201d Seriously, especially on some of the dating apps, there are a lot of guys with very fragile egos.",
            "Thanks for asking this. I\u2019ve been told the same.",
            "I am a man and totally agree and understand you. I will never date a single mother.",
            "I'm the 1000 comment. Your welcome. \nAnswer in no",
            "Kids are higher priority. So you are secondary. Would u like to be secondary in a relationship, no way.",
            "No.  I had a similar conversation with a friend.  Dating someone with children means you will always be second (or third or fourth\u2026) in the heart of that person.  There\u2019s nothing wrong with that either.  However, especially if you\u2019re young, you can both be the same age, but the person with children will see and experience the world differently than you.  It\u2019s just natural.\n\nNow, if you don\u2019t mind or feel threatened by the children, it can be very rewarding; and there are many single parents who would really love to have an adult to share their lives with and show their children the love they deserve.  But there\u2019s nothing wrong with feeling the way you do.  Anyone who says otherwise is being a jerk.",
            "Sorry that people have tried to make you feel bad about this. It's not the right choice for you and that's all that matters. No is a complete sentence and you don't owe anyone an explanation.",
            "You're totally fine to not want kids, and in the same vein; it's absolutely fine not wanting to bear any responsibility for anyone else's kids. I have kids, and wouldn't want to date someone else with kids. Honestly I dont want to date at all, but still. We all have our own responsibilities, goals, dreams, etc.. And kids, your own or otherwise, can seriously impede reaching them.\n\nHaving kids is a *personal* choice.",
            "No, you're not selfish. I am a newly single 35 year old woman with a 15 and a half year old son and if someone didn't want to date me because I have a child that is their prerogative. It's not selfish, it's your personal preference. You should choose what direction your life goes in and if someone calls you selfish for that then honestly, fuck em! Who are they or anyone else to tell you who you should be open to dating or not.",
            "It\u2019s your life.  Yes would only advise don\u2019t be destructive or hurtful, but be as picky and selective as you want.",
            "The same way you wouldn't want to date me, it's ok to not to date anyone else based on your own criteria. Nothing wrong here",
            "Almost all young single people don't want to date someone with kids. Every time it comes up, guys talk about single moms like the worst possible option lol.\n\nSeems harsh to me, but I'm a married dad. I like a good milf.",
            "Nta. Is it ok to have preferences when choosing a partner? Yes.",
            "You can date whoever the fuck you want",
            "My dude. You can date whoever the fuck you want.\n\nIgnore all gatekeepers.",
            "No. \n\n/thread\n\nI'm a 27 year old father with a 4 year old son.",
            "Fuck all that other advice, here's the real shit:\n\nIt's OK to be \"wrong\" and \"selfish\" if that's really you.\n\nOwn it.",
            "Nope-- it's good policy.",
            "My own kids drive me fucking nuts. No way do I want to deal with someone else's on top of them. Definitely not wrong.",
            "HELL FUCKING NO!!",
            "There's a million and one reasons to not want to date someone, they can be small and petty, or huge and big commitments.\n\nIs it selfish? Perhaps.\n\nIs it wrong? Hell no, you're mature enough to know for that one reason, it will put a dampener on things.\n\nWhen it comes down to not wanting to date someone with kids, that's completely understandable because that's a (or at least it should be....) huge part of their life and will be for many years.\n\nTo expect someone to come along into a family in that way and refuse to become a fully functioning family unit is awful and a lot worse than just being a single parent, especially if you have no intentions of having kids anyway.\n\nJust be thankful you dodged a bullet because even if they didn't have kids, their inability to accept that is a red flag.\n\nBad enough when it's something petty like glasses or hair colour, but kids are a huge commitment to become a part of. Sure you aren't blood related, but if all goes well you will end up as a parent....sure, you won't be the final say in their lives, but you'll still become a part of their lives and to suggest otherwise is making a tricky situation into a messed up situation.",
            "It\u2019s perfectly acceptable, I broke up 3 relationships before I met my husband because they didn\u2019t take me seriously, thought I just wasn\u2019t ready or would come around at some point. I was very upfront, even on the first date, when you are getting to know each other, \u201cdo you have any kids?\u201d \u201cNo, I\u2019ve never wanted children.\u201d Point blank, if you want kids, have them, if you don\u2019t, don\u2019t.",
            "No its not wrong or selfish or anything at all. If you dont want kids then you have all the right to be with someone who doesn't have children.",
            "You can pick any reason you want to not date someone",
            "Kids are a real commitment, and it shouldnt be taken lightly as the non-parent. It\u2019s not wrong to not want to make that commitment.",
            "As a 33 year old guy, who really has no interest in having kids in the next 5 years, I get called immature. Like sorry for putting my desire to travel and see the world before I get arthritis above my apparent social obligation to procreate.\n\nPeople are weird, do your own thing and ignore the haters.",
            "Nope! You 100% should be comfortable with who you date! This was my hard stop. You be you!",
            "It's fine. That's a deal breaker for you. Will everyone agree? No, but that just means they're not the right person for you.\n\nI mean, I have a kid. I still totally get it.",
            "Nope.if you don't like kids you aren't doing anyone a favor dating single parents.",
            "I have a kid and wouldn't blame someone for not wanting to date me. Kids require attention and understanding. If you arent their parent you just won't have the ability to understand what they need like their parent does. It will feel like you are second fiddle because you are.",
            "How is it \"selfish\" to not want to date someone that has a lifestyle you couldn't get on board with ?",
            "Nah. U do u boo.",
            "You should carry no guilt about this whatsoever!  One time during a phone call with a future blind date guy who I hadn\u2019t met yet  I asked if he was a felon, he said yes, and I said I\u2019m sorry I just can\u2019t date you.  He got really pissed at me, and I said would you have rather me not tell you and you waste your time and probably money you would have spent on me during the date?  He said no, I asked then why are you upset with that and asked do you really want to go out with a girl who has an issue with dating felons? and I said I just gave you the respect that any man deserves, honesty. It\u2019s okay to be a felon, I just don\u2019t want to date a felon.   Wouldn\u2019t you want to date someone who doesn\u2019t have issues? He told me he saw my point, then hung up.  I\u2019m okay with being the asshole, you should be too.   You never know what life holds in the future.   I also wouldn\u2019t date guys with long hair or guys that would put their hair in a really short ponytails.",
            "no. I see these kinds of questions all the time on subs like this one.\n\n**it\u2019s perfectly okay to want or not want to date someone based on anything going on in your or their lives.** \n\nwe all need to do what\u2019s best for ourselves in the long run.",
            "You can date whoever the hell you want to date",
            "I think it shows a solid understanding that if you date someone who is a halfway decent parent, the kids are part of the package when things get serious. And if someone has kids but purposefully has no part in their life or is willing to cut them off for a romantic relationship, that should be a massive red flag anyway.",
            "You are not forced into dating anyone you don't want to. Anyone who says otherwise can fuck right off.",
            "Fuck, I don't want to have my own kids, let alone raise someone else's.",
            "I dated a few  woman in the past with kids, it was never a no no but sometimes it comes with some baggage, often there's an ex & some left over fighting or bitterness about money or child sharing arrangements...sometimes it felt like I was stuck in the end a couples relationship & I just wanted something simpler, I ended up marrying someone with no kids, & we were not being able to have any....you just don't know what life throws up.\n\nI actually found the kids a lot of fun, I got on with them better than some of the mothers, one in  particular is a grown man now & still pops in to say hello every now & again.",
            "It is THEIR baggage, not yours!!!\n\nYou are not wrong. Why should you pick up the tab for their screw up?",
            "I have 1 toddler and 1 on the way and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong. I\u2019d rather someone be transparent with me from the beginning. It would save a lot of heartache.",
            "Nope. You get to define what you want and not wanting kids is part of that. In any form. I\u2019m also a 33 year old woman who doesn\u2019t want kids. I recently married a guy with a 9 year old son that he has half the time. But the kid is a literal angel and the coparenting relationship with his ex wife is really healthy.  If those things were different I\u2019m not sure I would have signed on.",
            "No, you can never be in the wrong for not wanting to date someone, for any reason. Period. If you don't want to date them, then don't date them.",
            "That's called preference. I mean I wouldn't date anyone who doesn't have good hygiene, and no one has the right to dictate me on that",
            "I will never date a man with children again. When I was in my mid 30's I met a man with 2 lovely kids who I got on with really well but I didn't realise I was being pulled into a very toxic situation between him & his ex wife. He turned out to be an abusive narcissist & I was very lucky to get away from him. The kids made it difficult to leave as I had a strong bond with them- he used them to gain my trust & pull me in. I was in that relationship for less than a year but have spent 5 yrs in therapy and i am still paying for that mistake with low self esteem & social anxiety.\n\nI know that's an extreme situation but I do think it's good to be aware of what you may be walking into. As we get older you will be eliminating a big chunk of the dating pool if you cut people with kids out so if you do, make sure to have strong boundaries. I think it's a red flag or at least not wise to meet the kids for a good while (6 months?) - I would talk about this, if they're keen for you too meet soon I would say not until you have a good feel for the person youre dating. I would take note of the relationship they have with the other parent, how do they talk about them - it may not be their fault the relationship is difficult but if they bad mouth them and talk ugly about them that's a red flag for me. Be careful not to be used as ammunition against the ex partner- keep out of things & have strong boundaries here too.",
            "Not really.  Dating someone with kids is almost always agreeing to a more complicated relationship with more than 1 other person.",
            "I think it\u2019s more than fair to not want to date someone for ANY reason. It\u2019s your life and your relationship, nobody else\u2019s opinion should matter. Which I guess negates this comment but it\u2019s true nonetheless",
            "I *probably* wouldn't have a problem dating someone with teenage kids (kids you can leave home alone for a day or two) \n\nI wouldn't date someone with small kids, I want to go on weekend trips together\n\nBut I am 21, so people my age don't really have teenage kids...",
            "You\u2019re by no means obligated to date anyone? If you see a potential issue with their lifestyle, you\u2019re allowed to not date them, especially if you\u2019re dating with intention. I\u2019ve found that step parents who became step parents without really wanting to usually tend to harbor a bit of hostility usually unintentionally, and that\u2019s never fair to a child. So if anything, choosing to avoid this isn\u2019t selfish it\u2019s selfless.",

            "I have seen through friends and family issues at times when one dates a person that has kids, like u said that person becomes a parental figure.  Point being make sure u and the significant other are on same page with co parenting if u are living under same roof. I see way to often where the kids come for example on the weekend and go crazy where if something is said or done by the boyfriend/girlfriend the mom may not agree with you disciplining or correcting them when they are in the wrong.  Even though they are not ur kids, dont plan on having kids... that can cause arguments between two people when one is in that environment.",
            "No",
            "Depends on the age of the kids. I'd be happier to date a man with teenagers upwards because I know they'll be doing their own thing than a man with a toddler. More because I want some attention and (most of the time) young kids are attention sucking snotty gremlins.",
            "No, I think that is completely fine.",
            "I don't care if your preference is not dating anyone with five toes on each foot - it's still your preference, and preferences aren't wrong. How you go about it can definitely be rude, though, but that doesn't seem to be the main issue here.",

            "No. You have your preferences. Period.",
            "I am 34 and married, I don\u2019t want children - we don\u2019t want children! It is very reasonable, to not want to date someone with children. When I first started dating my husband, he said he could never date someone that had a kid. It wasn\u2019t so much the responsibility of caring for a child but not wanting to have doubts on whether the woman he would be potentially dating had feelings still for the kids father. Children are a big responsibility and it\u2019s okay to want that in your life.",
            "I don\u2019t want kids and won\u2019t date someone with kids. Thought having an adult kid would be ok, but now I am stuck with a grandkid and an adult that I can\u2019t get rid of even tho I am not the biggest fan of them",
            "People have kids for selfish reasons in the first place so to hell with em",
            "It's pretty simple if you see it from their perspective. They thought they had it all. Decided to have kids in some cases to early. It didn't work out. They are single now, feel entitled to a relationship. They already bring baggage so they don't want someone else with kids. Now they're pissed of nobody without baggage wants them.",
            "I don\u2019t think there is anything wrong with it, especially you don\u2019t want kids! If you want to be in a committed relationship, you would have to commit to the kids as well.\n\nI want kids someday, but I\u2019m not mature enough for something like that now. I\u2019m not ready for that kind of commitment.",
            "You\u2019re allowed to have whatever dealbreakers you want. \n\nAlso, you\u2019ll have to come to terms with the fact that the child\u2019s mother will likely always have some sort of presence in the man\u2019s life, so keep that in mind.",
            "Of course not. It's vital to be honest with yourself before you get into something like that.",
            "I have kids and I think it\u2019s your choice. No hard feelings.",

            "Do what makes you happy as long as it doesn't harm others.

You're firm on not wanting kids. You've made your mind up. And you need someone who will understand and respect that and share that stance, because it's a pretty damn important stance to share. It's not \"Well, I normally don't date people with long hair,\" or \"We both hate washing the dishes, but *one* of us has to.\" Kids are a huge investment of time, money, and energy. Nobody should *expect* everyone to want to make that investment.\n\nAlso, that guy calling *you* selfish because *he* wasn't up-front about having kids and you had to find out through other means... to hell with him. He has some nerve.",
            "It's okay to not date anyone for any reason",

At that period in my life I wouldn\u2019t have had shit to offer them except kind of being a bad influence.  Like, I smoked cigarettes, I\u2019m a pothead, do you want me getting stoned in front of your kids all day, because I\u2019m gonna be getting stoned all day.  I don\u2019t know how to care for a child at all, I\u2019m ADD\u2019d to the gills, I can barely keep my own appointments and shit, do you really want me ever in charge of keeping theirs?  I was having trouble getting my own coursework done for college, you think I\u2019m going to be able to help them with shit?
