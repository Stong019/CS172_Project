            "Reasons why this does not disprove time travel\n\n1. Announcing to the world that you're a time traveller would disrupt the space time continuum\n\n2. If someone had tried, the time police would be after them\n\n3. Time travel being public knowledge is dangerous. They wouldn't want everyone having access to the technology. If it's an individual they're keeping it secret out of perceived benevolence or greed. If it's an institution, it's trying to keep that power for it's self i.e. a world government with time travel capability. So a future individual or institution would not want other individuals or institutions to also try accessing time travel and especially not people from the past because it would danger future peoples' existance\n\n4. Depends on how time travel works. Many would argue that going back in time would create another timeline in which a time traveler appears and future is different. We're still living in the timeline where no one has made time travel public knowledge. Meanwhile there's an alternate universe where a time traveller told the world in the 1980s or something.",

So the next day I went over to his house to make sure he was okay, on his meds, etc, and he showed me something called he called a flux capacitor. He asked me if I wanted to go to the year 3000, and I was like yeah sure (didn't think it would work). \n\nNext thing I knew, a flash of light consumed me, and I was in the future. The year 3000 to be exact. \n\nThe first thing I saw was a woman floating above the ground, with hair like something out of a star wars movie. She greeted us because apparently it's a normal thing in the future. I couldn't believe it. She gave me a brief rundown of history from 2019 till then, and apparently global warming had basically consumed the earth. All but the richest people lived under water. I used what we would call a computer to check and see what happened to my family and stuff. So I guess the band I was in ends up making it pretty big, even outselling Kelly Clarkson.

We may only exist due to the altering of some original timeline.  \n\nOne of my heroes, Richard Feynman, said that time travel is practically impossible; that a time traveler would have to be capable of taking every single particle in the universe and reverse it back to their destination point in the past or future.

Look at it this way: If time travel to the past ever becomes possible, from that point on until the end of the universe it's going to be possible for people to come back to this period of history. Given that Earth's population is currently doubling every 60 years (approximately), there could easily be, for example, quadrillions of us by the year 3000.\n\nSo that's potentially quadrillions of years where unbelievably huge numbers of people could visit us. The odds that none of them chose to, or that they did but managed to do so undetected **every time**, seem vanishingly small. So, either time travel to the past is restricted in some way, or it likely isn't possible.",

Even if there is no faster than light travel, it only takes 3.5 million years to explore the milky way galaxy, which we have calculated should have hundreds of thousands of intelligent civilizations in it. Statistically, it should have happened by now.\n\nMost of the reasoning is that,  \n1. We are the first, there was some large event that made life impossible before we came into existence.  \n2. There is a \"great filter\" that wipes out intelligent life that we have not yet (but probably will) encounter\n3. We somehow are one of the few species to make it past the great filter\n\nOther answers include\n- we're in a rural part of the galaxy, with no real reason to visit us  \n- intelligent civilizations have decided it's not respectful or smart to visit us  \n- they may wait until we're more developed before visiting  \n- or there may be hostile civilizations, that once you broadcast a signal to they subsequently destroy you\n\n\nThis is all from my astronomy 101 class, so take it with a grain of salt but at the very least it was interesting. Furthermore, the drake equation which is used to calculate the probability of other intelligent life existing is a bit problematic, because we obviously don't know very well how likely intelligent life is to form since we only know of 1 intelligent species.",
            "You cannot travel back and forth in your own timeline. And I\u2019ll explain why.\n\nLet\u2019s start with traveling to the past. You can travel back in time and kill hitler.

Just because you killed him doesn\u2019t mean that my timeline magically changes like it does in the movies. Now if you kill Hitler and try to go back to 2019, you will go back to a world you don\u2019t recognize. It could be a better world or a fucked up world. Believe it or not, killing Hitler could have a huge negative impact on the world.\n\nNow let\u2019s pretend you travel 200 years into the future. You will be visiting a world where in 2019 you walked out of your house (because you time traveled), and nobody ever saw you again.

And that's not to say that someone HAS come back but just didn't reveal themselves, or it might be that this just isn't an interesting enough time to visit",
            "What if its like in dragon ball and when you go back you go to an alternate timeline? Then we'd never find out how or if it worked until they come back",
            "It just proves that a future doesn't exist.",
            "We don't know if anyone from the future is currently visiting our present",
            "I don\u2019t know that they haven\u2019t. I\u2019ve had a few instances of random people giving me advice which I didn\u2019t appreciate at the time. That advice usually turned out well so...",
            "Maybe they have but they put back all the....wait, sorry that\u2019s a spoiler.",
            "I can\u2019t remember the specific video, but there was a scientist who theorized about time machines, and with his idea of the way it would work if he could make it happen in a perfect situation, you would only be able to travel back as far as the time machine itself had existed. \n\nDefinitely brightened me up after I had the same thought as you.",
            "My theory is that similar to rocket ships, the government has limited civilian use of time traveling machines so regular people cant use them. This allows the government to hand pick who goes back in time and gives them incredibly rigorous training to make sure they know everything about the time they visit, including everything that HAS happened and everything that HAS NOT happened. \n\nThe time travelers are among us, theyre just trained so well to blend in that theyve changed things without us even realizing that they know whats going to happen without that change.",
            "I\u2019ve always had this theory that maybe time travelers require some type of written approval/request from an individual living in the destination time period before travel can be approved. And it can\u2019t just a simple request/authorization statement on a piece of paper. It has to be in a certain format that includes specific information and maybe supporting documentation. \n\nI just picture this guy in the year 3050 saying to the time travel agent \u201cLook, this letter from my great great great great grandfather clearly asks me to visit him if time travel is ever invented!\u201d And the agent would sigh and say \u201csir, as I already explained to the person in front of you, all requests from past timeline individuals must be completed on a 10-40b form. If such form was not available during their time period, the individual from that time period must provide a written explanation as to why such form was not used.\u201d \n\nThe whole ordeal would be terrible tedious and would make time travel for non business related purposes a headache.",
            "Nope, there are plenty of reasons it could technically exist but we don't know of any time travelers.\n\nOne reason is that we never got to the chance to invent it (extinction).",
            "Or maybe in the grand scheme of things this time period is not that interesting, maybe they don't want to bring back long gone diseases",
            "I\u2019d like to think that there are time travelers visiting us right now, but they stealthily watch us through some kind of invisibility-cloaked time safari bus hovering 10-20 feet off the ground so they don\u2019t touch anything that could potentially change the future for them.\n\nWho knows how advanced their technology is, or what they are able to see. We are a tourist attraction for future folk. You know that eerie feeling of being watched? It\u2019s them.",
            "What makes you so sure no one from the future has ever visited us?\n\n *X-Files^theme^song^playing^...*",
            "There are lots of possibilities:\n-\tiirc there is some dispute to the physical possibility of traveling to the past, only traveling to the future would be possible \n-\tresponsibility (think Star Treks First directive) forbids it\n-\ttravelers have some form of cloaking technology or disguise, preventing us from noticing\n-\tthey might travel back to a point in our future, so it could still happen. technically we can never know for sure until someone arrives or we develop the technology\n-\tit\u2019s actually impossible",
            "Time travel will be invented in the year 2086 by the Russian government. It will not be sophisticated enough to transport biological matter until 3034. While time travel becomes possible it erases any and all knowledge of the future as in the past the future doesn't exist, resulting in time travelers becoming amnesiacs contributing to the expanding global population problem. \n\nNow time travel is the most illegal act in the Global Federal Union. Violations result in death for all immediate genetic relatives.\n\nI only share this because no one will believe it.",
            "There are people who claim to be visiting us from the future tho so....",
            "\"Since nobody from the future has ever come to visit us\" ... How do you know? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe there are some people who actually come from the future but they just don't tell anyone. Maybe its some kind of basic rule not to tell. If somebody walked up to you and tells you he/she is from the future, would you actually believe it? I definitely would not.",
            "Time travel has been disproved many times. The idea of \u00ab\u00a0time\u00a0\u00bb itself does not exist physically but is merely a numerical representation of material change. It\u2019s basically an aid to humans to measure what\u2019s happening in front of us. Going back in time would be like physically moving all the particles in the world back to where they were before.",
            "Since someone with the ability to time travel has the ability to essentially view all outcomes of their actions, they may have1 seen what it was like time travelling and telling people, and then realizing it was a bad idea, undone that",
            "There is a ton of people out there claiming they came to visit us from the future. But hey, nobody believes them ;)",
            "We haven\u2019t figured out how to travel through time yet, so it won\u2019t exist right now. We will much later though, at a time when we\u2019ve physically evolved. So seeing a \u201chuman\u201d time travel is impossible. I believe this is where \u201caliens\u201d come in to play.",
            "Someone else has probably said this below, but it could also mean that the act of time travel creates an identical universe. You could travel back, but you would never be seen again in the universe you left, nor would your actions after travelling affect the universe you left. Only the new one that you created would be affected by your actions. I think that theory actually clears up a number of paradoxes, but it's time travel, so paradoxes would still abound.",
            "Someone said (Joe Rogan???) UFOs that we used to see (the blurry photo era) are Time travelers visiting looking at how we used to live, similiar to us going to museum but live action.\n\nAnd the reason that we do not see UFOs anymore is because the current and forseeable future is already so well documented by smartphones that they do not need to come back (here)."

            "I'm also like that, I don't actively look for relationships, but I'm not opposed to one, if I meet someone I like I might date, but that happens organicaly. \n\nHave you ever heard about the korean term Honjok? You might find it interesting.",
            "Also in the eternal single club. Never dated, never cared to date and not dreaming of some partner to sweep me of my feet. \n\nWith dating, if it happens it happens, if not then not. But I am not going to pine for something I don't care about.",
            "I don't know how \"normal\" it is, but I'm in the same boat and I'm not suffering for it. It would be nice to have a partner if they were someone I could really love and not end up resenting, but a good portion of my 20s was spent in relationships that I wouldn't want again and I'm looking forward to living my life how I want... which is generally \"comfortable\" and \"quiet.\"",
            "Besides possibly being aromantic, dating is also just a lot of hard work. Especially finding someone to date without the situation presenting itself spontaneously. Just relax and enjoy the single life.",
            "I'm asexual, which greatly influences my general lack of fondness for dating, but I prefer being single also. I like the -idea- of a partner, but I do not at all like actually having to share my space, devote less time to my hobbies, or arrange my life around someone else's wants. It's not worth the trade-off to me.\n\nGimme books and good food. It's all I need.",
            "no, i can understand this, i wasnt looking for a girlfriend or had no desire to get into a relationship i just ended up falling in love with her, but going home to an empty house and having all your time to yourself isnt a strange concept to me",

            "There's a charm in being your own person and comfortable with yourself and your life. If you don't desire dating, then you should feel free to pursue the things you want and love. I wouldn't even worry about \"normal.\" Nobody is normal.",
            "Lack of desire to date is strong in my in-laws' family. My wife's aunts (both of them), her brother and sister, and our nephew all enjoy single-hood.  \n\nI think the tendency probably has a genetic component but also... The choice was always okay in her family. No pressure to \"Get married and start giving us grandchildren!\" By the time my mother in law and her sisters were in their 20's, both their parents were dead, so there was no pressure to date. For the next generation there was already a precedent.\n\nHopefully you don't experience that much pressure. My in-laws would have been likely to make their hypothetical partners crazy. They're much happier as they are.",

I'm simply out of damn to give for looking. I'm the point that I can't even point it at my lack of self-esteem anymore. I'm not lonely enough to fix it, and I'm happy enough with my life not to rock the boat.",

            "I think it is pretty normal it's just that you don't hear about it. Like the internet is full of people who are bitter and love to complain about being single. People who are perfectly happy and content with the single life don't really talk about it and make as much noise as the upset people. This is a case of a loud minority.",
            "It's definitely \"normal\" for a subset of the population. You might be asexual, or aromantic (these are real actual states of being which are fine), or have a naturally low libido. Or it may just not be something that matters to you right now, but could be someday down the road. \n\nThe important thing is whether you feel satisfied in life. Are you happy? Do you enjoy your day-to-day activities? Not depressed or feeling like something is missing? If you're contented, then you're good. Don't let anybody tell you you have to be experiencing \\[x\\] or your life is coming up short. So you're alone and happy?

A relationship seems fun and it would be nice to have a companion but then I think about having to care about their feelings and not being able to do what I want to do, and that turns me off.     \nAlso seeing a lot of people in broken relationships turns me off from dating as well.

            "I used to get upset at being single, I chased toxic relationships all day and night, had an engagement or two blow up in my face, always trying to please the other person, seeking unconditional approval. Then, I got a cat which worships the ground I walked on and I began focusing on me, improving my life. I went from obese to muscular, got into university, converted to Judaism\u2014-all things I wanted to do since I was a kid, and the big one, leaving my hick-town to live in a big city. Once in the big city, with prying eyes off me for the first time ever and the stigma gone, I started seeing a therapist, working through my issues. \n\nNow, 8 years on, I mean if a cute guy or woman crosses my path, I\u2019ll put on the charm, if things work out then I\u2019ll go on a few dates.

The nice thing about my relationship is that nothing has really changed there. Sure we do things together quite often but we also frequently find ourselves doing separate things but together in the living room. It's nice to have him there without constantly having to do the same things. I'm very happy and peaceful, which I attribute in large part to all that time I spent being perfectly content on my own. There was no hole in my life I needed him to fill, instead he compliments my lifestyle and makes it better rather than \"completing\" me.",

            "My mom taught me that it\u2019s better to not date until you are comfortable being with yourself. If you can\u2019t keep yourself happy, entertained, content then you aren\u2019t ready to do that for someone else. So it sounds to me like you\u2019re just mature, independent and sensible. Taking care of yourself, and letting life roll out as it will. Very uncommon. Also, not letting your happiness depend on someone else is very healthy and I think when the right person walks by, you\u2019ll be more prepared emotionally than most to have a solid relationship if\nyou choose. You\u2019re doing great OP, and have nothing to worry about. Everyone should be so lucky as to know the feeling you\u2019re talking about, it\u2019s very hard to achieve for a lot of people.",

            "I'm better off being single. I don't wanna go through all the bullshit drama that comes with a relationship. Why waste my time and energy on someone who'll just stab me in the back and paint me as the bad guy? Not worth it.",

As much as I enjoy spending time with friends / family, and sex with casual partners, the thought of having to share my home with someone full time / never having alone time just stresses me the hell out haha\n\nEnjoying/ thriving in alone time is a great quality to have, because ultimately many people end up alone (even if they get married / have kids - people die, families fall out, even adults kids with great relationships with their parents often only see them during holidays etc - me being one of them!)",
            "It's normal. Honestly, I choose not to because it keeps me from getting in a relationship where I get cheated on. I'm better off being single when I know that anybody I could potentially get with is probably fake anyway. So you're not alone there.",

Just too busy with other stuff, pursuing other interests, and all I really want at the end of the day is the come home, relax with the dogs, read, and do other things. I do not want to share space or converse all the time. Sounds exhausting. I do that all day.\n\nI was in a relationship a little while back. It was nice. I liked her a lot. But it was also exhausting and her needs and my needs really did not gel well. Couple that with living in a place without a lot of prospects, and it is what it is!

            "I'm in a similar boat.  Now normal is a weird word, because I'd say that most people people have a desire to date people.  Now that being said, I'd say it isn't uncommon to find people similar people.  The more I've attempted to date the more I realize Its not for me or I'm not ready for it.  I remember in my early 20s finding an interesting girl on a dating website, and after we exchanged numbers I quickly realized that was not what I wanted.  I felt annoyed that she would want to call and talk, like I was wasting my time.  When I hang out with friends, and I heard how their SOs act, or feel the need to call them over little things I get really annoyed.

            "More normal that you'd think, I bet. There is nothing wrong with singlehood. The idea that single people are sad, lonely, or \"missing out\" on something is wrong. The thing is this: everyone has relationships, but not everyone wants a romantic one. Healthy romantic relationships are great! Healthy platonic relationships are great! You can have both of course, but any suggestion that you can't be equally happy without the romantic one is ridiculous.",
            "If you wonder if you\u2019re missing out, you could try dating and if it\u2019s something you enjoy and wish you had more drive for, then you could address that in therapy or something. But really, if you\u2019re happy not dating, don\u2019t wish you wanted to date or \u2018fix\u2019 anything, then I would just be happy being you!! I think it\u2019s like people who are asexual vs people with low libido for some reason or another. If you want to have sex but feel like something has happened to your sex drive, a doctor might be able to help, but if you\u2019re truly asexual, then there\u2019s nothing to \u2018fix\u2019. If you would like to date but anxiety gets in your way or you have some other issue you want to work through, a therapist might be able to help. But if you\u2019re aromantic, then just be you!

Some people will try to force their perception of happiness on you. Often it's from a place of caring, but they aren't you and will never be.\n\nSociety and biology require many of us to procreate so the human race can continue. If that doesn't apply to you, then don't fall victim to it. \n\nIf you are concerned with perception or feel like something might be off, I recommend finding a therapist or a life coach to dive deeper into who you are.",

I had no intentions of settling down and just wanted to hang with my boys, party, workout and whatever else interested me at the time. However, I kind of came up on the cusp of the dating app boom and never really used them and same for the women that I was interested in. So, I guess it was kind of natural to date because we weren\u2019t meeting on the Internet to chat it up there and it seems that with the apps, you get the questions over with there. Plus, it seems women are more liberal about having sex today than they were 10-15 years ago. Today, I\u2019m married with two kids and love every minute of it and have no desire to go back being single. Anyway, I\u2019m rambling, it\u2019s completely normal to feel the way that you do. However, you could change how you feel about wanting to be with someone and maybe even have kids. I started to feel that way as I was leaving my early 30\u2019s.

            "Thank you, it's nice to know I'm not alone. I am not a good girlfriend,  I don't enjoy relationships. I spent my 20's in relationships hurting some really good guys because  everyone wants to be in relationships right? You're weird if you don't? That's how everyone made me feel at least. At 31 I stopped caring and my life has been so much the better for it. Some people are made for relationships and that is great I'm not saying relationships are bad, I love seeing people happy with one another. They are just bad for me.",

            "This is normal and healthy. Dating in itself is largely unpleasant, or at best a gamble. The payoff is a good relationship with *a specific person you love*, not the concept of being in a relationship per se.\n\nSome people *do* seek out a relationship in general; I do not believe they are generally happy, nor frequently successful in this attempt. Red pill/incel communities are very big on this attitude - you can see a lot of anger that they're not in a relationship, but they also clearly despise anyone they might have a relationship with. A lot of mainstream movies and shows also propagate this attitude.\n\nRejection *does* upset people - almost everyone, likely because people who are insensitive to being ostracized by their community were not likely to survive. But that is only a concern if you actively look for a relationship. I think the attitude that being single is sad might come from people who don't actively look for a relationship but believe or feel that they have been rejected anyway. This isn't a sensible attitude, of course. Unless you are famous or very attractive, truly spontaneous courtship is highly unlikely (and the people who do so are generally very unpleasant).",

Given with what's going on in the world with this pandemic, I don't have the time nor energy to invest in partner (I'm an RN working the frontlines).

If you haven\u2019t fallen in love with someone before / really nurtured a relationship properly before then you wouldn\u2019t know how that feels so you probably wouldn\u2019t miss that feeling of connection. Your individual experiences as well as your personality lead to the choices you make and I don\u2019t know them so I\u2019m giving you some stuff to think about but \u2018normal\u2019 isn\u2019t really helpful : there\u2019s healthy and unhealthy choices and only you know what choice you are making. Is your choice to stay single simply because you don\u2019t have the energy right now to nurture a relationship? I think that\u2019s healthy if you\u2019re stressed or can\u2019t give time to someone because you need a rest. Or, is it because rejection hurts; in love rejection is sometimes a healthy choice for both people because the person is not good for you or you aren\u2019t good for them; it\u2019s not always superficial or vindictive. Ultimately, are you avoiding romantic connection because you don\u2019t want to disappoint someone else, BE disappointed, have your current lifestyle shaken up, OR you\u2019re just doing your own thing, in no rush to make a change, because romantic love isn\u2019t that much of a priority to you right now (and may never be)? Love isn\u2019t just thinking about who your dream partner is and looking for them for your dream relationship, you also need to make sure you\u2019re doing enough for them as I\u2019m sure they had dreams and expectations too. I\u2019m not judging you, I have unhealed stuff from my last relationship I\u2019m still working through so I\u2019m very happy on my own but I know there will come a time whether it\u2019s a year, four years, whenever that may be where I will try again because I know exactly what I want and who I want to be about it now. Nobody knows you and what you want other than you : and if you don\u2019t, therapy is really good for exploring stuff like this ^^ \u2018normal\u2019 is outdated, it\u2019s about looking deeper into whether your* decisions are coming from a healthy or unhealthy place in your psyche. \ud83c\udf40",

All the research I've found is about the ability of sound to fuck with them in more subtle ways over time, like mess with their mating habits or drive them away from a place.\n\nMy gut instinct is that this is really hard. First of all, a smaller organism would be *less* vulnerable to pressure changes then a larger one, since the main component is the is the difference in pressure *across the body.* So if you put a human and an ant in the same pressure gradient, the ant will experience a much lower pressure *differential*.\n\nThere's also the matter of internal vs external pressure, but all the things humans have that are most vulnerable to sudden pressure changes, like ear drums and the hollow chest cavity, arthropods don't have. And their exoskeleton would resist pressure changes in a way our skin doesn't.",

But it\u2019s something you don\u2019t really even have to think about consciously, your brain just kinda figures that out instantly. Like with your beverage, you\u2019re going to want it placed in the most convenient spot so you don\u2019t have to reach over your plate or expend more energy than necessary.

            "Every night, rain, hail or shine, pedestal fan is on. I like the noise. It blocks out the other creepy noises.",
            "I can't sleep otherwise.",
            "I feel seen.",
            "Yep. Moving air feels a lot less stuffy, I like the white noise, and contrast of warm/cold is really nice. Triple win for me. In winter I only have it on when I'm in bed, though - our house gets bloody freezing and having a fan going when you're getting showered and dressed in a morning is not fun.",
            "That's the only option I have for keeping the mosquitoes away.",
            "I have a fan in all the rooms I hangout in. Where ever I am I have a fan on for noise. I go nuts \ud83e\udd2a without it. I have to bring or buy a fan whenever I travel.",
            "Guilty",
            "1 sheet, 2 blankets, space heater and separately a fan blasting at me.",
            "Fan AND air conditioner.",
            "Yes. My mom always wants me to turn it off",
            "Hell yeah! I sleep with a fan aimed at me whenever I can. My wife doesn't like it, so I now have to have it on when she's not in bed.",

            "Me too! I have a 6 inch clip on fan about a foot from my face when I sleep . Regardless of how cold  it may be. Can\u2019t sleep without it.",
            "SAME!",
            "I don't have my overhead fan running _all_ year long, but 10 months out of the year, and occasionally even during the other 2 months, it's running nonstop. Southern Alabama gets cold few only a handful of weeks, but my house has crappy insulation so if it's 20-40\u00b0F out, I do turn it off. When the central AC/heater is running and my fan is going, it's a perfect white noise to go to sleep to. Rain works too, as long as there's no lightning/thunder. That crap is going to give me a heart attack at 3am one day and people won't find my body for like a week.",
            "Absolutely. I sleep with all my windows open, so a lovely breeze from them, plus the fan to keep mossies away and give a bit of white noise. Not in peak winter though, when it's colder than 10 degrees overnight, not even the thickest duvet and blankets are enough.",
            "Yes.",

            "I do because the heat in this old building is so uneven. Without the fan, it's bloody hot. With the, I can sleep with blankets. I can't seem to sleep without cuddling up to blankets.",
            "me, but with air conditioning",
            "Hell yes. I also like the white noise.",
            "The sound helps with my tinnitus and also makes blankets more comfortable.",
            "That plus you like the white noise it generates.",
            "Yep. I can\u2019t sleep if it gets too warm, so I like having constant air flow of preferably cold air. This means the fan stays on in the winter too. Best thing about my room is that it is for some reason the coldest room in the house so that makes it even better!",
            "Even in winter, yes. There HAS to be moving air or I feel like I\u2019m suffocating. And 4 blankets.",
            "I work at night and sleep during the day so I need a fan on to drown out the outside noise. It's a nice consistent background noise. In winter I'll just point it away from my bed.",
            "Yes, I need some constant sounds till I get my sleep.\nIrrespective of the weather the fan needs to be on.\nI turn the fan off in the middle of the night when I feel confident enough that I will get sleep.",
            "I turn the box fan on only when I sleep, and I stick it in the corner of the room so that it blows against the wall. I sleep with only one comforter and open the window a crack and I stay warm. I don't turn on the heater while I sleep.",
            "Same here. I live in south asian country, so you can imagine the summers here. Only the thickness of blanket changes according to weather, without a blanket I feel incomplete and cannot sleep.",
            "same, i dont have a ceiling fan anymore but i always need a window open for some sort of airflow. i also hate being too warm like i need a cold room w a breeze under a huge blanket *chefs kiss*",
            "My wife does so I do.\n\nEdit: DOES not DIED big typo",
            "I also much prefer the feeling of moving air",
            "I use fans year round... but air conditioning goes on  in the summer. Dunno if it's just my body being weird, but if I get too warm I start having nightmares and then wake up feeling nauseous and groggy.",
            "This is literally the only way I can sleep",
            "Nobody wants stale air.",
            "Wow I JUST got up and turned the fan on before seeing this",
            "Having the ceiling fan on is the worst thing for sleeping because the wind hits your face preventing you from going into true deep sleep, I suggest to get a fan and have it pointed at you but not going toward your face",
            "Tower fan man here, but yes, absolutely. Doesn\u2019t matter how cold, I NEED the fan. Mound of covers, though, no. I usually sleep with a top sheet and a comforter and that\u2019s it. Again, regardless of how cold.",
            "Yes, usually at least two fans and a weighted blanket.",
            "I have been lately. Even while its been cold.",
            "I cant sleep without a blanket no matter what. Literally blazing hot weather with no power due to hurricane and still need my down comforter. I also have a very hard time falling asleep without a heating pad. That warmth makes me nod off fast. And ear plugs...literally cannoy fall asleep without them. Its been 12 years ive been sleeping with earplugs in. Theres a white noise in my head that they bring out and its so soothing. Need total darkness and Vick's vaporub or vaseline in my nose or it'll dry out. So basically, im a nightmare. I am so specific about sleeping that its a nightmare haha.",
            "Since I was seven years old. Love my fan.",
            "I open up my window but I don't actually open it, it's only unlocked really. Makes sure the air in my room is fresh",
            "For me only my face feels super warm so I need to have my fan on, but my body will get cold so blankets save my life.",
            "Yes!! I have a tiny room that heats up really easily and the air otherwise is just bleh and having a fan on 24/7 helps it not be too stuffy. It was worse in summer before we got AC because it would heat up to like 35\u00b0C since the sun would heat up the room and because it's built to keep heat in during winter, it would be horrible. Now it works the other way around, small room that cools down quickly with the ac on, cool stays inside well even if I turn the ac off for a bit but just leave the fan on. I like the cool air on my face but also I wanna be warm. I try to keep my room around 18-20\u00b0C since I'd happily have it at like 16\u00b0C but I also have a pet corn snake who, even with heating wouldn't be a huge fan. He is a weirdo and goes to the coolest side of the tank like 90% of the time, even when the warm side is reasonable (the warm hide is about 27\u00b0C ish so like not burning hot) but 16\u00b0C is a bit chilly.",
            "I spent 7 years sleeping on the street, I'll never understand people who can only sleep under specific conditions.\n\nI could sleep through an Earthquake while cats fck in the alley next to me.",
            "yep, but its aircon here",
            "I keep my ceiling fans on 24/7. I just enjoy the circulating air. I also live in phx, az",
            "My ideal setting is under a blanket, in front of an air conditioner, outdoors, in the shade on a hot, sunny day. The perfect combination of contradictions.",
            "warm body, cool head is my jam",
            "Yeah boi",
            "If i dont have a blanket on its difficult to sleep, even if its summer. I dont need a weighted one or anything, but thats how it is. As a result, a require a fan a lot of the time to help cool me down.",
            "I will sweat if there is no air movement. Doesn't matter time of year.",
            "In Aus, I need a fan in summer to keep the bloody mozzies off",
            "I need three things to fall asleep.\n1. A fan,or equivalent noise,for the background.\n2. At least one decently thick blanket. I need to feel covered,even in the dead of summer; I don't know why.\n3. I need to have my feet tucked _inside_ the blanket, with said blanket over and under my feet. Again,not sure why. It just feels the most natural and comfortable.",
            "consider a white noise machine",
            "Yes, I can\u2019t sleep without blankets but neither without a fan.",
            "The A/C went out at my house last summer so I started sleeping with a fan again. I haven\u2019t turned it off since and I really enjoy the white noise and the breeze for whenever I get hot. I never used to sleep with one on because it would make me have to pee in the middle of the night. Fun fact: it still does. I just deal with it though. It\u2019s even a remote controlled one so when I get in bed or wake up I can just turn it on or off",
            "I am a fan of this as well, but with the added perk of a cpap machine. I get noise and air movement from the fan, a mountain of blankets to keep warm, and fresh, cool air to breathe that doesn't impact the sub-blanket temp from the cpap.",
            "We've just learnt my husband can no longer sleep without the white noise from my air purifier. I didn't turn it on a few nights ago because I needed to change the filter. He woke up half hourly all night until we figured the problem",
            "Yep! I have my AC set at 68, have my over head fan on as well as a big fan directly next to my bed that i put on high. Then bury myself in blankets",
            "It could also be the \u201cwhite noise\u201d that\u2019s also soothing to you.  I sometimes sleep with my fan on too.  It just makes a person sleep better, in my opinion.  There\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting the fan on while you sleep.  Keep up with your, not so kooky way of going to bed.  Namaste my friend.",
            "I literally feel like I can\u2019t breathe without a fan on.",
            "Yeah, I have a really active mind at night (IH) and so a helps to block out all the noise so I sleep more solidly. I imagine the case is the same for people without a disorder",
            "Yes. Every night. My hands, feet and face can get hot at any point so I need to the cool air to sleep. Plus it acts as white noise at this point so I can't sleep without a similar sound.",
            "I like sound and air movement",
            "Yes.. warm stale air sucks",
            "I sleep in a room with no fan or lights, only a window.",
            "I have a fan on in winter, as well as summer, because I can't sleep in total silence (or total darkness). But in the winter, the fan is aimed at the wall.",
            "Yes",
            "I have my fan on high all year around. Sleeping in the cold makes snuggling into your blankets all the more comfortable. In the wintertime, I\u2019ll turn off the fan and turn on the heater as soon as I get out of bed.",
            "My wife has to have the fan on for noise. I get hot at night so I dont mind but I'm the one that started her addiction to it.",

            "Get a weighted blanket and a white noise machine. You're welcome.",
            "My logic is the opposite of yours. I love sleeping under a mound of blankets, but in order for the blankets to be comfortable, they have to be significantly warmer than the rest of the room (more like, the rest of the room has to be cold), so I turn the fan on to cool the room down.",
            "Yeah, I've been doing this for years.",
            "I thought I would be the only one. I stopped it because I was afraid of the power bill, lmao",
            "I hate all the noise my fan makes, but I also equally hate how humid it can get under my blankets. The dilemma...",

            "You're the reason the earth is burning. Also yes I do the same sometimes",
            "Fan on, window open. I\u2019ve lived in places that hit -30\u00b0C and that window is open. Heated blankets are the best.",
            "Let me guess, tropical country?",
            "Everyone hates being in cars with me for this exact reason. I don't give a fuck how cold it is and that you want the window closed, the AC makes it hard to breathe, and breathing is more important than being warm.",
            "Nah, nobody, literally just you. Why do you do this???",
            "I can't do that at all. Just the noise would keep me awake and I'd be extremely uncomfortable with my face and the air I breathe being that much colder than the rest of me.\n\nAnd I think a lot of you would be better off just taking your mountain of blankets and sleeping outside. Lol ffs",
            "Not always, of course, but often enough for it to be a thing, people that sleep under blankets (even though it's hot) were abused as children.\n\nThe blankets become armour/protection from the abuser, even if the abuser is long gone.",

            "Yep!",

            "I only leave the OnlyFans on while hiding under the blankets... also to hide the air.",
            "I keep my AC on \"fan\" even in winter.  I like the moving air and the white noise helps me sleep undisturbed.",

            "Unrelated, is this where that meme of the guy stopping his friend from catcalling came from?",
            "Other people have pretty much covered it.\n\nThey are currently doing ones about race because it's a popular topic they can exploit. It's not like someone has just invented racism and they are reacting to first hearing about it ffs.",
            "The same day it aired there was a NASCAR event where they had woman with leather suits with Gillette pasted over their asses. The hypocrisy pissed me off. I use dollar shave club now.",
            "Because it looks opportunistic and insincere.",
            "Because Gillette who charge double price for pink razors have no place to comment on toxic masculinity. It's just corporate opportunism.\n\nTo answer your last question, yes it would have been better as a PSA. Gillette do not actually care about toxic masculinity, they only care about profits.",
            "Some marketing critics saw the spot as an ad for \\*women\\* since more women are transitioning to men's razors purely because of the price difference. A cynical person could accept that.\n\nGillette: Rape is bad. So are high prices.",
            "You can't open up a nuanced conversation about gender identity with an ad that both condemns the behaviors of men and asks those same men for their money. Gillette bet too much on their brand name, they didn't think they would take a hit, underestimated the sheer volume of cheap competitors with better or comparable product.",
            "\"Hey all you men out there. Stop being assholes. Buy our products\".  \nWhen that's the message of your ad then people aren't going to want to buy your stuff.",
            "They had built up a brand of not really throwing their hat into the ring in terms of commenting on current issues and people knew them as more of just a product supplier for male grooming. [They had lots of ad campaigns that were just about showing positive images of men being fathers and good role models and being successful at work and contributing to society](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAkVDCqVY6w). It was a very standard ad campaign for the time. So when they decided to make this new one it seemed more like a cynical cash grab or an excuse to be as inflammatory as possible and get people talking about it by casting a massive wide net and accusing huge swathes of people of being scumbags or being accessories to crimes and that we will never have the capacity for empathy or understanding suffering or how others feel and we need to be talked down to. Imagine if there was any other ad campaign aimed at any other type of demographic or group where it basically reinforced the worst qualities or stereotypes about them and the controversy that would cause? The whole thing is very insincere and disingenuous and it's more about weaponizing social media and making people irritated about a hot button issue.",
            "Imagine a women\u2019s product company bringing out an ad saying \"Are you sure you\u2019re doing everything you can to not be such a massive bitch?\"",
            "People don't like being preached to about toxic masculinity and objectifying women by a company that previously ran ads that were literally just a bunch of girl's butts.\n\n\nI'm shocked!",
            "Telling your main customer base they are \u201ctoxic\u201d and need to change is a really bad marketing idea. Guys just want to buy razors.",
            "Personally I hated it because they acting like being a piece of shit was the default for men rather than the exception. The whole tone of the ad was \"Men sure do suck. They should do better. BUY OUR CHEAP PLASTIC SHIT WOMEN\" \n\nAlso there's the fact that they seemed to think that it was our job to police the behavior of ALL men just because we are also men. That's totally asinine and applied to any specific race or gender aside from men it would have been seen as explicitly racist and/or sexist.",
            "I see a lot of people here guessing at why but the real reason was because it was extremely offensive to the average man. The advert played on cliches and made the blanket assumption that poor behaviour of a small minority of men was representative of all men. Men who had been good fathers were tired of being blamed for the actions of a tiny minority. \n\nIt was yet another example of the vilification of masculinity and men revolted. Gillette practically handed a huge percentage of their market share to their competitors thanks to feminist activism. \n\nPeople  may not like that answer but it's exactly what happened.",
            "The way to gain customers is not to make an ad essentially calling ALL of your target audience toxic shitbags",
            "Hey, you... our target market...stop being such pieces of shit.",
            "Why would people want a product that preaches to them or says negative things about them. How well would lady speed stick do if they had a commercial that boiled down to \u201chey ladies calm down your being too emotional\u201d.",
            "Because, simply put, it puts all men into a single category, and invalidates the daily struggle men go through to make our lives livable.\n\nPeople would be enraged (and rightfully so) if such an advertisement was placed for women.",
            "The ad talks to all men about a minority. How would a muslim react if an ad talked about all muslims that terrorrism is bad, while broadcasting pictures of Ramadam, hijab, etc... ?",
            "[deleted]",
            " I feel weird getting preached to by a fucking razor company. \n\nThere's lots of commercials that try to co-opt social issues for themselves, like when beauty product commercials pivoted to different body representation instead of the standard people they choose as models. I was more open to that, because that seemed like them making a course correction. Like \"OK, we screwed up a bit with our old advertising approach, we get that. Here, let's try something different.\" It seemed like a positive approach, where they're trying to lift up the people they had previously been kinda putting down. \n\nThis is more like \"Hey, our customer base, what the hell is wrong with you? Be better.\" Which is not a totally baseless thing to say, but I don't want to hear it from some megacorp. Because by that same sultural analysis, male oriented advertising probably contributed a bit to the culture of toxic masculinity. So calling out toxic masculinity is fine, but when it comes from them it feels like a deflection away from their own degree of culpability.",
            "Lifelong Gillette customer, I will never buy any product from the Gillette brand for the rest of my life",
            "Because the most important rule of selling is respecting your costumers, Gillette just said in that comercial \u201cmen are full of bullshit and must change, so buy our Gillette against masculinity\u201d. The real question here should be why Gillette made that comercial instead of showing some of good qualities of masculinity and embrace that.",
            "No clue. \n\nLet's set up a tampon commercial that targets toxic femininity. We can have snippets where girlfriends and moms warn each other that being a queen bitch is uncool, stop the mental tormenting and headgames and teach women that gossip is toxic behaviour.\n\nMaybe the women can then answer you why they did not like it.",
            "For me it was the way it was delivered. The ad itself was toxic as fuck and basically said \"all men are shitty. We're sorry for being shit.\" Meanwhile these pricks are gouging women for razors.",
            "\"Toxic Masculinity\" is just a collection of negative male stereotypes. Imagine if they made a commercial about \"toxic femininity\" and depicted women cat fighting over shoes  or being terrible drivers or other negative female stereotypes and then ended with the note \"we can be better.\" Wouldn't many women find such a commercial unbearably condescending and sexist? Well that's what a lot of men felt about the actual commercial.",
            "It\u2019s obvious why it flopped. Its irritating. It feels like it\u2019s jumping on a bandwagon, and more importantly it seems to saying that most men who use their products are bullies, violent and sexual harrassers. \n\nThe whole thing is patronising - especially \u201cis this really the best a man can get?\u201d\u2026 who are they asking that question to? Because it certainly doesn\u2019t apply to me (yes I\u2019m a man). \n\nMaybe they should show that ad in prisons. For your average guy it\u2019s insulting .",
            "Because it came across that all masculinity is toxic, that being a man is thus a disease. That we are incompetent fathers, casual bystanders to the abuses going on around us. That we all wear shorts and have big round bellies and stand behind BBQs spurting cliched phrases. \n\nExaggerating, but that is the effect of the advert. The fact that their was one good dad, this one good man, in a line of twenty fathers. Says a lot about the other nineteen doesnt it. \n\nI understand the premise of the advert, dont get me wrong, but it was executed shockingly. And most importantly, it was done in the pretence of sincerity, when really, they just want you to buy Gilletes crap razorblades that only last two or three shaves. \n\nAlso, a lot of men dont subscribe to the toxic masculinity idealogue. We just believe that some blokes are dickheads, but it's not any fault in their gender (or the percieved cultural impacts that have moulded it into a gender fault). \n\nWhomever thought it was a good idea for an advert, was not thinking straight. PSA? Maybe, it would be a good platform to approach it as it's the best selling razor I suppose, but people dont want to be preached to by big corps and product marketers, or anybody with an obvious agenda.",

            "Ok, so there are multiple parts here. I'll start with the political.\n       \nFrom a political standpoint, they're basically preaching to a demographic that's not likely to be targeted in the PSA portion of this. Unfortunately this is true for nearly all videos that follow this format (BLM, LGBTQ vids, etc).  There's absolutely no chance that the people doing all the bad things in the video will change because of the video, so basically it's just dumping a lot of guilt and blame at the feet of many men that respect women and treat them as equals. The misogynists will simply dismiss the message, and the rest of the guys will resent the message because they're going to be collateral damage from the video.\n          \nSecond is the business standpoint. The goal of an advertisement is to make money.  There is no other reason to put out an ad. If they cared about the issue, they'd get WAY MORE bang for their buck investing in groups that help support women. This ad is aimed at literally one type of man, and that's the one that wants to virtue signal that he's doing what he can to support women, while not actually doing anything to support women. I'd wager this was backed by some kind of market research that showed a significant population of men that behaved this way that also used some competitor's razor, simply due to image. Therefore, if Gillette promotes an image these guys can adapt and push, they stood to gain the loyalty of this population, and likely didn't expect any other demographic to change much.\n          \nThe last is the product itself. It's a razor. I know there are guys out there that will go on subreddits and discuss all the intricacies of blades, widths, handles, types of shaves, etc.  I would also wager that the VAST MAJORITY of men grab a razor that appears to give the best value at the time they need to shave.  In fact, there's probably a good number that have even lower standards than that. Because it's a razor, and as long as it shaves the hair off my face, I really don't give a shit about much else.  I might be swayed by seeing information about how the company operates that is better than the competition, but honestly any kind of PR piece on them I'm going to just assume is targeted advertising. They don't put information out there that they don't intend to help sell razors, because that's their business.  And that's pieces like, \"We promote lots of women from within, and here's what they have to say about it!\", not \"If you don't buy our razors, you're a woman-hating piece of dog shit that's responsible for hundreds of years of mysogeny.\"",

The other issue was proclaiming a woman by the name of Anna O'Brien, who goes by the user Glitter and Lazers on social media, as healthy. Anna is morbidly obese.\n\nThe \"woke\" advertising comes off as the company raised prices of its razors to levels which required retailers to put the products under lock and key.\n\nIt also charged more for razors \"targeted to women\", often with colors like aquamarine and pink.

At no point does it show guys looking out for each other; comforting a friend who's hurting, spending guy time and having fun, or just feeling confident after a shave. The message is, in my opinion, \"you're okay, you're one of the good ones, but you need to fix the other men out there  because most men are cavemen\". At no point does it consider that men and women are both capable of appalling behaviour, but rather that only one is. At no point does a guy intercede on a man's behalf unless it's to defend him from another man.\n\nShaving has nothing to do with an agenda that 'men are trash, let's fix them'.

Are most men are sexist and misogynist? Probably not. So. I'm just minding my own business then bam you are sexist and evil. But Buy our products. You are bad. wtf can I do?\n\n  \n**Do I get a say in this?**\n\n  \nI'd say it's absurd to think that the whole toxic masculinity thing is not connected to certain politics. And when tried to point it out it's like this Ryan George sketch where a company was using paper straws and a customer was like: They don't work. Answer was something like: Do you like to murder turtles? It's the same. Whenever you try to voice your opinion you are hit with something similar.  \nCould it even be that some of the men in the world don't share that view point or even have their own views or politics? Basically pushing a political agenda on men. And If you disagree you are sexist.\n\n  \n**Wrong bet**\n\n  \nMaybe I'm wrong. But the way many people would view this is connected to my point above. They decided to be against men. Take a side, support an argument, and basically align themselves with political view that is against men. Fair enough. Don't anger and demonize your audience and expect them to buy your products. That's just absurd. And here where people are correct in saying it's insincere and hypercritical. Not as the main cause but as one of many. We all know Gillette don't give a shit about anything but profits, heck I think that's fine. But don't run ads saying: Men are bad, we are against men. Now you men should buy our products. Smh\n\n  \n**Please note**\n\n  \nThe context of this is also vital. To make things crystal clear it's the whole timing and context that made it bad. They jumped the band wagon. Sadly it was one that opposes men. So. Even if you think everything those view points support is right. Fine. But the context was very negative to men. It's like how Hitler is not accepted anymore in most places, or that a Swastika tattoo is viewed as a Nazi symbol rather than a religious icon for other groups.   \nWhich is again about ignoring context and villainizing the opposing side. You can't claim good intentions or finer political points when you join the other side that is carrying a pretty big banner with bold letters that read: Men are bad and evil. Don't join that parade and wonder why men are not fans of your actions.   \nThere is so much more to stuff like this. And men are not stupid. They picked up on it. They felt insulted and attacked.

It\u2019s prevalent throughout much of human history and  behavior spanning every rung of society from any point in history. \n\nFor some, their conscience mind may yearn for the path of least resistance; and for others, they ardently struggle and wage wars upon themselves in search for scratching that itch of thrill and accomplishment. \n\nThe subconscious mind would be most akin to that of an addict. Upon overcoming a challenge, eating your favorite food or having a slumber party with that special someone- endorphins are released making you feel like a million bucks. Your brain loves releasing those chems but throughout the eras of human revolution, we\u2019ve evolved a rather complex emotional system. A carrot and stick approach is sort of what your... \u201cinternal life guide\u201d uses to have your conscious self go about it\u2019s routines and activities. It helps you learn what to and not to do. Your brain loves learning new things. You create more novel, tangible memories when you yourself complete a task rather than just playing Simon says under someone else\u2019s vade mecum . \n\nIt\u2019s much more rewarding, and as life is about the little things, to learn these things yourself and something you strive to do more frequently. That said, taking the easy route is nothing to look down upon either. We live in an era where there\u2019s more information readily available at your finger tips than you could possibly consume in a thousand life times. You shouldn\u2019t feel responsible for knowing everything via first hand experience, it\u2019s just simply not feasible.

The ultimate cost affects the corporation's bottom line, but no different from any other method.     \nI.e. In localities that GST/VAT applies, this is an end-user tax.  It doesn't affect a big corp's bottom line.  \n\n\nIt makes no sense to buy it form another supermarket as then they're paying 'retail' price (less sales tax).  \nThe two options are: record it against store expenditure or as store theft.\n\n  \nThe outcome depends on how the manager prefers to massage their numbers to corporate.",

So while we can 'Store Use' a roll of the customer towels in an emergency it is not something the bigwigs want us doing if we can help it because even at cost the good towels are more expensive. Also all store use items have to be accounted for on taxes and if the $$ amount is to high our company might get the evil eye from the IRS.

            "I will say the Bible is very vague and metaphorical in it\u2019s descriptions of heaven. Rather than describing a kind of \u201cparadise\u201d as we might think of it, where you are surrounded by pleasure and comfort, most biblical descriptions focus on a kind of general togetherness with God.",
            "Essentially its a recognition that there is purpose in your existence. To be flippant with your life is to reject the purpose that you were given. Also, the ideal of Christianity is to be self-sacrificial, that is, not to be so consumed by making your own experience as positive as possible. By opting out of your life you negate all the good that you could do during it, for the sake of skipping to the \"good\" part, which ought to be anathema for Christians who take their beliefs seriously.",
            "I am facing down pancreatic cancer. I have a less than 50/50 chance. Now that being said I took the \"Great Commission\" to heart since I was a young man. Now I have been given a chance to bring hope and love to others that are trapped in infusion chairs along with me. I've only had one person turn me away. Most of the patients and nurses (I've been told) look forward to my chemo days because I'm there for 6 hours. I don't preach. I usually talk about their feelings and hold hands. Some are scared, some are curious, but all are faced with their own mortality. We all have experation dates, some are known, most are not.\nThen we talk about who has the best spaghetti in town which usually degenerates into a friendly banter. These people love to laugh they just don't get much of a chance to.  \nI'd love to get to heaven in a hurry and see my new digs but my job is not done yet\n\nMatt 25:40",
            "\"For me to live is Christ, to die is gain.\" \n\nThere is a recognition within the Christian faith that death will solve every problem. However, the true purpose of the Christian faith is not to got to heaven, or win rewards in the afterlife (contrary to how it is popularly protrayed). Rather, the acceptance of salvation and forgiveness of sin simultaneously calls us to pursue Gods plan on this earth.\n\nThat is to say, our purpose as existing as Christians is not to find some paradise after we die, but to demonstrate the love of God to others here on this Earth. Once we die, thats it. We can no longer help lead those around us to salvation. So our life becomes about loving our neighbors and spreading the gospel, as well as growing closer to God.\n\nChristianity, at least within most Protestant theologies, is not about following a list of right and wrong behaviors. Its about living a life centered around a loving God who saved you. This is why the \"Suicide is a sin\" argument falls short in my opinion. It shifts the focus to heavenly rewards, and not the Earthly calling we have been assigned. We should behave the right way out of love and reverence for God, and not because \"its what we should do\".\n\nTL:DR; Once dead, Christians can no longer show the love of God to those around them.",
            "This is exactly what Paul talks about when he writes \"for me to live is Christ, but to die is gain.\" If he dies, cool! He gets to go to heaven and live in the glory of the Creator. If he doesn't die, cool! He gets to keep doing the evangelizing that Christ has called him to.",
            "Paul talks about this. I don\u2019t remember the exact scripture, but it\u2019s along the lines of \u201cI long to be at home with the Lord, but for your sake I remain here\u201d. We\u2019re meant to serve here on earth, help brothers and sisters and share knowledge with those who want to know God. Earth can have its joy, Heaven will be better, but it is more selfless to remain here until our work is finished.",
            "Because they see life as a gift from god, the afterlife is the cherry on top, but life in general is where your life's meaning derives itself from.",

            "Negligence of one's own life is usually frowned up upon and can lead to a sinful life, also one is urged to spread His word and be a steward to the earth. (But most people just focus on the suicide is technically murder so it's still bad)",

            "Bad reference I know, especially if you haven't played it, but I sort of see it like Nords wanting to go to Sovengaarde after death in Skyrim. But though reaching there is like a life (or rather an afterlife) of limitless pleasure, if a Nord just dies dishonorably or kills themselves, they aren't allowed entry. To first gain entry you must have proved your worth and lived a life worth remembering\n\nPS- That's the way I see, it neither am I a Christian nor do I have **any** religious beliefs (so no afterlife for me) so do take what I have said with a grain of salt.",
            "Some people have sort of scratched at the answer, but to be perfectly honest, Heaven isn\u2019t a place you go when you die. Heaven, as Christians know it, will be when God completely remakes Heaven and Earth for eternity. It hasn\u2019t happened yet. \n\nWhen we die, we go to this celestial waiting room basically until the time is right for Jesus to return and remake it all.",
            "We DO.\n\nBut, an averse reaction to death is natural.  It separates loved ones (in a pretty dramatic way, even if it's temporary on the grand scheme of everything), and even if it's amazing, there is an unknown element to it.  There are debates regarding what it'll look like, and anything unknown comes with an element of worry.  And honestly, even the strongest Christian is going to have moments of doubt.  Well, maybe not the strong*est* ... Paul had a pretty balanced idea of death.  \"To live is Christ.  To die is gain.\"  But anyone within a couple standard deviations of the average ...  It's not like Christians are perfect in their faith.\n\nAnd my pastor would argue that there's an instinctual aversion to death because it wasn't a part of God's plan for the universe.  It entered the universe with sin, so it's perfectly normal that we should be a bit shocked by it.  I find that a very interesting and somewhat compelling thought.  For me, though, the bigger explanation is the one I gave above.",
            "Everyone wants to go to heaven, but not today.",
            "u/TeaTurtleFriend put it pretty good. After accepting faith in Jesus Christ our lives no longer belong to us, we are now bond servants to due to Him sacrificing himself to pay for every bad thing we have done and will do, since even one unatoned sin is disserving of Hell and the cost to make up for it is death. Now, as His bond servants, we are charged with conducting His will, which is done by us just spreading His word (the Bible) throughout the Earth. Base level, that's just us reading the word and letting the Holy Spirit turn the hearts who He chooses to. (What that doesn't include is is the not-so-Holy Roman Empire spreading it through extreme violence). Those who hear the word and are moved by the Holy Spirit will find faith in Christ and be saved from Hell. Unfortunately good works mean nothing if you still have just on wrongdoing in your life. So, we are tasked with this till the Lord is done with our service, which is when we die.\n\nFor us to self terminate would not only be murder due to us destroying an image bearer of God, but it would also be denying God's sovereignty over our lives as his servants. But, as scripture says, To live is Christ, and to Die is Gain. We win no matter what, and even if we die, we still get the ultimate prize on the other side",

Because you gotta follow the rules to get yours.",
            "Here is my thought on it: First of all, I was given a mission to accomplish so I want to complete that before I go. That is the main reason.\n\nSecondly, I have no idea what Heaven is like. Sure, we have descriptions, but I don\u2019t think the human mind can ever truly understand what Heaven is like until we actually go. So, it\u2019s not like wanting to go to Hawaii or something lol. More than the place, I want to meet God and be in His presence. Even that I can\u2019t really fathom, but I just know it will be amazing because the only times I\u2019ve felt true peace in my life have been when I felt the Holy Spirit with me. \n\nA side note: When I was clinically depressed, it honestly felt like a physical detachment, but it also felt very strongly like complete and absolute separation from God, like there is no hope left anymore. It was really unsettling and scary, and I would describe that as how it feels to go to hell. It took me years to repair and rebuild my relationship with God, but now I am joyful and so blessed!",

            "It seems to have to do with the \"relational\" aspect of their God. The OT was pre-messiah, and post Revelations is the restored creation. To Christians, we live in the middle ground where heaven is a reality as in the relationship with God has been restored spiritually but it still has not been renewed physically. The task then, is for these Christians to share the good news with those who are still living without any relational or restorative aspect of Jesus's redeeming live/death/resurrection. To mature/informed Christians, the goal is not \"heaven\", but a communal relationship with God for eternity while they copartner with him in caring for creation.",
