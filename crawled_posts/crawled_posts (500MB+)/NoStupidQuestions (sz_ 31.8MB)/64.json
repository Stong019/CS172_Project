        "selftext": "Its a ridiculous situation im finding myself in right now. I was walking my dog when i saw a heated argument go down between a young boy and a young girl right infront of my apartment door. While my dog was taking a shit i heared her scream \u201elet me go!\u201c and stuff but he was holding both her hands hindering the girl from walking away. Then when he slept her in the face, i let a loud whistle off and yeld to let her go. He looked at me and said some profanities but didnt let her go. So i walked very close with my dog who happens to look a bit threatening, which scared him off and he stopped holding her. I asked the girl if she wants to walk with me a bit tonget away from him and she agreed. While we walked away, the kid yelled \u201ei\u2018ll remeber your face, i\u2019ll look for you and im gonna beat you the fuck up when i find you without your dog!\u201c \n\nWhile i walked the girl a few blocks away, i talked to her a bit. Both of them were 14 years old (!) and the kid is apparently a huge troublemaker and lives a few houses further. Apperntly comes from a very troubled family.\n\nWhen she felt safe and the dude was nowhere to see, i let her alone and went back home. But there he was, right infront of my door waiting. I, a 30yearold 1.9m big guy, didn\u2018t feel threatened and just smiled at him while i entered my home with my dog. He also smiling back at me, making gestures suggesting that he wants to beat me up like in a bad oldschool highschool movie with bullies. \n\nI laughed about it at first. But this happened yesterday and the kid is still infront of my door waiting for me everytime i go outside with my dog. Im not scraed to get hurt or anything, he is like 1.5m small and im a big guy. But i mean what am i supposed to do? I guess i go to prison if i defend myself against a 14 yearold, if he really wants a fight, right? I guess i could just leave the house with my dog to just keep him away. But what would be the best corse of action if it really would come to an encounter without my dog and he actually tries to attack me or smthn, before i manage to find out who his parents are?\n\nTl;dr: 14 yearold kid camps my apartment door to beat me up. And i, a 30yearold big guy, would like to deescalate without going to prison.",

            "There's not a single reason, rather a few different ones that drive the boxed cereals. One is that the production machinery s set up to fill boxes, changing all/most of the production machinery is a big expense and a big delay in product supply and sales while the change is being done.\n\nBoxes protect the product from damage in manufacturing, shipping, and display while also being easy to design for efficient and rugged shipping and warehousing packaging.\n\nBoxes project brand name and advertising. They're like a series of small billboards with photos and slogans sitting on the shelf and hopefully enticing shoppers to a purchase.\n\nBoxes disguise the actual amount of product being purveyed. Visually a large box 3/4 full looks like a better buy than a smaller bag with the same amount of product.",
            "People tend to eat chips in 1 or 2 days. Cereal last a few more days and with the bag in the box it keeps it easier to put it back on your shelf. And u dont have to reseal the bag, just roll it up and close the box. I agree it\u2019s a waste.",
            "Some brands do, usually more of the organic, less-crap type brands, ime. \n\nI think it's probably mostly inertia -- it's how cereal is sold, it's how it's shelved - the shelving is different for chip bags vs. boxes, and at home people line them up in a cabinet... no one would want to be the first to jump.",
            "I was very surprised when me and my family immigrated to England from Poland because most of the cereal in Poland comes in plastic bags like crisps! It's a different plastic but same concept . So when I saw the cereal in cardboard boxes and THEN plastic as well my mind was very blown.",
            "Many places do, but they're generally the generic or 'store brands'. At some point, the continued packaging of cereal in boxes became the easy identifier of brand-name vs generic in US grocery stores, so no brand name wants to be lumped in with the generics.",
            "Oh you must\u2019ve not seen the cheaper cereal with no cardboard box.",
            "Then they would have to fill the bag with nitrogen (as they do with potato chips) to stop the cereal being crushed into powder while in transit. This would result in a much bigger bag and increased cost. The box protects the bag. It also offers advertising and various other revenue raising opportunities.",
            "Boxes are easier to ship in pallets than bags. They ship potato chip bags in bigger boxes.  \n\n\nIt is really down to that. Boxes are easier to fill with standard machinery, and easier to ship on pallets.",
            "It's probably because the cardboard box basically says that it is a premium brand cereal while the ones that are in just a bag are considered \"off brand\". It's all about the marketing. The ones in just bags don't care about the brand as much as they care about the cost.",

            "They do, it's just almost always a \"generic\" or \"off\"brand. Big name brand companies want their product to seem superior, thus a more appealing cardboard box is going to be their marketing strategy instead of just the bag, which can make it seem lower quality.\n\nIt's all in the marketing mate.\n\nEdit:I did once find a giant bag of cinnamon toast crunch in a sam's club. It was like 6lbs so just in a bag with a resealable zipper. So I mean big names still do sometimes I guess, since it's just more feasible if you're going to put that much in one package.",
            "They actually do.  It's in the bulk section.",
            "As someone that used to work for a litho-laminate box manufacturing company, it likely has more to do with ability to ship units. We used to perform crush tests all the time to determine how heavily we could load pallets without risk to the product. You can probably ship more units per pallet without damage to the product if they\u2019re boxed. Not to mention the colorful, easily displayed and stored box doesn\u2019t hurt to incentivize purchases.",
            "Most of the time its for shelf space, more shelf space and bright colours you occupy in the supermarket the more people buy you. A good example is colgate toothpaste, they have like 50 different kinds of toothpaste on the shelf simply so they are clearly visible,no one needs 50 kinds of toothpaste.",
            "Because it is easier to ship boxes than bags which also still need additional supports around it to prevent crushing or damage. You would be surprised how many marketing/packaging decisions are made based off shipping costs. I learned all this through shipping larger industrial tools and furniture (okay and a few estate lots of baseball cards for my SO each in excess of 500lbs.)",

I think the main reason it's not done on a bigger scale is that a good chunk of cereal sales are based on branding.  A cardboard box is a pretty good billboard.",

Apparently he, and the entire state of Iowa, love me very much. The next day his mother called me to tell me that her son's had crashed on her living room floor (despite the fact that they both had guest beds there).  The party that they went to was 2 hours walk from her house in a rural area with no taxis.

            "It's more complicated than many upvoted answers are making it out to be.\n\nPeople are different.  Some people hardly really find themselves attracted to anyone besides their SO when they're in a relationship, and for them, alcohol changes nothing, because they're still only attracted to their SO when they're drunk.  Other people do find themselves attracted to others, and simply use self control to not cheat.  For them, substances such as alcohol or xanax which directly reduce self-control could cause them to cheat when they otherwise wouldn't.\n\nIn this latter case, it's not a question of alcohol making them suddenly desire the person, but alcohol making them act on the desire when they wouldn't otherwise.\n\nI think it's useful to look at other scenarios where the morals of a relationship aren't at play.  Most of us know someone who gets angry and/or violent when drunk, though they are slow to anger and violence when they're sober.  If they get in a fight when drunk, we know that alcohol played a major role.  At that point, the question becomes whether they were fully aware that alcohol causes this behavior in them.\n\nTL;DR: I think many answers here are overly reductive.  People are different and alcohol can cause certain people to cheat who wouldn't have cheated in the same situation were they sober.",
            "The one time I cheated I was drunk. My girlfriend at the time and I were having problems. First serious gf I've had. Incompatible but when you're young you don't like to loose anything remotely stable. We would fight, make up, make love, then repeat. After a while it was just fighting. \n\n22nd birthday came around and we were arguing something simple. Don't even remember what it was about. Told her it was my birthday and I was foing to have a drink with the boys. Nasty words were said on both sides and I left with every intention of blacking out for the first time. \n\nI remember my friends buying me beer after beer and lost count of the shots. I do remember the girl thinking she was cute but not talking to her. Fast forward to the morning and I wake up naked in a place I dont recognize with a girl next to me. Condom was still half way on. There was no doubt I had cheated but I dont remember in the slightest even speaking with this girl. \n\nGot my things and went to my gf straight away and told her what happened. The guilt I had was real. I never knew up till then that guilt can be painful as heartbreak. We fought and I basically became a whipping boy for six months till I realized the relationship was over before the cheating.\n\nI guess what I'm getting at is that I had no intention of cheating. Honest to God. I didnt walk into the bar looking for a new lover or to be hateful. But my inhibitions were lowered and I really believe I just wanted to feel someone wanting me like I wanted someone. Doesn't excuse what I did. I carried that guilt for a long time. If you're unhappy with your partner then be honest with yourself. Itll save you a lot of heartache.",

            "You're going to find a ton of idealistic responses here based on peoples perceptions and how they want things to be, as well as a strong desire not to let people off for their misdeeds. The truth is that yes alcohol effects behavior and could cause you to make mistakes you normally wouldn't.\n\nAlcohol is actually an interesting substance, because it effects everything, including your judgement. People on alcohol are shortsighted and unsophisticated. Normally, if I saw someone I was mad at, I'd stay cool (don't want to come off like a hot head or burn bridges). If I saw someone I was attracted to I'd think \"they look nice\", but I'm taken.\n\nOn alcohol you're not going to be capable of processing that kind of information as well. You just know whats in front of you and base emotions. So I'm not going to think about looking like a hot head, or burning bridges, I will yell at you and/or physically fight you if I'm mad. If I see someone attractive, I'll just try having sex with them.\n\nI'm not addressing the case of whether it's possible to not know you're in a relationship. I think this is usually used as a cover or someone is a victim of sex assault. It would be possible to be so out of it that your relationship didn't even enter the equation. I think it's even plausible that you think you're having sex with your partner. This is why alcohol and consent don't mix.\n\nHaving seen a fair amount of heavy alcohol use there's very little that would surprise me. I've wandered back covered in blood and couldn't explain what's happened to me. I've seen others and personally experienced low level hallucinations and seen some really interesting stuff at the extreme ends of use. Pretty much any level of confusion is possible with alcohol.",
            "I think booze has a different effect on different people. If you have it in you to cheat, or say something racist, or steal, or fight...booze will make you more likely to do it.

I have never once gotten drunk and challenged someone to a fight. But i think we all know clowns that as soon as they get drunk, they get a little fighty. I think we\u2019ve all heard or read of someone saying something racist then passing it off like they didn\u2019t mean it, they were drunk. No, more likely it means they\u2019re just closeted racists. \n\nSpecifically relates to cheating on a partner...I would say it\u2019s the same except there\u2019s always a chance someone gets drunk and they don\u2019t see it as cheating, cuz they already felt like shit was on the rocks anyways.

            "So here's my opinion on the matter. Until I was in my 20's I always thought that getting blackout drunk was a myth. Just something people said when they did something they regretted. I had been pretty drunk before, and I had even had times where I was like man I can't believe I did that. I figured it was just one of those things. Then I got blackout drunk. \n\nI went to a party at my brother's house. I had bought a bottle of Amaretto, and it came with a glass kind like a bourbon glass. And we also got a 5th of tequila. Him and I decided we would start the night by using the Amaretto glass to shoot the tequila. We both took 2 shots of that glass full. I don't remember anything else after that. I have a couple flashes of small moment, maybe equating to about 2 minutes total throughout the whole night. \n\nI didn't cheat, but I think that's because I'm very unlikely to anyway. It's just not who I am, and never has been. That being said, I could have done anything outside of those 2 minutes, and I wouldn't have a clue. If my willpower were gone, I wouldn't know it. Was I more susceptible to suggestion? Who knows? I don't. I think it's pretty likely that if someone were a person that would be somewhat likely to cheat, and they got drunk in that way, maybe they would. And there is a very good chance they wouldn't even know they did it. If the person is someone more loyal in relationships like me (I'm not here to shit on people who aren't. It's just how I am) then maybe not. But my guess would be that anything is possible.",

It's kinda murky territory how much moral autonomy and responsibility a drunk person has. You've gotten ask questions like how drunk did they intend to be before starting to drink, is their level of intoxication in line with what had reason to expect sober, and how much responsibility does a now sober person have for very bad decisions they were partly but not fully responsible for. It's actually really complicated, and a lot of what's being said are just good rules of thumb.\n\nHow I like to approach it is to avoid being a hypocrite. imagine how you'd feel if someone did that to you and how you'd react to them drunk cheating, and that's probably the standard you should hold for your own behavior.  If you can't live up to that standard, you need to change what you expect of others.\n\nThere's one really glaring hole with that logic and it's that you shouldn't expect other people to be okay with you drunk cheating just because youre cool with them drunk cheating.  Anyway, my point is that if you can't help but drunk-cheat youre a hypocrite to be pissed if your partner does.  If youre not cool with your partner drunk cheating, you better not do it.  \n\nIt's fucking complicated.  Two people aren't perfectly equal and you shouldn't expect total fairness so that's not even a perfect way of judging what's permissible.   You gotta have some way of figuring it out though and I think with relationships fairness is one of the more practical ways of measuring what's okay.",

So we all stumbled back to (we'll call her X) house and got on the booze, she only lived like a 10 minute walk away. Long story short everyone got shit faced and gradually started to leave.

I don't remember going to bed at all, but that's what X told me the next morning. I'm not getting in her bed for sexy times or anything, the thought hasn't even crossed my mind all night (from what I can remember at least). We've been working together for years and are friends but definitely not in that way.\n\nI wake up at who knows what time and I'm somewhere in the middle or early stages of sexy times, not entirely sure how we got there but here we are. I half remember just rolling away and falling on the floor. I woke up at some unknown point and it seems we're fucking, but idk whats going on I just wanna go sleep. Then it's morning (or well afternoon) and I wake up naked except for my socks like oh my fucking god what did I do. X fills me in on the details, apologises for it and we go on our way.\n\nNow, I just cheated on my girl, got like 10 messages from her like where u at? I made some pretty stupid decision's, I should have gone home earlier (way earlier), I definitely shouldn't have got in her bed (I genuinely wasn't going for sexy times, I just passed out there). \n\nTold my gf we had a fight, couple years later were married. I don't drink like that anymore unless there's someone sober with me that I trust.\n\nSo yeah, 100% my fault but all the people here laughing like 'oh I fell over and my dick accidently penetrated someone' clearly don't understand that yeah, you can pass out and your dick ends up in someone.",

            "So in my experience its always just been a ruse to the real reason. I dont believe there is accidentally taking your clothes off and actively staying hard/wet to have sx, and in reality, when people do have sx it (ideally) lasts long enough that your mind wanders, so you're \"sober\" enough to be able to handle your clothes, body, and mind all in the wake of acting out on sx. My partner cheated on me while he was drunk and for a while used that excuse to keep my emotions at bay, but i realized that he would have had to of been contentious enough to pull it out of his underwear and pants, her to pull her pants down, him to stay hard and go for it, and them to actively seek someplace comfortable. Now, he stopped half way through because he got soft. Had he not, though, he would have continued. Leading me to believe this was intentional. And it was. His real reasom was because we were fighting amd angry with eachother at the time(not a good excuse but it was his truth). There were too many intentional factors at play and too many actions done at once to deem him not drunk enough to handle his body. There was no \"i physically could not stop\", or no \"i was so drunk i dont remember doing that, or why i did it\" because he was sober enough to handle undressing, getting dressed, having sx, and being clear enough he knew to stop when he got soft.\n\nThere isnt any reason or excuse that could defend not being sober enough to not know what youre doing. If youre too drunk you cant do anything. Your inhibitors are compromised but you still know right from wrong, and his experience taught me that no matter how much you drink, unless you black out/pass out, you know what youre doing and you can control yourself.",

Alcohol makes you think less things over. It's basically impulsivity in liquid form.\n\nAll that being said it's not an accident. You still chose to cheat even if you're drunk, you just drank something that changes your thought process from \"I feel like doing that, but I should stop and think about it\" to \"I feel like doing that, so I will\" It's still you just with thought processes you knowingly altered by getting drunk.",

We see the trope of \"You looked at another woman therefore you're unfaithful\" played out in fiction all the time and what do we think of the girlfriend in those situations? Or even the stories where the woman goes all jelly legged because that hot-celebrity spoke to them, while the Boyfriend sits silently next to her.\n\nSo, if we can accept that people in relationships will look at another person as a potential partner, and also accept that alcohol suppresses inhibitions, we can absolutely accept that cheating while drunk is a result of the alcohol and not necessarily a reflection on the persons general faithfulness.\n\n**HOWEVER**\n\nThat doesn't mean the victim in that occasion should accept it as done and stay with that person. How justifiable \"I was drunk\" is as an excuse is entirely up to the victim. At the end of the day, all relationships have to have a level of trust and no matter the reason, cheating can and will erode that trust. But what should be remembered is that getting drunk in the first place is usually a conscious decision. How excusable is it when the person does it multiple times then?\n\nOn a personal note, I've pissed people off while drunk and made dumb mistakes. Not cheated on someone though but I still cringe at my actions. So now I make sure to not get that drunk again. If you think you might do something stupid as a result of alcohol, the solution is simply to not have that much alcohol. But nobody can predict the future so mistakes and accidents can happen. In my case I've been forgiven for most of mine because the people affected generally accept that I'm not the same person when I'm drunk.",
            "100% lie, just used as an excuse to justify cheating ...",
            "I can assure you that,  as a guy,  if I'm blotto enough to not know I'm cheating,  my physical ability to cheat would have been DOA long ago.",
            "I quit drinking years ago but I used to be drunk every weekend, with or without my current girlfriend, and to the best of my knowledge I can't remember ever cheating while drunk before. I'm not sure if it's because the opportunity just never presented itself when I was drunk, or if I had the opportunity and just didn't act on it. \n\nI've cheated completely sober and I know I put myself in that situation with the intention of cheating. She was an athletic red head with blue/green heterochromia. I don't think that the Dalai Lama could've resisted that. \n\nThe environment I was in when I was in a relationship and drinking wasn't usually the same environment I'd be in when I was single and drinking so that's probably why. \n\n\n\"Give a Fucks\" go out the window when drunk though",
            "Even if it gets me downvoted, I disagree with the prevailing opinion in the comments. 'They must somehow want it,' statements freak me out because I feel like rape culture feeds off of them-especially when you throw alcohol at that fire.",
            "It's a \"justification\" people use as a way to absolve themselves of their actions. If one is drinking and can't maintain control over themself, that's their problem, not anyone else's.",
            "You know I always thought when people said they were drunk and you can\u2019t blame them yes you can blame them because they 1) put themselves in the situation to cheat and 2) just control yo horny ass and if you really wanna cheat fam break up with them first, better to break up with them and then do it rather than have them find out and then get super sad and get broken up with regardless , which leaves you alone with yo cheating ass and the person that was just looking for that 1 nights stand",
            "No one accidentally cheats.  It's always a series of choices where one person decides to put their own personal gratification over their relationship.  \n\nAlcohol lowers inhibitions, it won't make you do something that wasn't already in your head to begin with.",
            "I haven't gotten drunk in a long time, but I think it varies from person to person. I happen to be a very very loving and horny drunk. I promise, I'm not proud of it. It makes me very ashamed and that's why I don't drink anymore. So I think it would be possible for some people who are like me who just act that way when they're extremely intoxicated. Usually I'm only like that if I'm blackout drunk though. But I've heard so many horror stories about me throwing myself at everyone in the room, while falling down drunk. So I would say that it is possible. In my defense, though, I usually don't remember when I'm in that state. So, I think it is possible, though some people might just use it as an excuse.",
            "\"Drunk actions are sober thoughts\"\n\nI don't think alcohol makes people cheat, but it gives them an excuse as it makes you feel braver/more risky.",
            "It's absolutely justification. I have been supremely trashed, I've smoked 2 bowls, snorted two vicodin and drank half a handle of fireball and there wasn't anything I did that I didn't already want to do"

Generally, the more skill or knowledge a job requires, the more freedom you'll have.\n\nThe bulk of the money that banks make comes from loans and investment products.

Banks in Poland are heavily digitised (pretty much space tech compared to German or USA standards), so there's barely ever a reason to be there physically - what can't be clicked through in e-banking can be done over the phone.

I've had worse commutes at other jobs but, still, commute and travel time is just a waste (and contributes to stress!!). Before COVID, if one of my kids was sick, I was supposed pick them up from school within 1/2 hour. This was a bit open-ended but, working even 20 mins away and accounting for traffic and weather it got awfully tight on time.\n\nAt another job I'd work overnight (11pm - 2am...if lucky) then get told \"our hours are 9-6, you need to be here\" (not 9-5 because we got an hour for lunch). I would routinely work weekends and holidays. Was given random deadlines. Didn't have a chance to see a therapist. Had an hour commute each way (at least).

            "I don't know if this would be considered under law enforcement, but in the case of a suicide, or if someone dies of natural causes in a house, police officers are called in to investigate if there's any foul play. The fucked part of the whole procedure is that the officers will collect enough evidence and then leave. It's on the owner's behalf to clean up the body, and most of the times it's the body of relative, loved one, etc. There are companies devoted to clean up the body, and since it's America, a lot of suicides are gun related with a lot of splatter and matter that just can't be washed away. It's just terrible just hearing about families who need to grieve but now also have to seek out professional, third party, services to clean up the crime scene.\n\nAlso, a more murky territory, in the case that officers do an intense search (breaking down the door, tear gas, and all), normally it's upon the homeowner to deal with the mess. That's when home owner's insurance comes in, but again, the people getting their homes raided by the police are not in the best financial position to say the least. They're left with their homes wrecked by the police search, and paying out of pocket for broken windows, doors, and tear gas removal (it's a thing and tear gas sticks to carpet for months). \n\nBasically, in America, if you screw up just once, you get caught in an endless cycle of debt and punishment. Driving under the influence? $10,000 minimum and suspension of your license. Now you can't drive to work. You need to pay for bail, and getting your car back from the impound lot. You get reprimanded at work for being late, so you drive on a suspended license out of desperation. If you get pulled over by the cops, and now you are facing a misdemeanor, and further jail time.  \n\nPolice officers in America don't necessarily strong arm you for any bribes. It's not like in any \"developing\" country with a corrupt police force that looks the other way if you have enough cash on hand. The legal system just slowly bleeds you out of any money and soon it just becomes a cycle of debt and punishment that begins with the police force.",

You pay for the police in that your tax money goes toward them in part, but there\u2019s not a police *fee* of any kind. It\u2019s not a one-to-one thing where you personally pay for whatever issue police are solving for you. Your taxes are used, like all other taxpaying Americans, to fund the police. Regrettably.",

            "No, public/municipal police forces don't charge for their service like healthcare providers and such. They are, however, funded by taxpayer money so technically yes, but Im pretty sure thats how it is anywhere else in the world. They're government employees so they're paychecks come from government budgets which comes from taxes, same for firefighters, public libriaries, state/federal Departments of Transportation, Departments of Health, education and things of the like. The thing with American healthcare is that there simply isn't any government ran/funded healthcare providers except for basic basic things. Most hospitals, doctor's offices, clinics, etc. are privately owned and operated, therefore they charge those using thier services directly to continue operating, additionally this allows them to charge whatever they want for whatever services/medications they provide, since its not regulated by the government. And the reason we haven't changed that is because if the government funded and ran healthcare, a select few (hospital CEOs, pharmaceutical execs, insurance companies) wouldn't make as much money. So they spend a lot of money to get shithole lawyers (lobbyists) to pander to legislation and keep healthcare private so they can keep making more money. But, no. Your common, everyday police department doesn't charge individuals for specific services.\n\nEDIT: I'll also add that there can be fines and charges for abusing or misusing police/firefighter services however that's not a payment for service rather a penance for wasting time and resources (i.e. other taxpayers' money). And there ARE private investigators, security forces and even private militaries but those are luxuries that aren't typically necessary, they also exisit in most developed countries, not just the US.",
            "As far as I'm aware, under normal circumstances no. If you make a false claim you may be charged a misdemeanor offense and pay the city for the wasted resources, but that only applies if it was done intentionally. So saying something was stolen and it turns out you gave it away or sold it would be something where this may apply. I saw earlier you were asking if it would apply if a child disappeared for awhile and the parents files a missing persons report, but this would not count. The child didn't do it intentionally, and the parents had a valid concern, even if the child was only a block or two away with a friend.",
            "Yes and no. \n\nPolice are paid for by taxpayer money (either at the local or county level). If you need to call them, they're not gonna give you an invoice.",
            "If you are ever convicted of a crime you may have to pay costs of investigation/prosecution/court. The criminal justice system is funded not just through taxpayers but also largely through fines/fees imposed on folks who are given traffic tickets or accused of crimes. \n\nBut if you\u2019re a victim reporting a crime, you generally don\u2019t have to pay anything beyond normal taxes for them to investigate.",
            "America doesn't have shared standards.  Generally municipal taxes cover the cost of public safety and fire fighters, but if you lied or set the fire, you are fined or billed depending on where you live, after you go to jail.  Generalizing living conditions in America is hard to do.  It's more like 50 little countries with hundreds of smaller countries doing what works best for their own communities (or whatever apathy allows to work).

We already are a somewhat socialist country. I pay school taxes in my property tax but I don\u2019t have kids. Why should I pay for other people\u2019s kids? Because it\u2019s good for everyone to have an education. People who disregard caution signs and have to be rescued may be charged as well they should. Their disregard of signs puts first responders lives in jeopardy. Like people who drive around low water crossings in the middle of heavy rains.",
            "Jesus Christ, I know some of America's reputation for being expensive is warranted, but we're not that bad.  In general, the police provide their services at no cost, regardless of what it costs them.  The times I've heard of police charging for their services is if they're providing security for some kind of private event such as a street fair put on by a business improvement district, or if they were forced to waste money by being purposefully misinformed.  The second case is pretty rare.  In general, as long as you're calling the police about a matter of law or life and death, and you're being honest with them, you don't need to worry about getting a bill.",

            "As an American, I feel surprised that we dont have to pay for police services. Cause yknow, America is America",
            "No. Police just keep the things you reported lost or stolen as payment, just like they did with my case because they needed it for conviction of a trial forever.",
            "In America, you don't have to pay for ambulances or Healthcare if you are over a certain age or you don't make enough money (or you're a veteran of the military). We DO have public-funded Healthcare, even if it's not great; it's just reserved for people that are deemed as needing the most help, and it only covers the costs of things you are deemed to \"need,\" not just whatever you might want. \n\nAlso, no matter who you are, they will never refuse to send an ambulance or turn you away from an emergency room. Everhone gets lifesaving Healthcare. They'll try to bill you for it later, but if you don't make much money then there isn't a lot they can do to get that money from you. You can't be sent to jail for debts (only for unpaid childcare or taxes). The biggest problem is that people have to wait until something is life-threatening instead of getting easier and cheaper preventative care."

Before I got there, he was anxious, stressed, coughing and gasping for every breath. I had no idea, when I got there, he was so calm with me, and never coughed once.

I agree with others, wait a couple of weeks, sift through pictures and think about him often. \n\nI personally had my girl cremated, kept a tuft of her hair in a jar and had a portrait made of her. The portrait was pricy but when I look at her I remember her so vividly and my heart fills. I did wait about a month before commissioning it, and it is on my wall above a bookshelf, along with her favorite things and ashes. \n\nLosing your best friend is the worst part of the wonderful life we have with our pets. I know you will do the right thing for you to memorialize your special, unforgettable time together.",

I find it best to wait on any big purchases after unexpected life changing events. This is not the time for impulse based purchases.\n\nSo I would say: Give yourself a couple of weeks. Hug a pillow for now.  Then return to the idea and make your choice then.",

I thought about getting a clone plushie but i think it wouldve made it harder. My partner and son wanted a dog and after 5 years we got a new dog a month ago. I think if i got that plushie it would be impossible to get rid of it. I think it would become baggage. Instead I have his remnants and a jar with some fur that I found stuck on an old brush. \n\nAlso, it helps to call out to your dog like he is listening.

Sadly I had to put him down last year, but had him privately cremated.

The plushies are great quality and 2 look exactly like the actual dogs and the other 2 are pretty close.

The last time I saw her conscious was when I handed her to a vet tech at the animal ER, and now I wish I\u2019d asked to come back there with him to keep her company.

If you\u2019re less *sad* and more just kinda *empty* about it - you feel the absence more than the loss - then get the plushie; it won\u2019t quite fill that void but it\u2019ll probably help a little.",

If seeing a plushy that looks like your bb makes you happy, I say go for it.\n\nI\u2019m so so very sorry for your loss.",

I would not so why then do this to an animal?\n\nEach to their own, but I find taxidermy just cringe to see, especially if it's a pet, can understand hunters doing it for trophies.\nBut overall stuffed carcases are not nice in my opinion, leave the pooch to rest R.I.P.",
            "I have socks with my dog's face on them so I don't think getting a stuffed animal would be weird.",
            "First of all, I'm so sorry for your loss. I don't think it's weird to get a plushie toy of your dog, but you might want to think about this before purchasing it. I know that people find it really really hard just after they've lost their pet and perhaps might not always make the best decisions. For some people, looking at a plushie of their pet might be more painful than anything else. But everyone grieves in a different way. Having this plushie sounds like something really sweet and something that can potentially help you deal with the pain. So either way, do what you feel is right.",
            "We all grieve in different ways. I think thats totally up to you if youd like it, and you think it will help. Then it cant hurt.\n\nIm sorry you lost your dog :(",
            "Not weird. Sounds nice actually. I remember my dog, running out. Fireworks and all. I'll spare the details, but I found her on the freeway. My dog, Archie, once ran away. Gladly found him safe and sound at a pound. He's safe now, with good people",
            "My heart goes out to you \ud83d\udc94\n\nMake sure when you have grieved to consider giving all that love your dog was lucky to have to a rescue dog. I know it's tough now but you clearly have much love to give.",

            "Dogs, unlike people, will love you unconditionally. They are always there for you at the end of the day and always happy to see you. The phrase \u201cmans best friend\u201d couldn\u2019t be more on point.\nGet the stuffed animal, and put one of their collars on it, maybe keep one of his/her toys with it. \nIf it were me, and if your considering cremation, I would put a container with the remains in the stuffed animal",

            "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s weird. No one should tell you how to spend hour money. If doing this brings you joy and comfort, I say do it.",

            "No. I have a cremated dog box and to this day it has his collar on it and I touch it. Always makes me feel better when I miss him.",
            "Do it",
            "Do what feels right to you. If you want that plushie, get it, what do you feel? Don't ask us. Never let anything feeling weird stop you if it makes you feel good. Within reason and law of course lol.",
            "Do it. I've been wanting one of my dog that passed when I was 20 ever since. It's 100% worth the money in my opinion to have that sense of comfort when you hold it and hug it.",
            "You don't need to apologise, in the UK we would call a plushie a stuffed animal too, I knew exactly what you meant from the title. I'm so sorry for your loss, lost two of my dogs last year, it hurts like hell, but you get better at dealing with it in time",
            "Yeah, that's way too much. You could get one on wish.com for like 40 bucks.",

            "Don't. \n\nLoss is a part of life. Allow yourself to feel sadness. Mourn. \n\nIt will help you heal and move on. Your memories will live on, but the wound left by the loss will close.\n\nIf you have a permanent reminder it may be temporary comfort but it will prolong your grief.\n\nMy condolences and best wishes to you OP",
            "Not weird at all, we all grieve in our own ways and if it helps you heal to have a plushie of your dog then that's nobodys business but yours.  Give yourself a little time before making a decision, it's an expensive memento.  I paid \u00a3320 for a photorealistic tattoo of my cat after she passed, absolutely no regrets, but I did give myself 6 months to decide if I actually wanted to go through with it.  \n\nThere's lots of ways to honour a lost pet that are cheaper and just as lovely.\nYou could plant a tree or a shrub and have a little plaque made to put by it.  Have your favourite photo of them printed and framed.  Write a poem in their memory.  Display their favourite toys or accessories.  \n\nI am deeply sorry for your loss I'm glad you were there for his final moments, that would have been a great comfort to him.  You've done an incredible service by donating his body to science, that will help a lot of fellow dogs and owners.",
            "For the record, I just understood you to mean a plushie, as I also call plushies 'stuffed animals'. \n\nAnd no, it wouldn't be weird. My cat has started to display signs of epilepsy, and your post has me thinking about doing the same thing once she passes. \n\nIs there a specific place you would go to get the plushie made?",
            "Yes, but do it anyway.  You're allowed to be weird if you want to do so.",
            "I was also thinking of getting a lifelike plushie but decided against it because I thought my extended family would judge me. We asked my mother in law if she wanted one for her dog that passed but she wasn't into it.  It is a totally personal choice do what you feel will help.",
            "No! We all grieve differently and if your coping of loss is aided by a having a plush  replica of your best friend you should absolutely get one (if you can afford it easily). My wife and I contemplated doing the same and then having it as a plush for our son when he is born. We are saddened that he will never know our old dog. He was such an amazing dog. I am sorry for your loss. It does get better with time, but man does it suck nonetheless.",
            "I think you mean something like Cuddle Clones. The problem that I see is that while some of the clones are excellent likenesses, some are simply awful. If you can trust the manufacturer, do it. It can be a lovely tribute to a lost friend.",
            "If you can afford it, yeah I\u2019d do it. You wouldn\u2019t question it if you didn\u2019t really want to. Grief is a bitch and pets can be our best friends sometimes. Do whatever helps remember him in a positive way",
            "Do it",
            "A regular stuffed toy? No more weird than a somewhat large picture of said dog. Just be careful if you get a new dog that it may want to play with the stuffed toy. 300 is an expensive chew toy.",
            "mementos are not weird, 300 is a lot for one, but if you think its worth the cash fee free. \n\nI personally just keep the collars of my passed dogs.",
            "No, if it helps you get through it.   I suggest waiting a could weeks though.  Maybe try making a monument or remembrance art piece out of some of his favorite toys in the meantime?  Very sorry for your loss.",
            "A plush stuffed animal, hell nah that\u2019s not weird. The sewing body thing is but just a stuff animal is not weird",
            "Weird? No. But i would probably just say to take some time to process and remember your pet before deciding. Ask close friends or family for ideas to commemorate his memory and you may find something else that you prefer. I will say it does sound like a great idea tho, and one i would probably look at myself when the time came.",
            "...my only advice is do what you feel will help you; unless its an at home taxidermy kit type thing, don't do that kit that lady did where she didn't put a \"shell\" underneath and made a nightmare kit. \n\nIf you're getting something in his memory, don't do an at home version, don't just go with the first place without seeing their actual work. Make sure you get a nice, quality stuffed animal in his honor.",
            "No, I heard South Korea does dog cloning but it costs 100k or so",
            "no, def worth it",

            "Yes- that\u2019s weird",
            "No don\u2019t do it. Losing loved ones is part of life and as hard as it may sound for now, those lost loved ones would eventually be replaced and that is perfectly normal.",

            "Listen here, Norman bates",
            "Yeah it\u2019s weird. I\u2019d give it some time. If you\u2019re really serious about it after a few weeks then go for it. But be rational. A stuffie won\u2019t replace your dog.",
            "yes",
            "Yes.",
            "If it hasn\u2019t been too long you could always save the 300 and just eat part of him that way a piece of your dog will always be with you?",
            "Yeah it would be weird.  Sorry if i have to say it.  It would make some people think y ou probably had more going on with your dog other than platonic.",
            "Not weird at all, I'd do it of my dogs.",
            "Grief work consists mainly in expressing and discharging anger (safely, like pounding a pillow, crying in a pillow). and afterwards you spend as much money as your budget allows. My monthly pnsion is exactly 300 USD - in the ex Soviet Zone - so obviously I must find other tools in such a case to \"console\" my inner child, so to speak. It might be okay BTW, who can judge this?",

            "I have one of these. I went through shelter pups, it was 100% worth it and I love it. It's very comforting. I have it of my girl that passed in 2009 and I still adore it.  \n\n\nI'm so sorry for your loss, it's really hard being there and feeling it happening but you absolutely did the right thing by your friend. I'm gonna go cuddle the crap out of my dog now.",
            "Not at all.",
            "It\u2019s not odd at all. I contemplated doing the same when my cat died but seeing pictures is still hard so maybe at a future point I will. I have seen some utterly horrendous ones though so look around at the work theyve made. The last thing you want to unbox is a botched imitation of your pup. Im so sorry for your loss.",
            "Do you mean cuddle clones?    I say go for it! Their dogs always seem to come out soo well \n\nWe did that when my kitty died. And it looks terrible. It\u2019s still in a box in my closet.  But I still follow the account and see so many good ones and the dogs always look a lot more accurate! \nAnd while it may not have worked out for me. They really did try.  They got the tail wrapped around her like she always did and they even embroidered her name onto the tag.    It\u2019s so sweet. \n\nHonestly just do it! \nWe also got little pillows made up with her picture on it and a picture of her sleeping on a blanket so she\u2019d still be sleeping with me.  \nDo whatever you have to do!!",
            "Is it weird? Yeah a miniscule tiny little bit. Who cares? Do what makes you happy. We're all weird, some of us just have the balls to show it.\n\nI'm sure this sounds weird, but your lil buddy is still right there with you and all he wants is all he ever wanted... for you to be happy",
            "Before my dog died I got an ikea husky. It doesn't quite look like my girl but its a husky. I said when my dog died, husky would be renamed to Shadow. Shadow died and husky is still husky. It just felt wrong to name the soft toy after my girl. It wasn't her.",

I\u2019d be willing to bet that the stuffed animal will bring you more joy than $300 seeing as you can afford it. \n\nI hate to think of losing one of my kids (dogs) but If I did, I can imagine having something like this would really make me happy and probably help with the grieving process. \n\nMy other dogs would rip it to shreds but se la vie, I love to watch them play anyway.",
            "If you think it will help with grief, then it's not weird. We all grieve differently. I joke with my bf that I'll get him taxidermied if he died because I won't be able to move on haha. But in all seriousness you should consider whether it'll help you cope or it'll just be a painful reminder that keeps you stuck in the past. Everyone is different, so I'm in no way suggesting that it's unhealthy. If it'll help you deal with it, then go for it",
            "I'm sorry for your loss.\n\nMy last dog had to be put down hastily due to a rapidly worsening condition with his lungs filling with fluid as well, so I really understand your pain.\n\nNo, there's nothing weird about it. If someone claims otherwise, it's not their place to judge.",

            "Fuck no. I had my girl 18 years. Been gone a little over 2 years. Her ashes are by my bed. Something to remind/ remeber, nothing wrong with that. Start sleeping with it every night, maybe.",
            "No its not weird. Whatever helps you with the mourning. I lost my dog of 16 years one month ago and I cried a week before it got better. Wish you well!",
            "Probably not a good idea, you'll keep remembering your dog from it and be constantly upset as your plushie will keep reminding you of that dog, you gotta move on man.",
            "Will it bring you comfort and help you in your grief? Who cares if it's weird if it's good for you.",
            "Yes, grieving is not fabrication of a physical model of the deceased one. \n\nImagine a grieving mother introducing you to the dead daughter doll\u2026\n\nDeath is natural and for you to become a better person, you need to learn to face the pain and go through the process.\n\nTalk with someone, anyone, you can even call a stranger on mental health helplines. There\u2019s zero shame to that, on the contrary.",

            "I hand-stitched a small, felt, stuffed animal of my pup for my daughter before the pup died. Now that she's gone, I just love having it around. It's not something I snuggle with or talk to or anything, just a visual representation of her, and the love I poured into having her with me. I'd recommend going smaller than life size, just for the ease of storing and cleaning it. That way you can see the plush when you'd like and not have a dog-sized object in the middle of your living room. I am so so sorry for your loss. It's really difficult to lose a beloved pet.",

            "Not weird at all. I\u2019d probably do it. Currently cuddling my cat because your story made me so sad and needed to hold her tight for a minute. \n\nIt sounds like he was also calmed by your presence, and I\u2019m grateful you were there for him. \n\nI am so sorry for your loss, may his memory be a blessing.",

I argued that it\u2019s better if I just take a full day of rest, and come back fine the next day.\n\nLong story short, they made me go. The doctor told me to stay home for over a month. Couldn\u2019t stop laughing after I told my boss.\n\nEDIT: To those asking, I had over 200 hours of maxed out unused PTO so I was paid.

            "This is a copy of a note I recieved from a local doctor.  This was given to my employer and I posted a copy in the lunch room.  They no longer ask for doctors notes. \n\n\"Dear Employer,\n\nAn employee of your company recently visited my office to obtain a sick note to satisfy your company's absenteeism policy. Medical sick notes are NOT an insured service in British Columbia, and are not funded by (MSP) Medical Services Plan\n\nAs a taxpayer, and prominent business owner, I am asking for your support in helping alleviate an unnecessary pressure on our health care system. Kindly consider reviewing your absenteeism policy and removing the requirement for your employees to obtain a medical sick note for days missed due to illness. An increasing number of employers are requesting notes to verify workdays missed due to illness. This policy creates an unnecessary burden on an already overburdened health care system and exposes seriously ill patients in my office to infections that could be detrimental to their health and wellbeing. In most cases the best remedy for patients with cold and flu like symptoms is to stay home and rest. Visiting a doctor's office for a medical note does not complement their recovery, and may put other people at great risk.\n\nIf, however, your business continues to require verification of absenteeism from a physician, I will require a written request from your organization requesting the medical note. For the service provided, I will be invoicing your company $35.00 per medical note, as this is a standard practice when providing non medical necessary services for third party organizations.\n\nWe are very fortunate to live in a country with socialized healthy care, but the ability to access its services in a timely fashion is a growing problem. We all have a role to play to ensure sustainability. I hope your business will consider reviewing its absenteeism policy and continue to contribute to reducing the unnecessary burden on our health care system and improve access for other British Columbians.\"\n\n\nThis was scanned using OCR.

It's best if the user waits until they're all done popping by listening to when they stop popping and stops the microwave. Using the popcorn button can lead to more unpopped kernels if it doesn't give enough time or burnt popcorn if it's on too long. The microwave can't listen to the popcorn; they just detect humidity.\n\nSo, either side loses if they're the one to back down, so neither does and thus the constant battle between microwave makers who insist their device has a dozen functions, including a specialized one for making popcorn, and the popcorn makers who will tell you that you'll get optimal results if you don't use that button.\n\nEdit: I don't know why they don't just add some kind of microphone, but probably because it would make the microwave more expensive, but it wouldn't translate into more sales to offset the costs.",
            "I use my popcorn button for popcorn. Though I stop it before it times all the way down (about 10 seconds left) because the popping stops before the cycle is finished.\n\nLess time to press one button than to type in how long I want.",
            "Lotsa bad info here. The **real** reason is because, when popcorn buttons were first created, a bag of microwave popcorn was standardized at 3.5 ounces. Over time, the [Grocery Shrink Ray\u2122](https://consumerist.com/2014/10/08/the-grocery-shrink-ray-quietly-stealing-our-food-for-decades) has cut their size to 3.3 ounces or even 3.1 ounces. There are also 2.7 ounce bags, usually sold as \"snack size\" or \"100 calorie size\" bags. \n\nIn any case, microwave manufacturers haven't always updated the programming for the button, so if you put a 3.1 ounce bag in a microwave and press a POPCORN button designed for 3.5 ounce bag, it'll burn. Which is why microwave popcorn companies tell you to not use the button.\n\nAs a couple others have noted, some microwaves have options for this. On my microwave you can keep pressing the POPCORN button to rotate through various bag sizes: 3.5 ounce, 3.3 ounce, 3.1 ounce, 2.7 ounce, etc. And it hasn't burned anything yet!",

            "So there's two types of popcorn functions. One that just cooks the popcorn for a certain amount of time across the board usually dependent on the size of the bag which you enter. These are not great and tend to burn or undercook the popcorn. The fancier kind use a steam sensor to detect when the bag has popped open and is producing steam. These are better but still aren't perfect. However the popcorn manufacturer doesn't know what kind of microwave you have so it's easier for them to say \"These are how we got best results, do it this way or we can't promise anything\" and so you can't sue them when your popcorn button catches your microwave on fire. [Technology Connections on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiS27feX8o0) has a video about microwaves where I think they talk about the steam sensors.",

This can even vary depending on the variety of popcorn used.\n\nI think these buttons are provided for the people who want the simplicity of a convenience store microwave - find the button that most closely matches what you're cooking and push it.

That part should be obvious. \n\nThere are still microwaves out there from the 70s that still work and have a mechanical switch to turn the damn thing on. My parents have a microwave so old that I literally cannot find a photo of another like it anywhere online. Aside from the lack of a turntable it gets the job done. It also doesn't have a low power mode. So if you want to heat something then let it cool you have to do that yourself. \n\nI kinda hate that damn thing but it works and it doesn't make ear piercing shrieks every time you touch it like the $70 microwave I have.",

Daydreaming in school wasnt bad to start with but my 3rd, 4th and final year in High School was a blur. I hated school and always did, but being around other hormonal teenagers and fantasizing over the girls I fancied meant I couldn't concentrate on what I was doing.\n\nFast forward until my adult life, although I'm very happy compared to my old life, my brain has created alternative universes to keep itself occupied. This has worsened to the point of struggling with concentration and focus. It's why I've always been rubbish in jobs, I'm too slow, unorganised and woefully poor at planning ahead.\n\nI want to work on it, I wanna learn how to drive and you CANNOT daydream whilst driving, that's just as dangerous as using a phone.\n\nMy imagination, although comes from a creative side of me, is a relic of a long lost past in my life and I no longer need to \"escape\", I really want to be in the moment as this kind of thing means I'm fairly numb to joy and excitement also.\n\nSomething I'll need to work on, self awareness and concentration must improve.",

Last year, he flatlined during a routine surgery. they were able to bring him back but my mom was a wreck and I was able to calm her down because I had played a scenarios like this out in my head. It also work the one time I had a gun pulled on me I was Apprenticing as a bounty hunter in the South where I live and some guy thought we were trespassing or trying to break into his house.

Sometimes these would last for days and in the end I learned how to control my dreams to continue on with them. I also was able to pull up images in my mind while I paced this way. \nI learned later on when I finally went to therapy that this is actually called Maladaptive daydreaming. I was unhappy with my life, didn\u2019t have any friends and honestly just wanted to escape. It\u2019s really sad that at one point in my life my only friends were in my mind. The really fucked up thing is that I truly believed these events were real at one point, so I found myself talking about it like it actually happened.

            "You have a gift, not a childish handicap. There is very little negative associated with day dreaming. It's actually good for you. \n\nThere is science behind it too. It's called the task negative mode. Or default mode network. That is to say the brain isnt actually one thing. It's almost multiple organs networked together. You have a part for memory, a part for emotion, a part for facts, a part for anxiety, a part for hunger etc. \n\nWhen you have no task to focus on, your brain will active the default mode network. The simplest way to explain it is, the multiple parts of the brain start to talk to each other and share information. \n\nIt is also where the concept of the self comes from. If you are re thinking about yourself this network is likely activating. Thinking about others it activates. Remembering the past. The network is how we can work out what another person is thinking for example. Theory of mind is a very high level concept, the ability to work out what another person knows without speaking to them. \n\nDaydreaming is a sign if this network being active. These positive day dreams are not pointless, they are your brain exploring, creating, looking for patterns and models. Simulating the world. \n\nIt's also linked to some negative stuff. Some theories this is where anxiety and depression originate. When the brain has no task it day dreams, but does so negatively. That you do it positively is great.\n\nIt's also linked to creativity. Stories activate this network. \n\nYou have a good brain. Enjoy it.",

Sometimes, when during the day I think of an outrageous idea that I especially like, I put the thought aside to 'use' before I go to sleep. It take me awhile to finish reading books and articles and even Reddit threads because every new idea I come across makes me daydream about it.",

            "I am the same. \n\nI have a pretty great life, but I spend quite a lot of it in what I think of as \"the Dreaming\". When I daydream, I think I actually go into a semi-conscious state, so it's more like lucid dreaming in a rem state. I can feel textures, heat, gravity, experience smells and taste. This is only When I'm immobile, of course. When I'm driving or working, it's mostly what you mention re: running simulations to figure out how I'd approach different scenarios.",
            "That's me basically 24/7 with the two exceptions - when I'm asleep, and when I'm flicking the bean.\n\nIt has become somewhat of a problem for me sometimes, thankfully not as often as before, because my mind would start wandering while I'm driving. What helped me combat that is me telling myself that I'm practicing to be a rally driver, or am in a rally race simulator. It has also helped my overall posture while behind the wheel, and the different way I've learned to hold my steering wheel has drastically improved my trip and stability (damn old Subaru's).\n\nIn any case, I don't feel it has anything to do with a childish mindset. \nPersonally, I feel that this is just a way for some of us to escape our boring, maybe stressful lives and become a part of a type of \"action movie\" that we may feel we lack in life. Perhaps it's to also a way for us to have an \"escape\" plan in case a situation like that occurs, while giving us something engaging to get lost in. Our bodies and minds are weird. \nMaybe I'm wrong, but have you noticed that in the scenarios you create, like gunman encounter or rooftop collapse, you always come out alive and still if not for the most part unscathed?",

In my case it\u2019s definitely maladaptive daydreaming leftover from my shitty childhood. I guess it can be a form of disassociation. When I was in high school it took up hours of my day. \n\nAnymore I just do it while I\u2019m driving or to help myself fall asleep.",

            "Constantly. I thought it was super normal too up until about a year ago when I started randomly asking my best friends what they were thinking of. I invented a game called BANG to play with them too, which was pretty simple. Every time one of us said BANG the other person had to reply with exactly what they were thinking about, regardless of what it was. You could say it as often as you\u2019d like and whenever you\u2019d like. \nThey sucked at it and would often times say \u2018I don\u2019t remember agh\u2019. Very plain people with limited imaginations. One of them was so logical about stuff to the extent that she had to be right about EVERYTHING ALL THE TIME... we aren\u2019t friends anymore. \n\nFast forward a few weeks and my workmates and I (servers) decide to play after I was explaining it to them, providing that we had a rule in place - any time you said BANG you would keep it between the two of you and never tell anyone else what was said. If you called BANG in front of another person you\u2019d simply hold that thought as a little IOU until you could say it in private. \n\n Some were super creative, all were absolutely filthy. Turns out a lot of us want to bang each other.",

            "I\u2019ve thought about how as a child I didn\u2019t have very many friends outside of groups I would go to once a week, and I was homeschooled. On my breaks I would ride my scooter mindlessly down the street dreaming up people and cool ideas for stories. This hasn\u2019t stopped in almost ten years. \n\nIt might be some ADD in me, because I find it hard to do repetitive tasks in school. I get high grades but am so super bored on boring things but when when I am excited about a project I put my all and have a lot of fun. Weird.",
            "A friend of mine does it often. I try to do it more to raise my creativity and to kill boredom. Until a few weeks ago I only did it taking to myself when I'm alone but recently I started doing it also in my mind when people are around.",

I went and had therapy, it was the best thing I ever did, they told me I had ADHD. \n\nThe therapist said keep busy, exercise (I run 5km three times a week) and meditate which I'm bad at. I found having an outdoors job helped. I guess these things might not help everyone.",
            "Absolutely. Maybe its because I'm also into writing stories, but I always have a few recurring ones I'm writing in my head that I try to get onto paper. Sometimes that's the only thing getting me through long work/school days, I couldnt imagine never daydreaming at all.",
            "Is that daydreaming? I thought daydreaming has to be done with eyes closed. I make scenarios all the time while walking, making food, attending an event, sometimes even during a meeting. Like, I consider the joints on the sidewalk as lava and jumping over them is the only way to reach the destination. While making food, I visualize the food falling and smearing onto the floor with few portions getting stuck to my shoes and I can't wash it off........ have I been a daydreamer without realizing that?",
            "I'm in the same boat! OP, you should channel this into writing. I started a journal because I get these random daydreams that feel like a piece of a story. I've got a bunch of random ideas written down that I eventually plan to make into a novel.",
            "Kind of, i day dream but it\u2019s mainly reliving recent memories of thing I have seen or heard about. I have adhd so these day dreams are actually invasive. One minute I\u2019m working, the next I\u2019m staring off into space remembering some random Reddit thread I was commenting on or maybe what I saw on tv last night. It sometimes feels like real dreams because I do it at night too, but it helps me go to sleep because the imagery I see doesn\u2019t change only gets clearer as I fall in to real sleep. I can have some pretty wild dreams though, but usually heavily influenced by a recent piece of entertainment.",

I often use it as a method of escaping and I conjure up world where either I live as a different person and experience all of the things that I wish I had done or having all of my shortcomings be their strength. I often think really clearly about the details of this character\u2019s life and even incorporate real world events into the life of that character and having accuracy makes the fantasy a little more enjoyable. I also often think about if I could go back in time and relive my life and make different decisions and treat people better and that would help me avoid my catharsis and essentially give me a second chance but at the end of the day it is just thoughts that likely distract me from my real life.  I feel that this may not be the healthiest thing for me even though it gives me comfort and enjoyment in the moment.

I've had a similar thing my whole life, and at first I just thought it was a childhood thing that I never grew out of, but now I'm a young adult and realised that it's just part of how my brain works. I'm constantly dreaming up stories in my head, imagining scenarios either realistic or completely fictitious. I imagine in the way you'd see a movie or tv show, in scenes and storylines and specific shots. I've never heard of anyone else who was like this (I never talk about this to anyone myself) so it's kind of really nice to know that I'm not alone. This was always something I got pretty embarrassed about now that I'm older, just because I feel like it's childish and something I should've grown out of already.\n\nFor me this especially happens when I'm listening to music, does anyone else have that?

Its sucked for my grades and making friends at times but I think I'm a more creative person for it at times. I've actually always wanted to get involved in film and tv because of it.

            "I remember when I was a kid and my dad pranked me like this. I was heartbroken and disappointed and feeling like I put in so much work to get the candy, then put a lot of trust in him when he was \u201cinspecting it for anything dangerous\u201d. But I immediately accepted the fact, said \u201cthat\u2019s okay\u201d even though I was obviously crying, and politely excused myself to my room to break down.  **Heres what I don\u2019t get** - looking back on it, it didn\u2019t seem strange to anyone that a kids reaction to the loss of something important to them at the hands of someone they trusted was to keep all their emotions bottles up, plaster on a fake smile, then only cry in private? **That doesn\u2019t strike someone as a behavior pattern of an abused child???**\n\nEDIT: It\u2019s just a horrible thing to do that seems like it\u2019s not that bad, but can really mess up your kid if those kinds of things happen often. This brought up another memory of what must\u2019ve been like my 10th birthday. We always went to the same restaurant for our birthdays because the staff sang a special song. I went to the bathroom after we ordered, and when I got back my mom told me that the singing guys came, but since I wasn\u2019t there, they left and I missed them and too bad. I barely held in my sobs for the entire meal, I was so heartbroken. Of course they came back during dessert and everything worked out well.

            "It\u2019s supposed to be about the virtue of forgiveness, and the value of sharing, and just generally being a good-natured kid, but yeah, I think it\u2019s unfair and shouldn\u2019t be expected from a child.",
            "This is a fucked up practice and I will never understand how intentionally causing a child emotional distress is funny. They're going to flip the fuck out!!! They think you stole from them, and can tell you're amused by it; all that tells your children is that they can't trust you and that their emotional pain entertains you. \n\nI think it boils down to the fact that a lot of people invalidate children's emotions because they get upset over things adults find insignificant. And for some reason, find that funny? I don't see how a screaming child is funny at all, but apparently some parents are just sadistic. \n\nAnd honestly, who *wouldn't* be pissed about someone eating all their Halloween candy?",
            "Honestly I'm with you on this one. Is a child not allowed to be upset that something they were excited about has been taken away from them? Especially by someone they should be able to trust. Or are children not allowed to express being upset through the medium of crying about it? Either of these expectations is unreasonable for a child, the former is unreasonable for anyone. Plus whether or not it's actually a big deal practically speaking, the point of it is to cause the child emotional distress for the parent to get their jollies from. If you derive joy from watching your child experience emotional suffering of *any* magnitude then you are a shit parent. I don't care if you think it toughens them up, you should not revel in the suffering of your own kid just for its own sake\n\nEDIT: also regarding the argument that they need to learn to forgive people. No. They should not learn to forgive people off hand. They should learn that forgiveness is something that has to be earned. If someone is clearly deriving joy from watching you suffer from something they did to you then you should not forgive them. They need to admit fault, apologise and try to make amends, and even then, you should only forgive them if you genuinely feel that they have atoned for what they did. Forgiveness is not something you get just because the wrongdoing is in the past",

He didn\u2019t mean to scare them\n\nMy issue with this prank is that the GOAL is to upset them and make them cry and make them throw a tantrum because, being in on the joke, the parents think it\u2019s funny.

How do you determine when they\u2019re old enough to be \u201cworthy\u201d of respect and how can you ensure that you won\u2019t revert back to how you used to treat them all these years? Those parents are the same ones that will complain that their kids don\u2019t talk to them when they brought it on themselves. \n\nThere\u2019s a lot of people here saying it\u2019s about the virtue of sharing but if a grown ass adult stole your car and said \u201cwhy are you angry? You should be sharing with your friends!\u201d You bet your ass they would get a good cussing out. Adults are expected to ask before taking something so why can\u2019t you do the same for the kids? \n\nMy parents always asked if they can eat  something from my Halloween bag if I was home and if they grabbed something while I was in school, they would tell me in the car and offer to replace it on the way back home. My friends would have to hide their bags from their family to prevent it from being ransacked in a week and I was honestly really surprised to hear that. \n\nKids are people too and you have to respect them for them to respect you.

            "Some other people in the comments here summed it up well by saying that it's actually a red flag for the child to just politely accept it, but society expects children to act like either miniature adults or dolls, so the \"polite\" response is praised. It's a red flag because most kids who are generally treated well and fairly would be shocked and upset to be betrayed by their parents that way. Expressing disappointment or even anger over it is healthy because it's not normal to be expected to fake a smile in the face of injustice. Kids who just say \"it's okay!\" are more likely to be used to that sort of parental behavior (and therefore will not be as shocked or upset) and more likely to be expected to respond well when their parents are unfair or cruel to them (and therefore will automatically say it's okay and refrain from showing any negative emotion about it).",

            ">but when parents outright lie to their kids, telling them they stole their children\u2019s property, the kids are *not* supposed to ask for their property back?\n\nThe problem is that a lot of parents don\u2019t see their kids as having any property. The child sees their toys/sweets/ect as theirs, but the parent doesn\u2019t see it that way. They see everything the child owns as belonging to them, the parent, because \u201cI bought it!\u201d, and even if they didn\u2019t buy it themselves they feel entitled to it because \u201cI am the parent and you are the child.\u201d Therefore, the parent feels they can do whatever they want with their child\u2019s property and the child isn\u2019t allowed to say anything about it. It\u2019s this weird thing where parents seem to see their children as inferior to them because they\u2019re younger, so the parent sees everything the child owns as belonging to them because they don\u2019t see children as being capable of owning anything. It\u2019s super shitty. \n\nThey also tend to downplay it because of this. If you told them they stole, they\u2019d just say \u201cdon\u2019t be ridiculous, it\u2019s only my child! They understand. You\u2019re acting like I robbed a bank or something, haha, stop being so dramatic!\u201d\n\nIf one of these kids told their parents \u201cyou stole my property and I want it back\u201d, these parents would probably just laugh.\n\nA lot of parents also pay great attention to what they *verbally* teach their kids, but don\u2019t pay attention to what kind of behaviour they\u2019re actually modelling for their kids. These parents probably don\u2019t even realise that they\u2019re teaching their children a horrible lesson because they think that just saying \u201cstealing is wrong\u201d is enough. They may also potentially be \u201cdo as I say, not as I do\u201d types of parents.\n\nSomeone else said this further up the thread, but grown-ups often forget just how much power they hold over a child. They don\u2019t realise how little agency children have, and more importantly, I don\u2019t think they realise how *aware* children are of how little agency they have. \n\nI think some parents also don\u2019t realise that they can\u2019t expect a small child to react to something like an adult. If you pulled this prank on an adult, they might be mad, but they\u2019d see it for what it was, a stupid prank. But all a child sees is that their parent betrayed their trust. \n\nAnd of course, there are some rotten parents who just don\u2019t think very hard about their children\u2019s feelings, or don\u2019t consider that children have feelings just like adults do and aren\u2019t just props. They decide that it\u2019s okay to deliberately upset their child because it\u2019s \u201cfunny\u201d and gets them likes on social media. And then they rationalise it with \u201cwe told them the truth later!\u201d, \u201cit\u2019s to teach them a lesson\u201d, \u201cit was just a bit of fun!\u201d, ect.\n\nEDIT: Sorry for the essay, whoops.",

            "Well I think the kids that \"forgive\" their parents are praised because they aren't expected to do that.\n\nParents want to see how their children react. When their children respond unexpectedly with maturity, they are praised. \n\nWhile I get your point, I don't think that everything in life is a lesson in humanity. Parents are people too and will do things for amusement.",
            "Ask for their property back? Like, regurgitate? No. They'd have to find another away, and the forgiving kids may realize on some level their parents will make it up to them.\n\nI watched the most recent Kimmel video. It may be because the kids who were very quick to forgive did so right after the parents said 'sorry'. The reason that's praiseworthy is because we value absolving someone who shows guilt/admits wrongdoing. If we didn't do that for 'little things', tension would remain unresolved, which is unpleasant for everyone. You don't need to throw a tantrum when someone steals in order to express your disappointment and your expectation of reparations. With little kids, that may be a bit too socially complex. It would be up to the parents to say 'Sweetie, I'm sorry. How about we go see a movie and you can have all the popcorn and candy you want?\"",

            "First off, I think all pranks, including this one, are stupid and poor form.  Every prank is about \u201churting\u201d someone in some way, and I don\u2019t find them funny.\n\nI think it\u2019s more about the child\u2019s reaction than anything.\n\nA temper tantrum is never good conduct and a child is raised well, in my opinion, if they have a logical, rational reaction.\n\nIf they throw a fit, they are probably used to getting their way and they don\u2019t know how to deal with adversity.\n\nEither way, I think pranking and filming your kid to post on the internet is poor form from the parent, and it\u2019s not surprising that their kids generally react poorly",

            "Well then let me ask you, in what scenario is forgiveness of intentional wrongdoing appropriate? \n\nThe whole point of forgiveness is to look past a misdeed. It seems that you reject this principle axiomatically. You see understood offenses to be appropriately responded by the victim with the expectation of restoration. \n\nForgiveness does not imply that an act was ok, and is therefore compatible with the understanding of something being wrong. It is merely a personal choice to not hold that act against a person, while acknowledging it was wrong. \n\nIn fact, without that acknowledgement, it wouldn\u2019t be forgiveness. It would just be the absence of the perception of wrongdoing.",
            "Because they're teaching them how the hierarchy works.

            "My take: it\u2019s expected that a young child would have a temper tantrum/meltdown over being told their parents are all of their candy.

Wow!",
            "But how else are children supposed to learn not to delay gratification by waiting until later to enjoy their candy? If you don't teach them early they might end up spending below their means in some stupid attempt to enjoy their wealth later. You've got to teach them early that the world is a harsh and unpredictable place where you have to squeeze whatever joy out of it you can get before somebody steals all your shit and murders you in your sleep.",
            "They praise the kid a because they know their place. thus is not about teaching their kids to demand their property back. This is to know if the child is spoiled, entitled thinking they deserve everything or if the child know that the parent has ultimate authority.",

I didn\u2019t actually realize it was for an internment prank until a couple weeks later and then realized that they prolly wanted us to be throwing fits years later.  And thinking about it my reasoning for the double standard or stealing part is that as a child my things are mine because I use them but their not mine because  I bought it. And I see it as that since parents buy most of the things for their child they see it as their right to take it away. Sorry if this was more a ramble then an actual answer.",

            "I would say correct: it's good to not steal but it's also good to forgive people who steal from you",
            "As with most moral questions, it's more complicated than \"stealing is bad\".\n\nThe first point is the maturity of how they react. You can be hurt and upset without throwing a temper tantrum and by calmly expressing your feelings. Also, it's not like they can give back eaten candy.\n\nGenerally in the west, forgiveness is valued. Turn the other cheek, giving the shirt off your back, the prodigal son.",
            "I understand what you're saying, but a child having a temper tantrum is far from the same thing as a child asking for stolen property back. Having a temper tantrum for any reason is no way to respond. A child that is being raised properly should know how to deal with anger and unfortunate situations without acting like the world is ending.\nSo I do believe that a child that is at least forgiving a parent or thanking them for being honest about it is being raised a million times better than a child that has a panic attack over it.",
            "I completely recognize and agree with your point. Candy, however, is a treat in which the child has to have permission in the first place to eat. So, they get buttloads of candy, but can't eat it without asking first. The whole stealing 'prank' is just that. I don't think it screws with moral code or perception. It's not 'theirs' until they're allowed. As far as 'being raised right' is in point of not being possessive of petty objects, and knowing how to share. All and all I'm a little disappointed in myself for thinking this far into this topic in the first place. As should you.",

            "It sounds like a shitty thing to do to your kid.. but I\u2019m guessing those who react calmly vs having a meltdown probably have better self control and empathy. Although who could really  blame a kid for being devastated to find out their candy was gone? I wouldn\u2019t have had a tantrum as a kid but I probably would have been really sad and confused as to why my parents decided to eat it all and leave me none. It probably would have made me feel really disrespected and that\u2019s not cool to do to your kids. I do think I remember my dad probably joked about this before when I was younger but didn\u2019t draw it out and made sure to let me know they were kidding shortly after saying it. Probably because I looked at him all pitiful and asked why lol I certainly don\u2019t remember having a tantrum over it though and if I had I probably would have lost my candy rights based on the fact that I was out of control upset over candy and in my house as a kid we weren\u2019t allowed to have angry outbursts or talk back or pitch a fit because we wanted something. We were taught to communicate our wants and needs with discussion and mutual respect. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s fair to play that joke on your kid because I think that\u2019s irresponsible as a parent but I think that if you raise your kid right they would probably not have a bad reaction of pitching a fit and if they did react badly it would probably just be sad and you\u2019d feel bad for pranking them. Also, parents who do this and post it online are probably narcissists and shitty people anyway.",

            "It\u2019s kind of a sign of abuse. The kids are just so used to not getting their stuff that they just don\u2019t care. It\u2019s good to learn to forgive, but the ones who just don\u2019t care have been hurt before to the point where it just doesn\u2019t make a difference to them. I feel so sorry for them. They deserve the candy more than anyone else. Also all the love in the world because emotional abuse is the type that no one else can really see and this is one of the ways it can present itself.",
