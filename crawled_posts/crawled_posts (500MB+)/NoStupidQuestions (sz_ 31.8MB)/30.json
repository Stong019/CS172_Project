If it's under your shirt, people probably wouldn't notice.\n\nSomething to keep in mind is that jogging might not be the best activity right now for you. Running and jogging are high impact activities.

Yes, it\u2019s cheap and easy to get started but your knees and ankles will take a lot of damage - mine certainly did!\n\nFirst, you need to get your food under control. It is simply impossible to burn enough calories through exercise to lose a lot of weight. Once you get the food under control, start doing some weight training or other resistance training to tone up your muscles. Your weight might stop dropping because you\u2019re adding muscle but you will still see yourself getting more fit. \n\nOnce you\u2019ve been doing that for a while, add an aerobic routine, such as cycling, to get your cardio system fit as well.\n\nSource: Like I said, I used to weigh 310 pounds. 25 years later I weigh 190 - but I\u2019m suffering from bad knees and hips from my years of trying to jog.",

I believe in you!",
            "As a word of warning, depending on how much you weigh, it might be a good idea to start with walking instead of jogging. Long distance walking burns a lot of calories as well and is not nearly as damaging to your knees and joints as running.\n\nAlso, the best way to lose weight is simply to eat less. Exercise is important but you need *a lot* of it if you want it to be equal to, say, skipping a meal.",

For example, you burn the same amount of calories in a 5k run as found in a medium muffin. So jogging to lose weight is starting off on the wrong foot. Perhaps consult a dietitian and start a walking program first.",

            "Don't go running for losing weight. Check your food intake. Run because you love it and want to be able to run longer/harder. If you need to wear a bra or tape or whatever, just do it. You be you and do your thing!!\nStart with a nutrition (don't know if it's spelt like this).",

            "Don't focus too much on exercise. Almost all of your weight loss will come from a better diet. In fact you don't have to exercise even one bit to lose weight rapidly, so long as your diet is strictly controlled.\n\nI recommend exercise for other reasons. It will be marginally easier to keep the weight off if you live a more active lifestyle, and there are many, MANY physical and mental benefits.\n\nPlease don't start with jogging, you most likely aren't ready, and that's okay! Jogging is a high-impact activity and combines many muscle groups which, if you have been inactive for a long time, are likely atrophied. It will likely damage your joints. You should join a gym and start strength training, however you aren't going to build a ton of muscle if you are in the calorie deficit needed to lose weight.\n\nGenerally you gain muscle, or you lose weight. Doing both at the same time is difficult which is why you should deemphasize exercise. You will see much quicker gains once it's time to turn around and PUT ON weight. \n\nHowever, it is still worth it to exercise now! You will build some strength and it will help your mental health, however the most important thing will be improving your joint health, which is why I recommend strength training. Once you lose weight you will need strong joints to stand up to the impact force of jogging. I recommend using an elliptical machine or biking in the meantime. Combining low impact movement with strength training should be your goal. \n\nIf you ever get discouraged just remember your goal, that's all that matters. Being in top physical health feels better than you are even imagining, you will feel superhuman. If you think you would do anything for superpowers then good news, you truly can achieve them.

            "So bothe myself and many friends have gone through weight fluctuations and have been able to lose considerable amounts of weight within 6-24 month spans.\n\nI highly suggest NOT running or jogging to lose weight if you are currently large enough that you are considering a sports bra.\n\nOur knees are very fragile things.  When you jog or run, you are putting an inordinate amount of impact force on the knee.  The larger you are, the greater the impact force is.  If you are a large person and try to jog to lose weight, I'd bet even money that your knees will be injured before you lose weight in any meaningful amount.\n\nTHE SOLUTION:  buy a rowing machine.  There is no impact force on the knees and it burns calories at a MUCH faster rate than jogging or running (jogging really doesn't burn that many calories).  If you can't afford a rowing machine, most gyms have them, get a membership.\n\nI have a couple friends that are marathon runners, and who tend to get fairly (read:very) fat when they stop training or dieting for more than a year.  They swear by rowing machines, because they know running won't shed the pounds fast enough and will fuck up their knees so they can't race.\n\nBest of luck",
            "Wear whatever makes you feel comfortable and don't worry about what anyone thinks. If it's under a shirt it won't be very noticeable anyway. \n\nOthers are saying not to run because of the strain on your knees - I'd say that yes the extra weight does put you at higher risk, but if you really want to run and enjoy it, the most important thing is good shoes and good form. Do some research on form, go slow, and listen to your body.\n\nAs a lower impact full-body exercise, I highly recommend rowing. It's a really good complement to running as it strengthens all the muscles supporting your knees (as well as back, core, and arms!). Squats are good too.",
            "If only Seinfeld's \"bro\" or \"manzier\" existed.  But seriously if you think you need it go for it, but as others have said jogging might not be the best option.\n\nMost weight loss starts with food, cutting calories, keto, intermittent fasting are some things to consider.  Also, strength training will benefit you more. When you build more muscle your body naturally burns more calories even when you're not doing anything.\n\nI would consider doing a diet with strength training and mild cardio.",

Uneven ground gives extra benefit contra asphalt as it trains your balance and core musculature much better, and will have softer ground thus minimising joint impact.\n\nGoing to hard on your body at the start is the most common way for people to ruin their training, due to injury recovery breaking habit you worked hard to get started.\n\nIf weight loss is your goal I can highly recommend an app like lifesum and a gram scale that helps you calculate calorie intake.

If you are carrying excess weight to the point of considering a bra, jogging will be too high impact for your joints. Even biking, stationary bike would get your heart rate too high to yield noticeable results. \n\nStart with your diet. Don't cut carbs, Atkins, paleo, fad diets. Just start by eating less. Figure out your base metabolic rate (Google a calculator), and then eat 500 -1000 less calories a day.\n\nAfter that, I would walk. Walk for an hour a day. Then walk faster. Then walk more.

Like others mentioned, and coming from a guy most likely bigger than you, jogging is going to suck. If you can, swim. I eventually said \"fuck it\" and started swimming at the gym. It was tough because I was embarrassed about my looks, but damn it we all die some day anyway and I'm not going to worry about others thoughts. If not swimming, walking does wonders, less impact and all that. I'm lucky enough to live out in the country and happen to have other things I can do like splitting wood and using a scythe to mow down the high grass in the ditches and fields (harder than a bitch at times to be honest). Also, as silly as it sounds, I started doing VR, it really gets you moving and I noticed results from it alone.

            "Other people are talking high impact, and they're a bit right, however I know I don't like biking or swimming as much as running. Here's good advice for decreasing impact on your joints while running:\n\n1. Buy GOOD running shoes \nNot Nike or Adidas, but go to a specialty shoe store, they have brands like Saucony and other specialty running shoes. You can get a shoe that fits your foot perfectly with a good amount of cushion for your joints. \n\n2. Run on soft surfaces \nDirt/gravel/grass/rubberized running tracks are all soft surfaces that are low impact. Grass is best but the others are still good. If you need to run on the road, run on asphalt, not concrete. Concrete is the most brutal surface to run on period, avoid it as much as possible. \n\n3. Run correctly\nThere's a lot of heel-toe running in the distance running community, however landing on your heel sends a sharp impact up into your ankles and worse, your knees. Try to run on the balls of your feet. When you do this, your foot becomes like a spring and really reduces impact on your joints. You feet are made to flex for this reason! (However this will require a type of shoe, the shoe experts should be able to help when you explain you want to avoid running heel-toe)\n\n4. Stretch and ice\nThese are just great things to keep all your muscles and tendons working correctly and proper flexibility can help your joints. Ice when you're done a long run, 20min on, 20min off, 20 min on. Don't use a cold compress, use ice in a bad to really get around the joints (mainly the knees in this case).",

I also wore a sweat suit so I can sweat out as much as I could. I was always so scared to go to a gym until I was halfway through my goal of the loss. Luckily, not many have this opportunity but I do recommend it. Find an orchard, my grandparents owned one so every day I set myself a PR I would run down one isle. Their property had 35 isles maybe a quarter mile every 5 isles. I ran one until I couldn\u2019t anymore and the next day I\u2019ll add another isle and another until I was able to consistently go up and down and complete a full mile.\n\nEvery quarter mile I would stop, 10 reps of burpees, 10 sit ups (learned bicycle crunches after stamina built up) and 10 push ups. Then I\u2019d run the quarter mile back and repeat.\n\nI did this every day for 3 months and got down to 185-190 and still do this every morning. \n\nAll I can say is if it helps you achieve you, let people judge I gained a lot of confidence from their judgment and it never broke me.

I've just come in from playing out in the snow in the big front yard. It's nighttime and relaxing by the pellet stove sipping a hot cocoa with whipped cream. My husky, Raphael is behind me chewing on a bone. My grandma is cooking dinner. My papa is listening to the radio. It's a calm night.\n\n\nYeah...I long for a home that isnt around anymore.

            "Home is just a memory now. I felt most at home at my grandparents house. It was safe and warm, I felt truly loved there. There was an old swing set in the backyard, beautiful old trees lined the property. The house itself had many cool hiding spots and secret hallways that only a cat could fit through. \n\nMy parents had a falling out with them, we visited less and less over the years. My grandfather passed away, while we were helping my grandmother move out, it burnt down. Now it's just a plot of land with a single tall tree.",

I miss those days sometimes.",

The floor in the attic where me and my little sister slept was unfinished plywood so we could spend hours drawing little mini worlds, or making etchings in the dry wall chimney.  \n\nNow when I look at the house that used to be mine and I see the horrible ways that they have desecrated it, I wonder to myself if they even realize the significance of all the art they covered up and stripped away. Or to them was it just the ridiculousness of wayward children. \n\nAlso why would those cunts take out my attic window? \n\nAnyway... Home is now just a fantasy that lives in my mind because every place I\u2019ve ever lived in after that is just a place where I rest my head.

It's just empty windows and semi-abandoned cars everywhere. Several districts of the town have already been demolished, and the former center of the town is just a ghost town with empty display windows everywhere.\n\nIn just a few years the last remnants will be entirely evacuated and the last houses moved or demolished, due to the expanding mine underground.\n\nFrom 12000 inhabitants 30 years ago, to less than 1500 today, and of those most of them live in two outlying districts that likely will be unaffected by the mine. Basically *no one* lives in the city center anymore. The town is quite literally dead.  \n\nThere's no longer *anything* there that draws people, no stores, no offices, no business, no public utilities, *nothing*, heck even the once beautiful *park* is gone... The only exception is a high-school (where I also went) with 700 students from the nearby towns and villages, but it will be demolished as soon as the new school is finished in another town... probably next year.\n\n\nThe entire town will just be gone...

            "This feeling is called saudade in portuguese or sehnsucht in german. It's a difficult to define feeling of yearning for something that it's either not there anymore or was never there in the first place. This sort of feeling can be trigger by discovering an old photo you forgot of something you thought was one way but, once you see it again, ends up being completely different. It can also be felt towards something you wish you were part of but never were, like times you have never lived through or places you have never been to. It's different from nostalgia because nostalgia usually refers to ones memories of what was experienced. Saudade is usually triggered by a clash between crude memories and the fantasized narration that each one of us lives through day by day. It's a very slippery feeling to wrap your head around, but it's so cool and useful to be able to recognize it and name it.",

My parents are still there, but so many loved ones are gone, and so many others are ill and forever changed.\n\nIt tears me to pieces.",
            "That feeling is just anxiety\n\nOnce I was able to identify that, I was able to think, \"what is causing my anxiety?\" And then I was able to address the root of my feeling.\n\nChanged my whole life.",

            "Yes. It still exists but I'm in college now and it no longer truly feels like my home, and soon it'll likely be foreclosed and gone anyway.",
            "No, my life is better now. I was pretty badly abused early on, so it's nice being free to make my own way.",
            "I honestly never got homesick. Not at camp, not when I moved away to college. Had a great family life, but I was happy to be away and alone.",
            "No not really",
            "Home feels like a far off dream now. My mother died when I was 20 (over 20 years ago now), just before I went to university. I've never got on that well with father. \n\nHe still lives there. And while we're still (barely) in touch I've not visited the house since about six years ago. All my good memories of the place are tied up with my mother.\n\nI'm homesick for a place that only exists in my memories. So I can never go there.",

            "This is how I felt 8 years ago. I had finished undergrad and was living in a new city (away from most friends and family), in a dumpy apartment with a roommate who I barely knew. My parents, new empty nesters, had sold the house I grew up in and downsized (sold their house and bought a condo in the city and a cabin up north). My girlfriend lived in another city (the one we both grew up in) and with her (loving but sometimes suffocating) parents. There was really no place that felt like home and it really got me down.\n\nAnyway, let's jump ahead to 2019. That girlfriend is now my wife and we have a baby daughter. We've been in our apartment for 4 years and it feels like home. We've made friends who live in the area, know all the fun local hangs, gotten to know our neighbours, are getting to know the other parents nearby who frequent the community centre, etc.\n\nFor a while I didn't have a home, but my wife and I built one and it's great.",
            "Yep. Then you realize you need to build that sense of home with friends, new loved ones, community.",
            "I was constantly moved around alot, so when I become homesick I ache hard. Not ever knowing home or what a concrete life was like. Aching for the feeling of security instead of just a place i grew up. Home was a concept I never really got to experience.",
            "Yeah this happened to me. My parents retired and moved to a new city, brother left town. I left town too.\n\nI'm back in my hometown for a wedding and it's not really home anymore.\n\nFor me home is where my family is, I guess. We had moved around a lot before getting the house I grew up in. And it's gone again so back to how things were.",
            "No, and here's why.\n\nI was born in fairly small city just under 100,000 (about 70,000 when I was born). The first house I lived in was with my grandmother, uncle, and aunt, and of course my parents. My grandmother, uncle, and aunt are still alive (except my grandmother is not in good health) so I still visit them to this day. Can't remember much the time I lived there because I was only 4 months old when we moved to this deserty boiling hell called Arizona.",
            "Yes. I long for the summer holidays at my grandparents house. I have no family now and no place felt like home apart from that beautiful old house. Trashed and over modernised now, the hearts been ripped out of it. I can't wait to have my own home again. A place that can't be taken from me.",
            "\"Home\" is an idea.   Its familiarity is nostalgia for persons,  places,  friendly faces,  laughter,  identity, and a sense of belonging.   But life moves on,  people die,  things change while others stay the same.    \n\nYou can feel like you're a tourist in your hometown.\n\nI'd say it's normal to feel nostalgic for a past that no longer exists.   But keep in mind that the past you remember is only your past, and might not be the reality everybody else experienced.\n\n  Also examine why you might feel nostalgic.   Think about what you are actively missing, and pay attention that you don't live your whole life in the past.",
            "Home is as much a feeling and a memory as it is a place. My favorite Vonnegut quote (which I am about to butcher) is one where says that \u201chome is Indianapolis when I was nine years old, and I had a sister and a brother, a cat and a dog, a mother and a father, and aunts and uncles, and I can\u2019t get back there again.\u201d",

            "I don't necessarily feel homesick, but I don't feel like anywhere is \"home\". When I come back to my parents house my room is no longer my room and the house is a little different so the feeling really isn't there. Otherwise, I am back and forth between an apartment with my gf and an apartment for college. I'm sure it's mostly because I am not completely settled, but it's a weird feeling.",
            "Even as a kid I have this feeling constantly, I\u2019m only 15 but I watched my family get ripped apart, rebuilt with another women, then completely destroyed. Every time I\u2019m with my father I just cry, because I know my family can never have a home again. It\u2019s just a house with different people and I know that sounds confusing but it\u2019s just not home without your family.",
            "I have a tendency to get a strong feeling of \"I want to go home\" even though I have no desire to ever go back to any of the homes I've had before, because they all suck, and the \"home\" I want to go to wouldn't make me comfortable at all. It's like longing for some ideal concept of \"home\" that doesn't really exist.",

Most of the kids I knew there have either moved away long ago, or are still near me but their personality or relationship to me has changed so drastically that we could never be the same again. Both are very nearby to me but I could never feel the same again. Same applies to some of my family members.

Now that house has been empty for more than a decade and I have only been there for less than once a year because it is very far away from where I live. When I am there I get lonely because none of the people I used to spend time with in my home town are there anymore, it's a small town of about 2000 people and everyone I knew from there have either passed away or moved somewhere else and drifted apart.\n\nI miss home even though I really don't know where that would be but I know I will never have that, so I am trying my hardest to make a place like that for my son.",

Where I live was never my home, home is where you feel welcome; which for me is with my friends.",

Now I understand that \"home\" isn't so much a place as a feeling. \n\nThat dynamic is gone and it's not salvageable. They've all grown up and moved on. They expect me to be the same person I was when I left there 10 years ago and they are working the same deadend jobs and (still) living in their moms houses, now with the addition of kids. \n\nI'm not the party animal I was. I don't care to gossip about people we went to high school with and I'm not \"lucky\". Life is what you make it and I chose to make it elsewhere.

I feel strong nostalgia towards my childhood home and also the town I lived in in my 20s.\n\nBut that childhood home morphed into a trigger of all my insecurities and mom issues and a reminder that my dad passed away and another man lived there now. \n\nAnd the town I lived in in my 20s (Seattle in the early 90s) has changed so much, I hesitate to go back there because the idea of having a place that I felt was \u201cmine\u201d seeming foreign to me is too unsettling right now. I want to hold onto the Seattle I remember. \n\nI think I\u2019m more homesick for the comfort and safety I felt in those places at those times than for the places themselves. \n\nI want to be back in my childhood home, with the smell of AC running during a summer thunderstorm, when I still thought my parents were the best, I didn\u2019t have any other context to contrast my \u201cnormal\u201d, when I didn\u2019t have to think about the future and didn\u2019t have any residual trauma, anxiety, & guilt from the past. \n\nI want to go back to Seattle just post grunge, when we were excited to see the actors from Northern Exposure at a Sonics game, KNDD was the coolest station ever, I had the energy to go to live shows on weeknights, my friends & I were learning to be grown-ups but were still convinced we\u2019d never be \u201ctoo old\u201d to enjoy the stuff we enjoyed doing, friends were splurging on toys & expensive liquor using money from cashing in some of their stock options from their warehouse job at Amazon, housing was affordable...\n\nI really miss myself from before 9-11 and before my father died. I think both of those things changed my ability to trust that there was a certain threshold of \u201cthings are ok\u201d that I could depend on.

            "Companies doing this is what caused people to stop using/trusting email correspondence. Most people don't mind you sending them an email once a week. They will tolerate a promotion where you send them one email a day, but best practices has you have them opt-in to that kind of special promotion prior to being bombarded with that once a day frequency. \n\nThe top comment of this thread suggests that the reasoning is to place the company's name as \"Top of Mind\" for the recipient, but anyone that has ever studied the metrics of a mailing list knows sending your readers more than one email per day is the fastest way to kill your open rate. The ones that don't go ahead and unsubscribe will just ignore/archive. Once that reader has it established in their heads that your emails are spam, basically, you're in a really bad situation to gain their trust back and get them to start opening your emails, again. The worst part of all of this is when your readers start marking your mailings AS spam, instead of unsubscribing. When that starts to happen you will lose your sending reputation. If your company's spam ranking gets high enough your mailings will bypass the inbox altogether, sending your messages straight into your reader's junkmail box. \n\nIf your mailing list isn't opening your messages and reading them then what are you even doing?",
            "i'm a software engineer who worked in email marketing.\n\nthis is probably a bad process no one has looked at in a while. it probably started out, a few years ago, that when you'd sign up or buy something, they'd send you an email. it was great, people liked it. \n\ncut to a couple years later, corporate needs to see more growth and they think marketing is the way to do it. so let's add some more marketing emails to our flow, because we need to see 10% more growth this quarter. so we add another marketing email, this one gets sent 5 hours after your first purchase to maybe entice you back. okay, it's kind of loud getting an email right after purchase and one a little bit later, but it's not the worst thing in the world. plus we're hitting numbers and growing.\n\n8 months go by and growth has stopped. we need an uptick in numbers again. the last time we needed an uptick in numbers, we got huge gains with little cost by sending more emails. the executives mandate that marketing send another one. they don't care how marketing does it or what the experience is, they need to be able to report growth numbers.\n\nso marketing tries to add _another_ email. they don't have a choice, and they want their customers to like them, so they think real hard and try to send the most valuable email, wedged between the other two emails that have now been accumulating. it's not nearly as good as it was before, but the executives are off marketing's back.\n\n6 months have gone by. guess what. we need more growth. at this point, tim and jessica, the marketers who've been with B&N for the past 6 years are done and have had enough of being told to spam people so corporate can see more growth. they both leave to join startups where they can interact with their customers better. our marketing department is gutted and we need to market. hire someone and tell them to make growth happen.\n\nexperienced marketers see this situation and avoid it like the plague. b&n is forced to hire _anyone_ to make this shit happen, so they hire a dunce who isn't interested in customers or marketing or branding, but just wants to get a paycheck and advance his career. he kowtows to all of corporate's demands to just send more email, and we end up in a situation where B&N is in a tailspin and spams people multiple times a day. but hey, it looks like the numbers are going up.\n\nthe numbers go up, but it's temporary. to keep the numbers growing (the way they are expected to) they need to keep sending emails. chasing upticks in numbers is the reason that facebook and instagram are killing their long term viability. people are leaving the platforms because they're wising up to the fact that tech startups are chasing short term growth at the expense of long term good products.",

Then, it becomes clearer why internally people will focus on just achieving numbers rather than long-term meaningful goals.\n\nA marketer would place more weight on their reach than on the meaningfulness of that reach. They define a broad target consumer (e.g. anyone who visits the site) then proceed to barrage them with emails and robocalls. Then they can take the number of communications and brag to their leadershit team that they \"engaged Xm customers with a frequency of Y\".\n\nThis is another reason why they LOVE social media. It basically does their work for them. They just display the engagement figures through followers, likes and other metrics offered by social media.

If it pushes then far enough away, they'll find a local maximum, or an area where sending 1-2 less emails per day gets worse results, even if the absolute best they could do is actually 2-3 a week.\n\nDestruction by committee gets tempered by better testing, but you need to get that testing through the committee, so it's kind of a self defeating cycle, they ruin it, and then prevent themselves from improving it",

Viscous snot is definitely better at, well, being snot (keep in mind that the purpose of snot is to catch foreign bodies and prevent them from entering our lungs), but it can also cause blockages in the nose, and thus was not evolutionarily selected for in the animal kingdom - thus, we can see (for example) that dog snot is clear and liquid in a healthy dog.\n\nHowever, when primates evolved fingers for picking of fruits, swinging of branches and wringing of necks, they suddenly became able to *clear* blockages in their noses - and thus, noses wide as fingers and viscous snot were suddenly evolutionarily selected for, given that viscous snot is much better at blocking diseases.\n\nThe ability to pick one's nose allowed snot to become more viscous, which then in turn necessitated the ability to pick one's nose. Nose-picking, and therefore nostrils the same size as fingers, were thus evolutionarily selected for.",

I thought that it was some kind of a fine but I've never got fined before (been living in my house since 04), plus the envelope had no text or stamp on it. Opened it and found a weird note inside with a bunch of numbers written with pencil. I have no idea what this is about but the next house is like 100 meters away from mine so I don't think that somebody simply mixed up the addresses or the cars.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've heard that redditors are pretty good at solving these kinds of things but I don't know where to post this.

            "Edit 4: Wow, whoever gave me gold for this, I'm stunned man. Thank you so much!\n\n> ORIGINAL POST AS FOLLOWS -\n\nHey, I figured it out partially and I got chills man.\n\nIt's ASCII.\n\nAfter translating it, it reads:\n\n38 34 32 34 39 39 2e 37 38 2d 20 34 31 35 34 30 36 2e 36 33 20 67 61 62 20 64 65 72 20 61 20 6e 69 u r alone now dont come after me\n\nDo these numbers mean anything to you?\n\nMan, I got the CHILLS.\n\nIt would help if you could tell us where you live (country) or if there's anything near you. Maybe figure out what the significance of these numbers are. Also it feels like there's someone who thinks that you are after THEM. So maybe it's got to do with where you park every day, or a place you pass by regularly, and someone recognizes your car?\n\nEDIT: (compiling data) (clarifications)\n\nThe string of numbers then translates to \"842499.78- 415406.63 gab der a ni\"\nwhich reads 'in a red bag 36.064514 -87.994248' backwards (Thanks, u/Nrutasnz)\n\nThe coordinates point to the middle of Tibet, China. A place which is impossible to Google Map due to the restrictions on data. Might have to use Bai Du or something.\n\nShuanghu, Nagqu, Tibet, China https://www.google.com.sg/maps/place/36%C2%B003'52.3%22N+87%C2%B059'39.3%22E/@36.0700036,87.943404,28944m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d36.064514!4d87.994248\n\nFor people getting results in the middle of Michigan, remember that for google maps, the proper way to insert coordinates is with a comma. I had to change the string from (36.064514 -87.994248) to (36.064514, 87.994248) which then shows up in the very center of China. The placement of the pin feels too exact to be a coincidence, and leads me to believe that the China coordinates are the correct one. It also adds to my theory below. But I'll still admit it's all a big guess!\n\nEDIT 2: (thoughts)\n\nI don't know if this is really the thing, but you mentioned that it was your birthday soon. I live in Asia, and we have a tradition here where we give money to our friends on certain occasions in what we call 'ang bao'. It translates directly to 'red bag', and is also a Chinese tradition. The coordinates lead to as central of China as you can get. Perhaps this is trying to tell you that someone's gonna give you a big fat stack of cash soon.\n\nOr kill you, I dunno.\n\nEDIT 3:\nI came to the realisation after that negative coordinates also work. I'm not trying to weasel out of this. I'll put my hand up to the oversight. That said, I would still have figured China due to the very odd pin placement that read far more to me like a purposeful move.\n\nNow that it's solved, congrats OP on your birthday trip to China! You have some good friends indeed.",

            "There are a number of differences:\n\nGenghis Khan's actions were brutal, but somewhat considered \"standard practice\" in his time. He didn't off himself when cornered, IIRC when he died the Mongol empire was near/at its peak. Additionally, previous to Genghis Khan there was no mongolian nation or unity, mostly just tribes fighting each other.\n\nOn the other hand, Hitlers' actions were brutal even for his time. He didn't die leaving behind a successful empire, he killed himself to avoid a worse fate. Finally, he didn't succeed in uniting anything or anyone. All nations - including his own - (and maybe excluding the swiss) are worse off because of him.\n\nThe most important difference is the portrayal of both men in history books. Songs about Genghis Khan are well received because he is considered a successful conquerer. Songs about Hitler are not well received because he is considered a genocidal loser.",

Now they may have done some things considered genocide, but targeting city-states that killed the Mongol ambassadors presenting the demands for surrender is different than just deciding that several ethnicities don't have a right to exist.",

It\u00b4s pointless.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo in summary, the power structures since 1945 haven\u00b4t really changed.

            "Okay, so there's probably at least one. The thing is, while Hitler is the current boogeyman (for rather valid reasons) in much of the world, it's worth noting that not every place on earth shares that association. Thailand fucking loves Hitler. Not a joke.\n\nThey have boy bands and pop stars that dress up as Nazis. There's Hitler fried chicken (yes, it is done in the KFC style, picture the colonel with a toothbrush moustache and you're pretty much spot on). He's used in their advertising for all kinds of products. So yeah, Thailand hearts Hitler, so while my googling isn't likely up to the task of finding Thai pop songs about hyper specific historical monsters, I would say the odds are non zero that there is at least one in which the architect of Germany's greatest shame is prominently featured. \n\nNow, here's the thing. Thailand didn't exactly feature prominently into the European theater of world war 2. In the Pacific front, it adopted a stance if neutrality followed by capitulation to the Japanese government (which they saw as an ally against western imperialism, and who they believed night help then reclaim lost territory in the deal.) And so were functionally allied with Germany thought most of the war. Fast forward 70+ years, any historical mention of the war would likely involve that side of the narrative rather than the war crimes of a European strongman leader who was focused on a chunk of land they barely thought about on a day to day basis. They had their own local monsters that did pretty horrific stuff in their own backyard. The killing fields of much more nearby Cambodia are just one example, so they're no stranger to genocide. The Holocaust was a world away, happening to ethnic groups that were alien to the average person. In essence, Hitler is as removed from the experience of the average Thai citizen as Genghis Khan or Pablo Escobar or Rasputin would be to most of us. That separation makes one person's monster someone else's pop fodder...and sometimes a chicken chain mascot too.\n\nEdit- Thanks for the award! Feels a bit strange getting it for a post about murderous historical figures as they relate to pop culture, but I'll take it!",

What Genghis Khan did was brutal, but \u2018normal\u2019 for that era. But Hitler\u2019s activities were just insane even a few decades before his rise to power. Even in the 1900s, the British public turned against the concentration camps in South Africa. And that was not even close to the sheer scale of the Holocaust. \n\nIn short, I don\u2019t think it will every happen. At least the song will be seen as in incredibly poor taste the the singer or songwriter will be shunned by the dominant majority.",

The sheer horror of human beings being treated like cattle and killed in the most efficient, time saving, cheapest way possible while documenting everything, basically min-maxing a genocide, this horror is something that can hardly be conveyed by history books or movies.

To be concerned about being grown up, to admire the grown up because it is grown up, to blush at the suspicion of being childish; these things are the marks of childhood and adolescence. And in childhood and adolescence they are, in moderation, healthy symptoms. Young things ought to want to grow. But to carry on into middle life or even into early manhood this concern about being adult is a mark of really arrested development. When I was ten, I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so.

That modality of thought literally discounts and makes light of all creative and imaginative professions. \n\nThe only thing that the OP should be questioning is why they haven't started commiting their creations to a medium. Writing, painting, drawing, music, digital art, film, etc and so forth are all ways that you can develop these ideas and share them with others. Even if you choose not to share them with others (which would be a loss to the world as a whole) consider taking some of your ideas and cataloging them through one creative outlet or another. Feed your creativity and don't repress it for any reason. The individuals I've encountered that embrace their imagination and creativity are typically the most fulfilled and self actualized people it has been my pleasure to know. \n\nDon't let the Breakfast Club quote happen to you, \"When you grow up your heart dies.\" Instead take the time out of the daily grind to embrace your creative spark, inventiveness, fantasy, and imagination.

Maturity has to do with your behaviour & how you handle life, & I don't mean stuff like jumping in puddles or getting all gooy when you see a puppy. We're talking stuff like how you handle criticism, can you take responsibility when you make a mistake, are you gracious when others make mistakes.

            "Let me tell you a little story.  Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was an Anglican minister, who had three daughters and a son (there were two other daughters, but they and their mother died before our story begins).  They were very poor, and lived way out in the moors, where there were very few other children to play with, and not a lot of toys.  \n\nOne day, the minister gave the son a box of toy soldiers.  The children, all of them, absolutely fell in love with these soldiers.  Each of the children picked one or two of the soldiers out of the box, named them, and began playing together, telling each other stories of their little heroes and the adventures they got up to.\n\nIt became a house pastime, even as the children grew older, went away to school.  They'd write letters like, \"Today I sewed a new handkerchief for Dad.  Meanwhile, Colonel Tin-Hat led a force of brave soldiers to battle in Angria and was victorious!\" They wrote pretend histories about the soldiers, the countries they lived in, the literature and music of those cultures that only existed in their minds.  it had become more than a pastime, it had become a passion.\n\nThe children became adults.  They continued to write, a skill they had all learned from their stories about the soldiers.  They wrote poetry and plays, and even novels, like \"[The Tenant of Wildfell Hall](https://www.amazon.com/Tenant-Wildfell-Hall-Wordsworth-Classics/dp/1853264881)\" and \"[Wuthering Heights](https://www.amazon.com/Wuthering-Heights-AmazonClassics-Emily-Bront%C3%AB-ebook/dp/B073QM98F5/ref=sr_1_4?crid=30XMU39GUB9EY&dchild=1&keywords=wuthering+heights+by+emily+bronte&qid=1587217167&s=books&sprefix=wuther%2Cstripbooks%2C207&sr=1-4)\" and \"[Jane Eyre](https://www.amazon.com/Jane-Eyre-Charlotte-Bronte-Classics-ebook/dp/B07M6F9J6T/ref=sr_1_4?crid=1IKXAIT5UH0ZT&dchild=1&keywords=jane+eyre+book&qid=1587217212&s=books&sprefix=Jane+Eyre%2Cstripbooks%2C214&sr=1-4).\"   The brother died, but the sisters became immortal through their words.  \n\nSeriously.  The Bronte sisters started out writing about a box of tin soldiers.  [You can still read some of the stuff they wrote about their fictional shared world](https://www.amazon.com/Tales-Glass-Town-Angria-Gondal-ebook/dp/B005PUWTD6/ref=sr_1_fkmr1_1?dchild=1&keywords=angria+and+gondol&link_code=qs&qid=1587217077&sr=8-1-fkmr1).  All of them thought about those worlds and wrote about those worlds, and learned their writing chops from those worlds.  \n\nKeep dreaming your world, and feel free to write it down, if it moves you to do so.  If some of the most respected authors in the world didn't feel ashamed to do it, why should you?",

            "The concept of \"maturity\" is silly.\n\nYou do what you do.

            "When I was a child I wanted to be an Army man and I did it. I didn't realize what being a soldier would actually be like and it's miserable and you're around a bunch of really stupid people who think they're smart. It was an extremely negative environment that was managed by fear and to be honest they chewed me up during three deployments an infantry soldier and spit my ass out once I got injured.

            "Having an imagination is a good thing. It shows you have a creative mind. It is nothing to be ashamed of.  \n\n\nFor disclosure, I am a counselor/therapist in training who has had prior experience with age ranges 5 - 80. Having an imagination is a skill that a lot of adults lose, because of the notion it is childish. Research shows that having an imagination and playing pretend is beneficial for people of all ages. It keeps our brain active, which will help prevent cognitive decline from happening as a fast rate. It also enables you to have skills which are beneficial to employment such as thinking outside of the box. It also helps with all skills you currently have. The productive/creative brain is not stagnant, which for the record, stagnation in life is usually the first sign of a decline in mental and physical health.  \n\n\nWhile an active imagination and playing \"pretend\" are very important in our continuing cognitive health, due to societal norms, it is still viewed as childish. Because of this, I would encourage anyone who may feel insecure to be mindful about who they disclose this type of information to. Having an active imagination is a sign of emotional intelligence though, so be proud that you have never let go of that skill.",

            "It stands to reason that some prices goes up more than the average.",
            "Inflation means average raise of prices. And it doesn't take into accounts all goods and services usually. Most countries have what's called a basket of goods which is basically the most common things people buy (milk, eggs etc.) And so consumer inflation in those countries is the amount by which these products have grown in a certain period.\n\n Even if you are using the meteic of all prices somehow then you'll still have some goods that went up 5% and some that went up 500% and some that went down 20%. The number of 6% is an average. \n\nInflation is a bit more complex than that even and the majority of people don't understand fully how it works and what it means. Like for example imagine you work for a company that makes milk. And now you see that inflation of consumer prices of goods went up 6% over the past year. This bacislly means you have to pay 6% more money than you did last year for the same amount of things. People think the solution to this is to come to your boss and make him raise your salary by 6% which makes sense since now you will be back to being able to afford the same goods. But the company you work for won't be able to get this extra money out of nowhere. So what will they do? They will raise the prices of their goods. And this further leads to more inflation. \n\nNow the salary portion isn't relatively very big in the price of milk or other goods but this combined with the other goods your company has to buy (which also increased by 6% or more) makes the costs of this company very high. Add a higher sales tax with that and you'll see that the milk company now has to considerably raise the proce of their goods to continue receiving the same profit (just like the worker needed a 6% raise to keep receiving the same amount of goods). But this would only further make the problem worse.\n\nThis is just one example of how complex inflation can be.",

Once you read and understand the basic function of capitalism as an economic system everything in society makes a lot more sense.\n\nI'll link one of Einstein's quotes instead here. There's plenty from many different people \n\nA bit reason why is. \n\n\"Private capital tends to become concentrated in few hands, partly because of competition among the capitalists, and partly because technological development and the increasing division of labor encourage the formation of larger units of production at the expense of smaller ones. The result of these developments is an oligarchy of private capital the enormous power of which cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organized political society. This is true since the members of legislative bodies are selected by political parties, largely financed or otherwise influenced by private capitalists who, for all practical purposes, separate the electorate from the legislature. The consequence is that the representatives of the people do not in fact sufficiently protect the interests of the underprivileged sections of the population. Moreover, under existing conditions, private capitalists inevitably control, directly or indirectly, the main sources of information (press, radio, education). It is thus extremely difficult, and indeed in most cases quite impossible, for the individual citizen to come to objective conclusions and to make intelligent use of his political rights\"",

If a new company figures out a way to make a better widget at the cost of $15, and they put it out for $60 the general consensus will  be that the $60 product must be inferior so it won't sell like the $100 widget.

Steel skyrocketed 3x to 4x it's normal price.  Lead times to get steel went from 1 to 2 days to 3 to 4 months.  You used to be capable of buying 100 sheets of steel just randomly from most any vendor at whim and get it all in a few days.  It went to fighting for 1 sheet here or there and maybe being able to get that 1 sheet in a couple weeks at 4x the cost.  You were forced to plan far, far in advance, put in large blanket orders for 6 months of work months early.  You tried a dozen different vendors and jumped around them picking up scraps.  You bought odd sheet sizes.  You bought damaged sheets.  You modified your products for what was available at that moment.  You had to do really weird stuff just to get anything.\n\n2 years later it's much better, but some odd this is still skills play.  You can't just order on whim.  You still have long lead times. And the price is still 2x what it's supposed to be.\n\nThat's just steel.  But it's everything.  Motor, pumps, switches, all kinds of components.  Even right note we can't get two models of pumps despite having an order placed half a year ago.  And that's after the OEM already started back up production a year and a half ago.\n\nIt's a mess, a very, very costly mess.  We've easily seen a 2x increase in raw costs to build products.  And those costs have to get pushed onto you the customer or we simply don't survive.  For 2021 and into 2022, most businesses were losing money until they got prices reset.  Even after a 2x increase, this is still a barely profitable state.\n\nThe supply chain is slowly getting better, but it's exceptionally slow in some areas.  Other areas like fasteners like nuts and bolts recovered fast in just a few months.  But some areas haven't at all, even after 2 years.  On the whole, things are improving.

The rate at which new money is being printed (so if the Treasury destroys 1 dollar but prints 2 new ones that is 1 \"new\" dollar so to speak).

Most people don't in general.\n\nThe days of planning five to ten years ahead are over, so we have an entire society built on speculation and greed without considering the consequences, at least in the US.\n\nAlso, bear in mind that people who bought out toilet paper or masks in early 2020 and tried to flip them later for nose bleed prices got a lot of flack, got banned from online stores, or were even arrested on criminal charges.\n\nWhen companies do similar things with housing, cars, or other semi-necessities, it's just 'the market'.",

With our first, we were zombie and suffered frequent auditory hallucinations, especially of a baby crying at night.  The effects are pretty profound.  But you learn tricks, like sleeping in shifts.  Mom takes the first 4 hours of the night, dad gets the last, and you sleep when you can in between.  That way, you can get some decent sleep.  Also, if they nap, you better try to nap too.\n\nIt's frankly very tough the first time, and it can be very detrimental both physically and mentally.

It's not recommended by anybody and it's actually dangerous for humans and while I'm not saying that a mom or two has fallen asleep while the kid is nursing but they have. \n\nKeep in mind that most people decide to have children in the early prime of their life so they have a lot of extra energy but if you ever see parents looking like walking zombies their kids are probably the reason.",

The main issue is that everyone raised here already learned imperial for most day to day uses, and trying to undo those ingrained visualizations turned out to be very difficult. \n\nInstead we actually use a hybrid system not too dissimilar to Canada and the UK. Essentially for any non-scientific or engineering work we use imperial. While engineering and scientific institutions use metric. At least for the most part. Like if you worked at NASA or any space/rocket company you'd be using metric to build and engineer everything. Same for any scientific work, you'd measure and weigh everything in metric. Outside of those fields though everything is in imperial. \n\nThe effort, time, and money it would take to actually switch over completely would be more than reasonably makes sense. Especially since the only areas that would need switching over aren't important at all. The important areas already use metric.

People in the US can just intuitively understand that something weights around 1 pound by holding it, but changing the way their brains think to do the same with 1 kilogram is extremely difficult. I presume it is the opposite for people who don\u2019t use the customary system. And as other have said, we really use a mix of the systems. For sodas, for example, we use 1 and 2 liter bottles all the time. And damn near every package in grocery stores has the customary and metric system units on them for their weight/mass, so even a European coming to live in the US could probably get away with learning relatively little about the customary system other than maybe temperature (and Fahrenheit is the superior temperature scale for weather and I will die on this hill).",

Great, so there\u2019s 100 centimeters to a meter, and 100 cubic centimeters of water weigh one kilogram. Never have I ever used that fact outside of a science class. But I have a better intuition of what 10 feet represent, or half an inch, or 2 pounds. I remember as a kid going to farmers markets in my village in Europe and people were using pounds, because they had a better sense of what one pound of cherries are versus 200 grams. Soda cans are 10 ounces. Or, sure. 33 centilitres. I know what to wear when the temperature is in the 70s or the 50s or the 80s. But if it\u2019s 17 degrees Celsius? I have to think about it.",

            "1: Metric exists for very specific reasons, you're not a scientist, and you don't work in a lab. Your usage of metric is functionally no different than the casual person's usage of Imperial units. Your familiarity with them comes from exposure. Mainland Europe is basically the only place that has seen much success using exclusively metric- Commonwealth countries still frequently make use of Imperial units, and many other countries either directly use older measuring systems or something that approaches relative units. Because everyone who says \"Half a kilo\" is just saying, \"Ah just gimme some of that bullshit.\" \n\n\n2: Imperial was actually pushed because, among other things, everything is divisible by two- metric's big claim to fame is that everything is divisible by 5's and 10's. Problem? Well, metric will struggle to halve more than once. Imperial can half a half of a half fairly easily. People point out Imperial's goofy conversions but it was never intended to be expressed like that. You'll round to the nearest half inch or foot and in most practical applications that's fine because you're measuring people, not expressing a chemical formula. \n\n\n3: Literally every single everything would have to be re-made. Every street sign, every product, every restaurant menu, eeeeverything. It's simply not worth the political blood bath to deal with, \"So-and-So is trying to take away your quarter pounder with cheese!\"",

When a shipment is received, they scan it and enter it into inventory. The standard says all weight and units must be on the packaging, but of course not all suppliers comply 100% of the time.\n\nIn one instance, a product was received and labelled as wt: 800. No units. Warehouse, in a rush, logged it as 800 kgs. Simple mistake. Whenever the product is used, the operator pulls the product, weighs it, uses what they need, and re-weighs when returning to warehouse. \n\nSo eventually we used the whole 800 lbs (about 360 kgs), and the warehouse said we had 440 kgs left in the warehouse. So orders that require this material are all late, we had employees searching the whole plant to try and find the missing 440 kgs (that never existed), and we had to rush order material in. Lots of costs and delays related to a single error.\n\nTo switch the world's largest economy over to different units would cause millions of errors just like the one I mentioned, many bound to be far more critical.\nThe trouble just isn't worth it.",

When I was in elementary school all they taught me was metric, and we were getting ready for the big switch. \n\nThe problem is that The United States is a MASSIVE country, and the states control their own roads, regulatory agencies, and so on. Switching every single road sign to metric turned out to be unappealing, especially to stubborn flyover and deep south states with limited budgets and a stick-in-the-mud \"America is the best at everything so why should we change to be like Europe?\" attitude. Same with agencies, schools, and many other places where every bit of our systems of measurement would have to be re-designed. \n\nSo it never happened. They tried. States dragged their asses, and it never materialized. Meanwhile, I *still* struggle with the Imperial system because it's a nonsensical bunch of crap and I was taught Metric as a kid in the 70s and 80s. \n\nI comfort myself by saying at least we don't measure our weight in *stone,* like the U.K. seems to enjoy.",

The US is such a large and influential country that there is very little benefit in doing so for a really big cost. Changing road signs and such is one obvious cost, but a lot of items are manufactured using the US customary units and are therefore incompatible with things like bolts created using SI measurements. Entire supply chains would be uprooted if they were forced to change.\n\nIf the US was a small, not influential country, switching fully to Metric would make sense. But people will do business with the US regardless of what measurement systems they use.\n\nAlso, I believe at some point they did switch the \"official\" units to SI, but there's very little in the way of mandating it.

A rod is 16 and-a-half feet, and there's four rods to the chain.  A stone is 14 pounds.  Weird and archaic, sure, but there's always a reason for that unit hidden in history.  All base units have an arbitrary foundation. The mile is based on how far 1000 paces would carry an ancient roman legionaire. Centigrade is based on the freezing and boiling of water in certain very particular conditions.  I guess that makes sense because water is common and most people are familiar with its phase changes.  On the other hand, Fahrenheit scaled his system so that most ambient temperatures that people encountered would fall within 0 to 100 range.  Maybe 212\\*F is a weird temp, but that wasn't the focus of his scale. He was trying to quantify the experience of weather. \n\nOn the other hand, when I'm trying to make half of a recipe that calls for 1 and 2/3 cup, I'm pretty annoyed that there's no 1/6 lines on the measuring cup.

            "Alright so I don't really see a full answer so I'm gonna throw this in here. I'm basing most of this from an [interview by Adam Ragusea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OeoBbjwEFg) with Dr. Stephen Mihm, a history professor at the University of Georgia who is (or at least was at the time) writing a book on this subject. The video itself is very good (as are most of his videos) and worth the watch if you have 13 minutes. It mostly covers the history behind it but also gives a lot of insight into why it was historically resisted, and the reasons the US can't/won't just switch over.\n\nThe historic reason for the imperial system, or other measuring systems built around 12/16 is the combination of humans being able to intuitively measure halves of things and the divisibility of numbers. It's easier to judge half of a base unit than it is to judge a tenth of a base unit, and all of the following values that are commonly used are simply half of the previous measurement. The other main contributing factor is when working with measures that are based around 12 (such as 12 inches in a foot), you can get a half, third, quarter, and a sixth of a foot while still using integers of the next unit. These reasons are pretty much outdated (and have been for a while) because of better measuring equipment, particularly computers. And also the metric system offers much better precision, which is more necessary/desirable now than it was in the past.\n\nSo why not just switch over now then? According to Dr. Mihm, the reasons for not switching over now are very likely similar to the reasons for not switching over previously when the benefits of the metric system switched to being more than the benefits of the imperial system \n\nAll the machines/industrialization stuff that was made before the switch would need to be rebuilt or refactored, which would be very expensive and at a large scale. So making a big switch at a national level would cost companies a lot of money, particularly since the ratio of domestic trade to exports is more towards domestic trade than it was in other countries that switched from their own measurement systems into metric; if your economy primarily relied on exports then it financially incentivizes using a globally standardized measurement system. Since companies have historically had a decent impact on politics (through lobbying or simply by being a part of the US economy), there wasn't ever really much political push for it. Also, historically people in the US tended to be against globalization, but also (and probably more relevantly to today) there are a lot of people who don't like big government control over things. So for politicians, trying to convert everything to metric loses favorability both from companies (b/c it costs them money) and voters (because it's the government telling businesses what to do), while also not gaining enough favorability from people who want the nationalized metric system. So most politicians decided to leave it up to industries to switch to it once they decided it was worth it (like medical and scientific work, baking, etc. have already done). While it's not really possible to say anything that concrete about whether those are the reasons today, they were the historical reasons for not switching - as described by the historian in the interview linked above - that could still apply (unlike metric being harder to use without good measuring tools, which isn't particularly relevant anymore).",
            "Because \"just switching over\" would cost billions of dollars.  \n\nIn the 1970s, the federal government tried to mandate metric signs (kilometers and km/hr) on freeways.  States refused to pay for it and the idea fell apart.",
            "There\u2019s nothing to gain and plenty to lose politically from trying to legislate this. If you\u2019re a politician and you champion this cause, it won\u2019t likely result you getting a single extra vote. And if ANYTHING goes wrong (i.e. a space shuttle explosion due to mis-measured components), you will be blamed and it will be made the example of why it is a bad idea.\n\nIn the end, even if you\u2019re successful, people will still blame you for forcing them to measure things differently when the old way worked \u201cjust fine\u201d. The only thing we gain is being able to go to other countries and having foreigners come here without having to adapt. Anti-intellectuals and xenophobes generally don\u2019t leave their own state, so ease of travel won\u2019t matter to them, and having foreigners come here is a negative in their eyes."
