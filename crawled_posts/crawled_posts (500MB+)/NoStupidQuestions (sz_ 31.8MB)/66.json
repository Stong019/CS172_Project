The plan is to heat it up on the fire and float it on the lake to cool it.\r  \n\r  \nThe directions called for an electric mixer and he brought... a tiny little wire whisk.\r  \n\r  \nI watched some of the most physically fit guys I've ever seen take turns trying to frappe cheesecake mix by hand, passing it around every couple of minutes when their arms couldn't take it anymore. So yes, real men bake.\r  \n\r  \nDamn good cheesecake.",

            "Before, but they called them paper darts. ",
            "It is believed that the Chinese were the first to construct stuff like paper airplanes (since they were the original inventors of paper). It is also said that the Wright brothers used paper airplanes as part of their research in building the first plane that carried people. But paper airplanes really didn't become popular until WW2, when material to make toys was limited, but paper was plentiful.",
            "Hey, I figured there had to be some existing writing on the subject so I thought I'd take a look around the internet. Surprisingly, Wikipedia's history section did say that the **Ancient Chinese made paper airplane like origami structures**, but it lacked citation. So I decided to poke around more.\n\nKen Blackburn, holder of the Guinness World Record for longest paper plane flight, has a history page on his [site](https://www.paperplane.org/about). He describes predecessors like Chinese paper kites and French paper air balloons, handheld folded gliders. He cites that the earliest source he's found for \"paper planes\" specifically is a book by aircraft designer Jack Northrop from the 1930s, who used them during prototyping. If we count prototyping, then the Wright brothers undoubtedly constructed models as well, so I wanted to focus on recreational usage.\n\nAn author H.G.G. Herklots seems to have the first book specifically using the term \"paper airplanes\" as a way to pass time, which has him constructing them in 1918.\n\nLooking back further, it **becomes challenging to search for because \"plane\" and \"airplane\" aren't the words we would've used prior to 1903** \u2014 the year of the Wright Flyer, generally accepted to be the first airplane. However, there are numerous references to ***paper darts*** in sources older than 1903. For example, from a story in The British Essayists published in 1803:\n\n>...he presented himself to the wondering eyes of Euphorion with a huge black bush wig stuck full of paper darts, and as thickly spiked as the back of a porcupine.\n\nAnd another from The Spectator, Volume 23, 1850 :\n\n>If I'm not there they'll be larking about throwing paper darts etc. and messing the place up.\n\nInitially I wasn't totally confident that paper darts were quite what we were looking for, but after digging through a number of different 19th century activity books, I am happy to say that I found this [diagram in Cassell's Complete Book of Sports and Pastimes: Being a Compendium of Out-Door and In-Door Amusements from 1896:](https://ibb.co/bXSywvJ)This hardly answers the question on the date of invention, but I think it's safe to say this **qualifies and certainly predates the invention of the airplane.**\n\nI suspect the difficulty of this hunt is due to the fact that the search is limited to only English sources. Given that origami is extremely old (6th century), it's inevitable that the Chinese would have created gliding constructions. Flying origami structures were incredibly popular with the ancient Chinese. So, the best guess would be that **paper airplanes indeed date far back than real airplanes even though they went by different names.**",

The Last of Us Part 1 for example is like a 10-12 hour long game, which is basically a season of a TV show. It's not open world like GTA, so you really have to follow the linear path of the story. You can break it up into 1-2 hour sessions and play it like you would watch a weekly TV show. Or binge it in two sittings in one weekend like I did. After the story is over the game is done.\n\nIf you have time to watch a TV show, you have time to game. Especially most story driven linear single player games, they're all more or less similar in length. And with subscriptions like GameFly and Gamepass it pretty much costs the same as a streaming subscription as well.\n\nI wonder why people got this idea that gaming has to be some disproportionate time commitment.",

            "Even if someone has hobbies that take the same amount of time as gaming, they don't necessarily have any time that isn't currently allocated to something. \"I have no time\" can often mean \"I have no time that isn't currently taken up by something I need to do/would rather do/have the energy to do over something else.\" \n\nAlso, some people prefer to be able to take large blocks to play games and don't have those large time blocks open.",
            "You're right that depending on how much time you sink into one game, it quickly becomes one of the cheaper forms of media.\n\nHowever, the initial cost is usually higher. Not just of the games themselves, but also the cost of a console and controllers or a decent gaming pc. If someone isn't sure whether they'd like the hobby or not, that can be a major deterent.",
            "A lot of people watch things as a communal activity, with their other half or whatever. On the other hand most people consider single player games solitary activities - it takes a particular sort of person to enjoy watching someone else play a game, or sit in the same room and play games separately. I think that's one of the big differences. I love games but when my gf comes round I typically stop playing and we choose something to watch.",
            "You deleted your comment by the time that I was done replying, but I'll paste it here:\n\n> most people assume gaming has to be a much larger time commitment than a TV show, and I'm wondering why that is.\n\nNot *time* commitment, but *attention* commitment definitely. Most people consider watching TV as a passive activity and gaming an active one. They do other stuff while watching TV, like chores, paperwork, research, etc. This is the \"adult lack of time\" that your friend was talking about.\n\nEDIT. A lot of r/ImTheMainCharacter  syndrome in the replies. You are not representative of all people. Congrats on watching TV with 100% of your brain.",
            "Personally, as a non-gamer, I don't play games for three reasons: (1) at the end of the day, I just want to not do anything mentally active and just turn on the TV/Netflix and watch something casually/have it in the background while doing other tasks (like watching an episode while I'm doing laundry). I feel like playing video games is a mental (albeit fun) task but I'm mentally drained after a full day of work and I just don't have the mental energy. \n\n(2) it's really hard to have a conversation about video games with my social group. I can easily talk about an episode of stranger things or the new avatar movie and dissect different scenes with my friends, but it's hard to really talk about a specific game scene/character (disclaimer: my friends are also non-gamers)\n\n(3) Cost. I just don't want to spend $500 on a new console and $60 on a new game (or a monthly video game subscription system)",
            "I can think of a few reasons;\n\n1. That's true for TLOU, but lot of games don't actually have defined end points, if you're playing Eve or, I don't know, FIFA or something, you can literally keep going forever if you want. And a lot of people don't have the self control to stop.\n\n2. TV can be a background activity whereas gaming can't by its nature. However, if what your TV is background to is just scrolling your phone then I think gaming is a better use of time tbh.\n\n3. People are picking one or the other, not both. He means, 'I don't have time to game AND watch TV.",
            "I would love if my SO would game in 1-2 hour sessions, he does not, he does open world raids that can last many, many hours -like top comment says, gaming isn't passive, you can't do anything else while you're gaming, it can definitely be a huge time investment but some people are willing to commit to it, others are not",

            "I\u2019ve never actually played The Last of Us, so I can\u2019t comment on the length of it specifically, but in addition to what other people have posted, I\u2019ll add that a game that would take an experienced gamer 10-12 hours to complete could take someone with less experience significantly longer. There are a lot of assumptions baked in any time the length of a game is given in some number of hours.",
            "Because you can watch TV while cooking, cleaning, doing exercise, sorting mail, folding clothes, watering plants, checking emails, painting nails\u2026\n\nVideo games require you to spend that time specifically on the game.",

            ">If you have time to watch a TV show, you have time to game. \n\nNo. It's one or the other. What you are discovering here is that some people would rather just watch TV than game. It's a lot easier to get sucked into a TV show and pass out than put a ton of attention and effort into a video game.\n\n\"I have no time to game\" in this context really means \"Other things take up too much of my time, so I don't have any left over for gaming\"",
            "Gaming doesn't work in hour long stretches. Plus you might **only** have that hour or two of free time so it's either watch a show **or** play a game, not both. \n\nWatching a show is easy and there's no learning curve that usually takes longer than an hour. \n\nIf you only played The Last of Us for an hour you wouldn't even have learned all the mechanics yet. \n\nAnd if you only have an hour then you're not going to progress in a natural way. \n\nAnd with some save systems it's not even possible or that efficient to stop in the middle of something if your hour is up.",

            "My wife and I watch TV shows while relaxing together. So it\u2019s together time. For alone time, I\u2019ll be playing musical instruments or making art. If I took up gaming I\u2019d have to give up something else that I care about. Gaming seems mildly interesting to me at best, compared to the other things in the world that are waiting for my attention.",
            "I don't watch TV shows either... because they are a giant time suck that I can't afford.",
            "> most story driven single player games are around 10-12 hours in length \n\nNot to be rude, but have you never played a JRPG before? I can think of dozens of games within that genre that are 40-60 hours in length, and almost all of those kinds of games are also story driven single player experiences.\n\nWith games like the Last of Us and Resident Evil, those *are* pretty short games that you can potentially binge in a weekend like you said. But I don't think that you can really say that *most* single player games are that short. Most of the Final Fantasy games (and there are at least 15 of them as of now), for example, are at least 40 hours in length, possibly much longer if you decide to take it slow and do a lot of the optional stuff that's not required for you to progress in the story. If you're a completionist, some of these games might take you 100 hours to fully complete. \n\nIt's possible that your friend feels like he doesn't want to rush into things with games like this. If he's the kind of person who feels like he has to resist the urge to play his games to 100% completion, then it might seem like a daunting task to play *any* video game, even the ones that are really short. Video games can be very addicting, and if you're not careful with how you spend your time with them, you could develop a legitimate addiction to them. \n\nNone of this is to say that video games are the devil, or that TV shows are any less addicting than video games. But there are legitimate reasons as to why someone might want to play them but decides not to. It also doesn't help that TV has been ingrained into our culture since at least the 1950s, while home console video games only became a phenomenon in the 1980s. A lot of people just aren't used to the concept of playing video games, and it might take them a lot of time to \"get good\" if they have no frame of reference for how to play them. Meanwhile, everyone and their grandma has watched a TV show at least once in their lives. Even if they don't like to watch TV, they still are more familiar with the concept of TV than video games. There are plenty of people alive today who have never touched a video game in their lives, but there's almost no one who's never watched TV before.",
            "I've never been a gamer but I did play a lot in the late 90s early 2000s. Too many times I would start playing a game like Vice City after dinner and then the sun started to come out. Somehow I lost 12 hours. I don't hate on others that play but I don't have the strength to limit myself properly.",
            "I can watch a show and not focus. Video games require focus and my hands.",
            "Something I haven\u2019t seen anyone else mention is that many of the games you\u2019re referencing are single player\u2014 and I mean true single person experiences. I would love to play more long, immersive one player games! But I often choose to do other things instead bc I can do them with my wife or friends. \n\nThat\u2019s not to say I don\u2019t play single player games\u2014I do. But I\u2019m usually cramming in an hour after my wife goes to bed, or 30 minutes of unexpected free time on the weekends. And some games just aren\u2019t conducive to playing 2 or 3 hours per week over a couple months without having to reteach myself the controls or mechanics, or remind myself what\u2019s going on. \n\nThat latter point is why I only made it 15-20 hours into Elden Ring. I started it when my wife had work but I had a 2 day holiday. I got about 12 hours in, but after that two day binge I played maybe 1-2 hours every few days. I simply could not remember what the ever loving hell was going on, especially without an in game journal. So I stopped playing.",
            "Your own explanation makes it seem that way. $12/month for all the Netflix I can watch, or $60 per video game? If I watch one season of a show per month or spend that same amount of time playing one video game, then gaming is 5x the cost.",
            "Honestly, any time someone says they 'don't have time for that' it just means they don't prioritize the event.  \n\nWhether it's reading or video games, I know a lot of friends that simply just don't care and will say 'I don't have the time for it'",

            "Because lots of gamers make it appear that way casually bragging about playing 12h a day. Vocal minorities have spread bullshit about hobbies for a long time. \n\nSame reason outsiders think that anime fans are a bunch of socially awkward weirdos with waifu pillows. They exist. And they\u2019re just easier to notice than an average person acting like a normal person.\n\nI need to add, I feel like 12h games are rather rare. Most single player rpgs I\u2019ve recently played are more between 40-60h. Still, it\u2019s nothing you\u2019re supposed to rush within a week.",
            "It's also a money issue. I love video games, but the biggest reason I didn't even start playing until 2020 was because of how much a console costs on top of not even being sure if I'd actually enjoy it enough to justify the cost.",

            "I'm a \"gamer\" and have been since the early 90s. I think for me its about the controls.

If I go a week or two without playing that game and its control scheme I kind of forget the muscle memory and feel like I shouldnt bother until I have enough time to propery learn the controls. Which in my busy life almost never happens. So I end up buying the next flavor of the month game thinking it will be different and it never is. Shame is even with games that have easy to remember controls just end up boring me.",
            "I mean, there isn't enough time to be interested in everything.

            "1. You can't multitasking while playing most games. Video games replace hobbies/reading, not television.\n\n2. Games aren't a good medium to experience good stories. TLOU's story is excellent compared to other video games, but you can experience better stories in less time by reading a book, watching a movie, or listening to a podcast\n\n3.

Gamers by and large do not understand how much time it takes to get used to game controls and mechanics, especially as an adult playing for the first time.\n\n2) Child-free. If you have kids, you don't really have time and energy to game, by and large -- at least, not if you are pulling your weight with the kids.

And trust me I love it sometimes when I'm tired after work. \n\nIt's also sooo much shorter, 20 mins and you are done, some people do not have much time for themselves. A game, depending on the kind, will take you 30 mins or 3 hours. Some you cannot stop in the middle, some just grab your attention so much that you sit until morning. \n\nIt's the same story with tv shows and a movie. A movie is 2h+ commitment. A tv show is 20 minutes x amount of episodes I'm willing to watch. 20 minutes and you can stop or continue. You will not stop a movie after 30 minutes (unless you are a barbarian than go ahead).",

The tutorial/intro is 2 hours long, fuck you, non-skipable.  \n\nA game requires my full attention for a period that's determined by the game and if I fail to pay attention for that amount of time I'm punished. \n\nI do like gaming and enjoy hard games, but these days I don't have the time for that so I don't play them.",

I don't get it. I feel video games are one of the best return on investments you can get",

            "Because the media have brainwashed people over the years into thinking that gaming is a terrible, harmful thing and the reasons for the ills in the world.\n\nGaming addiction is a problem but therefore so is binging tv shows if people equate time invested as being the main issue. However I\u2019ve noticed a trend in there being a stigma against games that require any kind of mental investment beyond time. \n\nE.g someone playing candy crush multiple times a day which adds up to over an hour compared to someone sitting and playing one game for an hour straight. The former seems to be more accepted than the latter.\n\nA lot of people also don\u2019t understand that games can be art and have well written narratives. Many think it\u2019s all running around and shooting people, playing football or driving fast cars.",
            "A SINGLE run-through of THAT game is maybe 10-12 hours IF you know more or less what you\u2019re doing. But you have to explore every nook and cranny, and if you\u2019re inexperienced to that type of game engine it\u2019ll take longer. And then you\u2019ll go back and play through it a second time or a third with different choices to see how it changes the outcome.\n\nAnd that\u2019s a notoriously SHORT video game. Cyberpunk 2077 is about 27 hours to beat if you ONLY focus on the main mission, and we\u2019ll over 100 hours of you delve into side missions (and we all know gaming isn\u2019t fun without a side quest!). And many of the most popular games don\u2019t have any real endpoint because they\u2019re multiplayer: things like CoD or WoW.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing\u2026 if my husband expected to spend 6 hours every day going to the bar with his friends - this missing dinner with me, foregoing a snuggle & movie on the sofa that I offered, and even turning down a blatant offer of sex - just about everyone would say, \u201cDude, you\u2019re neglecting your wife and spending too much time with your friends.\u201d But men will ROUTINELY do that exact same thing with online gaming. Or they\u2019ll leave out the friends part and do it with solo gaming.\n\nIf a partner came home, logged on, and spent an hour unwinding with a game before dinner or before bed, I don\u2019t think anyone would complain. But it never happens like that. It becomes 4 hours, 6 hours, 10 hours and by the way didn\u2019t you look at the time you\u2019re going to be hurting at work tomorrow morning. \n\nI know some gamer girls that game like that, but most of the gamer girls I know - even when we play the same games - will use moderation and play in smaller chunks of time. But every gamer guy I\u2019ve ever met - no matter how much they protest otherwise - if you actually look at their Steam stats, you\u2019ll find that they don\u2019t HAVE short gaming sessions; they only ever have marathons. That\u2019s the problem."

If you like her, and get along well, you liked the pictures when she was thinner, which is is totally able to get to again.\n\nA lot of people and ladies especially emotionally over eat or eat. A lot of men do this also, depression can easily cause this. So if you date her, she may stop over emotionally eating and will get down to a size you are more comfortable with. Heavy girls and thin girls are the same besides the look. I have met nice and total bitch versions of all body types. She could also have self confidence issues in being rejected that led to emotional issues and over and emotional eating.  It is very easy to get fat, I was there.

Except make it more eloquent and well thought out haha",
            "If the reason is she is too fat for you that would be pretty hurtful to say.  If the reason is she lied by using old photos of herself I would say that\u2019s a good enough reason on its own.",

            "you're in every right to feel how you feel, you were essentially catfished, it's up to you if you want to be brutally honest which might humble her so she doesn't do it again to someone else or just politely friend zone her",
            "Be honest. What she did was not be honest with u and that was the problem.",
            "No need to be rude, but also no need to lie",
            "Interesting answers. Personally, if I got catfished I would let her know that is the reason. \n\nSomeone does you wrong, you let them know it, no matter what situation. \n\nMaybe it will hurt her feelings, but hey, next time or after a couple of tries where she gets the same response she might realise that this method doesen't work. We will have one less catfish, and less headache for her victims.",

            "I'll tell ya one thing that I don't think the commenters realize. What she's doing is unethical and annoying, but it comes from a place of insecurity. Fact is, someone else will probably shit on her for doing this. And it won't be helpful at all",
            "Why are guys still asking this question, its ridiculous you dont like her tell her your just want to be friends.  That you just dont like her that way.  Since it sounds like you did enjoy talking to her.  When we meet people its either going to click or its not. No reason to completely humiliate someone for being slightly over weight. And one more thing.  Slightly overweight girls can lose that weight as quickly as they put it on so watch the bridges you burn.",
            "Just tell her you don't feel it or something. She knows she has a body and that it has a shape. She probably thinks about it way too much to be healthy without your help. You don't have to like people of certain shapes, and you don't have to like the fact that her photos aren't up to date, but you also don't have to tell her that. It's not going to help her.",
            "I mean consider giving it a shot weight is not an indicator of health or morality or even physical fitness. I mean but maybe she doesn't deserve some one so shallow",

OR if you care, offer advice if you consider her someone you want better results for. \nHappened to me too. My date was way older looking than his pics. I look younger than my age, and he looks way way older than his age. Not fair. Wasted my time. And my time is my least commodity with my work.",

            "I'm a big fella, so I rarely feel worried walking around. But once I was in Vegas with a buddy and a few guys were walking behind us for a while. It was 2am, August and hot as fuck. These guys were wearing large jackets and kept reaching inside them. My buddy was oblivious, but I stopped us right infront of a security camera, and just chatted. The guys following us kept coming, but out of the corner of my eye I saw one look up at the camera, say something to his friends and the left the way they came. My butthole was puckered pretty good. I feel bad that the ladies have to feel like this so often.",
            "They are cautious. My wife went to college in the early 1970s. A couple of the male professors there were so notorious *for groping women students* that if they got on an elevator, the women would get out.\n\nEdit: Typo, added a phrase for clarity.",
            "From my experience, the best way to avoid unintentionally scaring a lone woman in an elevator or small closed-off space is to just fuck around on my phone while only \"half-paying attention\" to my surroundings.\n\nThey usually relax after noticing that I have no interest in them and would rather be glued to my phone (for at most few minutes) to minimize face-to-face interaction. It also helps to have a relaxed, \"mellow\" bodily posture (if you're standing up all stuff and robot-like it looks creepy).",
            "Pull out your phone and start playing clash Royale with sound on. It will immediately relieve any tension in the situation.",
            "I'm not worried about sharing an elevator. I'm much more worried that they're going to follow me after I get off the elevator.\n\nETA: Holy jumpin'. Didn't expect this much reaction to my comment. Thanks y'all. I'm trying to read the replies!",
            "Yes, but don't take it personally.",
            "You kidding? Middle of the night at that size? You will run from from you.\n\nJokes aside, I'm male. 6'1. Even I feel the pressure with anybody being near me in the middle of the night. Especially someone bigger than me. It just isn't safe in many areas. Can't blame the lady.",
            "It can be common. However I would be on high alert with any stranger in a small space. I work as a child and adolescent psychiatrist now, but I did forensic psychiatry for years. It\u2019s not a bad idea to remain aware around strangers.",
            "In general it doesn\u2019t bother me. But context matters. Like 1am on the elevator at my condo where we\u2019re all neighbors and theres a doorman and security camera? No problem! Elevator in the dimly lit parking garage at 1am after I\u2019m leaving the bar? I\u2019m sure you\u2019re a nice guy, but I\u2019m still going to be a little on guard.",
            "I am a woman, and if I were riding an elevator at 1 AM and a 6'4\" guy got in with me, yes, I would be on edge.",
            "I was sexually assaulted by a man in an elevator when i was 10-11 years old. Hit the stop button then slammed me into the back wall of the elevator.  I am very uncomfortable alone in an elevator with a man who is physically bigger than me.",
            "To be honest, I'm a guy and I just hate being in an elevator with anyone I don't know ever. Even another guy I'm uncomfortable. I will be walking toward the elevator in my complex but if I hear other footsteps hearing the elevator I will turn around or walk to the nearest stairs, whichever is closer. I'm not socially anxious or anything, not claustrophobic, or anything of the like. Just hate being in an elevator with someone I don't know. \n\nTo actually answer your question, probably yes they are. If I was 5'5\" or so and some tall guy at 1am came into the elevator with me, I'd honestly probably get out and pretend to walk towards wherever I came from like I forgot something.",
            "I once rode an elevator with friend who was a girl, late at night, during a traveling field trip I think we were in Toronto. Along the ride 2 large men hopped on. After they left she was like HOLY CRAP CHARLIE IM GLAD YOU WERE HERE. \n\nSo I'll say yes",

            "Brother, one man to another, women are afraid of men. Period.",
            "In a situation like this I usually have a couple things I like to do. I'll face partially toward them so they can see my face and hands but not directly face them. I keep my hands visible but close to my body. Then the big thing I do is lean against the wall and rest my head/close my eyes like I'm resting. With your eyes closed you really can't do anything and from my experience seems the least threatening posture if you have to be in the same room with someone. Unfortunately that person wouldn't see any of that until the door is closed and they have no choice but to ride with you. Definitely better to ask or take the next one.",
            "Women fear men they do not know in general. Never know or are fully aware of their intentions and in an enclosed elevator with just the two of you could be intimidating to her.",
            "I\u2019m 6\u20198\u201d was working in my office on a saturday, I did not realize a girl who is like 4\u201911\u201d was also working we rounded a corner and she took about 3 steps of a run before realizing it was me and said she was sorry. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I have no perspective of how she feels so I didn\u2019t really feel like she should say sorry and I told her that, it does however remind me that I am a very tall human.",
            "Not a Woman, but think about it.\n\nAlone in an enclosed area, that can easily be stopped with a button, where nobody can help you. And with a random person. And most don't have cameras. I think it's perfectly reasonable for a Woman to feel scared. It's just sad we live in a society where they have to feel that way from sexual assault being so prevalent and even brushed off.\n\nMight seem extreme, but at that time of night, I'd probably take the next elevator and try and think of making the Woman more comfortable without me crowding her.  \n\n\nEdit- Probably hyperbole saying \"Most\" don't have cameras. My point still stands.",
            "In an enclosed room with a strange man and only one exit, which he's in front of? Yes she was scared.",

            "At 1 am yes",
            "There are many reasons for women to be afraid of men in elevators. They\u2019re generally taller and stronger, there are real stories and people with experience of being sexually harassed, and men tend to be more likely to commit a crime than women are.",
            "Depends on the context. Was it at your apartment complex? Was it at a hotel? If that was the case, I probably wouldn't be alarmed. Other situations, like an outdoor parking garage, yes. I'd be on edge.",
            "At work? No. \n\nAt my apartment and I\u2019ve never seen you before? I\u2019m always guarded.",
            "Yes. This is a very common thing. If I could, I would always pass on being alone with a dude in a elevator at late hours.",
            "As a large man (6'3, 250lbs) also, I have always wondered if some women are secretly clutching a weapon when they are around me. My wife had a knife open and ready in her pocket on our first date.",
            "I\u2019d bet that most times a woman is alone in an enclosed space (or anywhere without other people around) with an unknown man, she\u2019s going to be nervous. \n\nMy partner is 6\u20199\u201d, the most benevolent, feminist guy I\u2019ve ever met, and he\u2019s always in search of ways to look less intimidating and make sure women aren\u2019t on edge when he\u2019s around. The reality is that there isn\u2019t a way. If you try to strike up conversation, you may be scarier. \n\nI\u2019d say, try your best to look completely disinterested and preoccupied. Look at your phone, move to the other side of the street, maybe wait for the next elevator or take the stairs, etc.\n\nETA: these replies are so useless. Yes, because he actually listens to the women around him and knows that *we have reason* to be afraid of men, he\u2019s aware that his presence could be scary for a woman who doesn\u2019t know him. I\u2019m a sexual assault nurse examiner and I have heard hundreds of scenarios in which a person was hurt by a man when other people weren\u2019t around. Doesn\u2019t mean I think all men are dangerous. But I\u2019m not willing to take my chances so I am immediately on defense. And no, it\u2019s not exhausting for him to try making others comfortable. It\u2019s a normal part of being a kind person. And no, he doesn\u2019t think women need protection. He thinks women need one less scary moment in their day to day lives and doesn\u2019t want to be the reason someone feels stressed.",
            "Yes. We don\u2019t know what to think, and we are cautious. Every single woman knows someone who has been hurt, attacked, followed, threatened, or something of that sort. Especially at night, and especially when we are alone, we are not likely to take chances.",
            "No, I wouldn't be but I can understand others feeling that way. \n\nI might suggest pretending to be on the phone with your mom or something.",
            "I've had guys demand I go to their hotel room. I've had hair sniffers. Then there are the guys who stand too close. Basically, we know most men are decent but how are we supposed to know who is safe? The unknown is terrifying.",
            "As a man, I just avoid being in the general vicinity of women at odd hours. They don't need the stress, I don't need a pepper spray to the face.",
            "I'm sure they do. I've even had a woman be scared that I was going to rob her. I'm in a wheelchair, so I was like, \"It's not like I can outrun you if I did.\"\n\nIn a way, it makes me sad that they think any guy can rob or attack them, even paraplegic ones who can be stopped by stairs. One of our society's shortcomings.",
            "Absolutely. I'm 6'3 235 lbs and I've found the best way to handle it is to stand looking at the front corner that's not the button corner. Everyone is free to stand behind me and watch me while I can't see them. If it's extra tense I hold my phone a little higher so anyone can see I'm just a dude looking at a social media feed on my way home. It's gonna be awkward, no way around it. And for good reason: people are fucked.",
            "In college I looked like a dirt bag with long hair, tyedye, and ill fitting jeans. I still remember one afternoon going down to the lobby in the elevator when it stopped on another floor. The door opened and a woman looked at me, then turned around and took the stairs.\n\nHonestly I don't even blame her. I know I'm harmless but she had no way to know.",
            "I think so because I had a woman intentionally shut the door quickly with the button to avoid me entering lol no joke",
            "At night (and even the day), every man is Schrodinger's rapist to the average woman. He both is and isn't until something happens or you part ways. It's absolutely exhausting for women but assault is so common we can't afford not to be on edge",
            "Yes",
            "Yes, we are.",
            "I don't mind sharing the elevator with men. I do feel awkward (regardless of gender) because being in a small space while being silent feels rude. Makes me feel like I need to make small talk for the 30 seconds it takes to get to my floor lol.",
            "Women are afraid of men in elevators on multiple levels.",
            "I am. And would get off the elevator. No offense but not everyone is nice and I\u2019m not tying to die.",
            "I've had dudes see I was alone in the elevator in broad daylight and say \"I'll catch the next one.\"\n\nThey are good dudes.",
            "yes. i am always on my phone in the elevator with my camera very visibly open and sending selfies to my friends",
            "Yes. If you want to help make others comfortable, pull out your phone or bring a book and pretend to be absorbed in it. \n\nAs a woman being alone in an elevator with a large guy who I didn't know would definitely have me very cautious. Especially at 1 a.m.",
            "Yeah, you can\u2019t walk through a parking garage as a woman without clutching your keys so you have a makeshift weapon. Being a woman means having your guard up at all times. My best friend was raped in a parking lot while putting her groceries away. A man just snatched her, threw her in her own car and raped her. It happens all the time, all over the world.",
            "You could kill her with your bare hands without even trying. She has to stand within your reach. She knows nothing about you. Her fear is rational.",
            "Male here: \n\nI always use my phone even if I have nothing to use it for and turn away from the woman so that she can feel that I\u2019m not interested in the slightest and she can feel relaxed.",
            "I was in a situation like this. I saw a woman was alone in the elevator at night and chose not to enter. I'm a big scary looking guy but I will walk over any insect or bug on the ground that I can see and I do not raise my voice or get violent with people even when my life is threatened lol. (Actually happened a few times, being threatened by the mentally unhinged \"Alpha Male\".)",
            "The only real solution is to lie flat on the floor, facing down, with your hands behind your back for the entire ride. Establish full submission to convince her you are not a threat. The confusion will ease the tension. \n\nSerious answer: just act normal. We can\u2019t control how we are perceived. All we can do is not actually do anything wrong. Or, if you\u2019re not in a rush, tell her you\u2019ll wait for the elevator to come back down. Might be overkill but if you\u2019re more worried about putting her on edge than getting back to your apartment sooner, you may consider that the best option.",
            "Personally, if I have to use an elevator at 1 a.m., I'm using it alone.   I don't care if it's a male or female getting on, I'm hopping off and taking the next ride.\n\nShady stuff at night (or any time of day) isn't exclusive to the male gender.",
            "I once wanted to use the elevator at a late time and a lone woman was inside already.\nI said to her \"I'll take the next one\" and I staid outside. she said thank you.\n\nSometimes one should be more considerate towards women at later hours, remember that they are already uncomfortable being alone",
            "Yes, you may not be a threat but as women we have no way of knowing that and have to be on edge. If I am alone with a man (especially one I don\u2019t know) I usually have an exit in mind just in case. With an elevator there is no way out and nowhere to hide.",
            "You have to understand that a lot of us women are always on guard and act cautiously around strangers.  I\u2019m on high alert just walking out to my car in a parking lot and I don\u2019t have anyone that I know of following me\u2026.especially at night.  Some of us have trauma in our past with men so we are always expecting to be victimized again.  If it happened once, it can happen again kind of a deal.  So yeah, I would be spooked if I was on an elevator alone and a guy got in with me at 1am.",
            "Yes. I'd be scared of you. As a woman, if I'm alone with a stranger man at 1am in an elevator, fuck politeness.",
            "Personally, no. I've never had anything bad happen to me though. Lots of women have been assaulted and I cannot and won't speak on their behalf. \n\nBut on the behalf of someone who has lived an incredibly easy life free of assault, I am fine with being alone with men in enclosed spaces. If I had been assaulted at any point I can imagine not being OK with it.",
            "I\u2019m not comfortable in an elevator with a guy I don\u2019t know.",
            "Depends on the guy. But if you give me bad vibes, I\u2019m not getting on and could care less if it seems \u201crude.\u201d",
            "unfortunately. but don\u2019t take it personally. shit happens to women often and it makes sense to be on edge in situations like that",
            "Elevator mechanic here. And I\u2019m about your size. \n\nI make it a point to be presentable on the job. And have a friendly demeanor. Since I\u2019m in and out of elevators hourly with other folk, I try to practice best elevator etiquette. \n\nLate nights in offices are when I get \u201clooked at with concern\u201d.  A \u201cgood evening\u201d and a smile followed by a healthy dose of minding my business      Normally quells an uneasy look I get. Also, social distancing worked well before Covid. \n\nWe really can\u2019t blame anyone for feeling uneasy while riding in a box with a stranger. Being polite and not trying to go out of your way is the best solution.",
            "Actually, in many ways most men aren\u2019t aware of, women are constantly on guard and checking to make sure we\u2019re safe and measuring risks. Everything from where we travel or walk at night, in a parking lot at a mall or grocery store, elevators, any unknown areas, locking car doors, gas stations while filling your tank ( remember to lock car doors while doing that, etc. It\u2019s not that we\u2019re paralyzed by fear, just can\u2019t be ignorant of the fact that dangers exist and some people are evil, sadly many times those ppl are men. Fact of life.",
            "A little, because it\u2019s a small enclosed space with no way to exit until you get off, and there aren\u2019t always cameras. \nLuckily I\u2019ve never felt threatened myself, but I have felt uncomfortable a few times when guys in my old building would start asking me personal questions when I had no way to really not engage (\u201chey I\u2019ve seen you around, how long have you lived here? What\u2019s your name?\u201d Etc)",
            "Not that scared but im cautious",
            "I get the feeling this question is less about the specific situation - it's night time, you're alone in an elevator, you're much larger than she is, it's pretty easy to see why she'd be scared in these circumstances - and more about whether women are scared of you? \n\nIt's almost certainly nothing personal. Women are basically trained to fear being  blamed for their own rape. \nWomen walk this sickening tightrope where they are simultaneously hyper aware of their physical weakness compared to most men, while knowing that if they are assaulted, they will also be blamed for it. \nYes he's 6'4\", but what were you wearing?\nWhy were you alone in an elevator at 1am anyway?\n\nTo be honest, she was probably aware of you as a person but wasn't prepared to interact with you on that level. She wasn't just riding in the elevator; she was watching, she was waiting, and statistically it's also likely she was remembering some past unpleasant event. \nSo if she was unfriendly towards you, it's not you, and it's not the elevator. If she looked or acted scared, it's not that you are necessarily a threatening person or that you did anything wrong. It's just that women are constantly put in positions where they have to decide between their own sense of physical safety and someone else's feelings, and they're constantly told that only bitches put themselves first, and at 1am in an elevator with a big guy you don't know, well, your feelings aren't gonna be her priority.

A guy ran up and asked for any cash so his friend could eat who hadn't eaten in days. It felt off but I had 3 bucks on me and, if he was telling the truth, it'd get him a cheeseburger. So I gave it to him and he ran off, idk if he got the food. My girl rolled her eyes and said I need to stop believing homeless people asking for cash (this isn't a habit, I just happened to have a little cash i didn't specifically need) and I told her I really don't like lying and saying I don't have cash. So this got me wondering: is it okay to lie to homeless people about having cash when you think they're just trying to get drug/alcohol money? I'd still feel bad for assuming they weren't legit people needing food.\n\nEdit: Holy hell y'all blew this up. I appreciate the responses! I always try to help people when I can but I'm a college student and extra cash isn't readily available to me lol.",

            "I talk quite often with homeless people. \n\nWe talk about various subjects, e.g. the weather, their day or mine, their dog if they have one, life in general or I sometimes check in on them - if the weather is particularly hot or cold or they look like someone who needs it.\n\nMost of them are actually really nice people who just don't fit our society for whatever reason. I don't always give away money, sometimes I just shake my head or say \"sorry not today\". \n\nBut one thing I know:  I myself don't always spend wisely and when I hand it over, it's theirs.  I believe that all people act based on one rationale or another - not always a wise one - but I will not and cannot dictate or judge how they spend their money cause I will never know their full story.",
            "I live close to many homeless. I cannot possibly give to everyone of them. So, I go with my gut. If for some reason I feel it. Maybe the look in their eyes, whatever it may be. And of course, if I've got cash on me. Each situation is different. Do what you can, when you can. Thanks for asking a question like this. We can feel so uncomfortable when not knowing what to say or do.",
            "If you're concerned about them being legit just get them food. I've been feeding the homeless for about 2 weeks, And it's been an eye-opening experience. They're just people. Who are unloved and unwanted and undesired in society. Is certainly takes a toll on your psyche to be put in that situation. Certainly some just want drugs or alcohol, It's how a lot of them got into that situation, but some genuinely do want a meal.",
            "\"Sorry not today\" Is what I usually go with. \n\nI'll give someone a dollar sometimes if I have one but I haven't carried cash this decade. \n\nIt's not like you'll solve the homeless problem out of your own pocket.",

            "**Top three beggar lines I get hit with monthly:**  \n\\- I ran out of gas. My (truck, car, motorcycle) is right over there. I don't have any money. I just need a little cash to get home.  \n\\- My buddy hasn't eaten in (insert number of days). I'm trying to get him a meal.  \n\\- I'm trying to get money so I can take my (dog/cat/bird/chinchilla) to the vet. He's right over there laying down. He's the only thing I've got in this world.\n\nGet proactive. Find an organization that really helps and volunteer some time with them. It will change your perspective as to who really needs help and who's trying to fleece you. It's still a challenge, but you'll see the world differently.",
            "I work with the homeless population and have had friends and family that were homeless. \n\nIf you want to give them money, do it. Don\u2019t police how they use their \u201cgift\u201d. Typically when people give them cash and I assume you as well, it\u2019s pocket money. that you probably wouldn\u2019t even notice if it fell out of your pocket on the couch. \nIf you give them cash it has to be with the assumption they may use it for drugs and alcohol. \nAt that point when I give them money, it\u2019s not my money anymore - it\u2019s theirs and they can decide how to spend their money as they please. They are grown and can make their decisions. \nI don\u2019t really mind. \nMost people I know have drank and done some form of drug before, so i\u2019m not going to sit on some moral high ground that poor people don\u2019t deserve to do that\u2026 especially when you give them 1-5$ they aren\u2019t getting much with that. Living on the streets is hard and just like a lot of people, they may turn to drugs or alcohol at times (how often do you hear \u201cman this was a rough week I can\u2019t wait to go home and have a beer / smoke\u201d or something to that effect? it\u2019s a pretty human reaction to have to stress and hardship) \n\nIf you don\u2019t feel comfortable giving cash but want to help out, you can always give them a water, bag of chips / nuts etc, hand sanitizer, baby wipes, socks etc. \nIf they ask for cash and you don\u2019t want to give or don\u2019t have any just say \u201csorry not today\u201d or something\u2026. unless the person is very unwell they usually say ok and keep moving.",
            "I was once leaving an ATM and I had a homeless guy ask me for money. I asked him if he had change for a $20. We just stared at each other for a few a seconds and then I walked away.",
            "Just say \"no\", I always say \"I got nothing\" which is just short for \"I've got nothing for you\". Don't stick around to listen to the story, just keep walking while saying whatever your version of no is",
            "If I give money to a homeless person, I do so knowing that they may or may not spend it on food, clothes, or other essentials.\n\nAnd once I give them the money it\u2019s none of my damn business what they do with it. If they want to go get high, then I can\u2019t blame them; I\u2019d probably want to get high, too.",
            "Having recently been homeless myself, I can tell you that besides from the harshness of living like that, the absolute worst thing about it, is that most people assume that you're some kind of villain that lies, steals, cheats, does drugs and that you have probably always been like that. Really makes it hard to see kindly on mankind, even if you really want to.\n\nSo my advice is to give if and when you feel like it, and keep your money if you feel like that. And saying \"sorry, can't help\" is perfectly legitimate.\nBut don't assume that you can read minds, or that all homeless people are the same.",
            "Either you\u2019re worried about the $3 or you\u2019re not. You\u2019re not under any obligation to give anyone anything.",
            "My personal philosophy is that if I get a chance to show someone that they\u2019re valuable, I will. I\u2019m not naive, but I choose to assume the best in people. \n\nThat said, I don\u2019t carry cash and will be honest about that, but offer that I can buy coffee or something similar if that doesn\u2019t stretch my boundaries too far. Back when I used transit often, I\u2019d keep a spare bus pass with funds on it. When cash or food wasn\u2019t easily available people seemed to appreciate it.",
            "Hi. I work in homeless services.\n\nWhen someone asks for money, I typically tell them I \"just have my card on me, sorry, but I hope you find what you need.\" Sometimes they'll follow up by asking me to go in and get them something, and if I don't want to or can't, I just say \"can't do that right now.\" It's okay to have boundaries with your money with folks on the streets as with everyone else.\n\nThat said, it's indeed true that sometimes people on the streets take the money given to them for \"food\" and use it on other things. A lot of people put conditions on their donations and get angry when those conditions aren't fulfilled. I offer you all a different perspective: sure, they may not use it on food like you hoped, but they WILL use it on something that will help them get through the day. It's tough enough being on the streets. If a Bootlegger will help dull the senses, who cares?\n\nWhen you donate, donate knowing it can be used for anything or don't donate at all. If you'd like to help another way, keep supplies in your car or get familiar with the resources in your area and share that information. You'd be surprised how many people don't know what services they can access.",
            "Crackheads used to stop people coming out of a restaurant I worked at years ago. It was a cash only place, so pretty much a sure thing that people had cash on them.\n\nThey always had something they needed money for. Most common was can you spare 5 or 10 bucks for gas. They supposedly ran out of gas far enough away that you couldn't see the car. Sometimes they'd add that they were going to a job or picking up their kids for added sympathy. My favorite when they did the gas thing was I'd say, \"Dude! It's your lucky day. I just filled up a 5 gallon container of gas for my lawnmower. It's in my trunk right overthere. I'll drive you to your car and we can put the gas in. They'd just be dumbfounded. Saying crap like,\" umm but I need the 10 bucks for gas.\" Yeah man I got the gas right here. It was just funny watching their faces after I said I had gas in my trunk. They literally didn't know what else to say because I went off script.",
            "I never bother to try and differentiate the legit from the lies, it's beside the point. If I have the extra cash, I hand it on over, and I usually make a comment about them not needing to justify their need to me, a stranger. If I don't have the extra cash, I apologize and say I'm pretty broke rn, and sometimes offer a cigarette instead.\n\nThe way I see it, if they need money bad enough that they had to resort to begging strangers for it, they can just have some of mine. I don't care if they spend it on food or crack, the money belongs to them once I've made the choice to give it. If you don't wanna hand over the money they ask for with no strings attached, a polite \"sorry, don't have any cash\" is all that needs to happen. We have no right to interrogate them over their intentions or demand they buy certain things with the money we choose to give them. Give freely or just don't bother, because those folks have enough problems without weirdos demanding they dance for their dinner.",
            "Most of the time giving them money isn\u2019t going to help them long term. Donate to soup kitchens, homeless shelters and places that specifically help people like that. Also brush up on what resources your city has for the homeless.",
            "Having been homeless before, its actually not hard to stay full in America if that is really your concern. From white boxes, to churches and the dumpsters across the country- there is always free food somewhere. \n\nAnd yes, its ok to lie back at people.who are lying to you. The three bucks was for a fix, not food.",
            "I live in Germany. People can get welfare over here. If a native speaker is begging, money is not his main problem. \n\nI work in a school for adults and most of our customers live of welfare. Its not fun but they manage.",
            "Have you read that story about the father who advocates for doing good recklessly? If someone says they\u2019re hungry and you have the means to help them, help them. It\u2019s good to assume the best when it\u2019s not hurting you to assist them. \n\nAnd if he was lying? Jokes on him. **He\u2019s** the asshole, but you did your kind deed for the day.",
            "All homeless charities say you should not give them cash. If you\u2019re concerned you can contact the relevant charity or authority to get them help.\n\nI started doing the above, and I was shocked to find out that every person I had referred was already known to the charities and already had assistance and/or a home.",
            "I usually give people a small amount of cash if I have it. I generally believe them that they are hungry, and even if I didn't, I think it is ok for poor people to sometimes have alcohol or drugs, just like other people",
            "If someone is outside a fast food place I will buy them food, as much as they want, but otherwise I don\u2019t usually carry cash. \n\nSame would go if someone asked me specifically for hygiene or comfort items. I would happily buy them.",

            "Your girlfriend is right. I live in a downtown area with plenty of homeless, so I interact them almost daily. Many cities and organization already providing them with hot meals, so nobody is staving to death. He most likely lied to you when he said he hasn't eaten in 3 days. Sometimes I walk around and see huge plates full of uneaten food next to homeless people who beg for money\n\nMost homeless people in my area have some substance abuse issue and are looking for cash for purchasing alcohol and drugs",
            "So, here a couple ways to look at this.  \n\n\nPerspective 1:  \nSo for a number of years I was a rent-a-cop, and I worked graveyards at a couple of different sites. I got to know some of the local homeless folks. Mostly my job was to send them packing, with alacrity. If I could not convince them to mosey under their own power I would be required to involve local law enforcement to further encourage them.  \nSo one Christmas Morning about 2 AM, I see a regular leaned right up against the front glass in a seated position. Its cold AF so I assume hes trying to get the heat from inside the building. I Asked him, has he eaten today... he said \"no\". Asked him if he was hungry, he said \"yes\". I went back to my office and heated up the entire Christmas dinner my fiance had brought me, two heaping plates of amazing family style chow, and brought it out to him. Told him I would be back by in a bit, and just leave the plates on this bench. I'll pick them back up.\n\nLater I came back, the dude stole the knife and fork, splattered the food across the glass and shattered the plates. I was beyond angry at that point.\n\nAfter that, it got a lot easier to do the \"bum rush\" part of my job.\n\n  \nPerspective 2:  \nSeveral months later, I was taking my mom out for brunch. At an intersection in this same town GUESS WHO came running up the passenger side of the truck begging for cash. Mom opened up her wallet and gave the guy cash, right on the spot. It was easy to see shes an old lady and there was MORE cash in the wallet. I was worried my mom was getting scammed like this on the regular, and that she was making a target of her self. I told her this, but did not tell her I know this guy. I said, he's just going to blow that money on terrible booze.  She said to me, \"Well, I at least know that I personally tried to help him in a way I could, that I gave him the CHOICE of a hot meal or not... I gave him that power today. Besides... if my best outcome for the day was to sleep in a shelter instead of a storm drain somewhere... I'd probably want a bottle of cheap whiskey myself.\"  \n\n\nSo either way, it's a complex issue. IT really depends on what your personal expectations for outcomes are. Today, many years later... I will give homeless folks a couple of bucks if I have it on me. Further, I'm not really the \"rob me\" type. I have flat begged my wife to never roll down her windows or get out of the car if she even things there is a chance of a bum near her. Again, too much experience from the rent-a-cop days, none of it good... and for the most part I think she humors me.  \n\n\nFor yourself, you need to judge the short-term and long-term risk/reward. You simply do not know what the bum is getting out of it. You know what YOU expect to get out of it. So, \"to thine own self be true\" and to hell with the opinions of others.",

            "The best way is just to not engage. Don't say anything and just keep walking. You don't owe them an explanation or money.   \nIf you're a soft touch and want to give them a few dollars, then keep a few spare bucks in your pocket so you can whip it out quickly and pass it over, while still moving without engaging. You don't want to stop and pull out your wallet in front of an unknown person who may be desperate or dangerously psychotic.",

            "Last time I went to Chicago for a concert this happened to me too. I was walking from my hotel to the gas station for some snacks. Homeless dude came up asking for food for money. I rarely ever have cash so I told him I would grab him something from the station. I got my stuff and grab a $6 pre-made sub and a water for him. Gave it to him on the way out, told I'd been Where's been and it can certainly get better (he told me about a drug problem) and keep his head up.\n\nWay I look at it this. If I can afford a concert in another state that I drive 3 hours to get to, a hotel, and everything that comes with not being home (eating, drinking, gas for travel, etc) I can afford to be a decent human being and help someone when I can.

Factor in mental health issues, substance abuse and a genuine lack of resources and it makes a portable nightmare.

Most (as in overwhelming majority) homeless people are dual diagnosis, which means they suffer from both substance abuse and mental health issues. It's just reality.\n\nDonating your money to a homeless charity is like flushing it down the toilet. Where I live, nobody except for people like us are helping the homeless; there's no non-profit down there feeding them and giving them tents and clothes and whatever. The city doesn't do shit to help them. The only help they get is from regular people from the community trying to make a difference. Fuck homeless charities.\n\nMake your own decisions.

And basically the person cooking it was having a hard time getting it in the water because it kept trying to push the lid away and get away from the water. They finally just smashed the legs with the lid so it withdrew it's claw and then it was fully submerged so obviously it wasn't able to push the lid after that. It died shortly after I assume, but it was still hard watching them try to get away before the lid finally closed.",

            "It's completely understandable to have concerns about this practice, given the intuitive discomfort many of us might feel. Now, let's get into the science of it.\n\nFirst, it's important to know that crabs and lobsters belong to a group of animals called invertebrates, specifically a subgroup called arthropods. They have a very different nervous system from us mammals. Their nervous system is more decentralized than ours, and it doesn't include a brain in the way we understand it. Instead, they have ganglia, which are clusters of nerve cells, distributed throughout their bodies.\n\nNow, the central question is whether these creatures experience pain or suffering when they're boiled alive. Pain perception in such organisms is still a subject of active scientific debate. Some researchers suggest that crustaceans, such as crabs and lobsters, may experience a sensation analogous to pain, while others argue that their nervous systems are not complex enough for the subjective experience of suffering.\n\nThe principal argument against crustaceans feeling pain is based on their nervous system's simplicity. Some scientists argue that the experience of pain requires a level of cognitive processing that these animals likely do not possess.\n\nOn the other hand, some studies have shown that crustaceans exhibit avoidance behavior to harmful stimuli, which could be indicative of a pain-like experience. However, this is not definitive evidence of experiencing pain as we understand it because it could be a simple, reflexive response without the conscious perception of distress.\n\nIn summary, the scientific community does not have a consensus on whether crustaceans like crabs and lobsters can actually experience pain. Therefore, the reaction to their method of preparation often varies based on individual perceptions and beliefs about animal welfare. However, alternatives to boiling live crustaceans are increasingly being proposed and practiced, such as stunning or chilling the animals to insensibility before cooking.\n\nIt's a fascinating topic that continues to be researched and certainly opens up important discussions about ethical food practices.",

A lot of TV shows and movies have done the same. \n\nBut yes, they're iconic/popular and I think even though it's been 20+ years since 9/11, they're always going to be well-known.",
            "The twin towers were almost synonymous with New York City. In movies, photos, books, etc if they were included somehow you would immediately have a sense of place even without mentioning the character was in New York, even if you knew next to nothing about the US you knew the WTC and the Twin Towers. They say over 400 movies featured the Twin Towers in some way.\n\nI see lots of posts here with people trivializing them as just big block buildings, or not that important until after 9/11, you guys are just wrong or you are trolling. If you lived in the tri state area, when those buildings came down it was like someone ripped our collective beating hearts out of our chests. They were two buildings out of a larger grouping known as the World Trade Center, but most people really wouldn't bother recognizing all the other buildings, even after 9/11. No offense to anyone who lost anybody in WTC 7, but the other buildings were not recognizable or iconic, capturing the hearts and minds of the world. After all, at one point they were the tallest buildings in the world.\n\nSome people are comparing the twin towers to the Eiffel Tower, or the Statue of Liberty, etc while that might be good comparisons, the problem is they are more meaningful than that. Yes Eiffel Tower and Statue of Liberty are iconic, meaningful symbols of the US or France, but WTC was a symbol of US economic power and greatness. Tons of people worked in those buildings, television was broadcast off the top of those buildings, they represented the massive success of America. Yes the Statue of Liberty represents the promise of freedom connected with coming to America or being American. But it is hard to imagine the magnitude, importance, sheer size and volume of these towers without being there, looking out your bedroom window to see them every day, having friends and family going to work in them every day, without understanding the real attraction and importance of NYC overall.\n\nAlso recall they were attacked in 1993 as well as 2001, and after 1993 the political / cultural significance of the WTC definitely increased, we talk about \"never forget\" in terms of 9/11, but those of us who live(d) in the NYC Metro area do not forget 1993 either, and the sense of community which grew surrounding those attacks as well. \n\nI tell you nobody really cares about the new One WTC/Freedom Tower, there just isn't the same emotional attachment to it as the Twin Towers, and I doubt there ever will be. Trump started gaining popularity way before his presidential run when he opined that the twin towers should be rebuilt exactly as before, except with one more floor, just to stick it to \"the terrorists\" and the world. That's really symbolic of the NYC attitude and mindset, and unless you've really been part of that world it's hard to get.",
            "I knew them by photos, but not really by name as much.",
            "They were well known and prominent, but not big tourist attractions.  They were just big, ugly buildings that dominated the skyline.\n\nThe Empire State Building has been the big tourist attraction in NYC since it went up.  Even if it wasn't the tallest, it was a lot prettier and more famous.\n\nThey didn't meet at the top of the World Trade Center in Sleepless in Seattle.",
            "Anyone else who didn't live or visit New York is lying. NO FUCKING BODY KNEW OR CARED beyond it just being a tall building. Was only famous for being in the very beginning of sky scrapper history. But the fact you didn't say their actual names. You know. WORLD TRADE CENTERS. Exposes how much they were cared about outside newyork. It was only sad because a giant structure we mad symbolic with strength and safety was demolished.",
            "I'm going to be honest.  I was an adult who lived most of my life in Arizona at the time, and I had no idea what they were.",
            "New York without the twin towers is like Paris without the Eifel tower, SF without the golden gate bridge or London without big ben and so on.",
            "I'm blown away at how different my opinion is compared to most of the other comments. \nI was about 17 and lived in NJ when the towers fell. In my opinion the twin towers were the most famous buildings in the united states. The tallest buildings in the most famous city in the world- and there were two of them. Along with the statue of liberty, they were the highlight of the NYC skyline. Every movie\\show taking place in NYC featured them in a shot. They were beautiful and projected power. The tower that replaced them, although beautiful in its own right, does not even come close.",
            "i was 13 and didnt know what they were until that day. i had seen them, i knew they were some iconic buildings, but never knew really what they were outside of a few tangential references",
            "The first spiderman trailer had him swinging between the towers, they had to cut that from the movie for obvious reasons",
            "That\u2019s actually part of the 9/11 memorial museum, there\u2019s a section with news and advertisements and tv shows, etc that featured or mentioned the twin towers.",
            "Very famous, made more so by the piece of guerrilla art where a man illegally tight rope walked between them (if you're interested there's a documentary movie called *Man on Wire*). I was 10 when they came down and living in rural England and I'd heard of them.",
            "Outside of popular culture, it was a very important landmark for finance, since it was close to the NY stock exchange and housed mostly financial and finance service firms. With NY being the center of the financial firm, even more then then today.",
            "Slightly off topic  but if you're interested I recommend watching [Man On Wire](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1155592/) (2008) about French high-wire walker Philippe Petit who illegally wire-walked between the Twin Towers just as they were nearing completion in 1974.\n\nThen watch [The Walk](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3488710/) (2015), the dramatization of Petit's achievement",
            "I was in high school in Ohio - I had no idea what they were before 9-11. I had never been to NYC at that age. The Empire State building was probably a more familiar landmark. The towers were frequently shown in movies in establishing shots of NYC, though that was something I only noticed later.",
            "There used to be a pretty pricey restaurant at the top called windows of the world. I mean touch screens in the 90s and as fancy as it could get. \n\nI'd think it was pretty \"famous\". It was a massive business building/monument not a just monumental building. \nNow it's just a monument. \n\nSad. \n\n\nRIP 9/11 victims.",
            "I have been to NY once. Went up one of the towers (there was an observation floor for tourism). Also went to the Empire state bldg and Statue of Liberty on that trip. The twin towers were famous as a destination. \n\nYou know how movies show a skyline of the city they supposedly take place in? It was a key identifier. When you saw those twin towers at the start of a movie, you knew it was NYC. Sadly, right after the attacks many movies were altered to remove the twin towers or change the scene outright.\n\nThere were 4 planes used. The terrorists went for what they believed were the best American targets. They chose the White House, the Pentagon, and 2 WTC buildings. I'm sure they spent a lot of time thinking and rethinking their targets. Yeah, the WTC buildings were pretty famous on the world scene.",
            "It wasn't really something that we talked about at all, but you'd see them on tv and stuff.",
            "I was born and raised in Southern California and the planes hit when I was 12 years old. I knew exactly what they were and where they were. \n\nThe Twin Towers AKA The World Trade Center was in fact, world famous. Just watch any NY based movie pre-2001. The Twin Towers are almost always present in some fashion in some kind of flyover as the backdrop. \n\nThe Twin Towers maybe weren't as famous as the Empire State Building, but they were close.",
            "I lived in NYC for 40 years from late 70\u2019s to a couple years ago.   They were incredibly prominent, anchored the area.   It was a big fucking deal",
            "As a NYer, the towers were a landmark that could easily be seen anywhere within the 5 boroughs and in parts of NJ. \n\nYou could get off the train (usually by climbing to street level from underground) and quickly get your bearings by looking for the towers. \n\nThat\u2019s the part I miss the most. \n\nI watched the towers fall from the furthest point in Brooklyn (Mill Basin) - there are further points but not really residential. I could see the towers while kayaking in Jamaica Bay. Driving from JFK airport or from Long Island there was a part of the highway in Brooklyn where it suddenly comes into view. \n\nThere\u2019s was nothing more exciting for me to be driving in New Jersey and hit that point on the highway (or driving across the GWB) where lower Manhattan and the Towers suddenly came into view - because it meant you were almost home. \n\nYou can still see the city at those points but my brain always goes to \u201cit\u2019s missing.\u201d\n\nAlso consider the pop culture references. \n\nDuring the King Kong remake, Kong climbs the Twin Towers and not the Empire State Building. \n\nThere was supposed to be a scene in a Spider-Man film where he catches a helicopter in a web spun across the two towers. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/yzha4kUowf4",
            "Iconic. The Manhattan skyline with the Twin Towers was one of 4-5 standard establishing shots for movies set in NYC for about 30 years.",
            "I was 11 and I'm from the UK but I had never heard of them.",
            "They weren't. That was their big break",
            "Brit here. I was 18 when 9/11 happened.\n\nI knew that there was a building called the World Trade Centre in New York and I remember news of the 1993 bombing, but I wouldn't have been able to pick it out on a photo of the Manhattan skyline. In fact I was surprised to learn that the WTC consisted of two separate towers. I only found this out when the 9/11 attack took place. What I previously thought was the WTC was actually the UN building.\n\nThis is just my own experience as a non American. I never really took an interest in New York buildings. I didn't know that the Chrysler building and the Empire State were two different buildings until I was in my mid twenties.",
            "Good question. From the answers in here, I agree that most of the US got to know them through Hollywood after 1973. Ex: The opening scene of Barney Miller, Men in Black, Home Alone, The Butchers Wife...etc. There are more than I can remember. As someone who toured the towers before they opened and worked in them almost until the first bombing in the underground parking lot. I wept on that day for the lives and the memories.\n\nHere is something I haven't read in here. If you worked in or visited the streets of Manhattan, you could always use the twin towers as your landmark for direction as they could be seen from any street, certainly Central Park South and below. Also, there was a television transmission antenna on the north tower that (in the day) if you aimed your TV antenna at it from anywhere in the city, you had perfect reception. The towers provided so much office space, they were never fully occupied in their history. Rest in Peace, WTC."

It's not to be underestimated. It takes over people, because it's such a good thing for a short while. It's like living your best mental version of yourself, but leaves you wrecked like a race car afterwards. Anytime the cure to the problem, is more of the problem causing cure, it creates a devastating feedback loop.\n\nTL;DR\nMeth is like plugging your brain in vs running on battery.  Not to be fucked with. Professionals beware.",

            "I had a coworker I worked with that overcame her meth addiction of 4+ years. One day she was telling me all the crazy stuff in the past that did while she was high on meth. I asked her what lead her to try meth in the first place and what did it feel like when you did try it? She told me she had been in a car accident and hurt her back. She was experiencing severe back pain for months on end and *unsurprisingly* her doctor had over prescribed her pain pills. She said the day came when the doctor wouldn\u2019t refill her pain pills and that she was in excruciating pain. Her boyfriend had been doing meth for some time but she wouldn\u2019t ever partake with him. He had never pressured or even ask her to do it with him. He would do it in another room away from her. After her pain pills ran out, her bf said that the meth would take all her pain away if she didn\u2019t want to hurt anymore. She thought trying it once couldn\u2019t cause her to become addicted to it. But she was wrong. She said it felt like when you go over a big drop on a roller coaster and you feel butterflies in your stomach. And then it feels like a warm bath covering every inch of your body as all your troubles seem to disappear. You just feel high on life. But you never feel the same high as you do that first time. Which is why it\u2019s so addictive. It took her losing everything in her life and becoming a convicted felon to get clean. But I am so proud of the person she is and that she overcame that dark period in her life. It is never too late to turn your life around.",

            "Meth makes you feel like a God. If you have any type of pre-existing mental illness, particularly personality disorders, it gives you everything you ever wanted: confidence, sex appeal, wisdom, the best and most compelling words, motivation, readiness. It'll make you say yes to anything mildly appealing to you... things you've subconsciously denied yourself from (most likely wisely). This lasts until you've experienced all the good it can bring, and that happens very quickly after you first consume it. From there, it's definitely a quick fall but it still tricks you into being excited about the world of good it can bring to you. Basically, from the minute you try it to the minute you hate yourself because of it, it treats you well. Once you've introduced yourself, you feel like its slave. Even after the romance wears off you want it. Meth is the partner, the parent, the person you always wanted to be.  It seduces you quickly and lets you hang on until you're all out. So, in short, meth gives you an insanely good feeling and then you're all out of happy juices so you fall and crash only to realize you've burned all your bridges and spent all your casino money.",
            ">how people end up trying it in the first place. \n\nI can only offer an anecdotal story, but my ex got laced when she was offered weed. She was smoking out of a bong with an arab man twice her age, and hes like \"here try this\" without telling her what he put in. Next thing you know shes smoking meth. Then its \"try snorting it, its better\" and then \"try injecting it, it's better.\"",
            "In a nutshell, there are a bunch of different reasons people try drugs, other than allure or cool factors.\n\n1. Their friends are doing it, and they want to belong.\n2. They want to get high to get away from other problems.\n3. They intend to have sex, and drugs+sex is a really fun combination.\n4. They'd rather do something else, but couldn't find it.\n5. They'd rather do something else, but couldn't afford it.\n\nFor meth in particular though, my experience with tweekers has been that for every one guy who maybe works regularly and does it a couple times a year for fun, but still has his shit generally together, there are at least 1000 tweekers who are falling apart, both metaphorically and literally (teeth coming out and gross stuff), who believe themselves to still be functional even though they most definitely are not.\n\n1-800-662-4357 is the number for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Hotline (US, open 24/7/365). If you have any question in your mind whether or not you should call that number, you absolutely should. It isn't too late. People do still care about you, even some who keep you at arms length to protect themselves. You deserve to be healthy and happy, and you can do this.",
            "Well, if you do all though other drugs enough, they won't really do anything for you. Your body gets use to it.\n\nPersonally, I think people do meth because they're desperate to get a good high after doing everything else. But at that point you'd be going too far",

            "The DARE program really did a number on you if you think the only possible motivation to do drugs is to look cool. \n\nI have never been motivated to do meth, but I would imagine the biggest motivator is just \"to get high.\" I'm not sure you're quite thinking like a drug addict if your only argument is \"there are *cooler* ways to get high.\"\n\nEdit: specifically, socially. If you think \"other people will think I'm cool for doing drugs\" that's really not the motivation.",

Win win, right?\n\nMeth is almost as cheap as dirt nowadays and readily available, so why buy expensive harder-to-find prescription drugs second hand? And once you try it, it takes hold like no other drug I\u2019ve ever experienced. It\u2019s honestly the only drug I would tell someone to not try, even once.",
            "Blue collar physical labor is very exhausting and they work you like a rented mule.\n\nIf you don't do blue collar work and never have, you can't understand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's usually set up like you \\*can't\\* survive on a standard 40 at your pay grade, so 50-60 hours is a lot more common.  No man past 30 has enough energy to give 50-60 hours of hard physical work to an employer naturally.\n\nAll things considered, meth is very cheap and is by far the longest lived stimulant.  One dose has you running at triple speed and overjoyed....  BUT one hit or line too much and you feel like your heart is gonna burst, you have a thundering headache, and you can't sleep at all for 24 hours.  It's really hard to find the sweet spot sometimes.\n\n100 bucks a week can usually keep a seasoned meth head happy and that comes out far cheaper than most hard drugs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo I approve?  Fuck no.  I personally hate the sensation despite trying it a few times.    And if you're in a such a situation where meth is required to deal with your hard physical workload, you're being exploited and should quit your job.  Even if meth is keeping you so fired up you can keep up with the workload running like that will break anyone's back in 20 years.  Permanent physical damage.",

            "You seem to be misinformed about some of the effects of meth, which are different and affect in varied degrees depending on the quality, quantity, and the individual who does it. Homelessness, prostitution, and gangsters all existed long before meth did and go back as far as the existence of civilized society. People who have never done meth become homeless all the time and it has nothing to do with meth or even drugs at all. Homelessness is the result of financial crisis more than anything. Prostitution has more to do with financial issues as well, such as an attraction to easy money or desperate times calling for desperate measures. The attraction to meth is probably the energetic feeling, the sociability and elevated mood, the fact that there is little to no withdrawal from meth compared to cocaine or opiates, and the fact that it's affordable and easy to be a functioning meth user if done moderately. It also helps people lose weight which is why its available by prescription to patients who are obese. Its not like doctors prescribe methamphetamine and the obese become prostitutes or gangsters. It is simply a matter of the individual and their ability to effectively moderate its use. Not everyone ends up in a ditch, toothless and picking at their faces. Those who do would have probably ended up that way anyway, just from something else.",
