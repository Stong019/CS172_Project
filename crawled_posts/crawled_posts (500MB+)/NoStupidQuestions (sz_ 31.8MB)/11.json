            "The Supreme Court ruled movie studios owning movie theaters as a violation of antitrust laws in the case of [US vs Paramount](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Paramount_Pictures,_Inc.). \n\nI suppose he could technically use a 3rd party studio, but I doubt the DOJ would let Bazos circumvent this law so blatantly. Amazon already cuts it a little close with antitrust laws, so I can't imagine he'd want to tempt the DOJ like that.\n\nAlso, whatever theater did this would be putting themselves out of business. None of the major studios (or even the smaller ones) would show their movies at that theater again.\n\nEdit: Did not expect this many responses, but I should state I'm not any kind of antitrust expert. I'd be interested to hear from someone who knew more.\n\nA lot of you are saying that a theater making 3 billion would for sure take this deal. Obviously, if Bezos is handing out $3 billion theaters would line up, but I'm working under the assumption that Bezos is trying to get this money back.\n\nAnother common response is that he could do this outside the US. That seems a lot more feasible. I'm assuming most major movie markets have similar laws in place, or in the case of China have limits on international screenings. If he went to a country with a less developed film industry he could probably avoid this law, however.",

Business had been slow, he did not had the money to pay the baker for his guest's breakfast bread for some days now, he owed him 100$.\n\nThe baker takes the money from the hotel owner, and runs down the street to the coal retailer. Business had also been slow, he did not had the money to pay for his oven's coal this week. The baker owed the coal retailer 100$.\n\nThe coal retailer takes the money, and runs to the cabaret. Not many people had been buying his coal, he did not had the money to pay for the prostitute's services last night, and she was not happy about that. She was owed 100$.\n\nThe prostitute takes the money, and runs up the street again. She owed 100$ to the hotel owner for using his rooms to receive her clients for a couple of nights,  but they had not paid her yet, so she was also low on cash.\n\nThe owner gets the money just in time for the guest to come back from his inspection. \"I don't like the rooms, give me my money back\".

            "Depends on the situation\n\nIf you're taking their door simply because your kid wanted alone time, sleeps with the door closed, or you're worried they're masturbating so you take their door, thats abusive bullshit. \n\nI had to have my door removed for a few months when I got home from the mental ward after a suicide attempt, for my own safety. I got it back after a few months of improvement thru therapy.",
            "My dad did this to my sister and me when I was 14 and she was 16. There was no reason for it; he was just sick of us \"living behind closed doors all the time.\" (Spoiler: we stayed in our rooms with the door shut because dad was an asshole.) My sister didn't mind as much because her room was on the first floor, away from my parents' room. But my room was in a much less secluded area of the house and right next to my parents' room, so I was never alone.\n\nI lasted a week before I went to to my mom and bawled my eyes out with my head in her lap. That really freaked her out, so she demanded that the doors be put back on.\n\nUnless there's a VERY good reason to take your child's door away, don't fucking do it. It's dehumanizing, abusive, and psychologically damaging.",

            "I had no idea this was even a thing until the last few years. It wasn't even a consideration while growing up. I'm one of five kids who grew up in a small house. I assume my parents were grateful that we fucked off to our own rooms and out of their way, and can't imagine they'd sacrifice their own peace by going open plan. If you're making structural changes to exert control you've gone seriously wrong somewhere.",

            "IMO it\u2019s important that kids have THEIR space.",
            "It is 1000% toxic for a parent to take away their child's door.\n\nStrict parents make sneaky children. All this will do is teach the child 1) their parents do not trust them 2) how to lie / conceal things better.\n\nEdit: responding to the 'what about' crowd below.\n\nThe only instances I can think of where removing a door wouldn't do more harm then good may be situations like self harm, drug addiction, severe mental health issues, etc (not suggesting I actually would in that situation or that is a good idea). In those instances, I would still only remove a door at a recommendation from my child's care team. \n\nIf you take away a child's only safe space it could just as easily exacerbate the issue as help solve it.\n\nI'm not a mental health professional so I don't know if they would ever recommend this course of action. Just saying that recommendation world be the only time I would consider it.",
            "Growing up, I've seen parents do some straight up stupid shit. Taking doors down, locking kids in the room, beating/slapping as a form of punishment, and berating them in front of everyone at school.\n\nThe bottom line is this: some people just aren't meant to be parents and the child already has an uphill battle at a good life.\n\n\"You need a license to drive a car. Hell, you need a license to fish. But any asshole can be a parent.\"\n\nNot the exact quote, but felt it was pertinent here.",
            "Depends on what the kid did/is doing. I had a friend who was addicted to Xanax in high school and nearly ODed in his room. Also did a bunch of other drugs in there. I can\u2019t really blame his mom for taking the door",
            "I think it heavily depends on why the door is taken and if they're given something else for privacy. If the parent takes the door just because they can or as punishment for something unrelated to the door itself, that's toxic. However if the parent took the door because it was being slammed after repeatedly asking the child not to slam the door and put up a curtain instead, that's reasonable because it stops the problem of slamming the door but still allows the child some privacy.",
            "Depends on a lot of factors.\n\nIt's not toxic if the child is a baby, for instance. It's also not toxic in the example another poster gave, where it was replaced with a privacy curtain to prevent them from slamming it repeatedly.\n\nIt's extremely toxic if it's to ensure that a child has no privacy when they're old enough to want it, except in extreme circumstances.",
            "Depends on the situation. I'm assuming most are talking about teens. However I did it to my young son at the age of 5 or 6. He would slam his door in my face and his siblings and there were times they got hurt including myself. I took his door down until he understood this was not a behavior that was acceptable. It took about a week.If he was angry I would give him space and not invade it but as a parent I also need to be respected. Haven't had an issue since. \n\nTaking his door was the right thing for this instance and I stand behind it.",
            "I used to think 100% toxic. \n\nUntil I had a teenager who would constantly slam her door over and over every time she was upset or frustrated. It was absolutely terrible and terrified my other children when she did it. It wasn't just once in a fit of anger - it was over and over and over. I warned her several times that if she kept slamming her door like that she would lose the door. I had to take it from her but have her a privacy curtain and still let her have privacy to her room. That lasted about a month and when she showed some positive change she got her door back. I can happily say she no longer slams her door. So I think it all depends on the reasoning.",
            "Generally yes. I did take my sons door away when he went through a streak of slamming it anytime he got upset. He'd broken the door jam and the handle by that point, and we'd had enough. He got it back when he stopped with the tantrums though. Privacy is important for everyone.",
            "I would consider taking the door for a few days if the kids develop a habit of slamming them and don\u2019t respond to verbal requests to stop. However I\u2019d put up a curtain in the doorway for privacy and still ask before entering.",

Removing the door definitely made him stop smoking weed in the house but we would just drive around the neighborhood and smoke weed instead. Not sure it really helped the problem but I wouldn\u2019t describe it as toxic. He\u2019s a healthy person and doesn\u2019t seem to have issues with privacy. I think it\u2019s 100% dependent on the situation. I wouldn\u2019t say it ALWAYS toxic.",
            "Absolutely. Children are still people and people are entitled to a modicum of privacy.",
            "I've been a mother to 3 for over 26 years. Had my share of frustrating parenting moments but never would I do this. Closing your bedroom door means you're in your own safe zone! Everyone needs that mentally. \n It's a personal environment regardless who is paying the rent!  So many different alternatives for punishments. Even for the kids who slam doors.",

            "My son lost his door because he put a giant hole in it. My other son is getting a lock on his door to keep siblings out.  \nI think it totally depends on the situation",
            "Context is always important, and perspectives are different. My wife and I took off the doors to ours kids' rooms. But context: we have 4 children under 4. The doors off means they can't be closed and muffle the sound of crying or screaming. The door off means they can't lock each other out and fight about that (our oldest learned how to lock her door at 2). The door off means no pinching of curious fingers near the hinged side, or no heads slammed by closing doors.\n\nWe also intend on putting the doors back when they're a little bit older (maybe another year or two) because having privacy is important and having \"their space\" is important.",
            "Yes unless it is warranted. If a child is suicidal, destructive, cuts themselves, ruins their property, or things like that I believe it is warranted. And only because you're trying to make sure the child physically doesn't hurt themselves. Other than that it's a complete invasion of privacy.",
            "As a dad - IMO, yes\n\n **unless** there is some objective rationale to not trust your kid with their own health and safety or that of others (prior drug use, cyber-bullying other kids, older sibling trying to get younger sibling to try drugs, etc. ). But it would have to be substantial to justify removing doors.",
            "I see a lot of \u201cmy house my rules\u201d parents out there and honestly the experience for the child not only becomes toxic, it becomes hostile. You\u2019re made to feel you don\u2019t have a home and you\u2019re just living in someone else\u2019s with zero human rights. It\u2019s akin to being in jail imo. You can\u2019t take away someone\u2019s rights just because they live in your house lmao. Especially a child that you brought into this world. They didn\u2019t get a say. They\u2019re not a bum asking a friend for a room. Do you want to see your child naked? Don\u2019t take away the door.",

            "Very. This will end up with mental problems in a future.",
            "Yes obviously, this is insane imo. \n\nI've also never heard about this practice in my country, but reading on reddit it's apparently considered normal parenting among some people? So weirded out o\\_O",
            "Yes",
            "Yes, absolutely.",
            "Absolutely. Everyone has a right for privacy and violating it in such a way is unacceptable",
            "I had this conversation once with a social worker. Basically what it came down to for her is yes, it is usually toxic, but you have to consider all scenarios.\n\nIs this Child/Teen at risk of self harming or had a history of it? There is times that removing a door is in someones best interest of safety and privacy needs to be put aside.",
            "Sometimes. Context is key.\n\nI've never had my door taken, but both my sisters and I have had or door handles removed so we couldn't lock them. It was usually for a few days or a week, combined with increased supervision.\n\nThe rationale for it, as I remember, was that if we couldn't prove we could make good decisions when we were alone, we shouldn't be alone until we learned how to make better decisions.\n\nI lost my handle because at 15 I had two friends over and we got ahold of some booze, drank too much and one friend threw up all over the place, then proceeded to dry heave and cry in the bathroom for over an hour at 2am. It's also when I was taught how to run a Rug Doctor because I recall shampooing the carpets the next day all sweaty, tired, and hung over.",
            "Not automatically.  In most circumstances, yes it's toxic.  However, depending on the age of the child and how egregious their behavior is, it may be acceptable.",
            "I did take my son\u2019s door away for a while because he had a temper tantrum (he was 14) and punched a hole in it. I told him he could have a door when he bought a new one with his allowance. Took about a week, and he\u2019s been able to restrain himself much better ever since.",
            "depends on the reason behind it. just like most things. if you have been caught hiding drugs and alcohol then  maybe it isn't so toxic. if it is because they don't want you to have privacy because they don't like you having privacy then yes. all in all it is a case by case scenario. but i do feel it leans more towards the toxic side of the scale.",
            "Anyone that tries to answer this without asking WHY a parent would do that, has no business butting their nose in on this matter.",
            "I took away the 5-year-olds door when he slammed it one too many times during his tantrums. A little lesson in anger management, and consequences of his actions. It's almost time to return the door, as he hasn't slammed a door in a while. Of course, this wasn't removed due to a trust issue or anything, and he's fully aware why he lost it. I believe it's been a lesson learned.",
            "My sister and I had it done to us,  and honestly... we totally deserved it.   Teenage girl fight... one of us had a broom handle through their door,  the other one a roller skate.   So my parents took away the damaged doors until we could afford to replace them.   \n\nJump ahead a few decades... unaware of the Great Door Fight of '94, my son decided to kick and hit his door in anger,  and the door broke... so broken door removed till he could afford to replace it.   \n\nSo I guess it depends on the reason?  For just a punishment or privacy,  no i don't think i would do it.   But if there is a safety concern like broken wood hole my cats could injure themselves trying to go through,  or if my kids was a danger to himself or others... yeah I would take the door. \n\nSorry,  I know this isn't going to be a well liked response... but safety comes before privacy for me.",
            "It really depends on the context of the situation",
            "Yes. Everyone deserves privacy and likewise my daughter is taught that my room is my space aswell as hers being her own.",
            "My sister lost her door for a week from slamming it one too many times after being warned. Seemed fair to me.",
            "It depends on the reason. If my kids disrespect me there are plenty of ways to punish them without taking down their door. But if they disrespect the door? Slam it, kick it, deface it or otherwise damage it? Then they don't deserve a door anymore. They can hang a curtain or a blanket for privacy .",
            "No if they did something to deserve the door being taken away. Trust goes both ways and the sooner you can teach them about consequences in a controlled environment the better",
            "I think context matters with all forms of punishment. I think if you're ripping your kids door off because they are constantly abusing the privacy of their room and breaking the rules, I think that it *can* be reasonable.\n\n If you're doing it because they talked back, or are staying up all night playing games instead of sleeping, or are slamming their door or locking it and not letting people in, that's pretty dumb. \n\nIf you're doing it because your kid is in there doing drugs, and sneaking out every night and clearly getting into trouble, I'd say that's fair, because then its less about removing their privacy and more about protecting the well being of someone who isn't responsible enough to do it themselves.\n\nI had a close friend in high school who Od'd at a party after sneaking out and was dropped off in the front yard of his house at like 3am. If his sister hadn't heard dogs barking and woke up he would have died. At some point you have to accept that privacy is effecting the well-being of your kid in a negative way and they need to be watched more closely.",
            "Even Timmy's dad knocked.  But he asserted his dominance by coming in anyway",
            "For what reason? Just randomly, yes. Because there is a logical reason why they can't be trusted to be behind a closed door, no.",
            "Yes. Child specialists and mental health workers all say the same thing: privacy is a right, NOT a privilege. Taking away a kids door is borderline abuse.",
            "What's the full story?",
            "Was threatened with I will remove your bedroom door if you slam a door in this house again when I was mad at my parents. No doubt my Dad would have popped those hinges in a heartbeat\u2026.so the warning is effective for that.",
            "My Dad took my sister's bedroom door off because she was a door slammer.. I didn't see that as toxic..",
            "I dunno I took my kids for away when he kept using it as something to slam out of anger. Can't slam a door of it not there",
            "Well, I'm a parent that in fact removed the door from my daughter's room. Little context here, she was 13 and pretty much every time she'd get all pissed off at me (Dad) or her mother for whatever it was that we would have do or hell just breathing...she'd go upstairs to her room and *SLAM* the door to her room. Then you tell her not to slam the door, she'd do it again, this time harder (if that was even possible) than before.\n\nSo, my thoughts at the time....take away the door. \n\nWhen I was popping off the hinges, I remember her telling me, \"you can't do this\", in shear disbelief as I proceeded to take that door down.\n\nIt was off for about 2 days max. Then I put it back on.\n\nShe didn't slam it after that.",
            "My mom did this to my sister when we were kids because she would slam it every time she got upset, only lasted a day and she stopped slamming the door  \ud83d\udeaa",
            "My sister did this recently to her 12 years old but it was for the constant slamming of the door when my niece would get mad.",
            "I had my door removed for 2 weeks when I was in my mid teens. My parents did it because I had an attitude (true) and I kept slamming and locking the door. They gave me fair warning that those actions needed to stop and I called their bluff. Boom. I have a good relationship with both parents and even though I wouldn't do this to my own kids, I don't hold resentment over it. In this case, I deserved it.",
            "Each child takes a different way of parenting. This could work for some and not for others. If it\u2019s for discipline or any other reason. These question are suppose to inspire conversation but they mostly pin ones that agree vs those that disagree. How about we all just come to the understanding that parenting can be tough and sometimes we can all make bad decisions. But as long as we try to do our best for our children that is what matters.",
            "My dad took away my door when I skipped P.E. ONCE to literally finish a school project due that day for Health Class that would be soon after. Actually, I was also banned from my whole ROOM. Only allowed to be in there to sleep in my bed. Make it make sense.",
            "Parent of teenagers here. Also former kid who had her door removed.\n\nI think the temporary removal of a door could possibly be an effective discipline tool if you have a teenager who loves privacy but *also* loves resisting obeying a non-negotiable rule and has so far persevered through first line of defense consequences. \n\nWhen disciplining a child you're not supposed to be *punishing* them, you're supposed to be making complying with the rules relevant to their interests. The discipline is to make further noncompliance an intolerable option. \n\nI'll give a non-door example. When my younger teenager decided to not do any work AT ALL during COVID online school, I made his electronics access a public utility. He had to pay me in classwork completed with a C or better in order to access XBox and cellphone privileges for the day. Sure, he could persist in not doing classwork, but at what cost? So with minimal pushback he did the classwork.\n\nIf you've got a teenager situation that isn't responding to the usual front line consequences (no electronics, no dessert, etc), *temporary* removal of the door can be a non-violent escalation of compliance measures. But only temporary. If you just take the door and make that the new normal (like my parents did), the measure is just meaningless and now your younger brother just spends all his time occupying the bathroom jerking off when there are three other siblings in the house that need to pee. \n\nSo not inherently toxic, but it has to be judiciously applied."

            "I think at this point it's become kind of cliche. I know a lot of kids like some vegetables when they've been lightly steamed with a bit of seasoning, or when they are sauted, roasted, or fried.",
            "Western kids don\u2019t actually hate all vegetables. Tv shows only show certain vegetables being disliked (broccoli and Brussel sprouts mostly). The reason why children hate certain vegetables seems to be cultural. For example in the Pixar movie \u201cInside Out\u201d the American version shows Riley disliking being fed a serving broccoli by her dad but in the Japanese version, they edited the scene to show her upset over bell peppers since Japanese children don\u2019t like those.

            "I'm British and grew up with two brothers, we all hated vegetables when we grew up.\n\nNow I'm older and I've worked as a chef, I can say it's because of how they were cooked/served.\n\nIn England, families tend to just buy a bag of frozen veg and dump it in a pan of hot water till its overcooked and often mushy. Nowadays, we have steamers which are better but I'm the only person I know that even owns a steamer.\n\nThere's also the fact a lot of the time veggies are served as a side dish rather than mixed in with the food like a lot of Asian cooking does. As a kid I loved both Asian and Indian veggie food too but my parents very rarely cooked it and if they did it was done badly. \n\nI personally love Asian and Indian veggie dishes. Its the only reason I could properly manage to go vegetarian because meat free stuff tends to be really bad (quorn) or expensive and harder to get hold of a lot (Linda McCartney).",

I couldn't tell you the number of people I've talked to who grew up being served boiled, unseasoned vegetables by their parents, only to later discover they love the veggies they thought they hated simply because they tasted them cooked by an experienced chef or in a foreign dish. On the flipside, a lot of Asian dishes incorporate veggies into the dishes so they are well-seasoned and flavorful and they don't have the same association.",

Little dude gets excited about raw broccoli and carrots and I rue the day he goes to school and hears other kids talk about how \"gross\" vegetables are. \n\nAt the risk of being offensive, I think it maybe boils down to a lot of adults in the west having a terrible relationship with food, which they pass on to their children. \n\nWe love our veggies in this house, and grow them all around us.

            "This thread makes me realise that the world needs to learn a bit about veggies from Indian cooking. We literally have a different vegetable each meal - french beans, cluster beans, brinjal, okra, pumpkin, all types of gourd, bell peppers, carrots. And different parts of India have widely different ways of cooking them, depending on the base fat (ghee, mustard oil, coconut oil, sunflower oil) and what we call our \"tadka\". We even make a meal out of a curry made of legumes of all kinds!!! I honestly LOVE a wholesome sabzi dal roti rice salad meal. Maybe it has a lot to do with the fact that most homes and kids eat homemade food only. Even though we are moving towards having the more indulgent kind of food more often. But i think all the frying and excess oil is counterproductive since india is basically the heart disease capital of the world. Nevertheless, the flavouring and masala when in moderation makes a meal pretty heartwarming\n\nWe even make veggie maggi lmao, thats basically ramen with veggies. My mom used to make me this whenever i asked for maggi and the request was accepted lol.",

I eat veggies now, I'm a vegetarian so can't exactly escape it lol but there are still some I shy away from like onions, tomato, etc. However, I will say growing up Mexican American, not many of our dishes involved vegetables in their most basic form. Aside from caldo, most kind of become blended into what you're eating. Like I was used to enchiladas with beans on the side, and some Spanish rice. And if it was menudo it's bread as a side. I suppose you could argue Chile rellenos but that would be a stretch. Veggies weren't a huge side for my normal childhood meals. So I'm sure it didn't help me get over my aversion to them.",

Here in the USA I gotta stick my nose just to get a hint of smell. \n\nSteaming them or cooking them in a way gives you extra flavor.

I was so poor and starving at one point that I started going to the soup kitchen and they had these home cooked meals to feed everyone with and it was like \"omg this is so delicious\" even though they were super simple, they were so filling and it was so amazing to go and get free food, I was shocked.

I just don't know what's out there. So I eat like, literally nothing. I eat one meal a day and I'm so hungry but I don't know what to eat \ud83d\ude2d\n\nSo: why do western shows show kids hating vegetables?

I know as a toddler when my mom would leave town for work, my dad wouldn't feed us and would just give us cereal maybe? When I think of \"food\" my first thought is \"hungry\" and not \"yummy\" or \"satisfying\" or anything, LOL\n\nSo I wish I liked vegetables (and I actually DO like vegetables) but when I think of food I just get stressed.

I would think about what infinite feels like. I would think about where I stood in the world in relation to all of the people I saw that day. The good and the bad in everyone. The nothingness of space. The thought that when I die, there is nothing. What does nothing feel like? Then I would feel like I was sinking into my bed, and peacefully fall asleep.",

            "Yes, sonder.  It\u2019s a good word and there isn\u2019t enough if it in the world.  Your feeling can also be seen as a form of empathy for - and awareness of - others...looking outside of yourself.\n\nIt sounds so trite, but today, smart phones are the antithesis of sonder.  Selfies and the constant habit to be posting about oneself.  Perhaps it\u2019s because we are needy...needing others to be more aware of us as humans.\n\nIn the late 1950\u2019s, air conditioning in cars allowed for windows to be closed, creating a barrier between people, such as at a stop sign.  Tinted glass does the same thing.  Reduced communication...reduced sonder.\n\nI like that you experience sonder.",

How those are cars driven by people with destinations, with families and homes and lives they're just living. And homes. Homes where people are just living their lives. Are they making dinner? Reading to their kids? What are they thinking? What's their life like? I feel this a lot. Didn't know there was a word for it. Lol.",

Life is very sad for me (it\u2019s actually my birthday today, the first one since my mom died 3 months ago) and I awoke to texts from friends and what not. I live next to a highway. When I go out and have my morning coffee I see thousands upon thousands of cars going towards their destinations. Each vehicle is a person, and that person knows and has an impact on at least 20 other peoples lives, and so on and so forth.

            "I have a similar feeling, but mostly when driving through villages and citys that I don\u2019t know. Or from tower blocks and high rise buildings. I think about all those people and what they might be doing. Like eating, watching TV, fucking, beating up one another, singing a song, reading their child a book, doing coke and so on. All simultaneously, in the same high rise building. Right now numerous people are born and numerous people die. It is mind blowing, so I don\u2019t try to think about it too much.\n\nAlso I can\u2019t connect to all those people. I just drive by them in my car. Gives a feeling of intense loneliness and isolation in that moment.",
            "Honestly most of the time I don't think about the fact that theres people in the cars driving by. Even at crosswalks I might look at the person inside to get a clue if its safe to cross but dont even really look at their face or remember anything distinctive. Kinda disconnected.",

            "I think it\u2019s an incredibly important facet of building empathy for others. When someone dashes in front of me when they\u2019re rushing onto the train, when I see people talking about their stresses about stay at home orders, when I\u2019ve waited hours or days or weeks for a reply from a friend I texted, I try to think about this. It helps us realise the world is a big place, and we\u2019re just a small part of it. No need to get worked up over the little things, appreciate what others are going through and realise the world isn\u2019t just about yourself.",

            "I do get that feeling. I also do when I watch videos of people, especially inside a home. Like, these people are in their own house, somewhere else in the world, living their life. They moved into that house at some point, they sleep and eat there, they have fun, (shoot videos), have family get togethers, etc. It blows my mind sometimes.",

            "I have this and similar mind blowing experiences over what read as simple/obvious occurrences. \n\nAnother popular one to me is focusing on how my brain moves my body parts.

It is not like the fascists among us wear uniforms with badges on. There is no one single \"antifa\" movement which complicates things, as does some people labeling everyone *they* disagree with as antifa as a reason to dismiss their views or suggest they are automatically violent. What a mess.",
            "I am also anti-fascist. Most people are anti-fascist. Being anti-fascist is a good thing. \n\nHowever, there is a group of people who call themselves \"antifa.\"\n\nAntifa is literally just short for anti-fascist, and there is no formal organization. It's again just people who identify as anti-fascist.  A few somewhat formalized antifa groups have cropped up on college campuses or in cities, but because there is no formal organization, each group can be very different from the next in their actions and their rhetoric. Most of them are just peaceful interest groups who want to advocate against fascism etc, but some of them have done some pretty shady shit like arming themselves with improvised weapons and deliberately trying to incite violence at otherwise peaceful gatherings. \n\nAnd because a lot of media outlets and those who consume them are unable to see nuance, the word \"antifa\" has been widely misinterpreted as some huge formalized organization whose goal is to incite violence against conservatives.",
            "First off to clear somethings up to make it easier: Antifa (the anti fascist movement) is not even a group. You can\u2019t sign up for it, you can\u2019t really go the meetings, you just say it (authentically ofc) and it is. Now every so called attack from antifa, is not ordered to people, but done on their own free will. But a lot of conservative leaders usually label them as domestic terrorists, simply because most  right wing authoritarians are literally fascists. (Especially when you consider people want to label them domestic terrorists and not the Proud Boys or the KKK). \n\nBut there\u2019s a method to their madness, if they\u2019re labeled domestic terrorists, almost all of their peaceful demonstrations will be outlawed (you have to get permits for protests). But because antifa isn\u2019t a group. Basically anyone can be labeled a terrorist. That will literally end your career right there, because you wanted to protest fascism.

            "\"Anti-fascism\" is capitalism's way of \"othering\" its own horrors. Of attributing them to something external to capitalism. By labeling horrors like the holocaust as fascist horrors, it gets the working classes to ignore the fact that fascist governments are simply another form that the dictatorship of capital takes take under selective pressures, no different than liberal democracy in that regard. Specifically, fascism arises when the working class becomes a positive threat to capital's existence and the ruling class drops the facade of democracy and takes an authoritarian form, to  crush working class resistance for the good of capitalism as a whole.\n\nThus, anti-fascism becomes nothing more than a way to prop up capitalism and its ruling class. By contrasting evil, fascist governments with idealized bourgeois democracies, you ignore that they are just two sides of the same coin. By glorifying the WWII \"anti-fascist\" struggle, you justify the slaughter of millions of workers at the altar of capitalism, sacrifices to ensure the most advanced capitalist nations' continued and expanded control over colonies and resources, rather than some sort of moral battle between good and evil as the bourgeois narrative would have you believe.",

I agree with the general idea, but I distrust the many branches to be reasonable and good for its own causes. Many people rightfully are protesting, but many are indoctrinated and poorly informed. Take US protests for example, I fully support protestors who protest, and I even support some retaliation to unjust violence, yet there are looters which brand themselves as antifa, which in effect are acting either selfish or stupid, which I believe should be viewed by the movement as their enemies.      \n\nIn general those who are pro protests see the antifa as a movement that is rightfully displeased and fighting against corroding democracy. \n\nThose who are against protests are those who generally think that its a movement of either angsty crowd that doesn't have concrete demands, or sees the movement as bunch of looters, fucking up businesses and infrastructure. \n\nBoth of these views are right, because the whole movement is a large group of people doing different things. It takes just few looters for some news to make impression that the movement are just looters for its audience, and vice versa. \n\nEverything essentially is an echo chamber, in some circles something gets cherrypicked and demonized, in others idealized and criticisms ignored. I agree more with Antifa more than not, police reform is needed in US, but as someone in education in business, I also constantly see objectively bullshit claims made by Antifa \"representatives\" about economy-related things that remind me that most of the ideas are a problem if polarisation and self censorship is present. There never is \"one true ideology\" with every issue answers differ. But anyways thats human nature, we see one thing we fixate on it, and we lack self critisism. When you frame yourself as anti fascist, and something doesn't appear to fit your narrative, its easier to be defensive rather than self critical, as the source of critisism often is seen as likely anti anti fascist, just like for a religious fundementalist hearing that they are on the noblest cause possible its inconceivable that their belief might be detrimental in some aspects.",

            "I think right now people may be more aware of racism against black people because of Black Lives Matter, which may explain an increase in white people scolding racism against specifically black people. Maybe because they were more educated about racism against black people because of the recent movement, that could explain the specificity in race. I for one know a lot of people were oblivious before BLM rose.\n\nThat of course doesn\u2019t excuse it. Racism against Asians is still extremely prominent, especially against East-Asians during COVID-19 (from the virus originating from Wuhan - definitely doesn\u2019t justify it one bit but explains the rise).\n\nThe simple answer? We don\u2019t know. It\u2019s extremely hypocritical to denounce racism against one oppressed group of people but turn around and contribute to oppression regarding another. Something you can do to prevent this is call them out on their behaviour. It isn\u2019t your obligation but it always helps to call out racism when you see it.",

            "First comment on Reddit so please be kind :)\n\nI am an Desi guy (Indian heritage but my family line has not lived in India for over 140 years) from South Africa and now living in Europe. Racism exists against us as well, its just a lot more subtle than with blacks.\n\nIn the South African context, blacks have had it much worse than Indians during Apartheid, and in their own land too. From my understanding, it is very similar to the segregation laws in the USA. This racism still continues to this day and although not codified in law, it is still a huge obstacle for them to overcome. I see movements like BLM as important to give them some dignity and spread awareness of the blatent discrimination that they face.\n\nI've mainly created this account to also share that Indians were the next group of 'slaves' once the Atlantic Slave Trade was abolished. We were called 'Indentured Labourers' and were taken from India to countries like South Africa, Suriname, Fiji and Mauritius (to name a few) to work the plantations. These Indians were taken on fixed term contracts with pay and the opportunity to return to India after. However, a tax was levied on those wages, often up to 100% of the wages, and many Indians were not given an opportunity to return to India. This system was devised as a more humane system to chattel slavery, but the outcome was the same, extremely cheap or free labour for the British.\n\nIndians were seen as second class to whites in Apartheid South Africa, and consequently given more opportunities than blacks. This has helped us in becoming an extremely successful demographic. A lot of this is down to us keeping our culture and traditions relatively intact, and the high focus on education and entrepreneurship. We know that our only real asset is our minds, and we do extremely well to make that work for us. \n\nThe racism we face us a lot for subtle in that we have to be really good at the things we do to get the same reward as a white person. In my personal experience, I can do the same job to the same degree/quality as a white person, yet I will be paid less and have my work picked apart a lot more than a white person does. In South Africa, there is a joke that if you want something cheap but good quality, go to an Indian.\n\nTogether with our stoic culture, we do not fight as hard as blacks do for recognition. We are generally a successful group of people, but this is despite the subtle racism we face. As some other comments have mentioned, the stereotypes about call centers, rape, etc exist even for those of us who have no modern day connection to India. I think we are just seen as easy targets who won't fight back.",

            "Former white kid from America here, still white, no longer kid. I'd say it's just more socially unacceptable to say racist things about black people for some reason. Probably partially because of america's history with racism geared specifically toward black people and also because black people are the 2nd most populous minority in the us, behind only hispanic/latinos. Ovbiously this depends on where you live  but I'll say personally my high school in nw Indiana (1 hr from Chicago) was mostly black kids and white kids. There were a few other ethnicities but they were far outweighed. \n\nAlso, media coverage of blm recently and historically. Possible that some white people don't know racial slurs which are hurtful towards other ethnicities just due to lack of education of them/exposure to them so while they may not say those things themselves they also don't recognize them as bad, although with context and tone it is usually apparent they are some kind of insult at the very least. Just spitballing here.\n\nOverall better awareness of this problem should be spread because while I am white and I could never understand what real racial discrimination is like, racist people are not cool, and the more people truly fighting against them (and not just for some stupid internet hearts or updoots), the better.",

            "[Gonna assume OP is in America. CMIW.]\n\nI think a lot of it has to do with\u2013specific to East and South Asians\u2013the model minority stereotype. Americans (White people especially) generally think of Asians as A) a group that doesn't experience \"real\" racism and thus don't need/deserve defense, or B) don't think about them at all, so they don't think about what happens to them. The group subjected to the stereotype will sometimes try to adhere to the stereotype, unfortunately, as a coping mechanism. Laughing at the racist jokes at their own expense, ignoring (and sometimes participating in) racist acts against others, and all together minimizing their \"other\"-ness in the presence of white people\u2013which ultimately reinforces the model minority stereotype on the back end. African-Americans have never had that stereotype and have a much longer relationship to American racism and interact with it much differently. We don't really have many *positive* stereotypes about us and don't commonly have the option of coping with racism by reinforcing stereotypes. Reinforcing stereotypes can get you killed. However, for a lot of non-white communities (especially those with large immigrant populations), enduring some racism is acceptable because if it's the cost of a good American life, then so be it, and so they don't speak out against it. While this happens in the Black community, it's a less common attitude because throughout the Diaspora, we have very similar experiences with racism/oppression.\n\nTL/DR: East/South Asians for reasons are not as vocal about the racism they experience, and white people are not as aware of/sensitive to it. However, Black people are and white people act accordingly.",

There is *still continuing* abuse and genocide through medical malpractice.

            "Kind of a long story, but it has a point.\n\nI am white girl living in the US. Growing up, I learned about the enslavement of blacks (I'm an early 2000s kid, so maybe I learned more about it than some born earlier might've growing up). I remember watching an animated movie about Harriet Tubman, or another (a folk tale, I think) about a black man who raced and out-sped a tunnel-mining train, working so hard that he died at the end. He did it just to show the white men who brought the technology what he could do.\n\nI also remember going to Chick-fil-A, and getting books in my kids meal about different historical figures. One time, I got one about Lewis Pasteur, but another time, I got one about Harriet Tubman.\n\nI only once ever experienced racism growing up (other than the ridiculous stuff people on Twitter say about white people). When I was eight years old or so, I was following my mom around the library, reading to my baby brother in the stroller. I was reading to him about a black woman who had ran in the Olympics. Of course, the black woman who said she couldn't trust my mother \"because you're white\" wasn't paying attention to that. To this day, people assume my mother must've done something racist, but that wasn't the case. Some people are just jerks, and that lady was one of those people.\n\nThat interaction really stressed me out. Before then, I had never truly *comprehended* racism. But now I was asking questions, like *Why would anyone do that? Why would anyone treat someone differently based on race?*\n\nI didn't really know any black people at the time. I was home schooled. The kids at co-op were white, and the kids in my neighborhood and around town were Hispanic. That interaction shaped my young mind's opinion of black people in a negative way.\n\nWhen my mom accidentally scratched a car while parking, and the lady who came out of it was black, I was afraid she'd be angry at my white mother, because she was white, and in my young mind, when a white person did something a black person didn't like, it would make them mad.\n\n(The first thing the woman said was, \"It's okay baby! It's okay!\" before she had even made it all the way over to my mother. She hugged my mother, and continued to tell her it was okay.)\n\nI understood better after that, and looking back now, I too had been making generalizations after my one bad experience that were rather racist, even if I was a young and impressionable child. Yes, white people had done some bad things to blacks in the past. But that didn't mean that all black people hated white people, or that I needed to always be on eggshells around them. I was making an unfair judgement.\n\nNow, I understood what they'd suffered. Just that one experience felt so awful to me--and how bad must it be for people who dealt with it so much more often?\n\n**I never really had that kind of experience with other races, and I wasn't taught about it as extensively in school, either.** Obviously, I've learned about other race issues in high school, but I was home schooled up until high school, and my mother taught me the history most relevant to us--as people of Jewish descent, the Holocaust was what we focused on for WWII, not the Japanese internment camps. And, like any school, we focused on the enslavement of blacks much more than the subjugation of the native Americans.\n\nThe enslavement of black people is like a **big, black mark** upon the US's history that we can't ignore when the population of black people in our country is so large. Maybe we can get away with it for the native Americans, since there are no where near as many of them left, but not the blacks. And I think most white people never learned that a \"you'd better never do anything that might offend a black person, *or else*,\" isn't a good mentality to have. But our brains are smart enough not to instill that mentality about other races on a whim, when we weren't taught to act like that. **But that also means that some people revert to their true, jerk selves around other races.**\n\nAnyway, that's my long-winded story. I'm not exactly sure how to conclude it, so, the end, I guess? Thanks for reading.",

            "I believe it\u2019s because the American education system kind of subtly taught children to look at people by the category.

Maybe they pay the teachers more in other countries or theres a lower student to teacher ratio per class. In college you're literally paying a stupid amount for it and you have a vast amount of resources like tutors, office hours, study groups, the library, TAs, etc. That helps negate the often 300+ student to 1 teacher ratios they have in college.

            "I haven't read all of the comments here but I think some people are missing the point. The top American universities, by and large, are considered the gold standard, not so much for education necessarily, but for research and academic production. A place that is ranked 15th in America, like a Berkely or a Hopkins produces a shit load more important research in the physical and social sciences as well as the humanities than the best research institutions in other countries. That's just a fact and rankings of universities\u2014including those not produced by English-speaking institutions\u2014prove this over and over. The issue is that many people can either not afford or are not smart enough to attend those schools, and the education one receives there will not necessarily correlate with the prestige of production from the university's professors. The reason that the top 50 or so American universities are so good is due to a number of factors, the largest of which is $$$. Money pours into the schools in the form of research funds and professor salaries. A professorship at Harvard pays more than one at the Sorbonne, Oxford, etc., so it's more attractive. All things considered, an expert in a field would probably rather teach (or, rather, be a faculty member) at an American institution than a foreign one. Academic brain drain is very much a thing. \n\nNow, why is secondary education so poor? Same reason. Lack of money. A ton of school districts in America do not fund education the way they should, leading to too large classrooms, understaffing, shitty resources, underpaid teachers (leaving the job as one accepted by people who aren't smart enough to do something that would make them more money), etc. Again, speaking by and large, the feeder schools into places like Harvard, Yale, Princeton, etc. have kids who are just as smart and learning just as much as those in other countries. It's the mass of underfunded shitty schools and school districts that give American education a bad name, though there are structural problems to this and I'm not blaming the schools or the teachers so much as shitty politicians who talk about how important it is to teach children but repeatedly deny them funds or funnel money into already well funded districts through property taxes, etc.",

I discovered that there were as many immigrants in tech as there were Americans, sometimes more immigrants than Americans. What I found is that tech jobs generally required you to have a science/engineering background, which unlike Asian countries, was not as common at secondary school level because science-y kids are viewed as nerds and not a lot of them wanted to be nerds. However, at college level, only the most motivated of the kids from secondary school went to college and the rest were able to go out and do other jobs and still make a decent living\n\nAmerica being as prosperous as it is, was able to pour a lot of money and resources into science and research at a very high level. The combination of the smartest kids and a lot of money made higher education reach the high levels that it has today",
            "It\u2019s because you\u2019re looking at a public vs private educational system. \n\nThe majority of American secondary schools are public: state run and funded by taxes. Much of a school\u2019s funding is based on property taxes, so schools in rich suburbs get more funding than schools in poor/low income areas. Because of this system your educational experience is VASTLY different based on location, varying from state to state and city to city. Because there\u2019s no country wide standard for education, many high schools in poorer regions are left with worse teachers, wore buildings and an insufficient secondary education. \n\nAmerican universities on the other hand, at least the Ivy League \u201cGold Standard\u201d schools, are privately run. Most developed nations including the US offer public universities that are subsidized by state government, but private universities like Harvard or MIT are completely separate entities. They\u2019re self sufficient and don\u2019t rely on tax payer money. Because of this, tuition is WAY more expensive ($100,000+/year) and they\u2019re able to be much more selective about who they let in. American higher education is seen as the gold standard because these schools are rich. Full stop. These schools have renowned scholars teach classes, they own the best equipment/libraries/facilities, and have top researchers fighting over the chance to work at the university, all because they have hundreds of millions of dollars to spend on these things. As good as many public universities are around the world, it\u2019s extremely hard to compete when you don\u2019t have as much money.",
            "I find the amount of intellectual dishonesty in this thread amusing considering the subject",
            "My guess . . . competition. Say what you want about markets, but competition usually makes for a better product. There's no competition in secondary education, you go where your district lines tell you to go. You may move to a private school, or even move school districts, but there's no incentive for a school to try to be better than another school except maybe funding. Colleges, on the other hand, are very obviously competing for the \"best\" in many different arenas -- best scientists, best writers, best athletes, richest alumni, etc. They have all kinds of incentive to keep their standards high. There are plenty of colleges that are not impressive, and plenty of programs within otherwise impressive colleges that aren't very impressive. American universities have a great reputation (as does America) so we're literally competing with colleges in the US and around the globe for the best and brightest. You can't say that about the average American public high school, which takes what it gets.",
            "The simplest answer is money.",
            "The big problem with American secondary education is private American secondary education. You don't need a credential to teach in private schools in most places in the US. You don't even need a credential to start a private school, or a charter school (thanks, Calvinists). As a result, many kids get left behind and only tests, like AP, SAT and ACT, give any weight to the value of the quality of the education provided. I grew up in Berkeley, California, and although it is a place that attracts and retains some of the smartest people in the world, it is filled to the brim with independent schools that continuously and regularly fail children and young people. At my own high school, they had a policy that any graduate could come back and try teaching. \n\nFor example, I took French, and when I went to Europe, I was speaking French to a woman in England and she said, \"I have never met an American who speaks French with a German accent\". She was from Latvia! Seriously, a French teacher with 30 years of experience never found out her own speaking abilities weren't up to the standard of the language she was teaching? Breathtaking.",
            "American high schools attempt to educate all of its citizens til the age of 18 and attempt to teach them all the same things. It just doesn\u2019t work out well that way. In many countries, high school is only three years long and only a total of 9 years of education is required instead of 12. Only students that want to spend extra years learning do so. American high schools are filled with people that don\u2019t want to be there learning how to find the roots of a 5th degree polynomial when they just want to be a hair dresser or something equally not related. And then their test scores are compared with students from other countries that actually tried hard to learn that stuff,",
            "I realize that me being a top student in my highschool I\u2019d probably rank average in other countries.",
            "Cuz one of them is free and the other has a very large, insurmountable paywall.",
            "Elite American Universities attract people from all around the globe and lead the world in many research areas. They largely account for the reputation you describe.\n\nSecondary schools in America don't have a global reach, even the elite ones. Mostly because students don't want to move and they don't conduct research.",
            "I have honestly never heard American education referred to as the gold standard.",
            "By and large secondary education is free while higher ed is not. Theres also a lot more high schools. More schools + less budget = poorer quality of teacher since you usually need a master's to teach high school and if you're smart enough to get the masters, you can find more money in private sector or go for the phd.\n\nThe fact that paying for higher ed is mostly the responsibility of the student in the US means that there isnt as much competition for entering university. In other countries where it might be paid for, you will have needed to really excel in high school in order to get into university.",
            "Private vs public.",
            "American secondary education is one of the few systems in the world that believes in educating all students, regardless of ability, in the same content. \n\nFor example, many secondary institutions around the world do not provide education to individuals with developmental disabilities. In comparison, United States\u2019 education systems believe in mainstreaming developmentally delayed students to provide opportunities to learn how to socialize, work with others, etc. these students, when mainstreamed, are also part of the classroom environment which means that teachers are now teaching to an even broader range of students. \n\nIt\u2019s also notable that many of the world\u2019s better viewed secondary education systems are big on CTE programs where students who are not viewed as academically top-tier are placed into schools to learn trades instead of pursuing the path toward university/college. \n\nAlso,  I personally think of Oxford and Cambridge as the gold standard of education, but recognize that the Ivy Leagues of the US are probably close to the top in the world as well.",
            "I would say that the difference is in priorities. American public schools are an obedience model of education. It's set up more to model a job or corporate office and prepares you to be locked in a box for 40hrs/week and do what your told. Where as college campuses were remodeled in the 1960s to be places of free thinking and expression where creativity is prioritized. I would say that's definitely changing but American colleges still have that reputation.",
            "A lot of coutries separate schools by intelligence. For example: Germany. For their average students who will go into trades or low-paying jobs and aren't as smart, they have the Realschule. For their top 25% who will go into college and become a doctor or scientist or something like that, they have the Gymnasium. This top 25% is what is considered for their national average. \n\nIn America, everyone goes to the same High School. This is our national average.\n\nAmerica is one of the top for schooling early on because most people have the capacity to pass K-6 and usually even 7th and 8th grade with all A's and B's (and maybe only one or two C's). Once you hit High School, that average drops because some people don't have the capacity, but they're still considered in the national average.",
            "American universities cost tens of thousands of dollars per year to attend. Public secondary education is paid for via tax money, and barely any at that. Professors at universities have Ph.D.'s and their main job is to do research and they get paid a good salary. Public high school teachers get paid very little, so good ones are few and far between.",
            "Also, at least historically, immigrants contribute a great deal to higher education. The best and the brightest from all over the world come here to join the university systems. They stay, become professors, and the cycle continues. We owe a LOT to our immigrant educators.",
            "I genuinely think only the US has this opinion that US education is \"gold standard\". I don't think the rest of the world sees it that way. It's just propaganda telling it's own people that their country's education is \"the best\".",
            "I live in middle USA, in know way do I believe that the United States, gold standard, and education belong in the same sentence.",
            "I think it's because they are the loudest and most arrogant about it..",
            "Where exactly is American Higher education seen as the gold standard?\n\nI'm from the UK and none of us would have chosen an American University over a British one. Australian would probably have been a more popular choice.",
            "In all honesty, international students, from Asia at least, are now scared to come to the US because of the recent developments in politics, mass shootings and the like. Most of my classmates (and me) changed our universities of choice to those in Europe immediately after 2015.",
