            "I remember the 1st boob I saw from far post-puberty, it was like being born again, and a mind-fuck of epic proportions.\n\nThen, I remember the 1st time I saw boobs out in the context of being intimate with someone. 1st instinct was to grab and the 2nd simultaneous one was to go to suck the nipple. IT was like figuring out all secrets of life that day.",
            "Some love them, some dont care. If you don't thats ok. Everyone is different.",
            "I have gay friends that still love boobs.  I know straight women that love boobs.\n\nPretty sure there's a heavy evolutionary psychology mechanism that makes one and all love boob.\n\nBoob.",

            "Let me put it this way.\n\nI'm an asexual dude. I think sex is gross, have no desire to get into a relationship, I don't like physical touch, and yet...\n\nI think boobs are awesome. Can't explain it. They're the only thing that turn me on in the slightest.",
            "Completely cis, het male here, in my 50s.\n\nUntil I started playing with them, I completely agree with you. As a teen, I was way more into what women had in their shorts and just not into boobs at all. But once I started actually having sex, the boobs became part of the fun. This was for two reasons. First, they really are soft and fun to touch. Seeing them and touching them are just fundamentally different. Second, a lot of women like having their boobs played with. And their response to this play is a big turn on. Some women can orgasm just from boob play. A lot of men are turned on by the obvious pleasure of their partner. So, this ends up being a big turn on for me when she acts like she enjoys it.",
            "Personally yeah I think they're hot, but as a woman myself with literal DD cups, I envy those with smaller boobs. When I see large boobs I can't help but think \"damn that must hurt\" because mine are painful and uncomfortable. So I'm sure they feel the same way too. It's fine if you don't like boobs, everyone has their preferences, and it doesn't make you gay if you don't find them hot. If boobs aren't for you they aren't for you and that's okay! I hope you find what you like! <3",
            "My rule of thumb for sexuality is \u201cif you don\u2019t want to put your mouth on it, you probably aren\u2019t into it\u201d.\n\nEdit: To clarify\u2026 for me\u2026 satisfaction in the bedroom is about engaging five senses. True chemistry with other people exists. I couldn\u2019t be satisfied if I didn\u2019t want to fully engage with my partner\u2026 enthusiastically.",
            "I like hugging my wife and feeling them against me.  \n\nI wonder if that\u2019s why guys don\u2019t hug as much.  Hug a woman and you feel their boobs.  Hug a guy . . . Eh, nothing.",
            "Boobs are great, and like someone else commented, many women enjoy having them played with so there's the added bonus of pleasing your partner.\n\nI will say personally I never found giant boobs to be all that special until I was messing around with a woman with ENORMOUS natural breasts, who loved to give head. Well, her tits were so big, when she was going down on me they would rub on my thighs and it felt amazing. \n\nStill love small tits too, but that was a unique experience.",
            "Some days they do more for me than others. Maybe you prefer butts, or penis, or forearms or maybe you don't find physical attraction to anyone at all and prefer emotional attractions. Maybe the physical comes after that. Maybe you're asexual and don't feel any of it.\n\nThe important thing is it is all valid and you are allowed to feel however you want about what you are or aren't attracted to in people. Don't stress about it and just feel things out as you go. For me I have a hard time being into someone until I get to know them and really like who they are. You could be a perfect 10 but if I strongly dislike your personality your boobs are powerless.",
            "I've been married 24 years and I still want to see and touch my wife's boobs, like all the time. It's definitely a big thing for some people.",
            "They vary in attractiveness. Some are stunning, breathtaking: lovely to see, inviting snuggling, kissing, fondling, sniffing, tasting, sucking -- and are memorable, even unforgettable.\n\nThe key to understanding is we are mammals, a class named in honor of tits. At birth, tits are life. Although we are all born nearsighted, we can see tits and nipples, hungering for the scent, taste, and warmth of tits. Sucking the nipples keeps us fed and hydrated, being critical to our very survival.\n\nFor the great bulk of us as we grow up, both males and females never lose our attraction to tits.",

            "I find the physics of them appealing, and I am excited by their movement and shape as they interact with other objects. I am artistically and sensually attracted by how they modify a woman's outline in different poses. I am sure a portion of it is that boobs are relatively hidden, so there is a certain appeal to seeing them, like it's a \"secret\" being shared, with my finding it erotic for breasts to be partially-exposed, which makes me curious about the rest, and the curiosity causes arousal to think about.\n\nEdit: Not necessarily just large breasts, if I came off as implying that. I also include medium, small, and flat in this, though the physics comment applies to differing degrees, \"medium\" being the sweet-spot for my physics comment.",

I like this part of you (chest hair, hands, lips etc) outside of sex, they bring me some form of feel-goodness.

So I don't think whether you like boobs or not is necessarily an indicator of sexuality... having said that I don't find them offputting either. I'm just an ass girl whatever the gender!",

            "Both fun and sexual.\n\nBoobs feel fantastic, and are just fun.  But also, if a girl is really into nipple play, then it's a really easy way to get her to make the good noises.  Sucking on nipples and feeling her squirm and moan and breathing heavy is a super big turn-on.",

            "People have different interests.\n\nSome people might die for thick thighs, while others find them repulsive.\n\nSame for big boobs, small boobs, big ass, small ass, hair color, etc. Its important, when you are figuring yourself out, to look at the whole picture.. Not liking/seeing the like for one aspect, doesnt mean the rest of the package is undesirable. \n\nThat being said, personally, I love boobs. I wanna hold them, bury my face in them, play with them, look at them, and other more.. uh..intimate things. Theres just something pleasant and comforting about them, for me. \n\nWhatever they, or anything else, end up being for you.. I hope you figure things out for yourself and find your happiness.",
            "Bi woman here and I fucking love boobs, including my own. I unconsciously grab my boobs a lot, or lay on them (I got F cups), squeeze them because it feels good, or a number of other things. And I wanna do the same to other boobs. I am a boob aficionado",
            "I know at least one gay man who enjoys boobs. As a hetero man, I enjoy boobs as well. There's no clear-cut answer on what liking them or not means, and life can be complicated.\n\nThe better question to ask yourself is *who* do you find attractive? Ultimately the human various bits are attached to is going to be more important than the bits.",
            "I like the way playing with them makes the person who has them feel.",
            "My man, boobs are nice but coming to this sub with a question about your sexuality and thinking it's tied to your perception of boobs is wildly silly to put it mildly. \n\nLook, sexuality is a very strange spectrum which you will figure out what you prefer as time goes on. Some people are straight but think boobs are \"meh.\" While others may think boobs are hot when they are not straight. And the most important part of that is that, all of that is OK.\n\nMy point is that at the end of the day, if you can accept who you are and what you prefer then it doesn't matter what other people think is attractive as long as you understand yourself and your body. The whole idea of \"I don't like boobies, therefore I must be gay\" is pretty immature logic because maybe you haven't seen boobs that you like, maybe you will find them attractive if they are on someone you like/love, or maybe you are more of an ass man. At the end of the day it doesn't matter. What matters is that you are comfortable with how YOU feel, not \"do these bags of chest fat make me horny\" or how other people, especially strangers on the internet, feel about boobs.",
            "I'm a heterosexual man and if i had tits i would never leave the house.\n\nTits are fantastic.",

            "Yes.  They are nearly mesmerizing at times.  So many happy chemicals from seeing/feeling them.",
            "I don't think this is 100% connected to sexuality, if you haven't interacted with them and haven't accepted the social programming that they are inherently exciting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo you fantasize about other parts of women or vaguely about physical/sexual contact with women? Then general feelings are way more important than the specific body parts.",
            "I'm a straight woman and I find boobs really attractive.",
            "Depends.\n\nOn what, I'm not sure.\n\nBut it depends.",
            "Ive never really been into boobs for some reason. I don't dislike them, I just don't have a use for them. I've always been more into other parts of the female body. I will say, however, that I'm not a fan of insanely large boobs. That's the only time that boobs really come into play for me. I like women to have a certain athletic look and really big boobs kind of ruin that for me. Every guy is different. My best friend is obsessed with enormous boobs.",

            "My boy let me tell you the beauty of boobs: they\u2019re soft and squishy. They\u2019re meant to be a comfort as you lay your head on them. They\u2019re fun to bounce and touch, they\u2019re soft. But gods the best thing about boobs is the person who has them",
            "Yes. Boobs are soft. Boobs are supple. You know how when you grab a woman's breast, it feels like, a bag of sand. Yeaahhhh.. actually I have no idea. I'm a virgin. But they do look nice. I find them hot.",

            "To everyone their own tastes but yes, I enjoy seeing them, touching them, and also everything else.\n\nOn the other hand butts don't do anything for me, it's just personal preferences.\n\nDon't think too much of it, just enjoy what you enjoy. You may prefer thighs, butts, boobs, hands, feet, hair... honestly any part of someone's body and there is no problem at all with it.",
            "Definately not what everyone thinks. Not all people who are attracted to females are attracted because of the boobs. There are many different aspects that cause attraction. From foot fetishes to beautiful voices(yes there is a voice fetish), it's all up to you. Also nothing wrong with not being sexually active, just be yourself. If your really wanting to find out if something attracts you, fetish porn has alot more variety than the standard stuff",
            "The function of breasts is to nourish a baby. \n\nDepending on where you live, breasts have become sexual objects due to having to keep them covered at all times in public. Me? I\u2019m an ass man. But I do enjoy the way huge tits jiggle when a woman with an ill-fitting bra walks. It\u2019s sexually exciting to me. If it\u2019s not to you, no worries.

            "Nope. \n\nIt\u2019s not something I would really like or support someone doing. Since it\u2019s not my place to literally own another human being, the very easy solution is to just not get into intimate relationships with people who do sex work. Wouldn\u2019t really be fair to them or myself. \n\nAs an aside, I notice whenever this gets brought up, there\u2019s a contingent of people who make it a mission to somehow prove this opinion \u201cwrong\u201d. I guess I\u2019d like to say a few things to counter that notion. \n\nIt isn\u2019t any more wrong than any other dating or relationship preference. People aren\u2019t entitled to a relationship with everybody else on the planet. Refusing to date certain people for some particular reason also isn\u2019t some personal attack against them or indicative of a broader belief that invalidates them as human beings. Romantic rejection hurts but is a reality of human life, and those who reject our advances aren\u2019t monsters for it.\n\nI would personally never date a sex worker, but they are human beings deserving of respect and dignity. The right to respect and dignity isn\u2019t inclusive of the right to a relationship with everyone, though. There are people who would never date me for any number of reasons. Their reasoning is as valid as my reasoning. \n\nFurthermore, It\u2019s really not a big deal. There are plenty of people who would be okay with it. Does being a sex worker perhaps exclude a sizable portion of partners? Sure. So does being a single parent. So does having mental illness. So does having extreme financial problems. So does having specific political or religious views, or even living geographically remote areas. There are numerous circumstances or categories which can narrow the pool of your possible partners, and those fitting these categories are still able to find love and happiness, so this isn\u2019t a circumstance at all exclusive to sex work. \n\nNot everyone is equipped or wiling to handle those sorts of issues. It does mean finding a partner becomes a greater effort, but it\u2019s better than trying to \u201cmake it work\u201d And having a doomed-to-fail relationship because of a fundamental incompatibility. You\u2019re better off being upfront about it so that hopefully you can at least exclude those who aren\u2019t okay with it immediately.",

If it's something she wants to hide from a partner, it doesn't bode well for the relationship.",

The same things that would make dating a stripper are present, but the customers have the ability to contact her outside of work, and anyone can participate from anywhere, any time. \n\nBasically, it is attracting sexual attention from as many men as possible for money and adulation . The fact that money is earned from it is actually secondary to the validation and inflation of her ego so far as the effects of it on her life, unless she is particularly successful, but even then the fact that she is earning more than a standard living for her \u201cwork\u201d will likely be a source of validation increasing her perceived value and subverting the less profitable, less plentiful validation and attention her SO can give her, with less work and accountability. \n\nIf she is earning a lot of money from it, then she is incentivizing herself to rely on that skill set for her subsistence if not her financial advancement, which would be a threat to any relationship because not only is it relying on the attention of other men to build up and maintain her self worth, but her net worth as well. She is being incentivized to develop nothing else but her skill at turning on other men and to embrace narcissism as a lifestyle. \n\nIt is not ethically wrong and should not be stigmatized but alternatively it shouldn\u2019t be normalized either as it is incompatible with the types of relationships that would involve the nomenclature \u201cgirlfriend\u201d in  terms of heterosexual relationships. If it is agreeable to the boyfriend, then great have at it, but my standards of conduct in a relationship exclude having the narcissism, vanity, and sex-based valuation promoted by those slick digital pimps running that very vacuous website.",

Any politician who seeks to stop publically funded Catholic schooling gets ruined by the Catholic Church. \n\nSo why is it allowed? Because the Catholics say it's allowed.

I also heard ten times more bias political talk from teachers in the public schools than I did in the Catholic school. Did it teach about God? Sure, but public funds don't go to the school so it really doesn't matter. \n\nThe best part of catholic school was they were actually able to discipline us and the rules were much stricter. Plus smaller number of students per teacher made it much easier to learn. When I got to public school I was like two grades ahead of everyone else. Public school felt like a free for all. The teachers would spew their personal bias all the time and the kids could do so much stuff and not get in trouble because the teachers had way less power. I also kind of liked having a uniform requirement at catholic school. It prepared me for work life and honestly I didn't have to worry about what to wear every day or what other kids would think. \n\nOf course I'm comparing one Catholic school to one public school.

There are also reports of teachers who publicly encouraged violence against those who support the right. There have also been numerous other issues as well. \n\nI don't have an issue with teaching politics, but it needs to be impartial. Kids should be taught how to make decisions based on the issues at hand and become educated voters. A teacher preaching one political party over the other and ridiculing / bullying those that don't agree, is indoctrination period. The whole issue with things like Critical Race Theory and the anti- Trump BS just shows the true intent of schools to push kids down one path. \n\nThe fact that kids today think that socialism and communism is good and capitalism is bad and they say the Constitution is bad and needs to go away is alarming.

Now I know Canada is a bit different fron the US in that we have 0 religious subject matter at all in schools unless you go to a Catholic School or take a religion course (rarely offered) in High School. Therefore, a teacher sharing their opinions on either religion or politics is not allowed here.\n\nThat being said there is a vast difference between opinion and education, and while that line blurs a bit more for religion, it still exists.

            "OK so this is actually due to better and better audio equipment being out there, the way the audio engineer mixes the sound and the type of speakers and DAC you have.\n\nOn the first point, this is actually noticeable over the last one or two decades in film. Before, audio equipment wasn't as precise, so actors really had to belt their lines and enunciate. As tech got better they didn't have to speak as clearly or loudly. Unfortunately, they seem to have overcorrected and most actors now tend to speak in a normal speaking voice, which isn't great.\n\nThe second point comes down to the loudness war and how audio engineers and produces throw a bunch of compression on the soundtrack to make it as loud as possible. Unfortunately that compression makes a lot of the dynamic aspect of sound go away, so everything is loud without any nuance. If you ever notice that speaking voice is at the same or close loudness level to the music or sound effects, this is why.\n\nFinally, each speaker sold by every company for the average consumer has some form of beautification on it. Bose is one of the most well known for this, which is why consumers put such a high value on Bose for sounding great, whereas most proffesionals wouldn't touch a Bose when producing because of all the effects it introduces. Sometimes this equalization or EQ setting can make the sounds be a bit wonky, especially if it isn't set to the thing it's reproducing. If you have an EQ setting which boosts bass and reduces mids and trebles, it can be hard to hear voices over everything else.\n\nSo yes, it is normal and no, you don't need to see a doctor (unless you have this issue with ALL voices).",

This is where you don\u2019t have hearing LOSS, the way d/Deaf and hard of hearing people do, but your brain doesn\u2019t interpret the signals from your ears well. A common manifestation of this disorder is to have trouble understanding speech when there\u2019s background noise.\n\nDo you feel like you have an unusually hard time understanding people at parties, food courts, or other crowded areas?

            "you may have bad (or at least, bad for you) speakers/headphones. I had this problem until I started using in-ear headphones, the kind that plug right snug into your ear canal. I also find that sound is balanced differently in the past 5-10 years than it used to be, based on changes in general speaker production, so if you have speakers older than that they may be outputting sound a little bit differently from the types of speakers which are most commonly produced/sold today. Newer speakers tend to be very weirdly lacking in the mid-levels, like it's almost nonexistant, and that's where most human speech sound lays, in the mid-level range more than bass or high-level. \n\nSo if you have newer speakers, mess with your sound balance on your speakers if you can, turn the mid-levels way up, and the bass/high levels down low, and then turn the master volume up slightly. \n\nalso try in-ear 'plug' style headphones",

I have always wondered if other people do this.  \n\nIt started because I live in a Spanish speaking country and would always try and convince my friends to watch films with the original English voices with Spanish subtitles (dubbed voices are so bad). I started to enjoy seeing it translated into Spanish on screen as I was watching - mostly because translations are usually shit and I like thinking how I would have translated.  \n\nAfter a while I started to watch English with English subtitles and I now automatically watch everything with subtitles. It helps me to follow and it's also really useful for my SO as, although he is fluent, his first language isn't English.",

            "This is an extremely common problem with modern TVs. Manufacturers have been trying to make tvs thinner and thinner with almost no bezels. Which means there is no room for good forward firing speakers. Most thin style tvs have incredibley poor speakers that fire down or even backwards at the wall so all you get are reflected loud parts and the dialogue is mushy. If you dont want to get a fancy surround sound system at least get a sound bar. Just having speakers that face you instead of the ground will go a looooong way."

I worked near an abandoned car wash. One day, I saw a man behind the place with a prayer rug saying noon prayers. I waited until he finished and then went to talk to him. He was a homeless vet, probably some mental issues. He told me that when he got pennies in the money he panhandled, he would leave them heads up around the city because a lot of people believed finding a penny heads up was good luck. If a homeless person can take the time and be thoughtful enough to try to make the world just a little brighter, shouldn't we all find a way to do the same?",

Turns out a teacher had been collecting my cranes all over the school and putting them in his classroom and students had been enjoying them all this time. I didn't take geography anymore and never saw it but still\nThe same year the school had an anniversary and did a contest in which you got bonus points for every crane turned in.

We were sitting in a booth with two little old asian ladies, probably in their late 60s. They did not speak French, and we did not speak their language, but they were smiling and being friendly to a little girl. They pulled pretty paper squares out of their purses and started making origami. Boxes, frogs, cranes, birds... I just remember being fascinated. It was so impressive.  Small animals coming out of paper sheets. I spend hours watching them. \n\n35 years later, I still have some of those. I wonder if the ladies knew how happy they made little me. \n\nPlease keep leaving your origami for other people to find. We all can use a little bit of joy, and I know I would be absolutely ecstatic to find one.",
            "Far as I can tell it's pretty universal, littering is the act of placing rubbish in a location in which it does not belong (barbed wire in my local store parking lot). \n\nA piece of origami is not usually considered a waste material, first part is out. Something people want to pick up in a location for them to find is not in a location it does not belong. So, the second part is also not applicable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThus, I would say no it is not littering, keep on, keeping on."

My dad said he and his boss only overlapped in person every couple of days because they got so out of synch.\n\nThe dining hall up there served breakfast and lunch/dinner food every 6 hours around the clock.  So no matter what weird sleep schedule you were in you would be able to get breakfast during your \"morning\" even if that was at like 9pm.",
            "There was a pretty cool study published in the journal Science in 1999 about this topic. If you lock a person in a room with no windows or clocks they will naturally follow a daily rhythm thats about 25 hours long. \n\nThere have been other, more recent studies that argue against this and state that its closer to 24 hours, but the point stands that people are built differently and you can sleep and live how you like.",

Around 16-17 hours is when my body starts to get a second wind and get creative and mental energy, when most people would be winding down.

            "Everyone's body clock is different: usually around 24 hours, but it can vary by the individual. For most people that's fine -they get tired 15 minutes before bedtime, or they struggle a little to fall asleep because their body is expecting the day to be a little longer. But for some of us (and I'd count myself as one) the difference is more like an hour or so, and it causes problems\n\nSince I was 8 years old (possibly earlier, but that's the first I remember) my body has wanted to go to bed and get up about an hour and a half later than the day before. I've spent years trying to \"fix\" it, by having excellent discipline on when I go to bed and wake up (literally no lie-ins for years), \"light hygiene\" (no blue light in the evening, no screens at all after early evening), and avoiding all caffeine etc after lunchtime. Everything I ever found that people suggested, I tried for at least 3 months to see if it helped - and most things I tried to maintain much longer. Room temperature, noise level, bedding, diet, timing, light, routine, pillow count/size etc... everything I could find that had any chance of working, I tried it, maintaining most measures for at least 12 months and always at least 3. It made precisely bollocks all difference to my sleeping pattern.\n\nIf I force myself to get up at the same time, I can keep it at that \"gets 6.5 hours sleep, force myself awake, knackered all day, can't fall asleep\" 1.5 hour displacement, but as soon as I relax my waking time, my body clock timing will creep up by 90 minutes a day. I found the same with the above \"experiment\" (3 years of commuting where I literally couldn't afford to sleep in, because leaving home 15 minutes later cost me 45 minutes sat in traffic), that I could force it by forcing myself awake, but I was exhausted and it didn't actually resolve the problem\n\nBut yeah, it's definitely a thing, normally categorised as a sleep disorder: Circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder or delayed sleep-phase disorder (or disorders, if you consider there to be several different ones)",

I don't know what it is, but no matter when I wake up I don't feel awake until its 9 or 10 at night.\n\nThe other day I was out at the park in the middle of the day and I saw a raccoon running around in the sun, and all I could think is that me and that raccoon were both geared with sleep cycles that opposite the majority of our species.

Yeah sure, but how!?\n\nI've never had much more than 4 hours of sleep on a work day / school day. Most days I simply cannot fall asleep or feel tired until it's 2+ AM.  And then I get up shortly after \\~6 AM, because I need to get ready / get to work in time. Often times it's even less, when i end up in thoughts or get stuck reading or watching something (access to videos on a smartphone was not a boon to my sleep schedule!)\n\nOn days off my body seems to recharge, because without alarms left on my own I will easily sleep for 10+ hours.\n\nThat said every medical professional I talked to about this claims it's not possible and that I cannot \"catch up\" on sleep, but somehow my body has been functioning like this for at least 25+ years and nothing has been helping me get more sleep, but I also don't feel constantly fatigured or anything.\n\nAlso, how do people squeeze in 8+ hours of sleep into their daily life? If I do that I feel like there's no life left.  get up at 6 , commute to work + worktime + travel back home from 7AM to 6PM. To get 8 hours of sleep I'd have to then fall asleep by 10 pm. \n\nWhich means I'd ideally have 4 hours of free time each day, how do people get anything done like that? \n\nI probably spend at least 1 hour of that cooking and another relaxing, then some cleaning...And then it's almost bedtime? How to spend time with a partner? Friends? How to go shopping? When to file paperwork? Time for baths and styling? ETC. It seems impossible to me and I can't just sacrifice my weekend days off to a lot of this, because in this country no offices are opened on the weekend and all shops are closed on sundays.",

You can't go to sleep feeling like this--what kind of shitty existence would it be if you can't just take a little time for yourself? Maybe you don't even think like this, but when you stay up to \"unwind\" or you're waiting to feel sleepy and it's just not happening, there's a fair chance this is what's going on.\n\nSo, you \"fix\" this by staying up longer to get your personal time, unwind, and feel better, but then you don't get enough sleep. The next day is mostly the same, but with the added accumulated exhaustion of the night before, and so on and so forth.\n\nEventually you get to the weekend, and your sleep schedule is so messed up that you stay up all night, but because of this massive accumulated exhaustion, you sleep in. Now half the day is gone, so what choice do you have but to stay up late again.\n\nAll this time you're training your body to ignore natural circadian rhythms. You're conditioning your mind to associate the best time of the day with night time, when you would normally be sleeping.\n\nThis isn't everyone. There are real physiological disorders, but I think this is what most people suffer from. The solution is very individual. You have to change the whole structure of your day. It doesn't do any good to just discipline yourself to go to bed earlier and then feel resentful and unhappy that you have no time for yourself. You have to find ways of getting personal time throughout the day. This is easy for some people and almost impossible for others.",

            "There\u2019s an interesting book on this subject called \u201cWhy We Sleep\u201d by Matthew Walker. While there is some strong critical pushback online (thanks Wikipedia!), it\u2019s a useful place to start for figuring out why you are tired in the morning.\n\nMy haphazard guess (from my own adventures in morning tiredness and nighttime wakefulness) is this is a combo of caffeine sensitivity, alcohol late at night, no bright light in the morning, and not enough vitamin D. \n\nCaffeine thoroughly messes with the amount and timing of melatonin in the brain. Caffeine keeps you awake by blocking the \u201csleep\u201d signal of melatonin from triggering its receptors on neurons, not by boosting the \u201cawake\u201d signal (serotonin). Staying awake longer causes more melatonin to build up, and reduces the time asleep when melatonin is broken down. The result is you wake up with more melatonin left over and little caffeine to block the receptors, leaving you groggy, so you go right for more caffeine, perpetuating and deepening the cycle.\n\nCaffeine\u2019s half-life for removal from the body is anywhere from 1.5 hr to 9.5 hr. If you\u2019re on the high end, a single 8 oz (~100mg dose) cup of coffee at 8am is still 50mg in your bloodstream at 6pm and is 25mg at 3am. Imagine drinking 2-3 cups a day. Imagine drinking coffee at dinner.\n\nAlcohol messes with the other side of sleep, ruining the first few hours of non-rem sleep.\n\nBright light (eg sunlight, not moonlight or candlelight or most indoor lighting) can act as a zeitgeber, which tunes your circadian rhythm to the 24 hour day. Vitamin D is just generally deficient in people, and among other benefits has correlations with mood enhancement. Both are often recommended to deal with the winter blues. Without zeitgebers tuning it, the circadian rhythm tends to run a little longer (kinda like a mechanical watch that runs slow).\n\nPersonally, I had the best experience when I avoided ALL caffeine for a few months. By the end I felt tired at 11-11:30pm, sleep felt restorative, I woke up awake and rested and ready to go around 7-7:30am, not groggy at all. Unfortunately I also have year-round allergies, and I broke down and had coffee on a bad day. Now I\u2019m back to groggy mornings (coffee is delicious). \n\nI highly recommend trying the no caffeine (and no alcohol) experiment on yourself for a month or two and see how you feel. Just bear in mind caffeine is hard to avoid. Aside from coffee/tea (including most \u201cdecaf\u201d versions) and soda/pop (wtf Mug root beer!), anything that is coffee or tea flavored (like ice cream or candy), some weight loss pills, and some painkillers (Motrin iirc) also have caffeine. Chocolate technically does too, but only the very dark chocolates come close to matching tea. It\u2019s amazing how much caffeine use resembles opium use in its heyday.",

            "A long time ago, in a console generation far, far away...\n\nThe games used to change drastically every year.  Back when other mainstays took years between releases, Madden was considered a *must buy* every year - graphic updates (new tackle animations, customizable helmets), mechanical innovations (cone of vision, playmaker to direct receivers), feature enhancements (import draft class, injured reserve), etc.  There used to be good reason to buy annually.  \n\nOnce EA realized the game had caught up to reality (mechanically, not in terms of physics) they started taking things away only to bring them back years later, simply for the hype. Continued update to physics would have been ideal but it\u2019s a lot more difficult to sell \u201cnew pass blocking AI\u201d to a 12 year old new to gaming than it is \u201cnew superstar mode\u201d.  \n\nMonopolize the space with the NFL license and EA is not going to waste programmer salary on \u201cfootwork physics\u201d when they can just put something flashy on a re-skinned box and sell millions to idiots.  \n\nSource - begrudged, annual, 20-year repurchaser, who only stopped a few years ago, who regrets the last five purchases, but remains painfully optimistic the future holds improvement.  \n\nIdeally the NFL sells the rights to....   ugh was about to say 2k thinking of the one with Eagles TO on the cover but even they\u2019ve gone to shit.\n\nTLDR: there used to be a good reason.  There isn\u2019t one anymore.  But Game companies aren\u2019t going to give up on revenue and will always pull BS to lure us into buying again and again.  The only way they\u2019re gonna stop is if we stop buying, and we ain\u2019t so they ain\u2019t so yeah",
            "[deleted]",
            "They are usually fan of the sport and care about the roster, which is updated.",
            "I buy sports games every other year.  Not worth $80 for roster update.",
            "For me it\u2019s for the online play - new version comes out and finding a game on previous version sucks",
            "Well my brother plays a ton of fifa 15, and I just got fifa 20, and they are most definitely not the same game.",
            "Think of it like a subscription service. Netflix is the same every year, yet you still pay for it, even though a lot of it is still the same. Imo they could just drop the charade and make it a continued game with seasons, like WoW.",
            "It\u2019s also worth noting they aren\u2019t the same game every year. Usually there is a change in roster, stats, new players, old players retire, and things like that. Also, if you want to play online you have to move to the next game soon because matching other players will be harder, servers get less attention and get worse, and there is no longer new in game content. Additionally, each year the game is supposed to be better in gameplay than the previous year. There are also hundreds of small improvements to the games from year to year. \n\nIn short: while it may be the same framework of a game, it is often pretty different year to year when you play them.",
            "The words *literally* and *exact* do not mean what you seem to think they do.\n\nThe games have many changes year to year. From uniforms, to players, to teams, to new moves, to old ones removed.  Tweaks to the engine etc.\n\nOld platforms like the Wii had the literal exact same game with new player names, as the hardware couldn't handle more. But every other system sees actual changes. You don't play them, so think it's all the same. Like my ex who thought a WoW expansion was the same exact game, because I started in Stormwind again.",
            "Because they care enough about the sport to have updated rosters and they play online and want to be on latest version for best experience (most populated servers). This of course can be done with software updates but licenses cost shitton of money and this way of releasing the game is probably the ~~only~~ most profitable model.",
            "As someone who gets the new FIFA and Madden most years, it's because of the online community - if you want the most competitive online games you pretty much have to go with the newest game, and there's really only a solid online community to play against for about a year after.",
            "Is Fifa 99 the same as Fifa 20?",
            "They change but you saying literally and exact shows you have no idea and don\u2019t play them and you\u2019re just making assumptions",
            "I don\u2019t really like sports games myself, but I understand where the appeal comes from. Besides It\u2019s their money, it\u2019s not like they\u2019re hurting you by buying it. It probably makes them happy",
            "But they do change every year. Every year a little more is stripped out to be sold to you as additional content.",
            "It's not literally the same, uncomfortably similar, yes.",
            "I remember Fifa 2003, if you played Ronaldinho you could score a goal first shot after kickoff! Great memories.",
            "Gave up all sport video games probably 8 years ago for this reason. I'm a console player so once it moved to analog that to me seemed like final growth and I was out. God very boring \ud83d\ude34",
            "I love soccer so I guess I'm part of the crowd that buys the games year after year. But I cycle through 3 games: FIFA, PES and Football Manager. I get them a bit later in the year, not on release date, so I get them on a little bit of discount.\n\nI got FIFA 19, FM 2020 and now PES 2021.",
            "Every year there are promises of new features, gameplay updates, things to make them feel more \"immersive\". Some years those promises are delivered, but most years it's clever marketing to get people excited to buy a game that is more or less the same as the previous years but with some new bells and whistles. It may seem to those of us who play a lot of games that people are being manipulated by hype every year and it's because yeah, in a sense, they are. These companies pour millions of dollars a year into marketing and they don't do it because it's not working. \n\nThe other thing to consider is competitive e-sports. People want to see games played on the latest update. If you want to compete with others online and want to play the best of the best you probably need to get the latest version. \n\nI don't think it's as far away from what COD does as some people have said either. A lot of these sports games today offer unique campaign style modes where you build a character and follow them throughout their career which change year to year. Just like every campaign in COD still boils down to shooting the bad guys and completing objectives to advance the story, these sports campaigns still boil down to playing the sport and completing objectives to advance the story. \n\nPersonally I've been playing the same MyGM mode on NBA2K17 for 4 years now and i'm perfectly content with that. But that's also because I mostly play RPGs. If you're a big sports game person, just like if you're a big FPS person, you may be more likely to buy the new copy every year if you don't play a lot of other games.",
            "Also not sure about America but in Ireland the shops won't buy back sports games.",
            "Updated rosters is a big one. Also if you play any online modes you need the latest version to play with your friends/ an actual community that isn\u2019t dead. Gameplay wise it\u2019s the same every year besides them bringing back stuff they had 10 years ago, and they barely add anything new. But people buy it because there\u2019s no direct competition and it\u2019s basically needed for any online play.",
            "One reason is the playerbase. If the playerbase decides to play the new game, you need to follow them if you want competition. Otherwise, you'll be playing by yourself.",
            "Despite many subsequent releases being VERY similar, the team rosters change, and gameplay features often change with each new season.",

The good ones will make it sound big but not painful.\n\nLonger answer - high quality sound systems that can play loud but without a lot of distortion are relatively new. When people go to a show they want to see something big and they want to hear something with some presence. Not too long ago that meant turning up trapezoid boxes and a lot of times they would end up with a lot of distortion. Distortion is painful and really messes up your ears. Modern systems can put out a lot higher sound levels without distorting which doesn't hurt as much. Also doesn't do damage to your ears the same way. So, most of the guys running sound for the big acts are in their 40s and 50s at this point and they mixed on those high distortion, excessively loud sounding systems for a bunch of years, and they all have hearing damage. I've got hearing damage.\n\nConcerts are a lot less painful now than they used to be. And I hope it keeps getting better.\n\nOne of the guys I work with is in his 50s, he mixed a ton of the big bands in the '90s. He's one of the best quiet sound guys I've ever heard. When he mixes a show it's at a volume that makes it sound impressive but in no way damages your ears. And the benefit is that means he's got dynamics to get louder when he needs to for certain sections of songs. It's really an impressive thing to hear him, but he's an exception in his age group. I think with the modern technology you're going to start hearing more and more guys mix quieter.

            "Because this amp goes to 11.",
            "-Overcoming the noise of the crowd is a top priority\n\n-Many rock and metal musicians over the years have been narcissists who have pushed for higher and higher volumes in an attempt to flex/show off. This was especially bad in the 70\u2019s early 80\u2019s when rock guitarists would bring giant stacks of Marshall amps and cabinets to shows, get blasted on acid, and crank them up to 11. Lots of people in that scene got tinnitus. This behavior kind of became the norm and concerts have just become synonymous with LOUD.\n\n-Almost all concert venues actually have terrible acoustics and lots of dead zones. Cranking the PA volume to ear bleeding levels helps fill these in.",

            "Sorry, about that.\n\nI used to be a live sound engineer who made these concerts that were so loud you needed to wear earplugs, but then I learned how to properly mix a concert and spec a sound system that wasn't painful for most it's attendees. \n\nThe mark of a good sound engineer, or a really well designed venue, is a concert that is comfortable for everyone. It takes a lot of practice and learning the psychoacoustics and biology of how human ears/brains react to sounds, and typically it costs a lot of money for extremely expensive sound reinforcement equipment that is properly designed and engineer to adjust how the air flows to make volume of all frequencies that is consistent across each location of the venue especially at the mix location. \n\nIf you ever get a chance to attend a show at a place like House of Blues Anaheim, you'll notice how much more comfortable it is compared to a small bar hosting a concert every couple weeks. That's because at House of Blues, the venue was architected to have optimal acoustic for a mix position in the dead center of the room, it has a multi-million dollar sound system that was custom-designed for the space with close cooperation with an acoustic engineer, and the resident sound engineer makes an easy six-figure salary due to his incredible skill and years of experience. \n\nBut that small bar with the painful concerts is a venue built as an afterthought in a bar converted from an old workshop in the center of town. The sounds system was purchased from the bar's narrow profit margin, the sound guy/girl is freelance and maybe making a bit more than minimum wage or is just a friend of the band.\n\nEdit: also talented musicians are a critical as well. A drummer that can't regulate his volume for the venue is so much help in making the volume tolerable.",

Drowning out other thoughts and physical feeling that you'd otherwise be distracted by.\n\nLPT, I haven't carried earplugs around with me since my early teens. Whenever I get to the show, I take a square of napkin/toilet roll and get it lightly wet and put it in my ears. Water muffles sound incredibly well. Just don't get it too wet because wet willies are no fun lol. Or don't make it too small because you don't want it lost in your ear.

            "When the Beatles were playing, they would have to put their volume at max because of the screaming girls during live performance. The crowd was so loud, the band members couldn't hear themselves despite cranking the amps all the way. So, in a way, rock n roll evolved to be what it is today because of crazy girls on Beatle mania. It wasn't just the Beatles that did this nor were they the first. Many blues players also cranked their amps into overdrive by maxing the volume knob. It produced this distortion like effect that many artists loved and used.\n\nTo add, this sound was loved by so many that eventually peddles started to be made to simulate the sound without maxing the volume on the amps; Fuzz, overdrive, distortion pedals. This prolonged the life of the tubes and speaker for the amplifier. But, this did not stop many artists to crack the volume like Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, and Van Halen (Van Halen didn't use overdrive or distortion pedals btw.)",
            "Everyone is giving you overthought answers.\n\n1. Loud = more powerful. More dramatic. More emotional. Period. It\u2019s really that simple. Some people don\u2019t like it, but they also tend to be the people who are bothered by crowds etc as well. Concert goers are self-selecting for these reasons. \n\n2. The speakers at a concert give you an experience you can\u2019t replicate yourself. Otherwise there become fewer reasons to bother to attend a concert at all. (Especially because live improvisation is becoming more and more rare).\n\nTo give you an example of an artist who takes this to another level: Bassnectar. He uses only his own speakers because he believes the physical sensation of being there and *feeling* the sound is as important as any other",
            "WHAT?!?",
            "And also people absorb sound so you can\u2019t hear it as well in the back",
            "Because the louder the music the more visceral the reaction. The volume is part of the show. \n\nI\u2019ve been playing in extremely loud rock bands for 16 years with no hearing protection. I am half deaf. But the feeling is better than drugs.",
            "What?",
            "I'm going into the industry so I'm a little qualified. Allot of is that it is hard to get the same amount of sound to everyone in the venue, especially for major festivals, as well as battle the acoustics of said venue, so they turn it up. After that, it depends on the guy mixing behind the board.",
            "Lots of reasons. To beat the noise of the crowd, to make sure everyone can hear even when playing in a huge venue packed with thousands of people, to create an energetic atmosphere, to live up to hype...\n\n\nAnd, of course, the band is being fed a different mix so they can hear themselves and each other properly. If the band can't hear properly then they can't play properly. Live mixing is very important, I respect the professionals who do that.\n\nI myself, on those infrequent occasions I actually get to go to a concert, wear earplugs. It's easier for everyone involved if you look after your own hearing. Getting a venue to sound right is harder than it looks, and they'd rather be too loud than too quiet. You're there to hear music, after all.",
            "I know this is answered but I want to give input since I\u2019m a lighting designer and I do concerts and stuff. Often times the sound guy will actively increase volume over the course of the show. Once you get used to the volume, he\u2019ll bring it up. I couldn\u2019t really tell you why he does this but it definitely makes the show more intense by the end",
            "How about wtf do I need to bring my concert ear plugs (the fancy ones) to movie theaters?! But I second your question.",
            "It needs to be loud so everyone can hear the music. So much screaming at rock concerts!\n\nAlso, loud music is good music. When I went to rock concerts, I loved the loud music! It would not have been as good if it wasn't as loud.\n\nOn a side note, the rock concerts I went to were loud, but not loud enough to where I needed to wear ear plugs. My ears weren't even close to uncomfortable without hearing protecting. My dad didn't wear earplugs either, and I also didn't notice a lot of other people wearing ear plugs.",
            "As a musician I have been taught that volume is one of the few ways to improve sound quality in a venue with poor acoustics.",
            "You'd be surprised how much of the sound is absorbed by the mass of humans.  \nIt might sound loud to you, but you got to keep in mind that it has to sound good and carry to the whole crowd.   \n\n\nSince humans don't bounce the sound but absorb it. Crowd is making noise, if you are inside the AC is blasting to keep the thousands of human sized light bulbs and tech cool.  \n\n\nAnd since most concert space are stadiums or halls. They aren't designed with the kind of acoustics like concert halls, where a single musician without amplification can be heard.  \n\n\nAlso wear hearing protection, and don't stand front of the speakers. Also the volume isn't at a dangerous level and are kept at safe distance, but still don't stand front of them.  \n\n\nAlso another thing to note. Sound is a wave, the massive set of speakers are designed for the environment and their point is to aim the sound everywhere in the venue. They are put up, aimed, and calibrated in a specific manner. One speaker will only bring the sound in a good manner to a specific area.",
            "At Phish shows they keep the volume at a really comfortable level, I'm guessing bc (most of) the fans are older and care about good sound quality and know to STFU during a show. But I have also been the person to tell some talkers to stop talking.  Shut up and dance! Concert talkers are the worst.",

            "Before saying anything about this: i'm a sound technician.\n\nThere's a lot to take in consideration here. I guess, the most scientifically pseudo relevant reason is that we percieve sound \"better\" when it's loud. Check fletcher and munson isophonic curves to understand. We hear a lot of frecuencies, and we percieve them differently regarding volume, even when the same energy is involved in all of them. Our ears work alike that we tend to hear some stuff more than other stuff. High volume tends to make this heppen less.\n\n\nAppart from that, there's no other reason. I heard a long time ago that loud music makes you want to get drunk. This could mean something in a club gig.\n\n\nLarge music festivals started back when there wasn't a very good PA system. This is why the wall of  amplifiers existed (and still do but they are just for the looks nowadays). Since sound comes from the stage and needs to get to the back of the crowd, they use massive ammounts of sound pressure so people in the front and middle rows won't absorb all the sound. But nowadays, with current technology, it's far from necessary. If you know how to mix, you don't need to be loud and, if you own propper equipment, the same thing happens. I gues really loud concerts are a part of what rock left behind. Nostalgia is a bitch. But there's no reason to be so loud, as a sound technician i complaint about this a lot.",
            "It really depends on the music. However for a lot of the louder types of music amplifiers sound better when they're driven. It's also a thing when your audience can 'feel' your music. The sound you hear with a decent set of earplugs set in just the right spot will be better than without or at lower tolerable volumes without.  \n\n\nSource: Play in a band and a lifetime of going to bazillions of shows.",

            "So very many wrong answers in this post being upvoted way way up because people's guesses sound plausible.\n\nFor small venues, there's one right answer that covers >90% of it.  I've done sound at a lot of small and medium venues.  We always tried to get the volume to the lowest point where everything still sounded clear and the levels matched.  In practice, this means your \"floor\" is set by the loudest instrument that can't be turned down - everything else has to go up to that level or a bit higher, to make the overall mix work.\n\nWhat's the loudest instrument? More often than not, it's a drum kit.  The drummer can't play any softer and still make the right sounds.  Other possibilities are instruments that need to run through an amp to sound right, like electric guitar - if there's no drum kit, the electric guitar is going to have a minimum volume that still carries through the room, and everything else has to go to around that level.  But it could be something else, in rarer cases.  Like what if the band has Scottish highland pipes :)",
            "I went to a concert at the Sydney Opera House. The sound was phenomenal and I was surprised to leave without ringing in my ears. The acoustics of the theatre meant that the sound didn't need to be loud as it resonated throughout the room because of the way that it was designed.

            "In my experience, it's because live sound systems do not account for Fletcher-Munson at loud volumes, and many live sound engineers mix the I instruments at lower volumes where the FM curve is less apparent. So when the vocalist can't be heard properly, instead of mixing some of the mid range out of the guitars and less bass from.the bass guitar, kick and Tom's, they usually only mix to volume. A professional band usually have their instruments dialed in to mix well at loud volumes to account for FM curve and will have a sound engineer on tour with them.\n\nhttps://ehomerecordingstudio.com/fletcher-munson-curve/",

            "Traditionally house PAs were primarily engineered for speaking and less dynamic music than Rock and Roll. This meant that bands would make walls of amplifiers to ensure they could be heard without setting the house amplifiers on fire. In the beginning, there were no monitors, the stage volume was the source for the house volume. As the venues grew larger, the walls of guitar amps grew larger. People discovered they were able to be more immersed in the concert experience at higher volumes by being able to feel the music. \n\nAll live shows are a battle between house volume, stage volume, and crowd noise. The band needs to be able to clearly hear themselves, so the stage volume needs to be loud enough to win that battle on the stage. The house volume then needs to be loud enough to not be muddled by the other two.\n\nThis is further complicated by the volume of acoustic drums in smaller venues (less than 500 people or so). Electronic drums and in-ear monitors seem like the obvious solution, but drummers generally hate Electronic drums (the early ones are awful, and ones that won't cause injury to the drummer are expensive), most musicians find the transition from fold-back to in-ears very challenging, and many guitarist's amps and cabinets are part of their signal chain that they want next to them to supplement their monitor.\n\nI fought through the reluctance to move to the IEMs on bass, as did my drummer who was also caged, and rhythm guitarist. My lead vocalist and lead guitarists just absolutely refused, the lead vocalist had some hearing loss from too many years on stage and my lead guitarists preferred being able to hear the house volume.\n\nIEMs are by far a superior experience as a musician, especially when combined with the ability to personalize your own mix. It helps you hear yourself for a better performance at a lower volume to protect your hearing.\n\nTLDR: Rock is traditionally loud, the acoustical challenges of balancing competing sounds, and the stubbornness of the artists.",
