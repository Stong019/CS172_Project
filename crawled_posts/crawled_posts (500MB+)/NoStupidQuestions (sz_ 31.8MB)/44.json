I am submissive though so the thought of a caring, kind yet dominant authority figure drives me wild. \n\nLike you're not my daddy obviously because that would be disgusting, but in the dynamic he is the big stud, the one \"in charge\" and the one I can turn to when I am at my weakest.

The Greek name for this planet was variously Phosphoros (also meaning \"light-bringer\") or Heosphoros (meaning \"dawn-bringer\"). Lucifer was said to be \"the fabled son of Aurora and Cephalus, and father of Ceyx\". He was often presented in poetry as heralding the dawn.

Angels in the Bible are basically lovecraftian mechanical amalgamations, not androgynous perfect humans with wings. Satan should also be depicted as one of these strange looking angels as well. The Catholic Church also wanted to make hell a far more *real* image through some of those painting commissions which is where the red horned monster demons were popularized. Satan, being the most evil of the demonic beings, gets to be the ugliest of them.",

He was also the most powerful -a reflection of God (YHWH) and as I understand it, he was always with God everywhere and knew heaven intimately. [This was before man (Adam) was created. ]\n\nThen, Lucifer and many other angels under his charge - rebelled against God. Lucifer thought he could run things better I guess.  God required acknowledgement of this overstep and apologies. Lucifer would not apologize, say, \u201cLord, have mercy.\u201d ( Now understand, this was an organized rebellion not a \u201coops! I stepped on a bug!\u201d Type situation.)\nHe and all his troupe fell like \u201clightning from Heaven.\u201d Lucifer lost all beauty and became dark and falling he was only able to, finally after falling a long time - he only started to call out. Immediately God had mercy and there he landed and was thereafter referred to as Satan. He can, however, still appear as an angel of light now, but it\u2019s not the same - and he can never profess, \u201cJesus was God born in the flesh as a man, crucified and died, and rose on the 3rd day.\u201d (In case you ever see an angel and want to make sure it is a valid angel.)\n\nWhen he fell Lucifer lost all good, light & beauty but he still has the power angels have. What we\u2019d call magic. It\u2019s just advanced knowledge of things we have no concept of. \n\nSome of this is from the Bible - Genesis, Deuteronomy, Book of Ezikiel, Matthew, Mark Luke and John. Also I\u2019ve read other deeper study on this topic. \n\nUltimately, Hell was where God then sent all the fallen Angels. To keep them trapped there so they don\u2019t Try to ruin heaven. They decided to take Gods creation (man - male and female) and get as many of them into hell, so God (being merciful) would release \u2018men\u2019 and (being just) release demons/Satan/fallen angels as well.

            "The old testament is, ostensibly, an English translation of the Torah, Neviim, and Ketuvim; the Gospels were all written in Greek. So the LATIN word \"lucifer\" was used to translate terms from those languages that refer to Venus in different contexts. There's only one mention in the the old testament, Isaiah 4:12, which translates the Hebrew word \"hilel\" into a proper name \"Lucifer\" for no good reason (possibly used JUST to link the passage to Luke 10:18, \"I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven\"); though, apparently, modern translations are fixing this.  \nThe Greek gives us \"heosphoros\" (heos = light, phoros = bringer) which was latinized to lucifer (luci = light, ferre = ferry, carrier, bringer). Again, in the context of Venus being the morning star heralding the coming Sun. Revelation 22:16, which refers to Jesus specifically, uses heosphoros in Greek, and even the latin Vulgate originally left this translation as \"stella matutina\" (star of the morning). Lucifer, as a proper name associated with Satan, is entirely non-biblical. We can trace the misconception directly to Dante's Inferno, Joost van den Vondel's Lucifer, and Milton's Paradise Lost.  \nInterestingly, there IS a direct connection between Venus and the pentagram: the planet displays apparent retrograde motion 5 times over 8 years. Plotting those instances on a sky map will give you a 5-pointed star.",

That the angles were better than the flawed humans that he God created. So God cast him out. Lucifer has his origins in Roman mythology as much of Christianitys burrowed ideas are.

There's also hundreds years of Christian debate and theology, etc that are mixed into this question.\n\nFull but still shortened version. Each paragraph is a separate point:\n\nThey didn't want to revere him by including him in a bunch of their paintings, so they began to depict him in ridiculous manner. Kind of like how today people make memes mocking world leaders they don't like. The horns, the red, the cloven hooves, etc...are all highly symbolic and come from various verses in the Bible. They usually included the symbolism to help make the artwork easy to understand for the uneducated clergy.\n\nThe prophet Isaiah writes in a poem about a \"morning star\" (Isaiah chapter 14:12-15) that was the \"son of the dawn\" and this passage has been interpreted in the past by Christians to refer to Satan, although it is definitely something that is debated within Christian circles. (It's clear that Isaiah was referring to a pagan King in his time period...was he meaning this passage to also be allegorical for the devil?) The word Lucifer is Latin and means \"day star\" or \"light Bringer\" and, as such was used to translate passages like this, and thus the word \"lucifer\" began to be equated with the Devil. However, \"Lucifer\" is more a title, than a name.\n\nSince some Christians already interpreted this passage to be an allegory (or double entendre) for the devil, some Christians have argued that The devil is beautiful because it describes him as the \"son of the dawn.\"  This is where we get the idea that the devil has radiant beauty.\n\nThis Isaiah passage (in the full context of Isaiah 13-14:23 is actually a fairly elaborate \"burn\" on the king in Isaiah's day. Isaiah references Babylonian mythology (The planet, Venus, was thought to be a star, and the story goes that Venus, the \"day star\" sought to overthrow the sun, hence why it would come out and do battle as the sun began to set and also would continue to shine the longest in the dawn...before inevitably being quenched by the coming sunrise. It was the first \"star\" to shine at night and the last \"star\" to stop shining in the morning.) Isaiah changes the Babylonian myth and instead equates the king to rebellious \"the morning star,\" thus essentially calling him a fool for trying to fight against the Hebrew God.\n\nThere's more to this lol but hopefully this was helpful.

There are lots of older folks drifting along in the pool lanes, or doing an aquarobics class.\n\n2) They do (very light) cardio. I'll see them on the stationary bikes or the ellipticals, scooting along.  \n\n3) They don't come out!  Some gyms, especially larger ones, have a sauna attached to the locker room.  The older folks come in for the sauna, not for weights.\n\n4) Time in various places.  Old people are slow at doing things.  The guys come in and spend half an hour changing, half an hour doing light exercise, and then another forty-five minutes showering and getting dressed again.  That means the majority of their time is in the locker room.\n\nIt's likely some combination of the above, as far as I can tell.  I'll give more info when I gain a few more years...",

(Or is this just a wild pendulum swing working to settle us back out from all the chaos that happened last century?) The jury is still out.\n\nMy only advice, as I'm still figuring out how to work through my own personal trauma of recent years as well as global trauma, is to take an evaluation of what you believe and of what voices you're spending the majority of your time hearing.

Reagan almost tripled the national debt, and  the deficit took off after that. The Dot.Com crash and the 2008 housing crash are directly related to these policies. The same can be said about the situation in the Middle East.

The birth of Fox News. While all news sources had some political bias. This is when pure propaganda started. \n\n3. 2005-2006. This is when Facebook became widely available to the general public and took off in popularity. Facebook provided a venue for the lunatic fringe to find each other and spread misinformation.

            "I believe this has to do with the fact that in 2017, the United States government became incompetent.\n\nImagine you have a car that you rely on to get back and forth to work everyday. And that car is just fine, it's nothing special, it's nothing flashy, it does the job. Then suddenly dashboard lights start coming on. There's a bit of a rattling sound when you pick up too much speed. Tires start going flat, headlights start going out. You've been late to work a couple of times because the car wouldn't turn over.\n\nYou'd start to have a bit of unease wouldn't you? You can no longer trust that this essential part of your life is going to simply do its job. And at any point, something could go terribly wrong. And now you're out of a job or you are homeless or you are crashed on the side of the interstate.\n\nThat is what happened to us in 2017. We rely on our government to be competent. It doesn't have to be flashy, it doesn't have to be amazing, it just has to do the job. It has to keep the country running.\n\nNow at the beginning, it seemed like things were not going to be that bad. You take somebody like Rex Tillerson. Sure, he only got the job because he's ultra rich. But he was the CEO of a multinational corporation, surely he has experience in dealing with leaders from around the world. He was barely competent and he quickly left. Got Sean Spicer, he was in GOP politics for a couple of decades, surely he can handle himself in front of the press. Nope, incompetent. Jeff Sessions, senator for decades, surely he can manage the justice department. Nope, incompetent. And things only got worse from there. What started as little rattling sounds (Sean Spicer) ended up as full blown gaskets and smoke billowing out (Sarah Sanders).\n\nSo now, everyday, you have to wonder if today's the day the axle finally breaks and your car skids off into the ditch. You have to wonder if today's the day you find yourself without a job or without your house or with some major issue because the competence is gone.\n\nFlash forward to 2021 and we've got our competence back. I bet you you can name more cabinet secretaries from the Trump administration than you can from the Biden administration and the reason is, Biden's people are not in the news every single day for being incompetent at their job. Biden is a low mileage Toyota Corolla. Nothing special, nothing flashy, you to and from your job on time.\n\nBut you spent four years driving around in a car that could have exploded and killed you in any minute.

I mean, sex sounds are one thing, but to mistake them for dog abuse just strikes me as hilarious.",
            "I think it depends. I've had friends (girls) that said the guy they slept with was offended that they didn't moan, but moaning just wasn't natural to them. I also had a guy I slept with a few times in high school literally moan like a girl in a porn. It was very obviously fake because the noises he made didn't even match the movement/assertions of his body, if that makes sense. \n\nOn the other hand, my SO for the past 11 years now has these hoottt manly-ahfuck-grunts that are noticeably much more natural and actually align with his physical movements. He's also more turned on if I'm moaning, but I can't bring myself to fake it, so it's trained him to do the things that I really like to illicit moans out of me - win/win/win!",
            "I think a mix of both. Involuntary noises but perhaps sometimes those noises might be influenced by the atmosphere. Maybe if you\u2019re going for the romantic, candle lit type deal you may control or alter your responses to match the mood you\u2019re trying to set. But if you\u2019re just going for it then whatever comes out comes out lol\n\nEdited: grammar",
            "There's a bit from both camps.\n\nThe sounds we make are often socially learned entirely or socially influenced. When we sneeze we don't need to make a sound. The sounds we make are the sounds we share with each other. You may not sound exactly like someone else but you'll get it close.\n\nLaughter is another thing. All humans laugh but how we laugh can be influenced. We don't actually laugh *hahaha* but that's how we approximate it. In Spanish it's *jajaja* and in other languages and the laughter itself can't really be written. But we laugh differently because it's learned, even though we all laugh. Unlike sneezing we definitely will make a sound anyway but both are influenced.\n\nAnd funny enough, pain and laughter are often the same in all languages. Or rather pain and pleasure. Same reason why someone experiencing pain in a movie can sound like a gigantic sex scene. And even though different cultures will express it differently, the same culture will have huge overlap.\n\nSo to answer your question, we have natural sounds we make during sex. There's speculation as to why and whom we're communicating with (it's been postulated that women do it to let others know she's ready to have sex because humans don't have periods of heat like animals and we don't really know for sure when we can reproduce). But because people watch porn, they're likely to get influenced that way just as much. I would say people are more likely these days because unlike our past civilizations where people were closer and more likely to hear their parents or neighbors having sex, film is really the only time we hear it.",

            "Hi animal behaviour biologist here. In many animals, cries during copulation are a way for females to incite male-male competition. For example female elephant seals do this to alert other males and insight fights so that they get more informed about who the dominant male is. Females can gain better reproductive success from mating with dominant males. Accurate assessment of male quality holds an evolutionary advantage thus systems such as these that force males to show their worth evolve. Of course any inference about humans is mere speculation as we don't have enough information about the mating systems and social structures of out ancestors.",

Researchers also found that female apes made more sound when mating with higher \"ranked\" males in their troop; maybe to make others jealous. \n\nWith that said, I'm pretty sure it's also the same reason we can't help but make noise when we get hurt physically. It's just an overwhelming sensory stimulus, so when something feels good/intense enough, we're hard wired to have a vocal response. \n\nProbably because humans are social animals, and we want/need people to know what we're doing, whether it's because we need help or need to be left alone",

But when she snuck off to do it with a lower status male stifled her inclination to remain much more quiet so they wouldn't get caught. \n\nSo vocalizations vary between individual chimps who don't learn from porn and yet they can and do alter them depending upon circumstances.\n\nI think it's important to note u/mathologies comment:\n\n>i exaggerate a little during in order to communicate more effectively to my partner what is working and what isn't, but it's not entirely fabricated -- all based on natural/involuntary responses\n\nThe vocalizations are how we communicate without using words during sex. Personally I've always found that makes the experience feel idk more erotic and exciting, but direct verbal communication before, during and after is also very important.\n\nWe're social creatures and our use of language and yes even moans can be influenced by our culture though. Video porn has only recently (historically speaking) become widespread and easily accessible but I suspect it does sometimes influence how partners communicate non-verbally during sex for at least some people and in some situations. \n\nAnecdotally, when I was younger and most sexually active I'd not seen pron very often and having female partners I assume they'd seen little or none, well we all saw those brief movie love scenes but... anyway, my point was just that my partners varied in their vocalizations. \n\nSo in conclusion, (lol at myself for thinking about this topic so seriously) I'd say our moans and such are very much programmed by evolution to encourage coupling (that means fucking) suspect that physiological aspects of our bodies affect the sounds we make and yet we can also be influenced by porn to tweek how we communicate our lust and pleasure to our partners.",

In turn, males would usually care for the child equally *just in case* it was theirs. The moaning of the female would not only make everyone else aware she was mating, but also arouse the other males' desire to mate with her.

            "I used to be a car salesperson for Hyundai. \n\nDespite what most believe, there really isn't all that much profit to be made in selling a car. Of course it's different with the luxury brands like BMW, Mercedes etc.\n\nIn fact, the dealership will sometimes be willing to lose money on selling you a car. You might wonder how that can make sense. Well Hyundai dealerships in particular earn a lot of money for providing an exceptional customer service and adhering strictly to a set of Key Performance Indicators. If those KPI's are met consistently during the month on each sale, Hyundai corporate sends out large bonuses as a reward to the dealership. Those bonuses for our small dealership would be in the order of $50,000. So occasionally it's accepted to lose money on a sale in order to boosts the stores overall numbers and in turn make that money elsewhere through dealership performance. I can't speak for other brands but Hyundai is incredibly serious about customer service.\n\nAlso selling used cars is typically way more lucrative than selling new in the long run at economy brands. It's a flat rate fee as opposed to a percentage of the gross profit on the new vehicle. \n\nOne interesting thing about being a car salesperson though is all of the incentives to earn extra money. If we manage to sell enough of a certain product or a certain amount of cars on Saturday's we would get little bonuses. Sometimes they would even give out bonuses for pulling in 5 star google reviews for the dealership. There's a lot of side money to be made there.\n\nLastly some of the better salespeople with a lot of references and repeat customers are sometimes pulling in >$10,000 per month. That usually comes by staying with a dealership for a while though. \n\nONE MORE THING. In my province there is a governing body to protect consumers called OMVIC. If a salesperson is found spreading misinformation and lying to guests of a dealership, they can lose their license to sell. But that won't stop some of the shittier salespeople from feeding you bullshit.\n\nEDIT: NEVER EVER BUY PAINT PROTECTION IN THE FINANCE OFFICE.

Is it tested to be clean? Nope. If the flower it came from tests clean, the gross moldy, dirty weed that was stepped on is assumed to be clean.\n\nTo top it all off, most is shaken up over a sieve so that the grower can use the kif to make concentrate.\n\nSeriously, don\u2019t buy pre-rolls unless they\u2019re house made.\n\nEDIT:\n\nTo clarify, this isn\u2019t for dispensary house made pre-rolls. This is for the mass produced, branded pre-rolls, that you see all over the west coast. I do consulting on the side with grow operations that are switching to tissue culture clones from regular clones/seeds.

I told him that, and he said, \"it's frozen! It would've been fine! They would've fired me for that 10 years ago!\"\n\nI almost got fired right then for saying, \"dude, you've worked here for 10 years?\" I wasn't even trying to be a smartass. It just blew my mind.\n\nAnyway, he might've been technically correct that it would've been safe to eat after going through the broiler, but that shouldn't have been the only consideration.To get some idea of the condition of the floors, though, I was also yelled at a couple of times for taking a few quick steps and sliiiiiiiiiding from the kitchen to the front counter.

            "Not legally bound that I can't share but here's something scummy that occurred over a dozen years ago when I was in between IT positions and actively interviewing.\r  \n\r  \nHad a startup hedge fund group contact me for an IT Manager interview.  Met with two well-dressed guys in their early 30s, back corner of their spanking new Wolf of Wall Street office space, one played Boss while the other played devoted Underling.  They were spurious from the jump, during the process, they talked with callous brevity and deceitfully angled me to build computers and dress low voltage data cabling -- this all in the name of proving my technical competency.  Such an uncomfortable feeling and I'll always remember they both had these devilish untrustworthy grins painted across their faces.\r  \n\r  \nObviously, I'm getting played, caught on immediately, I entertained it and slow played it a little bit but the gig was up quick, I ran out of patience and began citing hardware incompatibility blah, blah blah...  Of course, suddenly when they figured out they weren't getting their shit systems built for free, the 'Boss' hastily strolled off to \"grab a line' in the back office (I'm sure he signaled it) and as expected, he never returned.\r  \n\r  \nLingered around for 5 minutes waiting awkwardly while the Underling pretended to handle something across the office when he then took a fake call on his mobile that lasted 5 seconds.  He immediately moseyed over with hands clasped and with his wry smile stated that the 'Boss' wouldn't be joining us again and that they need to tend to something pressing and thanks for the time, we'll be in touch...

            "Not so much a secret as a pro tip, but if you\u2019re ever injured on the job and get workers\u2019 comp, your case will likely be referred to a PBM, whose job it is to try and interfere with your doctors\u2019 prescribing behavior and save the company money.\n\nIn workers\u2019 comp, like other types of managed care, if your doctor prescribes you something, the PBM can try to stop you from getting it by refusing to pay the pharmacy and providing whatever bullshit explanation they think will make sense to the pharmacist.  However, the difference that\u2019s unique to workers\u2019 comp is that somebody has to pay for it if it\u2019s prescribed.\n\nThis means that you can still get the medication as prescribed even if rejected by the insurance company if it\u2019s billed to a 3rd party by the pharmacy (basically a collections agency for prescriptions).  So if you happen to find yourself injured on the job and the meds you\u2019re prescribed are \u201crejected\u201d at the pharmacy for not meeting first-fill or formulary requirements, insist that the pharmacist bills the meds to a 3rd party and that your doctor is in charge of your care, not the PBM.\n\nThey still might harass your doctor and there\u2019s no guarantee the pharmacist will do as you ask, but it\u2019s worth a shot since they legally have no authority over whether or not you receive the medications you are prescribed by your doctor.  They want people to think they have power over your treatment, but really all they can do is bully the pharmacist who doesn't actually have to listen do them at all if they choose not to.  They can always bill to a 3rd party and ignore the PBM.\n\nTL;DR: If you get workers' comp and a pharmacy tells you that the medication your doctor prescribed you for the related injury isn't \"approved,\" they can still give it to you.  The only consequence is that your employer (or their insurance company) will actually have to pay for it instead of the middle man they hired to save them money at the expense of your care.",

            "I have two cloaks that I wear depending on weather and have been doing so for 15 years. \n\nThe lighter one is a custom black tweed wool ordered from Ireland. It's more of a larger shawl/wrap (Highlander style) and less of the cape/hooded type (Wizahrds and Dracula). I hold it in place with a pinned brooch (a giant ass 3\" safety pin). It's comfortable even in -15 Celsius weather.\n\nThe heavy duty one is a sandy brown alpaca poncho (my first) and this is my main winter wear and bought that knowingly. I toss on a matching knit scarf to cover my neck and this poncho can easily withstand -30 weather. It keeps the cold air out and it traps just enough of body heat for you to feel warm outside and not a sauna inside. It's also heavy enough that 50 km/h winds won't blow it up. When I'm indoors or not terribly cold outside I'll toss one end of the poncho over my shoulder to only half-cover my body. Think a winterized Man with No Name or that one hobo Gundam (Jeff?).\n\nCloak Cons. Many.\n\n\\- Basic ones are price, fabric quality, getting the style/colour you want. A lot of what's available looks to be for cosplay, which I have proactively tried to avoid resembling.\n\n\\- I like streamlining so if I'm wearing a cloak, I can't carry a bag under the cloak (bulge) and definitely not a backpack over the cloak (My guy.)\n\n\\- Definitely bathroom conscious. Long and drapey is baaaaad for the men's room.\n\n\\- Like shawls, you need to create your own layers & folds when you put it on. If you don't, it's very...flat. Not an issue for the cape/hood type, but I don't like an exposed front so I wear the wrap type.\n\n\\- Doesn't match with everything from clothing, shoes, to hairstyle. You don't want to look overly stuck up or messy. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am not fashion-forward. I am quite clear about what feels good on me and matches my demeanor. I wear them because I appreciate the style and I have a much harder time picking (and paying for...) a decent padded jacket and pea coat (because you need both!). The only responses I have had to give are \"Thank you,\" \"A cloak,\" and \"Not cold. Quite warm.\"\n\nDo it if it's your thing and not for attention would be the overall recommendation.\n\nI have also been known to sport a purple velvet blazer (w/ black velvet trim) but that's been retired. Hasn't felt the same since Prince passed away. Sad.\n\nI would totally rock a duster but it's a rule punishable by the paddling of asses that a duster shall not be rocked by ye who be less than 6'3.",
            "Fellow cloak enthusiast here and I think I may have some insight.  I'm really into historical costuming, but only casually knowledgeable of any given era, so this is definitely a casual observation and may not be correct at all, but I suspect the move away from cloaks, and the reason we haven't seen much resurgence in them, is due, in part, to the movement toward carrying bags like purses, messenger bags, backpacks, and other carrying contrivances that utilize one or both shoulders.  Last winter, I decided I wasn't going to let society dictate what I wore to keep warm, and I wore my Half Moon cloak all season.  The first hassle I encountered was managing my purse around it, as the additional bulk INSIDE the cloak made me cold, but carrying it OVER my cloak was not happening.\n\nThe other major factor, I think, is the ubiquity of cars.  A cloak that's actually going to serve the purpose of keeping you warm, rather than just making you look cool, is going to be a real pain in the ass to buckle a seatbelt around. \n\nAll of that said, I am seeing some small availability of caped garments of late, so even moreso than just reddit agreeing, I think the fashion world might be toying with the aesthetic, as well, so maybe we'll see cloaks in common wear again eventually and I'm entirely wrong.",

            "I looooove cloaks and capes. I have about 7 ranging from a hooded, wool, silk lined, floor length black one to the one I'm currently sewing, which is an emerald green velvet hooded, shin length, silk lined one. I found that one boring and made the hood deeper and added a detachable mini shoulder overcoat in sparkly green paisley. Sounds horrible but it looks like something a rather garish elf would wear which is right up my alley.\n\nI don't often wear my full length black one out as the last time I wore that taking my dog for a meander mid winter I scared quite a few people of the large elderly population that live here. Give me a scythe and I really do look like the Grim Reaper in that cloak so I really do not wish to frighten any more elderly into heart attacks.\n\nI prefer simple, shorter, non hooded capes for everyday wear but it's currently going into summer here and all my capes are winter weight.\n\nI believe everyone needs one unusual staple in their wardrobe. It may be kooky hats, crazy shoes, quirky handbags and so on. I chose my clothing quirk to be capes.\n\nBRING BACK CLOAKS AND CAPES!!",

            "Most western bathtubs are designed with kids in mind, not adults.\n\nCompare with Japan where a bath is considered essential in a house. Instead of having 6ft long baths, they have higher walled baths, so a full grown adult can sit in it with water up to their armpits instead of their waist.",
            "There's 2 good reasons\n\nTraditionally they were always designed for the user to sit in or sit back in, not for lying down, in ye olden days it was because if you fell asleep in the bath and slid down, you might not be able to push yourself back up above the surface of the water if you were between the two ends without being braced against one, also back in those days they were filled manually A lot of the time, a bath that's 5ft long takes 20% less water than a 6ft one and much longer to fill\n\nThe other reason is that by keeping them to standard sizes, it's easier to produce them by molding and a 6ft bath might not sell nearly as many units, so they are much more expensive to produce, people don't just casually walk into your shop and buy a 6ft bath, but plenty buy the 5ft ones, because houses are built to\nAccommodate \"off the rack\" ones, often baths go into spaces with walls on either end \n\nI worked in a plumbers merchant for years an I asked this very question\n\nYou can get them though",

They had a giant shower with grippy stone floors, SEATS, and multiple shower heads. It felt a lot safer and a lot nicer. That should be the standard but it costs too much and takes up too much space.\n\nI'd love a bath that I could just rest in and not have to curl up to fit.

We've ordered a few from Kohler, and let me tell you that even though we have a professional account with them, for these custom tubs, they still require 50% down payment up front just to place the order.

Since we are already installing a tub to save money it would also make sense that you would squeeze the smallest one possible just to get the job done.\n\nSince most bathroom square footage is not prioritized in the west, and adults for the most part prefer showers there has never really been a social or financial reason to upgrade the \u201cstandard\u201d size. \n\nWith that being said you can get whatever size, color, shape or material your heart desires so long as you can cut the check.

            "In-N-Out has a couple things going for it that places like McDonalds doesn't:\n\n- Their menu is relatively simple, so no need for special machines or training for new items  \n- They spend almost nothing on advertising (the only thing I can think of is the occasional billboard near their locations)  \n- They're privately owned, so there are no franchisees pressuring stores to keep costs low - in other words, they can do what's best for the company as a whole rather than each specific store  \n- They recognize that better-paid employees are more happy and productive, and it may well be cheaper in the long run (see Costco for another example)",
            "I'm not gonna act like I know everything all up the chain. When I worked there back in 2016-2018 i got two raise adjustments outside of the normal promotions. The first was when min wage got bumped, so they bumped to match. My pay (and most everyone elses) went up like $2/hr or something while menu prices only bumped 10-15 cents depending on the item. Main cost was the product itself, they made sure to maintain the ratio of workers to orders but thats above my paygrade at that point.",
            "Volume of business, choice of ingredients and agreements with suppliers, and more willingness to not shove as much money as possible to the top of the pyramid. In-N-Out is also a private company so there's less pressure on them to post big profits or pay dividends.",
            "Because the wages are not the main contributor to the price of the product. If their competitors were happy to make slightly lower profits they could easily raise wages.",
            "First, The difference between $10/hr and $11/hr, for 10 employees working 12 hours a day is only $120, or $3600/month\n\nCompared to things like commercial rent & utilities, cost of ingredients, insurance, advertisement, etc it's not trivial but small in comparison.\n\nSecond, there is something called price elasticity- How much business do you gain or lose per dollar of price increase you set. Sure you might lose some business but it won't be much. \n\nThird, profit margins are strange. If it costs $100 to make something, and you sell it for $101, your profit is $1. If you set the price at $102, you've doubled your profit ($2), yet the customer sees a <1% increase in price.\n\nIf you combine #2 and #3 points, you can see it's not a big deal to just bump the price up a few tens of cents to make up for the difference.\n\nForth, There are things that are called fixed costs- Things that cost the same no matter how many burgers you sell. Most costs are fixed costs. For example, rent. If you sell more burgers, then that rent becomes a smaller percentage of the cost that goes into each burger.",
            "Profit margins are cut into by the extra cost of compensation & benefits, but you reduce costs elsewhere. Maybe the board doesn't make quite as much money, but they make up for it in efficiency, productivity, less hiring & training (which costs money) because employees are staying, etc. They're also a private company with no shareholders in stock, so they don't have external stockholders to please.\n\nIt's just proof that all of them can pay a living wage if they wanted to. It would just cut into profit. It's easier for mega corporations just to burn through unskilled laborers because there is no shortage of them. They get exhausted, quit, and they hire someone new for a tiny wage.",
            "Nothing of importance comes asking for bread.",
            "Minimum wage is so incredibly low that menu prices for some could be split in half and they'll still be able to pay it",
            "Because the profit margins of large companies like McDonalds, In and Out, etc are MUCH larger than you might think.\n\nIt's not that a company like McDonalds can't afford to pay their employees better, it's that they choose not to.\n\nMcdonalds employees overseas in Europe make far, far more because of European Government regulations that protect worker's wages. For instance, I believe Denmark-based McDonalds employees make the equivalent of $26/Hr, and the company is STILL making a profit on their labor.\n\nIt is an illusion that giant companies like McDonalds or Walmart, or Target would go out of business or catastrophically raise prices if they were forced to pay their employees a fair wage - they just don't do it and there's no regulations saying that they can't pay them below a living wage. The impact to cost of individual meals under raised wages is so small in part due to economies of scale, and the logistics and cost of making a single meal is very, very small.\n\nMake no mistake, if US companies like McDonalds could pay their employees literally $0/hr, they would.\n\nEdit: Thinking about this a little further, I think one reason people tend to think that prices would need to be wildly raised is because they don't have an impression at *just how much* money a company like McDonalds makes. In 2019, they **net** 6 *billion dollars* \\- 2020 was 4.73 Billion - lower for obvious reasons.",
            "Everyone above takes a smaller cut. Pay is more *\"evenly\"* distributed all the way down the chain. Other things also include corners cut on food. Maybe they don't give out as much napkins, and that is a cost savings. Things like that. Everything adds up.\n\nPlus, the hype of employees being paid well will act as free promotion. People will hear about the restaurant, and there'll be a spike in customers.",
            "Even if mcdonalds DOUBLED all their employees salaries/pay rates, they would only have to raise the price of everything on the menu by about 60 cents each. $15/hr minimum would raise things by about 13 cents. They could also just cut their growth by probably less than a few percent and make up for it entirely with no cost difference at all.\n\nI've never understood the argument that it would raise prices by a lot, these places sell hundreds of burgers an hour. Their wage is hardly split up between them to make up for it.",
            "Lets say that McBurgerTown makes $1000 today. They pay each of their 5 bottom level employees (the fry cook, the cashier, etc) $1 each, the supervisor $2, and the manager $3. They take $40 to pay for the burger patties, the cups, burger wrappers, etc, pay the electric bill, etc. Then, the remaining $950 goes to Frank McBurger, the owner of the McBurgerTown company.\n\nNow lets say In n Out makes that same $1000. The difference is that they pay each of the 5 employees $3 each, the supervisor gets $5, and the manager gets $10. They then use $70 to pay for all their ingredients, supplies, utilities, etc (because they use higher-quality ingredients) and then the remaining $900 goes to Timothy n'out, the owner of the In n out company.\n\nBasically, instead of 95% of the company's profits going to the multi-billionaires that own it and 5% going to everyone and everything else, companies like In n Out simply give 90% to the owner, and 10% to everyone else. This is obviously an oversimplification, but thats the general idea.",

In 2019, McDonald's had 21 billion USD in revenue, of which a whopping 6 billion (28.6%) was profit.  That's more than a quarter of what you pay for your burger went -not towards the company's expenses, or wages for the workers that made the burger, mopped the floors, and scrubbed the toilets, but: to the shareholders that sat on their couch.  That's why In-N-Out can afford to pay employees more; these companies are making a lot of money, and can easily afford to share more of the wealth with the workers that actually produced it.\n\nEdit: yes, McD's is a franchise, but the profits made by corporate can easily be shared better with the workers, even in a franchise system.

Also, just spinning generalities, not restaurant specific. \n\nIn restaurants, we calculate labor as a \"cost\" to the restaurant. Think of it like an electricity bill or water bill (not like rent, because that number rarely changes, and nearly never without your ok) because its changes month to month. \n\nNow, the menu price is something that shouldn't be changed that frequently, as consumers are pretty unflexible to change. And being that sales are the only source of income, restaurants measure their financial success or failure on ratios of what they spend vs. What they bring in. In restaurant parlance, we refer to them as costs (food cost, labor cost, etc..) While every restaurant is different, we tend to set specific barriers to never cross, e.g. a 30% labor cost means that the amount paid to staff should never be more than 30% of the sales from that time frame (day, week, month, etc...). \n\nSo, how can a restaurant keep their prices and raise wages? They have really 2 main options. They can either increase sales (promotions, longer operating hours, etc...) or decrease labor costs (this is difficult, this is by either automation or asking staff to take on more responsibility with less help). \n\nThe only other option is to change that % barrier to not cross. So, if In N Out changed the labor % goal from 30% to 31%, that would allow for higher wages. \n\nAgain, not related to In N Out at all, just bringing a bit of restaurant accounting help (if it was any help at all...)",

When you only need buns, patties, fries, onions, lettuce, etc it becomes very simplified and not as costly.

So even if they doubled everybody's salary that would only increase costs by 20%. So to keep the same profit margins prices would have to increase by 20%. Which means some menu changes:\n\nBic Mac: 3.89 > 4.55\nBig Mac Meal: 5.99 > 7.19\n10 pc Nuggets: 4.49 > 5.39\nCheeseburger: 1.09 > 1.30\n\nSo an increase but not the drastic increase they're claiming it would result in.\n\nAlso this is a simplified increase in labour costs. In reality that 20% cost is not all minimum wage workers who would see an increase; much of it includes the CEO and senior managers, head office staff, store managers, regional managers etc. So the actual increase in labour costs will be much lower than 20%.\n\nThen there's another factor. Companies like McDonald's have a very high labour turnover. Labour turnover is costly, as you have to spend money recruiting and training new employees, and overstaffing to cover all the lost hours. Increasing the wage would be one factor to decrease labour turnover, and increase motivation and productivity. This would offset some of the costs of the increased wages.\n\nSo the actual effect of raising the minimum wage would be far lower than 20% price increases, despite what many scaremongers would try to have you believe.",

            "One thing to keep in mind about manufacturing (which is essentially what fast food is) is that the cost of goods sold (COGS) is made up of the following:\n\n* Materials - All raw materials that are used in the making of the products, either as a part of the finished good or consumed during manufacturing.\n* Direct labor - People directly involved in the making of the product.  Front line workers.\n* Indirect labor - People necessary to the manufacturing process that do not directly make the products.  Front line management mostly.\n* Overhead - This includes other employees necessary to the business operations unrelated to the making of products.  Senior management, maintenance, accounting, HR, etc.\n* Cost of Sales - Advertising and marketing expenses.\n* Capital - All machinery and tangible assets need to run the business.\n\n(These are rough categories off the top of my head, so I'm sure I've missed some details, but out in the world, there's a bit of variability from company to company on the details.)\n\nMy work has always been in non-food manufacturing, but across the industries I've worked in, the direct labor component of COGS is usually around 20%.  So even a large increase in direct labor costs makes a rather small contribution to COGS.  \n\nHowever, since commodity industries work with relatively small profit margins (<10%), so keeping costs low is necessary.\n\nSo why the intense propaganda around the need to minimize direct labor costs?  I think this has three major roots:\n\n1. Executives would rather keep your focus on the evils of paying front line workers too much so you don't notice them utterly looting their companies with seven- and eight-figure compensation.\n2. Hourly wages show up on an accountant's ledger, while the cost of turnover does not.  You can control what you can measure.  Therefore it's simpler to pay front line employees less than it is to figure out how to run your business better - you get immediate results on the balance sheet, and you don't have to take any real risks of doing something different than your competitors.\n3. In publicly traded companies, shareholder pressure (greed) is real.  In privately held companies, owner greed is also real.  In either case, management ultimately decides what they will do, and since most businesspeople - despite their bold claims - are some of the most risk-averse people on the planet, they almost always cave to that pressure.\n\n(Source:  25-year product development engineer/manager.)",

            "In and Out isn't franchised and keeps a limited menu. Less ingredients means less processing time. They also buy beef in contracts to get low rates. They also have their own fleet of trucks to deliver items. \n\nTrucking dispatch is a huge cost for operations.",

            "They arent greedy shits",
            "Volume. \n\nI owned a chain quick service restaurant. \n\nThe prices are based on volume. You have to do a ton of sales to break even, but once you reach that point the cost of labor remains the same and each sale is worth more $. \n\nIn quick service volume is everything.",
            "\"In N Out\" is privately owned, has zero debt, has zero share holders, and purposely limits the number of new locations they open to 5 per year.\n\nEssentially, the \"In N Out\" Quick Service Restaurant chain, has very low capital costs compared to their competitors.\n\nEdit:  I read somewhere that in the US, on average, 40% of what you pay to buy something is just to cover Capital costs.",

            "It\u2019s called worker exploitation. And that wages and prices don\u2019t really affect each other much. A high wage doesn\u2019t make prices high and low wage doesn\u2019t make prices low",
            "Best In N Out ad i've seen in a while",
            "A properly managed restaurant is a gold mine.  Everybody has to eat, food is cheap in bulk, less so by the burger.  Train some monkeys to run things and rake in the profits.  You can afford to pay decent wages because that $20/hr employees' labor is making you 50 an hour.  If not, you're doing it wrong.",

            "By keeping prices lower, they can increase shareholder value through increased sales when competitors raise their prices to \u201caccommodate\u201d for increase overhead due to improving wages. If McDonald\u2019s goes to $15 an hour but increases the prices for meals, and in n out goes to $15 but keeps prices lower, they will capture the market share McDonald\u2019s loses. \n\nIt\u2019s the market. The doom and gloom crowd doesn\u2019t understand basic economics or competition. Competition keeps prices stable, not overhead or employee compensation. You\u2019ll capture a larger market by offering lower prices, and that will offset any marginal increase in overhead."
