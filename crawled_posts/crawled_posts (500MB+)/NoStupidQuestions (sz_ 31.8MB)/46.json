It's mostly in your head.  If you stop smoking weed when you are a heavy user you won't withdraw like that.  You may have trouble sleeping at first.  You may feel agitated/annoyed and/and lose your appetite at first.  That's because you are used to being chilled out and hungry most of thr time.  It's more of a rebound effect.

He would buy weed before paying bills. He could never smoke enough. He must have spent thousands of dollars on weed alone. He once ran out of weed and was broke so he smoked the residue off his weed pipe. He accidently dropped it and it broke. I found him down the street trying to smoke a broken weed pipe. It was then I realized he had a problem.",
            "It is mostly psychological as weed gives you the dopamine reward that would otherwise only be available from finding a mate/building a house/hunting food in the past. You can now get this reward for free by just smoking weed and it is a lot easier than finding a partner or accomplishing a difficult task. Your brain can then get used to not producing dopamine naturally as a reward and instead just letting weed produce the dopamine for it and so you grow dependant. This logic fits any \u201cdopamine hacks\u201d like video games/masturbation/etc. that don\u2019t require work to produce dopamine and that may mimic actual achievements\u2026masturbating tricks your brain into thinking you\u2019ve had sex or found a mate and releases dopamine, video games trick your brain into thinking you\u2019ve accomplished something when really you haven\u2019t, weed just produces it when you smoke.\n\nTherefor it is a psychological dependence not a physical dependance like other drugs give.\n\nNote: weed can also bring depression as your brain stops producing dopamine naturally as the weed does it for you, then you stop seeing a lot of the point in doing these difficult yet meaningful tasks and when you stop smoking it takes a while for your brain to get used to producing it again.",

This is an oversimplification, keep in mind, but that\u2019s basically it.",
            "It's not addictive in the heroin/coke addictive sense. More like coffee or redbull addictive. You can easily quit but you'll be a crabby dick for a few days and have some mild physical effects. It's more of a dependency / habit than addiction.\n\nAlso it sits on the border in that regard. Like it has benefits no doubt but it can also be used to facilitate bad social habits like avoidance and be a negative coping mechanism quite easily. In my case I would use it for pain management and yes, it 100 percent works for that but I would also use it to avoid having difficult conversations and to zone out from even analyzing the issues in my life I was uncomfortable facing.\n\nPeople need to get out of the mindset that drugs are good or bad. They are neither and both. It's always on the person using and their reasons. Also it's not just drugs but any thing you lean on in an unhealthy way. Even things traditionally labels good like working out or even reading can be a tool for avoidance and have negative effects on your life and relationships. Mental health is the issue and \"things\" just fill the gaps temporarily. We see the extremes all the time and those are just easy to identify.\n\nTruth is we are all fucked up and use all sorts of ways to cope.",
            "Well, anything can be psychologically addictive. Hard drugs like heroin are both physically and psychologically addictive. Something like porn is primarily psychological, but our minds are incredibly good at inducing actual symptoms or psychosomatic symptoms.\n\nIn the case of weed, it absolutely can be psychologically addictive. Like I said, anything can be. Food addiction, for example, is not uncommon. These sorts of addictions are not like the scary image we think of when we picture a coke addict. We keep getting told what addiction looks like, and it does not look like what a weed addict looks like, or what a food or porn addict looks like. So it's incredibly easy to dismiss those issues. The dysfunction of a heroin addiction may be the physical issues that arise, the criminal acts committed out of desperation, socia dysfunction. The dysfunction of a weed addict may be something like they using weed to cover up a real issue that can be fixed, rather than concealed. Or they may spend more money than they can afford to on it.\n\nAddiction of any kind is strongly influenced by our minds. Which makes is extremely complicated, and far from a one size fits all.",
            "They're in denial. People will justify the statement a number of ways (all of which can be seen in the comments), mostly by staying that it is not chemically addictive, or that it's not addictive in the way other substances are, which obviously is true. That said, it is very, very habit forming for some people (I was unquestionably dependant on it for a couple of years), which can be just as strong a form of addiction.",

You are dependent on your ADHD medication so that you can be productive at work or in life. \n\nThe Healthcare system in the USA is so fucked, Weed is comparatively cheap compared to going to a doctor or taking proper medication, and has such a wide range of affects it can be used as a step in for many other medications. Low appetite, depression, Parkinson disease, epilepsy, general pain, and the list goes on. People discover that self medication with marijuana is a cheap alternative to Healthcare that allows them some quality of life, and so become dependant on it. \n\nMuch different imo than addiction. Dependency is due to a quality of life improvement, whereas addiction is detrimental and usually has no perceived medical use to the individual other than a feeling of euphoria.",

            "I think your concept of addiction is off. Is every person who partakes in drinking \"dependant\" on alcohol for a good time or every person who smokes a cigarette \"addicted\" to cigarettes? Some people simply choose to live life differently, and not to be elitist, but most people who are legit stoners are typically way more balanced individuals than many other substances/addictions out there.",
            "In order for a substance to be addictive, it generally needs to be toxic at some level--in other words, it needs to physically affect the functioning of the body in a pathological way that, in extreme cases, will cause death.\n\nCannabis is completely non-toxic. Doesn't matter how much of it you smoke/eat--even if you're so stoned you can't walk, and can't move--eventually, it'll wear off and you'll be more-or-less back to normal. \n\nWhen you say \"dependency\", what you're talking about are people who have decided for themselves that cannabis is necessary for their well-being, and these sorts generally (but not always) take far too much of it, using it as a crutch, an escape, an excuse to be lazy, a means of avoiding adult responsibilities, and so forth. \n\nIn those situations, it is not cannabis that is ***causing*** the problem--it is a problem in the way that person relates to other people and the world in general. Cannabis is just the means that person has chosen to express these failures of character. This hypothetical pot-head could also have chosen other anti-social forms of behavior: theft, sex mania, hoarding/shopping, alcohol, weight lifting / exercise, steroids, eating/food, physical fighting--that behavior can be (and is) expressed in any number of ways. \n\nSo the \"dependency\" upon cannabis is a dependency that exists in the user, and is not conferred upon the user like a highly toxic drug would do. \n\nFor instance, heavy drinkers who try to give up will find it really difficult to sleep, sometimes for months, and they may lose full control of their muscles and get shakes when the drinks start to wear off. So heavy drinkers have a hard time giving it up, even if they want to. Meth does the same: heavy users find that if they give it up, they can't sleep--sometimes for weeks on end. Heavy abusers of heroin go through intense pain and spasms when they quit, and those spasms can sometimes lead to death. \n\nCannabis doesn't do any of that. A person could use it every day, all day, for years, and then give it up one day and...that's it. They gave it up. Nothing happens. \n\nClaiming that something is \"psychologically addictive\" is just propaganda that was made up by the Drug Warriors. \"Psychologically addictive\" is just a negative way of saying that someone likes to do something. Now, can a person like to do something for the wrong reasons? Sure. But if one were to say that a person was \"addicted\" to thieving, nobody would ever believe that it is the act of thieving that has gripped this person, and is *causing* this person to steal. Clearly, this person likes to steal, and has fixated upon it in a way that gives him/her intense pleasure--and those mechanisms were not imposed upon that person from the outside, but rather arose within the person as a result of his or her personal mental processes.\n\nThat's why people say cannabis isn't addictive: it doesn't cause a physical need the way more toxic substances do (nicotine, an outright poison, is the most common example), so if a daily user decides to give it up then there are no withdrawal affects to stop him/her, or make the process of giving it up more difficult.\n\nWhen you say you have seen people who are clearly dependent on cannabis, you're saying you've seen people who use it as a crutch, or an emotional tool to shape the way their life is lived--but that is not caused by the cannabis, that's something those people have decided for themselves, and in some form or another chosen for themselves. They could stop at any time--they just, for better or worse, choose not not to.",

It associated drugs with 'addiction' as if addiction is unique to recreational drugs, and all that type of addiction is the same thing. \n\nSome drugs, legal and illegal, can cause physiological addiction to the chemical itself. Other things we can think of as 'addictive' in a harmful way, but this is broader defintion of addiction. Cannabis is 'addictive' in the same way that exercise, video games, pornography, reading, thrill-seeking (e.t.c. e.t.c) are addictive.  This isn't to say that such addictions will not be harmful, I have an addiction to speed chess for example that is hurting my ability to concentrate and sleep, but in general I think we accept some level of addiction here as normal and not pathological.\n\nCannabis being illegal and people having shit lives can create troubling addictions.

            "Yeah when we're talking about an actual physical addiction in the scientific sense where your body is physically dependent on the substance and will go into withdrawal if not consumed...then weed isn't addictive. It doesn't have a physical chemical compound that behaves in that way like other actual addictive substances do which replace the serotonin and/or dopamine receptors  in your body so that your body naturally starts producing less of it on its own. That's what withdrawal is... Your body not being able to function properly because there is a substance that it relies on that it assumes is coming from external forces, and when it doesn't come, then your body literally doesn't have enough to function properly and you get sick. Anything that has those types of chemical compounds are considered physically addictive substances... And even sugar and caffeine have those properties in a much higher quantity than weed. \n\nIs there a psychological component to addiction as well? Sure. But it's not as intense, and doesn't impact your body negatively the same way. It's more akin to changing a habit that someone has become accustomed to in their daily lives which in itself can be really difficult, no matter what it is. Similar to going on and sticking with a new and healthier diet and not eating fast food as much or something. \n\nBut yeah, ultimately, if someone has smoked weed every day for years but then suddenly stops cold turkey...their body is not going to go into shock or start malfunctioning because of a lack of chemical compounds not being received that would normally be coming from weed. There might be a little groggyness for a few days and that's it. No one is dying from weed withdrawal. \n\nHope this helps.",

I thought I was going to get teased for being addicted to weed but they all understood and were very supportive. I was grumpy and irate at times not being high for the first week or two it sucked but the hardest part for me was the act of smoking was gone. I supplemented this act by chain smoking cigars.

            "Addiction therapist (in training) here. This is actually a pretty big debate right now in the field. Basically, there seem to be a lot of things that aren't chemically addictive but they still seem to model addiction. Gambling, for example, isn't chemically addictive, but the behavior seems to model addiction. The other two highly debates ones right now are weed (like OP is asking about) and sex/pornography. Weed is an interesting one out of these three because it is a substance that isn't chemically addictive, yet people still seem to develop an \"addiction\" to it. \n\nSo, to me (and keep in mind I'm still training and absolutely not an expert), it seems like there is a difference between a dependence on a substance and an addiction. A dependence is where your body actually depends on that substance to function.  This is why one of the clinical terms for opioid addiction is \"Opioid Dependence\" (I think that's the term for it in the ISD-10, which is used by medical doctors to diagnose). \n\nAn addiction, on the other hand, seems to be a psychological dependence on something. So people often get addicted to a drug like meth because they use it as a coping mechanism for something, and then they develop a physiological dependence on it. In a similar way, someone may become addicted to marijuana by using it as a coping mechanism. So the person will use marijuana to cope with some psychological issue like anxiety or depression, and then they won't know how to deal with (or at least will have trouble dealing with) those issues without marijuana. \n\nSo addiction is psychological and dependence is physiological, so not all people who are addicted to something have a chemical dependence. \n\nNow this also gets confusing because there are behaviors that people rely on as coping mechanisms as well. Some people with obsessive compulsive disorders may engage in behaviors like picking skin (excoriation disorder) as a coping mechanism, but to say that person has an addiction to picking their skin would be a misdiagnosis. Yet people also say they are addicted to masturbating, when they often really use masturbation as a coping mechanism. So would we say that person has an addiction to sex/masturbation/porn, or would sit be more accurate to say that person has an unspecified obsessive compulsive disorder? \n\nAnd again, I'm still in training and certainly not an expert. This is just how I've come to understand it through a very small amount of clinical experience and personal research.",

Im 20, no job, no real friends and no family at all.\n\nI was able to get my bike from my parents\u2019 since i did buy it with my own money and took my life savings which so happen to only be $130. Maybe it hasnt hit me yet cause its only been a few hours but its starting to get really late and i have nowhere to go or sleep. I was considering a hotel but that would take a huge chunk out of my money so im considering just doing an all nighter in a 24h mcdonalds. Im guessing I\u2019ll have to buy something every few hours so I won\u2019t get kicked out. \n\nSo basically what the fuck do i do next? Im considering maybe odd jobs but i have no idea how to find them. So if there\u2019s an app or a website for that I\u2019ll take recommendations.\n\n\n\n\nEdit: im saved!! Well not yet, but i was able to contact an old high school friend of mine. He works night shifts and he said he can pick me up after so it won\u2019t be until 5 or 6 am. Right now my plan is just to stay at the mcdonalds until then. Im really thankful for everyone who commented and tried helping. This post was kind of dramatic but im glad i wont have to sleep in the streets\n\nEdit2: wow this blew up fast. I see a lot of people doubting that my parents just kicked me out overnight. I never really got along with them, i worked at a car-wash for a while until a few weeks ago and thats when the arguments started happening. I wasnt paying for rent anymore and i did get a little bit depressed and didnt really care about anything. Im not saying it isnt my fault what happened, it absolutely is, this was a wake up call. I\u2019m extremely grateful to my friend, he is allowing me to stay up to 2 months to get my shit together. As long as i pay for the internet and my own food.\n\nA lot of people think that the fact my life savings is only  $130 is because im a drug addict, that isnt it. I worked a minimum wage job while parents asked me for rent and internet (i dont blame them).\n\nA lot of people were recommending joining the military. I\u2019ve considered the Navy when i was younger and i might as well do it now, better than never so im going to meet up with a recruiter tomorrow (already talked on the phone)\n\n\n((Edit3)) a lot of people have asked if i have a paypal or venmo. Im very glad that there are many nice people here on reddit, but i would much rather you keep your money or use it for someone who needs it more than me. My situation isnt that bad.

They must serve you with a legal notice to vacate and they can't take any further action for 30 days. \n\nIf that's your domicile, you get mail and have belongings there, and your license/ID is registered there, **they have to evict you**. They cannot prevent you from accessing your home. You can literally call the police, tell them they are preventing you from accessing your home and belongings, and if they still refuse to let you in with the police there, ask the officer for their contact information and walk away because now you have proof they prevented you from accessing your home. \n\nYou can draw it out and go through the entire eviction procedure which could take a month or three, but I would caution against that because evictions show up on your credit report and prospective landlords do see that. Make them draw up a legal 30 days notice and serve it to you and use that time to lay the groundwork for your next move. \n\nThey can't call the police to remove you, that would be a civil issue.

Most cities will give free bus passes to the homeless.\n\n- look up all the shelters in your area in case your friend's place falls through. These places also generally offer services like hygiene and showers. You need a back up plan. \n\n- look up local food pantries and food programs for the homeless. Use these programs for food. Do not use your very limited funds on nutrition even if it means just eating once a day at a soup kitchen.\n\n- look up clothing closets for the homeless in your area. These are places that provide free clothing for anyone in your situation. \n\n- then, and only then, look for a job. It doesn't matter what it is other than it being close to your friend's place or a shelter. My first job after my second bout of homelessness was Subway. Keep whatever job you find first and look for better work while you're working there. \n\n- Get on Medicaid (most states keep Medicaid programs for young people until 21). Depending on your state you may qualify for Medicaid regardless of what age because you're below the poverty line. But this only applies to liberal states. If your parents kicked you out don't rely on their Healthcare because they may stop paying for you to be on it.\n\n- Get put on a free housing wait list. These waitlist take years before you're actually placed in a housing unit so get on it now just in case things don't change. \n\n- Don't waste your money on gym memberships or hotels. You have absolutely no idea what you're going to face in the short term so hang on to that money for dear life. \n\nGood luck. The first time I was homeless was for the exact same reason.

I don\u2019t know if his school has housing but I know he has researched it a lot and may know which other schools have that available.\n\nGood idea to come here for advice.

Your first step is securing some back-up housing, finding out what benefits you qualify for, and getting started on an action plan. \n\nMany cities/states have a ton of great resources for folks in your situation. Some will even help you pay rent on a low income apartment, or cover it entirely if you get covered by section 8. \n\nGo to the Housing Authority in your city and explain your situation. Committees on Temporary Shelter (COTS) Exist across the US and can help you there. \n\nDepending on where you live, you probably also qualify for GA, or general assistance, GA is a small monthly stipend that states provide to help low income folks pay for essentials. \n\nFinally, you need to apply for SNAP. (Food stamps). Doing so will ensure you have food and access to local food shelves.",

Your life is going to get way more difficult, and what happens now is completely in your hands.\nStart by making a list of small things you need to do to get yourself to the point of independence.\n\nA couple ideas I would start with:\n\nMinimizing budget to conserve income. Don't waste your cash on food,entertainment, drugs, alcohol etc. You can survive on rice and beans for surprisingly long\n\nYou've got a bike, you can get a job. Tomorrow morning, ride to every place within a 10 mile radius and pick up an application. No job is below your status at the moment, even if it's picking up trash. \n\nTry to make amends with your parents. They may be total shitbirds, but there's a chance they still care about you a little bit. Ask for forgiveness, and present a plan to get your shit together in a set amount of time, and you'll get out of their hair. Apologize even if they are in the wrong. You just need time\n\nOther than that. Cut as many corners as you can. Don't waste your money on things that aren't absolutely essential. Save, and keep on saving until you can afford to be independent. Reach out to everyone you can for help. All else fails, the military will keep you fed and a roof over your head.\n\nGood luck brother",
            "Another thing I don't see mentioned yet: your local library is your friend when you're looking for work! Beyond just books and computers, a lot of libraries have help for job seekers beyond what might be immediately obvious.

But my library system subscribes to a great resume and cover letter building site (that also has job posting boards)  so everyone gets to use it for free with no surprise paywalls.

My profile was 100% private and you were unable to share photos via settings. They were still screen grabbed..saved and used.

If she says no, then it doesn't go on!\n\nWhen I first became a mom, I did get lots of funny looks when I asked visitors not to put pictures/details of my little one on the internet/social media.

Given your previous experiences, it's especially reasonable to want to back away from putting your kids online. But even without that, it's still your choice and your right to have it respected.\n\nCan't guarantee that will hold once they are teenagers and want to have their own social media, though. You may have to loosen the rules a bit by then, instead teaching them to be smart and safe in their interactions online and limit screen time.

I cannot stress this enough. People post first day schools pictures with name, age, school name. So much info not needed for the public.

If you are in my circle you Know what is going on with me. If you don\u2019t then we aren\u2019t that close and I don\u2019t want you to know.  We all want to celebrate our children and their accomplishments but kids don\u2019t care about random propel they done know or remember commenting on something they did. If they do and ante getting their validation from people they barely know then there is a problem. Do not teach kids to value their worth or accomplishments by strangers views. \nFYI. My friends and family have all supported or at least understood our policy and respected it. \nOnce in a while I will get a person who post a picture of my child with theirs or in a group I nicely say to them \u201cthank you for including my child in the festivities but for future please don\u2019t tag or place their name on the photo\u201d  for us we have drawn the line with name. If their face is among 10 other kids with no name we feel okay but all of those are choices. We do not do faces of our kids at all ourselves.

Like a program knows it's going to print a catalog of offerings, wants to use photos from the program in the catalog, and doesn't want to get hung up on rights after it's been printed and paid for.

            "I don't post pics of my kid at all, every.  Pictures on the internet are forever, and you don't really know what happens to them.  I've had many people I know personally, irl, learn this the hard way with their kids.  Someone's ex stole photos of his kids and had been posting them for months as if she and he were the parents, another's child's image was used to make some very disturbing pornography, a close friend's baby's photo was shared to a site mocking ugly babies,  my cousin's kid's photo was used for someone to extort strangers as the kids being sick. Someone in my kid's gymnastics group found out a profile using her child's friend's photos (that was friends with her entire family) was actually a middle aged man. \nEven if there's no risk, we believe it's up to our kid to decide if he wants an internet presence or not, which at 3 he obviously can't do. Honestly it's hard because my family and friends are spread out and rarely see each other pre rona. Plus, he's absolutely beautiful and constantly doing amazing things I'd love to share. But even as mom, that's not my place. My family and friends know if they cross that line, they don't get photos. They don't get unsupervised contact. They do get a lecture on why respecting boundaries is important, and a warning that continuing to cross them  will end in low contact. I take it like that Van Halen brown M&M story. It's not hard to not post photos  on the internet, so  if you can't get that right,  you clearly can't be trusted to do the harder stuff like keep him safe and enforce the rules. I get shit about it occasionally still, and lots when he was first born, especially from my in laws, but I have no fucks for that kind of entitlement.  You aren't being unreasonable, you're protecting your kid. Keep it up.",
            "I was going to put a balanced yes/no answer up because I think there are issues with an absolute view either way. However as i see the popular opinion is that you have a right to control what is put up.. and this is case is well put and strongly made I'm going to concentrate on why you should take a neuanced view \n\nFirstly you have been through a traumatic experience...let's.not underplay that as you (perhaps more than your child) were the victim of something that has really upset you. But while it is a lesson in what can go wrong with modern media and should inform the way you treat it you need to balance that with acceptance that bad things happen. \n\nWere you the victim of an in person crime or traumatic event e.g. a car crash you might also be hesitant to put yourself in the situation agian. People often avoid car travel because of an accident  because we are human and react to such events very strongly but in doing so it is at a cost to their freedom and opportunities.\n\nBy reaching for this more severe example I am trying to make the point that being defensive to the modern world by fully rejecting something after a bad experience also brings a cost. In this case it maybe relatively small risk vs benefit but there will be things you miss out on.\n\nFor example there might be photos of your child you will never see because people won't share them with you so easily.... nursery won't take them and share them through an app, or grandparents will not take them because it has been such a big issue they are scared of getting it wrong. \n\nIntrinsically you have to learn to manage your fear that your child will come to harm... with allowing them opportunities to take risks and engage with the world..

You seem to be making a huge deal about grandparents trying to show off their grandkid because they\u2019re proud of him and I see that as a warning sign of how you will act in the future.  You need to re-evaluate yourself on this one as you are being way overprotective and that is going to seriously impact your son growing up because the level of \u201cprotection\u201d you\u2019re providing borders on being considered neurotic or paranoid.  I\u2019m not saying that to put you down but if all they were doing was posting a photo of your son to their Facebook page so they can show people then you\u2019re overreacting by an order of magnitude.  If you don\u2019t want them taking photos of their grandkids then you need to work on yourself and how irrational you are being.  Making a profile for him was a little much but you trying to dictate that his grandparents don\u2019t post photo of him online is not something you should have had to ask reddit about.

            "I actually tried testing this with a fly I caught. While it was walking around my window I put a jar over it and closed the lid, then I turned the jar upside down, with the lid on the table. Every time the fly tried to walk on the glass part of the jar (outside of the lid area), I would shake it violently so the fly would fall back on the lid. After some time it started circulating around the lid area without leaving it to wander on to the glass part. It did try to do it again, but not with the same intensity as before. It has learned in some way that glass = shaking/falling back on the lid, so it pretty much stopped wandering out of the lid area for some time. Then I got bored of it and threw it (the fly, not the jar) out the window.",

It\u2019s a damned if you do damned if you don\u2019t kind of situation. Of course the fly knows nothing about this, they are just following their own programming to react to stimuli.",

            "There's a lot of casual misconceptions flying around in this comment section.\n\nLearning to avoid danger has been demonstrated in many [insect taxa](https://link-springer-com.simsrad.net.ocs.mq.edu.au/article/10.1007/s00114-014-1210-2), [including fruit flies](https://www-sciencedirect-com.simsrad.net.ocs.mq.edu.au/science/article/pii/S0003347211004428).\n\n[This review](https://www-annualreviews-org.simsrad.net.ocs.mq.edu.au/doi/10.1146/annurev.ento.53.103106.093343) outlines the situation well. Neither small brain size, nor short lifespan precludes an ability to learn. Though there can be adaptive costs of being a better learner.\n\nThere are likely two parts to this: I think a lot of the fly's response is because they don't need to be that afraid of you from an evolutionary perspective. Few animals can kill them easily, and the snacc you have is a boon to any fly that can sample it. They breed quickly, and in great numbers.\n\nThey are very good at flying, and detecting movement (hence why they are hard to catch). Midair collisions do basically nothing. The stakes mightn't be so high in that regard.",
            "If I had to take a guess...\n\nA house fly lives it\u2019s entire life in 28 days, so each time it comes back and hits your sandwich, it\u2019s been like 6 months in the fly\u2019s life,10 seconds for you. If they had short term memory it would be so fast in the fly\u2019s timeline that it wouldn\u2019t register for humans. I\u2019m betting all powers of memory, short or long, would be completely tied up in looking for fly women and fly weed.",
            "It\u2019s the sweetness. Flies can\u2019t resist two smells. Sweet stuff.  And garbage.  I doubt your sandwich smelled like garbage.   \n\nFun fact. Flies don\u2019t grow. They change from maggots to fly and then they are done. Size determined by type of fly.  So little ones aren\u2019t babies and big ones aren\u2019t older.",
            "i think we're so massive and slow to flies they don't comprehend what we are. their lives are full of confusing, scary moving stuff, we're just one more thing. they don't know it's \"your\" sandwich because you're not a living thing to it. you're a slowly moving mountain that's getting in the way of food. fly wants food. fly will get food.",
            "If they were combustible they would all kamikaze and the window business would be booming.\n\nAlso, they eat ass like cheesecake... i don't believe its possible to be more fearless.",
            "Flies have\u00a0extremely rudimentary brains. They respond to stimuli, but they don't actually remember. They don't\u00a0need\u00a0to in order to survive, as a species. Flies\u00a0form a\u00a0memory\u00a0of locations they are heading for. This\u00a0memory\u00a0is retained for approximately four seconds.\n\nIn 2007 an experiment that manipulated flies with smoke, showed enhanced short-term performance in odor-avoidance learning.",

            "You know how the snake sees the world not with its eyes as much as it does with its smell sensing tongue and nose? Flies work similarly, and are guided from smell to smell, they can tell with their eyes the difference between a light area and a dark area but if something like a window pane is in the way, they won't be able to figure it out.",
            "They purposely get into my house which is darker than outside then instantly fly toward the bright windows wondering how to get out.  Smack my damn head.  I love fly zappers, best invention ever.",

At least for fruit flies.\n\n [https://dnalc.cshl.edu/view/551-Fly-School.html](https://dnalc.cshl.edu/view/551-Fly-School.html) \n\nFlies have short, middle, and long-term memories, just like we do, with short lasting for an hour, long-term for days or the fly's lifetime, middle in-between that.\n\nIn another study, fruit flies retain the target destination for 4 seconds if they go off-course.\n\n [https://phys.org/news/2017-03-fruit-flies-memory.html](https://phys.org/news/2017-03-fruit-flies-memory.html) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you think about it, for the fly you're just an annoyance. A slow giant with hammy waving hands. A single fly's survival rate for a touchdown is 95% or higher, unless you're truly dedicated to murdering each and every one. Factor in that high-sugar BBQ sandwich and absence of other predators, and you've got the best deal around sitting in the table.\n\nAlso humans are sort of the exception in killing flies that land on their food. A lion won't care if flies land on its food, so it'd seem flies are just operating on the same behavioral pattern.",

Doors wide open, windows open, screens open...as someone who grew up around agriculture in California, flies are disgusting carriers of disease and filth.\n\nUpon visiting South Africa I realized why my wife has this annoying habit.  South African flies are not annoying.  They don't land on your food.  They don't fly into your face.  They don't even hang around you.  It's downright weird.",
            "I think they're more like a system of nuerons or whatever that just have a purpose and accomplish it.  I don't think they really have much of a thought system as much as they do a genetic disposition to do what they do.",

            "I wondered about this too and thought well maybe they're going out with a bang, kamikaze style.",
            "I doubt they have any memory but they do learn and have instinct.\n\nIf you swat some on a window the others recognize the fly swatter and react.  They become unsettled.  Some will leave the window.  If you leave and come back a minute later,  they have forgotten about the fly swatter and are easy to swat again until the first swat.

The latter part of your question - \"not if she sleeps with the same man multiple times\" - is irrelevant in their heads. They conditioned themselves to believe that women only care about size and experience and they fear they cannot measure up. Sexually experienced woman means that she can compare them with other men, something they fear the most - that they are inadequate . And these beliefs come from *MANY* sources - from overconsumption of porn to the point of believing porn is how sex works, biases and misinformation in echo chsmbers, shitty social life, school trauma, and, most important of all - inability to recognize that your singular experience is *never* an indicative of how the world works.\n\n\nWhile many of us know that, in reality, women do not work rhat way and that human beings are individual beings and not some Borg hiveminds, both male & female, they do not.

Other parts of the incel creed include beliefs about how women enjoy r\\*pe, how men are superior (either via genetics or a divine being's ordinance), how it's women's fault they make men angry (refusal to accept responsibility for abuse in DV), and refusal of belief in women's autonomy (honor killing/ umbrella of authority/ denial of BC and medical care).

            "Well, it is not uncommon in porn to see women that can accommodate larger than average insertion. So it's not like it is purely fictional that vaginal tightness can vary depending on habits. I get it that porn is not real or indictive of the average but it does exist as evidence that yes, women can become \"loose\" relative to the average penis size.\n\nThere is simply no denying that.\n\nAlso, it is not unheard of that some women will criticize the size of a man's penis implying that it is not enough to satisfy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat being said men that claim a woman is loose bc she has multiple partners tend to do so bc they are insecure.\n\nSpeaking for myself the thought that a woman is more sexually experienced than me is kind of intimidating.\n\nNot that I would insult a woman bc of it though.",
            "Honestly, if you're looking for some sort of internal logic or consistency, you're going to be disappointed. First and foremost, these men have an emotional reaction to the idea of a woman being promiscuous, and they resent those women. Then, they hear some sort of factoid that sounds plausible and confirms what they think: that there is something lesser about a woman with more partners. Any arguments they make supporting this are post hoc justifications of something they already chose to believe; they don't actually care whether it is true or not. But it makes their worldview make more sense, so they run with it. You'll find that this is a common pattern with people who believe in superstitions, religions, conspiracy theories, etc. They already chose what they wanted to believe because it makes them feel better, and don't particularly care about its logical soundness.",
            "It's about it being easy for women to find someone to have sex with, and men having to proove themselves worthy to find someone to have sex with. Women just need to exist in the same space as a man and she can have sex. Men need to demonstrate why he is a worthy male for the woman to choose over other males. Shooting fish in a barrel vs hunting wild game with a spear. Which is more difficult? People don't gain respect for doing things that are easy to do. \n\nFeminist hate incoming lol",
            "Someone may want to correct another piece of anecdotal evidence. \n\nShe (23F) had been seeing X for two year, monogamous relationship. She went to the gyno for a checkup and the doc told her that she was beginning to develop a uterine prolapse, of a specific angle.  Doc prescribed kegels.  Her and X noted that his penis was curved/shaped toward the opposite side, and that he was large enough to impact her cervix often. She discussed with the doc.  Doc agreed/confirmed that the shape of his penis and their sex could be causing it.  They adjusted their sex, and also with the kegels, the prolapse healed\n\nAlso anecdotally, the only woman who 'felt loose' was the one that enjoyed a broad variety of sexual partners.\n\nI do think people should not try to shame the discussion of these factors.  I think it probably just means that women who are 'sexually athletic' need to tone and exercise more (e.g. via kegels) in order to keep in best health.  \n\nIt's really bad to create an environment where medical advice and knowledge is shunned and shamed.",
            "The people who say this are in one of two camps. \n\nCamp A they actually believe this is the case. Most people in this camp haven\u2019t had a lot of sex nor have they had a serious girlfriend they got to fuck a lot. A lot are bad actors and some are just uneducated on it. \n\nLike I will use me as an example. When I was younger I did actually think this myth was true. Then in college I had a long term girlfriend, and at the beginning of the relationship we were going at it all the time. And like an epiphany I realized what\u2019s the difference of her going out and fucking 10 dudes one time and me 20 in a week. Why would one make her \u201cloose\u201d while a boyfriend wouldn\u2019t. (Insert small dick jokes here but I think people will get my point). \n\nCamp B is just full of people who know this isn\u2019t the case but also know that it is still a very hurtful insult/stereotype. And when humans get hurt they tend to try and hurt the other person. Which leads to powerful insults like this and others that are based off stereotypes and things that just aren\u2019t true.",
            "According to some random neckbeard that appeared on my twitter feed, \"the act of having sex is not what makes a vagina saggy, it's the differences in penis size. Different penis with different sizes make vaginas saggy\". No, I'm not joking. The guy was convinced of this. He even made some comparisons with random household objects.\n\nThis is why we need better sexual education. There are grown up men thinking vaginas change size for a dick, but not by birthing a fucking 3 kilogram baby; and grown up women thinking an erection is synonym with consent.",
            "I used to be one of these guys. I was 14/15 years old and a lot of the upper class men always used to talk about how they all did the same girl and how she was getting progressively more and more loose especially after this one guy who everyone just *knew* had a big dick. I ended up sleeping with a girl at 15 and for lack of a better term she had an outie down there and I immediately thought she had sex with the big dick guy because I knew at one point they were into each other. Needless to say she corrected me, but I was still unsure. I did my own research and found out that vaginas do in fact bounce back. Now 15 years later with my wife (not the same woman. That bitch when I was 15 was a fucking psycho) and two kids I can say it feels (?) different but it's definitely not loose.",
            "First, remember that a lot of these types of things just revolve around the moral idea that sex is supposed to only be with someone you are close with (AKA no one night stands). Essentially, t's a more socially acceptable way of saying slut. People who actually believe this tend to be young, innocent, or just inexperienced. Last time I heard something like this from someone was in high school, let's think about what a lot of sex means at that age.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs a more funny response; Once a woman starts sleeping with one man multiple times, it's no longer the sex that loosens.",
            "Personally I prefer an experienced vagina, and honestly throughout history they sacrifice virgins, no one wants to get rid of the town whore.",
            "The term \u201cloose\u201d is reference to their morality and not their actual vagina. \n\n~~men~~ People are stupid. \n\nI have a large penis. Not just in girth but also in length.  I was very proud of it and was quite sure it was maxing out my wife\u2019s vagina.  Surely it was all she could do to take a pounding from this magnificent gift from god.\n\nThen I watched my son\u2019s big ass head use it as an exit then it went back to normal and it dawned on me that it\u2019s a complicated piece of anatomy and it can grow and expand and shrink\u2026while genetics may play a part in size and shape\u2026I doubt there is a man alive who could permanently stretch it. \n\nTo reiterate- people are stupid. This is also a repost and this question gets asked quarterly.  Get on that google child."

            "Although not for so long, i can relate to you.\n\nI'm a 20 years old male, and i finished high school at the normal age of 18. At high school and before that, i suffered from bullying, which caused me to have very low self esteem and develop depression. And the depression led me to isolation.\n\nAt my freshmen's year i tried to engage in some social activities to meet some people, but i belive that cause of my self esteem problems and also cause i'm an introvert by nature, it didn't work out much in my favor. Or maybe i didn't try hard enough, i don't know. I made one very good friend, who is my best friend now and we still talk and make plans nowadays, but that's about it. I met some other people too, but i can't say that they're friends. Tldr: i only made one friend in my freshmen's year.\n\nSecond year of college: I got deeper into my depression which led me to actual complete isolation. I used to stay in my room everyday and only got out to buy food. My friend from last year noticed this behavior and tried to chear me up and make plans with me every once in awhile. But needless to say that i didn't make any new friends that year.\n\nThird year/now: I actually changed my college degree and moved to a different college, in a different city. So i am now a freshman again. Similarly, i only made one friend here until now, and he is older than me so we don't have classes togheter. Appart from him, i don't have any friend in this new college, and when i'm at campus i'm always alone. There's this guy from my class who tries to talk to me sometimes. He's really nice, but since we're not really friends, i feel a little wierded out when we're talking so i try to just leave him. There's this class where we need to do a grouo project, but since i don't have any friend i'm really scared of not finding a group. Oh, and my friend from last college? I still talk to him, and sometimes we go to the movies togheter.\n\nHope this didn't get too confusing.\n\nTldt: currently i only have 2 friends, but i'm still a lone wolf since they're not from my class and we don't meet very often anyway\n",

            "I always suspected the roots of how social you are lie in your family. If you always socialize and discuss all subjects freely inside family and with interest growing up with you will go on to have a lot of close friends. If on the other hand nobody in the family likes talking to one another other than what is for dinner, where is the pet, people are not emotionally available, fight sometimes and not eager to talk to one another, then how are you expected to develop the social skills needed to obtain friends?",
            "Same! I'm 28, haven't really had friends since just after high school. I popped around the country and different jobs in my home province - I'd make very superficial friends with my coworkers, but I never made friends easily (introverted/socially anxious) and once I moved on from those jobs/school programs, we'd lose touch pretty quickly.  \n\n\nThat changed the last year or so. Some things changed at my job that I've been at for 5 years now, and it meant I was working with more than one person and it led to me becoming pretty good friends with the people at my job that are more similar to me. I now have people that I can hang out with outside of work, and a couple of them have left and I even still go out for coffee or dinner or the movies with them.  \n\n\nI'm ultimately perfectly fine not having really close friends - I have my husband and my mom, who I'm luckily very close to. The other friends are a bonus.  \n\n\nMy husband and I met in college and just kind of... clicked enough that it stuck, I guess. Which is a weird way of looking at it haha. He's not the first person I've loved, but he IS the only person, other than blood family, that I speak to from 10 years ago! If it hadn't worked out at exactly that time and we had broken up for some reason, I have no idea if I'd have had many relationships in the last 10 years. We got married around Christmas this past year and specifically had a small wedding because I don't have many friends - no one to stand for me, and not even many people I'd invite in general. But he's got tons of friends, and I do hang out with them fairly often too. I consider them my friends, but I wouldn't go to any of them with any problems or issues, you know?  \n\n\nAs for family, it's weird. I have a very large family who were extremely close when I was younger, but since my nan and pop died we've strayed more and more each year. And sometimes I think, maybe I should call that cousin, or at least message them to say hey, but then I think... well, they aren't calling or messaging me either, so.  \n\n\nAnyway, no you certainly aren't alone, and honestly sometimes it just feels like luck when you end up with friends - if those schedule changes didn't happen at work, I'm sure I still wouldn't be very close to these friends I have now, and if I didn't meet my husband at exactly the time I did, I probably wouldn't have had much relationship success.  \n\n\ntl;dr - you aren't alone, it's weird and hard to make friends sometimes, and oftentimes it's just luck that you run into people who you click with. Be cool with who you are and be cool with spending time alone, but push yourself a bit to talk to people at work/school to meet more people. The more people you talk to in the run of a day, the more chances you have to find someone you like enough to call after work!",
            "I\u2019m the exact same way. I have no friends where I live, and the only social interaction I get are at school and work. I tried to make friends with my coworkers, but they\u2019re all super cliquey and don\u2019t ever make an effort. \n\nI\u2019m thinking about moving away when I\u2019m done with school in May, but I\u2019m afraid that will only isolate me more. ",
            "Follow-up question - what's your situation that has led to this? Do you work, or are you able to work a full-time job?\n\nI'm very good friends now with lots of people at my workplace - mostly just from eating lunch with them and talking to my teammates lots, until things come up where we meet up outside of work.\n\nOther ways to make friends would be through hobbies, e.g. joining a choir or some sort of club.\n\nAlso, don't underestimate the power of online friendships. They still count as friends! They might be slightly different to a face-to-face friendship, but they're still very valuable and it's fine to work on your socialising skills partly online, such as joining a forum of people with similar interests. Just make sure you're aware of how online etiquette differs from face-to-face etiquette and norms.",

            "So, my son introduced me to reddit over a year ago.  I'm much older than many who have posted he re. Wasn't sure I should comment. Really hesitated with sharing this very personal information. However,  I too have and still struggle with social skills and connecting with people. I am hopeful that some suggestions about to be posted will be helpful to \"always curious here\" and others in assisting with a move in a positive direction to becoming more outgoing and perhaps then more socialization. Am basing my commentary on MY experience.  NOT telling anyone how to live there life here - just wanted to put that out there NOW.  \n\nI'm actually NOT a extrovert.  Was painfully shy and still get that \" gut fear\" when walking into a room of people I don't know OR am standing in front of a group of people about to give a speech.  I also don't \"do\" crowds well.  My Dad noticed this from the time I was a small child.  When I was around age 12  he brought me to a meeting of a local group he attended called \"Toastmasters International\" , here's the link: [https://www.toastmasters.org/](https://www.toastmasters.org/)\n\nStarted me on a path towards confidence and improvement of social skills.  Now, having said this, it took many more years until I felt comfortable enough to really socialize in a group.  Always felt \"different\". The \"flash point\" for me was the wife of a close friend of our family (who was also a licensed psychologist) and her husband who sat me down and expressed concern for my welfare while I was in college. From that conversation I was able to realize the need for therapy to start addressing these painful issues.  Honestly, I was on the verge of a nervous breakdown and had been diagnosed with ulcers at the time of what I now call a \"friendly intervention\".  I am very grateful to this day for these good friends of my parents' reaching out to help me. Still amazes me that they cared.  And yes, I thought I was the ONLY PERSON out there with these issues. My years growing up, through high school and even through college suffered because I was that \"awkward\" kid, very quiet, socially inept, very private, invisible.\n\nSo, fast forward many years.  A couple years ago, I had further extensive testing done as part of a national disability program that offers this assistance and at the suggestion of my DVR Counselor.  I had already discovered from earlier testing that I had an ADHD diagnosis.  With the new testing the results also indicated an ADHD diagnosis.  In addition, the testing results showed \"non-specific Autism Spectrum Disorder\" along with some Dyslexia component. This testing also showed that my intelligence score was pretty high. Had no idea as although maintained a \"B+\" average through most of my schooling (through college - twice), always seems to struggle to get and keep those grades.  Was told by several teachers and others that I was \"not applying myself...why don't you understand this...you must be stupid...you give up too easily...\".  Obviously, NOT helpful as a confidence builder. My anxiety levels were and still are very high even today. Still struggle with learning, particularly anything \"math\".\n\nA BIG \"light bulb\" came on when the results were shared with me.  I learned that I am FAR from alone in how I view the world, and how I (and millions of others) react to or \"see\" any given situation or event differently than what a friend of mine calls \"normals\".   I'm not suggesting that anyone who is shy and introverted rush to seek out a Dr. of Neurology or Psychiatrist or a similar specialist M.D. that understands and administers this type of testing and diagnoses.  However, if you have questions about yourself that you're not finding answers to and wish to pursue this avenue, it might be worthwhile to seek specialized testing from your own local DVR agency (meaning: Disability Vocational Rehabilitation). This is a NATIONAL program and agency throughout the United States.  If you do, it will be necessary to register with this agency and become a certified DVR candidate. This way, a whole new \"window\" of services will be made available to you at no cost (federally funded), including job search assistance, testing, education and training funding, referrals to specialized programs, etc.  Based on my own experience with DVR, I can highly recommend working with this agency IF you feel it may be of help to you.\n\nEven 'though I didn't receive answers to my questions until late in my adulthood, having them now has been eye opening, given me a sense of peace and allowed me to also receive \"tools\" in which to deal with every day LIFE in a more effective way. \n\nSo, probably said said much more than I should have here.  I wish you well \"always curious here\" and everyone else who has also posted on this thread. Enjoy your day.  Remember always that your reaching out here means you are interested in ways to improve your life AND from the many who responded, there are many who feel exactly the same way you do. That's at least 50 percent of the \"answer\" right there.   Take care.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

            "You are not alone.\n\nI (35f) used to be really outgoing and had a lot of \u201cfriends,\u201d who, if I\u2019m being really honest, were more drinking buddies than anything. I fell very ill a little over three years ago which lead to my being isolated. All of those people fell to the wayside after I got sick, as did my drinking habit (16 months sober!). The only family I have is my mom, who I\u2019m not that close with right now.\n\nNow that I\u2019m (more or less) on the other side of my illness I felt ready to get back out into life and try to make new friends. I can\u2019t work anymore, so I got a dog 6 months ago to get me out of the house (and help ease my horrible social anxiety) and I often go to the dog park now. It\u2019s forced small interactions with people where my awkwardness can often times be masked by my dogs excessive friendliness and cuteness.\n\nI feel like it\u2019s really helped ease me back into socializing. I figure as long as I keep up small social activities like this it\u2019ll eventually lead to meeting quality friends. Good luck out there! I hope you find something that works for you.",
            "I've had plenty of friends throughout my life, but I can't ever seem to keep them. Something must be wrong with me. I've accepted this fact though and I try to embrace my lone wolf lifestyle. It's not as bad as people think. ",
            "Same. I don't know if I even want friends. It seems like a hassle. I like catching up every now and then though.  ",
            "I\u2019m like you as well. After about 2 years I finally made one very close friend.\nI know I am a genuinely kind and loyal person. Maybe I\u2019m even too deep of a thinker and that makes it annoying? Who knows. It was pretty hard. I tried to connect with other women our age but they either seemed uninterested or too busy.\nHang in there. I know it\u2019s hard but it gets better. It can be difficult to find friends that mesh well with you, as well as scheduling too.  Best of luck OP <3",
            "I\u2019m 43 and if I didn\u2019t have my family, I would have no one.  I have no personal friends and it\u2019s been that way for a long time now.  It all just kind of happened with age and having s family and moving.  Everyone seems to already have their own group of friends and it\u2019s hard to fins people my age who like what I like (gaming, anime, that kind of thing). \n\nI honestly don\u2019t make the effort either so I\u2019m not complaining.  Honestly, I would say try to go places and do what you like and see if you can meet people.  Join a Facebook group or something with the same interests in your area, that seems to work for my wife.",
            "I\u2019m like you too. I can\u2019t keep friends. I suck at socializing. I get really awkward and have trouble knowing when it\u2019s my turn to talk, and I\u2019m horrible at reading body language. I wear normal clothes, T-shirt, jeans and tennis shoes. I get really bad social anxiety, so I make plans to go out, but then the day of, I get so nervous and end up canceling. When I do go out with people I\u2019m horribly awkward. I don\u2019t know what to talk about, and I don\u2019t know when to talk. I tend to repeat myself when I\u2019m nervous too. I haven\u2019t been out to hang out with others in about 2 years. ",
            "Personally, I've been like this for years. 21 right now, going on 22. Haven't had a friend for the past 7 years at least. I often go months without speaking with anyone, save for close family every now and then. The reason for that is that I'm about as sociable as a pile of manure. That I enjoyed anime back in high school was sufficient grounds for people to ostracize me, fill my locker and backpack with garbage, etc. I've always had the expectation that things would eventually start looking up for me. Sure, high school was rough, but as soon as I made it to college, I would turn things around for myself. Well, I can tell you that couldn't have been any further from the truth. I made it into the college of my dreams, yet I'm constantly depressed, struggle to get out of bed, and am likely going to flunk out. I'd seek help if I didn't already know that it would be worthless - I've been to therapy outside of school twice. The one time I sought therapy through my university, they forced me to take a year off. At this point, I've pretty much given up on any hope of living a normal life. I've kept a rope in my dorm for the past few months just in case, and it seems it may be put to use soon. I pray it can support my fat ass.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSuch a life as this is not one I would wish upon anyone. I'm sorry to hear that there are others going through similar straits, and wish you all the best.",

            "I don\u2019t have any friends I hang out with either. We moved 5 years ago. Before that I went to a neighbor\u2019s house for dinner once. \nI do have Facebook friends but they live far away. \nThe last time I had friends it ended badly. Some my fault and some\nTheir fault.\nBecause of\nThis I don\u2019t even\nTry anymore. ",

            "I'm 24 and I found that it becomes incredibly hard to make friends at this stage in life. I moved when I finished college  to pursue a good job and it's been difficult to establish meaningful relationships with anyone. If it wasn't for my wife I could easily go without talking to anyone for months (outside of work). I also recognize that I'm not the most social person and for some reason it's gotten worse. I felt like I was pretty outgoing during college and now I tend to freeze up when I find myself in social situations. It's pretty scary, actually.",
            "Yupppp, I\u2019m like you.\n\nI grew tired of all the games. People being indecisive, or the opposite and not giving any fucks about what anyone else wanted to do. \n\nI adopted a dog who turned out to have special needs. My friends at the time didn\u2019t understand why I couldn\u2019t just leave him alone at home overnight. They also didn\u2019t understand that I didn\u2019t care for partying, binge drinking, or smoking pot.\n\nI matured faster than the people I used to be friends with, but then transferred to a university as a non traditional student at 21, and most of my classmates were 18. So moved, didn\u2019t make new friends, and the ones I had drifted away.\n\nThen I just got comfortable doing my own thing. I have my fianc\u00e9, and I\u2019m happy just spending time with him. Other people exhaust me now. I just want to live by my own schedule, do what I enjoy, and then be in bed by 10. ",
            "Its overwhelming. Nobody at all to talk to. And i dont want to. Yet I do. I think i pretend not to want to a bit, so it doesnt hurt as much. I just dont know how to make friends anymore. High school was fine. But now my only \"friends\" are 10 and 6 and its because i birthed them.  ",
            "oh my god, same, you know i found taking jobs where im forced to deal with customers helps, maybe theres something you could get into where you'd be around some new people\n\n&#x200B;",
            "I\u2019m(26 F) l in the exact same situation. I had a bad roommate situation that really fucked me up when i was 19 and really haven\u2019t socialized since. :/ ",
            "Welcome to the life of most ~30 year old men. \nDon\u2019t settle, do you. Small circles roll around more often. ",
            "I am the same.  Generally I like being solitary, but sometimes I wish I had a circle.  I also read where you wrote people think you're a good person and do good things.  I think sometimes other people just assume seemingly happy, helpful, good people MUST have a huge circle, so dont think they can or should invite them or engage them to a friendship.  I am certain that if I mentioned to my acquaintances that I had no close friends they would be shocked.  I also sometimes find myself \"polite-ing\" myself out of  participating.  For example, a bunch of acquaintances (co-workers, etc) might be casually talking about doing something (lunch, a movie etc) and I assume they wouldnt be including me (despite me being right there), or they would directly ask (literally no one is directly asked) - so I dont \"chime in\" that I'd like to go too.  So off everyone goes and I stay behind.  So....something that I've started doing is just saying yes to everything - \"That sounds great!\" It's led to some really great experiences.  In fact, I'm travelling to Guatemala next month for 10 days with a group of people I didnt know before (except for one) because I chimed in while she was talking about it and I thought it sounded amazing.",
            "Aaah, I'm with you, didn't have any friends due to stunted socialization (moved around a lot and went to a school full of white kids so racism abound, etc) which manifested in anti-social behaviour and all that. That was... Early 20s? Almost a decade ago, I had to realize my faults and working on not being such a sperg I have people I'd give a kidney to in a heartbeat. It was tough, definitely, I've come a long way from watching DVDs with the commentary on to make it seem like I'm watching stuff with people to myself. ",
            "It's pretty normal, you're at the age where others are always busy, most having kids taking up most of their free time, those parents generally seek friendship with others with children because the children will occupy themselves with each other. Kids also use up a lot of their money as well so they don't have the money to do the things that you may have done in friendships in the past.\n\nTLDR: people your age generally don't have time or money to maintain friendships.\n\nMy advice is to pick up a hobby, something social like a book club or knitting, okay there's better examples but those are the first two that came to mind, they should give you the social interaction that you may be craving and will introduce you to new people which may lead to new friendships. ",
            "Yeah, definitely me, too. Also completely changed social circles several times (work to grad school to work in a completely unrelated field). My parents are close, but extended family is distant (emotionally on one side, physically on the other) . I don't know. \n\nThe weird thing is that I see chances to make things happen socially everyday, but I just don't bother. Maybe I've grown to like this solitude. But don't get me wrong. I'm totally outgoing on the outside. Nobody would say I was an introvert except those closest to me.",
            "29 and no friends. I had a roommate that was the closest thing I had to a friend about 4 years ago but I think that was mainly caused we were room mates. Once I moved for work, we just stopped talking.\nI mainly just Go to work, go to the gym, sleep and repeat. Sucks cause there's alot of stuff i want to do but it seems weird to do alone ",
            "I don't necessarily share the length of time but I have maybe two local friends I hang out with on a regular basis. I moved around a lot as a kid and learning to make friends is something I had to do. \n\nFirst, consistency is key. If you're not around the person a lot it's going to be difficult to form any kind of relationship. If you can both put in effort to make consistency happen, great. But I often run into the problem of people not meeting me in the middle. \n\nSecond, if you want to meet new people that ideally share the same interests or share the same mindset, you have to go out and do things you enjoy. I use the Meetup app. There's literally something for everyone. Or take a class and maybe meet someone there. If you live in a small town you might have to find some other options, but there are always options if you're willing to look for them. \n\nThird, you can do all these things and some people just won't be in the market for close friends... But if you put yourself out there and are open to possibilities then you will make some friends. It takes effort on both sides. But being a bit vulnerable in the sense of opening up will help people do the same with you.\n\nI hope this helps. Be genuine and you'll find some good ones. ",

            "It's really common, especially on a platform like Reddit. People can be anonymous, and then turn it off when the ban't be arse.  \n\nSo yeah, you are not alone in this. That being said, that's never much comfort because.. well..  its your personal experience that's happening, so why do you care that other people are doing it too, that doesn't help.  \n\nAnyhow, You talk about your appearance so evidently you think that this may be a factor. Let me debunk that - unless you are going wildly against social norms, it is not your appearance. You are right though, the common factor is you, but in contrast to what you are saying it's more your actions (or lack therof) rather than your looks  \n\nMaking friends is straight-forward. Might not be easy for some, but it's fairly straightforward.  \n\nPeople make friends online through games and chats and common-interest groups. They would argue that these connections are as good as, or better than real life. Good for them. But in reality, they are not always.  \nI can concede that people connect online, but humans are social creatures. Even if you are the most anti-social person in the world.. well, you are on Reddit asking questions. Not because you wanna know the answer, but you want to know about others experiences and relay your own.\n\nSo what can you do in real-life to make more connections? Well - Sitting in front of your computer every night and weekend doesn't help that. The only way is to get out there and meet people. Oh No, that sounds Scary! Well, it is a bit but you gotta suck it up. The best way is to link up with groups that you have a common interest with.  \nI see you are a Caps fan, I mean I won't hold that against you but we (TBL) did beat you in OT earlier this week ;) - But sports are a really good starting point. Join a Discord, Join a fan club and make the effort to go to real-life meetups.  \nTry a hobby you've not done before - Martial Arts is always a good one. I see you also put out a personal ad as a couple - If you are still with that person, there are loads of couple-things to do. Also, that person is your friend too, so it's not been 10 years. Even if you are broken up (As a more recent post might suggest), there was something there at some point.  \nYou mentioned that you might be looking for a side-hustle - This is a perfect opportunity to make some connections. Pizza delivery or something like that. Evenings and weekends, people are generally a lot more relaxed and its a much more social atmosphere.  \n\nYou have other options aswell - Travel. even just in the US - Solo Travel to a few cities. Stay in Hostels and backpacker digs and meet people that way. Travel abroad, South east asia - Although may cost a little more to get there than other places, the low cost of stuff out there (Food, accommodation, trips) far outweighs the initial outlay. Do a course at the community college - Cooking, language, auto repair - Anything. You'll be with other beginners, so there can and will be Banter.   \n\nThe long and short of it is: Put yourself out there. Ok, You'll get rejected occasionally, but so what? That doesn't dictate your value as a person. If you dwell on the rejections maybe look into doing a little CBT to mitigate it a bit, but always look forward and as much as possible try to think positively.",
            "I went through a similar thing, kind of still going through it. After I left high school, I had a few friends, very few really good friends. And when it became no longer convenient for them to be in my life, they just weren\u2019t. I eventually just became more and more comfortable with being alone. At first I hated it, I looked at everybody else parting with their friends and their early 20s and thought there was something wrong with me, but I eventually grew to love it. I started to focus on myself, work on my own hobbies, exercise, and take care of myself. I tried to date, but I was eternally awkward and introverted, when it came to somebody I might really like, I instantly shut down if they showed any kind of interest. I also distanced myself from my roommates And coworkers, I was pretty much alone all of the time. I happened to get lucky and start chatting with this one girl online, we started video chatting daily for about three months, then I conquered massive amounts of fear to go visit her, and it just took off from there. We ended up getting married two years later. Still very happily married. However, I still find that I don\u2019t really have friends. I will make a work friend here or there, but never anybody that I hang out with outside of work. My wife makes friends, but I don\u2019t really have any connection with them because they are my wife\u2019s friends. I kind of feel like whatever part of me was supposed to be interested in making friends or know how to do it died off along time ago.

I don\u2019t always keep up with people, so I know I\u2019ve lost some along the way. \n\nAnd when you\u2019re single, or, at my age, without a wife and kids (I do have a gf who is a social butterfly; it\u2019s interesting to see the dichotomy of our social lives), you get more wedged off. It\u2019s not intentional on anyone\u2019s part, I believe. But it happens.\n\nIf you are looking to make friends, I suggest checking out something like Meetup.com (if you\u2019re in the US). It can help you find groups with similar interests and hobbies. From there, if you choose to, you can pick up some friends. I know there are people in the same boat on that site. I go there when I\u2019m looking for a new passion.",
            "You're not alone. I'm (36f) relatively friendless. I don't make friends easily and recently moved to another state. I have yet to find any meaningful friendships.",
            "Most nice, normal, intelligent people your age are going to be lonely because most people your age are not nice, normal, or intelligent.\n\n",
            "My wife is my only friend outside of internet friends, and I'm ok with that.",
            "I\u2019m 21F and I haven\u2019t had any friends in a while and I only just realized it now when my best friend and I drifted apart. It kinda ate me up a bit. If you ever need someone to chit chat with girl I gotchu. ",
            "So not sure what area of the world your in. But I moved around alot and would always see what meetup.com had to offer.  They ahve everything from board game groups to single groups it seems.\n\n I have noticed as I got older my number of friends dimmed while the quality got better. \n\nLife is long there will be periods of loneliness",
            "There's lots of online communities such as discord, full of casual conversation.\n\nI hang out in a bunch, it makes the day go by faster.",
            "I\u2019m exactly the same! I have some colleagues that I chat to at work but no real friends. Dont usually go outside at all and binge watch tv shows or youtube. I have a small family but we have a good enough relationship and I guess it\u2019s fine for me.\nFor the longest time I\u2019ve always thought there is something wrong with me and this is a problem to be fixed, but you know what? I\u2019m actually ok with my life. I\u2019m a good person and I\u2019m satisfied with my life right now. I do not necessarily need super close friends to be happy. Honestly being around people is exhausting and I\u2019m genuinely happy by myself. \nSo yeah dont worry too much! ",

            "32 M, not really had a real social life since 2010. Been single since 2005. I only have 2 or 3 online acquaintances I really can't answer to how to start again, cause I'm at the acceptance stage of my loneliness and also have no clue. I do have a good relationship with some family members though.",
            "Same party here girl. I have coworker friends (forced to with a team setting), one friend from high school and that I occasionally see and a few family that I don't talk to or see much ever. \nAm I lonely? Yes. It's HARD to make friends outside of work. \nBut I have lots of pets so I've really just replaced people in my life with animals because they're less drama. Get yourself a dog! ",
            "i think when you're old, if you want to have a friend, you just have to choose someone you like and if they like you even a little bit in return, then you just have to treat them like you're already their true friend and always make time for them at least once per two weeks. its difficult to make friends nowadays because often people prefer theor own company and just browse the internet. so you have to make an effort. \n\n\n",

            "I definitely identify with this. I find it difficult too because it\u2019s easy to make friends with others can introduce you to their circle. It\u2019s hard when you have to insert yourself into others circles. And as you said, I feel like I\u2019m normal but for some reason it\u2019s very hard to find a circle of friends. ",
            "Seek help, socialization helps deter depression. Find someone to talk to and get out and enjoy life and meet people. Sometimes changing a job helps a lot. ",
            "It gets harder and harder to make friends as you get older. A lot of the people I meet already have a solid friend group and it\u2019s hard to penetrate that as an outsider. One of my biggest regrets is not doing more in my college years to make good friends. I have one person right now I could call a good friend but I wouldn\u2019t really consider us to be super close just because she has a tight knit friend group already so it\u2019s difficult to find time for new friends even if we get along really well. \n\nI think making friends is the same as looking for a relationship. You\u2019ve just got to put yourself out there and find people who you get along with reasonably well and spend enough time together to form a lasting friendship. I\u2019m not really sure how to do it tbh. My friendships are from work, where I\u2019m most comfortable with myself (weird I know, it\u2019s the one area I\u2019m confident in myself).\n\nI think it\u2019s probably doable if you put yourself out more, but as an introvert who doesn\u2019t go out much it\u2019s no surprise that I don\u2019t have a lot of friends. However I don\u2019t regret that; that just means I get to take my time and pick a quality friend over socializing and having a lot of friends I may not necessarily be close to.",
            "I haven\u2019t had any friends since high school, (about 5 years) since realizing they weren\u2019t really my friends. I guess I\u2019m in the same boat as you, just hoping that I\u2019ll meet someone at a new job or the like. You\u2019re not alone!",
            "Social dance helped me.",
            "I was just having myself a little meltdown about this last night actually. It's really hard to feel like you matter to so few people. I live in a different state from my mom now, but she is truly my best friend. To be so far from her while also feeling so isolated here is kind of soul crushing. I'm 28, it's comforting to know I'm not alone in this at my age. I feel like the weird girl in high school who no one wants to talk to."
