            "Ex-hydrographer here. I worked for the Office of Coast Survey, OCS, of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, in the US. I do not currently work for them.\n\nIt is fair to say that much of the ocean is mapped, just really poorly. There are a lot of good reasons for that, the biggest one being that it's REALLY expensive. Just speaking about the US, when I left NOAA, the estimate was that at current levels of funding and technology it would take 125 years to survey the entire coastal waters out to the 3 mile limit. What funding we had was almost entirely focused on areas that were deemed critical, namely economically important areas. Those areas needed to be resurveyed much more frequently than a 125 year cycle would allow because the ocean bottom is constantly changing and shoals can move, particularly after big storms and in sandy areas. If you want to learn more about survey priorities check out [National Hydrographic Survey Priorities](https://nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/publications/national-hydrographic-survey-priorities.html)\n\nSurvey technology also matters a LOT when determining whether an area is 'mapped'. One project I worked on was updating a chart that had 100 year old data sources. At that time, data was all from lead lines. Literally a rope lowered over the side of the boat with knots in it to measure water depth. Excellent vertical precision, low positional accuracy, and the biggest problem is that unless you happen to drop the line exactly on top of a rock or shoal, you WILL completely miss mapping dangers to navigation that would destroy a boat. Single-beam Echosounders (SBES) are much better as they allow you to 'see' a larger area and record the highest point with that area, but still miss a lot. Resolution and coverage remains low. Multibeam Echosounders are freaking awesome marvels of tech. They give great coverage and allow hydrographers to use some cool statistical techniques/software to create very accurate three dimensional maps of the ocean floor. Resolution is still an issue though. The deeper the water, the lower the resolution. In shallow interior waters resolution might be as high as 0.25 meters, but in deeper waters, depending on the echosounder, it might be 100+ meter resolution. Side Scan Sonars are another beast entirely. They can be equated to taking a picture of the bottom. Typically they can give you much better coverage and resolution, but much lower accuracy. There are other even newer technologies, but they aren't as widely adopted yet. For more details with good diagrams check out: [Age of Survey and Nautical Charts](https://nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/updates/what-does-the-age-of-the-survey-mean-for-nautical-charts/).\n\nEverything mentioned above is also highly dependent on accurate positioning systems. GPS is a start, but not enough on it's own. Tides make vertical positioning incredibly complex. If I say there is a rock 1 meter below the surface, does that mean at high tide, low tide, or somewhere in between? What was the exact tide level when I measured? What is the tide level when you are deciding whether your boat will hit said rock? Survey ship orientation also matters. The ocean is in constant motion and causes the survey vessel to move with it. Every motion of the vessel must be tracked with reference to the earth's surface so that every measured value can be corrected. Speaking of corrections, If you think back to your grade school physics classes, you might remember that waves (light and sound) refract when they travel through mediums of different density. Echosounders use sound reflected off the ocean bottom and must compensate for different density layers in the water column that cause the sound to refract or bend.\n\nThis is getting a little longer than I thought it would be and I've really only scratched the surface of the topic. As you can tell, I think this stuff is fascinating and love to talk about it. I'll leave you with a few thoughts to tie it to the original question. There is still A LOT to discover under the surface of the ocean, but it's expensive to explore. Currently the Okeanos Explorer is the only NOAA vessel dedicated to ocean exploration (other vessels are dedicated to survey of the shore for navigation). New things are still being discovered.\n\nNew discoveries made during the [Maiden Voyage of the Okeanos Explorer](https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/ex10years/stories/index-satal.html)\n\n[Homepage for the Okeanos Explorer](https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/okeanos/welcome.html)\n\nCheck out NOAA's survey data: [NOAA Bathymetric Data Explorer](https://maps.ngdc.noaa.gov/viewers/bathymetry/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: High quality survey and mapping work is exacting, expensive, and not as high resolution as you might expect.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Another great look at the history of ocean survey in the US is [The Surveyors: Charting America's Course](https://celebrating200years.noaa.gov/surveyors.html). It's a 27 minute long video produced by NOAA as part of it's 200 year celebration.\n\nEDIT2: Thanks for the awards y'all. Shout out to u/YaksAreCool for pointing out that the Okeanos Explorer also live streams all of the dives performed by it's ROV Deep Discoverer. They do a lot of public outreach in addition to their research and exploration.\n\nAlso fixed typos.\n\nEDIT3: There were some requests for more links so here are a couple more to check out.\n\n[Charted Wrecks and other Dangers](https://wrecks.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/viewer/)\n\n[Favorite Hurricane Tracking Site](https://spaghettimodels.com/)\n\n[Video page for Teledyne Marine](https://www.video.teledynemarine.com/page/RESON)",

            "There is a case of a man in the U.S who was falsely accused of murder, was sentenced to death row, and in the fear of dying for a crime he did not do, he overtook a guard at a rest stop during transport to a transfer\nFacility and escaped. Now, later he won his appeals and his original sentence was reversed. He would have immediately been released, but because of the escape charges, he was held for months before the court finally upheld the decision that because he would never have been in jail if he had gotten a fair trial, he should be acquitted of the escape charges. So, basically, it all depends on circumstance, criminal history, and of course geographic location. Florida was the state who decided to grant this inmate leniency. if it were Texas that had the pending escape charge, I am quite sure he would still be in jail today, an innocent man.",

            "Mostly, yes in the US. Either netflix or hulu, i forget which just released a series that covers juvenile offenders who were sentenced to life without trying to appeal the sentencing because the Supreme Court ruled that it is unconstitutional to subject minors to life without parole except in extreme cases. One of the people they cover actually did escape prison which would make his appeal so difficult, even though the crime he was put in for was less severe than some other people who got appeals of convictions under the same decision, post conviction lawyers did not want to take it. \n\nStates are not required to provide offenders with lawyers post conviction. Some states have offices set up to help, but some dont. So even to get that appeal is difficult. \n\nThe timing of your escape vs. The timing of when you're proven innocent would change this as well. Also your criminal record prior to the original, vacated conviction. There's a lot that would go into it, but generally, yes you would probably be punished in some way for escape in the US.",

It\u2019s also a law that states it\u2019s illegal to break out of prison, the law explains even if wrongfully imprisoned it\u2019s illegal.

Even without an exception if you escape to prove your innocence you may be able to argue it was a crime of necessity depending on the jurisdiction.

There\u2019s also the possibility of a pardon (acceptance of which is actually an admission of guilt) and a suspended sentence. Finally, there\u2019s also the possibility of jury nullification, where a jury believes the defendant has been proven guilty but they decide to acquit anyway in the interests of justice, but that\u2019s generally frowned up (there\u2019s an ugly history of jury nullification in the US, all white juries would often acquit white supremacists of heinous crimes against black people even when the defendant had been proven guilty). Although if a prosecutor insisted on prosecuting the case you could make an argument justifying this extreme remedy. \n\nBut short answer is it possible the system could throw the book at someone in this scenario? Yes, it\u2019s possible. Not likely, but possible.",
            "I feel the fact they were found innocent will be factored in whether the person should be punished for escaping prison. I have heard of cases where lesser infractions were excused when the person is pardoned for a bigger crime.

All they care about is determining if the level of proof reaches a certain standard. In a criminal case that standard is \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" There is a possibility that some one could not commit a crime, but there is enough evidence to meet that standard. Then the conviction would be legal and not a mistake in the eyes of the law. This is why the verdict a court gives is not \"guilty\" or \"innocent\" but instead \"guilty\" or \"not guilty\". The courts didn't actually find you innocent, they just found they did not have sufficient evidence to meet the standard of conviction.\n\nNow say there was so sort of misconduct like the police or prosecutor falsifying evidence or something like that.

            "The atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki contained many orders of magnitude less fissile material than Chernobyl.\n\nAn atomic bomb uses a small amount of fissile material (like, 100 lbs or so) to generate one big explosion. A nuclear reactor stocks large amounts of fissile material. The idea with a nuclear reactor is that you constantly have a chain reaction happening, but the excess heat generated by the chain reaction is absorbed by water. That water boils and turns turbines, and that's how you generate power. The core can't overheat as long as the fuel stays in water.\n\nChernobyl, partially due to design flaws and partially due to the operators fucking up, exploded. And when a reactor explodes, it's a lot harder to keep the radioactive material cold.",
            "When you fart in a room, it goes away fairly quick. \n\nWhen you shit in a room, it will smell for awhile.",
            "The short version is that a bomb isn't remotely comparable to a nuclear reactor in terms of radiation released, and the force of a bomb exploding spreads the radioactive material a lot thinner across a much wider area.  As a result, it disperses more readily.  There are other factors too, of course, but I'm no physicist.",
            "In a very tiny nutshell: Fallout. \n\nThe atom bombs were air bursts of a few kg of nuclear material and produced next to no fallout.\n\nIn Chernobyl a reactor core consisting of over a hundred tons of nuclear material burned over several weeks and spread gigantic amounts of fallout over the area.",
            "I grew up in Hiroshima went to school in visual sight of ground zero. As a lot of other people have said. This has a lot of answers but I will try to run them down as best I can.\n\n1: Bombs as others have point out put out radiation once, spread it out and the half life is actually quite short.\n\n2: Nuclear reactors keep putting out radiation. That\u2019s why you have to \u201cEntomb\u201d them. (I don\u2019t think I spells that correctly)\n\n3: There was a concerted clean up effects in Hiroshima. Pretty much all the top soil was scraped up and dumped into the ocean.\n\n4: Actually Nagasaki was kind of a miss when it was bombed. It was still heavily damaged but the destruction was just not comparable to Hiroshima.\n\n5: Now for the one that many people argue about and get mad at.\n\nNuclear fallout and radiation from Nuclear weapons is/was purposefully made to seam much worse then it was (And that\u2019s from someone who\u2019s grandfather/grandmother both suffer radiation sickness)\n\nThe deadly radiation is more or less gone in a few days. After that the background radiation will effect health but not in a way that would stop people from living in an area, you just have higher changes of health complications.",
            "The area around Chernobyl is habitable. People currently live in the 'exclusion zone'. The unexploded reactors at Chernobyl continued operating into the 1990's. The Chernobyl site is a tourist attraction; Top Gear even visited for their show in 2014.\n\nThere are still places where undecayed nuclear fuel is present, especially in the exploded unit itself. If humans had a reason to build a metropolis there, we could invest in additional cleanup and do it. As it is, the exclusion zone has become a thriving wildlife preserve.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samosely\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant\n\nhttps://www.science.org/content/article/humans-are-worse-radiation-chernobyl-animals-study-finds",
            "After a nuclear explosion, 98% of radioactive pollutants decay within the first 48h after the strike. Additionally, the soil around Hiroshima and Nagasaki was removed to reduce the radioactivity levels.\n\nIn Chernobyl, a nuclear reactor exploded. These pollutants take significantly longer to decay, plus the area was essentially just left alone.",
            "It's because of the level of contamination and the quantity of radioactive material that caused the contamination. \n\nNuclear and Atomic weapons are, by a quirk of their design, inherently very clean weapons. The fissile or reactive materials used to generate their destructive power are A) very, very expensive, and/or B) very, very rare and hard to find/produce. Nuclear reactors don't need to be that efficient, because their isotopes are easy to get hold of and don't need to be very pure to really do a whole lot of work, but because we're not blowing it up and it's able to be contained relatively well, we just store huge amounts of it in one spot which, kinda is stupid, but hey it works as long as we follow the proper safety protocols.   \nFor the example of the bombs used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Plutonium and Uranium cores were enriched to ridiculous degrees, which is to say the atoms were 'sorted' to extract the most desirable isotopes, and these desirable isotopes only make up about .5-1% of the actually usable fissile uranium. Plutonium is the highest-atomic weight element that can naturally exist, and it's also incredibly rare(existing in quantities as low as a few parts per *trillion* in natural deposits) making it almost exclusively man-made element for fission through Breeding, and not only is it difficult to produce, but it's also a potent Beta and Gamma emitter so it's dangerous to handle, and it's long half-life of upwards of 80 million years means it will pretty much fuck up anywhere it gets out forever.   \n\n\nFor this reason, atomic and nuclear weapons are designed to be not only as *powerful* as possible, but also as *efficient* as possible. The chain reactions are carefully calculated to generate the best efficiency of mass-energy-conversion possible, with the lowest amount of reactive material possible. This is also partly why they are so powerful in the first place... the Fat Man is estimated to have reached an efficiency of 17% Mass Conversion, which is to say that nearly 1/5 of the entire mass of the plutonium core was converted directly into pure energy, and modern nuclear armaments are more efficient than that, with theoretical numbers approaching 40-50%, but it's hard to say how accurate those are without testing. The Castle Bravo device from my research was estimated to be a 20-25% Mass-Energy Efficiency, no telling how accurate that is.. but on the topic of Castle Bravo, that atoll is still uninhabitable, and now we get into the next reason that Hiroshima and Nagasaki are perfectly safe, while Pripyat is not: Contamination level.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChernobyl, and Castle Bravo, occurred right on the ground. Hiroshima and Nagasaki were Air-Burst events well above the ground, so not only did the reaction in the blast reduce the proportion of long-lived dangerous isotopes, but it also spread them out over a very huge area, reducing the contamination. In the case of Chernobyl, *tremendous* amounts of fissile-critical material was released at ground-level, and was able to mix not only with ground water, but also topsoil and get blown around in a colossal toxic death-cloud of radioactive dust and smoke from the fires. It got everywhere, and there was no chain reaction to speed-up the decay of the more long-lived radioactive elements, but it also happened in a very small area. The concentration of radioactive contamination is extremely high around Chernobyl and Pripyat, and it's high enough that touching the grass and then your face without washing your hands can pose a risk of you accidentally ingesting or inhaling long-lasting Alpha and Beta emitters. You also have the Elephants Foot, and the other instances of Corium, which are huge chunks of radioactive material that basically keep feeding and breeding themselves in a self-sustaining chain reaction of sub-criticality. Those Corium chunks will last for millions, if not billions, of years, and still be just as dangerous.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe last part is the Alpha and Beta emitters. Alpha radiation can be stopped by your skin or clothing, and Beta radiation can be stopped by both at a distance. The danger of Chernobyl is that those Alpha and Beta emitters are *everywhere*. And that's not to be taken lightly. They really are absolutely everywhere. They're in the water, the plants, the animals, the soil, and in the dust the wind kicks into the air. Outside your body they're not dangerous, but once ingested or breathed in they will wreak havoc on your organs and kill you from the inside out, and the worst part is a lot of these isotopes are Calcium, Iodine, or other bio-available metals that your body will gladly use for things like your bones or your metabolism because it already uses the non-radioactive ones, and these isotopes can have half-lives of tens, hundreds, or thousands of years. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's why Nagasaki and Hiroshima are safe, and Chernobyl/Pripyat isn't.",

            "\"The fire we are watching is giving off twice the radiation the Hiroshima bomb released. That's every single hour, hour after hour...\"\n\n-Chernobyl series\n\nChernobyl released 400 times the amount of radioactive material released by the Hiroshima bomb. Plus, the Hiroshima bomb released its radiation in an instant, in an airburst explosion, with alot of material going unto the upper atmosphere in the mushroom cloud and being dispersed over a very large area. When Little Boy exploded, it released about 2 pounds of fission products and 140 pounds of U235.\n\nChernobyl was constantly burning exposed for days. It released radioactive material in smoke and ash that settled and accumulated in the environment nearby and downwind. There were over 100 tons of uranium in the core when it exploded, along with all the fission products accumulated in the core during its life, and all the fission products it created as it continued to burn after the explosion. The fission products are actually more harmful than the actual uranium.",
            "I understand that this has been mostly answered but there's a key detail missing from all of the top voted answers. The goal of the bombs dropped in Japan was to create a big explosion and radiation was a byproduct. In a nuclear reactor, radiation is the goal in order to boil more water. Because the latter focused on creating as much radiation as possible, a breach has longer lasting impacts. The former had a goal of creating as big of an explosion as possible, not salting the earth.",
            "The Hiroshima bomb had exactly 62 kg of fissile (radioactive) material that was dispersed across a large area and much was converted to energy. There were thousands of  kilograms of radiative material in Chernobyl.",
            "Bombs are one and done. Reactors are a gift that keep on giving.",
            "The short version is that nukes are designed to explode and reactors aren't.\n\nThe elaboration on that is that there's two major differences between a weapon and a reactor from this perspective: the amount of fissile material (basically the stuff that does the fission, so uranium) dispersed and the amount of fissile material to start with.\n\nThe first thing is important because of what you're trying to do with the bombs vs reactors. With a bomb, you want to release all the energy locked up inside that uranium as fast as humanly possible. In practice, that means you're trying to react as many atoms of uranium as you possibly can as quickly as you possibly can. When you do that, most of that uranium splits into smaller atoms, which rapidly decay into weird stuff like ^(90)Sr, all of which has pretty short half-lives (less than 30 years in the case of ^(90)Sr). That is to say, nuclear weapons turn pretty much all of their uranium into much shorter-lived radioactive isotopes when they detonate, because turning all your uranium into other, lighter stuff is basically the whole point of a nuclear reaction. The practical upshot of this is that, in addition to the force of the explosion yeeting all this stuff pretty far away (meaning much thinner and easily dispersed contamination), the contamination itself is going to decay fairly quickly. \n\nNow, Chornobyl, on the other hand, is kind of the opposite of a nuclear bomb. In a reactor, you want the reaction to happen as slowly as possible, so that it simmers nicely instead of exploding. But, when Chornobyl had its overpressure, it shot a bunch of that reactor gunk out into the environment, which has much longer half-lives.\n\nThe second thing is just the amount of material involved. Little Boy only had 64 kilos of uranium. By comparison, Chornobyl had a veritable mountain of the stuff sitting inside it.",

            "In a bomb, the idea is to use up all the fissile material (or as much as you can) to deliver a single large burst of energy. So the radioactive material gets used up. \n\nIn a reactor, the fissile material is very slowly reacting to heat up water. If your just let all the radiation into the environment it will stay radioactive much longer as you aren\u2019t using up that material.",
            "The difference between a nuclear explosion and a melted nuclear core. The atomic bomb has a relatively small amount of nuclear material which detonated and was spent. That releases an immense amount of radiation in one big blast. So you absorbed an immense amount of radiation if you were in the blast radius. But there wasn\u2019t any remaining fuel after the explosion so there was nothing to continuously emit radiation. Chernobyl on the other hand is a massive damaged core full of nuclear materials that are slowly burning and emitting radiation.",

            "One major component is the amount of fuel.

Every hour the Reactor was exposed it was like 3-5 bombs worth of radiation. \n\nHour after hour day after day.\n\nSo basically a one time dose of comparatively low radiation vs a steady dose of 3-5 times the radiation for weeks to irradiate everything.",
            "Two reasons, first the atomic bombs have much less radioactive material than Chernobyl. Just enough for a critical mass around 50kg vs the 50,000 kg of fuel in the reactor and all the radioactive graphite. It\u2019s the difference between spilling a cup and spilling something about the size of a hot tub swimming pool if you count the graphite. Then the blast from the bombs spread radiation around and converted much of the uranium to short lived isotopes. So it was able to dissipate quickly. Chernobyl not so much. There are still large amounts of fuel and other radioactive materials in the area that will be a danger for the foreseeable future.",
            "This is a very good question but unfortunately has a long answer. \n\nFirst there were different types of bomb dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and they are very different from a reactor hydrogen/oxygen explosion that happened at Chernobyl. The bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima was a 80% uranium 235 and 20% uranium 238 and used the shotgun detonation method. The bomb that was dropped on Nagasaki was manly plutonium 239 with some other shorter lived plutonium isotopes like 240 and 241, and this bomb used the implosion method.\n\nChernobyl was using low enriched uranium about 30% 235 and 70% 238 to produce power and to produce plutonium 239 for nuclear weapons. When the reactor overheated it split the water in the reactor into hydrogen and oxygen, when the oxygen hydrogen mixture rose to the top of the reactor it recombined into a chemical explosion that blew the lid off the reactor then separately blew the roof off the reactor building. Chernobyl was a chemical explosion not a nuclear explosion.  Because Chernobyl used graphite to moderate the neutrons in the reactor this chemical explosion left a fissioning nuclear reactor open to the world with no water to take the heat away. As happens any time you have a very hot object it heats the air around it up and hot air rises and is replaced with colder air from the surrounding atmosphere. This current of air sucked up any of the dust in the reactor and pushed it high into the atmosphere taking with it highly radioactive elements. \n\nThe biggest difference between Chernobyl and the bomb that were dropped on Japan was the quantity of radiation that it was emitting. Chernobyl was emitting twice the total amount of gamma radiation of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima every single hour that it is exposed to the open air. It was also releasing a large quantity of isotopes that are alpha emitters that are harmless on your skin but extremely deadly if ingested, or inhaled. Around Chernobyl you see a lot of young dogs but no old dogs. They die from ingesting alpha particle emitters. This is one of the biggest reasons why the area around Chernobyl is uninhabitable. \n\nThe biggest challenge with nuclear energy is that most people don\u2019t understand what it is or how it works or how it is measured. I can pick up a rock and hold it next to my receiver and say this rock it emitting 3 milli sieverts per hour. Because most people have no idea how much 3 milli sieverts per hour is they will go off my reaction so I can very easily make it seem like this is the end of the world or nothing to worry about just by expressing emotion. This leads to a lot of confusion and anxiety regarding nuclear energy and an invisible buggy man who might be right under your feet. But remember this, even if you take the worst numbers of people who died from Chernobyl it is still less that the number of people who die each year from coal. \n\nSorry for any typos as I am writing this on my phone.",

            "Not all nuclear power is the same. \n\nThe short answer is atomic bombs are designed for air bursts, and designed to use up their nuclear payload in the form of an explosion. That means minimal ground contamination, and most of the cancer-causing radioactive particles are  spread out and decay quickly. Right now the radiation levels there are normal compared to background radiation. The bombs in Japan also had less than 100kg of nuclear material combined. \n\nIn Chernobyl you something like 150 TONS of nuclear fuel that blew up highly radioactive graphite and other materials all over a huge area in an uncontrolled explosion.

Also there is a huge pool of radioactive material still in chernobyl (elephants foot) that had to be painstakingly sealed with concrete; there were fears initially that this radioactive material would literally eat through the ground until it got to groundwater where it would trigger a massive explosion that would have killed hundreds of millions and left a huge uninhabitable crater in Ukraine in Belarus.

            "After going to Hiroshima in the 90s I was curious about how it was thriving. The reason is, just after the detonation Hiroshima was hit by a typhoon.

It's why it's fine to walk though most areas of chernobyl, because the air and top soil have had most of their radiation pulled away by the wind. Another way to think of it is like it's heat. If you Blast a cold pie with a blowtorch for 2 seconds it will be moments before the whole pie is cold again. If you bake a pie and heat the whole thing up, the surface will cool in only a few minuets but it may be upwards of an hour before the whole pie is cold again.",

If the bombs had exploded on the ground, a lot of dirt and debris would have absorbed the radiation and still be emitting it today. On top of that, a nuclear bomb releases all its energy at once. After the initial blast, no additional radiation is being added to the system.\n\nBy contrast, a nuclear reactor releases energy continuously over time. Chernobyl may have been shut down, but since the explosion occurred on the ground, many materials that were inside of or otherwise in close proximity to the reactor were thrown up and out, and the fire carried radioactive particles many miles across Eastern Europe. Most of the fallout fell around Pripyat, which is why the area is abandoned.\n\nContrary to popular belief, Pripyat isn\u2019t a radioactive badland like it\u2019s often portrayed as, the town is still there and it\u2019s largely intact, it\u2019s just been abandoned for ~40 years. Even directly outside the New Safe Confinement structure that was slid into place around Chernobyl, radiation levels aren\u2019t that much higher than background. You can even visit Pripyat, but you need a special pass to enter the zone.",

            "You are not ignorant, it is a complex topic!  And you are asking, which makes you doubly not ignorant.\n\nThe simplest way to think of it is by comparing total energy involved in each incident.  We can use tons of TNT equivalent to measure energy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHiroshima bomb:  15 ktons TNT\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNagasaki bomb:  25 ktons TNT\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1 gram ^(235)U normal reactor fission:  19 tons TNT\n\nper Chernobyl fuel assembly (\\~5kg ^(235)U / assembly):  100 ktons TNT\n\nper Chernobyl reactor (\\~1500 fuel assemblies):  150 megatons TNT\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow these are very, *very* rough estimates.  And the fuel types and decay modes aren't exactly the same between a bomb and a reactor.  But hopefully the estimates serve to demonstrate the comparative scale of magnitude.  The amount of hard radiation lingering around in the form of fallout from each event is going to be proportional to its total energy.\n\nSo there was roughly 5 000 times as much energy available in the Chernobyl #4 reactor core as there was in the bomb at Nagasaki.  And 10 000 times as much as at Hiroshima.  The Chernobyl explosion and subsequent fire blasted a decent proportion of that radioactive material into the sky, and scattered it all over the place.  Over a huge area.  Over the course of many days.\n\nImagine if instead of once, Hiroshima had been bombed *every minute for a week*.  Every minute, of every hour, of every day.  For 7 days straight.  10 000 \"Little Boy\" bombs dropped on one spot.\n\nI would guess that a large part of Honshu would be uninhabitable to this day, after such a devastating event.\n\nThat's what the Chernobyl explosion represented.  More or less.",

            "Hiroshima/Nagasaki were detonated while still in the air. This allows most of the radiation to spread into the atmosphere (thinner fallout dispersed over a larger area) instead of binding to dirt, dust, and debris. The highest doses were estimated between 6-25 roentgens and 30-110 respectively. \n\nChernobyl's explosion exposed the core of the and proceeded to dump radiation into the air and environment for 10 days. It's estimated it radiated 10,000 roentgens per hour.",

            "In short:\n\nNuclear weapons are designed to release as much energy as fast as possible. Not to mention a good deal of the radiation is carried into the upper atmosphere, where it's scattered and made mostly harmless.\n\nMeanwhile, nuclear reactors are designed to Release energy very slowly, meaning that if it melts down, the radiation remains MUCH longer.",

The bomb dropped on Hiroshima he 64 kilograms of uranium. \n\nI realize that this doesn\u2019t take into account any spent fuel or any of the other factors at either location.",
            "Chernobyl's long-term uninhabitability can be attributed primarily to the difference in the nature of the nuclear incidents at Chernobyl, Nagasaki, and Hiroshima. In the case of Chernobyl, a catastrophic reactor explosion led to the release of a substantial amount of radioactive materials, including highly radioactive isotopes like cesium-137 and strontium-90, which contaminated the surrounding area. These isotopes have long half-lives, on the order of decades to centuries, making the contaminated zone hazardous for thousands of years. In contrast, the atomic bombings of Nagasaki and Hiroshima primarily released relatively short-lived isotopes like iodine-131, which decayed quickly, allowing for relatively swift recovery and reconstruction. Additionally, the prompt evacuation and decontamination efforts in the Japanese cities played a crucial role in their recovery, whereas Chernobyl's reactor fire and subsequent releases were far more severe and uncontrolled. Consequently, while Chernobyl remains uninhabitable for millennia due to the persistence of highly radioactive materials, Nagasaki and Hiroshima were able to rebuild and thrive over time due to the relatively short-lived nature of the radioactive contaminants and effective cleanup efforts.",

            "The real answer is that the bombs exploded in the air as opposed to Chernobyl which leaked at the ground",
            "A nuclear detonation produces fallout. This is known. Most of the fallout is highly radioactive, which believe or not is a good thing for habitability later on, but a very bad thing for initial survival rates. The more radioactive something is, the less time it is radioactive. Radioactive decay is typically measured in \u201chalf lives.\u201d This is the amount of time it takes half of the element to become more stable elements that are not radioactive. Each atomic decay produces radiation, so the shorter the half life the more radioactive something is.\n\nA clean nuclear bomb, like the ones used in Japan, very efficiently detonate their fissile material leaving mostly bi products. Most of those are like iodine-131, with a half life of 8 days. Some of the gnarlier byproducts are like Cs-137, with a half-life that\u2019s still relatively short (30 years) but even then 100 years later your radioactivity from that Cs is around 1/10th of what it was right after the bomb.\n\nThose products are also spread like a fine dust. In many ways this is bad, but for a city it\u2019s good in some ways. You can \u201cclean\u201d the area by washing things and removing topsoil.\n\nChernobyl had a non-nuclear explosion inside a fission reactor. Most of what came out isn\u2019t super radioactive but there was a LOT of it. The half lives of most of those things in the hundreds or thousands of years. So while the area isn\u2019t crazy radioactive (you can literally go there and spend a couple days walking around, or even a few minutes looking at the melted down core itself), it is going to be slightly radioactive for millennia.\n\nThe danger of radiation is in \u201cabsorbed dose\u201d and its cumulative. So say you have a place that\u2019s 5000x as radioactive as Pripyat, like Hiroshima ground zero the day after. Say you absorb a lethal dose there after 1 hour. It would take you 208 days to absorb that much radioactivity in Pripyat. Now, your body will repair that damage so really it\u2019s more like a few years before you hit the point of no return.\n\nUnfortunately during this time the slow steady radiation damage is going to cause you to develop all manner of cancers and other health problems. Your body itself will gradually become radioactive as the radiation makes elements in your molecular structure unstable.\n\nSo while the area won\u2019t kill you to visit, or even to stay for awhile, living there is going to at best dramatically shorten your lifespan.\n\nMeanwhile over at Hiroshima, because all that early radioactivity has decayed the background level of radiation is barely above normal.",

As Kyle Hill describes it, they're best against \"soft\" targets.\n\nSurface and subsurface bursts can destroy, again as Kyle Hill put it, \"hard\" targets and create massive amounts of fallout\n\nFallout comes from the amount of debris that is caught in the immediate blast, allowing nuclear material to \"attach\" to a physical object and linger in the environment instead of dispersing in the atmosphere.\n\nHiroshima and Nagasaki both suffered air bursts, meaning that the radiation recieved immediately was high but there was very little lingering fallout that would stay and emit further radiation.\n\nMeanwhile Chernobyl exploded and then burned over a much longer period of time (days as opposed to near instantaneously) meaning that it created massive amounts of fallout and dispersed it all over the surrounding area. There was also much more nuclear material present as well.",

            "And basically comes down to one factor, The purpose of the tool doing the destruction ( tool is in fact doing a lot of heavy lifting here) in a bomb any energy released as alpha, beta, or gamma radiation is wasted energy that could be going towards making the explosion bigger so you want to reduce the amount of radiation leaked from your explosion as possible. While on the other hand a nuclear power plant is not meant to make an explosion at all it's meant to expose as much water as feasible to nuclear radiation so when something goes wrong Ie an explosion all of that radiation gets blasted everywhere.\n\nAs for why the regions were uninhabitable for different lengths of time A lot of it has to do with the end product. A bomb detonating is something working as intended. A nuclear power plant detonating is something experiencing a malfunction. When those nuclear fuel rods be they uranium or plutonium get vaporized the fission byproducts and nuclear fuel are often too heavy to be carried very far on the wind and rain. A large chunk of the harmful material landed in the nearby area and not only are uranium and plutonium just toxic to be around they're also toxic to have in your body in other ways besides just being radioactive. Plutonium for instance humans have no natural defense against the toxicity of plutonium It's not naturally found in our environment because it decays too quickly for us to have evolved around it.",

Because of the dangers of the nuclear material constantly releasing tons of unshielded radiation, it is much more dangerous. An explosion will release tons of this material into the environment and the material takes thousands of years to decay. If the damage and release is significant, like at Chernobyl, cleanup is economically unfeasible and so it is left alone.",
            "Nuclear weapons are designed to convert as much of their fissile material to energy as possible. A majority of the fallout comes from neutron capture of soil and debris, but this has a pretty short half life (weeks rather than years). In a perfect detonation, very little radioactive material remains, it's all used up and converted to lighter elements and energy.\n\nNuclear plants are designed to house a huge quantity of fissile material, that in the case of Chernobyl, didn't explode in a 'nuclear bomb' sense by sudden intense fission, but by extreme pressure from steam and ignition of hydrogen. This dispersed actual radioactive material over a relatively small area. Some of the isotopes have really, really long half lives which makes them harmful long after the initial event that dispersed them.",

As a result, you get billowing black cancer smoke. \n\nA nuclear bomb is designed to convert radioactive material into energy. The better it does that, the lass radiative material is left.\n\nChernobyl was a disaster. When it melted down and exploded, none of that process was planned or designed to efficiently convert the radioactive fuel into energy. Because of this, the explosion was nowhere near as powerful as a nuclear bomb, and the vast majority of nuclear material was unconverted.

Converting as much energy or radiation into explosive potential is a design goal.\n\nA power plants goal is to release power slowly for a long time.  Refueling is pretty involved with radioactive materials.  The goal here is to have as much energy in as cheap a container as possible.

            "A nuclear weapon is a compact heavily enriched amount of uranium or plutonium.  The goal of a nuclear weapon is to convert as much material into energy in an instant.  It does this by slamming the material together tightly so the natural decay of one atom releases particles that cause another atom to decay.  Causing a chain reaction and releasing a lot of energy quickly.\n\nA nuclear reactor is the opposite in many ways.  It's goal is to slowly convert a large amount of minimally enriched uranium into energy.  The concentration of material is not as dense, but there is a lot more nuclear material overall.  An atom that naturally decays still causes a chain reaction, but it's more like fire than an explosion.  Control rods are used to absorb some of the particles and damping the chain reaction in much the same way you control a fire by limiting air.\n\nNagasaki and Hiroshima had a relative small amount of highly enriched material detonated in the air.  This produced intense heat and gamma radiation.  Gamma radiation is bad really bad, but it doesn't stick around.  The remaining materials and radioactive by products were spread over a massive distance.\n\nIn the case of Chernobyl there was no explosion like a nuclear bomb when they messed with their control rods.  There simply wasn't enough tightly packed enriched material to do that.  Instead what happened was an uncontrolled chain reaction, like a uncontrolled fire, that produced so much heat it damaged the reactor, caused an overload of steam, and radioactive material spewed every where.  Radioactive byproducts like iodine, cesium and strontium isotopes with short, but not extremely short half lives were released.  (Radiation is produced when atoms decay so the shorter the half life the more radiation and less time it lasts.) The radioactive iodine is mostly gone as it had an 8 day half life, but caesium-137 and Strontium-90 have a \\~30 year half life. Uranium-235 used for bombs and reactors has a half life of \\~700 million years which produces much less radiation, although it's also rather toxic.\n\nAll of this said the wider area around the reactor is not uninhabitable, although the reactor itself and the immediate area around it is still very dangerous.   The 100 square mile Exclusion Zone in fact boasts an extremely abundant population of plants and animal.  Including deer and wolves.   It's fairly safe to visit the zone as long as you stay out of certain areas, and it's become a tourist destination of sorts.  People could live in the area with an increased risk of cancer and birth defects.  It's not a good place to live, but you could.  Given the area is contaminated with radioactive and toxic elements I wouldn't bet on anyone living to a ripe old age.",
            "A couple things came into play with the nuclear bombings of Japan.  \n\nNumber 1, the bombs were airbursts.  Thus, the majority of radioactive materials vaporized during the detonation of the bombs was swept up into the upper atmosphere in the mushroom cloud and rapidly reduced in concentration to negligible levels over the following week.  The same is true of the dust and debris from the detonation.  Chernobyl on the other hand was an explosion which threw up a substantial amount of material into the air which then was mixed with radioactive materials from inside the reactor itself.\n\nNumber 2, as has been stated, the radiation pulse from the detonation was intense, yes, but very short in contrast to the environment within Chernobyl's reactor.  The intense neutron flux and extensive exposure of numerous elements to that flux created a number of dangerous isotopes which are products of uranium fission like Cesium-137, Iodine-131, and Strontium-90 (as referenced in the TV show).  These isotopes were also present in Hiroshima and Nagasaki following the blasts, but because there was so little fissioned material, there wasn't enough of these isotopes present in the fallout to remain dangerous for more than a few weeks.  Contrast that to Chernobyl where substantial quantities were released.  \n\nNumber 3, the weather following the blasts in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  It actually rained following the blasts and washed away much of the fallout in the ensuing days which effectively decontaminated the two cities.  Chernobyl could not benefit from rain because the source of fallout and radiation did not dissipate following the explosion.  In fact, water in the core acted to increase the chain reaction in the core rather than dissipate it, spiking radiation levels.",
            "Japanese bombs were detonated above land. The Earth moved through time and geometric space since that point in time. Radiation dissipated quicker because of where it was. (Imagine the Earth passing an explosion several miles in space; the Earth would only get a small amount of radiation as it passes by).\n\nChernobyl leaked huge quantities of radioactive material on Earth and is still half-lifing into the soil.

My grain of salt with a little detail:\n\nThere was no nuclear explosion in chernobyl, there was an _explosion_ yes, an explosion that spreaded fissile material to the sorroundings, in the form of radioactive ash and debris.\n\nOn the other hand a nuclear explosion happens when fissile material (like uranium 235) undergoes a fission reaction and releases a _shit ton of energy_. After the explosion there's a fallout, because the fission reaction generates Krypton-92 and Barium-141, which are both radioactive, but they decay in a couple of days.\n\nSo yeah, that's a nuclear bomb and a dirty bomb in a nutshell, one reaction releases mainly energy, the other just spreads poison to the surrounding areas.",

It also makes the radioactivity dissipate faster. Chernobyl is constantly emitting radiation, which contaminates everything around the reactor.",
            "The whole point of a good nuclear bomb is to release the most amount of energy in the shortest amount of time. This means more of the fissile material gets consumed in the initial burn.

Chernobyl was basically a nuclear fire, constantly spewing radioactive matter into the air.\n\nI highly recommend Kyle Hill on YouTube. He has a magical series on everything nuclear disaster related that hits the sweet spot of both captivating and educational.",
            "Adding to the comments here: another reason was the amount of radioactive material: the Chernobyl nuclear plant's reactors contained numerous tons of nuclear fuel. The bomb dropped on Hiroshima, by comparison, only contained about 141 pounds of nuclear material. Also, the nuclear explosions themselves were very different: the chain reaction from the atomic bombs likely caused the nuclear material to change forms of matter in the process of the explosion. While Chernobyl did, indeed, have a nuclear explosion, and any remnants that fell were likely magnitudes smaller than the original mass of material. Conversely, much of the Chernobyl explosion was akin to a \"dirty bomb\" with tons of unexploded, radioactive materials scattered everywhere (even into Western Europe) by the rest of the explosion.",
            "The atomic bombs contained 100 radioactive \u201cbullets\u201d and quite a bit of TNT (for the sake of example). The TNT wasn\u2019t radioactive and the bullets were dispersed so far so fast that they hardly posed a threat to people beyond the initial few years. \n\nChernobyl had billions of bullets and those bullets will keep firing inside of the reactor (which is sealed) for thousands of years until they run out of fuel.",
            "Barring the other things already discussed also the fact rhe bombs were detonated before they hit the ground giving more room for dispersion as its got 360 degrees to travel,\n\nIf the bomb hit the ground the fissionable material would have had much less room to travel and would probably have caused radioactive hotspots around both bomb sites",

And that's what it all comes down to I believe is how much radioactive energy was produced. Like the bomb Little Boy had 64kg of uranium in it but only 1.09kg became energy. Chernobyl had approximately 1,900kg of uranium and about 570kg of that was turned into energy and released into the air affecting everything within a much higher and dangerous area. The exclusion zone is roughly 1,017 square miles. Chernobyl could've been even worse had it not been stopped when it did. It could've affected a good portion of Europe. If I'm wrong about anything I did most of this research on the fly. Please correct me if something is wrong, but this is roughly what I gathered.\n\nEdit: I completely forgot to mention the 760kg of plutonium as well.",

            "A bomb is a small amount of nuclear material going boom, really sucks for awhile but it clears up relatively fast,  a reactor meltdown is alot of nuclear material, releasing smoke and contaminating everything around it, it tends to be much more potent radiation, and can be carried by stuff like water and wind for as far as it'll go as a particulate. Imagine dirt sand and dust that wants to kill you, thats what a poorly contained meltdown looks like, and why after Fukushima they removed alot of surface dirt from the surrounding area, because otherwise it would've just stayed radioactive.",

They have bounced back big time.  It isn't uninhabitable to them.\n\nFinally no one **knows** how long things will be bad, because we have never been through this before.  There are too many variables we have little to no experience with. But the people still living there and the thriving wildlife are great indicators that this 20,000 year number has been greatly exaggerated (not that we'll see normalcy in this lifetime).",

Not in a week, not in a month, it will burn and spread its poison until the entire continent is dead!\u201d (Chernobyl)\n\nThere was a LOT more radiation in Chernobyl.",
            "This video explains it very well. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/e3RRycSmd5A?si=HiZ55PefqmQlYi3C",
            "Each of the bombs dropped on Japan had 64 kilograms of uranium in them. Of that 64 kilograms, approximately 2% (1.28 kg) actually underwent fission during the explosion.\n\nOn the other hand, the reactor at Chernobyl had 192 metric tons (192,000 kg) of uranium in the reactor when it went critical. And it ALL went critical. That's 3,000 times more than was in either of the bombs dropped on Japan and 150,000 times more uranium than what went critical in either of the bombs.\n\nFurthermore, the nuclear part of the explosions in Japan were over in just a fraction of a second. Chernobyl's nuclear pile is still cooking and sending off radiation.",
            "Nagasaki and Hiroshima were both air burst detonations, radiation released had nothing to attach to but air so it decayed and went away.\n\nGround bursts allow the radiation to interact with dust, building material, etc.  Chernobyl explosion was kicking up a massive plume of material that spread all over.",
            "Think of a bomb as setting of a firecracker in your house.\n\nThink of a reactor as burning a campfire in your house. \n\nChernobyl was a bonfire that was left to eternally burn the coals.",
            "The bombs in Japan detonation in the air, not on the ground. So the ground was not badly contaminated.",
            "Alright, listen up. Chernobyl and the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are apples and oranges. Chernobyl was a catastrophic nuclear reactor meltdown, releasing a ton of radioactive materials into the environment. It's like comparing a wildfire to a backyard BBQ gone wrong.\r  \n\r  \nHiroshima and Nagasaki, on the other hand, were nuclear bombings that caused immediate destruction, but the radioactive fallout was relatively limited. Plus, they were bombed once, not like Chernobyl, which kept spewing radioactive material.\r  \n\r  \nSo, it's not about the mere presence of nuclear stuff; it's about how much, how it's released, and what kind of nuclear event we're talking about. Chernobyl's got a multi-millennium problem because it unleashed an epic radioactive mess, while Hiroshima and Nagasaki were horrific, but their aftermath wasn't radiologically apocalyptic. Clear as radioactive mud now?",
            "It\u2019s interesting to know that you can walk right up to the Chernobyl plant without radiation gear and be relatively fine (or, you could if you were allowed to do that. Still a bad idea, though). The plant is however still producing radiation that is in shielded. The stuff that got dropped on Japan is long gone, so it isn\u2019t contaminating the area anymore. It\u2019s only slightly higher ambient radiation at the impact site than normal.\n\nIt would be better to compare Chernobyl to Fukushima and see why one can reopen and one won\u2019t. Fukushima was larger than Chernobyl and it\u2019s Leah was initially just as bad. However, the authorities at Chernobyl not only stripped safety measures away, but they also ignored the damage until it was too late to do any kind of mitigation. At Fukushima, they shut the plant down at the first sign of a leak, and several heroic workers stayed behind, effectively sacrificing themselves, to keep the core cooled so it wouldn\u2019t blow. The radiation was contained and they avoided a total meltdown like Chernobyl, so even though MORE radiation was let out, we were able to dissipate it safely, where Chernobyl kind of just went everywhere and so is now stuck.",
            "Basic difference was that Chernobyl incident happened on ground level, scorching and contaminating the surrounding lands completely. It was a nuclear reactor.\n\nThe bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were aimed to cause destruction and both bombs were detonated several hundreds of feet above the ground. Result: Significant less land contamination but a wider radius of hellfire, death and destruction..\n\nChernobyl had several hundred times worth of fissile material.",
            "Jesus Christ some people really can't put 2 and 2 together huh?",
            "Radioactive fallout from a bomb is mainly two parts: normal stuff that got sucked up by the blast and picked up an extra neutron or two, and unburned nuclear material from the bomb.  Most of the neutron activated stuff is really unstable, and decays into something harmless fairly quickly.  The contamination from bomb residue sticks around for a lot longer, and is mainly heavy metals that are really toxic along with the radioactive part.  The sad thing is that radiation and fallout weren't really understood then, so people went back to live in those cities.  As the residue worked its way into the food chain, it got absorbed by the people.  While concentrations were likely too low to kill, there was a lot of health issues.  Today both cities are fully rebuilt.  Got to visit Nagasaki myself, and is quite worth visiting.",
            "The difference is: Godzilla",
            "In a bomb what goes bang is the fissile material. In a nuclear meltdown what goes bang is the water.\n\nThis proves that water is more dangerous than uranium."

            "If you want a serious answer, the book 'Mere Christianity' by C.S. Lewis is a fascinating read. Lewis was, somewhat famously, a hardcore atheist who came to believe in God later in life. There are some things in the book I don't buy. His theory about homosexuality and sexual perversion are too much of a stretch and outdated. I also remember a bit about why men are the final decision-makers in a marriage that was ridiculous.  Regardless, the book is largely an attempt  to logically breakdown and answer your question and I recommend it.",

            "I was raised without religion being a big part of my life. My husband was raised Christian and still considers himself a Christian. I asked him one day, during a discussion about my own doubts in religion and what I believed, HOW he could possibly believe in something so abstract. He's a computer scientist, he deals in facts and science and it seems like the Christian beliefs would go against that. \nHe explained to me that he spent a long time researching and discovering other religions. When it came down to it the evidence that was presented in Christianity was enough to suffice for him. He also stated that even if he had his doubts, he knows that following Christianity can't HURT himself or others. He is following a religion that literally encourages him to be the best he can be and help others. (Him and his family do Christianity the right way, I should add.) He said, at the end of this life if there's a chance that there's a God and Heaven he's happy to know that he's done all he can to ensure he gets saved and hopes to see the same for his friends and family. \nNo one has ever explained this in a way that made SO much sense to me. After that conversation I've gone on to do my own research and even attended church for the first time. I'm still unsure in my beliefs but I'm certainly much more open than I've ever been, and far more understanding of what Christianity SHOULD look like, as opposed to what I thought it was based on some people in my life who have used religion as an excuse to do terrible things. \n\nEDIT Because this blew up way more than I intended it to. \nObviously I didn't word this quite right because how could I when I'm just interpreting my husband's very simple ways of explaining to me, who has always struggled with her own faith. This was a super quick summary of a three hour long conversation we had. I'm not replying to you each individually so let me answer a few questions. \nYes, he believes in God. He has his own reasons for that on top of the \"evidence\" he believes in as well.\nI should have used a better phrase than \"the evidence is enough to suffice for him\" my point was that as a scientific thinker , he appreciates the physical evidence put in front of him to support his beliefs. \nYes, the Bible says some crappy things. He knows that, we all know that. I could go on and on about this but I won't. I'll sum it up with : stories change when passed on , times change as well. \nBut in summary the absolute most important part of this is that in believing in Christianity, in God, in Jesus he does no harm. He does not judge others for how they live their lives, or what religions they follow despite living many years being ridiculed or judged for his own religion. He does not force his religion on anyone, but is supportive and helpful in helping me to understand where he's coming from and through my own struggle in faith. He has something I wish I had... A sense of peace with what comes after all this. ",
            "People inherently want to believe. They want the comfort of faith to fall back on. They want hope.\n\nFor the night is dark and full of terrors.",
            "I don\u2019t know if this is the answer you are looking for,or if it even answers the question,but as someone who is a Christian and believes in God, having faith in God isn\u2019t as easy as people sometimes make it out to be. I say that to mean, just cause someone believes in God doesn\u2019t mean that they don\u2019t have things that challenge their beliefs on the regular. And that\u2019s coming from both outside and inside sources,meaning when someone or something challenges what you believe and when you yourself challenge your own beliefs to get to the bottom of theological issues as well as just philosophical. I am 23 and in college about to graduate, but I took an Intro to Christian Theology class 3 years ago,and one of the books/topics we always talked about was the idea of Faith Seeking Understanding. What this means is that having faith in God will lead you to ask those burning questions and get to the bottom of them, not to disprove Gods existence,but to make sense of this crazy world around us that He\u2019s created. So hopefully that kinda shed some light on your question from someone who believes in God. I\u2019d be happy to answer any other questions you may have or if you just wanna talk. Definitely a good question,and not stupid by any means :)\n\nEdit: One last thing I thought of. Faith doesn't replace understanding, it works along side it.\n\nEdit #2: so a lot of people have been asking me questions which is super cool,glad you guys are wanting to discuss! Just wanted to say I\u2019m gonna try and respond to as many as I can,but if I don\u2019t or if it\u2019s not til later I apologize! I am about to go out for my moms birthday. \n\nEdit #3: just wanted to say thanks to all the people who have commented with questions and their view points. It\u2019s been really fun to talk to everyone and see different peoples views. I hope that my answers have been respectable and considerate. The last thing I have been trying to do is get anyone to change their position or beliefs. Just wanted to answer the questions as best as I could. :)",
            "It's hard to accept that death is the end and you just cease to exist. It's much easier to believe there is a god and you have a chance to live eternally. I think most opt for the chance of an afterlife. ",
            "Lack of evidence is not inherently a disqualifying factor for belief. Its worth acknowledging, and accounting for, but it doesn't actually disprove anything.\n\nHumans build their entire lives on things they can't provide proof for (at least anything that would stand up to scrutiny), we do it in our personal, professional, and even scientific lives. We do our best to find evidence for it, and sometimes we do, sometimes we don't, and sometimes we find evidence against it. But not finding evidence is not the same as finding evidence against something.\n\nSo frankly there is no reason to lose faith. I personally believe christians should acknowledge a lack of evidence, but that doesn't mean christians are wrong, its just means they haven't been proven right.  \n\n\nEDIT: a consistent theme in the comments: I am not trying to advocate that people believe in god. I am also not trying to say that people who don't believe in god are wrong. I'm saying you can't make a conclusive call on either side.  This logic applies both ways, and that is okay.",

Plus they take comfort in the eternal cosmic love of an all mighty being. \n\nIt is called faith because it doesn't require proof, just trust.",

            "As a scholar in the Old Testament, I have some insight. \n\nThe Jews repeatedly turned away from God in the bible, but it was never an instant thing. God shows up, everyone worships, then after 400 years or so they forget he actually showed up and turn away again. God shows up again and everyone worships. Then maybe 600 years go by and they turn away again.\n\nSo really a long absence from his last appearance is par for the course. Don't make the mistake of believing the bible details a rapid fire series of events. \n\nBut then also keep in mind that when the Jews turned away from God, not ALL of them turned away. So while the people of the world might walk away from religion, it likely will never be all of them. ",

            "Physical laws don't provide a complete explanation of the universe.  This leads us to the inevitable limits of human knowledge, and that some things are simply unknowable.   Stuff like, what existed before this Universe came into being, what sparked the spontaneous creation of this one.  Oh sure there are theories, multi-verses, quantum foam, strings, but many of these theories, outside of abstract equations,  have no direct evidence to support them.   So one can dismiss God or Gods from the equations, but that still leaves no resolution to the basic philosophical implications of meaning, purpose and origin.

            "I can't speak for everyone but I can speak for myself. I have faith in God because to me it makes sense, and it guides me. I've seen a lot of people on here saying that the only reason people believe in God is because they're otherwise to afraid of death or they feel hopelessly lost in our dark world, and while although that certainly speaks for why people may feel drawn to God's comforting spirit, in my opinion it transcends that. \n\nThe function of sin, for example, is something that has always made a staggering amount of sense to me. I'm not saying that every notion of sin makes sense, but rather, the idea that humanity is functionally flawed. There is historical proof of Jesus Christ living and dying, and for me the fact that for so long so many people have found guidance and validity in Christ is at least partial proof to the nonbeliever.\n\nFurthermore, I think it requires being in a sanctuary of people to truly understand why so many people adhere to Christianity. I'm not talking about human-stained mega churches, or anything like that, I'm talking about a humble and small group of different but universally bonded brothers and sisters reflecting in the human struggle, and the presence that our God gives to us - that cannot be explained in any other way than to experience it. \n\n&#x200B;",

Now of course when we repent good works should flow from us.  But Christians still admit we are deeply flawed and will remain so until we die.  You can certainly point out our issues.

I have studied the bible and many other religions only the bible explains many medical facts, thousands of years before discovery.

My mother is deeply religious and I felt not only an obligation to make her happy, but I felt safe in my church knowing my mom believed these things.

Blessed are those who believe without seeing.\n\nSo there's that. However, a real follower of Jesus struggles. Romans 7 is a great example of struggle with sin, but it's way more than that. I have doubts. Faith is challenged. There's nights when I'm afraid, even of eternity or of just the unknown of the future. And there's times that I'm mad at God and blame Him for many things, both in the details in my life and the macro problems of poverty, death, racism, cruelty, etc. These things I struggle with, but there is grace for me to struggle. I have space to be angry with God for a time. But I always come back, because faith draws me back and love draws me back.\n\nI understand why many do not believe and don't get how Christians can believe. But honestly, until you jump out beyond whatever you're using as evidence against Biblical Christianity in faith, there's just not going to be a way to understand.",
            "We're wired to think the things we're doing are worthwhile in some way. Otherwise, what's the point? If you don't believe in God or an afterlife though, you might start thinking about the worthiness of this whole thing and come up short for that point. \n\nAlright so I'm here to help others and make a positive difference. But all those people I help will all die some day. And any positive difference I make will be forgotten at some point, with no one still alive as a witness. The more you think things through like this, the less difference there seems to be between continuing on and doing things, and dying today. \n\nThat can't be so, right? But if we think there's some bigger plan that we don't know about, and a continuation of our lives afterward, it could give meaning to our ultimately pointless exercises here. \n\nIf you had men digging a ditch all day long and then covering it back up at the end of the day, and repeating this for years and generations, eventually those men (and their progeny) will begin to find a meaning behind it all, as certainly they wouldn't all be doing that for so long without some kind of plan.

            "I hope people read this answer because I have put a lot of thought into this for many years. This has nothing to do with any particular religion and you don\u2019t even need to be religious to understand this answer.\n\nAnyway this argument starts with Faith, and how everyone, whether they\u2019re religious or not has \u201cfaith\u201d in something. It is inescapable.\n\nFaith is necessary for almost anything that you believe in your every day life. Why do people believe in any event in history? Why do people believe in evolution? Why do people believe that there are planets or galaxies outside of what they can see with their home telescopes? Even if you were educated and intelligent enough to investigate one of these issues you couldn\u2019t \u201cprove\u201d that most of them happened without some evidence or information being reported to you by another person or source. Even if you could, you would have spent your entire life investigating one of these issues and still not even come close to an understanding of the world around you. The Catholic tradition therefore suggests that faith and reason *together* are necessary to understanding both God and the world.\n\nNow why do people believe in God? I could ask why people do not believe in God and neither of us can provide an objective answer. \n\nThere\u2019s a ton of arguments for why God exists but many of them are very long and complex. Thomas Aquinas wrote extensively on the subject. A non-religious argument I have always found to be interesting is that people rarely realize the practical philosophical implications of not having a God and how God not existing would mean that all morality would be subjective.\n\nIn other words, there is no way of differentiating between human beings who are \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d morally without a God figure. Because human beings are inherently \u201cequal\u201d our morality or sense of justice would simply be based on who among us could impose their will on the others around them. Thomas Hobbes was one of the first intellectuals to write on this \u201cstate of nature\u201d suggesting that life in this state to be \u201cnasty, brutish, and short\u201d\n\nIf Person A said that genocide of a particular group was \u201cgood\u201d Person B would have no objective way of disproving Person A without appealing to an objective authority above them. In other words, Person A\u2019s *opinion* , his subjective morality, is just as valid as Person B\u2019s.\n\nAnd do not get me wrong, I am not saying that morality is based on Person A being afraid to go to some burning hell, I am simply suggesting that the very idea of \u201cright and wrong\u201d cannot exist in a world where God is absent. Morality would simply be the \u201cwill of the majority\u201d.\n\nSo not only is there no reason *not* to believe in God, but God is necessary to have a healthy society with morality. Otherwise there\u2019s nothing to stop us from becoming nihilists and hedonists.",

As a person of faith you are encouraged to have a personal relationship with God. Talk to god in your internal monologue, and look for his light in all things.\n\nIt may sound like nothing but placebo, but there is solid evolutionary and social benefits to believing in god. \n\nThese days god, in the Catholic church specifically, is becoming more the personification of sharing common good with people. Despite what you hear on the news the vast majority of catholics (not sure about other sects) aren't strict dogmatic followers of the faith because that would mean...basically living in a commune.\n\nBelieving in God helps the people who believe. Its not just imagination, there are concrete physical benefits to being part of a community with a common goal and shared values.",

I know that sounds counterintuitive, but there are a lot of lessons to be learned from the Bible that don\u2019t require you to be a religious person.\n\nHopefully this statement makes sense, and I only bring it up because of the 2000 year point you made. You can believe in God without being religious. Like, I\u2019m a Catholic, but I can acknowledge that a lot of the \u201creligious rules\u201d are probably just things people made up. Like, for example, murder is bad, but not going to church and having sex with my fianc\u00e9 before we\u2019re married probably won\u2019t send me to hell. Basically if an idea existed before Christianity it means one thing, and if it existed after it means another thing. I\u2019m not sure how to phrase it. ",
            "From a Christian's perspective:\n\nIt's the starting point in thinking that makes all of the difference. Daniel Kahneman studied the effects of the availability bias. You can read more here: [https://fs.blog/2016/09/human-gulibility/](https://fs.blog/2016/09/human-gulibility/)\n\nWhy do I bring this up? Because this leads credence to the idea that if someone grows up believing in a deity, like YHWH to the Jews and Christians, and Allah to the Muslims, the idea of not believing in God is more likely to be bizarre and foreign to them. Likewise, if someone grows up without religious affiliation, the concept of believing in a deity may seem absurd. But the level of absurdity the individual observes seem to be directly correlated to availability bias.\n\nPut another way, you ask why people believe in God because you do not see evidence. Others may ask why you don't believe in God because you don't have evidence that he doesn't (Burden of proof gets pretty messy since both sides claim it's not in their court to prove).\n\nOn an individual basis, things get a lot muddier, as I'm sure there are a lot of contributing factors individuals aren't even aware of or don't acknowledge.\n\nMy personal anecdote: I've believed that God existed for as long as I could remember. I became a Christian shortly after moving in with my adoptive, loving Christian parents (age 13). I saw peoples lives transform and I've witnessed a medical miracle (shattered spine healed the next day. The radiologist thought the x-ray machine was broken and brought in another x-ray machine).

            ">He hasn't done anything for 2000 years...  \n>  \n>There's no real evidence....\n\nBeing a member of The Church of Jesus Christ (known by some as Mormons), we believe that He has always been doing things, and that there is in fact clear evidence found in the existences of both the Bible and the Book of Mormon, historical records of the interactions God has had with His children in different parts of the world. And then there's the first hand evidence. I've seen legitimate miracles, many of my family members have seen legitimate miracles. Things like miraculous curings, visions, angels, etc. have indeed occurred in my life and my family's life. That thing however, is that you need faith first, then the miracles come.\n\nIn the scriptures, God states that miracles cease when faith ceases. In short, you'll only see miracles if you already have faith. Some speculate that this is to mercifully avoid condemning those who see miracles but still don't want to believe. I mean, if you were a doctor and suddenly saw someone with confirmed cancer be immediately cured, what would you think? Would you think it was a miracle from God? Or would you try to explain it away by saying that maybe it wasn't actually cancer and your diagnostic tools were wrong, or perhaps it was cancer, it just wasn't as bad as you thought and some unknown factors in their body fixed it for them? Most people who don't believe in God would go with the latter.\n\nIn just the Bible alone, we see a frequent pattern of miracles occurring right in front of non-believers and those non-believers trying to explain it away as anything but a miracle from God. Many times they are even willing to acknowledge that it was supernatural, just so long as it wasn't from God, because if it was from God, then they would have to change their positions on morality (just as with Christ casting out the demons in a man, and some of the people at the time said it was because He was using the power of the devil).\n\nIn short, faith isn't really something you \"lose\", per se. It's actually something that you *choose*. Most people who don't believe in God don't believe in Him because they disagree with His moral system and don't want to abandon their own in favor of His. After that, they use excuses like \"there is no evidence\" and such, but in reality, they don't want to look for any because they just don't like God's position on how to live one's life.\n\nAnd that's the thing with trying to convince someone of the existence of God. You can't. Only they can.\n\n\\---\n\nAs for the whole \"why do bad things happen?\" question, the short answer is that this life is only a sliver of the whole plan and really mostly serves the purpose of teaching people what good and bad is by letting them see both good and bad. For most people, the real test will come afterward when it's much more clear to them what happened and they can still choose the path they want to take.\n\nFinal judgement doesn't come immediately after death as many Christians believe. That would be unfair to those who never got to know the gospel in this life. Final judgement is still a long way off, and a lot more needs to be revealed to everyone before then.",

After running around for a while it starts to sag down and I may have to retie it. One time my team conceded a free kick from a promising position and I went to take my place in the wall. This was about the 70 minute mark and I realised that my bun had sagged right down and was just about to come undone altogether, so I went to tie it up again and I thought \"hang on, I'll put the bun right on top of my head, it'll make me a couple of inches taller\" so I did. The ref saw me do this and he gave me a yellow card! I complained and some of my teammates joined in, he said it was \"unsportsmanlike conduct\" and if I didn't lower the bun and stop complaining I'd get a second yellow. I did and the dude hit the free kick miles over anyway. But yeah, I guess if you tried what you're asking, you'd get a similar result.

My parents immigrated from Africa, like a lot of fellow black people here.\n\nIn official forms, they wont say African Canadian neither.",
            "There are a lot of bad answers here.\n\nCanadians don't centre race in quite the same way as Americans. Like Americans will probably be used to having identified their race on thousands of forms, Canadians rarely do. When Canadians are asked about their background, we usually use the fuzzier term 'ethnicity' that has a lot more nuance to it.\n\n* Black people in Canada usually just use the term 'Black' with a capital B.\n\n* Occasionally you will see the term 'Black Canadian' which is usually only used if meant to distinguish *Canadian* Black people from other Black people, or sometimes in a political or historical context. Like you might hear someone say \"Lincoln Alexander was the first Black Canadian MP\" but you'd rarely hear a person call themself a \"Black Canadian\"\n\nThere is a lot of nuance to this:\n\n* Black Nova Scotians (sometimes called Afro-Nova Scotians) are a distinct group with a unique history - they are the descendants of escaped enslaved people from the US, many of whom fought for Britain in the war of 1812, and then subsequently they intermarried with local indigenous peoples\n\n* Because Canada didn't have a significant history of slavery (there were less than a thousand Black slaves in what's now Canada when slavery was abolished in 1833), most Black Canadians are immigrants from post-WWII or their descendants. (EDIT - the real divide is actually 1962, which is when Canada amended the Immigration Act to remove the legal restrictions on non-white immigrants, a white-supremacist policy that had been in place since 1911)\n\n* The largest groups are from Jamaica, Haiti, Nigeria, Ethiopia, France (via its colonies) and the US (i.e. African-Americans). As you can imagine, these groups have very different histories and cultures. This is VERY different than the US where 85% of the Black population are descended from people who were enslaved in the US, and from that experience, share a common cultural heritage.\n\n* Often these groups don't move to the same parts of Canada and don't speak the same language. E.g. Jamaicans speak English and 85% live in Ontario; Haitians speak French and 90% live in Quebec.\n\n* There is some sense of a collective identity among 'Afro-Caribbeans' i.e. Black people from the Caribbeans.",

            "Adding a persons geographic origins next to their nationality is an extension of America's deep culture of racism, connected to roots in racial segregation. While we all acknowledge that each of these groups (African America, Asian American, Mexican American, etc) are all designations of \"immigrating\" to the Americas....notice how White Americans are never referred to as European Americans, and how \"Native\" Americans are never referred to as plainly \"American\" but are distinguished by an unnecessary redundancy. Only White Americans get to be called \"American\" -- unless us non-Whites travel outside of the US, then we're just Americans...but in our own country our race always comes as a descriptor first. \n\nThis is because America has a cultural problem with race that sees White people as a centered norm, and all others as unequal deviations from that norm. The ONLY countries that decided to racially categorize its own citizens (native born to that country) are the countries that were colonized, displaced the natives of the land, and then brought in other people from other places and decided to call them \"other\".",
            "Speaking as an Australian, black people in Australia are called Australian. I'm not aware of any other country that segregates their citizens like Americans do. Specifying that members of your society are not part of your society makes Americans sound very much like Nazis to me. That combined with the American political system reinforces the Nazi vibe coming out of America. This will get downvoted by every yank that sees this, but it is the truth. America is deeply broken. You care more about a rotten piece of animal hide than actual lives and it disgusts every civilized country in the world.",

            "MLK liked Canada because we didn't have the same history of slavery and segregation and used us as a model for what he wanted in the US. He gave a bunch of lectures in 1967 shortly before he was killed.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/8B4aJcP-ZCY\n\n> \"The slums are the handiwork of a vicious system of the white society. Negros live in them, but they do not make them any more than a prisoner makes a prison\".\n\nHere in Canada, people are just Canadians. Call people by their names.\n\nMLK's main goal was to end segregation and get black people out of the slums. That never happened when he was alive. He was jaded about it but after he was murdered, the US public did genuinely try to integrate. He was a martyr for the cause.\n\nThe US isn't integrated because the establishment refuses to integrate. Malcolm X warned MLK this would happen but then he got murdered.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/T3PaqxblOx0\n\nHollywood exploits 'black' people. They've done so since vaudeville & minstrel shows.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/_tuu5YtkPIo\n\nThis stuff wasn't made because Americans were racist, it was made because left leaning Americans love black people as entertainment and Hollywood perpetually exploits it. The term African-American was forced on 'black' Americans in the early 90s as a way to impose ideological segregation in order to keep them in slums as socio-political entertainment. \n\nIn the 80s, the US was doing really well with integration until your racist media and academic industries broke their promise to MLK. Most of the race problems the US has now is because the US flipped from being colourblind and integrated as Americans to flipping to being PC tribal collectivists.\n\nWe were taught that labels like black or white are just made up social constructs rich people used to exploit poor people. They aren't real. People are individuals and everyone has their own different experiences.\n\nThe African-American label is ridiculously pro segregation. Jesse Jackson used the label while pandering to the Nation of Islam who are the group Malcolm X walked away from after he found out the founder knocked up a bunch of his teen followers. They're on the SPLC hate group list because they're black nationalists.\n\nYou Americans adopted a racist label 30 years after your country ended segregation then for the last 30 years, your media/prison/academic industries have been exploiting them.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/QHCSL-AKd3w\n\nPlease just be Americans again. I'm so tired of this stuff.",
            "No, because black people in Canada typically migrated there willingly, unlike the Africans who ended up in America against their will due to the slave trade.

            "there are so many comments here pointing out that \"durr canada is american too\" but that is missing the point entirely\n\nbecause \"african american\" is a *specific* term with a *specific* definition. it's not \"any person of african descent in any country in the americas.\" i sincerely doubt a jamaican person living in jamaica or ghanaian immigrant living in venezuela would ever call themselves that, for example. a jamaican or ghanaian immigrant to the usa would probably still not call themselves african american\n\nits a term specifically designed to refer to descendants of chattel slavery in america who, unlike the voluntary immigrants of american history, cannot trace their ancestry to any specific country. it means that your pre-american ancestry can be summed up as \"vaguely west african probably\". since the us is so obsessed with race and ethnicity due to its settlers being from other continents entirely, it eventually became imperative to have a word to describe us that wasnt just \"negro\" or worse. it allowed black people a way to connect to a heritage, the way italian americans or japanese americans can still tie their roots back to italy or japan even after generations of living in america\n\nthese days however that attitude is shifting. while it used to be the norm to describe descendants of chattel slavery in america, black people are instead beginning to feel like its an unnecessary moniker, because time and language changes. an american with german descent whose family hasnt been in germany in centuries is more likely to call themself just \"american\", not even \"german american\" or \"european american\", so why should \"african american\" still be the norm? we have no direct ties to africa. all it is is confusing people, clearly. just call us black",

Nigerian, Haitian). \n\nI\u2019m a Canadian, and I\u2019ve never heard the term African Canadian used. It would be akin to calling someone an Indian Canadian, or Mexican Canadian. To be a canadian, you don\u2019t need to give up your culture. It is fine to be a mexican in canada, and it is equally fine to identify as canadian, regardless of where you were born.",

In the UK we rarely classify by ethnicity (and we use that term instead of \"race\" because \"race\" is just icky) and it's usually voluntary and on a form to assess diversity. It's rare that it's a mandatory form because we just shouldn't (and the for the most part, don't) care what ethnicity someone is. We refer to black people as black people if we need to mention their ethnicity but more often it's just their name OR their nationality if they're not British. I have some neighbours who are from Ghana and Nigeria. They identify as Ghanaian and Nigerian but their kids were born here so would identify as British OR Black British but that's not something used in every day language at all. I've travelled a lot and no-one is as fixated on race and skin colour, and using that as a primary identifier anywhere as much as in the US. Not saying that there isn't racism anywhere else, because there is, but if the US just stopped focussing so much on the colour of someone's skin, then they might look past the surface and focus on inside.

Amazon has dedicated prayer rooms and dedicated policies for inclusivity including cultural sensitivity.\n\n\nI know people who have worked in places like Colorado  and people have worked in places like Wisconsin and Illinois. Every person has a different perspective of the company based on how their individual facility is managed. The people in Denver seem really happy with it and the people in Wisconsin seem really unhappy. The people in Denver say they have no issue going to the bathroom and getting accommodations while people in Wisconsin said Managers gave people grieve for going to the bathroom. \n\nOverall I think the company should contribute more to society.

            "They have created the kind of environment where they are often the cheapest and most convenient option...and in many places it is the only option for many products. I can go into some examples of this, but if you have ever seen the \"Amazon Essentials\" branding or tag you can be fairly sure that that product was originally sold by by a smaller company that amazon either bought outright, or undercut their prices and/or delisted them in their marketplace until they were driven out of business. So, what has happened is that now there are communities where amazon represents a kind of lifeline (that the post office fulfill(s/ed) in many rural communities). There is no longer an option. \n\nBut that is actually kind of the tip of the iceberg. Amazon is now much much more than just a storefront. Amazon is, in many ways, the internet. Amazon Web Services (AWS) hosts huge portions of the internet. Websites don't just exist in the ether. The \"cloud\" is really just a fancy word for \"a bunch of server racks somewhere\". Well, that \"somewhere\" is a warehouse and server racks owned and operated by Amazon. It is not as simple as \"dont just buy stuff from Amazon\". Do you know who hosts your websites? Chances are a lot of them are hosted by Amazon. Reddit, for instance, is hosted by AWS.\n\nFinally, if we were to focus on the ethics upstream of the goods and services we consume we would find out that we have no real options at all. The phrase \"no ethical consumption under capitalism\" can be a bit silly when bandied about in certain spaces....but it is kind of true. Most clothing being made and sold in stores you shop at is made in sweatshop conditions or under otherwise extremely exploitative and/or unsafe conditions. Our food is contaminated by deeply immoral practices both towards people and animals, as well as damaging of the environment. The electronics we use rely on conflict minerals like cobalt or politically fraught minerals like lithium, and again, extremely damaging of the environment. Many of us are currently experiencing the inequity of the housing market, well the housing market is almost entirely contaminated by deeply unethical practices that not only contribute to homelessness but necessitates it. In light of all of that, many of us do not have the kinds of choices that it looks like we might.",
