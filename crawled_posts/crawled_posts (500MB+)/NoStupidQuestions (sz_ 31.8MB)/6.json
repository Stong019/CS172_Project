This also impacts sight (candle meditation is a good example of this, besides the even better example that you provided).\n\nWe've come to evolve this way because the brain receives A LOT of sensory data all the time, which would overwhelm us if everything was brought to the forefront of our consciousness.

That would work too.\n\nEdit2: or give them this, from Bard;\n\nDividing by zero is undefined for a few key reasons:\r  \n\r  \n1. Lack of inverse:\r  \n\r  \nFor division to be meaningful, every number except zero must have a unique inverse. An inverse is a number that, when multiplied by the original number, results in 1. For example, the inverse of 5 is 1/5, because 5 \\* 1/5 = 1. However, no number can be multiplied by zero to get 1. Therefore, zero does not have an inverse, making division by zero undefined.\r  \n\r  \n2. Contradictions and inconsistencies:\r  \n\r  \nAllowing division by zero leads to logical contradictions and inconsistencies. For example, consider the equation x/0 = y. Multiplying both sides by 0 gives 0 = 0y. Since any number multiplied by 0 is 0, this equation essentially says that any number equals 0. This is clearly contradictory and meaningless.\r  \n\r  \n3. Limits and continuity:\r  \n\r  \nDividing by zero also creates problems when dealing with limits and continuity in mathematics. As a variable approaches zero, the expression 1/x becomes increasingly large and approaches positive or negative infinity depending on the direction of approach. This lack of a finite limit at x = 0 makes it impossible to define division by zero in a continuous and consistent manner.\r  \n\r  \n4. Real-world applications:\r  \n\r  \nIn real-world applications, such as physics and engineering, dividing by zero often leads to absurd or nonsensical results. For example, if we try to calculate the velocity of an object by dividing its displacement by zero time, we get an infinite velocity, which is physically impossible.\r  \n\r  \nIn conclusion, dividing by zero is undefined because it lacks a meaningful interpretation, leads to logical contradictions, and creates inconsistencies in various mathematical concepts and real-world applications.",

            "There's a theory that I'm sure I'm going to describe poorly, but I'm going to try. \n\nWhen you watch a movie with actors you're familiar with, you bring with you \"backstory\" that isn't actually part of the movie you're watching. \n\nThis theory ( if it has a name I don't remember it, ironic I know) proposes that you may actually be processing more information unconsciously. That would mean for example actors that have been type cast, can give an entirely different movie experience to viewers that are familiar with them. \n\nIt doesn't have to be type casting either. Your mention of the word archetype rang a bell. I'm commenting on the hopes that my comment will jog another redditors memory.",

I can also remember the names of all of the actors/voice actors for my favorite franchises very easily. \n\nI\u2019m less good with real names, but I\u2019m alright with them. I feel like this isn\u2019t a common thing though. \n\n\n\nI can\u2019t remember the names of anyone from Avatar though.",

            "I don't know your age, but I'm 43 now.  Watching movies or TV series are more of a mindless escape from everyday chaos, world events, impeachment bullshit, environmental concerns, bill paying, kid raising, work stress, family sickness, girlfriend finding, how am I gonna afford this, and so on...  the brain and body and self well being become overwhelmed.  Entertainment is just that, entertainment.  Too much real life to be overly concerned about not real life.  As a kid, I remembered everything also.  A lot less to deal with then though.  You're not alone on this carnival cruise ship bound to stall or crash.  Life gets in the way of living.",

            "This is why it's important for characters to look different and be costumed differently.  If the main cast are six white 30-something dudes with dark hair, I have no chance.  Heck, if there's _two_ people in a movie who look roughly similar I think I have a worse-than-50/50 average on telling them apart.\n\nThere are definitely movies where I have not realised that the two brunette love interests weren't the same person until they interacted with one-another in the last third of the movie.\n\nIn general I just accept that I'm probably not going to keep everyone's name in my head, and instead focus on enjoying the way the story moves.  I can learn names on a rewatch when I'm not trying to also take in a bunch of new information.",

The longer I remember the characters' names, the better time I had.\n\nHowever, forgetting a name this soon means you never remembered it in the first place. This happens to me only when the movie is so bad that I never finish it.\n\nIt's true that I still remember the entire script of Ice Age, word for word.

            "The first time 'round sets the stereotype.  There's a first femme fatale, there's a first wisecracking-badass, a first unlikely-hero-called-to-greatness, a first woman-in-a-man's-world, a first \"those two guys,\" and so on.  After that, most future characters you see are just that person with a different face.  Maybe someone comes along who's especially good, and they become the new standard -- but it's the same idea.  You mostly remember the first time and the best few that follow, and the rest just kind of blurs into a homogeneous mess.  \n\n(It's worse for me with these animated and CGI-heavy films that semi-recycle character art and totally recycle mannerisms, animations, background props, etc.)",

            "Related- yes, I often don\u2019t carry name knowledge to the end of a movie, even though I know I learned most of the obvious ones at some point. I similarly will forget names even in movies or TV shows I ha ent seen in even a little bit, even if I know their names concrete whenever I start watching again before I even hear them. \n\nBut something that blows my mind- I\u2019ve seen Inherent Vice 3 times and I really enjoy watching it, but on my third ride through it I was determined to pay attention because I never could really tell what the movie was about on either prior viewing and thought it was just me having a lazy mind. I still can\u2019t tell, and now I feel like it\u2019s the movie equivalent of a stroke simulator- one of those pictures where everything seems familiar but you can\u2019t see concrete details to identify them. I still can\u2019t tell if the movie is deliberately made that way though. It\u2019s not trippy, but it\u2019s, in a subtle way, like an acid trip where you think there\u2019s a cohesive center with realistic interactions but it\u2019s more just a fun ride that pleases the imagination and is almost completely null and inconsequential.",
            "It's funny you said this cause I just got done watching the most recent Godzilla movie that's got a huge cast and I noticed early on in the film that everyone is constantly repeating other characters names. In almost every scene a character will be looking directly at another character delivering their line only to end the sentence  with that person's name, as if the line wasn't obviously directed at them and they needed to be made aware they should pay attention. The more I noticed it the more annoying it got, and the ironic part is I still dont remember any of their names.",

I too often forget names in American movies and i think it\u2019s because the characters are called by their names like twice throughout the whole thing, the rest of the time its implied. Where as when i watch an anime, characters are called by their name like every other sentence because a name is more important in japan, so when the character is called by their name a lot i am way more likely to remember their name.

My understanding is that for a lot of couples, it's a lot harder to get pregnant and have a child survive until term than the media and others would lead you to believe. She is very sensitive about it, and I completely understand why. Going so far as to cut off social media because seeing other moms with their kids was making her really emotional on a lot of different levels. (Why isn't that me, What's wrong with me, etc. etc.)\n\nI don't want kids. Ever. So I'd be the one who used the test hoping for a no result. However, beyond that very slim circumstance, I am not watching or caring about pregnancy test commercials. (TBH I'd be more likely to go to a doc for a blood test anyway because that's more reliable.)  People who actually want to have a baby are, because they want fast and accurate results. \n\nWhen I think about my friend who really wants a baby watching a commercial where a person celebrates getting a 'not pregnant' result, I can tell she would be upset. Not angry at the commercial, but moreso, yet again, reminded of how sad her circumstances are and kind of upset that a commercial is reminding her about it while also having a person *celebrating* not being pregnant. \n\nSo it comes down to audience. I'm not watching those commercials as someone who doesn't want a baby, especially because I'm doubly responsible about birth control and would be at a doc in a flash if there were any signs there had been some kind of mishap.

            "This is likely to get buried but....... \n\nI suspect this has something to do with being truthful and biostatistics: Urinary pregnancy tests are sensitive tests and as such they are more reliable at detecting a pregnancy (True positives). In other words if they're positive you're very likely to be pregnant but if negative, you can't reliably rule out a pregnancy. With that said, if you put a woman with a positive pregnancy test result who looks glad she's pregnant it probably looks better than a woman with a sad face and a positive test result, she may be sad because she's pregnant but it may also be a false positive which means the pregnancy test isn't a good one. That can be distressing.\n\nWorth noting: Some tests sacrifice some specificity for a greater sensitivity. Pregnancy tests performed using blood samples are more specific and thus they are better at ruling out a pregnancy (true negatives).\n\n**BUT** all of these statistical measures of performance (pretest probabilities) vary depending on the day of the cycle and fecundation.

While if you're trying to have a baby, expescially if you're having difficulty conceiving, you're likely to buy many many tests. And these couples having trouble are are the ones that probably have the best reactions when it finally happens. So that's what they show in the commercial, to appeal to these couples that are probably going to be buying the most from them. \n\nAlso if you aren't planning on having a baby you probably aren't paying much attention to those commercials and you're not very likely to shop around for the best brand. You just go to a pharmacy and buy whatever they have. So the advertising on the box itself is more important in those cases.

            "Having rooftop access in your hypothetical scenario would be a game changer.  A Walmart's foot print is enormous, giving you plenty of roof area to grow and collect water.  Finding keys or even tools to bust any locks would be easy.\n\nBoredom and loneliness would probably get to you.  50 years is a long time. 10 would be hard, but maybe doable.",
            "Assuming the electricity stays on you'd probably be able to make it for 50 years. You would exhaust your fresh food in under one month, but you could preserve some of it before it goes bad by scouring the store for tupperware containers and ziploc baggies - you could then preserve lots of fresh fruits, vegetables, meats, eggs, etc. After exhausting that food (probably 3 years worth) you would target canned/bottled food. The \"best by\" date for most canned and bottled food is about 2-3 years, and that's only the \"best to sell before\" date rather than the date the food goes bad. So for the next 5-8 years you'd target (no pun intended) all of the canned/bottled food in WalMart, and if you're smart you'd take some of that food and freeze it in the 1000s of Tupperware containers and ziploc baggies still available. This might add another 5 years.  After 19 years you'd start transitioning to the frozen goods still stored in the many freezers....it might taste stale or 'off' but there's no reason to think it would be dangerous. So a conservative estimate, based on a typical Walmart store size, is that you'd last another 5-8 years on frozen food alone which gets you to the 27 year time period. You'd then transition to dry goods like pasta, rice, beans, cereals, etc, which you would hopefully have moved into the freezers in order to stave off dry rot. Cooking all of this food would be made easy by the many microwaves, camp stoves, and even BBQs that you would have found (an indoor BBQ using propane gas cylinders would be reserved for special occasions...the size of the store would mean that vented BBQ gasses indoors would not be a particulalr problem). Assuming you originally enter the store in the spring or summer season, you'd find bags and bags of gardening soil, so you could improvise garden beds (using grow lamps found in the garden section) and extend your beans by growing indoors. \n\nOverall, I'm confident one person could last 50 years in an electrified Walmart. Without electricity I seriously doubt anyone could last longer than 5-10 years.",

Much of it would spoil before then.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nEdit:\n\nThis is assuming the WalMart would have mice and rats, and that the canned goods would start to rust. The mice and rats would take care of the rice, beans, noodles, etc. in plastic bags. Canned foods in damaged cans (rust) will go bad. Yes, if you stored a case of canned Pork and Beans in a strictly temperature and humidity-controlled room it would last a long time. Under **normal** conditions, however, canned goods would go bad when the can went bad.\n\nI worked in a cannery.

I assume you can recycle urine, but you also have aisles full of liquid ... must be some way to make sure it doesn't sour ... I assume you would want to open all containers with liquid (soda, juice, etc) and burn off the sugar (which could spoil badly) and get pure water, and then store that as best as possible.  Would be interested to hear other strategies.\n\nEDIT: On the water problem, I think the key is to act immediately while you still have access to electricity (for boiling) and that you should do the following:\n\n* Take all the glass bottles in the store (the question is, are there enough - likely not)\n\n* Take all the non pure water in the store (fruit juice, soda, etc)\n\n* Boil the non pure water and capture the water vapor and store the water in the glass bottles\n\n* Add iodine tablets (from the camping section - but again, are there enough)\n\n* Store pure water in glass bottles in dark storage area out of the way\n\nOthers are saying that you can just rely on all the soda that will be in a walmart.  First, you need approximately 18K 2 liter bottles of soda to survive 50 years.  A regular walmart likely won't have that much (in my assumption, you do not have access to the back storage area).  Second, that soda will spoil due both to the sugar and more importantly the plastic storage.  Others say they would use rainwater.  In my assumption, you have no access to the outside, but if you can access the roof then obviously rainwater is the solution assuming there hasn't been some sort of radiation or similar contaminating event.",

            "**With Power and Water:** Get all the meat and dairy products into the walk-in freezer immediately. That will give you time to start dehydrating all of the meat for later use. There are recipe books with the dehydrators so you know how much salt to use to keep it from spoiling.  Start dehydrating all the produce as well. Use the ovens in the bakery and deli set on low to get all that done. There are plenty of racks and trays to get a ton of it started on day 1. Use vacuum sealers to package everything, then store all that in big plastic totes stored in an area that you surround with insect and rat poison.\n\n**No Power or Water:** Still get all the meat and dairy into the freezer. Take all the produce to the walk-in refrigerator. It'll last longer while you set up some drying racks on the roof. Use volleyball nets and fish nets to keep the birds off your food. Salt it heavily to keep pests off while it's drying. If there are any sunny windows set racks in front of them, too. Dehydrate as much food as you can in the few days you've got. Get some grills going to dehydrate food. Salt as much of the meat as you can to help preserve it.\n\nSet up totes and play pools on the roof to collect rain water. Don't concentrate too much water collection in one area, or it'll cave in the roof.\n\nSet up pools to grow gold fish larger. Might work.\n\nStart farming. Use play pools and tarps to make garden beds filled with soil from the garden section. Read some books on gardening and get seeds started. Start composting your food scraps for eventual fertilizer needs...if you ever run out of the store bought stuff.\n\nIn an apocalyptic situation eventually you'll need to seal up all the toilets and drains with plastic to keep out sewer gas once the water in the traps evaporates.\n\nGet good at catching rats to eat for protein. Those cans of chili aren't going to last forever, bud.\n\nNo matter what, figure out where you're going to dump trash and waste on day 1. Outside away from the building. If you're locked inside, get to the roof, and fling that shit as far as you can. Eventually you'll need to build a trebuchet to get some distance. Might need to keep a rifle handy to pick off the wild animals that will absolutely love your trash heap.\n\nYou've got a shit ton of work to do.\n\nEdit: You can find books on canning next to mason jars. That's another solid way to preserve as much produce and meat as possible with the supplies on hand. Should give you another year of food storage. There may also be info on fermented foods like sourkraut and kimchi. You can ferment lots of foods to preserve them. Also, they may have sausage making kits. If so, you have another good avenue for preserving as much meat as possible. Plus, when the time comes you'll know just what to do with all that rat meat:-)\n\nEdit 2: Speaking of fermentation, you can brew ciders and wines from a lot of the fruit on hand. Get that started too. Everything you need to make a crude pot still to distill alcohol can be found in the cooking equipment and hardware sections...so I've heard.",

Since its a hypothetical im going with the fact that you WILL have electricity despite being trapped. In that case you can work on beating every game on any platform you prefer while youre not eating/farming. Walmart sells guns so you can hunt any critters that cone and try to steal your food. So long as a diet of rats and potatoes doesnt give you some weird super aids, i think you could do it if you outlast suicide.\n\n Actually the more i think about it, if theres nobody else with you and after 50 years youre just freed, its basically just a prison with a LOT of shit to do.

            "Despite your large amounts of food, you'd still have to factor in expiration dates, especially if the walmart in question is truly abandoned and you have no new resources coming in. Your best bet would be to utilize everything in the gardening section and grow your own fruit and vegetables.  \n\n\nDisclaimer: OP is Australian and has never been to a walmart, so is uncertain if walmart even has a gardening section with potting mix and seeds.",
            "technically you could just go on the rooftop and signal for help but that's cheating\n\nok, so all the perishable goods (fresh meat, eggs, veggies) are gonna go in... lets say 2-3 months with varying degrees\n\nwhats left are the canned goods but those expire too,so you will die in 10 years.\n\nthat is, unless you start a farm on the rooftop, which can be done using the soil, the tools and some seed from the Walmart.\n\nclothes are in abundance, and assuming electricity exists you can even get some entertainment from the computers.\n\nbad thing is if you take a bad fall one day and break some bone really bad you're dead.  If any major infection strikes you're also dead.",
            "I mean if you die within a year or two, technically you survived the rest of your life there",
            "If you start at a time of year when the garden center is open, it should be a lot easier.  Build yourself some nice raised beds under the skylights, install some soaker hose connected to a rain catchment system from the roof.  Bam.  You have Canning supplies and dehydrators in home goods.  Plus all the freezers if they are still working. My main worry for canning would be running out of propane to heat the water (using camp stoves)  Don't forget to compost all the leftovers from the produce department that you can't either eat or preserve.",
            "Read a book on how to grow vegetables, make a food garden put of the outdooor section, and you'll live as long as the sun shines.",
            "Technically, yes, but it wouldn't be as long as you think.",
            "I mean if you're implying that you would eat only the food in there and not make any of your own then no because it would run out pretty quickly.",
            "All these comments about water and leaks, etc. Every Walmart has an outdoor gardening section. Just set up rain barrels and you\u2019re good.",
            "If Matt Damon can survive on other planets, you can very well survive at least in a Walmart.",
            "If its abandoned, then it's pretty safe to assume that the water and electricity are going to be turned off within a few weeks, in which case you're completely fucked.",
            "With power alot of your immediate problems go away, but I'll focus on no power.\n\nDepends, but it would be hard as your current level of food a lot will go bad in a week with no power so time is of the essence at the beginning. Moving as much to the back freezer/refrigerator is first move as this will allow more time to dehydrate the food and eating good the first week as you wont get it all as time is against you. \n-Next you will need to find a way to trap and distill water... as much as you can as your eating sources(even though abundant now) are limited. Tarps on the room spread out will be able to trap rain water so cut open the empty gas cans or other clean plastic containers for storage. \n-Now that your produce is starting to turn learning to compost is the next big thing you should learn as you will need some reusable food and bad produce is great. Set up some planter boxes on the roof as to get sun light and water or else you'll be using your own supply which you definitely cant do that. \n-Next big thing you need to learn is self aid as most walmarts have a pharmacy and basic medical supplies. In survival situations an injury(even small) can turn deadly(ie tetanus) so learning to clean and sanitize injuries is key while also learning what meds do what so you can get some antibiotics or other goods to not get high on.\n-Next I would get proficient at using a bow and some walmarts still have them as you may need to kill an animal for food. Baiting an area on the roof with seeds or other goodies can lure in birds. While not a high calorie source of food it maybe vital for survival. If this is say an Apocalyptic event that we are in than using the meat you have can lure in large carnivorous animals by placing it in the back with a door open and if you cant kill them fast you are in for a world of shit.",
            "Interesting question. Heads up: I'm going for it.\n\nIf you're willing to be a little hungry, you can be fine on 1800 kcals/day. Keep in mind that you have the vitamin section, which will provide all your nutritional needs except raw calories. \n\nThe average Walmart throws away between 8 and 15 waste bins of food per week (as per some independent journalism from 2017). Each bin is 40 gallons. This means 320-600 gallons of food thrown away daily. Let's say your walmart of choice comes in shy of the middle, at 400 gallons.\n\nSome food is more dense than other food, but most is within a couple error bars of the density of water. A gallon of water weighs eight pounds, so we're looking at about 3200 pounds of food per week.\n\nObviously this is produce and baked goods. Canned goods aren't going to expire at this rate. Carbs and protein have an energy density of about 4 calories per gram, while fats are just over 9 calories per gram. Between produce and bakery, let's assume an average of 7 calories per gram (don't forget the deli). 3200 pounds is about 1450 kg, or 10,000 food calories (1 food calorie is 1000 calories) thrown away per week. Most produce has a shelf life of about two weeks, and baked goods average, broadly to the same. So in two weeks, they've thrown out all they'll throw out, meaning 20,000 kcal (food calories) thrown away.\n\nWalmart throws away 15-20% of its produce (let that sink in). Let's say yours is bad about this and hits 20%. That means that at any given time, you can expect there to be about 100,000 kcals of produce in the store. That's a good starting point.\n\nThe dairy section adds roughly triple to quadruple caloric content as produce/bakery (which I thought was crazy, but then I remembered butter). Let's go on the low end and say triple. Now you're at 400,000 kcals of fresh, perishable food.\n\nProduce becomes easier for our bodies to break down when it's cooked, giving it an increased net calorie count (less energy used to break it down means we get a better return on investment). Depending on the food, this increase is between 10 and 30%. Let's average that to 20%. Our 400,000 kcals just became 500,000 kcals. Of course we're going to plug in some electric griddles and cook.\n\n500,000 kcals right off the bat. There is adequate refrigeration, so we'll actually be able to utilize this, too. It won't be pleasant, but it's survival.\n\nNext up: frozen food. This is a goldmine. Frozen packaged food has a huge energy density (close to 10 cals/gram (10 kcals/kg). Walmart has 3-4 aisles of frozen food. One of those is veggies/low-cal health food, so I'll ignore that one, but round energy density up to an even 10 kcals/kg. One double door freezer has a capacity of 50 cu ft, which is a terrible unit of volume. Call it 80% full, that's 300 gallons. Turn the crank a couple times, and you get about 11,000 kcals per freezer. These freezers are 54\" wide (hooray for published spec sheets) each, and aisles are ~60 ft long. This means about 13 freezers on each side of the aisle, plus one on each end cap. 30 freezers per aisle, times 2-3 aisles is ~75 freezers. 11,000 kcals/freezer gives 825,000 kcals. This is a a estimate. Add that to the 500,000 from before, and you're up to 1.3M kcals.\n\nCoffee creamer comes in at a disgustingly high 3500 kcals/bottle (everything in moderation). Stocking 50 bottles (likely an underestimate) adds another 175,000 kcals. We're up to 1.5M kcals.\n\nThe chip aisle adds 2200 kcals/bag for plain chips. Double for barbecue. A bag is about 8\" wide, be these are packed right next to each other. You might get five rows of chips. Assuming the rows are four bags deep, that gives 1800 bags of chips (feels like too large of a number, but the math checks out. 1800 bags at 3000 kcals/bag (averaging low) is 4.8M kcals. We're up to 6.3M kcals.\n\nA box of cereal has about the same caloric count as a bag of chips. Similar in dimensions, too. Let's call those even. Add another 4.8M kcals. That's 11.1M kcals.\n\nA vegetable oil bottle (48 Oz) contains 96 tablespoons, each at 125 kcals. That's 11,500 kcals per bottle. Stocking 30 of these and 20 of the economy size gives North of 800,000 kcals. Up to 12M.\n\nI'll save you some rather gross math on condiments and salad dressing, but tell you we're conservatively up to 16M.\n\nCanned soup adds ~200 kcals/can. With the dimensions of the can, you're looking at 4000-5000 cans of soup/broth, so add another million kcals. 17M.\n\nThis estimate for soup is actually a decent estimate per side of an aisle for food, in general. We've looked at about five aisles worth of stuff, so maybe about 10-12 remain. Let's say 10. A million kcals per side of an aisle, times ten aisles, gives 10M kcals. We're at 27M.\n\nBeef, chicken, turkey, bacon, sausage, etc. On average, you're getting 1500 kcals/pound of meat. A decent guess, based on empirical evidence, is that a grocery store stocks somewhere in the area of two tons of meat. That adds a clean 3M kcals. We're up to 30M.\n\nSo. 1800 kcals/day. 30M kcals to work with. That's 16,667 days, or 45 years and 8 months. You're almost up to the 50 years you wanted. Let's get those lady four years, four months. We'll need 2.8M kcals to get there. \n\nPet food. Dog food has ~420 kcals per cup. One 40 lb bag holds 160 cups, giving 65,000 kcals per bag. 43 bags of dog food get you the rest of the way to your 50 miserable years. \n\n\n\n\nYou could do it, but you won't like it."

Have.  Mercy.  \n\nIt made me appreciate how different people could be smart at different things.  The kids who turned in 0 homework assignments had shurikens zipping around the room in no time--making them bigger or smaller, adding patterns with markers.  The kids who book smart had to sit around me watching step by step by step to do it.  There were a few kids who just couldn't do it because their spatial ability was so limited.  \n\nThe dean gave in school suspension to a couple of my kids for ninja fights during the passing period.
