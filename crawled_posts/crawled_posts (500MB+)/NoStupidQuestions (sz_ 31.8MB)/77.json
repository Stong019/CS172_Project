            "You\u2019re going through sugar detox. \nCaffeine will be the first to knock you. Then the sugar withdrawal kicks in. Sugar is an addictive substance and alters your brain chemistry. \nThe stages of sugar withdrawal are like other hard drugs, you feel worse before you get better. \nYour body will come through it shortly.\nWell done on making a positive change to your lifestyle.",
            "Diabetic here (type 2). \n\nThe sugar withdrawal is probably not making you feel tired. The major effects sugar has on you blood is to cause massive swings in energy. When you eat pure sugar, like candy and soda, your body just puts that shit right in your bloodstream for use. It thinks you're giving it energy to use foe something like exercise. So you blood sugar goes up, but your muscles don't use enough of that sugar. And too much sugar in your blood for too long is bad for your body (if I remember correctly, it will damaged your arteries, but please correct me if I'm wrong, reddit).\n\nSo your body stores the sugar using insulin. The insulin enters your blood stream, binds to the sugar, and then stores that energy in fat.\n\nIf you eat things like bread or meat, the same process happens, but it takes long and you get less of a sugar spike. Which is good. Those types of foods eventually get made into sugar, but they need more digestion time. So it's like a slow-release pill of energy, instead of medicine. \n\nBut what goes up must comes down. High blood sugar spikes lead to big dips. You're kinda teaching your body to be wary of those massive spikes. And you're also building up a tolerance to the effectiveness of your natural insulin. \n\nBut when you start eating healthier and smoothing our those spikes, you get less blood sugar crashes. The best way to help this is to go for brisk walks immediately after eating a big meal. \n\nBut all of this is to say...getting out of these spiking cycles shouldn't give you less energy, but rather, should make things feel more even. More balanced. You get fewer highs and fewer lows. \n\nSo no, it's not the sugar causing your dips in energy anymore.",

It can be hard to just drink water for the sake of it like you can with soda or juice. Maybe compare how much you drink in a day now compared to how much you drank from drinking other drinks.\n\nDehydration is a very common cause of energy loss and most people forget about this and jump straight to the energy rich foods as cause for concern.",

It makes you feel calm but alert. That's how I got off a decade long coffee habit, now I enjoy coffee on the occasion.",
            "Yes, that is exactly the reason, along with the lack of caffeine. Your blood sugar is a lot lower than it used to be, so you feel sluggish.\n\nI went on the keto diet about 6 months ago and I used to drink a ton of soda and like 1-3 cups of coffee a day. After a month of just drinking seltzer and water a lost a bunch and my insulin stabilized (I'm not diabetic, just it was constantly high since I consumed a fuckload of sugar) I felt a lot better. I'm getting off of keto now, but I still feel fine, and am trying to stay away from all sugary beverages. If I want something sugary I go for something sweetened with sucralose ( coke zero or Pepsi 1) or stevia.\n\nOnce you are off it for a while and then go back to drinking a can of the regular stuff you notice that it's ridiculously sweet.

            "Are you still going to bed at the same time as when you were drinking the soda?  If you're used to going to bed pretty late that could have been a function of the caffeine keeping you awake later rather than your body's natural rhythm.  When I quit caffeine before I had to reset my internal clock by going to bed pretty early (sometimes 8pm) for a little while until I adjusted to the lack of caffeine.  Once my body adjusted, I figured out my natural bedtime (e.g. when I got tired enough to sleep) was around 9:30pm.",

It can bring benefits, but in excess it can make it so when you don't have it your system is slower and more tired than normal.    \n\n\nBalance is a good thing.",
            "Yes. The change from soda to water means you are \n\n1. Substituting a high calorie drink for a 0 calorie drink. Depending on how many sodas you drank per day can range 100-1000 calories that are filled with sugar and low nutrient ingredients. Your body will loose weight when in a caloric deficit. \n\n2. Your body's main porpoise is survival and when the body does not receive adequate water it stores it. Once you drink enough water per day the body will rid itself of the stored water which will reduce puffiness and bloating. Water weight does not equal fat so when you say you are loosing weight its a combination of water weight and fat from now consuming less calories per day. In time your body will regulate and you will stick to a specific weight unless your start changing your food diet as well. \n\n3. Unless you were drinking caffeine free soda, the soda you were drinking is a mixture of caffeine and sugar. Sugar is a simple carbohydrate that when consumed is turned into glycogen quicker and used for energy which is why added sugar is not good for most diets. \n\n4: In terms of caffeine [here is a vide explaining its effects.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpeE6dQQ_j4)",

            "It would not be possible to make an exact stylistic remake that meets modern safety and emissions standards. Just as one example: the \"A\" pillar is the name for the piece of metal that frames the windshield and attaches to the roof; [here's a picture showing the various roof pillars.](https://www.drivingtesttips.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/car-pillars.jpg) \n\nAbout ten or fifteen years ago, the people who do safety testing on cars (IIHS, NHTSA) noticed that rollover accidents tended to result in more deaths and serious injuries. They found that this was happening because car roofs tended to deform and collapse in rollovers, smashing directly into the heads of the passengers. So, they came up with a standard for how strong a roof has to be, and implemented crash tests to evaluate this. Automakers realized pretty quickly that one of the easiest and cheapest ways to make a roof stronger is to make the \"A\" pillar a lot thicker. And that's why [modern cars have such thick \"A\" pillars compared to older cars.](http://payload.cargocollective.com/1/2/84448/1064602/pilla1%20copy%20copy.jpg)\n\nIf you want to drive a car that looks old but has modern features, there is hope: some people will restore old cars and replace the original parts with modern ones. This process is called resto-modding. Generally, people perform resto-modding with an eye to improving performance: using modern powertrains, modern suspensions, modern brakes, etc. A resto-modded classic car probably won't do any better in an actual crash, but your ability to avoid getting into a crash in the first place would be greatly improved vs. the original, un-modified car.",

Has to be reflected in the price (negative).\n\nAdditionally, it wouldn't pass various regulations. Both environmental and safety. Original '69 Corvettes are grandfathered in, or even given protected antique status, but a remake wouldn't get that. I don't think there are loopholes or tricks that would let it be street legal.\n\nEven if all these things could be circumvented somehow, Corvettes only sell about 3000 units per year anymore (I think). It's not alot, so your throwback would have to do many more than that to justify it. And without some sort of proof that it would sell say 25,000 units or 70,000 or whatever, no one would greenlight it. The American car companies are shit, coasting on made-in-the-USA chauvinism and borderline ignorance. They're \"too big to fail\".\n\nNever going to see anything clever or unexpected from them. Maybe a European car maker would go for it, but no one's exactly itching for the 1963 Fiat Berlina.",
            "The land rover defender is probably the best example of this being done.  And it looks skookum as frig.",
            "Auto design engineer, here.\n\nThere are a lot of people pointing out the safety and emissions standards that wouldn\u2019t be met.  They are correct.  There are many regulations that wouldn\u2019t be met and trying to make an old design meet those standard while not changing its looks would be overly difficult and expensive.\n\nWhat I haven\u2019t seen mentioned is the ability to actually pump those old cars out.\n\nFor instance, doors are typically a sandwich in the there\u2019s the outer \u201cskin\u201d (the outside metal you can touch), the \u201clining\u201d (the inside cloth/plastic portion you can touch inside the car), and the door \u201cpanel\u201d (the part inside the door that is the actual door).\n\nThe door panel is typically a complicated piece of stamped steel.  This requires a relatively large mold to be used.  Over time, those molds wear out - the corners/fillets/curves start to wear down and lose a bit of their shape.  As time/use goes on, that little bit of dimension changes stacks up and eventually, the door won\u2019t go together anymore or even worse, it goes together but the door won\u2019t close after 100 closes.\n\nSo keep in mind that there\u2019s a lot of manufacturing pieces that would all have to be remade, carefully inspected and repaired.  Some may even need redesigned if old drawings can\u2019t be found.  Drawings may even need to be converted to 3D models to be able to be used for current tooling systems.  Very expensive.\n\n\u201cTool\u201d costs (costs associated with the tools needed to make parts) are spread out across all sold vehicles and for a car that was previously very popular (the kind of car you\u2019d want to remake), those costs were spread out of many vehicles.  A remake would almost definitely sell the same or fewer units, meaning the tooling costs would be spread as thinly.  This means every vehicle very well could be significant more expensive (relative to its release year).\n\nThere\u2019s also the issue of reliability.  Imagine buying a car that was doing well to hit 60k miles.  This will inevitably reflect poorly on your brand name.  Your \u201cGoodwill\u201d asset takes a hit.  Could try to make up for it in vehicle price but you\u2019ve already had to set that price pretty high.\n\nSo you have safety, reliability, and other regulatory issues and that doesn\u2019t include unforeseeable issues that are inevitable like not know that cigarette lighters of the time couldn\u2019t handle phone chargers and when used, they set the electrical system on fire.\n\nIt\u2019s a huge gamble, even if the seemingly impossible problems could be solved.  To top it off auto industry is very risk averse.  You\u2019d be putting your career on the line to support that kind of plan.",
            "A lot of old designs simply do not meet modern safety standards. Then beyond that a lot of old models are not really that well optimised in wind tunnels either. \n\nThough there is still some throwbacks being made, but they are quite ugly imo. ",

Automotive manufacturing assembly lines are very specifically designed to churn out an exact model of car hundreds of times a day.

            "Modern crash safety, emissions and fuel economy requirements are impossible to meet with older car designs. Their shapes aren't very crash friendly and the overall design isn't aerodynamic by today's standards.  \n\nCar makers have gotten around this by buying back old cars and restoring them to factory new condition. Nissan did this with their 240Z. Jaguar recently did this with their E-type. They tend to be much more expensive than buying an unrestored one because of the cost in labor of rebuilding everything essentially from scratch. It's not a profitable business venture for car companies. For example, a factory restored 69 Corvette would have to cost well into the six figures for it to make money for Chevrolet. You can just buy an original mint condition 69 Corvette for a lot less.",

            "Ask ralph nader.",
            "The truth is, the vast majority of old cars were terrible. Safety was god awful yes, but everything else was awful too. They were inefficient (and by that I mean they were both horrible on gas also had pretty poor performance for the amount of power they did have), they were loud (not just pleasant motor sounds mind you but squeaks and wind noise etc), and handled poorly (lots of play in the steering wheel, awful turning radii, etc). \n\nHave you ever driven a classic car? You feel like you're on the edge of death compared to modern cars. \n\nDon't get me wrong, there were many amazing cars and a million reasons to want to own or drive a classic. They capture a certain feeling of freedom and nostalgia and many are very beautiful. They also make you feel more connected to the road since they're so mechanically simple.  but most people who want a car that looks and feels like a classic can go buy or restore a classic. There isn't a mass market need. \n\nMost people want a car that's safe and quiet and good on gas. So if you take a classic mustang and make it safe and quiet and good on gas, once you add crumple zones and air bags and larger A-pillars and insulation and advanced modern engines with modern emissions systems and power steering and anti -lock brakes etc etc etc, it ends up looking something like a new mustang. Which, btw, sell like hot cakes.\n\nThere are some companies that do what you're suggesting though, in small quantities. VW only recently stopped making the original beetle in some countries. Land Rover only recently stopped making a Defender that was pretty close to the pure classic defenders. You can go buy a new delorean that looks just like the original delorean but it's now electric. \n\nMaybe most interesting and perhaps the best modern example as it relates to your point though, go check out [Singer Vehicle Design](http://www.singervehicledesign.com). They believe the original Porsche 911 was the perfect car. So they take original 70s 911 donor cars and add modern tech, engines, comfort and to some reduced degree, safety. Their cars are absolutely gorgeous, and retail accordingly ($300,000+)\n\n\n\n",

            "In early 1997, Nissan(Datsun) re-released restored models of the 240z that they had been snatching up used all over. you could essentially buy a mint 1969(if in japanese market) 1970,1971,1972, 240z off the lot like it was just off the factory floor. They only finished a handful of them due to costs vs. sales, so they stopped which was a damn shame. It just goes to show that while it can work, the market has to be right. And as far as I can tell, this is the closest a popular car got to an actual re-release instead of just releasing a new model that looks Aesthetically similar to its predecessor. They took the exact same vehicles, \"improved\" them with regulatory nonsense and safety spiel, then pushed them into the void. The market just wasn't right. being a Z head then and being one now is a very different feeling I imagine because just in recent years has these cars value shot up like crazy. I being a proud owner of one of these original rust buckets wish they'd do this program again because I think sales would explode. But knowing Modern Nissan, they'd fuck it up.

Beautiful vehicle.  \n\nAlso, Land Rover has been producing the [Defender/Series](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_Rover_Defender) since 1948 (last production in January 2016) essentially unchanged for 68 years minus a few changes from the Series I, II, IIA, and III to what is now known as the Defender. Aside from a few safety modifications, the only major changes between the years are engines (2.5 diesel, petrol, 200tdi, 300tdi, TD5, etc) and cosmetic changes to the interior dash (to name a few). If I remember correctly, one of the major contributions to ceasing production is because of the man hours put into making the Defender. Where newer model Range Rovers, Discovery's (LR3 and 4s), etc can be done quickly with machines that you see in most modern plants, the Defender was still given the same love and care...bolt by bolt...by individual line workers. So, the process was slighlty slower and a lot more costly due to the personnel hired.  \n\nThe US saw the Defender from 1994 to 1997 (NAS) but was taken off of the market specifically due to safety concerns as Land Rover didn't want to implement air bags and a few other regulations imposed by the US.  \n\nThese bad boys can go anywhere from $20k to $200k in the US depending on condition. I imported mine from the UK for $10k and even in it's current condition (a bit of rust, wiring issues, etc) I can probably get $25k for it. Truly magnificent vehicles. I love them.",

            "I've learned about the gate control effect. You gotta know that receptors in our body who send pain signals to our brain send their signal slower than so called mechanoreceptors. These receptors send signals of pressure on our skin to our brain. If you have a toothache and you push on it you send another signal to your brain which kinda overlays the pain signal (very simplified). This is also why we automatically put our hands on our forehead when heaving a headache, it has no healing effect, it just stimulates your mechanoreceptors.\n\nPlease correct me if im wrong, and sorry for any misspelling or false translation.",

            "Neurobiologist here, not a pain expert but I know some things about it - my best guess is that at some level in the pathways of the sensory nerve fibres to your brain, there is cross-inhibition between different types of sensory fibre so that when a signal from one is increased, it suppresses the signal from other nerve fibres transmitting from the same body region. This happens in the spinal cord when you scratch an itch (the pain signal suppresses further transmission of the fibres carrying the itch signal), which is what I'm basing this  idea on. Facial nerves don't synapse in the spinal cord though, so where exactly it occurs in this case I don't know since this isn't my area and that's probably more depth than necessary. In your example t would be the pressure suppressing the pain.\n\nThe other suggestion that it increases release of endogenous painkillers in the short term also sounds quite likely to me, and these two explanations aren't necessarily mutually exclusive :)",

This can be done with various techniques:\n\n\\-Lay on my back with a tennis ball placed directly underneath the painful zone (so yeah, basically, put pressure on it)\n\n\\-Connecting a TENS device to my back (basically giving me electrics chocs around the painful zone on my back).

            "Let me introduce you to [pain gate control theory.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gate_control_theory)",
            "I think that most of the answers here that talk about pain receptors and our brain\u2019s interpretations of pain are at least partially correct. \n\nIt may also be interesting to consider something called \u2018benign masochism\u2019. The following is from this bbc article (https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20151001-why-pain-feels-good). I think this could at least partially answer your question.\n\n\n\u201cOne theory to explain it is \u2018benign masochism\u2019 \u2013 seeking out pain while maintaining the awareness that it won\u2019t cause serious damage. It\u2019s something animals aren\u2019t capable of doing.\n\nHot chillis can trigger pleasurable responses... eventually (Credit: Thinkstock)\nOne example is chilli. The active ingredient, capsaicin, is harmless. It hurts because it happens to bind to TRPV1, part of a family of temperature-sensitive receptors in our tongues which alert the body to potentially damaging heat or cold. Activating TRPV1 sends the brain the same signals as if the tongue was actually on fire.\n\n\nThe theory is also thought to explain why we seek out and enjoy other intrinsically unpleasant experiences, such as fear-inducing rollercoasters or sad movies. \u201cIf an animal took a rollercoaster it would be scared, and it would never go again.\u201d says Rozin.\n\nThe link between sex and pain is not confined to the world of BDSM. One study, in which researchers used fMRI to visualise the brains of women as they stimulated themselves to climax, found that more than 30 areas of the brain were active, including those involved in pain. Another found that cancer survivors, who had nerves in their spinal cord cut to relieve chronic abdominal pain, lost the ability to have orgasms. If their pain returned, so did the orgasms. \n\nBarry Komisaruk from Rutgers University, who authored the imaging study, thinks there\u2019s a fundamental link between pain and orgasm pathways. \u201cAnother observation is that the facial expressions during orgasm are often indistinguishable from those in pain,\u201d he says.\u201d",
            "Most comments here are true, but I also know that applying pain in any way in your body estimulates production of endorphin (that\u2019s why some people cut themselves when they are depressed for example), so that\u2019s a way to see it as well",
            "[deleted]",
            "If I had to guess, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a combination of factors. \n\nOthers have mentioned that pain signals release endorphins, which is true. I would also suggest the effect of relative deprivation, or to use another common phrase, \u201cmoving the goalposts.\u201d The pain level was at a constant 6, then when you made it worse, it went up to an 8. To your normal state of 0 pain (hopefully), 6 is a lot. But to someone who\u2019s just been at an 8, 6 is much better. \n\nSemi-related is gate control theory, which posits that the brain will deprioritize some sensory input in order to focus on another more serious input. \u201cOne pain can lessen another.\u201d",
            "Story time.\n\nThis will sound insane, and people will probably say I'm full of shit.. but at one point I was suffering from some pretty miserable tooth pain, and nothing seemed to help. I remember having to get up at various points in the night because it somehow helped minimize the pain for a short period, but the pain would always come back full force when I would go to lay back down. Anyway, I remember laying in bed one night, and the only thing I could think of was the pain. No other thoughts were going through my head except \"ow, ow, ow, fuck, ow, I want to fucking rip my tooth out.\" etc. Now, I have a very vivid imagination, so much so that someone can just vaguely describe a graphic scene or accident and I will visualize the scene until I make myself sick. I will literally walk away from a conversation if I think someone is about to describe something awful. I don't have photographic memory, but I can picture things in my mind very vividly, it's just not tied to memory. So, I'm Iaying in bed and imagining my tooth, throbbing with pain, isolated from my mouth, almost like it's floating in space. I began to visualize that a small bandage was slowly being wrapped around the tooth, starting at the base and working its way up, like a tiny tooth mummy. Once I visualized the tooth being completely wrapped, I imagined a thumb being placed on the very top, so the bandage wouldn't unravel. As soon as I held the bandage on place with the thumb, the pain fucking stopped. It stopped for about 5 seconds until I had the thought \"no fucking way did I just remove the pain with my mind\" and immediately the pain came rushing back as soon as I lost the visualization. I kept trying, and could only make it happen about two more times, but only for a couple seconds each. It became increasingly tougher to get to the thumb portion of the process, as I kept on fucking up the wrapping part. Anyway, I'm pretty convinced that I literally blocked the pain through visualization. If anyone has a story like this, I'd love to hear it. If you think I'm lying, that's fine. But that shit happened, and I will always feel like I have an untapped superpower because of it.\n\nEdit: typo",

This same concept is why we tend to grab injuries when they happen (like grabbing our foot if we\u2019ve stubbed our toe). The second action sends a neural signal which cancels out the original pain signal. Thus, when you push on a toothache all you feel is the new pain; the original neural signal from the toothache no longer makes it to the brain. In short, the brain can generally only interpret one touch/pain signal at a time, so when there are multiple signals you only receive the most recent one. Hope this helps!",

I discovered this in 1992 ... no drugs no sugery no living in hope ... just solid pain release every time. \n\nPushing or pressing on a painful area gets the brain to investigate it. It releases whatever it can ... mainly muscle ... thats it. \n\nTooth ache ... well thats usually damaged tooth causing abraision or infected gum or  gomophis (gum tooth joint). Pushing displaces by expanding the tissues but that fills up with more infection or resettles on the broken part of the tooth. \n\nWhat I discovered is that the brain can not directly get rid of infectionsn but can release cramped muscles due to injury and RSI. \n\nHope this helps ...",

If you train it enough on bigger and bigger stuff, there's almost no limit on the size of whatever you can fit. This is why fisting is possible (and even a thing) - after months/years of stretching your butt will just naturally be able accommodate stuff that gets that big. Now imagine the size of your average penis - it really doesn't take much time at all to get to the point where it feels pleasurable. Usually for most dudes, after about 10 minutes of working up and getting used to things you'll have it your average dick fully accommodated and there's no pain or feeling of being stretched too much.\n\nAlso, poop is soft. If you try using a very soft dildo you'll find it probably doesn't hurt that much either. Hard things are harder to get used to but even they will work.",

That said, if it's painful, you're doing something very wrong.\n\nAnal should be mildly uncomfortable initially, until you relax a few muscles, but if you're really feeling pain, you should stop immediately. You're either not using enough lube or your penetrator is an idiot who's trying to give you a blow job from the inside.\n\nIf you don't use proper lube, tearing can result. You do not want tearing.

Then there\u2019s about an inch or two of space that makes up a tiny \u2018pouch\u2019 and then another ring of muscle that generally stays closed all the time.\n\nWhen you have a log pending, it stimulates the inside of the inner ring of muscle with pressure as well as some gas pressure.\n\nThis stimulation gets your body ready to drop the deuce - your sphincter muscles get ready to relax and the inner sphincter starts to open.   This is the \u201coh shit I gotta shit\u201d moment - now it\u2019s all up to your ability to keep sphincter 2 closed with willpower to stop from shutting your pants.\n\nWith things coming the other way, none of this pre-stimulation happens to your muscles are not relaxed.   \n\nSo generally - if it\u2019s hurting - you need to take more time to stimulate your body and relax it - slowly.\n\nALSO just fyi this is how your body knows if you have to shit or fart!  If there is no physical pressure in \u2018the pouch\u2019 then your body feels comfortable relaxing just a bit to relieve the gas pressure.  \nSometimes though - the fart is hiding a sneaky turd so watch out.",

He is expected to be discharged from hospital this week.\n\u201cSome war injuries are hidden,\u201d says WP John Lee, who led the surgical team at Johns Hopkins Hospital, in Maryland. Their patient lost part of his penis along with his scrotum and lower abdominal wall as a result of an improvised explosive device blast in Afghanistan. In a 14-hour operation, the team connected 3 arteries, 4 veins and two nerves \u2013 which should provide the new tissue with an adequate blood supply and nerve sensation, the team say.\nThe man was also given an infusion of bone marrow from the same donor. This should help his immune system accept the new tissue, and limit the amount of immunosuppressant medication he will need to take in the future.\n\nAlthough the man\u2019s testicles were also damaged, he did not receive testicular tissue from the donor. \u201cWe made a decision early in the programme to not transplant\u2026tissue that generates sperm,\u201d says Damon Cooney, one of the nine plastic surgeons on the team. The chance that genetic material from the donor could be passed to the recipient\u2019s offspring would raise difficult ethical questions, he says.\n\nRead more:\u00a0https://www.newscientist.com/article/2167136-war-veteran-gets-worlds-first-penis-and-scrotum-transplant/#ixzz6hC9GgMiK",
