            "Most surgeons do a set of surgeries routinely, and can practically do those in their sleep. There might be another procedure within their specialty that s/he doesn't do routinely, and they would typically look that one up beforehand or consult with a more familiar colleague. (I'm an anesthesiologist.)\n\nEdit: I just woke up and my inbox had exploded overnight. I'm working through and trying to reply where needed, sorry for the delay. ",
            "Like others have said, many surgeons are specialists and only really do a handful of procedures. There are times that they will encounter something they have to reference before performing. \n\nI worked with an orthopedic physician who only performed total hip and knee replacements. There are various techniques he would use depending on the severity of the condition and demographics of the patient. Like many doctors, he would occasionally have to be on call. He told me that something came in he hadn\u2019t seen in a long time (non total replacement procedure) and had to check a book to brush up before cutting. \n\nI am also with emergency medicine physicians quite a bit. They are constantly texting, calling, reading up on things for consults about what to do next. Not that they don\u2019t know what to do, but just to get opinions on course of treatment. This doesn\u2019t pertain to surgical procedures or trauma patients, but uncommon things coming in. ",

            "Neurosurgeon here. So most surgeons these days tend to subspecialize - you end up with your cardiac surgeons, vascular, orthopedic, plastics, neurosurgery etc. Even in a specialized field like neurosurgery, you'll have super-specialization such as spine, vascular, pediatrics, functional, skull-base, tumor etc. So every neurosurgeon can do basic procedures, like taking out a blood clot, or decompressing a herniated spinal disc. But not every surgeon can do a big tumor deep inside the brain, or a massive degenerative spinal reconstruction, or a deep brain stimulation. \n\nAnd even in those specialties, you'll sometimes end up with rare operations. Those are times when the surgeons will hit the text books and refresh themselves on the anatomy and steps of the procedures. Yes, there are lots of videos available on the neurosurgical journal websites that go through these operations as well. Sometimes we'll pop down to the cadaver lab go look at a brain, or for a spinal case, make a 3-D model of the area to plan the surgery.",
            "Many surgeons are specialists, so they will not have to know all the surgeries that are done in the hospital. A neurosurgeon is not going to do open-heart surgery, and a cardiovascular surgeon is not going to do brain surgery. \n\nEdit: corrected surgeon terms",
            "I know my frequent surgeries off by heart, but if I don\u2019t do it regularly I will definitely review either journal articles or text books, or ask an experienced colleague to assist me.\n\nI\u2019m a vet, but I assume it\u2019s similar in human medicine.",
            "Surgery resident with several years under my belt here, so hoping to offer a firsthand perspective for how we actually learn to \u201cdo surgery\u201d.\n\nThe basis of surgery is a good standing of the human anatomy.  Once you know the anatomy inside and out, surgeries are a matter of navigating through the various body structures to accomplish whatever needed to be done.  To that end, assisting and then actually doing the surgery semi-independently during our residency all reinforce good practice, muscle memory, and how to avoid potential pitfalls.   A minimum of 700-800 surgeries needed to be logged prior to graduation, of which there are specific numbers you need to reach for each organ system. (Ie. 50+ colorectal, 100so vascular, 10-20 hepatobiliary...etc etc). \n\nNow naturally there will be surgeries you may not see frequently by virtue of your area of training.  A general surgeon practicing in your typical community hospital who might be a pure badass at taking our an appendix may be lucky to do even just 1 Whipple\u2019s Procedure, an incredibly complicated surgery, during a year.  Nothing prevents him from doing the surgery: he \u201cknows\u201d on a theoretical basis what needed to be done and how to get there, and in a pinch can probably do it.  But the patient is probably better served going to an academic hospital where the surgeons may do 20-30 of them yearly.  There are studies that show the same results: centers that perform over 30+ of these surgeries tend to have better outcomes for their patient.  In these cases, these patients would probably be referred to a surgeon more specialized with more knowledge.  \n\nSo in conclusion: residency training require good theoretical and anatomical understanding for plenty of surgery.  A surgeon \u201cknows\u201d how to get there but may not have enough experience to avoid all the pitfalls of a surgery.  ",
            "Like the author of the top comment, I am also an anesthesiologist. one of the scariest things that I have seen in my career is a surgeon looking at a book trying to figure out how to do a surgery in the middle of the case. \n\nOne time, after messing around for 3 hours in a surgery that should have taken 15 minutes, I very gently asked the surgeon if perhaps I could call one of my friends to assist him. \n\nHe declined, and I ended up needing to call the chief of surgery to get him officially relieved from the surgery.",
            "I\u2019m a veterinarian and spays and neuters are a dime a dozen. BUT, if I\u2019ve got a specialty surgery I do\nMaybe 2-3 times a year I\u2019m definitely consulting the literature, and YouTube! Surprisingly you can find a video of almost any orthopedic or soft tissue surgery done in veterinary medicine online done by board certified specialists. Always helps to see someone else do it before I get in there and tackle it myself.",
            "Last year my hospital IT put up a new web filter. It blocked all entertainment and recreation sites from hospital computers.\n\nIn less than 24 hours they were forced to unblock YouTube. So many doctors use it to review surgeries and procedures every single day, they were threatened with a mass exodus if they tried to keep it blocked. ",
            "I\u2019m not a surgeon. However I had the honor to work under one while I was a combat medic in the US Army. \n\nHe had me do minor ones that he didnt want to bother doing due to them being minor. Like ingrown toe-nail removals and removing shrapnel fragments from patients. \n\nFor me, those were a big deal. And prior to a surgery I would go over the anatomy and videos on how to do them. \n\nHe did other things that I got to assist with. Like ligament or tendon reconstruction. Those were routine for him and he would easily do them without brushing up. ",
            "On a related note- listen to the 'Doctor Death' podcast.  It tells the story, in six parts, of the neurosurgeon Dr Christopher Duntsch and the ***33*** people he maimed or killed because this graduate of a top neurosurgery program (University of Tennessee) was incompetent/undertrained and a severe drug addict (mostly cocaine).  \n\nLearning to do surgery is normally a process of apprenticeship.  You watch a bunch.  Assist a bunch.  Perform under supervision a bunch and you're trained.  Normally a new doctor would have been some part of one thousand surgeries in his training.  Dr Christopher Duntsch (now serving a life sentence in Texas for his actions- he has been tried and convicted in a court of law, which is why I use his proper name with impunity) only participated in one hundred.  He simply did not know what he was doing in an operating room.  The effects of his severe cocaine use and his own mental issues blinded him to his utter incompetence, even after he managed to make his best friend a quadriplegic in a simple operation.\n\n",
            "Perfect question for me to answer, but it\u2019ll likely be buried at this point:\n\nI work for a medical device company who\u2019s speciality is Orthopedics. To keep this answer short, yes surgeons will often \u201cbrush up\u201d on certain procedures they don\u2019t do very often. Some ways to do that are watch videos on the procedure, read studies on the procedure, read literature from companies like mine on the products used in the procedure and also practicing on cadavers in a lab. \n\nI love what I do and would be more than happy to answer anyone\u2019s questions about this topic!",

General surgery is even considered to be more brutal than some direct pathway surgical specializations. \n\nGen Surg (w/o specialization or fellowship) is usually a 5 year training program (can be more if doing research) and they work insane hours and see a huge amount of surgical cases throughout their residency. A well-trained surgeon would not need to brush up on their skills, or look at YT or any of that (besides UptoDate or a surgical medical website) unless there are atypical factors and/or if it's a procedure they haven't done in a while, and usually will consult with other surgeons for that matter. \nFor atypical cases, most would just refer out to a surgeon trained specifically for that procedure. For rare cases, multiple consults are usually done, and even then if a surgeon doesn't feel comfortable operating, they can just refer out.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm just a 2nd year med student but I have a huge interest in surgery and have shadowed ~50 surgeries in my university teaching hospital in different fields since starting med school",

They are able to provide training, feedback, and troubleshooting for the procedure. They see the same surgery over and over again, so while they may not be scrubbed in or touch the patient, they can give valuable feedback to the doctor.",

Then come the uncommon cases, which we have done before however usually require some advanced planning or modification of an existing routine.  Occasionally you get cases which call for a creative approach.  When that happens we can consult publications, other surgeons, or device manufacturers (if a special device is needed).  It\u2019s a very thoughtful approach, since failure is not really an option. So the answer is 75% of the time no additional prep is needed, 20% of the time some kind of adjustment or modification has to be planned out, and 5% of the time you need to get creative and draw upon additional resources.",

            "Currently a surgery resident. We learn during residency the steps for all the surgeries we scrub in on by reading about them and watching videos beforehand. Hopefully, after 5 or so years of training, we have done common surgeries many times and know the steps, at least. Most of what we have to focus on is anatomy, but there are anatomic varieties from person to person. And there can be things we don't expect. You develop techniques that can he applied in multiple situations and sometimes, surgeons have to fly by the seat of their pants but have developed the skills to know how to do so safely. But, even after 5 years of training, in order to reliably perform complicated procedures (Whipple, etc.), further training in a specialty is usually required. It is not uncommon for surgeons to consult another surgeon of a different specialty intraoperatively (e.g. a trauma surgeon consulting a vascular surgeon during an emergency surgery for gunshot wound because an injury to a major blood vessel has been encountered during the procedure).\n\nTL;DR: As residents, we review before a case, but the attendings we scrub with know what they are doing without having to review or who to call if there's something they are not familiar enough with.",

If you aren\u2019t confident in what not to do, you ask for help.

We thought that was it for him but we managed to create a makeshift pulley.   We slung a rope over another branch with a laundry basket tied to the other end.  He actually got into the basket and we lowered him down.  He hasn\u2019t gone back up the tree since! \n\nIf you go the rope route, we made a throw line.  You can google it for more info.  Basically a small weighted bag at the end of a thin nylon like rope (cost about $6) and after many tries got it to the branch we needed.  \n\nI hope your cutie makes it down ok.  \n\nIT IS A MYTH that cats will just get hungry enough and climb down.  Unless they specifically know how to climb down backwards, he likely won\u2019t do it.  People will say things like \u201chave you ever seen a dead cat in a tree? No.\u201d Because when cats die in trees they usually fall like any deceased body would.  Cats die in trees all the time.",

            "It sounds a lot like you're describing something called \"Imposter Syndrome.\" Don't worry, it's not an actual disease; it's just the feeling that you describe where you feel inadequate despite evidence to the contrary. In graduate school, I hear this brought up a lot. Even though these students are academically bright and have made it into a master's or PhD program, they still feel like they don't belong and like everyone else is better than they are.\n\nOf course, it carries beyond schooling. People may get the feeling they don't belong for one reason or another in the workplace, in a club, or maybe even in a family gathering. It happens to everyone, and it's natural.\n\nA few things that may help. \n\n1) everyone is faking it til they make it. Hopefully, they know a few things, but a lot of people are just taking life as it comes and doing the best they can. Sometimes that best effort looks like they know something more.\n\n2) it's ok to admit when you don't know something. It's how we learn and how we grow. Most people would rather be around someone who asks questions to understand things rather than someone that thinks they know it all. Like the Kansas lyrics, \"And if I claim to be a wise man, it surely means that I don't know.\" Truly wise people can recognize their own limitations and admit when they don't know.\n\n3) intelligence isn't just a number. In fact, most IQ tests are a horrible way to measure how smart someone is because most people agree that there are different types of intelligence. You can be really good with mathematics, with creative endeavors, or with athletics; all constitute a different type of intelligence. So while you may be \"dumb\" in one way or another, you probably excel in other areas.\n\nSo in closing and in the wise words of ancient philosopher Hannah Montana, \"everyone has those days... Everyone gets that way... Nobody's perfect\" (my sister got Disney+, ok? Don't judge me.). At times, imposter syndrome rears its head to make you feel inadequate, but it helps me to remember what I said above.\n\nHere's a link on imposter syndrome if you'd like to read more: https://hbr.org/2008/05/overcoming-imposter-syndrome",
            "You gotta watch out for \"confirmation bias,\" where you only notice things that confirm your belief. It happens all the time, to EVERYONE. You are very likely only paying attention to the times when someone makes you feel stupid. \n\nHere's the trick: Stop paying attention to the feeling of feeling stupid. Pay attention to what they are saying. Try to learn from it. Use the Google to see if they are bullshitting you (but never challenge them, just keep it to yourself). Now you know more! Even if they were bullshitting you, now you know the real scoop AND that some people believe this bullshit for some reason.\n\nWith every interaction YOU WILL LEARN MORE.\n\n\nSource: 99% of all people are stupider than me. Multiple tests confirm that. But that doesn't mean I know more. The most important thing I do know is that others are gonna know more than me on lots of stuff. My job is to find the stuff they know, that I don't, and get them taking about that. It makes them feel better, and I learn even more.",

Maybe \"forget\" isn't *quite* an accurate term.\n\nIt was more like I'd be singularly focused on something I was doing, to the exclusion of all else (hyperfocus, it's an ADHD thing), and I either wouldn't notice I was tired (or hungry, or needed a restroom break, or that several hours had passed, etc.) or if I *did* notice any of those things, my mind just sort of pushed it back and filtered it out of my awareness because, in that moment, what I was hyper-fixated on was the most important, most urgent thing in the world for me.  If I was hungry, I either didn't notice it or if I did, stopping what I was doing to go eat was too much of a bother; it could wait.  If I was tired, I either didn't notice or if I did, I just needed to \"get to a good stopping point\" (plot twist: there's *never* a good stopping point, that goal post has a pair of jet engines strapped to it) before I go to sleep.  And it just so happened that the middle of the night and the wee hours of the morning **also** meant fewer disruptions from other people in the house.  So it's more like my ADHD was compelling me to be reflexively willfully ignorant of how tired I was (among other personal needs) when I noticed it, and blocking out awareness most other times in the first place.",

I work in fraud for a credit union and it is way too common for people to answer those trends or challenges when you are actually answering possible challenge questions or password questions asked for security reasons! \n\nFor me I don't answer the questions truthfully. No one is ever going to say ma'am the street you grew up on was not MACARONI. However I chose one random word and that is what I use for every. Single. Security. Question. \n\nNo one else will be able to guess it to get past those questions and it's super easy for me to remember one word for everything.",

It's difficult for me to say with total confidence that no meme in history has ever been created for this purpose, but it strikes me as unlikely.  \n\nAlthough there is definitely some overlap between the memes and the security questions as pointed out, identity theft is typically the result of a data breach, not someone deliberately researching you to figure out what street you grew up on. \n\nBasically, someone hacks Target.com and gets the login credentials for a million users. Then a program uses those same credentials on other high value sites until they get hits. \n\nThere generally are not anonymous people on the internet that are putting in the time to actively research any one individual. The likelihood that they are able to use logic and research to actually figure out your credentials, AND that those credentials actually lead to anything valuable are pretty low. \n\nCompare that strategy to the one where you get millions of credentials, each of which are potentially valid entries for hundreds of sites without having to do any direct research of any kind, and you can see why facebook memes are not an efficient route to identity theft.\n\nProtect yourself by using unique, randomly generated passwords for all your log-ins, and 2FA where possible.",

This is the ts ts ts phase.\n\nWhen it reaches the end of its arc, a lever on the back side gets flipped.  This lever is in the way of the metal arm, which now hits this lever instead of the force getting absorbed by the spring.  Since it's on the other side of the sprinkler, it turns the sprinkler the other way.

In the neck, you'll be just as dead as anyone else.\n\nA few decades ago someone tried to stab Al Sharpton to death and he basically survived with minor injuries.  The attempted murderer stabbed him many times in the abdomen and Sharpton was so fat that none of the stabs touched anything vital.  He basically went to the hospital, got some stitches, and was sent home with a clean bill of health.",

            "Fun story time. In my late twenties I got my back slashed open. About four or five inch incision, down to the meat. It looked like a nice steak at the bottom of the cut, just bright red muscle. The doc couldn't suture the wound. He said normally they sew the fat together but not the skin because the skin on your back stretches too much and it tends to rip out stitches. I was a fucking bean pole at the time and didn't have enough subcutaneous fat to sew together. Instead they packed the wound and my wife had to unpack and clean it twice a day until it filled in with scar tissue. If I was chubbier they would have been able to close it and all the wound care wouldn't have been necessary which dramatically lowers infection risk, but I wouldn't have my badass scar either. So yeah, sometimes a little extra padding is useful at least for after the knife fight although that's not how I got cut.",

So maybe technically you\u2019d be able to survive a specific knife would to the body better, but if you\u2019re going to live your life being just that fat is it really a win? If the person stabbing really wants you dead then they\u2019d probably just keep stabbing you all over and there\u2019s nothing making that person start by stabbing at guts so\u2026 yeah",
            "Yes actually, Roman gladiators ate fatty diets to give them an extra layer of fat for just that reason. However, if you are overweight, you have a strong chance of dying from other things besides knife wounds.",
            "You've already gotten a lot of good answers, but I wanted to add that you should absolutely continue your diet unless you have multiple people who are intent on stabbing you on a regular basis.  Obesity kills people at much faster rates than blade violence.  So, if you're bouncing clubs in London, maybe stay bulky.\n\nThat being said, if you're too fat to run away from a knife, that's a far worse situation.",
            "No. Lean muscle is by design tougher and more dense. Fat -while larger in volume- isn't as dense, and thus would be easier to pierce.  Muscle being harder to cut though means a slightly smaller wound -assuming the same amount of force exerted of course. Naturally, smaller wound means less blood loss... but still really sucks and you'll need Medical care either way- you're still not knifeproof lol.\n\nNot to mention, should one become notably overweight, at a certain point it makes it harder for doctors to repair the wound due to having to push more out of the way to attend to vitals/organs should that come to damage.\n\nHowever, an argument can be made that an overweight person may require a slightly larger blade to be taken down -quickly-, since it would need to go in deeper for a sudden end to occur. But like, that's beyond me to say definitively. And again, medical care is still mandatory.",

            "Are you planning to get stabbed?\nAlso best way to survive a knife is not being stabbed eg running the fuk away",
            "Yes, I think so, to some extent, of course.  You'd be less likely to sustain as serious an injury to the torso, especially from a short blade, but it does depend on the knife, the location of the wound, etc.  That's true of gunshot wounds from most handguns as well.  I don't think the possible benefits are hige and significant enough to really be a benefit. \n\nHowever, obesity complicates EVERY other aspect of your care.  A lesser wound might be more dangerous for you than for a fit person, if bleeding isn't catastrophic. \n\nPost-survival outcomes will be worse; things like complications from anesthesia, complications from intubation like pneumonia and pneumothorax are more likely,  regain of function at the site long-term would be diminished, the quality of surgical outcomes is worse, overal mobility/activity will be negatively affected reducing activity.  Physical therapy will be less effective. Likelihood of post-traumatic and post-surgical infections increases. \n\n Amputation due to ischemia if injured in an extremity is more likely.  Diffuse intravascular coagulopathy could be a bigger and more likely develoment, leading to organ damage and amputations at the extremities. Cardiac or kidney ischemia are more likely.  \n\nIf you became paralyzed you'd have a lot more chronic issues that would likely shorten your life.\n\nStuff like that.  \n\nThe deal with stabbings is that they tend to be terrifyingly deadly, or no big deal.  I've seen a young kid \"stabbed\" 14 times and only need stitches.",
            "Trauma nurse here. Absolutely. Depending on stab wound location, but yes I can't count how many overweight stab victims I've taken care of who have avoided injury to major organs and vessels due to their \"cushioning\". \nCardiac disease, diabetes, and high cholesterol kill exponentially more people annually than trauma. Those increase your risk for heart attack, stroke, kidney failure, and other preventable illnesses. Go on your diet.",

            "In theory, yes. There is chance a knife would be just a few mm to short to reach your liver due to all the fat you have, the more the better I guess.\n\nJust like in surgery you sometimes need longer instruments for fat people.",

Meaning if you get stabbed, you'll bleed out quicker than most.\n\nAdditionally, being fat makes you less handleable. The first responders that come to help you will probably need extra assistance getting you into the ambulance, and slows things down a lot. Combining that with the high blood pressure makes a dangerous combo.\n\nLastly, there's of course the other health issues that come with being obese.

So yes, fat does have the potential to offer some protection.\n\nBut all that said, the average person probably doesn't live with much risk of knife wounds and your current health vis a vis diet / exercise / lifestyle should probably be the primary driver for these decisions. \n\nNot only that, but knife wounds have a fairly high survival rate compared to e.g. gunshot wounds.",

But that's about as slow as they go. It has to do with their aerodynamics. Their wing size compared to their body mass makes hovering or moving at slow speeds very tiring, so it's more physically feasible to constantly go at fast speeds.",

            "I believe its mainly because the function of lol has shifted from its literal meaning, while wtf and idk are still mainly shortened to save time/typing effort and have mostly retained their literal meaning .\n\nEveryone probably know by now that lol rarely actuall means that the person is actually laughing. What people actually mean when they use lol is rather difficult to determine at this point. Based on her research, linguist Michelle McSweeney has classified lol as an *irony marker*, so it is used to alert the reader to an extra layer of meaning in a message. \n\nExamples of what people want to actually convey through lol are [flirting, softening the tone of the message, or asking for sympathy](https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/8/2/20750773/because-internet-review-gretchen-mcculloch-linguistics). In none of those functions, the literal meaning of 'lauging out loud' would make any sense. So, it is pretty logical that are brains have collectively stopped 'translating' lol in this way. If you like, you can learn more about the shifting meaning of lol in the linked article or in Gretchen McCulloch's fascinating book 'Because Internet'.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut maybe, that is a touch too nerdy for you, which would also be completely understandable. So **TL;DR**: idk in most cases literally means 'I don't know'  and the same is true for wtf. lol, on the other hand has shifted its meaning. These days, it functions similarly to something like a question mark or an emoji.

I give you two imaginary words, guess which sounds more like it could be a potential word in English: Spilring vs. Chzonp\n\nIf you are a near native speaker of English, you will say that spilring is more likely an English word than chzonp. And your intuition is based on the knowledge that you have not seen words in English that have chz in the beginning and np at end, but many words have sp in the beginning and ng at the end. This tacit knowledge is called phonotactics. You can test your phonotactics further with words Mbroky, Minstel, klen, tvyory, etc. \n\nLol can pass off as a possible complete word in the English language, because it follows the phonotactics of the English language well.

            "My brain doesn't translate \"idk\" into words. I just think \"eye dee kay\". lol. idk",
            "I would guess the presence of a vowel in \"lol\" suggests to the brain that it is a word and not just a string of consonants.",

            "Well for me, it actually is a word. Lol means fun in dutch.",
            "Lots of luck!",
            "I think it's because you can pronounce lol like a word instead of reading it as \"el oe el\" like you do with the others\n\n\"Lol\" is 1 syllable while \"laughing out loud\" is 4, so it's much quicker to just accept it as a word and move on\n\nAlso, the opposite is true for wtf because w had a shitty name (that has an interesting history, but really doesn't fit. It's like a nerd, in letter form)",
            "In Dutch \"lol\" is a word with a very similar meaning (fun, enjoyment), which is why I never translate it. I wonder if the Dutch word had any influence on the development of the English word/acronym.",
            "Because our brain is one lazy ass bitch. It doesn't want to work out for \"lol\" into \"laugh out loud\". WTF and IDK takes less than a sec to pronounce in our head.",

            "Because what the fuck are words you say together and it\u2019s used how it\u2019s defined shorter, and laugh out loud is not used like that when you expand it, it\u2019s just representing a laugh so we think of it as \u201cthat thing\u201d that means a laugh while wtf we think of as, what.the.fuck.\nDuh",

            "Cause lol is laugh out loud, you don\u2019t say laugh at loud, you just laugh out loud",
            "because \"lol\" is pronounced like it is read while \"wtf\" and \"idk\" are pronounced by reading out the letters",

            "idk my bff Jill.",
            "Because nobody really says \"double-u tee eff\" or \"I dee Kay\", when spoken we always say the full words because it's easier to pronounce.\n\nBut for lol, it's way faster and easier to just say \"lol\" than \"laughing out loud\" so we probably associate it more easily. Or rather, \"lol\" became its own word whereas \"wtf\" / \"idk\" are still just abbreviations.",

            "Bc lol is a proper word for saying out loud but you can't say wtf without going 'double u ti ef'. Things are actually different for me, bc in Polish you can say 'wtf' as a word and I often see it as one without translating.",

            "One is acronym whereas others are abbreviations .",
            "Well in Dutch, 'lol' actually means 'fun', so I've never really read it as 'laughing out loud', but rather as meaning something like 'that's funny', which kinda fits the use of 'lol' better than its original meaning 'laughing out loud'",
