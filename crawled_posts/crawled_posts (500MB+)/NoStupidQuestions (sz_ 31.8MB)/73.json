We love each other very much, but we cant stand each other and we have quite the personality and personal issues. Yet, I have no resources skills (and all that \"depress me\" which makes it even harder) and such to leave and they do need my help no matter how tiny it is (maybe now not as much as before) which lead me to reject jobs (bad jobs, but jobs anyway).

Show you are the bigger person, show you are capable, show you dont really need them but CHOOSE them, talk to them about it calmly and make them understand you are communicating something, not asking if you are right (so, make them take you seriously, although it might not happen) and if you can, get a job and live by yourself, leaving always if you can in GOOD terms, as you might need them, or regret your choices; If you are a kid things are a bit different but, again always trying to see the situation from the outside, with less personal bias, try to guarantee you get \"a way out\", be it money, skills education friends, whatever.\n\nHope it was helpful",

It's almost like you can read people's minds. And one day you'll find that your parents are perfectly transparent, and you can predict quite accurately everything they say and do. \n\nAnd it will drive them crazy.\n\nAnyway, do keep records, remember you're not the one who is crazy, and don't bait them or give them any excuse.

If you think about it, if I were to go kill a little kid or something, and my parents locked me out and said they wouldn't let me in unless I confessed to the police, that wouldn't be abuse. That would be giving me an option where I won't be abused.\n\nSo in your case, yes you might be being abused, just the same as I am, but we both have a choice where even if we don't like it, there is an option where we can be treated right.\n\nAbuse is, for example, keeping you're kid from ever leaving the house and beating them, and there's no way the kid can act to make them stop. \n\nAlso, just try not to ever get into an argument with you're parents about anything. If you have such strong beliefs at you're age, just imagine how strong theirs have become...\n\nIf you aren't enjoying you're parents, make a plan to run away.

The other part is the social and emotional aspects, and they aren\u2019t providing you with a supportive, nurturing environment. \n\nYour family probably doesn\u2019t see it as abuse because they don\u2019t want to see the parents as abusive.",

            "Hey /u/pancakefroggy \\- as everyone has said, this is some abusive stuff. I also come from an abusive household, and it took years and years and years of processing - I had to move several thousand miles away just to get out from under the thumb of the abuse (even as an adult), and now even more years later - I've fully cut contact, blocked all the numbers and changed addresses ALL because it never stopped, and kept manifesting in new ways as I closed holes that the abuse could come through. Your experiences resonate with some of my own - my parent fought to control me even as I was fully a independent adult. The padlocks on the doors you have now may very well turn into something else even if you move out.   \n\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that, don't be like me and let it get too bad before some serious irreparable damage is done (to you, specifically). And seek help for your situation, CPS is probably a good start because it sounds like you're underage. My parental unit is, as far as I'm concerned, irredeemable. But maybe there's hope for yours. I hope there is.  \n\n\nSecondly: family is important, but what is \\*far more\\* important is yourself. You should be your number one priority. If your family cannot/will not be the source of love/care/support that you need - they. and I cannot stress this enough, DO NOT need to be part of your life. I know that sounds scary and pessimistic, but to quote a meme I saw recently: \"heal before having children so your children don't have to heal from having you as a parent\" - which fully applies to people like you and me. In my situation, I could not heal with them still in my life because they refused to change - so again, I hope there is room for yours to change so you CAN heal - but know that it's ok to love your family and remove them from your life. And trust me, it sucks having to explain to a coworker who asks what you did for mothers day was 'nothing', because you cant summarize 3 decades of abuse in a sentence - but being mentally healthy is worth that awkward conversation  \n\n\nLastly; I'm no expert - but if you need someone to talk too - my inbox is open.",
            "Idk I feel like being Latino I grew up kind of similar I would say not abuse, how old are you? \n\nSome parents are more strict than others and getting hit and yelled at was the thing in the 90s lol but idk that\u2019s just me take it with a grain of salt. \n\nYou can\u2019t always have everything you want. They just sound strict parents that\u2019s all",
            "> I\u2019m not allowed to lock doors, but my parents have padlocks on the door so I don\u2019t leave the house without them.\n\nyes",
            "I am sorry the three of you are going through this and I assure you, you are not being ridiculous.\nHonestly I wish I could help you more. I don't care if your parents are mentally ill, they are the adults - they have to be responsible and get help if they are too overwhelmed of taking care of you the right way.\nIf they don't, they won't change. \n\n\nGetting spanked for puking could only make the puking worse, because feeling nauseous and vomiting can be a symptom of anxiety caused by getting hurt over something one has no control over (especially at that age).\nSpanking isn't something to use to discipline a child, it's violence. The yelling is verbal violence. And invalidating your emotions when you need to cry does more harm than people like to admit because of other people playing the drama card.\n\n\nAfter typing all this, I feel like your parents don't know how to process/deal/cope with their own childhoods and need to let it out on their own children. I know people like them like to justify the spanking with \"I got spanked as a child and I turned out okay\" but they didn't, otherwise they wouldn't act this way.\nThey need help. But you have to put yourself first and I hope you can open up to your therapist for real.",

            "I literally saw someone get bullied off one of the trauma subs by a single person, the OP and the bully were the only two people in the thread and by the time I saw it OP had deleted their account. Reported the bully and it went nowhere. I hate things sometimes",
            "Some people can be really shitty on here. I saw a poster once expressing genuine distress and asking on an ADVICE subreddit because she was not satisfied by her bf of 8 months and had feelings for someone else. People ripped into her for no reason and she deleted her post and account. Idk why we can't just be nice and understand everyone else's feelings. She wanted advice. Never got it. I was one of the first commenters and I got several down votes for attempting to validate her feelings. So damn right I upvote people who don't deserve downvotes",
            "Yes. If I consider comment's value to be neutral or better, I tend to upvote if it's below +1. And I'm lazy voter in general, I just know it's annoying to get downvoted for no good reason.",
            "Reddit definitely feels like a pile-on to me.\nI often see posts that are sarcastic or misunderstood, and will get initial downvotes, and even after editing or correcting, people will just pile it on even more.\nI also see the opposite, where early in a news story or based on false info a redditor will make some excellent sounding but incorrect assertion and then get tons of upvotes but once it comes out they are wrong, it sticks to the top.\n\nAs an aside, reddit can be a very harsh place. A ton of subreddits are devoted to being anti-something, and they will go out of their way to find the most random uneducated opinion and then imply that is the informed opinion of their opposition and then group-shit on it. Political subs are especially bad for this. Just find some random kid on Twitter with a dumb ass opinion, title it \"See?? This is what THEY all believe!!\" and then pile on it.",
            "Saw someone asking for electrical help yesterday - they didn't understand the problem well enough to ask the right questions or give details the commenters wanted. Everybody starts somewhere, but all the OP's responses were downvoted to hell.\n\nI checked out their profile, and that person is just trying to do their best with what they have. Hurt to see it.",
            "I obviously have misunderstood Reddiquette.  I always thought it was the done thing to upvote something you replied to, if you agreed with or if it made you smile or think.  I thought it was bad form to downvote an opinion if it was honestly held.  Personally I only ever downvote rudeness.\n\nI do upvote unjustified downvotes and I hate the Reddit downvote bandwagon where people just assume a few downvotes means they have to add theirs.",
            "Yeah, sometimes. I just gave everyone so far an upvote.",
            "I've done it a few times when the downvote was clearly not deserved. But I don't feel crappy even for a second when I get downvoted. I don't expect everyone to agree with me, and I generally believe I have to say what I believe is true.\n\nThere are some subs, though, where I don't even bother. Any comment that goes against the narrative is going to get downvoted into oblivion. Like minded people gather in those subs to pat each other on the back and reassure each other that they are right. I realize that not posting just reenforces their impression that nobody disagrees with them, but one person screaming into the wind isn't going to be heard, and if several people try to do it then they'll all be accused by the mods of \"brigading\", and get banned. These people *REALLY* don't want to hear any opposing opinions, and they'll happily silence anyone who tries.",

I think some people just downvote for the hell of it. Even if I don't actually agree with the person BUT they're reasonable I'll still upvote them for expressing themselves in a respectable manner.",

I really wish people would be more active about upvoting good posts and such. This puts them higher up on the page. \n\nI also wish mods would stop deleting posts that offer value/insight/positivity/fun simply because it breaks a rule... I recently had a post go crazy, by my standards. I posted late in the night and when I woke up it was at 1.9m views and 40k upvotes. It was then deleted because of a technicality in the rules. It was an example of a lizard being a bro to humans and the sub was specifically for animals being bros to other animals. A lot of people joined in on the discussion and we had a lot of fun talking about the different names people gave these reptilian helpers...but then boom, it was taken down and I couldn't even go back in to read the replies...",

Sometimes, a 0 is actually a 1.\n\nThis being said, it annoys me when people are downvoted for asking an honest question or for contributing a reasonable comment to a discussion. Depends on the sub, but in many cases, it's just one person or a minority of community members who are doing the all downvoting, but few people are upvoting everything, so some comments get stuck with a 0.",

Not really to make the person feel better but rather because a comment that isnt at 1 upvote is a lot more likely to get downvoted by others simply because it was already downvoted. Redditors rarely think for themselves and are quick to follow trends based on first impressions like that so Id rather keep it \u201cneutral\u201d.",

I got a lot of negative feedback and downvotes, and literally every single reply called me a bad owner and told me to surrender my dog and that she would be better off elsewhere.

No woman I know has ever wanted an unsolicited dick pic.  Honestly not sure what guys are trying to do there (impress us??? more like the exact the opposite!,lol!

Along with other forms of harassment and assault, it looks like there\u2019s a degree of blaming the victim and assuming that creeps will always be creeps, and all someone can do is try to protect themselves (I guess by... not existing as a woman in public?)\n\nI think it\u2019s a huge violation of normal human decency to send nude pictures without receiving consent, ESPECIALLY when it happens with strangers and to young people, and I agree it should definitely be shamed.",

And this generally applies to other ethnic cuisines in the US, whether that's Italian or Japanese or Indian. \n\nFirst, local tastes are important to cater too. When Chinese families began emigrating en mass to North America, they didn't find a culinary culture like we have today, where varied and strange new flavors are *sought* after. So they had to adapt to serving what locals would enjoy. That meant paring a lot of recipes down and removing the very uniquely Chinese peppers and spices, and avoiding the kinds of animals and plants not found in North America. \n\nSecond, they just didn't have access to the ingredients necessary for making traditional Chinese food. Without the unique ingredients used at home, it would be impossible to truly replicate authentic Chinese food. \n\nSo they innovated and created what we know see as American Chinese food. Which is still just as valuable and good as the traditional variety, it was just born out of a different situation.",
            "A big part of it is due to the Chinese Exclusion Act, lots of Chinese people were being deported but business owners were more or less exempt. Since then there's been a very strong entrepreneurial tradition amongst chinese Americans. American Chinese Food itself originally developed because curious Americans were checking out Chinese restaurants more and more, causing many establishments to start catering to this demographic by mixing chinese spices and ingredients with less exotic ones, like prioritizing chicken over duck. Over time it became it's own seperate form of cuisine. \nNot all chinese food businesses are owned by Chinese families, but most are mostly due to chinese families successfully running resturaraunts like that for over a century. It's a good business model. \n\nI explained it poorly.",

            "U need to know that China is a very big country with 23 provinces. Each province has its own culture and it's own food and they can be vastly different. It is not possible to represent the entire suite of \"authentic\" Chinese cuisine in a single restaurant. It's like saying u opened an \"Caucasian food restaurant\" somewhere in South America and u try to serve food from Italy, France, America, Canada etc\" and try to fit it within a menu that your chef can dish out in any day.  \n\nSecondly, any kind Chinese food outside China is \"localized\". Actually most food not from the country is localized (e.g. Tex-Mex)\n\nThey need to adapt the taste to local tastes so people in that country would want to visit their restaurant. So they do this for business. I am from Singapore and I sometimes visit Chinese restaurants  when I go on vacation. Many times, the server explained that the food might taste different tham that I expect cos it's \"localized\" and sometimes, they will offer to tune the food I ordered to suit \"Chinese taste\". \n\nOn why Chinese families own Chinese restaurant, it is almost the same for every culture. It is easier to cook your own food, and then adapt it to local tastes.",
            "Most American Chinese cuisine that people know is modified from Cantonese cuisine, and specifically altered to cater for the locals, which is also why American Chinese is different from British Chinese or Australian Chinese food, etc.\n\nFor a long time 'Chinese cuisine' was just Cantonese food as most immigration was from that region. Only recently have cuisines from other regions of China (most notably Shanghai, Sichuan/Chongqing) gotten popular overseas.",
            "It's worth noting that there is a range of authenticity of the dishes in these sterotypical American Chinese Joints. Most of the dishes that are meat and veggies in a sauce with a side of rice are at least based in something authentic, though perhaps not exactly what you would get in China. The ingredients are usually better, the flavors more vibrant, and less MSG. I highly recommend Chinatown Express in DC if you are looking to try something more authentic. Orient Express in Baltimore is great too, though they are a Szechuan place, so the flavor profile and dishes are a bit different.",

            "\"Chinese food\" would be better put as \"Chinese immigrant food\". It got its roots from Stir Fry brought over from Chinese immigrants in the early 1900s. American Chinese food is arguably one of the most American foods out there with very little of it based on traditional Chinese cooking. Chinese immigrants have been slinging that stuff for a hundred years.\n\nWhere I'm from in MA they have Greek immigrant owned pizza/roast beef shops that aren't reflective of Mediterranean culture but are very reflective of Greek immigrant in Massachusetts culture.",
            "Because they know how to make Chinese food... and they live in America so they change the food to cater to their largest demographic of customers who are American.\n\nThat's like asking why McDonald's in Korea have mostly Korean workers and not American.",
            "Because most were still started with by Chinese immigrants who used Chinese influences in their food, but they also Americanized it to be able to sell it to the most people.",
            "Immigrant restaurants were historically built by immigrants who were doing their best to copy recipes from their home country, from memory, and despite not having access to all of the same resources as they would have originally.\n\nFor example, wasabi is made from Japanese horseradish, which only grows in Japan. So if you were a Japanese immigrant, you would have probably had to find a substitute for wasabi in any dishes you made in the U.S. \n\nYou would also have a completely different set of ingredients to experiment with in America than you would in your old country - ingredients like sugar that might have been extremely expensive in your home country but was relatively affordable in the U.S. \n\nAlso, immigrants aren't a monolith - a lot of immigrants coming to the U.S. were doing so because they were poor or oppressed in their own home countries. So \"Italian-American\" food wasn't really created by \"Italians\", it was specifically created by \"Southern Italians\", who used ingredients and cooking methods that their more famous northern countrymen might not have used. Southern Italians used more seafood and tomatoes in their dishes than northern Italians did, for example. So \"Italian-American\" food isn't going to look much like classic \"Italian\" food in the first place because northern Italy holds a lot of sway over what the rest of the world would consider \"classic Italian food\". \n\nLastly, you have to cook for your customers. If dog meat is a customary ingredient in your home country's signature dish, but Americans don't eat dog meat, you have to find a substitute that's more appealing to them.",

One of the ways they would help new immigrants would be to assist them with starting a restaurant: giving them loans, training, finding locations that weren't competing with each other...and especially, giving them a set of recipes that had been proven to sell well to American tastes, using common American ingredients. This was almost like a franchise system, except there wasn't any single \"brand\" tying these restaurants together.\n\nSo while \"Chinese food\" was Americanized in much the same way other ethnic cuisines were, the \"Chinese restaurant\" as an institution was deliberately copy-pasted by immigrant-aid organizations to provide new immigrant business-owners with their best chance at success.",

Also, a well meaning factual description will often be repeated (badly) to other kids and come back to the parent as a \"what are you telling my children\" moment. When the four year old tries to explain insemination to the six year old and the eight year old overhears and decides to tell mom that the neighbor kid is saying bad words - it's not a good day for any of us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf someone is still telling their twelve year old blah blah blah cabbage patch, then they're out of touch and shortchanging their kid of an appropriate and meaningful exchange, missing an opportunity to foster some interest in biology, and quite possibly putting the kid at risk of all the dangers related to poor sex-ed.",
            "There are many reasons. One is that sex is actually pretty complicated and kids don't really have the life experience or vocabulary to understand \"the truth,\" some of it is to protect kids from information they are too young to process, some of it has to do with sex taboos in society, and there are few more other things.\n\nOverall, I don't think it's a bad thing to get a slight sanitized version that is basically that a man puts his penis in a woman's vagina and nine months later a baby can come out. Little kids do not have penises and vaginas that function like those of adults and they won't totally get it, they also don't know much about biology, but this covers what is essentially the truth. \n\nIt really depends on the age of the kid. A 5-year-old can get the above version. Maybe 10 (I am sure there are people who know more accurately than I do) can get a little more about sex for pleasure and why it's important to do things like that with people you trust and it's OK not to do it if you don't want to, and nobody should ever force you to do it, even with just words. But you can see that the more accurately you talk about sex, the faster you get into some scary territory for your kids, so you want them on a \"need to know\" basis as they grow up.",

But I was uncomfortable giving her all the details.  I concentrated more on how the baby develops in utero thinking that would satisfy her curiosity and it did for a few years.  Eventually she started asking more questions and I just answered as scientifically as possible.  The Mom and Dad have to mix their DNA.  There is a egg inside you with half the DNA, etc. etc.  Now she has a pretty good scientific understanding.  I think emphasizing the science, even with knowledge of penetration, helps take away some of the weirdness.  We are just talking biology.  I'm also hoping that because she first learned penetration was for making babies that when she decides to do it for fun, she will remember the making baby part and use protection.",

To say the least they were never the most open or outwardly loving parents you can have but they love you- you can tell. \n\nAnyway, my mom got her first period when she was 10. She had absolutely no idea what was happening to her and freaked out because she thought she was bleeding out and dying. My grandmother explained it to her by handing her a pad and saying \u201coh it\u2019s just your period.\u201d No further explanation. When it came time for my sister and I to get our periods we were well prepared because my mother swore she would never let her daughters be so in the dark about something like that- ever.  She took the same approach with \u201cTHE talk\u201d. She\u2019s honestly the best mom ever- she made sure we always had open communication. ",
            "A few things.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Sex is a big taboo. For many people, it's still considered somehow bad or unclean or stuff like that. Children are supposed to be innocent. Telling them about something like that upsets people who have very prudish ideas about sex. Ruins the innocence, at least according to the more conservatively-minded.\n2. On the flipside, children react to things in a straightforward way. Children don't necessarily have the same biases and judgments that adults have, and often it's difficult to communicate those biases to someone who doesn't share those biases (yet?). Take someone who is homophobic. You've maybe heard the phrase \"how will I explain this to my kids?\" when anything related to same-sex couples is shown in the media, particularly children's media? The unspoken question that's really being asked is \"How will I explain to my kids that this is evil without sounding like a hypocrite?\". Sex in general is similar (even if the parents' biases are more benign than homophobia). Explaining sex means children will form their own ideas about it, whether their parents want it or not. Those ideas might not necessarily be what the parents WANT to be - because children take things at face value. This, to some parents, is upsetting enough to steer clear off the topic.\n3. Parents often fear their children will be too sexually active when they're teenagers. Some have the crazy idea that not understanding or knowing about sex will somehow prevent or delay that - that ignorance about sex existing at all will somehow shield the children from being interested in it. This is, of course, crazy (lack of knowledge about sex and education that emphasises abstinence or \"sinfulness\" leads to MORE irresponsible sex, including things like STDs and unplanned pregnancies in teenagers), but there absolutely are parents who think they can control and plan their children's entire lives by keeping them in the dark.\n4. Parents are uncomfortable about sex themselves and may not necessarily know that much about it, especially if they received poor sex education themselves (no, seriously, you'd be surprised how many misconception about sex and sex-related biology are present even among sexually active adults). Children are curious, so they will ask questions. Those questions will be uncomfortable, awkward and might bee a bit TOO inquisitive for the parents, who simply are not confident enough to answer in a way they deem satisfactory. So they play it safe and avoid the topic altogether, hoping that this somehow will never be an issue.",
            "I always figured the reason for being careful what you say to a kid is because there is a high chance the kid will repeat that info at school or in public in a way that others could think is inappropriate.\n\nI can easily imagine a teacher falsely coming to the conclusion that there is some abuse or bad parenting going on when a child repeats curse words or talks about sex.",
            "Maybe it's a bit too early and graphic for a child to hear all these descriptions about sex. They might not even understand. I wouldn't feel comfortable (if I had kids) explaining to them the process of sex at all, I think it would make them extremely uncomfortable. Even for me as a kid I would've been scared. I would not lie but say \" babies are made by a man and a woman. At one point a man has a seed that mixes up with a female cell in her belly. It takes 9 months for these cells to form a baby. \"  Or \"You'll lear about the subject of making babies at school in biology classes\". ",
            "I've never heard anyone actually make up a big dumb story. Most people just simplify it like you said. ",
            "I never lied about it but I have held out on having the talk longer than I would've liked. I have two kids, 7 and 4. I just finally had the talk with my daughter, the 7-year-old. Honestly, I was waiting until she brought it up to but it never really happened. We have had other semi-related discussions (like about periods) so I thought it would just eventually come up. So the other day, we were having a mommy-daughter day and she mentions how she heard me talking about babies and adoption (I was actually discussing the new NY abortion law with my husband, but I wasn't about to go into that with her). I saw that as my opportunity and asked her if she knew where babies come from and she said \"the stork\" because of the \"Storks\" movie that came out a couple of years ago. \\*face-palm\\* I realized that I've been doing her a HUGE disservice and finally explained to her how babies are made. \n\nI wish I had recorded the conversation but I was driving at the time. Her reaction was priceless. A look of horror, confusion, shock, disgust (maybe some dawning comprehension that now she knows what daddy and I did to make her) was plastered on her face and she asked \"Are we at the store yet???\" \n\nIt was a sort of an awkward conversation, (I even spoke about masturbation) but I'm glad I did it. She's old enough to know about that stuff and they've been having talks at school about unwanted physical touch, so I was able to pull that into the conversation, too. It's a shame -- a lot of kids are molested/sexually assaulted but don't know how to articulate it because that stuff was never explained to them. Obviously I hope beyond hope that never happens to my kid, but in the horrible, horrible chance that it could happen to her, she'll hopefully be able to articulate it.\n\n&#x200B;",
            ">When the truth is just science really.\n\nThe truth is it\u2019s a taboo topic for the faiths because of what they teach about sex, your origins, your body, etc.\n\nWhen you say \u201cit\u2019s just science\u201d. \nWelp...you\u2019re right, it\u2019s just biology! \nBut not every person of faith believes in biology, and certainly not every one of them agrees with science. As more and more people like yourself realize that it\u2019s not helpful to be indoctrinated and they step away from that indoctrination, these taboos will decrease and it will get easier to talk about where babies come from.",

She started explaining sex and the importance of protected sex when I was 11 or 12 and not even remotely interested.
