Mentions all her guy friends that have tried to hit on her and replies back after hours to me compared to when she wants to talk it's seconds. Idc she has male friends but she doesn't want to tell any of her friends she's dating. She also told me she has had a threesome and a high body count all males. I don't mind but I mentioned to her how I don't feel like a priority and that the body count threw me off cus I don't know how I would measure up. Instead of answering me at all she got mad about the body count. I told her I don't mind just I feel like a secret and her willing to drop me if I do or say anything makes it feel like I'm trying to much compared to her. She didn't address this either just is mad I reacted to the threesome news. Am I overthinking or are these red flags?\n\nQuick update: She didn't respond back to me at all and instead even though she was supposed to be busy fir her dad's birthday is out and posted look at this cutie with cake and some random dude. Thanks everyone for the honesty I liked her and should have used my brain instead. Guess it's over",

Here's what I think based on my own experiences: 1) When someone disrespects you like this, they don't see you as their equal so the relationship will forever have a shoddy foundation. They use this power dynamic to undermine you to feel powerful and confident, because they're still looking for someone else and the confidence helps them score higher than they would otherwise. 2) When they want to keep you a secret without having any good reason (like living in a place where coming out is contentious or even dangerous), it means they're keeping their options open. You're the safe reliable backup choice to this gal until she finds someone she finds more interesting or feels more compatible with IMO.\n\nSave yourself some time and energy and find someone who offers mutual affection and respect, and don't let one person being shitty to you keep you from being the best and brightest version of you possible to others. :]",

Which psysiologically speaking would be highly advantagious in the sunny environments blacks are native to. \n\nEveryone needs to nap/take breaks throughout the day, but whites likely would only do so inside or under shade. Blacks however would simply stretch out right next to where they were working thus apearing as though they were slacking off on a job they were actually doing...\n\nNow that I think of it, when I was younger, during P.E. after we got dressed we had to \"stand\" on a designated number while waiting for the teacher. On some days it was VERY hot, but I would lay down close my eyes and very nearly fall asleep. NOONE did this and often gave me a look like what I was doing was weird. But it seemed normal to me: Sun hot= lay down.\n\nIt also speaks to the fact that our skin protects us from the sun, but leads to vitamin D deficiencies. So not only can we take in alot of sun, we kind of need it. This is likely why blacks are [more susceptible to covid](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/08/us-blacks-3-times-more-likely-whites-get-covid-19) especially in the cases of quarantining(although there may be other more prevalent reasons). \"touch some grass\" in our case could literally save your life.\n\nYou've given me alot to think about...",

            "There are a lot of good answers here.  I am going to focus on more of the 'how to.'\n\nAll women are different - and you should ask your partner specifically what she likes.\n\nMost women, 70-80% cannot 'cum' or orgasm with penetration alone.Doesn't mean we don't love dick - it's just a damn curse I guess.  :P\n\nThe majority of us need some stimulation - or a lot in many cases - tongue, hands, toys - generally around our clitoris.Think of it as being the sensitivity equivalent of the head of your penis.  It's located pretty close to the upper wall, closest to our belly button.  \\[Just google it.\\]If you're using your fingers, you want to summon the genie to make all your wishes come true.  As far as how long, some women cam cum in a few minutes, some take an hour.Everyone is different, though I personally would say 10-20 minutes for me.Most of us can cum multiple times.We do not 'ejaculate.'  In my experience, we do secrete a milky white or clear lubricating fluid.I wouldn't worry about making women squirt.  Not all that common, and more of something people get into later on in their sex lives.You don't need to treat sex like something out of a manual.  Don't worry about squirting - it is not as common as some people have made it out to be.  Express yourself, be passionate and have fun.  She'll know if you're fumbling around investigating.\n\nEdit:  Also something to think about.  Some women cannot cum, and anti anxiety/depression pills often prevent it.",

            "Oh boy okay. I'm going to delete this later but since a lot of men are answering, I feel like a girl could pitch in.\n\nNote I'm going to assume masturbation. Having sex takes longer since you have different goals (having fun & getting off together vs cranking one out)\n\nHow long it takes is different, just like it is for men. If sincerely motivated I can get off in like 5-8 minutes; but the orgasm that comes from that isn't very powerful. I can definitely also go longer to get a more powerful effect. The actual orgasm itself is short. I haven't timed myself, but I imagine it's basically always under 5 seconds.\n\nWhat \"comes out\" is pussy juice, basically just... fluid. Same kind fluid as when we get wet, but more of it. It doesn't shoot or squirt or gush out for most ladies, we just get dripping wet. How much depends on how powerful the orgasm is; for the quickie I mentioned up there I barely get any but if it's a more powerful orgasm I have to go wipe up or deal with wet underwear the rest of the day.\n\n[edit: while you're here, scarleteen is a great sex ed resource you can take a look at.](https://www.scarleteen.com/)",

            "30F, I just want to add in since a lot of the comments are involving the clit, I don't see anyone mentioning nipples. The first time I had an orgasm with a partner was from purely nipple stimulation. It took longer, but they are an important part of my overall experience. \n\nI'm sure the sensitivity of nipples varies just like everything else, but for me it feels just as good as the clit.",
            "Okay female here (24)! As I can see a lot of guys replied which is better than nothing, and they got a lot of the stuff right but I'll just add a bit.\nI assume most females takes longer to come than men. Maybe around 5-10 minutes on a good day and 15-20 minutes on a bad day. When masturbating there is fliuds coming out of the vagina that acts as lubrication when having sex. I saw some guys here calls it pussy juice. Only really rare times (which also varies from girl to girl) the orgams can have a ejaculation in shape of more fluids, also called squrting.\nA female orgams is normally around 10 sec give or take (I counted once) and it is possible for a female to come more than once if she keeps masturbating. A friend of mine came 6 times in a row, yes girls also shares mastubation stories.\nHope this helped. Otherwise throw a comment and will answer.",
            "Woman here. All of this is valid for me only, everyone is different.\n\nWhen I masturbate I orgasm in a minute or so, extremely fast. This is because I know exactly what I like, which is wet fingers massaging my entire genital area including (but definitely not only)  my clit. This kind of orgasm is a very quick good feeling and is over very fast so I often do it two or three times in a row.\n\nOrgasming from sex can last longer but it's also never longer than like 4 seconds? And getting there, for me, depends on two things that are equally important: how hot the situation is and how much the other person's body is banging on my clit. So missionary can be romantic but my clit is getting mushed a lot so I climax fast, and doggy style my clit isn't getting any attention but the whole thing is so hot and there's moans and all that so I can also climax.\n\nThis is why communication is very important, if a woman can't climax if her clit isn't being banged on then you should work together on choosing positions where your private parts bang together haha\n\nCumming is a whole another thing. I won't comment much on it because for me it's not directly related to pleasure. Sometimes when I'm penetrated at an angle or something, I don't know the exact trick, there's a lot of fluid released and quite frankly it's just messy. It's hot for a minute but then it's just annoying to clean up haha",
            "27F late to the party but just wanted to throw my 2 cents in. \n\nWhen me and my boyfriend have sex I don't always cum, but he can keep me in the state right before cuming for a while, and its like 85% of the awesomeness of cuming. He can still get bummed out if he doesn't get me there, but honestly I prefer 85% of the feeling for a min and a half over 2 sec of actual climax.\n\nAs for what comes out, I rarely squirt and it isn't really a great indicator, I can squirt when not cumming and overall its meh. When I do cum I usually release a lot of lubrication, and have already been doing so, but some people are pretty dry. I have a friend who can't make anything happen without lube because she bearly gets wet even when very turned on.\n\nJust listen to your partner and work together.",

            "OK. Here we go.\n\nFor a lot of women, most orgasms are clitoral. The clitoris is a bump at the top on the inside of the labia. It is a bundle of nerves that is very sensitive, much like the head of the penis. \nStimulation through intercourse, with your hands or mouth, is quite nice. Sometimes it takes a while to get the angle right with intercourse, at least in my experience. It's all about how turned on you are, how into the moment you are and how much your partner wants to work with you to make it happen. \n\nIf you're a guy, please don't be that guy who just gets himself off and trusts that she enjoyed it as much as you did. Communicate. Help her feel comfortable enough with you to tell you what she likes, then do it! \n\nI hope this helped. Hang in there. There are lots of resources online to help you figure things out, but don't look at porn as an education tool. Those are paid actresses for the most part who may or may not actually get off.",
            "[removed]",
            "The absolute most important part of sex is clear consent and communication. Ask your partner(s) what they specifically like and dont like, if they're comfortable showing you that can be helpful for both of you and if they don't know they can find that out whether they want to with you or on their own. Make sure check in regularly; \"do you like this?\" \"would you like if i did this?\" \"is this okay?\" etc. Always no matter what do not initiate anything or continue if you havent gotten a clear yes\n\nNow for anatomy, all the parts as a whole is called the vulva, the hole itself is the vagina, and the clitoris the small nub part at the top which for some people is covered mostly covered by the clitoral hood. People with vulvas can't \"cum\" in the way that people with penises do, noting comes out, but we can orgasm, a lot of people just call it cumming. Most people, around 70-80% can't orgasm from penetration, or at least not penetration alone, and need clitoral stimulation also, that doesnt mean penetration doesn't feel good though, most of us like it but just can't reach that high point with only penetration. Most of us also don't like things very hard or fast at the beginning and need time to sort of warm up, but everyone is different. Most of the time when we're stimulated we get wet, our vaginas naturally produce lubricant, but some peoples bodies dont produce enough and most people have periods of time where their bodies dont produce enough so sometimes extra lubrication is needed and sometimes its isn't. As for how long it takes to orgasm it really depends on the person, for some it only takes a few minutes and for others it can take an hour or more and some people cant always orgasm (still feels good, just cant reach the high point) but on average it takes around 20-40 minutes for most people with vulvas, a lot of us can also orgasm multiple times. For a lot of people with vulvas being in the right headspace is very important (this is true for most people in general, but mood tends to be a little more important to people with vulvas on average) being comfortable and relaxed is nessicary for a lot of us, just make sure to communicate with partners\n\nAnd absolutely never try to learn anything from porn, it's like trying to learn to fight from an action movie\n\nIf you want resources for sex education that are easy to digest i would reccomend watching Hannah Witton on youtube [https://www.youtube.com/hannahwitton/featured](https://www.youtube.com/hannahwitton/featured)\n\nSpecifically these videos might be a good place to start:\n\n[https://youtu.be/XDOS6TwbPAc](https://youtu.be/XDOS6TwbPAc)\n\n[https://youtu.be/FuQzQxL\\_y9g](https://youtu.be/FuQzQxL_y9g)\n\n[https://youtu.be/aJmdds\\_tMsE](https://youtu.be/aJmdds_tMsE)\n\n[https://youtu.be/w5\\_Qzzq14LA](https://youtu.be/w5_Qzzq14LA)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/qnmqPMfJCAs\n\nI would also reccomend looking through r/SexPositive\n\nI'm so glad you're asking people instead of going off of just what your sex ed says, so thank you!",

            "Howdy! It\u2019s normal and great you are asking questions about this. \n\nThe time it takes a woman to climax is very personal ti her and her partner(s). I\u2019ve experienced women who can climax in 3 minutes and some that struggle each time. There is no clear cut answer to this question. \n\nMost women climax when clitoral stimulation. There is growing evidence that even vagionial  stimulation is just from nerves from the clit.",
            "One thing I see a lot of people forgot to mention is that women need foreplay. Women are turned on more by mental stimulation, rather than just eye candy, so kissing, touching, grinding, all of that is good, thou ask her what she likes or wants. It also makes it go smoother. There no such thing as being \"tight\"or \"loose\" the vaginia is a muscle that can stretch to accommodate a baby and then shrink back to it's normal size with some healing. A dick is nothing, but if she feels way too tight and dry, she not turned on enough, vs if it has a bit more give, for lack of better warning, and wet, that good. And it's always somewhat damp, but if it feels really wet then shes probably turned on enough. Lube also makes the job easier and better for everyone",

            "Since im going to assume you still havent got with a girl, well, you first need to warm up, some cuddling, some ear play, kisses on the neck, hands just exploring the body, then its like a dance. Do no be aggressive, and continue the warm up, you can do oral, its almost like making out with her mouth, but down there. \n\nOnce you feel like the girl is wet, shes ready. Most women, dont cum if thye arent warmed up, we need it, and we need the wetness, specially to be easier for the sex. Most women dont cum during sex, some may cum better through rubbing the clit, others from fingering, you just need to be vocal about it. \n\nCumming also depends on how horny/wet and what the other person is doing, you need to start slowly then go harder, but not brute. Its ok if you tried and we didnt cum, its actually quicker for us to cum, around 10min or so. Usually nothing really comes out, most likely stuff drips, like our wetness, maybe some white thing which is cervix muc may come out. I dont believe in squirting, much more you get extremely wet, i never heard of anything just squirting out unless its from porn.",

            "Girls anatomy is a bit different, because there are two main structures involved. One being the \"clitoris\" which is located on the outside and resembles a small protrusion at the top of the female genitalia.\n\n The clitoris is a collection of nerve endings which also extend inside and are not visible. The second anatomical structure is the \"vagina\" which is located on the inside of the female genitalia and is a tube like structure, which the penis/other things are inserted into, the vagina is sensitive also, and there is a specific structure at the back of it which is called a g-spot. Most women (not all) experience orgasms by stimulating the  clitoris (by rubbing, using sexual aids, etc) while others experience an orgasm only through vaginal penetration (inserting things into the  vagina and stimulating the g spot), while the majority of women experience orgasms by stimulating both the vagina and clitoris. \n\nWhen females get aroused, the genitals flood with blood and the clitoris gets erect (much like a male penis) and the vagina starts secreting a clear fluid, this fluid is for lubrication. The female does not usually ejaculate, although some women (this is controversial) will ejaculate a stream of clear fluid, in slang terms we call this \"squirting\", but this is a rare and disputed phenomenon. The orgasm is the contraction of pelvic muscles following stimulation.",

            "Okay so the clit is it! \nI (29) cishet f. I\u2019ve been stimulated to the point of an almost/minigasm through nipple play once, foreplay with an experienced partner that lasted about two hours(the stimulation and play not orgasm). Nipples can be erogenous zones for people but they\u2019re more of a wind up toy than a bam button. \nThink of it as hand job with only a gripped shaft no tip stimulation as a pleasure comparison. Feels good almost gets you there but you need just a little more!\nSame thing for the g spot!\nThe second spot you can stimulate to orgasm is the g spot! It exists I promise but if I want to orgasm that way it\u2019s usually through masturbation and the use of a specific slim bent tip vibrator. The clit is in the center of the inner labia at the top of the slit, a little above the vagina opening. The g spot is on the inside of the vagina opposite clit. It is a slow build orgasm as well, it takes me about 30-45 minutes to orgasm through gspot stimulation alone but oh-ho-ho worth it! I can find it with a partner in specific positions ie reverse cowgirl and bent over doggy style(but only with my legs straight not knees bent).\nI want to disclaim anything I say with I\u2019m not a doctor and this is literally just my experience and what I fact checked for terminology.\nHail the holy jewel of the crown the minorslabia!\nThe clit.\nIt\u2019s all about that precious lil bead, bean, bud, nub.\nBasically it\u2019s an orgasm firework. \nA little lube if you\u2019re not going down goes a long way, look into what is safe for women to use and be open to using toys. \nCircular movement that roll the clit around, making a slim v with your pointer and middle finger around the clit moving in an up and down motion, sucking and tongue flicking, deep licks in a repeated pattern, NOT your pad of your pointer in direct contact but instead use three to swipe back and forth quickly.\nEveryone has different preferences but the BIG TRUTH NO GIRL IS TELLING YOU !!!THE CLIT=CUM!!!! Strictly penetrative sex never makes girls orgasm. I don\u2019t know how many time my brunch has been spoiled by girls lamenting bad sex. Bad sex is selfish sex.

            "Orgasms between men and women are actually very similar in that an orgasm is the release of tightened pelvic floor muscles (the muscles are tightened by sexual stimulation). Nothing comes out unless a girl \u201csquirts\u201d which is a fluid coming out of the urethra. The length of time it takes to cum varies greatly. For me, if I\u2019m sufficiently aroused I can orgasm in 30 seconds with a vibrator. During sex, it takes me about 15-20 minutes if I orgasm at all. Fun fact: only 28% of women can orgasm without clitoral stimulation.",
            "you have to separate orgasm and ejaculation. in males, orgasm causes ejaculation to happen. in females there's just an orgasm. cum is a stupid term which can encompass any of the above.",
            "First of all: god question and kudos for daring to ask! \nFor me (25f) it\u2019s all very different depending on the situation and mood I\u2019m in. I\u2019ll try to give an overview without being too wordy. \n\nFirstly, a bit of anatomy that is way too often left out: the clitoris is the most sensitive part to physical touch and is actually a huge organ. The little knob thingy above the opening of the vagina is called the glans clitoris and makes up only a tiny part of the whole thing. It spans around the vagina and swells up when aroused, like the penis does in men. You can look at Wikipedia for an anatomical image of it. \n\nStimulation of the clitoris is the most secure way to make a woman orgasm, but other things can enhance the experience. E.g. stimulation of the nipples, gentle touching of the whole body or specific parts depending on personal preference, mental stimulation (dirty talk, compliments, the visible or audible arousal of the partner, etc.), or penetration. Though only comparatively few women achieve an orgasm through penetration alone, it can help to deepen the feeling (pun intended!). \n\nAs for the way of the stimulation: again it depends on personal preference. Usually a soft stroking either back and forth or in circles on the glands clitoris or the entire vulva does the trick (the vulva is the entirety of the female genital area), but it varies a lot depending on person and situation. \n\nHow long it takes is again very dependent on person and situation. A huge part of sex happens in your head and not your body, which is why porn and sexting work and why you need to be in the mood and relaxed. \nFor me, when I masturbate, it takes anywhere between three and fifteen minutes, depending on if I want the orgasm-pressure out of my system or if I\u2019m sitting (lying) down to enjoy myself thoroughly. \nWith a partner it\u2019s different though. It usually takes me a few weeks to get used to a new partner and learn to trust them and relax with them. Also they first need to learn how I like it before I can cum with them. \nAs an example: with my latest partner I orgasmed once in the beginning, then not at all (though I still enjoyed having sex thoroughly) for some months, and when we started to figure things out, he made me cum every time. This was because he knew what I liked and I wasn\u2019t in my head about taking too long or not looking good enough or anything anymore. \nWhen I have sex (which often times is more fingering, cuddling, touching, oral than it is penetration), it usually takes me somewhere between ten and thirty minutes to come. Depending on mood, foreplay and actual simulation. \n\nAn orgasm for women can last anywhere between a few seconds to almost a full minute. Mine vary in that entire range, so it\u2019s not a fixed duration but again it varies a lot. \n\nWhat comes out... mucus. The stuff that women have as natural lube. Similar to what men secrete when they are aroused, but it tastes differently, since it\u2019s on the acidic end of the pH spectrum, while men\u2019s is alkaline. \nIf you have sex with a woman, get her to wipe herself afterwards! She may be too flustered to ask for a wipe, so it would be a good idea to wipe yourself and casually offer her one or something along the lines. Otherwise bacteria and the coolness of evaporation can cause UTIs and bladder infections (been there, it\u2019s not fun!). \n\nRight now I can\u2019t think of anything else that would be important to add. If you have questions, feel free to ask in the comments or drop me a direct message if it feels too private to comment.\n\nEdit: wording about wiping afterwards.",
            "the most important part of an orgasm for people with vaginas isnt any sort of ejaculation but a rhythmic involuntary contraction (clenching) of the muscles lining the vaginal walls. think of that as being equivalent to the muscle contractions that push sperm out when someone with a dick orgasms. don't worry about what if anything comes out during orgasm for someone with a vagina though, i feel like cis men greatly over-emphasize the importance of that because they associate orgasm with ejaculation or watch too much porn but it's kinda just a thing that happens sometimes\n\nalso, not all girls have vaginas, some are trans.",
            "Woman here. It\u2019s important to note that some women can\u2019t cum at all. It isn\u2019t a one size fits all situation.",
            "It depends a lot. If I'm in the mood it takes 1-5 minutes or almost an hour if I'm not. Most women orgasm via stimulation of the clitoris, and penetrative orgasms aren't common. With a clitoral orgasm there are vaginal muscle contractions. The orgasm high itself last for up to 5 seconds depending on the women, and the contractions can last up to 30 seconds. The comments I see about gushing may refer to what many call squirting, which is a release of fluids that comes from stimulation. It is not pee, but can contain some urine. The most important thing to remember is that every girl is different and all these may not apply to everyone. There are many helpful channels on YouTube and a quick Google search should provide some medical sources as well. Hope this helps",

            "If your environment is that strict, assume that any woman you're intimate with has not been taught anything about her own body. \n\nMoreover they are probably crippled into petrified silence when it comes to talking about sex and arousal, especially when it concerns their own desires.\n\nTake your time to explore together what makes her orgasm, but don't make the orgasm the single goal.\n\nPractically: A woman has three holes down there. The middle one is the vagina. The front one is for peeing, the back one for pooping. They are protected by two sets of skin folds, and where the top set comes together is the clitoris. Which is NOT a doorbell, but an extremely (often painfully) sensitive ganglion.\n\nThe entire area is sensitive to stimulation. But by no means the only point for sexual and erotic stimulation on her body. The nipples are obvious, but anywhere where the skin is thin (neck, earlobes, inside of the wrist) as well. \nI found that genital stimulation alone is not always enough to lead to an orgasm.",
            "Women\u2019s orgasm is a muscular reaction to stimulus. Nothing necessarily comes out upon orgasm. What people describe as being \u201cwet\u201d can occur without any direct stimuli and can happen before or after orgasm. How long is dependent on multiple factors such as preference and level of comfort.\n\nMany people are talking about \u201csquirting\u201d here. I just want to add that this should not be a goal or a measure of talent. Most women just don\u2019t do that. Not achieving that porn reaction is no measure of prowess on you or your partner.",
            "From what my gf and i been discussing, she told me is not that long until she has an orgasm it takes her less than 10 minutes if she wants to, it could take her a bit longer if it was over repeated occasions the same night. \n\nWhat it comes out even before having the orgasm and ejaculation is what she told me is, a vaginal discharge (IDK if it's the right word, English is not our native language) but it's basically this fluid that makes a woman \"wet\" so after they came they expell this fluid and make them more wet. \n\nFeel free to correct me",
            "How do girls cum?\n\nMost women don\u2019t orgasm from penetration alone and  need at least some clitoral stimulation. Most, not all- everyone is different. \n\n\u201cWarming up\u201d is also very important for women so make sure she is very aroused (wet) before penetrating\u2026that will increase her chances of reaching orgasm.\n\nWhat comes out?\n\nHard to explain but just more of the vaginal fluid we produce when aroused. It doesn\u2019t shoot or squirt out like men\u2019s does, more just releases/pours out from our vagina all at once, if that makes sense. If you touch her there afterwards you\u2019ll notice she\u2019s really wet. How much fluid depends on each woman and how powerful the orgasm.\n\n(Not to be confused with \u201csquirting\u201d you see in porn, which I believe if just pee and not something a lot of women can do or care for)\n\nHow long does it take?\n\nAgain, depends on whether she\u2019s masturbating, having sex, getting clitoral stimulation, etc. \nPersonally, masturbating with a vibrator (focusing around clitoris), its sometimes taken me as little as a minute if I\u2019m significantly aroused or it can be up to 20 minutes or so (especially without a vibrator). For penetrative sex I\u2019ve heard it takes most women at least about 20 mins, but it can be longer. \n\nAgain, a lot of this depends on how aroused we are beforehand. Also, our sensitivity & libido varies based on where we are in our cycle. I find that around my period I\u2019m very sensitive and with clitoral stimulation I come very, very quickly. During ovulation we tend to have a much higher sex drive and get more wet, etc. \n\nI would also add, many women say they can orgasm repeatedly, keep in mind that\u2019s not true for all women. Some of us are done after one and need a short break before going for another. \n\nAnd lastly, don\u2019t learn anything from porn- the women are faking and that\u2019s not how women really act during sex/orgasm!",
            "Girls orgasm the same way for the most part as men. Stimulation of erogenous zones. However, girls don't turn on in the same was as men. For this example I am referring to men as those with penises and women/girls as those with vulvas and clitorises. Girls take time to get aroused. It's a gradual build up of emotions and feelings as well as consistency. Most men can jerk off pretty quick or cum just by putting their dicks in something then moving faster. It's like in most cases there's a set amount of time or strokes then a man will cum. Girls aren't the same. Girls and women in my cases are about patterns or rhythms. You can stimulate a woman slowly the way she likes and she'll cum. But the key is to what she likes. For example, a woman might have a spot on her clit that she like to be licked a certain way. If you keep licking it the same speed she tells you, boom orgasm. Fingerling is no different. Women need to tell you what they want, where as men just want anything. The famous \"Don't stop!\" line that many women say literally means, keep doing what you are doing. Many men think this means \"Go faster!\" which is completely wrong. It means don't stop whatever is being done. Just about every woman knows what will make her cum, most men just don't care or don't listen. Or in a lot cases lose interest after they have cum. I've found women cum easier with oral or fingering, if done how she requests or asks. Just cranking away at her urethra isn't going to work. It's all about how she feels it, likes it, and what she tells you. There's a myth perpetuated by many religions factions that girls/women don't like sex. That's complete bullshit. They love sex just the same as men, just most men don't listen or pay attention to what women want.",
            "Someone else may have posted this already but I recommend reading She Comes First by Ian Kerner. It's a quick and easy read that gives detailed explanations of female anatomy and the sexual arousal process, as well as many instructions for having enjoyable and fun sex with a woman. If you're uncomfortable about someone seeing the cover, check if your local library has an ebook version available. Most libraries let you check out ebooks via a smartphone app. I recommend the ebook over the audiobook so you can see the diagrams. Some of the most important takeaways I personally got from She Comes First are the following:\n\n* The clitoris is the \\*only\\* human organ with the sole purpose of providing pleasure. A penis does provide pleasure, but is also used for peeing and ejaculating sperm for reproduction. The clitoris serves no purpose other than pleasure, which is very cool!\n* The clitoris is huge. It's not just the small \"button\" at the top of the labia. The entire structure is mostly internal, so that little bundle people refer to as the clitoris (the clitoral glans or head) is actually just the tip of the iceberg. The entire organ has multiple \"legs\" which extend down and back internally around the vaginal canal. Depending on individual anatomy (of which there is a huge enough variety that broadly speaking, no one is abnormal), this means that vaginal penetration may provide pleasure, but not always direct enough stimulation to achieve orgasm. Different bodies get off from different things, and this book gives great tips on ways to accommodate different bodies.\n* There are roughly twice as many nerve endings throughout female genitals than male genitals. This doesn't mean that women's orgasms are better or stronger necessarily, but it does tell us that women are largely able to orgasm, so ignore any myths about how women don't like sex as much as men or how they can't come and always fake it. If someone is convinced that women don't orgasm, that says more about that person than about women's ability to enjoy sex.\n* Many of those nerve endings are in the external parts of the genitals (collectively called the vulva). IIRC, the embryonic tissue that forms into the head of the penis if a fetus has the Y chromosome necessary to become male will otherwise develop into the labia. Generally this means you should touch and lick outside the vagina as much as the inside. (The equivalent advice for helping a man enjoy a blow job would be to touch, tongue, and suck the head of the penis as well as the shaft)\n* The arousal process is different for men than it is for women. In very simple terms, basically men get there quickly and once they ejaculate they're done, whereas women take longer to get there, but once they get there, they can stay there for much longer. This means women generally take more time to reach orgasm, but because their arousal doesn't drop off immediately after orgasm the way it does for men, they can do it again, and again, and again. For many women, each orgasm makes the subsequent one easier to achieve. This is really good news for men: it means that the more they help women come, the more fun sex will be!\n* On the above note, the sensitivity of a woman's genitals changes several times throughout the arousal process. In particular, the clitoris is usually sensitive at the beginning of arousal, so don't jump in by rubbing, licking, or even touching the clitoral head first thing. For many women, it's better to start by touching the erogenous - or pleasure - zones around the genitals, like the inner thighs, the pubic mound, the lower abdomen, and then the labia (the lips of the vagina). Generally the clitoral hood (flap of tissue over the clitoral head) will pull back as blood fills the labia and causes the lips to swell, and when that happens you can begin to gently contact the clitoral head. (I use the terms 'for many women' and 'generally' because, again, anatomy varies enormous between people) Likewise, the clitoral head can get VERY sensitive and almost painful to the touch near or after orgasm, so be sure to check in with any partners about what feels good and when.\n* Oral sex doesn't need to be painful for the giver. In fact, if you find your tongue is getting tired, it's probably a sign that you're thrashing about too much and not helping either of you. For most women, a better tactic is to hold your tongue flat against the clitoral head and move it or your head/neck (pretend you're licking a lollipop that you're holding inside your mouth, instead of sticking your tongue out at someone). Again, the book gives many many more instructions for technique, but just remember that you shouldn't be getting tired or feeling achey or sore.\n* Men reach a phase of ejaculatory inevitability, or the \"point of no return\" where they are going to orgasm even if they pull out or stop stroking. For most men, the best way to get to that phase from the previous one is to speed up or tighten up (ie. thrust/squeeze/jerk harder and faster). Women do NOT have a point of orgasmic inevitability, so if a woman ever says something like \"don't stop\" or \"right there\" or \"just like that\" you need to take her literally and do not change your pace, rhythm, direction, or pressure. Do not move from RIGHT THERE and DO NOT STOP doing whatever you're doing JUST. LIKE. THAT. Unless you're both into orgasm denial ;)\n* Oral sex is sex. It is not foreplay or a chore to get through so you can finally start actually having sex. Because many women aren't easily able to orgasm from vaginal penetration, you need to mentally frame oral sex as one of the main acts and not a warmup show - thinking otherwise will make you a selfish and unsatisfying lover.\n\nThese are just the big eye-opening points I got from this book, but I highly recommend reading it for more detailed, instructive, and descriptive information. Have fun :)",

            "One more thing I\u2019d like add that a lot of conservative/religious household try to pass off as true, SEX ISN\u2019T SUPPOSED TO HURT!\n\nA lot of religious people make sex out to be this thing that\u2019s just about procreation. Something that the woman is supposed to do cause it\u2019s her duty as a woman. And that it\u2019s supposed to hurt and she shouldn\u2019t enjoy it at all. Or that she\u2019s supposed to bleed the first time because of her hymen breaking and that if she doesn\u2019t she\u2019s not a virgin. None of that is true!\n\nFirstly: the hymen is a thin curtain of tissue that partially covers the vaginal opening. The hymen can break from any kind of physical activity, from horseback riding, to riding a bike, or doing a split. Most girl\u2019s hymen break sometime during puberty and for some even earlier than that. A broken hymen doesn\u2019t mean she isn\u2019t a virgin.\n\nSecondly: sex is not supposed to be painful nor should it make her bleed. If a girl is \u201ctight\u201d it\u2019s because she\u2019s anxious or nervous or scared. The vagina is a muscle and when the woman relaxes the vagina loosens up to accommodate whatever is going inside. If it isn\u2019t loose and properly lubricated it will hurt- A LOT. Also some women just CAN\u2019T do penetration. There could be a lot of reasons to this from medical to emotional but just understand that sex should not hurt. That isn\u2019t to say there won\u2019t be some discomfort, but you need good communication with your partner to know their body and their limits. If they\u2019re in a lot of pain then it\u2019s time to stop.\n\nThirdly: sex is more than just \u201cinsert this\u201d or \u201cpull that\u201d. Sex can be great with the right person and can be a wonderful moment of intimacy.",

These things need to be talked about to people  when they get to that curiosity age.\n\n\nGirls don't \"cum\" the way males do. Some girls do excrete fluid from their vagina when aroused but this is primarily to lubricate an erect penis. During orgasm. Some women may produce enough to shoot a spurt or something but most just leak vaginal fluid. That's just all it is though. I wouldn't call it cum. \n\nGirls simply orgasm. They feel a rush of feelings because of the dopamine being released. Some women may squirt a bit. But porn, if you've seen it. Likes to exaggerate. And make them look like they're  drinking fountains. That's mostly urine and water and/or faked. \n\nLet's replace the word \"cum\" with orgasm. Women orgasm the same way as men. With repeated sexual stimulation and friction. They have the same build up and the same \"shocking\" climax feeling. Except women feel theirs longer than men and have no refractory period.  Meaing they can have multiple orgasms without feeling \"done\" with sex. How long it takes depends on the woman. And how good of a job the man is doing at pleasing her.",
            "When babies develop in the womb they start out the same, until their genitals start to form. But the genitals form the same way initially, sort of like a vagina but circle. If the baby is male, the \u2018clitoris\u2019 becomes enlarged and it grows into a penis, whereas a vagina becomes elongated etc. So essentially the head of the penis is a giant clitoris. \n\nAs a women, I know that generally if you get your clitoris stimulated it can result in an orgasm. This is sometimes difficult through penetration alone, as the clitoris isn\u2019t touched as much, though some women can orgasm through penetration alone without clitoris stimulation. The timing of the orgasm varies person to person. \n\nAs others have said, what comes out is generally more of a \u2018wetness\u2019, which is basically just to help the sperm into the uterus for procreation.",
            "1) You should know that \"female ejaculation\" is not the same as (though it may happen at the same time as) a woman's orgasm. Not everyone can or should be able to ejaculate like this and it is no measure of the enjoyment a woman is receiving, but female ejaculation may have involved stimulating more of the G-spot and the full structure of the clitoris (see below). Again though: these are different sensations, not necessarily better orgasms. What works for one person may have relatively little appeal to someone else.\n\n2) So far as \"how long,\" that really depends on the person and them in that moment. Very likely it will take longer than a man, and the reasons for that have a lot to do with the positioning of the organs involved. The penis is almost altogether exposed, with only the prostate buried in body tissue; only the head and a little of the shaft of the clitoris is exposed, but there is so much left buried under the surface (and it is this that vibration helps to reach, and can also be rubbed against- through the vaginal wall- during intercourse with the right amount of friction/sensitivity involved, but not everyone will get this out of intercourse and not for lack of trying or \"skill\").\n\n3) As an aside, a hard won lesson in my life is that, yes, sex is a skill: you learn it through experience as much as anything else. Except it is so much more than that. Sex *with certain people* is a skill, and to learn and have any experience on having sex with one person, you've both got to communicate on it. Positively communicate, at that- there are fewer more vulnerable moments than sex and criticism right after the fact will cut deep and almost guarantee relationship issues to one extent or the other. Tell them what worked well; ask them what they'd like for you to do again. You've got to communicate, but before all that you just have to be good to one another. Build each other up and support each other, and make sex a part of that. Sex is a drive as much as anything, the difference being that we can't technically die of sex starvation. But your partner should want to \"feed\" you and you them. That should be an act of love and affection. Good sex will come from the partners that are totally into one another before the bedroom. While puppy love doesn't last, affection and adoration for one another can absolutely continue.",

The bartholin gland which opens behind and slightly to the side of the vaginal opening in the vestibule (the vestibule is the part between the labia minora). This gland is the main one responsible for \"wetness\" and \"cum\" cum from.\n\n2. The skene's gland which surrounds the urethra (the urethra is in front of the vagina) and opens in the vestibule near the urethral opening (the urethral opening is also in the vestibule). As far as I know, what people call squirting is usually pee, but can sometimes be secretions from this gland.\n\n3. The cervix, which is above, and continuous with, the vagina. The cervix has glands in it that secrete mucous, which changes its thickness and amount with the menstrual cycle. It is maximum in amount and thinnest at ovulation, which is why the vagina feels more wet then.\n\nSo there you have it, the vagina is lubricated by these 3 glands. There are also a group of other sweat glands that release a thick substance different from normal sweat everywhere else. Men also have these sweat glands (called apocrine sweat glands). The glands are also present in the armpit and areolae, and their secretions are responsible for the smell you get from your armpits or pubic areas if you don't clean them. \n\nThat's all. If anyone has any questions or corrections, you can ask me!",
            "Maybe check out r/sexeducation?",
            "When most people with vaginas have an orgasm, nothing actually \"comes out\" (other than the natural moisture from arousal that was already present). How long it takes is totally dependent on the individual and circumstances (I.e if they're alone or with a partner, partner's experience with their likes and dislikes, etc.)\n\nThen there's also \"squirting\" which is a sudden rush of liquid from the vagina. It can be a little or a lot, and it can be a trickle or it can shoot halfway across the room. Not everyone is a fan of it and not everyone experiences it. A lot of people with vaginas don't actually even qualify it as an orgasm. It has a sense of release but typically not the full-body pleasure associated with the more typical orgasm. Its also mostly just fluid from the vagina, maybe with a little pee mixed in from the pressure on the urethra.",
            "i\u2019ve seen a lot of great answers on this thread and i\u2019d like to add on that the Planned Parenthood website has a HUGE section on education if you\u2019d like to learn more!",

I'm not saying you will wear it for every time you ever have sex but think of it this way. You could have sex one time and end up with a child and an STD. If you aren't ready to be a parent or to deal with the medical repercussions of an STD, condom. Protect yourself, protect your partner, and don't feel guilty about wanting to have sex. You're not a child. I'm so glad you are educating yourself when others wouldn't.",

How long does it take to reach orgasm?  It depends on a number of things, including the individual woman.  It can happen very quickly or take a while or.... never.  \n\nPS:  Don't depend on Reddit for important information.  Look elsewhere also.",

Normally, no, they just get wetter and Shakey. Sometimes there's cream, but I think that really only generates during penetration cuz it's her juice being rubbed around and lathering up.\n\nIf she shoots liquid out at you like in porn, she's pissing on you.

Partners always 1. think they fail or 2. think that something is wrong with ME because \u201ctheir other women ALWAYS get there\u201d. \nMen, I\u2019m sorry but many women fake because we don\u2019t want to hurt your feelings and you don\u2019t understand that it has NOTHING to do with you. \nTOYS (yes!!), fingers, flat surface to rub on (like a leg), tongue all add up to the big moment.

There\u2019s nothing wrong with talking about it with them. Share expectations and boundaries before, during and after.",
            "Woman here. We have the same internal experience as men when we cum but usually nothing \u201ccomes out,\u201d though I\u2019ve been told I shot some extra wetness out upon cumming. I don\u2019t ejaculate but it was just like extra natural lubricant that shot out onto a face or two (now my husband and also one pre-marriage fellow). On that note, I don\u2019t cum from dick alone, though I love being screwed. I had to teach my husband that just because I don\u2019t cum from penetration, doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t want to be fucked. In fact, I really do want to be fucked on some primal level. As for the orgasms themselves, you can feel it approaching like an oncoming train and then it smacks you and you\u2019re shaking and disoriented and the room spins and you need a few minutes to calm down. As for how long it can take: I can do it much faster with masturbation than anyone else could ever do to me, though my husband is very talented and diligent. However, when masturbating, I\u2019ll often keep \u201cedging\u201d (bringing myself close to orgasm and then backing off) because it feels so good and I don\u2019t want the good time to be over. I\u2019ve spent up to 5 hours doing this before. How fast my orgasms are possible though (without edging) depends a lot on my mood. Hope this helps!",

            "If you're referring to female ejaculate, \"squirt\" is pretty much entirely pee. Some people with vaginas (what I looked at said it's a real 'maybe' thing) do have a gland that makes a milky white fluid when sexually stimulated, but that's not anything like penis-based ejaculation and doesn't necessarily have anything to do with squirting. As well, the natural lubricant that makes vaginas wet when someone gets horny isn't really 'cum', it's more along the lines of a boner, really. If you're referring to actual orgasm itself, it's generally known to come in the form of muscle contractions and a sort of general feeling of release. If you're worried about pleasing your partner, ask! And important note, real life isn't like porn where people cum at the same time. One's probably going to cum first, if you cum before your partner and don't want to continue with penetration, there's always non-penetrative sex (hands and mouth for example.)",

            "Indigenous Australian for me - specifically the Yol\u014bu languages because that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been the most exposed to. I grew up in the outback and didn\u2019t particularly hear the locals speak in language that often (lots of kriol though) and the local language wasn\u2019t Yol\u014bu but hearing it always reminds me of home. \n\nThere\u2019s a film called Ten Canoes which I HIGHLY recommend - it\u2019s a story within a story narrative - an old man is telling a young fella a cautionary tale. It\u2019s very low key, a bit of drama, a lot of humour but almost no background music, just the sound of the Australian bush. There DVD has versions entirely in the Yol\u014bu languages. Sometimes I\u2019ll play the dvd in language with no subtitles and just relax and enjoy the sounds (it helps that it\u2019s a fairly simple story and I\u2019ve seen it so often I know it by heart). \n\nIf you want an idea of what Yol\u014bu languages sounds like listen to [Gurrumul](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MKC-Jd7KN64) - a legendary indigenous Australian musician.\n\nAlso the Welsh language.

            "I am fascinated with languages. Some are very relaxing to listen to, (French & Italian can sound relaxing & romantic) other sound a bit harsh (Dutch & Arabic are two), some sound very frenetic (Spanish & Japanese). All languages I seem to be able to understand the odd word, probably as English is composed of many words from other languages & also from 20 years of travelling the world. I can order a meal or dink in about a dozen languages, but only speak English & a little Tagalog (one of hundreds of dialects in Philippines, where I live now).\n\nYears ago I had a work colleague who officially spoke 12 languages fluently (acknowledged & paid an allowance by the company we worked for), varying from Italian, French, German to Arabic, Bahasa Indonesian & 4 Chinese dialects & could get by in conversation with many others too, due to knowing some of the major world languages having similarities. His parents were born in different countries & lived in a 3rd, which started him off & were diplomats, so he learned the countries languages they moved to, as a child & having to attend schools & was married to a Chinese lady who had relatives scattered over China, increasing his knowledge. He was great to go shopping with, especially in HK & Singapore, as when the shop keepers talked in their various dialects about how much to charge he could understand what they were sating & would discreetly tell you what to offer. You were usually told it was below cost, so we would just say no, start to walk out & we had them in, not wanting to lose a sale \\^ knowing the price we had offered was around what a \"local\" would pay & most times if we stuck to our price, we got it for that. Once we had the purchase completed, he would turn around and thank them for their help & reasonable price we paid, in their language, which surprised them somewhat, especially as this guy looked more like a Middle Eastern person.\n\nIt also fascinates me the way other languages are \"created\" by adding a word to another to means somethings else, or \"doubling up\" the same word to mean something else or the sequence of word (in Tagalog, mabuti means \"good\" but if you say mabuti na it means \"that's good\"). \n\nAs far as singing in another language some sound better when you don't understand the language & can be very relaxing to listen to. A classic example is a Tagalog song \"Anak\" meaning child y Freddie Aguillar. It sounds much better in its original language than English as these  vids show.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibmh64itn1M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibmh64itn1M) (In Tagalog with lyrics & cords)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oklvyDqCem8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oklvyDqCem8) (English with English lyrics)\n\nThe same goes for Edith Piaf's version of Non Je Ne Regrette Rien, it sounds better in French.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKSPOUEuqAE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKSPOUEuqAE) (English)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gsz7IuZ3paM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gsz7IuZ3paM) (French)\n\nI just love languages.",

            "It is more than okay, it's human. You're a human first, a boy as description. Cry when you need to, you'll know when that is. In the meantime, I highly recommend you learn anything and everything that interests you. If you like reading I can supply you with some good reads in topics you're interested in. There isn't much we can or should be doing for our parents, though it can feel like the child's responsibility. I'm sorry your life situation is what it is, but I can already tell by your inquisitive mind that you will be alright. A bit shaken, but not stirred or mixed up too badly. Stay curious, and remember the feeling of learning, it will be your sanctuary.",

            "It is always okay for a boy or a man to cry. It\u2019s a natural human thing to do. Don\u2019t let your dad try to convince you otherwise. My husband and my son have cried in front of me, and it is all okay.",
            "Speaking as a woman I am angry that boys and men get told to not cry. I think it makes them distant and, frankly, frustrating to be around. I think it takes strength to express your feelings openly.\n\n I have been glad to see some male politicians cry publicly and it be accepted (and I hope female politicians are allowed to do it without being called hysterical).\n\nSpeaking as a 60something person I want to say that tears are a beautiful gift of life..it is a moment of genuiness and honesty and those are precious. Share your tears with someone who can appreciate them. Your tears are a sign of your passion, the intensity of your sorrow and the basis for your resolve to grow.  Tell that to anyone who questions or mocks. Naming your emotional state may also dry your tears, it does for some.\n\nOf course there will be times when you dont want to cry..it isnt the right ppl, it is a too personal moment. In that scenario look upward (literally move your eyeballs to look up)..that seems to slow the tears.\n\nAnd there are times when you wish you could cry but it wont come. I lost a dear friend last week and I havent yet been able to cry- too dried out from the long journey. If you have some more to shed would you throw in a few for me? I would appreciate it. \n\nThank you for sharing your tears with us. They are precious and to be savored.",

If you are passing your courses, one grade is meaningless.\nI believe in you.",

Pushed to cry more times than I can count and spent a lot of evenings wanting to end it all, but being too chicken to because I didn't have a gun.\n\nLife gets so much better after you leave home. Life becomes so much happier, so much more fulfilling, so much more satisfying when your parents aren't breathing down your neck, ready to pounce on your every mistake. I understand your pain.\n\nSet a date in mind for when you're going to leave home. Count down to that day every single day. It helped me tremendously. Every day, was one less day I had to be home.

If he were here, I'd tell him that a man who isn't afraid to lay bare his vulnerabilities is braver than any bullshit macho tough guy act.\n\nI'm probably older than you by 20-30 years and I wish I could cry more often than I do, to be honest. I had a complete and utter bawling fit one day last year after a bunch of stuff came crashing down at once. I'm talking, collapsed at the top of the stairs, real ugly tears, the whole thing. Hadn't cried since almost 15 years before that, and I've known close people who have died in that span.\n\nWhen I cried, it felt like years of emotional weight being shed. And, it prompted me to go get therapy, which has been very helpful in processing some complicated feelings. I feel a lot better now, and my wife and family don't see me any less because of it. In fact, I feel much stronger expressing my feelings than not. \n\nDon't let others in your life regulate your healthy feelings. It's okay to be sad and express that sadness. If someone stops you, you're going to end up bottling those feelings up, and when they finally unleash themselves, and they will someday, it's going to be much worse. Better to let them out in manageable increments. You'll be happier and healthier as a result.",

I didn't want to cry, I just wanted to be stronger so I didn't have to.\n\n  \nNow, many years later, I miss crying.  I can feel the stress levels rising and it just gets buried.  I got stronger and trained myself not to cry because I bought into propaganda like the kind your dad is spewing.  Be authentic to yourself, cry if you need to.  What does a boy act like?

The most shocking result is suicide.\n\nSome men are the types who seldom cry and end up okay. But not everyone can be like that, or wants to be like that. If you feel like you want to cry, cry. Lock yourself in your room and sob into a towel, it feels really good.\n\nThere is really so much more to this world than worrying about not crying. There is so much I have to say about what a man is.\n\nI'll just say this: Those who support toxic masculinity... They may seem strong. But they are the most fragile. The things they make fun of others for are what they are most insecure about. Men who demean other men for crying are the ones who are most afraid of looking weak.",

            "Crying is perfectly acceptable.  As a man crying is something I wish I did more.  But crying is only part of what you have going on.  It is important to have supportive people in your life to help work through your emotions.  It may be a good idea to try to find a teacher coach or counselor or other another adult to help you work through your emotions. \n\nLet me tell you a story about crying as a boy.  When I was in high school I tried out for the cheerleading team as a joke.  In the middle of tryouts my father, who had given me permission to try out, burst into the gym and started screaming at me in front of several people including my peers, my basketball coaches wife, my former babysitter, the two cheerleading coaches, and another adult I do not remember.  He started insulting me in completely unacceptable ways and I stood up to him in tears.  It took me at least five minutes after he left to stop crying.  Every single one of those people talked to me about how awesome they thought I was because I was able to cry and recover from it as well as stand up to my dad.  The point here is not that you should necessarily stand up to your dad, but that crying is a healthy expression of emotion and people will often sympathize and respect your willingness to cry in an appropriate situation.",

Holding your feelings in, like your dad suggests, harms boys in many, many ways. \n\nFind someone you trust to show your feelings to when you\u2019re sad or down. Your dad was probably raised to not show his feelings and is, unfortunately, doing the same with you. You can\u2019t really change him, but you CAN pick and choose whom to show your feelings to. Boys who aren\u2019t allowed to cry sometimes become bullies or violent because their feelings have to come out somehow.",

It can take some time, depending on how sad you're feeling, but after you cry and feel better I would suggest getting \"back on the horse\" and moving forward. \nBeing able to do that is also part of dealing with stress. \n\nLike a quote from Batman Begins said: \n\"Why do we fall? \nSo we can learn how to pick ourselves up\"\n\nEdit: i saw that you asked what to do. \n\nI'm going to assume you're still in school? \nDo you have a counsellor or psychologist there that you can talk to?\n\nIt can feel scary or embarrassing the first time(s), but it might also be helpful to talk about your feelings and have someone listen to why you're sad.

You asked if it's okay for \"boys\" to cry, and of course the answer is yes, but... While I don't know your age, it appears from your question that you are no longer simply a boy, but rather, a young man. So when I say it's okay for men to cry, I don't mean simply that it's okay for males to cry, but also that it's okay for mature adults to cry. You are a man. A young one perhaps, but even so. Crying does not diminish this fact. \n\nThat said. There is wisdom in knowing when not to cry. Sometimes I feel like crying, but choose to hold back tears to help someone else. \nSome people say that crying is not weakness, and therefore it's okay to cry. I think that's close, but I would phrase it a little differently: it's okay to be weak sometimes, but it also is important to know when to be strong. It's okay to ask for help and support- in fact, it's not just okay, it's good and important. But also it's important to know when and how to stand on your own, even if nobody stands with you, to protect the people you love and to fend for what's right. There's a time for all things. \n\nTo answer your question simply- yes, it is absolutely okay to cry. Don't let crying be all that you ever do, but it is very much okay for men to cry. I don't know specifics about your situation, but I sincerely hope that things improve.",

I don't want to raise my son to kill that part of himself but I'm not going to pretend that our society doesn't judge boys harshly for that. He's young and gets overwhelmed by his emotions so he cries as a release, that's all normal. At the same time we all have to grow and we can't always have the luxury of being able to cry it out so sometimes we save that for when we are alone or with very trusted people.

You fucked that up too, didnt ya?\"\n\nItll keep him awake at night, trust me :-)\n\nWhich is actually something he needs as long as it brings about some meaningful self reflection on his parenting style.\n\n\nAnd please understand, I'm not faulting you for crying over what you were crying about.

I know plenty of adults who lose the capacity to cry because they\u2019re jaded and desensitized to strong emotion. Moreover, it\u2019s good for you to cry \u2014 it\u2019s a release your mind and body need. I will say that you should never use your tears to \u2018work\u2019 other people. I use the word \u2018work\u2019 because I don\u2019t like the word manipulate in this context. You can work someone with tears without meaning to manipulate them. Another thing I\u2019ll say is this \u2014 even though they shouldn\u2019t, there are many men (and plenty of women) who will judge you for crying. It makes some people uncomfortable, for others it calls up stereotypes they grew up with and can\u2019t really shed no matter how much they talk the talk. That\u2019s just the way things are. Be strong enough and confident enough in and with yourself to be able to know you\u2019re not the one in the wrong in those cases. The world is hard \u2014 I will not lie. Life is not easy, people can be mean. Please don\u2019t spend your time worrying about what most people think. There is no winning at that game. Just misery. Find a few people who know you, care about you, and want the best for you and worry about what they think of you. I imagine you\u2019d naturally put dad in that category, which is why it hurts to have him say those things. But if one of the people who you consider close, someone who has your best interest at heart, calls you names (not joshing with you, but out of malice \u2014 and usually out of their own insecurity) reassess the situation with that person. If they aren\u2019t who you thought they were, keep them at arms length and try not to take what they say too seriously. That doesn\u2019t mean you should ditch people that tell you hard truths you need to hear. Learning how to listen to people tell you things you disagree with and don\u2019t like is one of the very hardest things in life \u2014 and it took my 35 plus years to figure out.

            "I want to give a more nuanced answer than the ones that are already given. First off all I agree with the rest: yes, it is ok for boys to cry. \n\nAltough it is less socially accepted for boys to cry than it is for girls. Girls that cry receive support, where in the case of boys they are looked down on/made fun of. I know in a perfect world this wouldn't be the case and most of us want to realise such a world, but we aren't there yet.\n\nLooking from your fathers perspective it is understandable that he tries to learn you to not cry to easily. He is the one that raises you and has to prepare you for life. If you cry too easily and in too many situations, you are probably gonna have a really hard time. It might seem harsh to punish you for crying, but in fact he is protecting you and teaching you a lesson in life. \n\nSo I would say, yes it is ok to cry, but be sure to do it in a save environment/with people you can fully trust.",

It means you are scared of your difficult emotions, or worried about being judged. \n\nThere is much greater strength in feeling them, letting them pass through you and releasing them through tears.  \n\nIt also take even more enormous courage to cry as a boy or man, because of the expectations in our society. \n\nI personally LOVE a good cry, and it makes me so sad that you have been scolded for being human. \n\nYou dad has grown up in a different world. One in which our men were lied to from every angle, and told that crying was a sign of weakness. \n\nIt\u2019s still a bit like that now, but things are changing and society is starting to understand. \n\nBy having the strength to feel you emotions and cry, you will be helping the world continue to change for the better!",

            "I\u2019m not sure if this was a case of that, but it\u2019s honestly likely to be something known as a test case. \n\nAn easy way to sum it up is you put yourself in a spot where you can state claim for legal action to have it brought before the court and get case precedence to further define the law. Test cases usually come from actions like sitting on white side of the bus, opening a birth control clinic in a state where it\u2019s banned, owning a handgun in a city that has banned them (despite never owning a gun before), buying a wedding cake from a homophobic baker, etc.\n\nAs you can see, those are all situations where people intentionally put themselves in the situation in order to bring a suit and change the law. Rosa Parks sat on the white side after seeing Claudette Colvin get arrested. Rosa Parks literally rode the bus that day just to do that. Connecticut had banned birth control clinics as long as they could, so doctors would bus patients out to NY and RI to get birth control. Eventually, one doctor just opened a clinic in Connecticut, knowing full well he\u2019d get in trouble just to be able to challenge the law and define a constitutional protection. The right for *civilians* to own guns is actually a more recent constitutional protection (it was interpreted to at least protect military personnel\u2019s rights to own guns for a long time). Most states just didn\u2019t ban them, so it never got into question, but then D.C. banned any civilians from owning a handgun they didn\u2019t own before 1975. In 2008, a few D.C. civilians bought guns just so they\u2019d have grounds to challenge this law and get the Second Amendment to apply to all non-felon citizens. Then we get to the cake, which they bought knowing full well they\u2019d be denied, but would be able to make a case that extends equal protections to LGBTQ* people.\n\nSo, that\u2019s why, to be able to have a case for the law. While it\u2019s not limited to that, a lot of the test cases I think of have to do with Substantive Due Process, wherein a specific protection is not explicitly written into the Constitution, but it can be seen that the intent of the amendment would\u2019ve been meant to extend out to that. The idea is that if you get a majoritarian government in an area, they really wouldn\u2019t have a need to listen to the minority of citizens, but their rights should be protected. The birth control clinic (*Griswold v. Connecticut*) is a great example of this, along with the case you reference. *Griswold* interpreted that the First, Third, and Fourth amendments gave couples a right to privacy, and therefore the government doesn\u2019t have a right nor interest to regulate how couples have sex with each other. *Heller v. D.C.* is the gun case and also substantive due process.\n\nSo, it basically has to do with getting a test case to get the case heard before the court, and using substantive due process to create a precedent for the interpretation of the law",

            "This is one of those things where there are 5 different sides to the discussion and all of them use the seam word to mean different things.\n\n>Friendzone just means that person isn't interested in you sexually/romantically but wants you as friend.\n\nTo you, yes, that is what it means.\n\nTo the people who complain about being friendzoned, they are using the term to mean a form of emotional manipulation where the possibility of intimacy/relationship is constantly hinted at and teased but never delivered, as a way to obtain emotional and material support.\n\nWhether or not this is something that exists is another question - the people using the term this way are often not emotionally stable themselves, on the other hand women are human beings and like all human beings some of them are bad or cruel.  So who knows.\n\nBut the relevant point to your question is that the people complaining about it are not using the word to refer to the same things you are.",
            "Having friends is great. I absolutely agree. The problem with the so called friendzone is that one person has a romantic interest in the other. This makes the whole friendship very difficult in my opinion. \n\nThere are multiple different scenarios and it highly depends on the persons involved. But very very simplified it can lead to issues like:\n\n(A has romantic interest, B only wants friendship)\n\n* B knows that A has romantic interest but loves the benefits and attention that comes with it \n\n* As soon as A tries to move on B will give A hope again that there might be a romantic future \n\n* B meets a new partner soon and A will be jealous \n\n* B\u2018s future partner will probably know what\u2019s going on and it will be awkward to have your partner hang around work someone  \n\n* Most persons act way different when hanging out with someone they\u2018re interested in. It\u2018s likely that that A will put way more effort into the friendship than B (evenhough this might not always be the case)",
            "I get what you are saying but friendship and companionship are two very different levels of intimacy. If you think you are ready to open up on such a level with someone, getting that emotion and expression dismissed, especially by someone so close, can be extremely painful, and continuing a platonic relationship with someone who you wanted to be more with often ends up causing more suffering thinking about what could have been than happiness from what 'is'.\n\nFriendship and compassion are rarely about quantity, it's about the quality of the connection you have with someone. Being friendzoned forever changes the nature of your connection with a person. Having more friends is great, but having one friend who really understands you intimately is incredible, and loosing that opportunity with someone, it's permanent, and it's difficult. It takes a lot of time to recover from.",
            "I mean have you ever had romantic feelings for someone? Maybe your a masochist but typically if you care for someone in any way and the feelings aren't mutal its natural to feel hurt.",
            "Being friendzoned does suck but once you get over it, It\u2019s really not that bad. Most friends in general though never really last, just a few stick with you and that\u2019s totally ok.",
            "I definitely have had to grow up and come to terms with the concept that \"friendzoning\" basically means that you have not been given consent to exchange love. That means you as the \"pursuer\" CANNOT offer messages of love or attraction anymore than they could even see you in that light. It's not fair to the object of your affection to be told that you're fine with just being friends with them, only to continue the onslaught of affection.\n\nThere is a big difference also between friendzoning and \"benching\". Benching is when someone you like has told you something within the spectrum of wanting to just be friends, to wanting a relationship of romantic or casual nature, but possibly non-committal, while leading you on and not explicitly offering a committment to one type of relationship or another. Benching defines the role that someone assigns a person for the purpose of \"potentials\" they might have a bench of several potential lovers or friends, and they aren't explicitly clear about which you will be because they aren't sure yet, but they're okay with leading you on.\n\nThat is not cool, and I strongly suggest anyone who has been benched to take a good long look at yourself and realize that you deserve better, out of friends OR lovers. Break it off with these types of people, because they don't care about your feelings, and at the first sign of not meeting rheir expectations, they give you the boot. Don't get benched.\n\nEdit: grammar and clarification.",
            "Personally, I hate the fact that the \"friendzone\" is even a thing at all. The term seems to be most-frequently used by one who is bitter because the person they are romantically interested in does not requite those feelings.\nAnd they say \"oh they put me in the friendzone\", making themselves look deserving of pity and/or sympathy, and the other person look like an asshole for putting them in the \"friendzone.\"\nIt seems to take value away from the idea of friendship, and like if you can't be with someone romantically, it's their fault (when in reality it's no one's fault). Friendship is awesome and we should be happy to have more friends.\nBut idk, maybe I'm just an asshole. \ud83d\udc4d",
            "\"I like you as a friend\" is usually said to soften the blow. Your friendship is not incredibly important to that person, its just a polite thing to say.\n\nSo you dont really gain a friend either, just an awkward accquintance.",
            "There's nothing wrong with being friends with someone of the opposite sex (or anyone you would be attracted to) but you do need to be on the same page about what it is that you want, or, down the line, it will be deleterious to the mental health of one or both involved. If you have unreciprocated feelings for someone, and especially if they get good chemicals from your attention that make them willing to manipulate or exploit you in a way that would be atypical of an ordinary friendship, it's best to set and enforce your own boundaries. In the short term that can hurt both a lot, but in the long term it's much better.\n\nBoth men and women experience unrequited love, or the \"friend zone\" and it's their choice as to how to proceed, but it's worth knowing the risks that come from an attachment to someone who views you as disposable. Especially in an age where friendship is so temporary, flimsy and replaceable anyway. If someone doesn't want or value you in that way and it's affecting your mental health, cut contact completely and tear off the bandaid.",

And if she/he doesn't sooner or later you go seperate ways because friendship after knowing one is feeling so much more is becoming akward. \u0130t's not the same anymore and it's irreversible. Now imagine her/him going on dates and finding someone he/she thinks of as a Soulmate and you have to witness all of it cuz you are a \"good friend\" and get to know. \nFriendzone is easy for the friendzoner , not so much for the one being friendzoned\n\nYou`ve lost a good friend and someone you thought to be a Soulmate at the same time.\nYou've lost everything",

            "Because it can be absolute torture for some. Like me, after my ex broke it off she wanted to be friends and keep some of the perks of our relationship. I agreed but it really didn't take long for it to start hurting because I still had strong feelings. You don't really get over someone if they're still part of your life. And it can be really unhealthy for a lot of people and even corrupt future relationships, even if you don't think it will at the time. If the breakup was 100% mutual then maybe I can see it. But that's not what the friendzone is, you're only friendzoned if you'd rather it be romantic/sexual.\n\nIt's just a hard fact some really should admit to themselves, that even if they want and would miss the friendship side that they still actually want more. And sticking around could actively hinder their recovery and ability to move on. Sometimes things just have to end for the best and that pain is worth it over future pain of seeing someone you love and have history with move on, see other people, talk about other people to you. That shit is painful.",
            "Generally, whenever I hear this question, it's not being asked in good faith.\n\nThe short answer is that the \"friendzone\" has nothing to do with friendship.\n\nThe longer answer is as follows:\n\nFriendship is awesome. Friendship with the opposite gender (or whatever your target gender is) is also awesome. The 'friendzone' however, rarely, rarely ever involves true friendship. 90+% of the time, it's disguised emotional manipulation.\n\nI made this realization in my early-20s - I had met a girl I thought was cute, and we hung out a bit, but I could tell things weren't really clicking. She \"friendzoned\" me before I broke off with her, and being the inexperienced waif I was, I thought this actually meant being friends. She continued to call me periodically, and went through the whole thing where she dished to me about her other nascent relationships, and I listened, because I was being a good platonic \"friend\", and she always said what a \"great guy\" I was, and all that stereotypical FZ crap. Then I found out she was good friends with a girl I had noticed around campus, and I asked her about her friend and if she'd introduce me and give me a good word.\n\nShe got ***pissed*** at me. \n\nTurns out she had no interest in being friends with me, she just wanted attention, validation, and for someone to be pursuing her.\n\nIn my experience and observation, that is what is actually happening in the vast majority of friendzone-ings. After beginning to realize that, I started to use the \"introduce me to some of your cute friends\" as a \"friendzone\" test. If they were willing to introduce me to other girls, then they actually wanted to be friends. If they didn't, they had no interest in being friends, they just wanted to keep me on the hook for *their* needs.\n\nHonestly, now that I think back about it, in almost every instance where a girl genuinely wanted friendship from me, she would introduce me to one of her friends without my even asking...\n\nanyway...\n\n*Warning: over-generalizations incoming because addressing every variant on the gender spectrum would take waaaaay too long, and there are exceptions to everything*\n\nMales and females both have sexual and emotional needs, and for both genders sexual and emotional needs are very intertwined, but men and women do differ in terms of how they go about fulfilling those needs. For men, emotional validation is highly dependent on sexual validation; it's difficult for a man to feel emotional validation from a woman unless his sexual needs are being met (not necessarily by her). A woman who \"friends\" a sexually frustrated man comes off as patronizing and dishonest to his ears, particularly if/when she's still attempting to monopolize his attention for herself. A sexually fulfilled man, however, is far more open to receive casual emotional validation from platonic female friends. Women, in contrast to men, generally seek emotional validation ahead of sexual validation, and understandably become frustrated when men seek to flip that to serve *their* sexual needs instead.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nToxic \"friendzoning\" occurs whenever the FZer is using the FZee to fulfill the FZer's emotional/sexual needs while seeking to keep the FZee from fulfilling theirs. Being an actual friend, intimate or platonic, simply means that whatever fulfillment you get out of another is reciprocated in a way that helps them fulfill theirs as well. Otherwise, you're just using them.",

So what it really is, in different terms, is someone trying to date someone by being friends first, being rejected and the other person was genuinely seeking out a friendship the whole time.

Oh well!\"\n\nThis is why I find it unhelpful when people, especially on reddit, just go \"dude you got a friend now woo hoo! Quit whining!\". The individuals being friendzoned have strong romantic feelings for their friend, telling them to ignore it in the same realm of telling a depressed person to just be happy or ADHD person to just pay attention.

Also as someone that is a bit light sensitive these super bright displays/lights that are on dashboards now cause me fatigue, I have to turn them right down.

Money. The auto makers bought laws to make sales of actual small European trucks impossible due to tariffs, and then build these behemoths and paid millions and millions to shape public opinion so that instead of them being ridiculed and hated, now Americans somehow think it's cool when something the size of a small building mows people down in traffic.\n\nSame deal.

            "You watched the Drew Gooden Cybertruck video too, didn't you? LOL\n\nIt's not just that, the PRNDL stick is disappearing from cars that aren't so fancy too, opting for a dial or buttons to change gears.  I mean, I get that it's all electronics and not mechanics that changes gears anymore...but, we have muscle memory for the PRNDL.  We memorize the location of all our knobs and dials, and the tactile responses they give us when we click them let us know that they've been changed.\n\nMy 2018 journey, I can adjust the climate through either the touch screen, or the buttons and dials.  When I'm driving, I typically stick to the button and dials because I know that front defrost is the second from the right, and rear defrost is the last one on the right, and that temp is the buttons to the left of the knob for the entire cabin, or right for just the passenger side, and I know that the big knob controls the flow.  I know how many thunks it takes to go from P to D, or from D to R on my PRNDL stick.  I know to turn my wiper knob so many clicks to get the wiping speed I need, I can feel the click when I turn on my signal.  I'm listening to my car as much as I'm watching the road.\n\nIf I want to use the nav system, I can only use basic functions on it, like stop/start, or start a voice command when I'm driving.  When I'm parked, I have full access to the entire menu (though, it's a pain when you're the co-pilot...there should be some kind of co-pilot override, like if the weight in the passenger seat is so much, allow it to have full menu access, or something...I dunno).\n\nAll these new fancy EV cars that I've seen, everything is handled through a menu system that you have to navigate through.  No sense of intuition.  If someone who's never driven my car before gets in and asks me how to turn the wipers on, I just say, \"Left stick\" and they immediately know what to do with it.  With an EV, you \"navigate to road settings, then into driving, then over into windshield, then scroll down to wiper-mode, then select the inches/minute that it's raining.\"",
