I doubt anyone really knew/ understood that they couldn't see as well as they're supposed to unless it was really bad",
            "I got glasses in high school. Only because I couldn't read what was written in the classroom whiteboard. Other than that, I didn't have any problems or didn't think I needed them. Sure someone would say they could read farther than me but that was it. When I first put on glasses that's when I realized all the details I was missing out on. So I can see how people in the year 900 wouldn't even be able to tell they had a problem.",
            "As someone who's severely nearsighted, I think about this a lot. I guess we did, probably for a while after that too before glasses became generally available. The eye strain must've been terrible.",
            "I think about this a lot. I am severely near sighted (-6.50) and often just walk around my house without contacts or glasses to see if I\u2019d survive in a time without such correction. Lights are just orbs. Peoples faces are just blobs with maybe some sort of shadow dimension that denotes the location of eyes. If things are too small or too light in color in comparison to their background, I can\u2019t see them at all. So in conclusion, I\u2019m very thankful for my glasses.",
            "My dad didn't know he needed glasses until he was about 35. I won tickets through school to a charity football game between Liverpool and Chelsea I think it was. Hilarious because I never had any interest in sports, especially football, but everyone in my class had to enter the competition... Anyway, we had front row seats but he joked that even that close he couldn't see anything. I told him to put my glasses on as a joke and he was just like \"oh shit, I need to get my eyes tested!\" Turns out he shouldn't have been driving without glasses!",

            "The reverse question is fascinating. What completely normal downside to everyday life will a person in 2820 just *equip* away?",

            "I was in 3rd grade, sitting at the dinner table and mom said look at that cow laying down under the tree. And I said....what cow?  A week later I had my first pair of glasses.",
            "Before 1268, only a relatively small portion of the population had to read on a daily basis, and just about nobody had to read at a distance (street signs that aren't pictographic, blackboards in class, etc.).  If called upon to use ranged weaponry such as a bow or crossbow, their deficient accuracy might be put down to poor eyesight, but that's all.  If you did have to read (say you were a monk or high-ranking servant who kept accounts - a noble would simply get a servant to read and write for them if needed), there were a number of crude lens arrangements that could be used in a pinch, even if they weren't proper magnifying glasses or eyewear.  It wouldn't affect transportation as much as in the age of the automobile because the horse, donkey or oxen will also see whatever obstacle is there and instinctively avoid it as long as you're not going flat out.\n\nWe can't directly compare how things look very easily.  If everything beyond 10 feet is blurry to you for your whole life... you're going to assume that's the case for everyone else, too.  And it's not going to come up very often.\n\nAlso, the prevalence of nearsightedness and farsightedness in modern populations shows strong correlation with amount of outdoor activity by children aged 10 and younger.  I have yet to read a clear explanation of *why* this matters, but the bottom line is that you are much more likely to need glasses if you spend most of your free time before age 10 indoors rather than out.  Note that it doesn't matter how much or what you read, whether you watch TV, computer, or mobile device screens, or anything like that, just that you spend enough hours outdoors... at least as far as the data we have that I have read.  I doubt that was as prevalent of a statistic in the middle ages, either, so there were probably a lot fewer people with the disorder to begin with, as well as it being less of an issue for their lifestyle.",
            "It's complicated.  Myopia is genetic, but it worsens with doing things that are close, and over time.  Reading, sewing, ect.  If we never had to read, if we never had to spend hours and hours and hours focusing intently on a screen 3 feet from our faces, our eyesight wouldn't be as bad.  It would take years to get to the point of actual blindness.  My grandfather was illiterate due to undaignosed myopia, but he could see well enough to live his life, driving and farming/ranching.  My father went to school and now in his 60's he's finally reached the same level as me.  Glasses won't actually correct my vision anymore, after about 10 feet everything is fuzzy, and without glasses the world is a vast field of colorful floating blobs.  For example trees are just a vast green shape.  I can hear the rustle of the wind, but not see any movement unless the whole tree is swaying in a tornado wind.  I grew up in the information age, and was reading by age 5, at 12 I got a commodore computer.  My vision is markedly worse then anyone else in my family.\n\nWe do have a superpower though!  Try on a pair of reading glasses next time you want to look at something up close instead of looking over your glasses.  It's amazing the fine level of detail we can see as our upclose vision is very very good.",
            "Life was pretty fuckin brutal those days. A little blurry vision? Your fine! Your brothers got no legs!",
            "Back in 8th grade, a lot of my math/science class needed glasses new/replaced and the teacher just let kids sit in the front in the floor to help is see the board, so there would sometimes be 5-10 kids all just crowded up the front like kindergarteners. He was a cool wacky teacher.",

After I got them, I was walking around and grabbed my partner and said, \"Wait. You're supposed to be able to see the leaves on the tree from like over here??\u201d I just always assumed things only looked rendered when you got close to them, like in a video game.\n\nI thought video games were just trying to be realistic by being that blurry.",

            "as someone who has worn glass most of my life I think about that. I think that the availability of glasses made it easier for people who needed them to live long enough to reproduce and be part of society. Maybe we got weeded out sooner in the old days and/or nearsightedness was a lot less prevalent.\n\nI always read/hear about how every kid in medieval england was required to be long bow proficient... wonder what happened to the kids who couldnt see shit.\n\nI think they got killed a lot easier in an already brutal environment and not as many people in general needed glasses.",
            "I have pretty bad nearsightedness. I've had the thought that if I had been born before corrective lenses, something in my environment would have made short work of me. Eaten by an animal, fallen and hurt myself, picked the wrong mushroom, bit by that snake I couldn't see.  I would have been a victim of survival of the fittest.",

            "**They squinted.** The squint is related to a phenomenon used by kids who want to view a solar eclipse. I'm talking of a pinhole camera. A small hole allows light to enter in, and without a lens it has 1:1 magnification (none; no diopters). However, the effect is that you can obtain a focused image due to the small aperture.\n\nIn photography, small apertures are used on virtually all point-and-shoot cameras to obtain a field of view in which everything is in focus, from about 4 feet to infinity.\n\nBy squinting your eyes, you can increase the focus of things ... 1 meter to infinity ... because optics. The downside is obviously light-gathering power. A small aperture (or squint) will block out most of the light entering the lens, whether it's a pinhole \"air\" lens or the lens of the eye. Try it and see.\n\n**Bonus trick: Another trick is to make your own pinhole camera with your fingers, usually a tightly curled forefinger. Hold it in front of your best eye, and enjoy focused images. It's like a poor-man's (Dark Ages) telescope.**",

I was diagnosed with cancer in early 2018, and pretty quickly got sick of all the \"everything happens for a reason\" type comments. Or like, the implication that I must have done something wrong for it to happen to me.\n\nBut eventually, partway through treatment, I came to terms with the fact that existence is totally random and chaotic and nothing means anything. And that's great, honestly, because all of this garbage that's happening to me is meaningless. I don't need to find a deeper meaning to life because of it; sometimes bad things just happen to people. It sucks but it's just how it goes.\n\nI'm better now, by the way.

People have written a *lot* about it - there's a whole type of philosophy called existentialism that attempts to deal with this question of the cosmic irrelevance and randomness of existence. Some embrace meaninglessness (nihilism), others try to justify a purpose, others submit to the absurdity of it all (absurdism). You might like some of their answers, or none, it doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things after all. :)",

Along with all of the other items people have listed, one thing that lot of homeless people really miss is human contact as people will generally avoid this when interacting with them and it's noticeable.

Even non homeless people can have a problem with the cost, or just are miserable on their periods regardless. So, i can't imagine being on the streets having to deal with that",

            "I think that one thing people don't realize about homelessness is that it's self perpetuating. Without a stable place to get your mail, receive calls and clean up there are so many things that are effectively impossible to do. Maybe letting a homeless person use your mailbox, making sure they have a phone, even if it's prepay, a place to shower and nice clothes for interviews.\n\nSome homeless people suffer from mental disorders. If you see someone who seems like they may be a danger to themselves or others or don't seem to be in the best state of mind to make decisions DON'T CALL THE COPS. Most cities have outreach programs, call one of these and ask for advice/assistance.\n\nFinally, give your time to supporting causes, philosophies and political initiatives that work toward more inclusive societies, easy to access social safety nets and believe that all people are entitled to basic dignity and quality of life simply on account of being human beings.\n\nRemember that above all other factors resulting in homelessness is the simple fact that we live in societies that allow some people to benefit off of vast amounts of inequality and the suffering of others. The degree to which we could work to rein that in, to upend the notion that rich makes right, to cast doubt on the commonly held belief that there needs to be the fear of losing everything to motivate people to be their best, and to increase our empathy for the plight of others, maybe we can hope to create a better future for everyone.",

            "As a former homeless person, I would have greatly appreciated a travel sized hygiene kit. Granted there are a lot of people who will take offense to that, but the ones who appreciate it are the ones trying to get a job.\n\nAlso, it will go a lot smoother if you give them something else with it, like socks.\n\nUltimately, there's no real end all to be all gift, but when you decide to give something to them, listen carefully to what they're saying, and keep in mind the current and up coming weather. In the US, a bottle of water isn't really a good gift because they can get free water from most fast food places. \n\nIf you're in a city, don't give them top brand items either because it makes them a target to thieves and other less honorable homeless people. Discount or 2nd hand items or items from Goodwill (again, US, since I don't have a lot if experience with other countries) are good places to go for most items, since they will shop from those places anyways, if they had the money.",
            "Formerly homeless here. I was more of a traveling, barefoot, hippie type homeless person, but I can confirm socks are a definitely well-received. Socks, underwear, little snacks that can be tucked away for later. It's summer right now, but those handwarmer and footwarmer pack things are great if you live anywhere it gets cold. Maybe a nalgene or easy-to-carry bottle to keep water in. If you're trying to help anyone in particular, maybe you could ask them if their tent (or wherever they live) is staying dry. They might need a tarp which can be purchased some places for only a few bucks. Man, I've been off the road for a while now. I wish I could think of some more ideas. A nice smile and kind words are always accepted! And please.... if you ever encounter a rude, ungrateful homeless person, don't assume that the majority are the same way. Thank you for wanting to help others!",
            "I'm not an expert, but I do donate to individual homeless quite a bit.  I suggest straight up asking what that person needs.  I do that, and here's what I've found:\n\n* If they have a dog, ask if the dog needs decent food or, if it's winter, a coat.  These folks don't have the money to buy good stuff, but their pet is their entire family.  They want them to be taken care of.\n* If it's winter, overwhelmingly they ask for hand warmers.  I buy them on clearance in the spring to hand out in the winter.\n* A bus pass is typically welcomed.  Transportation is a real issue so it helps to have that in hand.\n*  Decent outerwear in cold months (can you tell I live in Michigan?).  I made a guy cry once by giving him super warm gloves.  His had two fingers missing on his and it was FREEZING outside.\n*  A hamburger.  Do you know how hard it is to get a decent hot meal for them?\n*  Offer to have dinner/meal with them if you have time.  Just being treated like a real human being is appreciated.\n\nUnderstand that cash is going to go to what *they* want.  Some will spend it on food or housing.  Others on meth.  That's honestly their choice and you just need to accept that.  However, if you have a few homeless in an area, get to know them and ask about them.  They will tell you who the good guys are and who will just go buy a rock with anything they get.\n\nAlso, if you give things like food or even gift certs, you need to be mindful of their situation.  Do they have a place to cook the food?  Do they have transportation to get to that store?",

DAYS go by and he gets up the courage to check and see, says hello loudly a few times before he entered and found a dead body (days dead) with a needle still in his arm. He took that needle put it in his arm and took what was left, claimed the tent for himself and told the police that he found a dead body from an OD. They did not ask about who owns the tent. Took the body and gave him the info for our shelter. It's kinda BS that those who used drugs are always put in the AA program but I bet it is about cost.

You\u2019d be surprised how many vegetarian homeless people there are), socks, tampons, pads, first aid equipment (bandaids, Neosporin), deodorant, toothpaste, toothbrush, vitamins, paper towels/napkins, dog food (a lot of homeless people have dogs!), wipes, granola bars... this isn\u2019t a physical object, but taking someone to a laundromat and getting all their stuff washed is a great thing to do, as is paying for or giving them haircuts/shave. Right now healthcare stuff like masks, gloves, hand sanitizer. Handouts/information about organizations that can help them and directions for how to get there. Prepaid transit cards. Cash!\n\nAt our clinics we have nail painting. It\u2019s important to see a human being\u2014someone who has tastes, likes and dislikes, vanities. Quite often we talk about basic needs but its almost dehumanizing to strip a person to their basic needs, which is why its great to ask. Maybe they would love a used book, a new eyeliner, a piece of jewelry.",
            "There are usually a lot of places where someone experiencing homelessness can get the essentials they need like clothes and toothpaste. \nThe best thing you can give a homeless person is money, money gives them the freedom to go buy a hot meal, or a drink to help themselves go to sleep, or drugs for recreation. I know none of you will agree with me but I think it\u2019s more important to give someone homeless the opportunity to do with the money what is best for themselves. And if what is best for themselves is a lil bit of smack, or a bed at the backpackers, well that\u2019s their choice.",

            "When I was homeless and living in my car, the two items I yearned most for were:\n\n1) Waterless shampoo. There were times when it wasn\u2019t feasible to find/use a truck stop shower service. Sometimes my instincts told me not to go near certain public showers. As a woman, living in my car was a constant mix of terror and boredom. Waterless shampoo would have helped me feel better, without risking my life to get clean. \n\n2) Books or entertainment of any sort. When faced with both terror and boredom, the worst thing to endure was surprisingly the boredom. Long hours spent in a Walmart parking lot or well-populated campsite lot could be dangerous in a different way. After just a few weeks of homelessness, I understood intimately why many in my situation turn to alcohol or drugs\u2014 time was insufferably slow after I got off work and had nothing to look forward to. I was never comfortable in the back of my car, and always alert for trouble. As the reality of my situation sunk in, it became more difficult to avoid the temptation to drown my sorrows. The only thing that kept me focused on a better future was the conviction that, if I crossed that line and turned to drugs, this would be my life forever. \n\nI had a few books with me, and read them obsessively, until there was no more light to see by. *Shantaram by Gregory David Roberts* was the book I read over and over, because it helped put my own situation in perspective and gave me the courage to fight for a better future. It made me thankful I was homeless in the US, instead of somewhere worse. \n\nI was homeless for just under four months before I had the bare minimum $$ to make a cross-country move. I was freshly out of an extremely abusive relationship... one that took longer than I\u2019d like to admit to finally leave. \n\n**That I willingly chose homelessness over living with him says more about it than a lengthy paragraph would.**\n\nHe tried like hell to intimidate me back and, when that didn\u2019t work, he resorted to threats and stalking. Because of his abusive voicemails, slow-crawl passes, and eerily accurate information on my location, I moved around often\u2014 sometimes multiple times a day\u2014 and always overnighted in public places. He waged a fear campaign with surprise visits and constant threats that nearly drove me into a breakdown. \n\nI lived in a constant state of high alert, bordering on panic, and it took years to process and put those instincts to rest after I moved across the country. I used to flash back to that period in my life frequently, but it hasn\u2019t happened in a while. \n\nThe chance to leave it all behind was the best decision I ever made. I don\u2019t normally advocate for running from your problems... but, in this instance and despite the hardship, it worked out well for me.",
            "I've worked with the homeless for the better part of a decade in Austin, Tx. When you see someone on the corner \"flying a sign\" at an intersection your best bet is ready made bag. Get a 1 gallon ziplock bag and fill it with the following:\n\nsocks, water bottle, granola bar of some sort, crackers and cheese, hand sanitizer, toiletries (hotel toiletries work perfect so stock up on those whenever you travel), pocket bible, pack of wet wipes, Kleenex, ect\n\nThe idea here is small items that won't go bad sitting in your car. usually someone flying a sign will be really thankful. Alternatively, you might find out real fast that they have food, water, and just need some money for drugs or alcohol. I've had some homeless throw the bag back into my car or literally throw it away in front of me. DON'T GET DISCOURAGED most have mental health issues.\n\nNow if you are wanting to visit some homeless under a bridge or somewhere in your town where they are know to congregate I suggest going in a group. Maybe buy some breakfast sandwiches and coffee and go on a Saturday and just be with them. Just talking and being in community is HUGE. I can't even begin to tell you how sad it is for people who feel \"INVISIBLE\" and haven't been touched in a long time.....I'm talking not even a handshake.\n\nHope this helps",
            "I invite them to lunch and ask them what they need. Lead the conversation away from money. Underwear, socks, coats, food, tent, propane stove? I always keep a box of hand warmers in the truck. I pass them out and run through the drive-through and grab a bag of burgers.\n\nBefore the winter comes here in Detroit I start my hunt for the truly needy. I usually wait until the temps start dropping, that's when the people who are just trying to score some panhandling cash start bailing from the street corners. I find the ones that are still around and take them for a meal and get the real deal. \n\nAll of them ask for money, but money trouble got them where they are. Body wipes are great, deodorant, toothbrushes, travel bottles of shampoo. Nothing extravagant, sometimes they get robbed while sleeping or held at gunpoint if somebody sees them with something of value. \n\n [https://www.amazon.com/Cobra-Products-PST154-4-Way-Sillcock/dp/B0002YVMEM/ref=sr\\_1\\_15?dchild=1&keywords=water+shutoff+tool&qid=1594309018&sr=8-15](https://www.amazon.com/Cobra-Products-PST154-4-Way-Sillcock/dp/B0002YVMEM/ref=sr_1_15?dchild=1&keywords=water+shutoff+tool&qid=1594309018&sr=8-15) \n\nThis sillcock key will turn the water spicket on for most municipal building exterior water valves.

Most of them are just down on their luck and don't know how to get out. Sometimes they're fixated on a single problem and if you can break that cycle with them they turn their lives around. \n\nThese three are a couple of examples of what they needed. 2/3 were in a better place before COVID. \n\nJames needed his bike back after he got hit by a car so he could start working. It was at a local shop that was holding it for payment. I called the shop and made the payment. We then filled out a job application and we got him working as a custodian for a church. He calls me every month to let me know how he's doing. He lives with his daughter now.\n\nSarah was trying to get into a shelter and AA to get clean but she couldn't find shelter with space. We called around until we found her a program and got her in. I didn't think I would be a good sponsor, so I got in touch with the minister. She's back living with her parents now and has been clean since December. At least before lockdown. I've not had contact since. I pray she's still doing good.\n\nTrain (that's the only name he'd give me) struggles with PTSD from his time in the military and doesn't feel comfortable in shelters. He needed warm clothes and a few things to make it through the winter. I went shopping with his list of clothes from the Salvation Army and camping gear, then spent Thanksgiving with him at his bus stop. 2 full dinners from KFC (buy one get one free on Thanksgiving!). He was very standoffish and defensive. I spent a lot of time trying to get him to trust me to help him. I think he'd been taken advantage of and left in a worse situation. I brought him hot coffee on the cold days. He disappeared back in January. I still have a pair of boots in my truck I picked up for him. I called all the shelters and while none of them will tell me if he's there, they will usually tell me if they've seen him at some point.",

They were really nice.  Next time I saw them, they gave me a dollar store gift card (I think it was like 25$ or something).  This was great, because I was able to buy batteries for my flashlight, an emergency blanket, new (albeit basic) tarp for my tent, shampoo/soap, some basic food (canned tuna/salmon, crackers, sports drinks, etc), and other little stuff that I really needed at a lower cost.  Not saying this would help everyone, but it really helped me out at the time.",
            "I'm a 40 yr old man living in New England. Last year I ended up homeless for the first time in my life. It was around the beginning of October. I was homeless up until mid march. I lived in a shelter for the first month. It was a violent place and many of my belongings were stolen. Losing my cell phone compounded all my problems. By November i left and choose to live out of the train station as it was much safer and surprisingly more peaceful even though millions of people passed through. Eventually i ended up in a better shelter across the state but still struggled. After an altercation I ended up on the street again. Always cold, sometimes wet, rarely showered and not the cleanest of clothes. My whole life had to fit in one backpack that I could rarely take off for fear of theft. When sleeping I had to tie it to my leg or arm.\n\nHow to help? Socks, flavored drink packets, energy/protein bars, a gym membership for a month to shower, a haircut, shoes, money, an offer to drive to job interviews, tokens for the the laundry mart.\n\nIf your worried about how the money will be spent a gift card is a really stupid idea. If they are going to spend it on alcohol or drugs they will just sell the gift card. Gift cards sell for half the value. If you give a $20 card some drug dealer or asshole will buy it for $10. Half the money will go to a random person and the homeless person will still buy their alcohol or drugs only they will do it with $10 of your money.\n\nSometimes it takes time to get into rehab. Alcoholics will get sick and can die without a drink.\nBeing homeless is aweful, difficult, hopelessness thrives, everything is a struggle, suffering is rampant and coping is almost impossible. So what if they buy a bottle. If you were them you would want to escape your reality sometimes too, even if it was only for a night. \n\nOn my last day homeless I got lucky through the help of a compassionate organization and a random meeting with a person that rented rooms.\nI was literally walking across my city tired, depressed and without any hope. As I was walking I was looking at the bridge visible a couple miles away. I was struggling with a decision.  Was I going to jump of the bridge or go to the police station and break a few windows to get locked up? Kill myself or go to jail for a warm, safer, place with food, showers, a bed, medical care, and the possibility that I could get some assistance through the courts that would get me into some type of housing even if it was DOC housing. And in that moment I was given a room and 2 weeks rent paid. Then I got my stimulus check and found a job before it ran out.",

            "I was homeless once. Homeless people are individuals, of course. But giving them a Christmas present or something to acknowledge any other holiday is something most homeless people haven\u2019t experienced in years. Most homeless people don\u2019t have enough to eat, either. Even the ones who are staying in shelters don\u2019t get three meals a day very often. You can give them non-perishable food and if you really want to make their day buy them a meal from a fast food restaurant. A lot of times when you\u2019re lying in your shelter bed, unable to sleep because you\u2019re hungry you\u2019re fantasizing about how wonderful it would be to have a big, juicy cheeseburger or some KFC just one more time. You can give them a can opener so they\u2019ll have access to more non-perishable things. You can give them grooming supplies. You can give women makeup or hair care supplies because they probably don\u2019t have any. You can give them clothes or shoes that they can be seen in public in and maintain some dignity. You can give them a ride around town to see the fall foliage, Christmas lights, spring flowers, etc. Blankets are good. You can also buy them a bottle of Tylenol, Pepto-Bismol, etc. because homeless people don\u2019t have those things so when they\u2019re sick or in pain they don\u2019t usually have a thing to take for it. If you\u2019re really feeling generous you can take a homeless person to get an eye exam and a pair of glasses. Some homeless people can\u2019t see much of what\u2019s going on around them because they need glasses that they can\u2019t get. You can take them to get a haircut from a stylist, which a lot of homeless people haven\u2019t had in years and is another human dignity issue.

            "Not saying these are 'the best' - just some that I haven't spotted in the thread yet that have been popular with homeless people we've known, which is quite a few of them as I often interview them for some work I do:\n\nIf you have an old mobile phone that you have no use for, the sort that just needs a sim to activate, wipe it, charge it up, wrap a charger around it and stick it in your backpack.  We've given away most of our old phones to homeless people we've known; often they already have a sim or can get one panhandling for cash, but their phones are broken and worn out, and an upgrade is always useful (especially if the battery is better). Also, MP3 players.  Even better if you see them regularly and can stick music they like on there.\n\nSmall battery packs, the sort you can recharge USB devices on.  I once got lucky on a Staples sale and got a load for a buck each, and they went like hot cakes.  \n\nFor when things open up again in terms of restaurants; gift cards to places like McDonalds, or whatever the local 24 hour fast food place is.  A $10 mcdonalds gift card means 10 items from the value menu, so ten visits.  You can spend up to half an hour there after buying something before you get kicked out, and they have wifi.  And the bathrooms are usually decent.\n\n7-11 gift cards are also good - a large slushie is good for cooling down in the heat, when you can't go inside, they're open 24/7, and do cheap hot food.  In summer, cold bottles of water are usually appreciated.  I had one homeless friend who would stop by every time he was passing and saw me outside and get me to fill his canteen up with ice cubes and tap water.  People kind of think of the hardships of winter when they think of homelessness, but summer can be hell if you can't get out of the heat. \n\nClothing-wise - hoodies, rain jackets, coats, hats, both summer and winter.  Boots/ shoes.  In the winter, gloves, scarves.  Also, women's clothes.  \n\nTrash bags, paper towels, toilet paper, wet wipes, toothbrush and toothpaste. Duck tape is also popular.\n\nOld but good backpacks.  Often homeless people's gear is falling apart, and a decent backpack, even a second hand one that you've washed (can even put a few useful things in the pockets) is very useful.\n\nLast but not least, money.  I know, we're conditioned never to give homeless people money.  But sometimes they need to do laundry, or get a bus ticket, or make a pay phone call, and $5 can be a lot more helpful than socks, if you are utterly out of cash.  \n\n*Laundry - more of a side note as it's not just a gift it's a service! If you have homeless people around your home that you see regularly, and already chat to/ have a rapport with, then one of the nicest things you can do is offer them the use of your washing machine.  I kind of looked after a little group of homeless guys summer before last (they've moved on now), and once a week or so I'd do about four loads of laundry for them.  It saved them a lot on coin machines and detergent, and also I could get them cleaner than a crappy launderette.  I gave them a roll of sturdy trash bags, and they'd drop them off full of clothes that were dumped straight in the machine with double detergent, washed twice on hot, then tumble dried.  Then I'd fold them and put them in a new trash bag (because another thing homeless people can ALWAYS use, it's trash bags). Over time the loads got larger and larger; went from one guy to about four of them in the end!  They were camping in the woods so it was hard to keep clothes clean.*",

Homelessness, prisons, suicides, cronic depression and anxiety everywhere and we still deny the mental health crisis around us."

            "In the post- World War 2 economic boom, houses began to be built very fast and very inexpensively,  due to better manufacturing processes and high demand. As time went on, they were built ever more inexpensively, until the 90s and 2000s when they began being built (in my opinion) dangerously inexpensive for what they are. They were intended primarily for the first owner, who will eventually upgrade, and not for longevity. \nFarmed timber was also grown faster and faster, leading to less dense wood. Modern houses are often built with thin steel studs, instead of wood 2x4s.\nPre war houses are built significantly stronger. My 1937 house has a combo of cement board and drywall nearly an inch thick, and 16 inch spacing knot the studs, solid wood doors, etc. It is VERY stout, to the point that it's difficult to shout between rooms.

            "Wood houses can and do last more than 100 years, there are many original colonial homes built in the US that are still standing with proper maintenance. Rock and brick are strong, but bad ideas in areas with seismic activity (cause they are brittle). For that reason, many places don't allow new building with masonry (new buildings that appear to be masonry is a facade over lumber (for homes) or steel (for large commercial buildings)).\n\nAmerican homes are very strong, they just aren't build to withstand a head-on collision from a pickup truck. And when people came to this land of massive freakin forests they had choices: dig up a bunch of rocks to built homes, or head over and cut down a couple trees.\n\nMany early homes actually *were* built with stone here. It's very common to find old 100-200 year old farm houses in the US because farmers would use the stones they plowed out of their fields to build their homes.\n\nBut as for some of the materials people complain about, here are the advantages:\n\n* Wood: cheap, and easy to get straight-ish pieces of lumber from the abundant pine trees we have here\n* Gypsum sheetrock/drywall: again cheap, cheaper than plastic, and used as a fire barrier, plus easy to patch and repair\n* OSB/plywood: cheap, and even the cheaper OSB crap provides great shear strength when used as cladding outside the lumber framing.\n* Tar-based roofing shingles: You guessed it, cheaper than clay tiles or whatever the hell you richies use! But does a decent job of keeping the weather out for 15-20 years per roof, and doesn't shatter when hail hits it, and stays in place with several centimeters of snow load.\n\nWhat I won't defend:\n\n* Alternating current was born here (by an immigrant, like all great things were!), but yeah 220v was a better idea, we shoulda joined you guys for 220v residential mains.\n* We have dumb power receptacles.

It is more forgiving of errors / can be repaired cheaply and easily (comparatively speaking), which means it requires less skilled labor.\n5. It\u2019s lighter and easier to transport than stone or brick (part of why it got started since wood was abundant and easy to get locally or transport on the river). \n6. Parts can be pre-assembled and shipped (pre-fabricated housing).\n7. It allows insulating the house, which makes the temperature inside more controlled to hot/cold. The air gap and insulation materials are better at insulating than thick stone or brick.\n8. Renovating and changing parts of it later is simpler and easier.\n\nThat said, they aren\u2019t that easy to break and do last very well. You act like houses are worthless unless they last many hundreds  of years with next to no repairs. That\u2019s not always or even often a requirement.

America was a heavily forested in a lot of places before colonization. Many people who settled america were poor, so the cheapest material available was used. That history influenced a lot of our building practices \n\nSettlers used to make sod houses out of cut squares of topsoil, until they could afford a cheap wood house and barns.\n\nThere are stone and brick houses around today, but most of them are older, and were built by affluent people. Concrete is used in some housing, a lot of government building (like schools), and in the foundations of houses.\n\nSecondly, America has a *lot* of crazy weather.\n\nYou don't get a lot of earthquakes and tornadoes in the UK or much of Europe.\n\nTornadoes can occur in much of the US. Earthquakes are very common on the west coast.\n\nWhy build a stone or brick house if there's a chance it could be destroyed year after year after year, and you need to rebuild at a costly expense?\n\nIn the gulf coast (and some east coast cities), some people build brick and stone houses because they feel it is more durable when it floods. Other people build their houses on stilts to avoid floodwaters, and only wood is light enough to be built on stilts. \n\nEither way, the cost to rebuild or repair a damaged home is a lot cheaper for wood housing.\n\nThirdly, its convenient and still widely accessible. Wood and plaster/drywall housing is incredibly versatile, relatively cheap to renovate, and useful for all the other aspects that are needed to make a house work.\n\nYou can build a house out of wood and drywall in the coldest part of the US, and fill the hollow walls with insulation and it is far warmer than any stone house.\n\nYou bought an old house, and don't like its layout? You can completely tear down everything but the support beams and rebuild the inside to fit your needs for a decent price, especially compared to the cost of renovating stone. \n\nOr, you have a large family, and need to build additional space onto your house?

Theres really no incentive for homeowners to spend so much to make a solid house made from purely cinderblocks, bricks and stone when you can reduce cost significantly by using lumber and drywall. Most homes in the US arent built to last centuries, the lifespan of an average home is between half a century to a century unless there's massive efforts to renovate and maintain a house, specifically structural lumber in the home. Usually we just tear the house down and build a newer house with modern materials and technologies.\n\nThere are extremely old houses in the US, especially on the east coast where the home was either made during colonial times and are built like how Europeans built homes with stones and bricks or they're historical buildings that are preserved like old plantation houses. So in cities like Boston, Philly, DC, Williamsburg you'll find those houses still around.",
            "All depends where you live and what environmental conditions you face. \n\nLots of Brick, stone and concrete homes (especially in the North East. \n\nIn a location where there\u2019s lots of tornadoes. These types of homes will kill more people, and be more expensive to rebuild.",
            "Modern houses are not designed for big heavy things to crash into them. That\u2019s a very infrequent occurrence that is better handled by having a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy to pay for repairs. \n\nHouses are designed for being well insulated and cheaper to produce. Homeowners deal with mortgage payments and heating/cooling bills wvery month, so these things are higher priorities. \n\nAs others have said the wood framing structure of modern houses is good for a very long time, over a century. And in a century people moght have vastly different preferences for what they want in a house.",
            "And yet houses last, some even still standing from over a century ago. If a home is well maintained, it can last a very long time. \n\nHomes don't need much unless you live in an area with natural disasters and even then, you're better off using cheaper material as a tornado or severe flood is still going to destroy a home. \n\nAmerican uses usually don't just use wood, but brick and concrete. It's mostly wood because it's everywhere in America, it's cheaper, and despite the stereotype, it last just as long as other building materials. Thanks for building codes and architectural standards, American homes last just as long. \n\nBut yes, a plane crashing into a home will destroy it, in America, or anywhere.",

            "A lot of people are listing cheapness and abundance of wood as the diffinitive reason why, and those are 2 very good reasons, but I'd argue insulation and flexibility are equally as important. I'm sure you know, but stone, brick, and concrete are fucking terrible insulators. You can still add additional insulation, but that stone or whatever is still going to leach heat like crazy. Flexibility is also fairly important in the US because we generally have more ground movement which in stone or brick houses can potentially be a catastrophic issue, whereas with wood frame you probably won't even notice. Also as long as you have a properly installed hardiboard, treated wood, or brick siding you really shouldn't have to worry about your house deteriorating. You're house doesn't need to stand up to a siege or anything, so idk what you mean by weak. A properly built house of any material isn't going to just fall down because you lean on it or anything.",
            "OP, I think you ask the question with genuine curiosity. I think the best answer is you build the best house with the materials available for the environment at hand. Historically lumber is/was so abundant in the US that it makes sense to design houses around this material. But I have seen houses built out of actual solid logs (log cabin), cinderblock outer walls with wood interior (hurricane states like FL) and what we call conventional stick frame (what you are probably thinking of as flimsy). Believe it or not, with modern engineering methods a stick frame house and engineered trusses can be very very strong and both environmentally and cost efficient. There are already millions of homes that have lasted more than a generation and house construction has only gotten better.",

In Japan, it is expected that houses will be rebuilt every 20-30 years. In America, it is somewhere in between.\n\nIt is also regional within America. Some regions build to last, others will build for an even shorter term.

            "The answer is complicated. First one is practical: Europe doesn't have frequent tornados. It's more efficient to rebuild a wooden house. \n\nOther reason is cultural: America has the pioneer/settler culture of moving on to a new place. Europe in that time was already densily populated and urbanised. Europe used to build wooden houses as well, but after huge fires stone became obligatory. There's simply more space in the US to build, so aside from coastal cities, building in stone isn't needed.",

USA is a relatively young nation, and when the first settlers came here from England and other nations a few hundred years ago and truly started exploding in population, the landscape of USA was trees. Trees fucking EVERYWHERE. Perhaps bricks and like materials weren't readily available in those early days? I figure with all that lumber just waiting to be harvested, the business of building with wood became huge business, and with that being such a powerhouse in early American economy, they weren't going to let it die.

            "Where I live (Nebraska), wood construction is the norm, and yes, it lasts. We have wooden houses that are well over 100 years old.\n\nThe reason we use wood is because brick and stone are prohivitively expensive. The bedrock here is limestone which is not great for building. Brick and concrete are a little easier to get, but they too need to be shipped in from quite a ways away. So we restrict them to where it matters most: the foundation.\n\nIt all comes down to maintenance! The key to preserving wood is keeping it dry. So as long as the roof and siding are in good condition, the structure of the house will hold up fine.\n\nThere are downsides, of course. Hanging things on your wall is a whole \"thing\" because either you have to locate the nearest wooden stud, or you have to use a drywall anchor, for anything heavier than a poster. And yes, it's possible to put your fist (or a knife, or a doorknob) through a wall if you use enough force. On the other hand, drywall is easy to patch and fix. It's easy to open up if you want to run new wire or pipes through it. It's easy to completely remove and change walls around, provided they're not loadbearing. And wifi and radio signals go straight through them, so reception is good.",

            "[Balloon framing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_(construction)#Balloon_framing).\n\nEurope cut down most of its forests for fuel and framing by the late Renaissance, so mason construction became favored.\n\nAs America was colonized beyond the Appalachian mountains in the early 19th century, stone quarries were rare, but softwood like pine was abundant. Past the Mississippi, there's just open grassland, most materials had to be shipped in.\n\nBalloon framing has some advantages, like lower cost/weight of building materials, high resilience to earthquakes, less humidity from moisture in walls, and easy modification. Its's spread to much of the world for temperate climate single-family housing. Tropical climates, it tends to rot.\n\nIt also has disadvantages. Little fire/flood resilience. Little thermal inertia, which keeps interiors cooler at daytime and warmer at night.",

Older homes that were less efficient could get away with being built poorly because these lower standards also inadvertently allowed for the structure to dry out in the event of some moisture intrusion.",

You can call those \u201cnormal\u201d loads or events that the structure needs to resist or hold up to. Things that houses are NOT designed for is a 6000 pound car hitting walls at 50 miles an hour. If we built houses to withstand this, they would be 10x the normal cost. Things like brick and concrete are hard to build with because they are heavy and need to be held up by something, and even a brick house will come crashing down if it\u2019s hit by a car.

            "I work in the film industry, let me explain what I think is happening.\n\nWhen the film is being shot, there really isn\u2019t a difference light level wise (we use the term F-stop) than when films were being shot 50-80 years ago, everything is lit to around 2-5 f-stop. What you are referring to when it seams too dark happens in post-production. There is someone called a \u2018colorist\u2019,  they are responsible for coloring, recoloring, darkening and brightening the image. These colorist are working with the raw 4-6k footage and editing on thousand of dollar monitors in perfect conditions. If they take it a bit darker in their environment, it definitely looks great and properly lit to them. \nThe problem arises when these images are exported through cable or the internet and you then view it on your much cheaper tv, laptop, or phone in a less than ideal environment.\nIf you were to watch these shows in a movie theater like environment it would be a much different experience.\n\nI am aggravated how these multimillion dollar productions aren\u2019t accounting for what their viewers are watching the show on. And how one-two people can effect the entire viewership experience.\n\nEdit: a couple comments pointing out the confusion in my wording around F-stop. As other comments have mention f-stop does not determine exposure. However in the industry we light in accordance to the f-stop(or t-stop) that the cinematographer wants for the scene. \n\nFor instance the cinematographer might want the subjects at a 2.8 with the background at a 2. Because iso is not really touched, the lighting control we have is with the lights and ND filters",
            "I\u2019m going to say that it\u2019s because cheap CGI is easier to hide in the dark. And my source for this just Alien Vs Predator 2. That whole movie was so dark I have no idea what it was about. (But it looked like shit!)",
            "Daredevil was unwatchable for me. Like I get it, bro is blind and they\u2019re playing with lighting in the settings to highlight that, but fucking Christ, why is my bedroom at midnight when I\u2019m trying to sleep brighter than the court room in broad daylight? Do they not have *windows?* Did they let the power bill lapse?",
            "Facts! I hate this sm. I have poor vision and also have very little depth perception. It makes me real sad when I can\u2019t tell what\u2019s going on because it\u2019s so dark.\n\nAnd man, I love daredevil, and I know that the darkness is supposed to be symbolic bc matt is blind, BUT I CANT FUCKING TELL WHATS GOING ON. There are a million other shows/movies that do this but this came to mind first.\n\nOne good thing about animated shows and movies are that they rarely do this. They\u2019re generally a bit brighter/clearer.\n\nIn conclusion, for all of you filmmakers: pls stop making your shows/movies so dark my vision is bad :(",

            "You're not alone. This jerkoff practice totally fucking ticks me off. Television shows are supposed to be enjoyable light entertainment (no stupid pun intended) and not puzzle palaces in which you try desperately to glean the slightest clue as to what the hell is happening in all that interminable gloom.\n\nI'm currently binge-watching House M.D. again, and if you've seen it, you may have noticed how absolutely *everything* is gloomy and dark in the last season. Brightly lit hospital corridors are gloomy and shadowed. Even walking around outside in broad daylight in the summertime with nary a cloud in the sky is lighted *down* like everyone's in a fucking enormous haunted house.\n\nAnd of course we all know the clusterfuck that is the final battle of Game of Thrones. Honestly, why even have lighting? Why not film the whole fucking thing at midnight in an open country field with the actors stumbling around and banging into each other at random? For that matter, why not just display a totally dark screen throughout and record the sound effects separately? That'll save a *bundle* on actor salaries and the cost of generating random, flickering CGI effects and result in much the same incredibly annoying, non-informative cinematic experience. -\\_-\n\n(Minor edits: Spelling, grammar, and semantic clarity.)",

Our television has intelligent dynamic contrast tweaking options but it just makes it worse.

            "Style and editing choices are probably a lot of it, but I think quite a bit still might be from streaming compression. In particular, it can lead to what is called \"black crush\", where all of the darker shades of black/grey blend together and look uniform. This causes a huge loss of detail in dark scenes that should otherwise look clear. Some screens aren't the best for this either, even many modern UHD (4K) TVs can still struggle with this. I'd suggest looking up your particular model of TV for reviews, in particular pay attention to contrast and dark/black performance. I got my old Samsung F8500 specifically for this.",

            "It's the exact same for me but not on my phone though only on my TV so when I am watching a movie or TV show that has darks scenes I just put the tv brightness up.",
            "You're watching on an OLED, that can contribute heavily to the issue. For OLEDs, each individual pixel has it's own brightness, whereas on an LCD screen, brightness is for the whole screen, with \"black\" blocking the light. But there is still light leaking through in the blacks, and you can see better contrast at the cost of color accuracy. OLEDs look nicer but for dark scenes you can't see much contrast at all, so if a show isn't designed with that in mind, watching on an OLED screen can be frustrating.\n\nThe only thing you can do is turn the brightness all the way up, but depending on the scene that might not help at all.\n\nSource: Personal experience. I also watch TV on my Note 9.",
            "Some. I had to close my blinds and turn up my TV brightness to watch s8 of Game of Thrones, otherwise I couldn't see what was happening. Most other shows are fine on my normal settings mind.",
            "It's because you're not watching in the ideal way. Unfortunately while your phone may be convenient it is not designed to be optimized for theatrical presentation or audio. Best things you can do if you truly want to enjoy it is to optimize your the setting and watch mainly on your tv. especially those shows you feel are darker. Also, invest in an adequate sounds system and not rely on your tv/phone speakers. It may be inconvenient, but this content is produce to be enjoy in a theatre setting and not for you phone.",
            "Is it just me or is almost every Netflix Original been too dark in terms of lighting? ex:Daredevil,Punisher,Jessica Jones,etc.",
            "Yeah................But I like the darkness",
            "It's true, most new dramas and big TV shows go for a film look now, and that look happens to be either light or dark, no middle ground. I've noticed while watching Stranger Things that watching it in the day you get a lot of empty black space on your screen.",
            "I think the problem really is the quality of the streamed picture right? Sure it's a 1080p stream, but if the dithering is really bad, it makes the really dark scenes look like shit.",
            "I feel that way about old porn, like I can\u2019t see anything. Both because of the lighting and because of the...ummmm...grooming habits",
            "Yes! Thought it was just me.",
            "Shooting in very low light really took off in the last few years. For those of us who grew up with well-lit filming, it takes some effort to accept that it's a deliberate act. You just have to accept that it's intentional that you not see clearly.",
            "I think you just need to calibrate your tv dude. All these shows look fantastic on a proper screen.",
            "A lot of it is compression of streaming video. \n\nThese things are color graded and calibrated for their full bitrate viewing, closest you\u2019ll get is the 4k blu ray discs.\n\nHowever when you\u2019re steaming, even that \u201c4k\u201d signal on Netflix is HIGHLY compressed and data loss is most problematic in darker video scenes. Hence why it\u2019s usually not a problem when watching on a disc yet it\u2019s visually difficult when streamed.",
            "I was gonna agree until you said in terms of lighting lol",
            "* Too dark.\n* Dialogue is too quiet, sound effects are too loud.\n* Action scenes that cut and move so fast you have no clue what's happening.\n* Remake of the reboot of the remade reboot.\n* Shak-k-k-key cam.\n* Love story shoe-horned into every movie, ever.\n* Other stuff.",
            "No, I totally agree. They need to fix it!",
            "My main gripe is video games being so dark. But at least most of them allow you to adjust the lighting.",
            "You just gave me hope for my future. I have literally been thinking I must have something else wrong with me. Most shows are just something to listen to because the screen is black and blurry. I thought it was just me! \ud83d\ude02",

            "My mom was just complaining about it this watching The 100, she couldn't set the brightness  correctly on her tablet, but still isn't great when is set at 100%. I had the same problem with Stranger Things with my old Chromebook, the quality isn't good especially with darkness and it was awful to watch ...",
            "Same! I thought it was my eyes since I have glasses.",
            "If you watch stuff like this in properly lit room, without distractions, on reasonable and properly setup equipment, it\u2019s usually great. Same goes for a lot of complaints about sound issues (like dialogue too quiet).\n\nThe issue is that people don\u2019t want to do that. They want to watch stuff on a phone while doing the dishes, or watch an action movie while others are asleep and complain that it\u2019s too loud (try headphones). \n\nIs it the job of the producers to degrade their product to work better in the lowest quality use case? Arguably it is, but I don\u2019t blame them for going for a higher quality product.\n\nYou can also try to adjust the product yourself to fit your less ideal watching conditions - most TVs have automatic brightness adjusters and audio dynamic range compression, these will make the dark bits brighter and the quiet bits louder.",
            "This is why I love Better Call Saul so much, one of the very few shows I can actually see",
            "I always thought everything was dark so you couldn\u2019t see where they cut costs in production, or when the CG is a bit crummy",
            "I do!",
            "Yes, yes oh my god yes. \nI'm so happy it's not just me.",
            ">I was just watching stranger things\n\n1st mistake. Their actors are too repulsive to maintain an open eye towards. Be careful.",
            "Totally. I was watching the final season of Jessica Jones and SO many fight scenes were littered with these incredibly dark shots where the action, the subject of the shot, was impossible to make out. Absolutely frustrating",
            "Yeah. I watch a lot of horror shows and I have to squint and put on my glasses and turn off the lights and turn on the subtitles to keep up with these dark ass quiet mumbling ass shows",

            "As a lighting technician, I can see what you mean. it's probably the intentions to keep it dark, but it is sometimes hard to find the balance between enough light you can see and enough lack of light to still have an effect",
            "Yeah, I think it's to shame you into getting out and doing something. Sat there watching you're reflection in the TV slobbing out watching TV ain't great!",

            "I\u2019m not sure if this has been said yet but maybe try turning up the brightness on your tv\nSorry if this has already been said",
            "There's more to it than just brightness. \n\nFor your phone, being a samsung it probably has an OLED screen. Especially Samsung OLED screens have quite strong contrast and saturation out of the box. They can achieve good blacks because the pixels turn off, but the detail is lost there. There might be other display modes in the settings, to make it more accurate. Modes named like \"vivid\" are usually way too saturated.\n\nCan't say about the TV, but many modern TVs are OLED and have god awful contrast and color balance out of the box. In most TVs you can adjust, in addition to saturation and contrast, even gamma, backlight, shadows, blacks, highlights etc, which all have huge effects on the image. Just display a color, luminance balancing sheet on the TV and adjust the settings to show the full greyscale.\n\nFor film and tv, the colorist usually uses an IPS LCD display. These displays have a backlight, so it doesn't get as dark, but the detail in shadows is better and color is more accurate.",
            "Yes!! I wear my sunglasses",
            "I think it has to do with there being so many different types of televisions out there today, none are going to be optimal out of the box.   It's not like the old days where you could just take your tv out of the box, plug it in and your set.   I believe most shows are shot for optimal viewing on a regular 4K LCD television.  I say this because I have no problems with anything on my Samsung 4K LCD.  I've never had to mess with any settings, I just keep HDR turned on.  People bitched about the white walker battle on Game of Thrones this past season and I had no clue what they were going on about.   Yeah, it was a dark scene but I had no trouble seeing it just as it was supposed to be seen.\n\nMy advice for everyone would simply be to find the darkest show you can, one you're having trouble with, and use that show to calibrate your television screen.  Change your settings so that show is easily viewed.  If that show is clear, everything else should be too.",
