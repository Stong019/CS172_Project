            "I think that this is more common in places where they don't get much snow or rain, like California.  In Canada we always take off our shoes so as not to track dirt and mud around the house.  It's not a hard cultural rule like it is in Japan, but more of a practical necessity.  It's also common to have a different pair of shoes in the office, than the boots that you are wearing walking around outside.",
            "Not all Americans do this. I think it depends on the region. I'm American and I don't wear shoes in the house, and neither do the people I know. But it's not so much a strict rule like it is in Japan - if I was just quickly running inside to get something, I probably wouldn't remove my shoes.",
            "For my job, I visit 10-15 houses, 6 days a week. I carry a reusable pair of slip on booties because we aren't allowed to take our shoes off (they're safety equipment). When I get to a house I look for clues (glances at my shoes, a pile of shoes by the door) and just slip them on if I think they want me to. When is messy outside, I'll put them on at every house.

My boyfriend and I both have a few pairs of house shoes, and have special shoes to go deal with the animal messes in the backyard and basement.\n\n\nPlus living in the northern part of the United States we get a lot of snow and slush this time of year and no matter how many times I swifter there is too much dirt to just wear socks. \n\n\nAlso living in a college dorm a long time ago and using those showers have conditioned me to never be barefoot, I even wear flip flops in the shower.",

I found it very uncomfortable that in accommodation I was expected to wear slippers that were communal. The idea of putting on shoes that other people had worn really freaked me out. I also don\u2019t like the idea of going barefoot in other people\u2019s houses because my feet are the only feet that have touched the inside of my shoe, whereas other people\u2019s bare feet have touched their floors. Either way is gross in its own right. We just need to accept that everyone is different ",

            "We don\u2019t sleep near the floor or sit on it ever, so the floor for us isn\u2019t as much a part of our usable space. We do most of our living above the floor. We feel the same way you do when it comes to shoes on our couches or in our beds; that disgusts us probably to the level the floor does for you.",
            "A lot of people have mats to wipe your shoes off on before coming in. That gets most of the dirt that would make a big mess. I hear people mention the \"what if you step in poop\" thing, but if that happens you usually notice from the smell while you're still outside. If you accidentally make a noticeable mess, you clean it up. I wear my shoes inside sometimes, but I also vacuum weekly and mop often enough that it's not like I'm wallowing in filth. And if I have to run in and out multiple times (like when bringing in groceries) I'm not gonna be taking my shoes off and on every time I hit the doorway.\n\nThat said, I know multiple Americans who do want everyone to take their shoes off. Unless you're an ass, you'll comply but will probably think, \"Oh, they're really particular about cleanliness.\"",
            "I live in England and nobody I know insists that you take your shoes off when you come in. If I'm staying in for the rest of the day I will take them off, but if I'm doing things I'll keep them on. Unless you're covered in mud I don't really see the problem.

People don't purposely track dirt into someone's home. \n\nAs another noted, we eat off higher tables than some and our beds and furniture are also high off the floor. \n\nWe also have large dogs that bring ground matter into the home. I would not trade the love of our family pets for a bit of dirt because we zsweep and vacuum regularly. \n\nI do think it's a good idea to remove shoes, and to each their own if that's important to you. We do if it's muddy or obviously dirtier than usual, but just general ground matter can be mostly \"stomped off\" at the door mat.\n\nThis discussion is no different than asking why all Americans don't use bidets, why do we \"smear the feces in...instead of washing it with a bidet.\" ",

It would seem to me that [insert reasons why it seems like a bad idea to wear shoes in the house].\"\n\nThis would let you express your feelings on the matter without directly denigrating anybody else.",

            "I'm American, from Georgia.\n\nThis is a fascinating conversation! Ok, in warmer weather I wear sandals most of the time and my shoes come off almost immediately when I come inside.\n\nIn colder weather though, I leave my shoes ON inside until I'm ready to sit down and relax. I have hardwood floors so they can be chilly, but honestly, until I'm ready to stop running around, I don't even think about removing my shoes.\n\nIf I'm home all day, I wouldn't bother putting shoes on at all though, just going barefoot or wearing socks.\n\nIf I go to someone else's home, I would not take my shoes OFF unless they mentioned it because that seems a little too informal and disrespectful. Maybe it's silly but I feel like showing my socks to people I hardly know is a bit too casual?\n\nI should add, I work in a professional environment. If I wear shoes somewhere that gets them dirty like hiking, strawberry picking etc, the shoes would come off as soon as I walked in the door so as not to spread dirt all over the house. I think that is common of most people who have shoes used in a more utilitarian way.\n\nI've never heard of a single person who wears shoes in bed and it's generally considered seriously rude to put shoed feet on couches or beds.",

Trade schools are a wonderful thing - there are people who work long, arduous hours, come home smelling terrible, and are extremely happy.\n\nWith that said, going to college had a specific purpose years ago, which was in simple terms to become formally educated in order to be \u2018qualified\u2019 to be in a certain position (such as a teaching degree or an engineering degree). When the government took over student loans back in the 70s-80s, that was when college became less of a place for formal education and more of a business. Moreover, going to college does NOT in any capacity guarantee a \u201cbetter\u201d paying job. It may give you a few more opportunities, but if you get a degree that is only useful in a very niche area, you should expect to have a limited number of options.

(who cares about them)\n\nSOME people, want \"more\" than the basic essentials, want a fancy car, or something, since people don't NEED to work blue collar jobs, they will receive higher pay.\n\nSome people (and this I think is the most exciting), will be aspiring people who will be free to pursue their interests which could lead to an explosion of invention/discovery.

More to the point we need to stop the notion that jobs like CPA or CEO mean making 5-10x what literally everyone else makes.\n\nMost importantly we need to get past the notion that \"traditional\" college is the only or best way.

            "Yes, we would still have poor people. This is because the system is broken and only favors a few. We are selfish creatures and our society/system reflects that. We need a new system, built by rare humans who are not selfish. \n\nSince I was a kid, I've wondered why we have to pay for things like food or water, which are essential to our survival. I live in Canada thankfully, so at least our healthcare is free. No one bats an eye about why healthcare is free (\"Of course it should be free!\"), but when I ask why other essential things for survival aren't free (very *basic* food, water, shelter and clothing) people say \"Well because those things cost money, we can't enslave people, and people would become lazy if all that stuff was free!\" Um... what? No. Healthcare costs billions of dollars, but we find a way to pay every doctor and nurse. I've always held the opinion that basic things for our survival should be free and easily accessible for all. Things like basic food, water, clothing and shelter to survive. And when I say basic I mean the basics to keep us relatively healthy, nothing fancy. Like \"basic food\" wouldn't include cakes or cookies, but things like potatoes, proteins, vegetables, fruits, etc. Stuff you need to live. Those things should be free. \n\nBut who will pay the workers you ask? Everyone will. We include all those \"free\" things into taxes, therefore *everyone* puts a little into the moneypot so that *everyone* gets what they need. This system actually exists right now, this isn't a new idea. Denmark and Finland have adopted this idea. They have free healthcare and free education (it is illegal for a school to charge tuition in Finland), and the government pays those who have lost (or even voluntarily *LEFT)* their jobs enough money per month to cover the basics for living. I watched a video about a Finnish young adult who didn't like her job, it wasn't bringing her happiness. So she quit and the government paid her $2000/month to take it easy and figure out what she wants to do first and I think she decided to become an artist (because \"starving artists\" isn't a thing there). This is common practice there. Citizens pay higher taxes, but because of that everyone takes care of each other. They don't mind paying more because they see it as an *investment* into an amazing future and way of life. Homelessness doesn't exist there either. On top of that, every profession is respected. People treat you the same if you're a doctor vs a garbage man, because they realize that every job is valuable and important. Large wage gaps don't exist. A doctor makes more than a garbage man, but not by a ridiculous amount. And the thing is, in places like Denmark and Finland, you don't even *need* a job that pays a lot. There's no need to make a lot of money, because everything you need to live a good life is already provided for you. Your job is just added income and something for you to enjoy doing.\n\nIn future societies, I believe this way of life will eventually be common practice. And they will look back at *our* time the same way *we* look back at the way of life back in the 1800s or 1900s, and feel bad about how difficult our lives must have been (and then be grateful they don't live in *our* time, where we had to actually *PAY* for things we needed to survive!!

            "All the time, I never see my pics and think,  \"hey I look good in this one.\" So I assume other people see me the same way and I don't care to have other people see my flawed face",
            "[deleted]",
            "I used to feel that way but then I saw people doing \"duck lips\" and I tried and each time I ended up laughing  , that ended up turning out to produce pictures of me happy and smiling and I started to enjoy seeing those moments.",
            "I typically hate selfies but started taking them here and there since the stay at home thing started. I take them when I actually look like crap, I take them when I think I look like crap and I take them when I think I'm having a good day. \n\nI erase 99% of them almost immediately. Some that I've kept are Myspace angled with makeup and smooth hair, some are in harsh light, some are after sweaty yard work.\n\nI still don't love pictures of myself but it's already been cool to see the changes in my hair - so much more gray- the stress in my face fluctuating, etc. Most of what's happened this year does not feel real but I will have these pictures to remind me I was in it and it changed me faster than anything in my history ever has.",
            "Yes literally I cannot do it it makes me feel sick. And when I need a photo of myself there are none!",
            "Snapping friend\n\n*friend sends selfie*\n\nMe:\n*snaps picture of shoes for the 741st time I\u2019m a row*",
            "Yep, I once took a selfie in a festival, what a cringey moment it was.",
            "I am generally opposed to taking selfies for similar reasons. I feel super awkward and self-absorbed. \n\nBut one time I was having a bad day and my boyfriend sent me on an adventure. He told me to take the train to the beach and stop everywhere I wanted and do what I wanted. The only catch was I had to take selfies at every place and send them to him. I now have an amazing collection of photos from a whole day. I can see my mood lifting as the day progresses and I get to remember almost everything about it.\n\nI still only take photos without myself in them, but if you give yourself a goal or a purpose with it, like documenting your day, it doesn't feel as weird.",
            "I think is related to insecurity. This happen to me too, I'm unable to take a selfie around people, I can do it when I'm all alone, but I always end up covering a part of my face.",
            "Honestly every time I try and take a selfie it reminds me of all of the \"snapchat girls\" from my days in school. (The ones with the duck lips or the stupid tongue sticking out) and it makes me cringe so hard I just stop immediately.",
            "People love to hate on others taking selfies, especially if they\u2019re having fun. \n\nI used to be ashamed of taking selfies, even in my own home, but I asked myself: why am I so ashamed? There\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with taking a photo of your face to share. Sure, there\u2019s times and places for everything (please don\u2019t stop in the middle of a huge group on the sidewalk and take a selfie when it\u2019s super inconvenient to other people).\n\nThe girls doing the duck lips or silly faces? Nothing wrong with them. Let them do their own thing, it doesn\u2019t impact you.\n\nEdit: okay I hate to be that person but thank you so much kind anonymous redditor! you\u2019ve gifted me my first ever gold! please continue to spread the love! \ud83d\udc96 it touches my heart dearly that you\u2019ve considered this comment enough to be gold worthy!",
            "Saaaame. I realised if you looked at my Instagram account, you'd only know it was me because my dog makes random appearances. I just don't like taking \"selfies\" and when I'm out with friends I'm enjoying the experience and don't want to pester them to take photos",
            "Yes. Or asking my husband or mom to take a picture of me in a cute out? Pffffft. Nope. I try to do cute poses? Que just being so dang embarrassed!!",
            "Think about this. A lot of us live away from our families, and selfies is a way to keep far away family members up to date, ya know?\n\nAlso, memories. One day, we won't be around anymore. If you never have pictures of yourself, what are your children or remaining family members going to hang on their wall for rememberance? \n\nNot ever taking any pictures at all is, in and of itself, a somewhat selfish act. My wife never let's me take her picture, and it drives me crazy.\n\nNot all selfies are cringe, nor is the mere act of taking one. If your taking pictures of yourself 10 times a day, yeah, you're overdoing it. But here and there? Nah. There's good reason to take selfies.\n\nLet's not forget the historical selfies, which required people to stand still for hours while they were painted. What sounds more cringe and narcissistic? A quick snap of a picture, or investing hours in a portrait you will hang up in the public lobby of a huge mansion for servants to goggle as they slave away for you?",
            "honestly i think y\u2019all care way too much about what other people think! who cares if they see you taking a selfie! you\u2019ll most likely never see them again in your life! not to mention, in this day and age taking a selfie is so normal. i highly doubt anyone would think anything of it, especially at an event or whatnot.",
            "I've often wondered how other people manage to look natural in their selfies, or in any pictures? I cramp up in some sort of insane facial rictus in the presence of cameras. I speculate that it has something to do with face awareness. \n\nIt doesn't matter what kind of face I try to make for the camera, it always looks unnatural and forced, other people can pull off perfect imitations of expressions to suit the picture, I always look the same. :(",
            "I've never been in a place that interested me so much I wanted a picture of it, where I thought \"Hey, nobody will believe I'm here so I better insert my face into this picture.\"",
            "I wish I didn't feel that way about pictures in general. I have hardly any photos of my family because they all feel that way.",
            "I am working towards one of those \u201cSelfie Everyday\u201d videos and have been taking one a day since Christmas 2017. Still feel weird doing it and only do it alone or with good friends who know about it in the background.",
            "So here is what I do: I take selfies, and in my head they are ironic and I can post them with self-aware captions. Secretly I just like the way I look and want people to see for self esteem reasons",
            ">What kind of mindset are people putting themselves in when they take selfies?\n\nIf you cringe during a selfie, it's because you feel insecure. The key to feeling okay taking a selfie is to give zero fucks about what other people think. If you like your #ootd, take that selfie and give zero fucks. Post that shit and let the likes roll in.",
            "And then when you get on a daring app with like 2 selfies you happen to take at some point in your life you barely match with anyone because who matches with weirdos that have 2 okay pics and the rest are just memes.... *sigh*",
            "Oh yeah, hate it. \n\nBut keep taking them.  You'll get better, and you'll learn to like your face more.",
            "I don\u2019t take selfies of just me. With my wife on vacation or a friend I haven\u2019t seen in a while, sure thing. Just me? Hell no. Only exception is sometimes my wife asks for a picture immediately after I get a haircut. And sometimes I find a funny hat.",
            "Same. I almost never take selfies and whenever i see someone taking one in a public place i immediately feel embarrassed for them and turn away as fast as i can as if they were naked?",
            "I think I just look like shit Niall of them so why bother",
            "Im really insecure about the way I look. So I deny if that circumstance ever comes",
            "same. I dont mind selfies so much if Im out doing something I want to remember but 95% of the time it just makes me feel super awkward. Smiling or even looking interested at an inanimate object feels off to me. It makes online dating a bit much since people always start asking for more photos than what you have already posted. \nI think part of it is because I feel like the whole act is kind of self absorbed. Have you ever watched someone take and retake selfies? Theres some serious second hand cringe there.",
            "Yep. Or I look in the mirror and I'm like \"oo I look good today\" .. I turn on my camera and I look like a baboon.. what the.. \ud83d\ude02",
            "No because I\u2019m not a people pleaser, who cares what other people think. I take them because I want to and that\u2019s how you should live. If someone thinks it\u2019s cringey? Fuck em. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udd95",
            "Absolutely not. I feel great taking selfies. There are actually some people that like how you look and want to see you.",
            "\"Am I obsessed with myself? God this makes me a narcissist.\" *turns camera around*",
            "A lot of people in here are saying they are embarrassed every time they do it. I felt the same when selfie was more of a buzz word, but there is no reason to feel bad for taking a picture. As long as you arnt being obnoxious or doing it at an inappropriate time - there is no need for feeling bad about taking a photo of yourself. You and the people around you might want some in the future.",
            "I\u2019m 44 and have had a camera of some sort since I was 5 or 6.  I have probably taken 30 total, mostly in the last 12 years, and almost entirely with someone else.  \n\nI have a really nice one with my wife from 6 years ago that cropped well for the company directory, and one two winters ago with the family, and on winter ago with a bunch of friends for new year\u2019s.\n\nHalf of the ones that are just me are a reply to someone else, and I\u2019ll make a really messed up face.",
            "I have 1 or 2 to ask an opinion of a jacket I bought or something. That's it, hate em. I cringe super hard when I see folk take them too, dunno why",
            "That\u2019s the way vanity is supposed to feel.",
            "Looking at myself in the mirror is bad enough",
            "i generally believe the best pictures taken from someone is when they don\u2018t even know they\u2018re being photographed, since they can\u2018t \u201efake\u201c something. \n\nwhen taking a selfie you always try to strike a pose or get something in frame or whatever. to me they don\u2018t feel genuine and do not portray the people in them properly.",
            "My parents(mid 60s) take selfies with no problem. Even in big family gatherings. I was once asked to take a selfie during a family event and I said \" I don't know how to take selfie\". I am in my 20s btw",
            "My motivator is \"well I've put all this makeup on, wouldn't want pure powdered money to go to waste\"",
            "My daughter takes selfies a lot, when she lived at home she took selfies with the dog, all the time, even now when anyone picks up a phone to look at it, the dog jumps up beside them for a picture :)",
            "I hate it. I am that one girl friend who cringes when going out when all my friends start taking group selfie after selfie. And I hate filters.  I think its because when I see them online it feels so self-interested. They constantly check their social media for likes after posting. I guess I feel like I don\u2019t need that sort of outside validation to feel good about myself? Idk. (I am married and they are all single...does that have something to do with it??) \n\nBut yes. Cringy.",
            "I wasn\u2019t totally into selfies before, but I recently met a bunch of my friends after like 6 years, and they had all looked so different, I had to \u201crecord\u201d it. So I started taking selfies with everyone. The more I did it, the more it got normalized in my head to the point where\u2019s it no big deal any more. The \u201cmindset\u201d I\u2019m in when taking a selfie is \u201clet\u2019s take a picture with this very close friend of mine so I can remember what he looks like later\u201d.  \n  \nI\u2019m still not totally into solo selfies though, those I find kinda pointless, unless it\u2019s to specifically highlight that I was present somewhere.",
            "I only take selfies at the end (or turn-around point) of long, grueling hikes. 10 miles in, 2500' elevation change, and a pretty mountain in the background. \nI put on a big, happy smile for the camera so I can have a pretty picture to remind my future self what I have done. Then I look at the picture I just took and I look like I got hit by a bus, dumped into a ravine, and gnawed on by giant mosquitoes. Still keep the picture, just never show anyone.",
            "Yes. I used to feel insecure about it all the time. Then my husband started working for the army and he is gone away a lot.  To keep our relationship healthy I started to take selfies all the time and send them to him. Selfies with my dogs walking, selfies at lunch, selfies while cooking, selfies while watching tv, selfies while hanging out with friends, even ..... work out selfies :-O.  \nI find if your with people you know if you just yell out \"selfie!\" everyone jumps in the photo with you as well and it makes it more fun. \n\nLike with anything the more you do it the less cringey and insecure you will feel.",
            "I feel cringey if I get caught taking a selfie in front of other people/strangers",
            "I hate taking selfies and having my photo taken. It's a battle of never knowing what to do with my smile/face/hands/whatever.",
            "I don't like it either. What makes is worse is the auto flip thing. So even when I take a bit to line it up so I don't look awkward, the picture flips and it ends up looking awkward anyway.",
            "I look sheepish and awkward in my once every year selfie. Once I tried in public because the place was so beautiful, but whenever someone walked by I would put the camera down lol.\nI think people who take a lot of selfies AND POST THEM, simply can't get enough of themselves and/ or are sociable people who thrive in other's validation. Women especially, seem to feel obligated to comment on each other's selfies in an exaggerated, insincere manner like \"queen\", \"gorgeous\" etc. It makes me think they would like that type of comment, but I, a woman, not only find my own selfies cringe, but most of my friends' too. \nTo put yourself in the mood to take selfies, choose a day you feel well, and be on your own. There are some listicles and you tube videos on how to pose to minimize cringiness and unfortunate features. I want to get over it, but I don't think I will. You're definitely not alone.",
            "Honestly the way I get around that is getting to take the photos with other people. Everyone likes to be photographed but yeah it feels cringe and vain to take a photo of yourself. If you\u2019re looking for any advise as to how to get over this, I try to take a photo of myself whenever I feel really happy and try to immortalize that feeling. I suffer from depression, but having those small glimmers to remind yourself of the moment is so nice and the more you do it, the less cringe it is and the more self confidence you build up \u2764\ufe0f",
            "Not cringy. I just always felt like it became a thing to do because everyone else was seemingly doing it, even though it's not really that deep or meaningful. I never took a selfie of myself until I went to Helsinki, Finland in January of this year, and even when I did for the first time, I thought to myself that it wasn't for someone else's entertainment, but more to reflect on my own enjoyment of the moment and the emotions I expressed in my eyes and face. Does that make sense? Why take a selfie for someone else whom you assume actually cares about your photo? There's no real point to it.",
            "The more you do it the more relaxed you feel doing it. There are groups all over sm to practice sharing your uncomfortable selfies until you get more relaxed about it. If it's something you actually want to do. Otherwise silly selfies are great.",
            "Yes!!! This is 100% me. I didn\u2019t know other people felt the same way. I think it\u2019s related to insecurity; I'm unable to take a selfie around people and I can barely even do it when I'm all alone. Whenever I need a photo of myself there are none! It\u2019s really frustrating!",
            "I have never taken a selfie in my life. Closest I\u2019ve come is photos of a tattoo I have, and a partial reflection in something I was cooking. I\u2019d feel awkward as shit to see my fat features on record. Had a photographer at my wedding and had about 10 pics taken posed. The rest had to be candid or I\u2019d get a hardcore flop sweat.",
            "Yes. It's the reason I never made an online dating profile",
            "Ugh me too. I can\u2019t even take selfies that included others. Therefore....only one photo of me and my boyfriend of three years.\n\nThe cringe outweighs the desire for memories.",
            "I used to and I still do, but after breaking up with my long term best friend/girlfriend I realized that I had no pictures of myself to put up for online dating and that one day, my kids, me and whoever would have no reference of me from that period. That\u2019s when I decided to start taking pictures more often.",
            "I do too. I think part of it is that someone decided to call it a \"selfie\" which is the cringiest part to me.",
            "I think it\u2019s a healthy instinct to feel funny indulging in narcissism to the degree that we all do these days.",
            "I don\u2019t take pictures of myself because I hate how I look. I also don\u2019t have social media except this so there is no reason to take any I guess. I force myself and pretend there is nothing wrong if my girlfriend asks for a photo.",
            "I hate seeing my reflection, hence I dont take selfies",
            "Eh, I'm just ugly.",
            "I have 0 selfies in my phone.\n\nOn the other hand, I take plenty of selfies in other people's phones when I manage to snatch them for a while. I like the thought of them browsing through their gallery none the wiser, when suddenly they encounter a plethora of images of my ugly mug.",
            "The ones who post them on social media are narcissisty",
            "I went to the coffee shop yesterday I live in the Netherlands so they don't sell coffee there. This Asian guy with a mask stood there taking mad selfies alone with random people then left.",
            "I hate taking selfies. The only time I do is for special occasions or if I\u2019m on a vacation because I want to share the memory. \n\nI used to be mesmerized looking through my parents old polaroids, or seeing them on display in the house. But I just can\u2019t imagine being proud of my kids looking through a photo album of me making the same faces over and over again.",
            "I have zero picture of myself on my phone.",
            "love yourself and others around you, taking pictures does everyone a favor of memory.",
            "I feel like it began for me around the time that the whole culture that spawned the word \"selfie\" really came into existence. Before that it was just taking a picture of yourself, after that it's got all sorts of weird connotations of vanity and self-aggrandizement that didn't really come into play before.",
            "YES. \n\nMy Instagram and social media have very few selfies and they\u2019re only on there because I felt they were \u201cartistic\u201d (I don\u2019t mean facetune).",
            "I just think vanity is stupid. Like yeah take care of yourself and be proud of the way you look, but selfies starts to cross the line into self obsession. You find people\u2019s insta pages and its 2,000 fucking selfies, stop analyzing yourself and putting a weird bastardized version of your life on display, just live your life.",
            "I have never understood selfies - especially multiples that are then shared on social media.  \u201cLook at me! Look at me!\u201d  WTF.",
            "I worked for a company that required taking 2 selfies a day with a clocking-in/out app. I didn\u2019t stay much longer after that was implemented.",
            "I just feel like who gives a crap",
            "I have 146 selfies on my phones camera roll rn, but i only just got this phone, im sure the all time count is much higher. I just genuinely like how i look, and nobody else has any pictures of me since i dont have friends so i might as well be the one to do it. I only post some to my onlyfans and the rest are just for me because i like to look back",
            "Yes, i cringe watching my photos too. I used to cringe looking at the mirror not because of me being ugly, id consider myself kinda average but i just don\u2019t like taking pictures.",

            "I also don't take selfies. Partly because I find it cringey and partly because I look like shit in them. Usually the pictures of me I like are the ones others take without me knowing it. Unfortunately that doesn't happen too often so I rarely have current photos.",
            "I used to feel that was. Actually, I still do but I force myself to take selfies. Because one day I looked back at my high school pictures, there were hardly any. I have a lot of memes saved from those days but barely any of me, my friends, when we hung out. \n\nSo if you want pictures in 10-20 years of you to see what you looked like, your style, what you did, you'll have to take selfies. That also include when you're with friends, someone needs to pull out their phone and take a quick selfie of everyone.",

            "I refuse to take selfies at all. They always highlight my natural curves in such away that I look 50lbs heavier than I am. For some reason it's like the picture of me is like taking a full screen image and making it widescreen without any editing. And no I'm not super skinny but I do only carry extra weight in my belly and therefore slightly in my waist. After never weighing over 130lbs until I hit my 20s its absolutely devastating to feel like I'm becoming such an unhealthy weight for me. Solution: dont take selfies because they lower my self esteem.",
            "I used to be the same, until I started making vlogs on my old PSP to describe my days in a new country, found those relics and thought to myself that selfies and videos were something that I could use to compare myself overtime. I decided to take more and more selfies and videos and just upload them on ain't and TikTok, I mean no one really sees them, it's just more of my lil own time capsule, but that's how I got over the cringe. And there was this youtube phase in my school way back when everyone wanted to be YouTubers so got on the back of that and posted videos to be on the trend:P they all suck but helped me greatly get through the cringe I used to have of hearing myself and seeing me",

            "That's right. For me it's I'm afraid of looking bad even though I'm the only one who will ever see it. Luckily, if I'm in a group, I just go along with it by not looking at the picture.\n\nConsequently, I make a big deal about how to make a good Instagram picture, and I plan days ahead to get like half an hour to only take the repeated picture I want. It's a pain I feel obligated to",
            "I remember when I was in 6th grade I took so many selfies and posted them all on Instagram, it wasn\u2019t till recently I remembered the existence of that Instagram account which I forgot about it for a few years, I immediately logged into that account and deleted everything. Wtf is wrong with 11 year old me.",
            "That's the same for me, but I think people who often take selfies just have more social confidence, I consider myself farely confident, but not enough to publicly tale selfies",
            "When i was a teenager i always thought selfies were stupid and narcissistic, and i always felt cringey trying to take a picture of myself. Now I\u2019m in my 20s and i wish i had more pictures of me and my friends from highschool, so it made me want to take pictures more. I also got better looking so im less self conscious now.\n\nPlus, it\u2019s fun to think that one day historians are gonna be looking through all our pictures. All the dickwads that i used to quietly judge all day in highschool have thousands of pictures of themselves, so now it\u2019s my duty to take better pictures than them and leave a cooler mark on the world",

            "Yup, the only time I've ever taken a selfie is when I got hit in the face with a puck playing hockey. It was pretty gnarly. Otherwise, I don't think my face is interesting enough to be worth taking pictures of.",
            "when i take selfies alone i do it because i think i look good, that\u2019s my mindset. i can\u2019t take selfies with other people around, though. i feel like they\u2019re judging me and i get too embarrassed. if there are other people around i\u2019ll ask them to take a photo for me instead.\n\ni\u2019ve never felt cringey taking a selfie by myself unless i\u2019m doing a \u2018cringey\u2019 pose like sticking my tongue out or duck face, but those are just for fun. if i\u2019m just smiling like it\u2019s a regular photo i don\u2019t see why it would be cringe, it\u2019s just a headshot of me, taken by me. sometimes they look nice, and you have much more control of how you and the photo looks than if someone else was taking your photo for you.",
            "I become extremely self conscious when taking selfies. Have less than 5 in total.",
            "My phone doesn't contain any photos of me. I don't get people who do. It does make it hard for when you want the photo for your dating profile because you realise you don't actually have any.\n\nAll the photos of me are on Facebook from my uni days, and I look blackout drunk in all of them. Or I'm dressed as a zombie or something, can use any of them.",

            "It makes Tinder impossible lol",
            "When I was a teenager it was seen as narcissistic and sad to take pictures of just yourself. I never saw a huge problem with doing it for special occasions like if you want to show yourself at a landmark or if you\u2019ve accomplished something that you want to show off.",
            "I used to never take selfies for that exact reason until I met my vain af girlfriend who will literally pull me to any reflective surface to take a ton of pictures.\nIn the beginning I found it quite cringe but honestly,nobody gives a fuck.\nWe\u2019ll be sitting in front of a mirror for 20 minutes taking the weirdest pictures and people just go about their day.\nIt\u2019s not cringe if you don\u2019t make it cringy.\nIf you\u2019re confident in your actions people don\u2019t care.\nJust pull out your phone,snap a quick picture and mind your own business and people will do the same",
            "Yeah I hate them.  It wasn't an issue until my almost 4 year old daughter wanted to start taking pictures all the time.  I usually lean out of the frame.  I just hate selfies so much",
            "I've been told my whole life that I'm a good looking man and no...not by my mom lol. And even though attractive women are attracted to me, I completely hate to look at myself. Forget selfies, I'm simply unable to take one, can't stand them and perhaps it's because I can't stand myself. I hate how I look, I hate how I feel, I hate what I've become. I simply hate everything about myself and the fact that I cannot accept who I am. Talk about positivity. This little rant helps me in finally admitting this to myself",

            "I've never taken a selfie of just myself because I find it to be insufferable when shared broadly. I have taken them with my wife and friends, though, and do not have the same feeling about that.",
            "I do usually take selfies when on snapchat to send to people but not just to save. I do have a couple here and there but I do cringe when I see them. Not becausr I dont like the way I look but just seeing myself is weird.",
            "Yes. I hate selfies and I never take them. The only time I do is when I\u2019m somewhere worthwhile (Yellowstone, Grand Teton, stuff like that) because if looking through old family albums means anything, no one wants to look at the pictures with no people in it.",

            "I rarely take pictures without a purpose. Pictures of the cat probably being the only exception. If I need help identifying and item, or to comunicate something to someone, or to help me remember details for work like sn or configuration of plumbing or electrical. If I'm at the zoo or hiking and see something cool I'll record it. Sometimes I'll send close friends pictures of me that are selfies as jokes or for specific reasons. I don't post a lot of personal stuff to social media.",
            "The only time I take them is when I go on holiday alone...just so I can prove I was there.\n\nStill hate taking them though.\n\nI always think the person holding the camera on group selfies looks like a tosser.",
            "Id much rather have someone take a picture of me, or at least prop it somewhere and use the timer.",
            "It's just one of those things you gotta get over. Do it a few times until you realize literally nobody gives a shit about you.\n\nWhat do you think when you see a girl taking a selfie in Starbucks? Literally nothing, maybe a small passing thought about how silly she looks and then you go about your day. That will be the extent of everyone else's thoughts too.\n\nIt's like doing ANYTHING in public: Wearing that silly outfit, singing on the sidewalk, practicing a dance move here and there. It might be a fleeting thought on someone's mind but they don't give a FUCK about you, man. Don't feel bad, you're the only person judging you.",
            "Every time I do try to take a selfie that's not a \"joke\" one, I feel fake and awful. \"Look at you, trying desperately to look sexy. It's embarrassing, stop trying. Oh my god, this is so cringy. You don't look like this. Stop trying so hard, this is a little pathetic. Jesus, you actually think this looks good? So much for casual. You're not even decent enough to be so vain, this is hard to watch. You think someone like you can do this? And here I thought you were above such things. It's like a toddler trying on lipstick, except you're just creeping me out as much as you make me laugh. Just put your phone down and try to forget it.\"\n\nBecause of that, I try really hard to go through with it when I want to take a selfie. My self esteem needs to be better, and I need to push through the barrier of bitter and jealous judgement that puts everything down in an attempt to pull itself up. It's not cringy, and if I follow through with logically knowing that, maybe one day I'll feel confident enough to feel it.\n\nThat's also why I stopped taking joke photos of myself with double chins and stuff. It's easy to do a \"haha I'm not serious I'm way above all this\", but it's a poor substitute for actual confidence and hiding under a mask of \"couldn't care less\" \"irony\" doesn't help when it's built on a lie. Even if my photos don't look good, they're a genuine attempt to, they're making myself vulnerable to legitimate criticism from myself and others and showing me trying, and that's worthy of praise, not scorn.\n\nYou're not alone.",

It always helps trick my mind because its less \"hey i'm taking a selfie\" and more \"hey i'm taking a picture of this cool thing with me in it\".  Also helps with the \"not photogenic\" feeling i'm seeing a lot of in the comments (which I also suffer from a lot) since the focus of the picture isn't just on you.",

When I finally got a phone I was in 8th grade, and the camera quality wasn\u2019t high enough for me to really even take pictures.  I only got a good quality phone last year.  I now feel no need to take selfies.  The only reason that I can think up to take some is so that future me can look back on what I looked like.",

            "Gullible comment section. No 'old teacher' would post a question like this straight to Reddit instead of actually... googling it or asking someone.\n\nUnless.. OP is embellishing to whore karma. Shock. Their writing style even reads like a teenager.",
            "**Hoax alert! Please, hear me out before downvoting me, and if you still do, please at least offer a rebuttal**\n\nI don't doubt that you're a teacher, or your students said this to you, there's no reason to.\n\nBut there is almost no chance that this post is not \"karma whoring\".\n\nFirstly, your account is **five days old...** **Jackpot!**\n\nOf course it could be a throw away account, but if it were, you'd probably mention it. But also, you've made several posts completely unrelated to this topic before this one, so you didn't create it just to ask this question. It would be less suspicious if this were your first post, instead of the 7th or 8th.\n\nYour post is **precisely** the perfect blend of sweet naivet\u00e9 mixed with being oblivious that you're a wonderful person that presses all of reddit's feely buttons. Just look at those awards! It's almost like it was intended to do exactly that...\n\nAlso, excellent reddit etiquette with the edits, **it's almost like you've been here much longer.**\n\nYou say they call you **\"a goat\"** in the title and then switch to **\"the goat\"** in the text, which are obviously not the same thing. Indefinite vs definite articles are not something people generally confuse. Being called a goat could have  multiple meanings, being called \"the goat\" has one, and is easily found with a quick search.\n\nThey've said it all year and you're just wondering now what it means? Also, all year, none of the 20-30 13 year olds slipped up and said what it meant? Was this orchestrated? Why didn't they tell you, anyway? Surely they'd want you to know.\n\n**Why didn't you ask anyone around you in the real world before asking reddit? Why didn't you google it?** Googling (or duckduckgo, etc) \"the goat meaning\" brings up \"greatest of all time\" as a search suggestion before you even hit enter. Urban dictionary exists, and this definition is in there.\n\n**Another of your (very few) posts even details advanced knowledge of search engine usage.**\n\n>\"I couldn't find any matches when reverse searching for mine either.  \n>  \n>There are advanced reverse image searching services out there (that you pay for) but I don't know if I want to use them.\"\n\nI highly doubt that your first instinct to find out what being called \"the goat\" means was to post on reddit. a site you've only been using for five days, when you knew a search engine would have answered your question (before you even hit enter), just without all of the attention, praise, awards and dopamine.\n\n**What if it meant something negative/mean/offensive (etc)? You really not going to check that before telling others that  a large number of people you work with has been calling you it for a year..? It might have meant deathly halitosis, or bad combover. Risky!**\n\nCome on Reddit. We've been here before!\n\nAgain, I am not saying OP is definitely not a teacher, or that their students definitely didn't call them \"the goat\", or that they didn't know what it meant at  the time and so had to look it up. These are all perfectly plausible.\n\n**What I am saying they almost certainly knew what it meant when they posted it to reddit, for the karma, awards and attention.**\n\nBefore anyone calls me envious, I'm writing this because I don't like stolen valour (or usurped awards) or \"karma whoring\", and I don't like emotional manipulation for personal gains.\n\nYou may now downvote me to oblivion, though I ask that if you  do, please also take a moment to debunk my points.\n\nI believe  in you, reddit!\n\nEdit: Five days old not two.\n\nEdit 2: Sorry I'm writing like a child, I'm at day 4 ish of a Covid infection and typing with a TV remote keyboard, looking through one eye due to the headache. Also... Positive karma!  Reddit, so pleased to know you can be reasoned with.\n\nEdit 3: **First, thanks for the gold! You truly are the goat.** I'm glad my nerdy ramblings are appreciated. This has got out of hand, have you seen twitter? I would not like to be in OP's position.. twitter is fickle.\n\nSecondly: **Come on, down voters, I challenged, even begged you to debunk my points, not just click and move on! This post has reached 25 about 5 times now, the positive score won't hide you! Won't even one of you speak?**",

            "This whole thread is making me super confused.\n\nFirstly, about internal monologues, do people actually spell out sentences like \"no, I shouldn't do that\", for example, in their head? I do have sort of a voice in my head while typing or reading, but the only thing it does is narrate the words. I don't form my thoughts into actual sentences, because that just seems like a waste of time. The voice only happens as a translation from my abstract thoughts to language (or the other way around) when I need to. (This is also how I classify \"knowing\" a language. If I am unable to form the sentences directly into the language, and it is interrupted by a better known language, I am not yet sufficient in it.) However, I do sometimes get music stuck in my brain, so I have that imaginary audio.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere was a thread about the similar situation with mental images. I don't actually \"see\" anything when visualizing, however the thought is there. I don't describe the images in words either, it's just there, with no actual form, abstract. So, I feel like the question to those who claim to see images is: does closing your eyes actually help you picture something? For me it makes no difference whether or not they're open, as my \"mental image\" \"looks\" nothing like an actual image. It's just...super abstract. And, I don't consider myself to have any particular problems with creativity, since I enjoy drawing and painting quite a lot.",

I had some medical problems and during the testing we found out that i had increased pressure in my brain from a buildup of CSF from said concussion. I had a spinal tap to remove some of the CSF and relieve the pressure and now I have an internal monologue. My brain is empty now (in a good way) and I can THINK.

I simply don't use words in my inner thoughts unless words are the appropriate medium. \n\nI didn't realize I was any different than anyone else in this matter until I started learning other languages.  My fellow students would regularly do simple word-transliterations without taking the new languages' grammar and patterns in to account, and I was confused as to why.  $newlang isn't coded English, after all, it is its own thing, and has its own way of expressing things.  That's when I learned that many (most?) people think of a sentence in English first, then try to translate it.  This makes no sense to me.  I see it as you have an idea, *then* you need to access your language centers to convert the ethereal idea into the word/grammar structure of your choice.\n\nWhen I've talked about this with the folks who think in words, they look at me like I've grown a second head.  Apparently this mode of thought is as much a mystery to them as theirs is to me.  I don't feel like I'm missing anything- a constant stream of words in my head sounds exhausting!  As it is, I feel like my head is busy enough, I'm just thinking in a non-verbal manner.  Images, feelings, sensations, certainties, vagaries, that kind of stuff.",

My mom got me a cat to keep me company because I was stuck at home all the time. When we went to the shelter, he was just sitting still in his cage with his eyes closed, seemingly content. I saw him and asked the attendant if we could see him. She opened the cage and he came up to me and sniffed my hand and rubbed his face on my hand. I moved closer to the cage and he leaned up against my chest and purred while I pet him. So of course he was the one. \n\nTwo years later, he follows me around my apartment always sitting next to me. At night when I climb into bed he will be hanging out in the living room while I browse my phone. As soon as I put my phone down and turn off the light, I flip to my right side. Every night since I\u2019ve had him, he runs and jumps into my bed and lays down next to my chest, head resting on my arm. He will lay there until I fall asleep. Every morning, when I wake up he will hear me toss in my bed and run and jump in my bed to greet me. In an otherwise dynamic world that is always changing, he\u2019s been the one constant keeping me grounded.\n\nSo yeah, I do that too.\n\nEdit: [Cat Tax](https://imgur.com/a/pRX6asy)\n\nEdit: I didn\u2019t think about cropping out my foot until it was too late \ud83d\ude2c\n\nThank you for all the kind words and awards.

She had a broken fang and fleas, but no microchip, and nobody had posted her in the local missing pet groups.\n\nWe paid for her shots and flea treatment, and brought her home.

            "My dog sometimes sleeps with her eyes open, so usually if I'm watching her sleep for a while, it's to make sure she's still breathing. Totally creeps me out to see her lying there completely still like that, even though I know she's most likely just sleeping.",

In the morning I'll wake up and she'll be groggily standing by my head, and will want to get under the covers and lay her head on my chest before we get up. Sometimes I wake up and she's on the other side of the bed, under the covers, with her head on the pillow. I really lucked out with this one.",

            "A few years ago I was diagnosed with several health conditions. Including PTSD and BPD. I was told I needed to get a service dog to help with recovery. I told them that a dog wouldn't work for me the barking would be bad for me. \n\nI was told that the next best thing would be a tabby cat. I'm never alone now. And when the world is to much for me to take she is there cuddling into me purring because she knows it soothes me. We cower from fireworks together.\n\nShe comes and cuddles me every night when I go to bed and doesn't get back up till I'm asleep. \n\nWhen I don't have the strength to live for myself I still have it to live for her. \n\nI have a computer chair next to mine with fuzzy blankets so she can sit next to me while I game. She must know I suffer from chronic pain because she avoids sitting on my lap. Despite her clearly being torn by wanting to. \n\nShe doesn't yell at me and will give gentle taps to get my attention. She will use her nose to point to the thing she wants. At the oven for treats and the cupboard for food. \n\nAll she asks in return is food, hugs and playtime. I am beyond lucky to have her.",

            "My whole life I have had pet cats. I'm 100% a cat person. Because of a few different reasons I had to give up my sweet boy when I went to college. Well after college I moved in with my current long time boyfriend and he lives in an apartment that is strictly no pets. After a while I learned that not having a cat in my life was legitimately contributing to my depression. I remember my boyfriend and I would often talk about our dream cat that we wanted if we ever moved. Fast forward like 3 years later, and we are driving on the busiest road in my city getting fast food at like 1 am. On the way back we started arguing about something stupid that I honestly don't remember but he just randomly pulls the car over and I'm mad af thinking he's trying to kick me out of the car or something and he says \"did you not see that kitten?\" I immediately went into mother mode and got out of the car and saw her. She immediately ran up the hill and I was like wait kitty and she turned around and looked and me and got close enough to were I could grab her. As soon as I had her in my arms I knew she was my dream kitty even though she looked real bad (had all kinds of fleas and was really malnourished). We immediately stopped at CVS and bought her as much cat supplies as we could. Took her home to our no pets apartment and nursed her back to health. She is literally everything we dreamed for in a cat. I really think we manifested our kitty lol. I've hid her in the apartment successfully for the last two years now.",

            "I love my cat, but it's a cat, I had 4 before her, she's 14 years old, and as soon as she dies, we'll get another one. I had these kinds of thoughts for my children though.",

Clearly, you don't have children, but you know who do? The dumbasses. The fuckups. The ones who really shouldn't have kids.\n\nPlease, screw to save your species. Thanks.",
            "No. This is what happens when a society focuses so much on \"individualism\" than human relations and neighbourhood contacts are considered aberrations rather than the norm. Also explains the U.S' (and the collective West's) pseudo-imperialiastic bloodlust.",
            "No, I fucking hate my pet. Any time it makes noise or comes near me it think of how much I hate it and how disgusting animals are. People aren't lucky to have pets, pets are lucky to have people. Pets provide nothing of value and are more of a burden than not.\n\nI don't abuse my pet, but I really wish I didn't have one. For some reason my girlfriend enjoys its company or some shit, so I put up with it because she is worth it.",
