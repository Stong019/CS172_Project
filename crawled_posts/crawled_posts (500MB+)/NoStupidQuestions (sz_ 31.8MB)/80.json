It's side-effects aren't as severe and oftentimes require serious overdose to start to show. It's also a dependency that is much easier to break and long-term moderate use rarely correlates directly to medical issues due to low body accumulation and rapid break down in the liver. \n\nCompare caffeine to nicotine, which is a stimulant that is very addictive and a large portion of our population uses it. Only in the last 10-15 years have they really started to reduce the number of new cigarette smokers. And now with vaping and e-cigs the number of nicotine users is probably even higher. The reason nicotine was targeted was because it's primary delivery route was smoking versus caffeine which is water-soluble and easily consumed orally. The most common sources of nicotine have bad odors associated with them, whereas caffeine sources are fragrant like coffee or low volatility like soda, energy drinks, etc. Also, you drinking caffeine doesn't run the risk of someone getting second-hand consumption, unlike smoking. \n\nTL;DR:\nCaffeine consumption is generally less unhealthy than other stimulants and less impactful on those around the person. There aren't many reasons to restrict caffeine for people, adults should have the ability to self-evaluate and recognize if they are too dependent on caffeine.",

            "I am addicted to nicotine and soda which means caffeine and sugar but its specifically soda. Yes I consider it an addiction and I have to take it as seriously as heroin. If I don't drink soda, I feel thirsty and no amount of water will make it go away. I have serious withdrawal symptoms and of course like some other drugs, it has serious negative consequences to my health. I used to be in great shape and now well... I'm not. I've had lots more dental issues than I'd probably have had if I never got hooked on the stuff. Recently, I got on the nicotine patch. This is my third week and I feel confident I'm going to make it. Soda I'm still working on. There are a few contributing factors to your question. \n\nIn some cases its propaganda. The war on drugs hyperbolized things in some areas but people tend to take this to the extreme - either they think all drugs even marijuana result in death, crimes committed to get more, and uncontrollable cravings and withdrawal symptoms, or they believe no drug does any of this. Both of these extremes are 100% false. The truth depends on the drug and the individual. But the reason we don't treat caffeine the same is because its legal and therefore more socially accepted. It also has no age restrictions and that is important. We don't let kids smoke and so I think we associate that with the real dangers smoking poses and so while less severe than how we treat a heroin addict, many people shun and shame smokers. But kids drink soda. Kids sometimes drink coffee. As a result only the extremely health conscious has anything to say about it and its normalized. \n\nThe war on drugs has led as well to a vicious cycle. One reason for the war itself is that drugs are connected to crime, both in its distribution and crimes committed to obtain more. The irony is if you could buy your drug of choice at any convenience store for a reasonable price without legal repercussions both of these types of crimes would become rare. I won't say gone. I never robbed a store for a cigarette sure... But I've stolen from friends in the past. Both a couple bucks to buy a pack in my early 20s when money was very scarce or cigarettes out of their car without asking. I've done disgusting things in really hard circumstances including smoking discarded butts off the ground. When I recently decided to improve my life I calculated how much cigarettes and soda cost me and its well over 300 dollars a month. That is very significant especially in a job where I make under 30k. But because cigarettes are legal, while I take slack for it, its not the kind of \"slack\" someone doing an illegal drug would face. Despite anti-authoritarian stripes in our culture most people still believe if something is illegal it must be bad. In truth this may or may not be true, but something being legal does not make it good either and we need to take responsibility for ourselves. \n\nOne thing I learned though as an addict that I do think applies to much more serious drugs - I do not think for one second than shunning and shaming an addict works at all. Soda and cigarettes were a comfort habit, I did it more the worse I felt. When you make people feel like garbage, it drives them further towards the drug, the only thing that makes them feel good without judgement. Well meaning people in my life made things so much worse for me, and I can't imagine what its like for someone hooked on something more potent. My advice to loved ones with no experience with addiction trying to help an addicted person is to first listen, let them talk about why they do the drug, their attempts to quit, and what the challenges are. Quit assuming they can just stop anytime it doesn't work that way. Tell them you are there to help when they are ready and that you know they will quit. Tell them the reason you want them to quit isn't because they are a loser but because you want more time with them, you like and care about them and don't want to lose them. When they make the plunge, don't bother them with constant check ins on progress because frankly even talking about this right now is triggering a craving for me right this second. Instead as much as possible do other things with them they enjoy. When you quit an addiction you have to learn how to live again - you have to learn how to do everything you used to love doing but without the drug. You can help a lot in this area by doing those activities with them. Don't try to force your own \"healthy\" interests on them let them find their own passions. Lastly celebrate their victories heavily, do not dwell on their failures. It usually takes way more than one attempt.",

            "Because it\u2019s associated with productivity.  You can form an addiction or compulsive behaviors with anything.  People delve into work as a form of escapism sometimes and they\u2019re applauded as workaholics.  So it\u2019s a \u201cpositive\u201d addiction.  \nAnd because it\u2019s a \u201cpositive\u201d addiction, it\u2019s cheap and ever-present.  That\u2019s why you don\u2019t have people selling their parents tv for Starbucks, as one myopic redditor pointed out.  If coffee became illegal overnight, it would be wayyyy more expensive and hard to get and Id get my bottom dollar someone out there would steal a TV for some coffee beans.  \nAlso- as a recovering alcoholic/heroin addict, the \u201cwine mom\u201d stuff is wayyyy more frustrating than the coffee stuff.  Because it\u2019s the same damn chemical.  I was in line at the store the other day when a woman behind me was talking about how the wine she was buying was like crack and I just didn\u2019t even know where to start.  I used to share needles to bang rock/heroin mixtures in skid row but yeah I\u2019m sure that wine is just like it.  They talk about how they can\u2019t be talked to until they\u2019ve had their wine or whatever.  I had seizures from detoxing 3 separate times.  I was homeless and had to have some booze in the morning to avoid getting sick or having seizures.  And those same wine moms would scoff and call the cops.  And I was the one who really fucking needed it.  Anyway, blah blah blah rant but really I think it\u2019s mostly about productivity, therefore it being legal, therefore it\u2019s cheap and omnipresent, therefore you don\u2019t see the negative shit that surrounds other addictions, therefore it\u2019s again positively reinforced, restarting the cycle.",

But its a fun community, it has its voting system that filters most of the garbage we don't want to see away. You can use it to just simply browse through images of specific threads.

            "Oh absolutely. Imgur was my go to place for funny memes, social commentary and the latest news before I Started hanging out on Reddit all the time.

There is a front page with the most popular posts, so it is pretty easy to get quality content every day, and it is easy to navigate. There were always hundreds of comments on the most popular pics, and thousands of up/downvotes - my account gathered 80k karma on Imgur before I even knew Reddit existed.\n\nIn fact, I discovered Reddit thanks to Imgur. So many comments were complaining about Reddit sending us shit posts, I eventually looked up wtf Reddit was. That is how I ended up here.",

The other side is submitted content. Imagine a subreddit that hosted all of Reddit's posts and all voting and commenting was self contained. That wild west of social media is the content stream regular users of Imgur love.\n\nTo answer your question: I did use it like a social media hub. I was a prolific commenter for a year or two. The thing is, it's a flurry of wildly diverse, often fascinating or at least eyebrow raising content that you need to be concise in commenting about. Everything has an associated image so it's easy to get lost in. Especially when you consider that you can go through posts in seconds and be entertained. Or at least it was like that before Trump got elected. Now you can't go 5 posts without having someone moralising at you.",

I was so bothered by Orange upvotes for so long before I discovered Reddit was fun too.  \n  \nAnyway, to answer your question, stop submitting your images to gallery.  \nWhen you select that, it means you're posting it to Imgur for everyone to rate and see. You do not have to select to post it publicly to share your images on Reddit.   \n  \nImgur used to be more clear on that, now many of you make this mistake.  \n  \nI don't get the Reddit hate about Imgur when our front page is literally just videos and images for 90% of it.

I'd say mainly they feel that images are more accessible than Reddit's somewhat intimidating interface.\n\nI started getting annoyed by it and gradually browsed it less and less before getting on Reddit -- it started to feel corny and \"JV\".....and their dumb circlejerks are way dumber than Reddit's :P",

            "I've used Imgur for years to host images. That's how I originally found out about it, and I've always assumed it's why everyone else uses it. It has become pretty much the default free site for doing that. I think anything \"social media\" there is just window dressing.",

I left because one comment I made upset a bunch of neckbeards and I had a flurry of people call me a stupid bitch and a cunt and sent me sexually threatening messages. It wasn't fun after that.\n\nImgur, like many other sites, has a huge mob mentality to it. They sense weakened prey in the form of a downvoted comment and swarm it like mindless piranha. \n\nI've seen some of that here too, but it's mostly been innocuous, and there tends to be more critical thinking and allowance for divergence of opinion.

            "I started a new position at my job a few years ago and I worked with a guy and a girl in close proximity. Every day the girl would ask the guy if he saw anything good on imgur today. First few days I either misheard or or assumed she meant reddit. Nah bro, she fucking meant imgur!! Let me paint u a picture of this booger inhaling cretin. The girl was trained in first aid. This maniac from imgur was way into her and she made it clear she didn't feel the same way. One day another young gentleman who had a serious gf required first aid. But oh that made the cretin inhaling booger man very jealous, so he took a razor blade, walked right up to her and slashed his arm, so he would get his time with her. Also, he stalked her, in the parking lot and once followed her home. Once he did that, she reported him to management. They told him absolutely no contact, and moved him to another shift. He lasted two weeks without her before quitting. He also turned down a huge raise because it would mean he wouldnt be near her anymore to keep an eye on her (this is before management moved him). Oh, also he's exactly how u picture him. Spencer if u have found reddit, fuck u. Also after he was moved I asked the girl, \"why did u always seem so into him\", duh, she was afraid of him so she played nice. Sometimes I forget how different it is for girls. ",

            "Surgeon here. We will take occasional bathroom breaks every few hours (usually once or twice a 10-12 hr case), and then during the bathroom break you\u2019ll usually grab a protein bar or something else that\u2019s quick to eat but filling. There\u2019s always a PA, resident, or another surgeon with us in the OR for those long cases, so one person can easily step out for 5 minutes for a quick break.",
            "When I rotated on the transplant service I assisted with a liver transplant. Huge surgery. They spent a couple of hours prepping them and removing the liver. Felt weird seeing this huge, scarred, diseased liver being pulled out of this guy's abdomen. \n\nAfter it was out the surgeon did a little more work, and then we left. Just walked out and left the guy wide open with no liver. Took off the gloves and left the OR.\n\nWe went to the lounge and got some snacks and something to drink. I was wondering how long the patient was going to be like that. The surgeon explained that the OR crew had to swap out all the instruments, change out equipment, and prep the new liver. \n\nSo after about 20-30 minutes we headed back and finished. Took another several hours to put the new liver in. \n\nIt was an amazing process to watch and I feel lucky to have been involved. \n\n*Edit*  A lot of questions about this comment.  This happened 20 years ago when I was still in med school.  I am not a surgeon, I was just rotating on the service for a month.  My jobs during this particular surgery were to hold a retractor and maybe suction while the surgeon and chief resident actually did surgery.  I have no idea how common this particular scenario is and I'm sure things have changed a lot in the 20 years since it happened.",
            "Not a surgeon, but I had a 12 hour operation done on me. \n\nApparently the surgeon ate like half a dozen eggs and drank a gallon of water before it started. Then when they had to move me he left to go to the bathroom, eat more eggs, and drink more water. I don't exactly remember what the numbers were but I do remember that's what he did. ",
            "Surgery resident here. I haven\u2019t done a 20+ hour surgery, but i did do an 11 hour surgery once where we cut away all of the scar tissue that the intestines were tangled in (lysis of adhesions). We did get a break, but it was at the very end of the case when they were taking X rays of the abdomen prior to us closing it. I had like 10 min to pee and chug a big glass of water before coming back. That case sucked bc my neck started to spasm about an hour into the case to the point that I couldn\u2019t turn my head after. Part of that is the table height, which when you are learning with your attending who is taller than you, it can throw off the \u201coptimum height\u201d for you. It really sucks bc you can\u2019t really ever be like, yeah this is killing me. We usually only reserve that for if you are going to puke or pass out lol.",
            "Unrelated to the OP, but I\u2019ve seen a few comments talking about the egos that surgeons have and wanted to share (what I thought) was a funny story. My dad had emergency triple bypass surgery - was generally a healthy guy, never smoked, didn\u2019t drink, ate right and exercised and all the jazz. Turns out this was all stress and genetics related. Went in for a routine check up and wasnt allowed to leave. 52 at the time. \n\nNeedless to say, we were all pretty worried. Was the most stressful week of my life at least. \n\nAfter the surgery, which went well, for most heart surgeries (at least in this hospital) they give you a heart-shaped pillow that the patient is meant to clutch if they need to cough, or something like that. \n\nMy dad was still unconscious in the ICU so I was holding the pillow when the surgeon came in to discuss the operation. \n\nHe walks into the room, and before even sitting down just sort of casually blurts out that everything went fine, \u201cit was a relatively boring procedure\u201d, and beelines straight for me, pulls a marker out of his pocket, and signs the heart pillow. \n\nThis dude straight up thought he did such a great job that he autographed the pillow like he was a famous athlete or something. After taking a minute to process what just happened, I realized that I absolutely loved every second of it. That\u2019s the kind of cockiness I want when my life (or loved ones life) is on the line. ",
            "I've been in surgeries before that you get to a pause point and they'll cover the surgical field asks send everyone for bathroom breaks. There's always at least one surgeon scrubbed in at all times. \n\nSome of those really long cases will require teams of surgeons so that no one person is working straight. For example, separating conjoined twins may require vascular surgeons, neurosurgeons, plastic surgeons, etc. One team will finish their step and another team will take over. ",
            "About six years ago, an old friend of mine was in brain surgery for over 14 hours to remove a glioblastoma tumor.  When it was over, the surgeon came out to talk to us about how it went. At one point I asked him \"what happens if you have to go to the bathroom?\" He replied, \"I only drank a few sips of water this morning before heading into surgery.\" ",
            "My grandpop has a saying, I don't think it's his but yeah.\n\n> Eat when you can, sleep when you must, and never fuck with the pancreas",
            "Surgeon here. Albeit not a transplant surgeon (guys that do 20+ hour surgeries). Yes we can take breaks. Short ones. There\u2019s always an anesthesiologist in the room. They keep the patient alive and stable in the event that a surgeon has to the leave the room. Also there\u2019s scrub nurses and PA\u2019s. ",
            "The small breaks mostly we get are during the prep time, scrubbing, C-arm confirmation, machine failure, instrument and items replacement, etc. But for a long surgery we usually have replacement surgeons always ready by side. Very long surgeries like you asked 20+ hrs are carefully planned, so it includes breaks, rotations among doctors, and even planned out for other emergencies. But yeah we make ourselves to get mini breaks during parts of surgery. ",
            "The scrub techs and circulating nurses get rotated out for \u201clunch\u201d (it\u2019s lunch no matter the time of day), but the surgeon(s) stay the whole case, with short breaks for bathroom, quick drink/snack, or just a stretch - according to their own discretion and the specific demands of the case. There is no policy or rule governing when or how the surgeon does this - it\u2019s totally up to their own discretion. ",
            "I\u2019m a general surgeon. For exceptionally long surgeries, such as transplants or long cancer resections, some surgeons might take breaks. Usually they\u2019re very short, and rarely involve more than crackers and (usually bad) coffee. Generally after 8 hours you start thinking about it. \n\nIt\u2019s some weird mark of pride to not need to take breaks though, so everybody\u2019s a little different. \n\nIn terms of the pay, it\u2019s certainly a good wage, but in relation to the amount of time put in to become a surgeon (or any other doc), it\u2019s pretty low. I have friends who had greater than $500,000 in debt by the time they graduated; unless they\u2019re in a procedural field, they\u2019ll likely die in debt. Medical school is becoming more competitive every year, so you generally need better credentials to get in, and it\u2019s also more expensive every year.

I'm not at work, otherwise I'd get on the intranet and find the article.  But, he was dying of terminal cancer and had reached the point where he was too weak to stand for the lengthy surgeries he would perform.  He was still perfectly capable of doing these surgeries, he just couldn't stand.  So this fuckin' badass had a support frame built to hold him up so he could continue to work.  ",

Operating is tiring enough, mentally taxing enough we shouldn\u2019t be making it worse for ourselves and our colleagues just to make a point that we can do it.\n\nIf it\u2019s over about 8hrs then I verbally discuss when I want the breaks with my team - needs to be a stable point when I have my break, but for our juniors it can be when there is a slow part of the operation that is non-critical and doesn\u2019t need much assisting. There are quite a few parts of operations when I don\u2019t really need any one helping, though its nice. I find it disappointing when a junior says they don\u2019t need a break - you\u2019re not proving yours strong, you\u2019re suggesting you have poor judgment.\n\nThe most times I\u2019ve ever seen a surgeon unscrub was 12x in a 5 hour operation - he had a cold and either his mask kept filling up with snot or he couldn\u2019t breath.

            "I work as a cardiac ICU nurse so not a surgeon and I don't work in theatres but I have seen a few open heart ops as an observer. Open heart surgery can last anywhere from about 4 to 12+ hours depending on the surgery and any complications. Usually a lot of the work is done by the junior surgeons, so the opening of the chest and establishing the patient on bypass, then the consultant scrubs in and will perform the main bulk of actually operating on the heart with the juniors assisting. Once the heart has been operated on the consultant will often leave the closing of the chest to the juniors and will just supervise or be on hand for complications. In the total time of the surgery each doctor will be working for a few straight hours with short breaks. I guess it's possible to go out and come back in but remember that the process of getting scrubbed is quite long and must be done each time. All the other people who aren't scrubbed are free to come and go from the OR.",

Of course they do it when pt is stable and bleeding under control. \n\nBut I\u2019ve seen surgery for 6-8 hours and surgeons didn\u2019t take a break at all. So it also depends on them. \n\nDon\u2019t forget the Anesthesiologist who also has to be present in the OR for the duration of the surgery! Surgeons don\u2019t always have to be in the room but there always have to have anesthesiologist in OR at all times. Anesthesiologists give break to each other in the OR.",

I got a lunch but was relieved by another in my same position. I really can't imagine doing a 20hr case. After the 8 I was wiped out, even with the break.\n\nI'd imagine it'd be in the best interest of the patient to take a break for food at some point. An extra 30min under anesthesia would be much less harmful than a slip of the hand/mind caused by going that long without food. ",
            "Hi. I\u2019m a 4th year medical student going into a tough surgical subspecialty. Here\u2019s what I know:\n\nWhen you\u2019re in a surgery, especially a very long one, you will always have someone else \u201cscrubbed in\u201d with you (meaning wearing a sterile gown and gloves over their scrubs and allowed to touch the sterile field). If nature calls and you need to go to to the bathroom, you pretty much always can. You just \u201cbreak scrub\u201d, take care of your business, then come back and put a new gown and gloves on and keep going. Most parts of most surgeries are not time sensitive so you can take a break if you need to. If it\u2019s a really long case and there\u2019s a natural stopping point, the attending surgeon may tell the operating team (attending, resident, PA, medical student, etc) to take a 10 minute break for water/bathroom/food. \n\nThe nursing side of the equation consists of the scrub tech (who is scrubbed in and hands the surgeon instruments and assists with things as necessary) and the circulator nurse (who is not scrubbed in and handled anything outside of the sterile field that needs to be taken care of) who are spelled off by relief staff quite frequently so that stamina does not diminish over the course of the case/day. The anesthesia staff also are frequently spelled off for the same reason. \n\nThere will be times where people won\u2019t take breaks. Surgeons are generally of a breed where breaks are not taken lightly or unnecessarily. That\u2019s just the mentality. I remember a 12+ hour bowel resection case where the resident and I stayed scrubbed in the entire time. Had we needed to take a break we could have, we just didn\u2019t need to. \n\nPeople are talking about relative pay for different specialities so I\u2019ll address that too:\n\nIn general, surgeons are paid more than non surgeons but it\u2019s not as clean cut as that. A better answer would be the procedural specialties (where you do procedures in addition to seeing patients and prescribing medicine) will pay better than non precedural specialties. This is why specialties like cardiology, gastroenterology, anesthesiology, dermatology, and interventional radiology, while not surgical specialties, will pay as much as if not more than some surgical fields and most non-surgical fields. \n\nThe highest paid doctors are neurosurgeon and orthopedic surgeons on an average yearly basis. The highest paid doctors on a pay per hours worked basis are likely dermatologists and gastroenterologist. Pretty much no one goes into a field like neurosurgery or orthopedic surgery for the money as you\u2019re working ridiculous hours with frequent call, especially during their (long) residencies. That\u2019s why fields like gastroenterology and dermatology are so competitive - you\u2019re still making a lot of money (in doctor standards) and you\u2019re working about 2/3 of the hours as the surgeon. \n\nAny questions just ask! ",
            "That\u2019s what Medicaid paid a friend of mine for an appendectomy. \n\nBack when my dad first started practicing, he was once paid 32\u00a2 by Medicaid for some procedure he did, via a mailed letter with a 37\u00a2 postage stamp. \n\nMany doctors are going the employed route now (and losing autonomy) in order to get more stable (and arguably better) pay. But many of us then get treated like interchangeable cogs in a system which is run by business men with little to no medical knowledge, who care predominantly for the bottom line. ",
            "They do but not as much as they should. We worked from 8 am until 4 pm the next day on back to back cases with meal breaks (between cases) but with only two hours from 6 an-8 am) of sleep. I was numb towards the end.

Anesthesiologist saw us and was like \u201c even a truck driver isn\u2019t allowed on the road if he doesn\u2019t sleep certain number of hours\u201d  \nBut this doesn\u2019t happen once or twice a month tho ",

            "I remember when reddit first implemented gold, IIRC it was a while after they were bought by Conde Nast, and the impression I got was that they were on their books as a huge money sink with absolutely no income, and in that moment they basically said \"hey guys, we need some money, we don't know what we're offering as compensation, but if you help us out we'll get you back\"\n\nAnd the response was *overwhelming*, they thought they'd put out this option and in a few months they'd have *some* money, but the response was so overwhelming that they came back a day or two later and said \"holy crap! Thanks guys we're good!\" I think they shut the entry window within the week. The compensation they eventually got was reddit gold, at first there were a few cool features, it would show you new comments on threads you'd previously read, you'd get an inbox if your name was /u/ mentioned, there was a special sub you could only get into with gold (totally just shit posting being wealthy and having money to spend on frivolity). \n\nFor people like me, thats what I think of when I think of gold, reddit being in it's beginning, not yet cash positive but with a massive user base that loved it enough to throw cash at it because they wholesomely and genuinely asked and needed it. It makes sense that it would evolve into a more perfunctory, business model, and it does take the soul out of the fun, but remember that at the time, Digg (lol Digg) was making money by selling ads which reddit has done mercifully sparingly, and Ebaums world had a monthly subscription program that was only used by hardcore users. These websites had no way to get money on the books, this novel way of \"hey, the service will be the same regardless, same content, nothing behind a paywall, but if you want to give us money whenever you can whenever you want, we would really appreciate it\" really struck a cord. \n\nNow reddit has a source of income and 90% of the user-base will never have to pay for anything because 10% find it worth while to spend $3 to have a little icon next to a post they like. They seems like a fair and amicable solution to me.",

My wife is in cancer recovery so going out and getting any old job just wasn't an option. So bring poor, Ive never had the money to buy awards and as such always thought they were pointless.\n\nBut a month or two back I got a couple of silvers and another award and it felt really nice that someone thought my post was worth awarding. It made me feel really happy. Since, I've been able to pass the silver on and that also felt great. So whilst I do not think they have any real value, if someone has spare cash and they want to pass awards out, I don't feel we should judge them for that. Giving feels good.\n\nI saw someone get mad at getting an award the other day because they felt the money would be better donated to BLM causes. I get that point of view, but maybe, like me, those people had silver to share, and awarded posts tend to get way more views. If the post is saying important things, awarding it may make more people see it.\n\nI'd personally like to see people stop giving awards to shitty comments that are just \"F\" or an extremely well worn Internet trope, but people will always do what they want.",

            "Dear Reddit Community,\n\nIt is with a heavy heart that I write this farewell message to express my reasons for departing from this platform that has been a significant part of my online life. Over time, I have witnessed changes that have gradually eroded the welcoming and inclusive environment that initially drew me to Reddit. It is the actions of the CEO, in particular, that have played a pivotal role in my decision to bid farewell.\n\nFor me, Reddit has always been a place where diverse voices could find a platform to be heard, where ideas could be shared and discussed openly. Unfortunately, recent actions by the CEO have left me disheartened and disillusioned. The decisions made have demonstrated a departure from the principles of free expression and open dialogue that once defined this platform.\n\nReddit was built upon the idea of being a community-driven platform, where users could have a say in the direction and policies. However, the increasing centralization of power and the lack of transparency in decision-making have created an environment that feels less democratic and more controlled.\n\nFurthermore, the prioritization of certain corporate interests over the well-being of the community has led to a loss of trust. Reddit's success has always been rooted in the active participation and engagement of its users. By neglecting the concerns and feedback of the community, the CEO has undermined the very foundation that made Reddit a vibrant and dynamic space.\n\nI want to emphasize that this decision is not a reflection of the countless amazing individuals I have had the pleasure of interacting with on this platform. It is the actions of a few that have overshadowed the positive experiences I have had here.\n\nAs I embark on a new chapter away from Reddit, I will seek alternative platforms that prioritize user empowerment, inclusivity, and transparency. I hope to find communities that foster open dialogue and embrace diverse perspectives.\n\nTo those who have shared insightful discussions, provided support, and made me laugh, I am sincerely grateful for the connections we have made. Your contributions have enriched my experience, and I will carry the memories of our interactions with me.\n\nFarewell, Reddit. May you find your way back to the principles that made you extraordinary.\n\nSincerely,\n\nNABDad",

            "I got ten years on you and that's how I feel.\n\nWhen you're young, you see your parents as \"adults\" in such a totality. They feed you, they have jobs, they do all the grown-up things. They can \"do whatever they want\" but never do anything crazy. As a child, we start to feel like this must mean grown-ups are just so different from children because otherwise why aren't they doing all those crazy things we'd do when we grew up?\n\nThen you start aging and begin to fall into those routines, but since you're not \"comfortable\" with them and still wish you could do youthful things there's a feeling that you're not \"there yet.\" You feel like you're acting in a role because your parents did what they did but never seemed out of place in it. What you don't see is that they were the same as you, they just didn't show it to their kid.\n\nThere's also a bit of a generational thing. A lot of our parents lived in a time where if you went to college at all, it wasn't brutally expensive and you were guaranteed a pretty nice job once you got out. Moreover, the housing market hadn't erupted and wages were better. They were able to dive into the world of \"adulthood\" more freely than their children. You could be a high school graduate and get a job that let you live on your own. You could be 24 and buy a house with a wife and a kid and this wasn't an insane luxury, it was the normal pace.\n\nCombine it all and it's not hard to see why so many in their 20s and 30s feel like imposters, like pretend adults.",

            "In some ways, yes, but I wouldn't call it \"playing.\"\n\nReally, in the US and a lot of modern societies, we tend not to do a great job of marking that transition. A lot of cultures have (or had) coming-of-age ceremonies where they'd set out what was expected of you as an adult and ritualistically have you make that step into the community as a full member. In the Jewish faith you have Bar Mitzvahs, in Ancient China you had capping ceremonies, in indigenous societies you might have had a trial, whatever. When you came out of it, you stepped across a social and societal threshold defined by the ritual and emerged in a new role.\n\nWe don't really have that. The closest we have is, like, maybe getting your driver's license? Or losing your virginity? *Maybe*  high school or college graduation? But those are more ersatz coming-of-age ceremonies than anything, I think, and only the graduation is an actual ceremony of any kind. We use them because, I think, we as humans *want* a dividing line there, but our society basically doesn't have one.\n\nSo we're just kinda tossed into this sudden, vague status of being \"adults\" without much of a recognized boundary line, and more or less left to figure out just what being an adult means to us. To some, it might mean your first car, or your first apartment, or getting into your first career, or even your first marriage or your first child. And until you hit that point, it seems like you're dealing with all of the associated accretia of \"adulthood\" (taxes, loan payments, living by yourself, organizing your own life) without a recognition that you've crossed a boundary. There's no ceremony that says, \"now you're an adult and this is what this means to our society,\" there's just.. doing stuff. \n\nSooner or later, without recognizing how, you just end up having to do the stuff you associated with adulthood just to keep bad things from happening. And then it becomes second nature.\n\nSo I'm not sure if it's \"playing\" as such\u2014but I get the strong feeling that a lot of people \"fall into\" being an adult (myself included) just because there's an ever-increasing number of things you have to do. But we never make a distinction or a boundary between not having to do something and then suddenly being responsible for it. We just stumble upon it. \n\nAnd I think that sense of stumbling is something that unnerves us a bit. Coming-of-age ceremonies and rituals are so commonly found, so pervasive in human societies, that (to me) it really does seem like there's something in us that recognizes a distinction between what we would call growth and adulthood and longs for a recognized boundary between the two, a guiderail of social responsibility and duty. Our society just doesn't seem to have an explicit one. It's like we've lost a kind of social guide rail, so now we're blindly feeling around for what we are and what to do.",

Adulthood is knowing that you should hit your friend that wears glasses in their back with a snowball so you don't knock the glasses off their head. :)",
            "I definitely have that. I think it stems from thinking, as a kid, that adults knew it all. I now know my parents and other role models often had doubts and uncertainty, but never seeing it I thought they were either all-knowing or bad people (i.e.: I now recognize and understand some bad decisions relatives made - as a kid I thought they had simply done a *bad thing*. My cousin didn't do heroin because she was bad, she did heroin because she fell in with the wrong crowd and the only people in the world who treated her with any respect all did heroin).\n\nNow that I'm 31 I still have that unattainable expectation of adult wisdom at the back of my mind. I'm the exact age my dad was when I was born. I'm the age my mom was when I was 4. So I basically remember them omnipotent, all-knowing gods at the exact same age that I'm still struggling with getting out of bed in time to get to work, and wrestling between \"yeah definitely eat that donut\" and \"no man you should be *losing* a few pounds, not gaining.\" I never saw my parents struggle with trying to decide if they should change fields and work their way up from the bottom again, or what to do with their investments, or how much to spend on groceries or a car. I never saw my parents not get work done because they were too busy laughing hysterically at a stupid goddamn cat video. I never saw adults awkwardly torn between going around to say hi to people they don't know and just wanting to shrink into a hole and drink in the corner. I'm sure they occasionally went to work and didn't feel like doing anything either, but they sure didn't come home and tell me that.\n\nI think I see a similar pattern in my friends. We're all in our late 20s or early 30s, but we still don't have life figured out. We still joke about how we're just teenagers with our own apartments and cars, and how instead of being responsible we still chortle at stupid memes. \n\nThe danger, in my opinion, is that the *idea* of adulthood masks the real progress we're all making towards our life goals. I feel 22, but at 22 I was much less wise and mature than I am now. We still all feel like we're trapped in perpetual immatueity, but it probably has more to do with unrealistic expectations. I'm sure there was no age at which my parents suddenly stopped enjoying screwing around and started taking care of business. I'm sure there's no age at which I will ever be convinced I will either. But somehow it still fundamentally feels like I should. ",

I took her to my bedroom and showed her, dude, look. This is what it\u2019s like to be an adult, if you so choose to take my route. I have random stuffed animals around, I watch a lot of cartoons, I get to choose to eat whatever I want within reason, no one can tell me when to go to bed, no one can get on me about what I\u2019m doing on the internet.\n\nFrom that perspective, being a grown up isn\u2019t so bad.

I live and let live and don't get all angry about dumb things. The difference becomes apparent though when I hang out with someone in their mid/late 20s. They are just less experienced at life, and it shows. Not a bad thing, just at different stages of growth. I bet if you spent some time with people 6-10 years younger, you'd notice a difference, too.",
            "Among the many types and groups of people out there, here are some I believe have significant populations:\n\nPeople who're certain they're personally behind the curve, while also assuming most other adults similar to their age/experience have things pretty well figured out. I would call them Consciously Incompetent.\n\nPeople who have worked at getting better at life/adulting/whatever, and continue to monitor their progress. They have certain things well-in-hand, and look to improve and expand their knowledge and skill-set. The Consciously Competent.\n\nPeople who actually have a solid grasp on life to the point they just do what needs to be done and thrive. They've been doing the right things for so long, they're basically on autopilot. The Unconsciously Competent.\n\nAnd those who act or behave as though they've got all life's secrets in their back pocket and walk around with unjustified self-confidence. But you personally wouldn't trust them with anything more dangerous than unbuttered toast. The Unconsciously Incompetent. \n\nThat still leaves those who are worried they're just sort of faking their way through life. They still want to do the things that made them happy when they were younger, but somehow don't believe those things are valid in the eyes of their peers any longer. They feel like at any time they'll be discovered as faking-it to get by. They feel unqualified in their position or situation, as though The Real Grown-ups In Charge will one day catch on to the subterfuge. I call these people Quietly Competent, Lacking Confidence.\n\nTo those people, my fellow people, I say this... I figured out people in our group tend to care more, to work harder to get it right, to be completely willing to fix a mistake when one happens, and generally be more conscientious. That's not a bad kind of person to be.\n\nAnd those people who end up actually in charge of things, handling big projects, placed in high ranking and prominent positions, the ones who really seem to have it all together...? They don't have superpowers. They're not some special breed of human. \n\nThey're just as likely to be the kid in Kindergarten who smelled funny and ate glue. \n\nSo, work on your conscious competence. Try to be a little bit better version of yourself today than you were yesterday, and even a little more tomorrow. Don't pretend to be someone else or abandon who you are. Just intend to work at expanding who you are, to become more consciously competent each day. And sooner than later, you'll be the one everyone else assumes has it all together....\n\nAnd they'll be right.",

It's a lot easier to replace a screw than a screwdriver.\n\nEdit: a lot of people are getting an idea which is not the idea I intended to put across but the wording is kind of ambiguous. When I say that a screw is a lot easier to replace than a screwdriver, I mean in the sense that you can buy screws in bulk, whereas screwdrivers are just a little pricier - ergo it's less of a drain on your wallet to replace a screw than a screwdriver. I have replaced stripped screws before, and it was hard - and that was with screws that protruded from the work surface that I could get to with a Dremel sander, after a bit of wrangling.",

Buy a box of 100 screws, and end up using up 25 screwdriver bits at $5 each trying to use them all. Since many kinds of screws, like deck screws and other construction screws are really mean to be used once and left in place through perpetuity, them stripping out on the way in isn't a major bad thing. \n\nFor machine screws, usually those are hardened according to their projected remove/reinstall schedule. IMO, some products use really soft screws so that they're essentially a one-time use; they go in at the factory and you'll strip the head out trying to remove them on your own. Thus, the object isn't user-serviceable and will either need professional repair or outright replacement. In this way, the screws become tamper proof...unless you're a smart person who knows that a hacksaw or dremel tool can make ANY screw a slotted head screw. Even this doesn't erase that they're one-time use; if the heads are that soft, the rest likely isn't much more durable so the threads are probably megaborked.",

Grade 8 is the happy medium.\n\nyou'll find harder bolts in things like buildings where they aren't jostled/shocked by the bumping and moving of a vehicle.\n\nthey still use the phillips because of ubiquity.

And then we get upset when it's a cheap product.\n\nI'm a QC Tech for an aftermarket auto parts distributor. There's a very fine balance between quality of product and price. Yeah of course we could get buy some super amazingly made parts from a high end factory. But who would buy an aftermarket part for a price close to OEM. So what you end up doing is paying AS LOW AS POSSIBLE for a product that is JUST good enough to be usable until atleast the warranty period. We don't do it maliciously in order to again sell a new part once the warranty is over. It is because we have to sell the cheapest product we can in order for people to even purchase it. And since people always want the cheapest product, that limits how much quality the part can actually have.\n\nI'm the QC tech so my job is making sure we sell the best product we can. I test and sign off on whether or not a part is good enough to sell. But I don't decide which parts we order, only if the ones we are going to get are acceptable enough to sell.\n\nIf you want to sell the most you want to sell for the least. You just need to keep the percentage of returns under a certain rate or else it also can't sell because it gets returned too much and costs too much money in warranties and end users not wanting it since it keeps breaking. Make the product super good in where it has a nigh zero return rate, then no one will want to buy it because it's so expensive even if it could last forever. Again, it's a balancing act. \n\nNot to mention if a company makes a product that never breaks and works forever. They no longer ever sell anything and so then there's no more company. If that was indeed possible to make a product so good it lasted forever without repair. I'm not sure which companies do or don't make their products with planned obsolescence. But either way that is what warranty times are for. A company warranting a product is basically saying that that is how long the part should work for before it breaks. Warranties have to be considerate of how much it will cost the company issuing the warranty. Warranty too many returns and it costs too much for the company and they go under. So they keep it right up to the average time of obsolescence. Cheaper products usually have shorter warranties with much stricter policies. While you will notice higher quality products usually have long warranty times and even \"no questions asked\" policies. \n\nThat's where speciality products come in. Companies who make extremely high end expensive low supply items. People who want quality over anything will of course pay top dollar for the best product. \nBut the average consumer isn't going to buy specialty expensive products, they just want savings and for it to work to an acceptable manner.\n\nIn your example you mention rounded off screw heads and being annoyed by them. Have you ever gone out to find specialty screws from a mom and pop store or do you just continue to buy the same cheapo bulk pack from a Walmart or Home Depot. Enough said.\n\n\n\n**TLDR: It's all up to what customers are willing to pay and how good you can make it for that cost. People always gravitate to easy to read savings on individual purchases, over not as easily quantifiable quality of product over time.**",

I'd guess anything you add to your brain from outside is going to mess with your brains chemistry and lead to death.\n\nEdit to add the above assumption is based on the idea that we are talking about outside a hospital/situation without professional medical supervision.",

Brain cells and their action potentials are extemely delicate, so much so that even Blood is too toxic to their function and has to be carefully controlled by the capillaries through the blood-brain barrier.\n\nIt IS possible to do brain surgery and invasive operations with the client conscious. In fact, it's useful for measuring cognitive tasks. But I can't say what'd happen cognitively.\n\nI'll tell you this, ~~it would probably look almost nothing like getting drunk.~~If anything it'd more closely resemble extremely botched and imprecise brain Lesions.\n\nEdit: just asked my drugs and nervous system professor. I was partially right. The vodka would flood the gabanergic receptors and get you absolutely wasted!\n\n...until the cell immediately dehydrates due to the alcohol dehydrating things inherently.

            "Two issues here.\n\ni) vodka is hypotonic.  This would cause brain swelling due to osmosis.  Probably not an issue because I'm guessing that the skull is open (and a shot is quite small).  If via magic it was applied to a brain still enclosed in the skull the swelling could cause some issues.  Hard to predict how severe, probably at least disorientation or coma.  Death happens when too much hypotonic solution is added to the body, exactly [due to brain swelling](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/16614865/ns/us_news-life/t/woman-dies-after-water-drinking-contest/).\n\nii) Ethanol is toxic to nerves.  In fact external application is commonly used in biomedical research to [denervate blood vessels](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1443950619313526?via%3Dihub) (i.e. kill the nerves on the blood vessels).  Adding vodka (i.e ethanol), would cause nerve/brain cell death.  This would mostly affect the [cerebral cortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex) (outer section) of the brain.  \n\nThe exact consequence would be hard to predict, and would depend on which areas of the cortex the vodka was poured on, how many cells were affected, and if any ethanol would \"leak\" down to other parts of the brain.  I think the top comment describing Dahmers victims would be a good guess.  i.e. a couple days in a catatonic state, immediate convulsions, coma, death.   Although I would not be surprised with milder symptoms, maybe akin to a stroke (because a shot is fairly small).  \n\nWe don't really know because no one has tried this before.",

Would that cause large scale brain damage?  Hard to say because the wiring is different for everyone.  But you would definitely do some harm and after that they might get some of the effects of the alcohol as it absorbed into their body, but it would likely happen too slowly for it to be as impact as if they have consumed it normally.   \n\n\nPlus, they'd be all traumatized from you having cut their skull open while they're awake and all that, so likely one shot isn't going to improve anything.",

            "80 proof vodka is probably strong enough for direct neurotoxicity (typically 95% ethanol is used for ablation therapy with instillation into cysts in other organs, neurons are a bit more delicate), but that's assuming the meninges have been retracted off the brain as well, they're relatively impermeable. It would likely be devastating, but probably not immediately fatal to the person.
