            "A lot of people have given the \"sex sells\" answer, and that's true to a degree, but there's another element as well:  For a lot of the people making these shows, Netflix represents a large amount of creative freedom compared to network TV or cable.  Some might have worked with HBO or done film, but this is the first time they've said \"I want to shoot a sex scene\" and had the network respond \"sure, go nuts.\"\n\nLike a teenager going off to college, they're flexing a lot of that newfound autonomy by branching out, testing their limits in a lot of ways, shooting scenes they wanted to in the past but got shot down.  Sometimes that's sex scenes, sometimes it's something that requires the audience to pay rapt attention, other times it's something as mundane as odd camera angles or tricks of cinematography.  As people make multiple Netflix shows, they'll probably get used to the new format and evolve their style.",

            "This has annoyed me for so long. Like others are saying, this phenomenon isn't new, but it has certainly become a very popular tactic in Netflix. What pisses me off the most is when they prominently place an unnecessary sex scene in the first episode of a show. Like, if you have to inject a sex scene in the very first episode of a show, how is that not just a risque distraction from the fact that the plot either sucks or is unimaginative? It's the pilot, the time you get to paint the plot of your story and introduce the characters and their motivations. In my experience, a pilot is tough because you have a limited amount of time to share a lot of information and intrigue the viewer, so if you have the spare time to inject a completely pointless sex scene, then you should have spent more time working on your shitty plot. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut, alas, it works. Sex sells. And for the people who are genuinely stimulated by television series sex scenes enough to ignore the shortcomings of the plot: I'm sorry that you've neither had sex nor heard of porn."

            "I have kept many fish so far. And I didn't cry over their death... except for one... because that one was my own fault of  not being careful enough. She jumped out of the aquarium and I didn't saw it until it was to late. I still put her back, immidiatly got medicine and tried my best to keep her alive, but she was already to dry (it was a beta).\n\nWhile most people don't cry over their fishes. THEY DON'T LET THEM STARVE TO DEATH. This just shows missing empathy and is a huge red flag, imo",

            "I once lost a beta fish, and I was trying really hard to take care of it. I\u2019m still not sure to this day why it died, but did. I felt bad, but I didn\u2019t cry over the fish or mourn it. Like, I wanted it to thrive and I did care about it, but I\u2019m not going to lie and say I was as emotionally attached to it as I would a dog or cat.\n\nThat being said, what I am disgusted by is not the lack of emotional attachment, but the fact this person elected to take a thing under their care, and they neglected it, and didn\u2019t feel bad about THAT. It\u2019s a living thing that probably died a very slow and horrible death because of their inability to take responsibility.",
            "A lot of people do not take fish seriously as pets. I do think it's pretty terrible. Obviously there are worse things in the world, but a living thing is a living thing and when you assign yourself the responsibility to care for one, they deserve to be at least minimally cared for.",

            "I once had a female roommate who was so distraught over a goldfish that was dying (and probably already dead) at 1 in the morning that she called a vet, a hospital and finally 911.

But given the choice of the two, I would rather be friends with someone who cares about animals too much than a soulless human with no concern at all for one of nature's gifts to us.",

Yes, it was just a fish, but what if it was you struggling, \"Oh, it's just Most-transition, who cares?\".

So - not marriage material.\n\nWhen I went on long vacation, I gave my coworker keys to my office and asked her to feed my fish while I was gone.  Another time I had a $3 white cory catfish which are even cheaper than some goldfish. When I moved and relocated to another state, I put him in a bucket in the front seat of my car with a battery travel aerator, and took him with me on the long road trip, because he's my pet and I made an agreement to take good care of him.\n\nBeta fish are intelligent and have emotions by the way. I had one that liked to be pet. And when I got home from work and called him, he came to his name and would get excited and wiggle like a puppy when it saw me. \n\nAnd yes, normal people who are not lacking empathy care about small creatures including fish. My little tree frog accidentally escaped and died because of being dried out. When I found him, I cried buckets like my cat died.",

            "Totally unacceptable. I had a similar terrible situation with a patient of mine. She said her kids really wanted a snake, so she got them a snake. However, she and her husband hated feeding it mice and were grossed out. So they just stopped feeding the snake and it starved to death. And she fucking *laughed* while telling this story. The worst part of it all is she was a fucking *pediatric nurse*. Like holy shit, you work with kids and handle their health for a living and you think it's funny that you starved your pet to death? How does someone with no empathy work with kids for living?? Don't get an animal if you're not going to take care of it properly.\n\nOP's girlfriend's attitude reminds me of how people view hamsters and other rodents too. Just because an animal is small doesn't mean it doesn't matter, especially if you *choose* to buy it and take it into your care.",

I left for the weekend, ensured the tank was clean, it had food, etc. I came back to find him with a really bad case of fin rot and despite medication in the water, it was soon clear he was going to die. I had to euthanize him (with clove oil) because I couldn\u2019t see him suffering any longer. It still haunts me years later when I think of it.

If she had taken measures for her fish to be fed, looked after and it still died, she tried, no foul, but to leave it to starve to death... What an awful woman.",
            "Is it the end of the world to lose a $4 fish? No. Is it absolutely monstrous to be that callous about *starving an animal that relied on her for survival*? Yes, yes it is. You are right to be disgusted with her statement.",

That pesky human ego gets in the way. I came up with a few phrases to keep in my pocket for these situations. \"Ok, but only because I choose too.\" \"You know what I hate? Those moments when someone asks you to do something you were already going to to do, but it no longer seems like you had initiative because you were told to do it.\" (Grabbing the bull by the horns with that one) \"Hey you know what would be a good idea?

A good way to do this is to remember that you cannot control your parent's reactions. No matter what you do, likely your mom will remain convinced that she needs to order you around.

            "This is studied all the time in psychology. It\u2019s called the over-justification effect. It\u2019s normally studied in the context of how to design reward systems so that they don\u2019t decrease intrinsic motivation, but that principle applies here. Often times when someone is given an external motivation to do something, it decreases their inherent desire to do it for themselves. When your mom orders you to do something, your brain interprets that as an indication that the activity must not be worth doing just for the sake of doing it, as otherwise your mom\u2019s command would not be needed. \n\nAn alternative explanation is that we simply don\u2019t like to do things because others want us to do them. We like resisting outside influences. Most likely, it\u2019s a combination of several factors, as studies often produce conflicting results. There\u2019s a great benefit to figuring this problem out, because understanding it will help us design reward programs that don\u2019t harm intrinsic motivation.",

Some of what you need to do in terms of papers and other mechanics depends on where you live, but it has general advice on that sort of thing.\n\nYou are also dealing with shock and loss and grief. It is normal for this sort of thing to \"knock you back\", it is normal to feel overwhelmed and  helpless. If you have friends, lean on them. If not, you might consider seeking out some grief counseling, someone to talk to to talk out how you feel and be reassured you aren't crazy, or abnormal, or overreacting. You need to take care of you while you take care of the death of your mother.  I am sorry this happened like this, and for your loss.\n\nWhere I live, the court system section that deals with estate had a booklet outlining how to handle an estate -- it explained terminology, laws, rules, etc. If your mother didn't leave much money, you might try to do this yourself instead of hiring a lawyer to do it.\n\nWhether you do it yourself or not, you'll need to gather paperwork. A will if she had one. Any life insurance policies. Any evidence of creditors -- mortgage company, any loans she had taken out. Any evidence of income -- social security, pensions, withdrawals from retirement accounts. Any evidence of bank or brokerage accounts where she might have had money. Whether you use a lawyer or not, you will need to gather the paperwork for all these things; if someone else needs to look at them, make copies, do not let go of originals unless required to by law (in which case YOU keep a copy).\n\nI gather you don't expect to live in her house, where you might keep the dogs. There are rescue groups that might help placing them in other homes.\n\nPost back with more specific questions. There is some help and advice available here.",

Do you have anyone who could help with her pets? If not, try local shelters, it won't be the easiest thing for you to do, but they'll be able to help. \n\nDo whatever you feel like doing, until you have some more clarity. Want to sleep? Get your favourite blanket. Same with food. And Don't be too hard on yourself. (The night I found my dad, I just wandered around the supermarket for hours) \n\nOnce you have the death certificate, you can begin with practicalities, find a funeral director first, they'll walk you through everything. Including registering her death. If your concerned about finances, there's usually funds that will help with funaral costsdepending on where you live.\n\nOnce the funeral is out the way, you can think about her estate and belongings. Find a solicitor, and they will be able to help with all the ins and outs. Usually first appointments are free. Before you go to a solicitor appointment, have a look for any wills or other important documents. The process will be easier with these. But not impossible without. \n\nAnd lastly, look after yourself. Don't try and do everything in one go or you'll burn yourself out. Take time to enjoy memories and speak to anyone you can about her. \n\nSending you loads of love. Please feel free to dm me if needed x",

Yes, get a death certificate from your jurisdiction. Talk to a family lawyer or estate lawyer. If you don't find a will, your jurisdiction (city or county) may have it on file. If your mother was very careful she may have done that. But it sounds like she died suddenly, so maybe not.\n\n\n2. The house is yours now. Do you want it? If so, there are a few things to consider. When your apartment lease is up, move into the house. \n\n2A.  If you don't want the house, sell it and keep whatever money is left over. Where I live, it's pretty easy to get a cash as-is offer. Many companies can do this online. It is probable that the house is worth more than she owed, so you walk away with cash. \n\n3. Either way, sell or donate everything of hers you don't want to keep. There are companies in my area who will arrange all that for you - they just auction the good stuff and clear everything else away so that you don't have to deal with it. Don't let things just sit there. It will never be easy. Note: no one wants to buy used clothes, books, dishes, or housewares. Donate or trash.\n\n4. Do you want the dogs? If so, you should move into the house. If not, take them to your local shelter or rescue or adoption place and explain the situation. They won't judge. \n\n4A, Either way, consider getting a pet-sitting service or a friend to look after the dogs while you figure stuff out.\n\nIf in the U.S., you should probably talk to the Social Security Administration. You may be eligible for survivor benefits. You'll want to find out if she had a pension, retirement account, or life insurance. That's all yours now.\n\nIf you can't pay her bills,  prioritize the mortgage and utilities until the housing situation is figured out. Credit card companies?

The quickest way would be to approach a local dog shelter or animal welfare, though that may not offer the best outcome for the dogs.",

It makes you feel numb while panicked at the same time and leave one very confused and clueless. \n\nNext stage is acceptance. Where you have realized what's happened and had time to process it.

You can also call different shelters or kennels and see if they have room for them.\n\nExcuse my bad English but I read she owned the home. So that means you inherit it but you have to pay the mortgage if that's what a mortgage means (someone else who's native in English can help with this) and maybe r/finance can be a good way to get help with it. \n\nThere's also r/internetparents even if we're adults ourselves we can sometimes need to feel cared for by a parental figure and that sub is great for this kind of support.

            "Consider cremation and having a small memorial service in your own. Cremation is $2400 est. Versus full casket, funeral, burial, etc. which runs $10,000 to $15,000 or more. Everything does not have to be done instantly. Don't be pressured into anything.  If you do decide to go the full casket/ funeral route, do a quick check of state law. You may be able to buy a casket direct from manufacturer versus funeral home. When my Dad died in 2008, I wanted to get a beautiful blue-silver casket online for $1200. My Mother doesn't have internet so doesn't understand.  She purchased the exact same casket at the funeral home for $3200.",
            "It\u2019s been almost a year since I lost my father under the exact same circumstances. I was also numb for days/weeks, and my mind raced each day on how to take care of everything.  \n\nThe first thing will be taking care of the remains.  Did she have insurance?  Find any paperwork you can that may be helpful (will, insurance docs, bank statements, etc.).  A funeral home can do a burial or cremation with the insurance as collateral if you don\u2019t have the money right now.\n\nUsually the funeral home will help you get the death certificate.  Where I live at least you have to go through a funeral home to get it.  The death certificate is very important in order to do any of the next steps.  If she had a bank account that listed you as beneficiary, you can get control of the account with only a death certificate.  Anything that you are beneficiary on will only require the death certificate to transfer the property to you.  If you need money to go through this process that will be invaluable. \n\nFrom there you\u2019ll need to contact an estate attorney (or any probate attorney).  Whether she had a will or not I assume you\u2019re the sole heir and will be able to get full control of her assets.  Where I\u2019m at probable attorneys will do the full process for around 2-3k.  In the end you\u2019ll receive letters of administration (or something similar) from the court.  With those you can do everything you need to in order to settle her affairs, pay any of her debts, and transfer the proceeds to yourself.  You don\u2019t need to pay her debts with your own money, but you have to pay them with hers in order to transfer the excess to yourself. \n\nIt sounds like you\u2019ll have to find another home for the dogs, unless any of this helps on that front.  I was able to I\u2019ve in my Dads home for around 6 months while taking care of his dogs and finding a way to keep them myself.  I\u2019m really sorry for your loss, feel free to message me if you\u2019d like.",
            "Hi,\n\nI'm very sorry for your loss. I'll try to be organized to help you think things through.\n\n1. If she is at a morgue many of those places will charge you fees if you leave her there  longer than a few days. Keep that in mind.\n2. If you think anyone messed up medically with her, missed a diagnosis, you can get an autopsy arranged by calling 1-800-Autopsy. Obviously this is only needed if you think medical malpractice is an issue. \n3. The least expensive way to take care of her remains is cremation. If you tell us what state you're in we can post links to cremation sites in your state and to the laws regarding cremation. Some states require embalming the body first, but many do not. \n4. If you need a casket or an urn, look online. There are several sites that sell those for far less than what a funeral home charges. \n5. If you need money for a funeral you can either wait for her life insurance payout to arrive (if she had any) or start a GoFundMe or similar fundraiser. But remember, your love was evident while she lived. **Fancy funerals are for the living, not the dead, IMO.** A simple, graveside ceremony followed by a gathering at a restaurant, church hall, or your home is perfectly OK. And if you don't want to inter her ashes in a  cemetery, if you want to sprinkle them someplace that she loved, or keep them in an urn in your home until you figure out what's best, *that's perfectly OK.* \n6. Have some music at the service, even if it's just playing from a laptop into some WiFi speakers. Music starting it, and music ending it. It helps. \n7. Ask people who knew her if they would like to speak at the funeral. That also helps. If they don't know what to say, ask if they want to do a reading of one of their favorite poems or scriptures. \n8. Dig through her stuff and find some pictures. It's always great to have those on a presentation board at the funeral as people walk in. Have some Post-It Notes and pens there too and invite people to jot down a memory and stick it to the presentation board. In a few weeks put all that in a scrapbook for yourself. \n9. Don't know how to plan a funeral? No one does until it happens. Look online for ideas. \n10. Obituaries in the newspaper are nice, but they are really expensive now. Using one of the online obits sites is fine, but not mandatory. \n\nThat is all the most important stuff for now. Plan the funeral first. All the other stuff, the cleaning out her home, **telling her creditors she has died so she cannot pay them any money, all that can wait.** **First things first.** \n\nAs some other have said already, do not let anyone bamboozle you into thinking you must pay her debts. Her debts were HERS, not yours, so they have no legal right to go after you for those.  They can try to sue her, but she will not show up in court, will she? \n\nEven the dogs can wait for a week. See if you can find a dog-sitter or friend who can walk and feed them as you handle all the First Things First stuff, then in a  week you can find a rescue shelter that can re-home them for you. \n\nI'm so sorry. Don't be ashamed to ask for more help. (BTW, I know this drill of this because I have lost multiple family members in the last decade or so. Just learned about the autopsy place a few years ago, but was too much in denial to have one done on my last relative. I'll always regret that. But I was very alone and overwhelmed in dealing with his passing. It was like no one else really cared that he died, or if they gave  damn, they did not share that information with me. Nor did they offer to help me. So, as others have said, see if any of your friends can help.)\n\n**Finally, get into grief counseling. It will help.**",

Don't touch that area. Wrap some string or ribbon or duct tape around the affected area where your mother remained. Don't return to it until it's been all cleaned up by professionals. \n\nGo thru her file cabinets and stationary supplies, for her important documents like social security card, birth certificate, mortgage or rent agreement, banking records, receipts, etc. Take it all home with you. Don't leave behind any of her idenfitiying information. \n\n1st task in the kitchen: empty the fridge and freezer. 2nd task in the kitchen: empty the pantry and remove all food items.

Same for bikes and lawn mowers and all outside stuff, things on wheels for transportation, etc. \n\nDo what you can, small tasks one at a time. Don't overburden yourself.

            "Sorry you have to go through this, it is a tough situation, especially when you have to deal with it alone.\n\nThe details will depend on where you live, but rest assured that you are not expected to deal with everything immediately. Most things will have to wait until you've received the official confirmation of death certificate from the coroner anyways.\n\nUnless someone else has access to her bank account, I would not inform the bank until you have that certificate and are legally accepted as her heir, but I cannot know about regional requirements/laws.\n\nNext time you're at her place, go through her papers and see if you can find anything like subscriptions, memberships, cell phone contracts ect. anything where she might have to pay a regular fee and inform those companies about it; they will require you to send a copy of the certificate eventually, but most will stop the payment requests which makes things easier. It can also help to print out her recent account movements, like for the past month, and check for anything that looks like something she was paying regularly.\n\nIf your mother had not planned anything herself, try to find a mortician soon. A good one will also assist you with anything that needs to be dealt with, not only the funeral, and they will know regional requirements and things that need to be thought of you might miss. If you feel like they want to push you to anything, like higher cost funeral details, or even try the guilt card with you (\"Surely your mother was worth it\" ect.): they are not a good mortician and you cannot rely on them helping you.\n\nYou are not required to pay any debts she might have had until you accepted an inheritance. Which will be dealt with by lawyers. Don't give money to anyone.\n\nInform insurances about her death (again, check her account movements for that, too), her landlord if she had rented her place. I don't know who to contact if she owned her home.\n\nAs said above, don't stress out too much, there is enough time for everything. When you find something that needs to be done, write it on a list. We also found it helpful to keep the cell  phone contract running for ca. another 3 months in case anyone tried to contact the deceased (my father in this case) and in case we needed to get access to any online accounts that would work with two-factor authentication or similar.\n\nDon't know about the dogs, sorry.

This could uncover IRAs, Life Insurance, Pensions ect. as well\n2. Cancel all credit cards and un-needed services such as cable, cell phone, subscriptions, health insurance, internet ect.\n3. IMPORTANT: In these outgoing charges, you may find life insurance your mother never knew she had. Although universal life is generally a bad idea, many older people picked some up in the 80s. Look for a State Farm, Thrivant, Edward Jones ect. charges.\n4.  If your mother was employed long term, especially by a government entity, call HR of the employer to see if any life insurance is still provided or was purchased.\n5. If your mother ever served in the military, the branch will assist with funeral costs. You will need discharge documents though. Your local Amvets may offer assistance as well.\n6. Check with any and all financial institutions your mother may have ever used. Sometimes there may be forgotten balances and/or a complimentary $1k insurance policy to use. \n7. Lastly, check your state's \"treasure hunt\" registry. This can find forgotten money owed to your mother.

But if you have any questions that come up or just want to talk about it feel free to reach out. \n\nSome of the things I had to deal with: re-homing a dog, funeral and associated decisions (such as cremation, getting death certificates, etc), getting access to and settling bills, estate sale for things I didn't want to keep, selling a house, closing bank accounts, and more.  So if you have anything you want to ask about it as time goes by, feel free.",
            "First off, I'm sorry you have to go through this alone. I hope that this forum helps you feel less alone and more supported. \n\nAs far as dogs, can you stay in her place for a while? Or find someone to pet-sit online? I can understand why someone wouldn't want to stay.\n\nIf she didn't leave any directive/will, you'll probably be overwhelmed with options. If you can find someone to aid you in the funeral-planning process, it will probably help a lot. Many morticians will take advantage of people's grief to make a sale. Do what you're capable of and know that you don't have to do everything they say. Embalming isn't a requirement, funeral services aren't a requirement. If you don't have any support, take the time you need to let your head clear... Wishing you strength. I'm really sorry.",

            "Nineteen years ago my father passed away suddenly.  I found him.  He left me and my family a dog, a busted house, bills and lots of mysteries.  I took the dog to stay with a friend temporarily.  I locked up the house and prepared for a funeral.  \n\n\nThe day of the funeral, after everything was done, me and my mother showed up at the house to begin piecing things together... and found out that people had been breaking into the house a bunch of times during the week.  It was totally ransacked.  My father had few valuables, but they were gone, including guns and a safe.  I lost important documents and who knows what... and what remained was completely scattered.  They found his spare keys and stole his truck, but we recovered it.  Keys for other vehicles were forever lost.  \n\n\nI thought this kind of shit wasn't a thing anymore... and I was dead wrong.  While its possible that his obituary tipped off the thieves, I doubt it because it was published in the area where my father was from, not where he was living.  I'm convinced one of the responders tipped off the thieves.  In this current economy, I am certain that there are drug addicts out there looking for people in this situation.  \n\n\nThe mistake I made was not staying at the house, keeping his dog there and searching the house for important stuff ahead of time.  My father's dog would have been a terrible guard dog, but barking dogs are a deterrent.  My presence would have been a deterrent.  But even if I couldn't be there or have the dog there, the number one thing I regret not doing was ransacking the house myself... taking every valuable and document ahead of time.  \n\n\nHis death was a shock and a setback for me... getting burgled made it all 10x worse.  It still bothers me what documents or effects we lost.",
            "When I was 16 I was sitting in the living room of my home on the couch playing video games. My brother, younger than me by 3 years, was in our room playing on the computer and my mom was sleeping in. It was a completely normal summer day. Or at least we thought it was. Around 1 in the afternoon my brother got hungry and remembered that our mother had leftover takeout from the previous day. He got up to ask her if he could have it. Not long after he comes running out into the living room to get me just repeating \u201cmoms not breathing\u201d in shock. I quickly got up and moved down the hall to our mothers room and walked in only to see her laying there. I could tell just by looking at her that she was dead and had been for a few hours at least. First thing I did was get my brother away with orders to call a family friend who lived nearby, he didn\u2019t need to see more of this. As he did that I walked up to my mother and confirmed the worst. No pulse, her skin had already gone cold, and rigor mortis had completely set in. \nI walked out and knowing that I was the only one there who could take charge I got moving so I wouldn\u2019t fall apart. I closed the door to her room, put the cat in my room and closed the door, and put the dogs in the backyard since I knew that once police were called they\u2019d need to be able to work. My parents were divorced at the time but we still had a good relationship with our father so I called him first to tell him what happened. I\u2019d later learn that he was packed up and on the road driving out not 30 minutes later even though he  lived a state away. Next thing I did was call the police. I was still on the phone with them when the family friend my brother called arrived. Not long after that my great uncle arrived as well having been called by my dad. \nPolice arrived not long after and the situation was out of my hands after that. Despite everything that happened I had yet to breakdown. My brother was practically catatonic in shock. It wasn\u2019t until after paramedics confirmed what I had already seen and said there was nothing they could do that I called my 70 year old maternal grandmother. I can still hear her voice breaking when I told her that her youngest daughter, her baby girl, was gone. It wasn\u2019t until I heard her that I broke.\n\nThis story happened a few years ago, I\u2019m almost 20 now, but I still remember everything that happened. When I saw this post I couldn\u2019t not comment with my story since it\u2019s so similar. My older brother who lived out of state was the executer of the estate and was the one who handled all of the paperwork so I can\u2019t give any advice on that other than to get it done pronto before government agencies get on you about it but what I can do is tell you that your not alone.",

This stuff differs a lot per country. Here in the Netherlands you really do not need a lawyer for example but that's about as much as I know for sure.   \n\nTake a breather. Cry.

            "Depending on what age she was, and if you\u2019re in the US, if she was collecting a pension or receiving social security or other entitlements you\u2019ll need to call and halt those. \n\nYou should get several death certificates because you will need them for things like cancelling bills and insurance, closing bank accounts (but only do this after you see a lawyer and you may have to probate the estate legally), etc. You may go through more than expected and they\u2019re easier to pay for at the start than wait for more. The funeral home can help here. \n\nLike others have said, don\u2019t pay her debts but know that debtors have a right to collect for anything outstanding against her property and assets (again, why a lawyer is helpful). So her property isn\u2019t just yours automatically. Yoh legally will have to give debtors an opportunity to make and receive a claim though they will be forced to wait until probate is closed. \n\nYou will also likely pay a tax on assets, including a house, that do become yours. Her estate (you or whomever is appointed executor of it) will need to file taxes on behalf of the estate as well. Get a tax specialist next year and possibly the one after that if she has a lot of things that will be transferring to you or if you\u2019re in any way uncomfortable handing this.",
            "Do not agree to be responsible for any of her debt.  You're not obligated, and some institutions will strong arm you into thinking you are.

            "Just a heads up if you've never grieved a sudden death before: for the next 2-4 weeks, you'll struggle with rational thinking. It's just not possible. So be very careful with any major decisions - sleeping on them won't work the same way it normally does. You'll get irrationally angry at people, and people will say/do the wrong thing. \n         \nTop post forgot: hire a professional cleaner for the house if needed. You'll need to contact a funeral home they can help with organisation. Make sure her friends know and they might help. Contact her friends and someone might help with the dogs.",
            "I\u2019ve seen a lot of people telling you about a death certificate. Here\u2019s how to do that: call the funeral home of your choice, let them know what happened. When the coroner finishes, they will arrange with the funeral home you choose to take her body. When that happens, meet with them. They will guide you through ordering the death certs, writing and placing an obituary, and will give you a brief checklist about what to do next. \n\nCall your county\u2019s bar association and ask for a recommendation for an estate attorney. That attorney can walk you through step by step.\n\nDid she rent or own? If she owned, call the bank that holds the mortgage. They may not be able to talk to you before the death and short certs (see next point) but you can at least explain. If she rented you should call the landlord.\n\nA short certificate is a document appointing you as the person handling the estate. Does she have a will? If not, you\u2019ll need to make an appointment at your county\u2019s register of wills/orphans court (google \u201ccounty name register of wills\u201d). If no will, they\u2019ll appoint you as administrator and give you documents supporting it.\n\nDoes your mom have any close friends who may take the dogs in? If not, try posting on her facebook or on nextdoor. Don\u2019t forget to feed the dogs. If that\u2019s a no go, contact no kill shelters in your area or call their vet and see if they have recommendations. \n\nDon\u2019t forget to eat. Call anyone you have that you\u2019re close to. Tell them you need help. Tell them to bring you food. You have to eat. \n\nCall the coroner\u2019s office and ensure the medical examiner has your number. Once you make arrangements with a funeral home, the funeral home will work with them directly and you won\u2019t have to.\n\nIf she\u2019s been there a few days you may need to hire a biohazard cleaning company. If she had homeowners insurance, they\u2019ll cover the bulk of it. If she had a mortgage, she had homeowners insurance. Her mortgage paperwork will have the name. \n\nOther than finding a funeral home, eating, and making sure the dogs eat, everything else can wait for a second. It\u2019s going to be okay. You\u2019re going to be able to do this.",
            "Don't pay one penny to anyone until you know what is going on. We learned through experiences(California) that companies will try to get money out of surviving relatives. Pay no one a dime. Be very careful about funeral expenses. Take a friend with you. \n\nI hope there was a will, so that you can avoid probate. \n\nHer debts are her debts.

            "I am so sorry for your loss. This happened to my husband about ten years ago. His mom had a bad feeling (his parents divorced when he was young) and they left the office in the middle of the day to check on him after he didn't answer the phone. Unfortunately, he had passed away. He had been sober for 20 years but fell off the wagon when his current wife left him for another man. Add to that, he had apparently started abusing prescription drugs at some point. My husband was absolutely shattered by this, to be honest. I handled a lot of the business end of things, so I will give you a bit of advice. This is a big situation to handle, but you CAN handle it. The best start is to start small. Did she have a will set up? A will can be the roadmap for how to handle quite a few things. If she doesn't have a will, don't panic. You can still handle this! You need to consult a probate/estate lawyer. Will or no will, I found that having a lawyer to consult was a godsend! \n     If you have to plan a funeral, please remember this-your loved one wouldn't want you to go into debt to celebrate their life. Don't feel guilty if you can't afford/don't want to spend the money on the 20k casket. If you find an officiant through the funeral home for a religious service, talk to them beforehand. The funeral home employees are NOT going to judge you, they see people going through loss every day. \n   Going through your mom's house is going to be hard. I found this to be the hardest part. There is going to be a lot to go through, but go room by room. Furniture can be donated/sold/kept. If you can't make a decision on an item, put it in a box labelled \"to sort later\". You can always come back to the box and make a decision later. If there are heirlooms or something important, keep them and find a way to display them. (Example, father-in-law was a musician so he had a beautiful guitar collection. I had a custom case built for \"his baby\" guitar that he had bought back in the 60s and played every day. It's on our wall and it makes us smile when we look at it now). \n   I know you can do this. It's daunting, yes, but you can get through it! Just remember, give yourself time and get a lawyer! If you cannot find a home for the dogs right away, I would suggest asking on facebook, or consider looking for rescue organizations that could possibly help you rehome them.",

I know words from strangers across the world mean little, but I hope that you know that you have love and support from us all. Your feelings are all valid and understandable. You are probably going to feel every emotion possible, and not in a linear motion. Your mind is probably going to try to understand what happened by causing intrusive thoughts to cloud over your thoughts. It is completely normal. You have just suffered one of the worst experiences that a human must endure. There is no fast, easy way to proceed. As cliche as it sounds, this pain you feel will lessen with time. You will still have mornings where you wake up and forget that your mom is dead. Then you will see a stranger who resembles her or hear a song that reminds you of her, and the profound feeling of loss will flood over you. With time, you learn to live with it. You will build up a tolerance to the pain.\n\nI suffered from a similar situation a few months ago. I had police perform a wellness check on my dad after not hearing back from him. I live out of state and had just had a baby so I couldn\u2019t go myself. I\u2019ll never forget the phone call from the officer letting me know that they found my dad dead in his apartment . My mind raced with not only loss, but questions that I will never know the answer to. When did he die? What was he doing when he died? Did he feel pain? Why didn\u2019t I try to have a wellness check performed sooner? After driving 26 hours to identify his body at the morgue, I had thoughts that \u201chey, maybe that\u2019s not really my dad that is dead in that photo\u201d. I know that there was no way that was even remotely possible, but my brain tried to rationalize it that way for some time. Then I became obsessed with trying to unlock my dad\u2019s phone to try to piece together his life before he passed. I still have his phone for the day that I am able to. \nIt sounds like you are the sole heir? If you are in the U.S., I can give you a brief rundown of what to expect regarding the legal/government side of things following the death of your parent. Each state has different laws and procedures so I would absolutely recommend looking into consulting with a probate/estate attorney. I hired one when my dad died and they were immensely helpful in navigating everything and giving me advice. \n\nFirst, do you know if your mom had a will? You can look through her belongings or an attorney can help look into it for you. If there is no will, the attorney will be really helpful. When you are going through her belongings, look for any financial documents like bank accounts, investments, real estate, life insurance, health insurance, credit cards, utilities and other bills, ect. Save them in a folder. Look for any papers with passwords or PIN numbers written on them. Do you know if she had pre-planned funeral arrangements or had certain requests? The coroner\u2019s office will hold your mom until you inform them of your arrangements. They will coordinate with the funeral home after you make arrangements. I went with a cremation for my dad because he had no family and he did not have many friends. It was around $1200, but his life insurance policy was used to cover the costs. The coroner will complete the death certificate and the funeral director will order copies for you. Get 10 copies just in case. Some companies will require you to send them the death certificate to cancel her accounts. Most allowed me to fax a copy to them. Most importantly: YOU ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY OF YOUR MOTHER\u2019S DEBTS!! As long as you are not a co-signer or listed on any accounts, you are not liable to pay to resolve any of her debts. Never agree to pay anything when you speak with them. Do not touch any of the money in her bank accounts. In my dad\u2019s case, his debts were greater than his assets so his estate was considered insolvent. When I called to cancel all his accounts, I informed them all of this and never received any other phone calls. \n\nAlso, it sounds like you have a key to your mother\u2019s house. Get all the important stuff out first and then contact the mortgage bank to inform them of her death. Some banks are shitty and will change locks and refuse to let you remove anything if you are not on the mortgage. If you go in before you officially notify them, it gives you the opportunity to get the items and documents that you need without having to worry about.\n\nSo I guess all my rambling is to let you know that being numb and then experiencing every emotion is ok. Be kind to yourself. If you need to talk, vent, or ask any questions, feel free to DM me at anytime. From one stranger to another, I am here for you and wish you eventual peace. May your mother\u2019s memory be a blessing.",

            "Alright so here\u2019s what you do: you need an estate attorney stat. Not real estate. An Estate attorney. You can find them online or contact your local courthouse to get a list. Most work on contingency as a % of the estate or flat fee after the fact. Should be no more than 5% of the estate or $500, depending on the state you live in and the cost of living in that state. \n\nChances are your mom had a will. Look through all of her legal documents and find the lawyer that wrote the will. You may be able to contact this lawyer and you can skip the first part of what I said. The point is, this needs to be done asap. Like this week type of thing. This is important: do not throw out any documents at her house! These documents will become important as you\u2019re running through her estate to see what assets she has and what debts she\u2019s got. If you can get access to her social security number, utilize that number to either go to the credit agencies or to creditkarma or to any other free credit check company. You\u2019re going to sign up an account for her using the ssn. This will help you locate any and all accounts that she has, include credit card debt, loans, mortgages, etc.\n\nAs you\u2019re doing this, you\u2019ll likely get contact by the coroner office to see what to do with the body and as well as an official death certificate. Get about 50 copies of the death certificate. It might be overkill but you\u2019ll be sending that document out to each and every account she has to gain access to everything. \n\nOnce you have the will in hand (assuming she did have a will) you\u2019ll have to figure out what to do with the remains. The will should help you understand what her wants were. Does she want to be buried? Cremated? Shot off into the sun? Find a local mortuary/funeral home and tell them what needs to happen. They will try to upsell you on stupid shit like embalming before a cremation. If she\u2019s being cremated, it\u2019s a simple matter. The biggest cost will be the urn. If you\u2019re going to be dumping the ashes somewhere (legally of course), get the most modest price urn. Technically you can do what Walter did with Donny\u2019s ashes in the big Lebowski, but there may be laws against and/or the funeral home will flat out refuse.  This expense (from cremation to the memorial etc) can be billed to the estate. \n\nOnce you get your lawyer, they\u2019ll file a document into what is called probate court. This means that you\u2019ll be legally bound as the executor of the estate. You\u2019ll handle any and all assets, pay off debts by priority from the lawyer (real estate first I believe then loans, then bills and finally credit debt, but confirm with the lawyer first). You\u2019re going to get hounded by credit card companies to pay the debt, personally. You are under no obligation to pay the debt personally. Any and all debt comes from the estate. \n\nLife insurance policies and retirement plans do not count towards the estate. They are separate with a names beneficiary. \n\nIf your mother never put you as the beneficiary or the person that she did put as the beneficiary is dead, the account will go into what is called intestate. Meaning there is no listed heir/beneficiary so it goes to next of kin (which is you). You\u2019ll have to file all of the paperwork for the insurance claims and retirement claims. This is money that you can immediately receive and cannot be touched by debtors. \n\nYour first few weeks are going to be a blur. Between the emotional hit of finding the body, having to deal with the funeral, and everything else in between, it\u2019s very easy to forget to do things. You\u2019ve got time but when you\u2019re in a clear mind, make a list of everything you need to do: contact lawyer, find the will, deal with the body and funeral home, find the accounts, go through the house for everything and catalogue what she has, then start filing paperwork. Your lawyer will be your best guidance through all of this. Lean on them to help. \n\nGood luck OP. Contact me if you need additional help, I\u2019ve been through 4 of these before, it\u2019s never easy but it does get better as you get used to it.",

(hopefully?)\n\nMy roommate and I have had this discussion before because he talks to himself *a lot*. But that's when I'm within earshot, so is it still the same as when you're truly alone? It also annoys the hell out of me when he does it, especially since it's sometimes along with a stand-up comedy routine or a sports game, and I get the sense that it's almost *performative*. Almost like how there's this wish that somebody would hear or walk by and he'd get to explain what's going on? Idk why I let it bother me.\n\nPerhaps that's not the same as what's being discussed here though. I also would *not* include singing (with or without music playing) in this same category, because that seems much more common to me.\n\nEither way, this is an interesting thread! Based on this sample size, it seems like virtually everyone is doing this.

            "I narrate the world around me. I thought about being a voice actor recently and a common piece of advice is to narrate what you're doing or read aloud the words you see. I've gotten to the point where I flip between voices for different things. If I see someone doing something sketchy, they become this poorly grammared Englishman with a deep London accent and gruffy voice. If it's a safety sign or something providing instruction, I'll use my best announcers voice like you might hear on a safety announcement or commercial. Animals get the widest and most diverse voices because they're so different. My favorite is seeing something very expensive or someone who looks like they're worth a lot, because then I do my sophisticated voice that isn't too different than the voice that Cameron uses to talk to the principal in Ferris Bueller's Day Off. \n\nThere's this game called Utter Nonsense that I always clean house playing because of this. You get a hand of cards that each have a bizarre phrase, and then someone draws an accent that everyone then has to do using a phrase from their hand of cards. So the next person in the circle chooses the accent card from a centralized deck and puts that card face up. Then everyone takes a few seconds drawing the card they think will be the funniest or best to perform. On the Amazon listing it demos the accent card as \"Pirate\", which each person's phrase card. If my card I chose was \"To be or not to be, that is the question.\" Then I would have to say that with my best or most amusing pirate voice and hope I beat out everyone else's combination of card/performance. I always do. Except 1 time someone drew \"Chicken\" as the voice and I discovered I cannot physically cluck. So disappointed in myself.",

            "Friend is from Saudi Arabia.  He told me how he lost his sister when he went to a mall with her.  Eventually he figured out who she was by looking at purses.  He said typically he'd just call her, but his phone was dead.",
            "[deleted]",
            "So i grew up in Saudi Arabia and as a kid you just get used to a certain other cues about your mom and sisters like height and gait even. On top of that not all abayas are EXACTLY same there are subtle differences that make them unique too like hems, styles of scarfs and head coverings. In fact there are certain subtle styles that can tell you which arab country the abaya clad lady belongs to. Its the same with the men, small differences in the way the white robes are lined and the colors and patterns of the headgear are designed tell you which arab country they represent. Personally identified my mom by her glasses. And my sisters, based on the the design of thier abayas. ",
            "Personal anecdote, my mom teaches abroad in Saudi and I visited her this summer. You begin to notice other things about a person (height, the way the move, voice and even the abaya they put on that morning). I almost imagine it's like losing one sense and having another heightened, just in regards to differentiating women. It doesn't hurt that in malls there are typically multiple people other than the mother for the child to possibly look out for. And it's not just women, many Saudi men wear a traditional white robe with a checkered headpiece. \n\nTldr: You pick up different aspects about a person other than looks.",
            "When i was probably 17 and started driving, i used to take my mother to malls and shopping streets all the time. \n\nA couple of times i did lose her and because of that i start looking at purses and distinct style of her Abaya. Usually she is the one to call me out since i cannot tell which is which and i am no purse expert.\n\nWith time tho, I started recognising  her Abaya style and her walking rythm and I could spot her a mile away.\n\nSauce : I am Saudi",
            "so when I was like 11 or 12 my father and I took a train to NYC. we get there and all I remember is a ton of people walking around. I thought my father was leaving so I followed a jacket and then I heard my name. looked back and he was not wearing that jacket at all. I was following around some random black dude, and we are very white.",
            "Arabian here, you learn to recognize your mom from the other women by her walk, voice, or eyes. i once got lost in 3omrah when i was 9 and was able to recognize my mom instantly from how she prayed (keep in mind there were thousands of people around). Kids can adapt much better than you think. ",
            "You'd be surprised how easily you can recognize someone just by their size, posture and gait.\n\nIn my personal experience the only time I was at risk for mistakenly misidentifying a Niqabi was when they were seated.",
            "Am Saudi. I always find my mom. Silhouette, gait, eyes, purse. Also abayas and niqabs are worn different ways and have different cuts.\n\nOne time I was a little kid in ikea, and I saw something I wanted, and I rushed to my mom and hugged her super tight and put my head on her tummy and I said please can I get that for my room. A completely different voice and accent answered with \"oh my god\" and I ran away. I still cringe about it.\n\nWearing only hijab and a colored abaya has been ok for a while. I've also been seeing girls with their hair out. The law isn't clear, but there definitely hasn't been religious police for years now, and attitudes are changing. The women I know usually say they like it, or it's in fashion, with the minority being forced. I think it'll take some time for local fashion to adapt to new freedoms.",
            "I've actually bumped into a friend several years after seeing her last, and she was now sporting an niqab. I've only ever seen her in a regular hijab (face visible), but I actually recognised her in a niqab even though all I could see were her eyes. ",
            "Look for the nanny. \n\n23 per cent of Emirati families employ more staff than they have family members. You can bet they\u2019ll be bringing at least one of them to the mall. I imagine the stats are similar in Saudi Arabia. ",
            "Saudi here. And yeah I remember once where me and my family were sitting in the corniche in Jeddah, i was probably 5 or 6 at the time and i went to throw something in the garbage can and came back to where I totally confused a woman with my mom. I was literally going to set with her until my mother called my name while she was laughing, and even the lady who I thought was my mother started laughing. So yeah it happens sometimes. ",
            "[removed]",
            "I spent a large part of my childhood in Saudi Arabia and thankfully my mom covered all but her face (when she could) so I could identify her from that.

Klein suggests the name of a medieval Dutch fisherman who developed the process.\n\n> The meaning \"cucumber preserved in pickle\" first recorded 1707, via use of the word for the salty liquid in which meat, etc. was preserved (c. 1500). Colloquial figurative sense of \"a sorry plight, a state or condition of difficulty or disorder\" is recorded by 1560s, from the time when the word still meant a sauce served on meat about to be eaten. Meaning \"troublesome boy\" is from 1788, perhaps from the notion of being \"imbued\" with roguery",

She actually too wanted to go up and pet a cow. We were walking by a field and she asked if it would be okay to climb inside the fence and go up to the cow.  I said there's no bull so I guess there's no real danger, but I told her I doubt they'd come up to her.   Unless they're human socialized they kinda leave people alone.  So she tried to approach them, but they just shied off from her.  And I was pretty bemused about the whole thing, probably like the cows were.
