            "tl;dr: There is a kind of nocturnal society that most people just aren't aware of.\n\nNight crew guy here. In a way there *is* a nocturnal society: Truck drivers, warehouse people, people overnight in grocery stores that keep the shelves stocked, cops, ambulance crews, doctors and nurses, people who do road construction, people that keep power plants running, linemen that keep the power going when lines get taken out, clerks at stores, security guards...I've got to be missing at least a million.\n\nSo, so much goes on at night that most people wouldn't think or be aware of. The world doesn't stop at night. IMHO most of the important things that keep society running are handled by people like me who are \"invisible\". And I don't mean invisible in a derogatory way. Its just that people don't realize that we're there. They shouldn't! If people really have an occasion to think about us it means that somebody messed up somewhere along the way.",

            "This is a concept that gets explored in [Rant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rant_(novel)). What happens is that the night shift half of society starts becoming the underclass for a variety of reasons and it snowballs. Everything pretty much starts from the problem that most people would prefer not to be nocturnal.\n\nI\u2019m not saying this is book is a study of what would necessarily happen but it\u2019s an interesting take.",

            "People keep talking about night shift stuff and the places they frequent,  but I don't think that's what you're asking at all. Eating at the gas station or Denny's for the fiftieth time in a row is nothing like having school, hobby stuff, shopping, parks, and other common life stuff throughout the whole night.\n\nThe reasons for not maintaining that are mostly pragmatic. Lighting has been costly throughout history whether it's firewood, candles, gas, or electricity. Human health doesn't work as well on a night schedule. Vitamin D from direct sun exposure. Circadian rhythm performed by the pineal gland using melatonin. That recently discovered thing where viewing large amounts of greenery helps depression.  There are many small health things that add up to suggest humans work best when exposed to daylight hours and sleeping in dark hours.\n\nDarkness is also potentially dangerous. Driving is a bit more dangerous. General awareness can be tougher. Small things like an increased risk of tripping can really add up if you apply it to the vast majority of the population. \n\nFamilies are also a consideration. Especially families with children. It can be very difficult to parent a kid with a sleep schedule that is wildly different from the kid's. But school is the center of childhood and having two school shifts would be very costly to the school district. Especially in places with smaller populations.",
            "When o worked on outsourcing,  we worked with a company that operated 8 hour shifts with each desk being shared by 3 people, as 1 person got out of thier seat, another person sat into it.\nIt ensured people never worked longer than paid and that production went 24 hrs.\nWas only 5 days a week so system maintenance happened at weekend. Worked great for us, but logistics for company to manage transport, food, etc meant only large companies could achieve it",
            "Everybody here missing the point big time, what you're asking, OP, is something like [B-society](https://www.b-society.org/chronobiology/).\n\nI've particularly given this topic quite a bit of thought because I'm a night owl and would love to not feel trapped at my own house when I feel most active. \n\nThe biggest trouble implementing something like that is how do you merge a society that sleeps at different times? Specially when it comes to noise in residential areas, imagine a B person wants to have a BBQ party at their house at their preferred time but the A people need to be at work in less than 4 hours and the music and loudness is really fucking up their sleep. And the other way around is also true, if an A person has a party at a normal time they'd be fucking up B people sleep.\n\nThis is just one example but what I'm trying to get at is that with people being active comes noise, from traffic to people simply talking and working, basically there would never be a specific time of the day where people can expect silence and peacefully sleep which would fuck up quality of life for everybody.\n\nPlus this would be a monumental change in society, and monumental changes like that don't simply happen.",

The only people on the street were sweepers, trash collectors etc.\n\nSo basically, it was a nocturnal society. The mix of old tourist following a normal schedule, young tourists following an inverted schedule, and citizens following all kinds of schedules, there always was someone on the streets. I saw literal toddlers at 1 am there.",

I can say this, in my small town in Ohio, there is always one 24-hour store. Circle K. And the only time they are not busy is somewhere between 2-4 a.m. Given that the one and only 24 hour shop in a town of 15,000 is always busy, I actually think there is a much larger population of people that are night owls than most realize.

            "Other answers are leaving out 2 important factors: normalisation and an asymmetrical playing field.        \n\nNormalisation is strong in human society. I guess it conferred an evolutionary advantage to bands of hunter-gatherers if they all followed the same rules.  We've inherited that in the form of pushing people into standardised boxes (hetero like me, same religion as me, same politics as me, *it's 3 minutes after 9 why aren't you at your desk?*).\n\nThen there's the uneven playing field.  Woody Allen once said we have nothing to fear from aliens who are 1000's of years more advanced than us, because we wouldn't be interesting to them.  It's the aliens who are 20 minutes ahead of us we have to fear. They'll get the parking spots, the best seats at restaurants....     \n\nSo it goes with early risers. They arrive first and declare themselves more reliable.  They compare themselves to night owls at an hour which favours themselves and they don't just declare *themselves* more productive but they declare *that time of day* more productive.     \n\nAnd *that's* the thing which gets fed into the normalisation process.      \n\nMaybe one day placing value on the night owls will be the thing which gets normalised.",

            "I went to university in a city with a small \"normal\" population, two large universities and two colleges. The population of this city was *overwhelmingly* made up of students and fresh graduates. These are the exact kinds of people who are most likely to stay up late at night - not just because their schedules often allow it, but also because many of them need to cram for a test (or want to party). A situation like that is one in which you would have an extremely high percentage of the population up late, and thus is most likely of any place in the world to support 24-hour shops and things. But there were two malls smack between the universities, both within walking distance of both campuses, both with clubs and restaurants and pizza joints and the kinds of places that you'd think would be most eager to cater to the night-owl student population... and of the 40+ different retailers in those two malls, there were maybe 5 or 6 that stayed open to weird hours. Only one was legitimately 24 hour (a convenience store) - the others were just open until around 2 or 3am. And they were largely empty during the late night. There was a small rush at the restaurants (pizza place, gyro place, all-day breakfast diner, and a ramen bar) when a nearby bar closed, which is probably why they stayed open that late, but they all closed about an hour after that. That was it. Even in a university town, even in the most ideal context for trying to create the situation you're talking about... most places still closed, because not enough people were awake to justify keeping most of the shops open past 10, and most of the restaurants around midnight.\n\nAdd to that the fact that a lot of employers aren't going to want their employees working weird late hours anyway. Even if I *wanted* to work from 6pm to 2am, I wouldn't be able to. I work as a programmer, where being able to talk to my coworkers is important. My team has 5 people. They're not going to split us into two teams. They're *definitely* not going to split us into three teams (which would be necessary to cover the full 24 hour set). And sure, yeah, you might wanna know what this has to do with anything - I'm a programmer, so my office doesn't need to be open 24 hours, right? Only the shop down the street does in order to create the kind of world you're talking about. Except because I keep normal 9-5 hours because that's how my office operates, and because the vast majority of my neighbours do the same, for the same reasons, it doesn't matter if most of us are secretly night owls because we still have to keep normal hours regardless and will not shop at the store at 4am. So the store isn't gonna see any reason to pay to be open at 4am.\n\nYou need a city big enough to have enough night owls and night-shift workers to justify keeping a few places open. And in those cities (or in places where night shifts are unusually common), you get exactly that. But it's only ever a fairly limited number of stores that stay open to these weird hours - you'll never end up in a situation where every shop is open all the time. It's not economically feasible.",

Now think of a small local store/shop: if they keep tighter hours (like 11AM-5PM, instead of 7AM-9PM), that's because they are trying to balance the average amount of revenue they get hourly, with the expenses to keep it open those hours (like paying employee's), along with keeping it open when it's busiest. That's why a lot of stores aren't open from 5AM-11PM - disadvantageous expensenditures.

            "For most things that have to turn a profit, the night is rarely ever profitable.\n\nWorkers still need to be paid, electricity is consumed and operation costs are ongoing even in the night. However, most of your customers are asleep. So you end up paying to operate during a time when nobody is coming in to buy anything.\n\nFor things that don't turn a profit, there is still a pseudo-profit being analyzed. You can look at it as a ratio of sorts, Dollars spent vs. Utility received. A 24/7 Library would have rather exorbitant costs, but offer very little real benefit when analyzed through that lens. If you are tasked with trying to spend Taxpayer dollars for maximum impact and utility, you still find operating things through the night isn't efficient. \n\nThis isn't a universal truth, though. In many denser urban and suburban areas, you will find some facilities are 24/7. This is usually because it has been found that there is at least a *marginal* benefit to doing so. At the very least, those in charge have found that the 24/7 schedule at least breaks even during night hours, and the added convenience can improve daytime business. One example of this is Walmart. If you know Walmart is *always* open, what might be your first choice in a pinch when you need something real quick? \n\nIn theory, I love the idea you bring up OP. I wish our society was like that.

It is common place for the packaging to break open on these items and the contents roll all around.

And second, we wash our cutlery and dishes and bowls and cups with soap, and is that like taking a mouthful of soap? No, because you have...get this...rinsed it afterward. That said, there are also organic washes specifically meant for fruits and vegetables. I use those when I have them, and for the soap squeamish, they are a good alternative.\n\nAnything that has been handled by the unwashed masses gets washed with dish soap or produce spray by me. Lots of germs gone, no residue remaining. Yum. And that's fine, you can call me a germaphobe, I don't mind. My fruit doesn't have fecal matter and dick germs all over it.",

So if you always leave at exactly 5:00, it indicates that you are working to the clock rather than to the task, which is not what salaried work is supposed to be.",
            "You say you're salaried.  My parents in their careers were salaried, and in their jobs, that meant that they're paid to get the job done, regardless of how long it takes.  If they finished early, fine.  If they didn't finish in a normal 8 hour work day, they were expected to be there nights and weekends to get things done.\n\nA lot of times jobs put people on salary because they know the job is more than 40 hours a week and they don't want to pay overtime.  Perhaps your job is like that and all of your coworkers know that, so they think it's weird that you're leaving.  In some professions you'll be fired if you're not staying overtime when you need to.  I don't know what kind of job you signed up for, but are you in one of those professions?\n\nMost of the time, salaried means you don't have a \"shift\".  Are you used to shift work?  Salaried can mean you work when and how hard you need to, without regards to a set \"shift\".\n\nI'm not saying it's great.  I'm saying that's how it is.  How you handle is up to you.  Are you getting all your work done?",
            "You are applying an hourly schedule to a position that does not have hours.  It doesn't mean you have to sacrifice your life but it does mean you better be getting everything done.  You can be both a successful professional and a happy person.  Sometimes it will mean leaving early with no ramifications.  Other times it means staying late.  You admit it's your first job in an office setting.  I think you are viewing it based on hours worked rather than work product produced.",
            "I agree that people in the US work too much, and you should leave at 5 if you're done for the day, but being salaried often (usually?) means you don't have a set 'shift.'  So that you're working very rigid hours is kind of weird, especially the not starting until 8 on the dot even if you're there early. Obviously I don't know what your job is, so perhaps the coverage 8-12 & 1-5 is strictly required, but for the other people in your office it may not be, so they're working more flexibly or just need to get certain tasks done before they call it a day. Or they arrive later and thus work later - I'm not a morning person, so I tend to start my day at 9 unless I have an earlier meeting, so I tend to work until 6.\n\nAs long as you're accomplishing what you need to get done each day/week, that shouldn't be an issue, but it could still be out of step with your workplace culture which could hurt you long term (depending on your role, what yardstick is used for meeting vs exceeding expectations, and your goals).  \n\nIt would probably be a good thing to talk to your manager about or another coworker (perhaps someone who's more of a peer) though, just to make sure you're not majorly missing expectations. (And if those expectations are to stay late for no good reason, then you'll know that this isn't the best job for you long term and can start planning your escape)",
            "That's an American thing. Gotta be a slave to your company, never take a vacation and show up sick. Most are afraid if they don't do extra for free they may get fired.",
            "You will find that most people who are persistently work overtime have very poor time management skills that they won't admit to.  If you can't get your job done in the specified hours, then this is your problem you need to work on.\n\nIn past I have been asked why I never stay behind myself & my simple answer is \"what would you like me to do in that extra time - sit there & twiddle my thumbs?\".  If you are working efficiently, then you should have spare time during work hours.",
            "Some people think that their time is gonna be rewarded, maybe your coworkers have been there long enough to know that they will be, but if you\u2019re salaried and you know that it isn\u2019t rewarded, never ever work overtime.",
            ">\tI\u2019m in the US if that makes any difference\n\nIt does.",
            "you sure its them giving you weird looks, or you just looking for weird looks",
            "If you leave right on the dot at a salary job people will judge you. Notice you\u2019re the first one leaving.\n\nNow you can decide how you want to value or interpret that judgement. But you are correct, your coworkers are judging you.",
            "I guess it kinda depends on the workplace and the employees' culture.\n\nIn my previous place, the majority of the employees are young adults and female (not sure if this is relevant, but mentioning it just in case), and it was exactly like you described. In my current place, the gender split is more 50:50 and the majority are 30's-40's people with some middle-aged ones, and almost everyone that's not the cleaning staff actually clocks out 5-10 minutes before the bell rings, and the bosses are cool with it.",
            "What is your job?\n\nObviously if you're a surgeon it's frowned upon to just bounce in the middle of a surgical procedure",
            "If you get paid to work. Work. If you don't. Don't.\n\nIf you get paid to work and don't do anything at work... well good luck\n\nIf you dont get paid to work and still work... hope you have a good reason. Saying \"everyone else does it\" is NOT A REASON.",

            "Youve never worked a DOD job.   At 5:00:12 that place was a ghost town.  No body stays late there.",
            "I don\u2019t understand why you have to wait until 8 to start. If you\u2019re salaried and you show up early, why can\u2019t you start early and then leave early if you finish your work for the day?",
            "At my old job people would stay 30 mins to an hour later\u2026 the job didn\u2019t pay us past 3.\nI didn\u2019t get it.",
            "My manager pulled me into his office about this once and after a bit of a conversation basically admitted that it\u2019s more about perspective than performance so then I pretended to be more engaged at work and now he thinks I\u2019m real good at my job when I\u2019ve changed literally nothing. Business is dumb",
            "Ive seen really good people quit and be very blunt about workplace schedules.  Lead team would routinely schedule meetings that started 10 min before the end of the day and new managers would ask why or just leave cause they have kids and responsibilities.  Its so messed that they want you to put work before family.",
            "They shouldn't but they do. Some people are just clock watchers, if you end up with a manager that expects you to start working as soon as you're shift starts and stay a bit longer than your paid time then they don't care about your wellbeing and it's time to switch manager or job.",
            "Reddit is very anti-work so I'm going to throw a different opinion in the mix. \n\nIf I was working on an email and the clock struck 5, I'd probably spend an extra 5 minutes finishing that email if it means I don't have to deal with it tomorrow. I get the viewpoint of give an inch and they'll take a mile, but in context I think it makes sense to just stick around an extra 5 minutes if it's relevant.",
            "Nothing wrong with leaving on time to me, but if they did say something to you I would leave out the part that you have a long commute to consider, bc that's not there problem.",
            "Whether this is okay or not kind of depends on you and your boss.\n\nFirstly you are salaried so I'm guessing its not really how many hours you work that matters to your company but if your projects are completed or parameters are met within a deadline.  Salaried doesn't mean I work 40 hours a week and get $X.  It mean you can work 32 hours or 72 hours and still get $X.  Teachers are salaried and thus have to do stuff like grade papers after hours.  Or my brother in IT work is on call for network failures at hospitals.  Or if you managed a store you would be expected to show up if an employee called off on your day off.  \n\nSo at the end of the day it isn't your hours, it's the job expectations.  If you are leaving early and slowly falling behind you probably won't last long.  And if you are new and everyone else is staying over you need to ask yourself if you think you are just more efficient than everyone or if you are leaving part of your job undone.",
            "If you arrive 10 minutes early, why are you waiting until 8 on the dot to start working. That is weird behaviour. \nDo you also start your lunchbreak at the specific time and won't work until bang on 1 hour later?",
            ">I\u2019m in the US if that makes any difference. \n\nIt does. We suck when it comes to this.",
            "This mentality is so prevalent in the car sales industry that you will literally get shit from management or coworkers for leaving on time when you don\u2019t have a customer or an appointment for later in the day. Popular joke is to call you a \u201cpart timer\u201d despite the 12-14 the work days, like Jesus, I am a dad of a small child and I\u2019d like to see my family for more than 30 mins in the morning before work",
            "I had a boss that made you feel weird about leaving. I had a coworker that would just leave when his shift was over. She never even bothered making comments to him. He established a boundary and stuck to it.\n\nMy advise is if the employer isn't making clear statements that you should stay, then just leave if you want to.\n\nI would advise you to ignore any part of toxic office culture you don't like and focus on being productive."

Videos and gifs would stop playing in the preview as the frontpage auto refreshed every other minute. The worst part is that I wasn't finding anyone who had a similar problem on google, anywhere.  Today I decided to go deep to resolve this. Spent whole half an hour to get rid of this 'feature' which seemed that 1) didn't bother anyone but me, 2) I was the only one who got an auto refresh reddit.\n\nand then, after years, I remember that I installed a 'Reddit Auto Refresh' addon\n\nI was probably baked when I installed this.

            "So true! When my daughter was murdered the media tried to focus on her killer but i went and talked to the news stations in my area and asked them if they had to talk about it to make the story more focused on her and how she lived not the rest. Thankfully the majority listened but there was one who didn't and it still makes me so upset. Christmas eve this news stations aired ta story about everything with a big picture of him. Its hard grieving then being surprised by his face.\n\nThe more the public contacts news stations and expresses they don't want stories to be focused on or glamourizing killers the higher of a chance they will stop. We are their ratings we decide what they show by watching what they show or changing the channel.",

            "Aside from media sensation, the police will use nicknames because it identifies what that person's method of operation is.  For example, if the police called someone Cowardly Dipshit, that would describe every criminal in America.  However, if they call someone BTK (bind, torture, kill) then they have idea of what the person did and can tie multiple crimes together.  A name like the Green River Killer is way to track the geographical habits of the killer. The police use these operational names, but often the media gets wind of them and then glamorizes them.",

All of the examples, Zodiac, The Night Stalker, Jack the Ripper, are decades old. Trashy tabloid media in the 70s and 80s (or 1880s) did this and popularized these villains but I honestly can't think of a recent case with a notoriety boosting nickname.\n\nThere was a serial killer in Toronto that was arrested a few years ago. Bruce McArthur, but I had to look him up just now because his story wasn't sensationalized.\n\nRobert Pickton killed dozens of women in the Vancouver area earlier this century, no scary nickname that I know of. \n\nA lot of high profile killers in recent years are spree killers that seem more tied to where they attacked than a nickname. Virginia Tech. El Paso Wal Mart. Las Vegas Country Music Festival. \n\nI agree this did happen for years and was problematic but acting like it's an ongoing issue seems off base. I'm Canadian and see Canadian news a lot, hence my examples, so maybe this is happening and I don't see it but my experience is this being a problem of the past.",

            "\"It's the media\" is an umbrella term I wish people wouldn't default to for everything. Serial killers are named either by specifically \\*tabloid\\* media (meaning the shocking/sensational stories and twists up front, from unreliable sources, as opposed to your local news channel, who have to make a choice to go with that or another term) or an amalgam of the location and kind of killings, like how police or the FBI would describe them in the office. The names appear to originate from a handful of sources, not just \"the media\", which really could mean a large variety of things.  \nTo give them silly names would be to undermine the severity of the crimes, as tempting as it is to call an asshole an asshole. It also lets regular assholes off the hook a bit, which ain't so good, either. I get what you're saying, though.",

            "Because the reddit media servers are cancer af. This applies to all i.redd.it and v.redd.it posts. On some days you can watch the media just fine, then one minute later the servers bug out and you sit there trying to load a 5MB video with your 1GBit connection for an hour.\n\nI always tell users not to use the reddit built-in hosting and instead use gfycat or imgur but I doubt my comments have much impact if any at all.\n\nAs a bonus: v.redd.it saves your videos into separate files, the audio is one file and then the videos without the audio gets multiple files for different qualities. What this means is via reddit and without any 3rd party software you'll not be able to download any video including the sound from v.redd.it and because of this bots like /u/vredditdownloader exist.\n\nAs a second bonus: reddits media posting is so horribly flawed that users create multiple submit with the same exact image, that image then gets saved with a new filename every time ultimately creating multiple copies of just one image. For a *messageboard-socialmedia-mashup*-website this is horrible, even 4chan has a duplicate image detection and a pretty good one I might add.\n\nAs a third bonus: the reddit built-in media hosting is probably karmawhores most important feature because of no duplicate checks as I've mentioned before. So karmawhores post one video, a day later they post the same video under a new filename, a day later... you get the idea and if you check those posts carefully, most of the posters NEVER link to the original source but some reddit users, me included, then find out the actual source of a clip and post it in the comments. Quite often the OC is from a YT clip that you could just share with your friends with zero problems but when you want to share a v.redd.it post with your friends, reddit becomes so goddamn awful trying to force it's shitty app onto users and if you don't use the app when browsing with your phone, you'll never be able to see all the content (including comments) of the post.\n\nSidenote: I absolutely hate what reddit is being turned into. I first got here because it was lightweight and a good place to discuss but then it gained more popularity and this, like with any other thing that becomes popular, dragged in more karmawhores. reddit also started to be \"more appealing\" to the userbase by implementing a shitty new design and forces that design onto everyone who doesn't care enough to find a post where it shows you that can put \"old.\" as subdomain to not get the freaking new design. The new design is impractical and inefficient, it's like one day you're using MIRC to discuss things with people and suddenly on the next day you try to open up MIRC but Skype launches, like wtf. Oh and before I forget, can anyone give me a good reason why there is a fucking chat functionality?

            "Reddit is very badly optimized. Having this site open often brings my computer to its knees, and its a powerful computer. the app also destroys my phone battery.  \nafter a few minutes scrolling through the feed it turns into a slideshow.",
            "Software and systems engineer here.\n\nIt's a combination of things.\n\n- YouTube's video player is hand-coded and they have very competent engineers working on it. Reddit uses a much clumbsier video editor that doesn't handle videos very well at all.\n- YouTube has a large \"content distribution network\" (CDN) that copies videos to servers that are geographically closer to you. Contrary to what many believe, the internet is NOT fast (relatively speaking) and even though your connection speed might be fast, traveling far distances still adheres to the laws of physics. A server that is closer to you means a shorter distance a signal has to travel.\n- YouTube servers have very, very high throughput and better internet connections. This one is arguable since Reddit is very likely using similar or the same datacenters as Google (it's hard to tell without being an employee), but it's important to remember that the speed of data between you and another server on the internet is only as fast as the slowest \"hop\" between you (a hop is a single direct connection between two servers or routers for example)\n- YouTube has dynamic buffering, meaning based on your connection speed, YouTube can fetch larger or shorter portions of video based on memory usage and connection stability, as well as switch video quality on the fly (lower quality = less data to send = faster transmission of pieces of video).\n- YouTube can make better optimization tradeoffs due to the nature of videos. YouTube videos tend to be long - several minutes or more - whereas Reddit videos are much shorter (on average). When a YouTube video is uploaded, they process the video using expensive and lengthy compression passes that favor longer runs of video data before the video is ever made public for viewing. Such optimization passes don't work as well for short videos AND are computationally expensive - I would imagine Reddit has much less interest in spending the money than YouTube does since reddit is not (primarily) a video hosting site.\n\nUnless a Google or Reddit employee can say definitively, keep in mind most of the answers here will be speculative unless the clients are reverse engineered and profiled properly - something I'm sure not many people (if any) on this thread have done.",

            "Not seen anyone write here about how ISPs and backbone providers also can \u201creserve\u201d bandwidth for certain sites as well as have cached stores of it locally to act as a buffer  and provide a better service to the typical end user.\nUsers on YouTube, Netflix, Facebook etc\n\nunfortunately that means other smaller sites can\u2019t compete as they can\u2019t afford to get dedicated bandwidth or cached content hosted on ISPs.\n\nCached content reduces the load on the backend servers as they only need to refresh cached data stored on the ISP instead of X amount of clients\n\nISPs will periodically send requests/hashes to check content is still valid else will update itself \n\nThis is all transparent to the end user\n\nI\u2019m no expert but I know this is done to some degree on all sorts of platforms even in companies utilising loadbalancing for internal web intranet.",

They would occasionally glance back at us and I know they heard our accents.

            "England here. As others have said, we're kind of normalised to it thanks to TV, movies, etc. But it always sounds a little strange in real life. Now and then you hear an American in England and (not to be rude) they almost always seem to be the loudest voice in the room. Not like they're shouting or being obnoxious or anything, their voices just seem louder. One time I was sitting in a hotel lobby in Wales and this American guy walked in. The sheer bass of his voice was astounding.\n\nHonestly though (and this is a bit off-topic), more shocking than the accent is just the manner of speech and general behaviour. I never get this impression from the way people talk online, but it seems like in North America (I've been to Florida and to Canada) people are always super nice to each other, especially to bus drivers, cashiers, etc. They always have such complete and wholesome goodbyes. \"Thank you very much! You have a great day, God bless\", etc. By comparison it feels like we over here are all just depressed and want minimal human contact. \"thx\"",

There is a lot of slang and some accents from the southern states. Nothing too fancy imo.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Edit: It's obviously a bad idea to generalize anything and that is also true for accents. I didn't put a lot of effort into writing down what I wanted to say in my comment, so let me fix that:*  \n*There must be a variety of accents in the USA. Many might not be as distinguishable as british, scottisch or australian though. But with such a large country and especially landfolks living in the same places for centuries and not travelling and moving a lot, there must be differences. I'm from Germany and have lived in TX for 2 years, so I'm rather used to southern accents and I do see the movie actors way of talking as \"the\" american way to talk, which is obviously wrong if you give it enough thought. But the common movie talk is pretty plain, maybe actors even work on losing accents to fit general roles properly. Not too many (Sir) Sean Connerys around these days. That's what lead me to say american english sounds rather plain, compared to other countries english, but obviously there is a lot of variety in the american accents, just as there is a lot of variety in the american culture anyways. Californias movie production just kind of dictates what is generally viewed as american accents.*",
