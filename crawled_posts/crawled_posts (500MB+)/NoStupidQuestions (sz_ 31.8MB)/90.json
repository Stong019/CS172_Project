The pin is still inside and there's no hole in the bottom (it would have the bottom drilled out if the gunpowder or whatever was taken out). I've considered pulling the pin and chucking it in the woods or in the creek out in his backyard but the age of the device makes me afraid that it might misfire or something and go off in my hand and I kinda still need that. I thought about calling the authorities but it would be really embarrassing if they came to get it with a whole team and everything and it turned out to be a dud. I honestly have no clue what to do about and I'm just hoping reddit can help. Thanks.",

            "If it goes off in your hand, then losing your hand is the least of your worries. A grenade going off that close has a strong chance of flat out killing you. It could be a dud, or you could die. Even if it works perfectly, you could throw it wrong and die. It's much too risky to mess around with it yourself. Call the police. They can get experts who know what they're doing.",
            ">throwing a grenade \n\nI mean, there's a reason everyone's veteran pop-pop can barely hear shit, has ringing, and they've got shrapnel all over em.",
            ">I've considered pulling the pin and chucking it in the woods or in the creek out in his backyard\n\nDon't.\n\nIn fact, don't even move it. If you haven't touched or moved it yet, don't. Some kinds of explosives become unstable over time and can be set off by vibrations. (In Germany and France they occasionally have old shells, buried in the ground, spontaneously going off.)\n\nEven if this were a brand new grenade in perfect working order, you should not goof around with it on your own. High explosives make a very loud noise and can damage your hearing; and if it's a fragmentation grenade, you might be surprised how far it can spread dangerous shrapnel.\n\n>and go off in my hand and I kinda still need that.\n\nIf it goes off in your hand, you'll be missing a lot more than just your hand.\n\n>I thought about calling the authorities but it would be really embarrassing if they came to get it with a whole team and everything and it turned out to be a dud.\n\nCall them anyway. They'd rather find a dud grenade than have to scrape bits of you off the walls of your living room.\n\nBe careful what you tell them. Don't say 'Hi police, I have a grenade!', because then you'll sound like you're calling in a bomb threat. Say something like: 'I was going through some of my grandfather's stuff and found an object that may be a live explosive, I'd like a professional to handle it. It's at [address]. I'll meet you outside.' They'll tell you the usual stuff about not touching it and evacuating any other people from the area.",

They said that they had found some explosives and were going to detonate them in the park opposite my house, and that I should stay inside my house.

            "Here\u2019s a good story: when I was in middle school or maybe freshman year, I told my friends about a grenade that my dad had. He always told me it was real and from his dad/the war, and he kept it super high up hidden away and all that. Once I told my friends about it, it was like an obsession, they constantly wanted to see it and we were all fascinated by it. Eventually I relented and I showed them where it was one day when my parents were at work. We were circled around it all arguing about if it was real or not. My one friend was strangely silent and just intently staring at it the whole time. My parents lived on a 10 acre property in the desert so there weren\u2019t many neighbors or anything. Suddenly, the silent friend says \u201cfuck it,\u201d and he grabs the grenade, pulls the pin, and just chucks it into the sagebrush. For a split second, we all shit our pants, we were like running and diving behind shit and hiding, screaming and yelling. Adrenaline pumping we are all covering our ears just waiting. And waiting. And waiting. After what seemed like ages we slowly came out of our hiding spots like \u201cwtf?\u201d And that\u2019s how I found out my dad was a master troll",

I did. An officer came out. Duck walking. Holding a mailing envelope in her out stretched arms. Asked if I was the one with the explosives. I said I was. I took the firecracker out of my shirt pocket and showed her. She instructed me to carefully place it in the envelope. One of those with air bubbles inside. Explosive rated I guess. She said either I was the most highly trained person she ever met, or the dumbest. I was playing with these when I was 8-10 years old. I have had training with explosives.

Short-ish story is that this house has changed hands 5 times in 30 years and the garage\u2019s \u201cwood corner\u201d (lots of 2x4s, plywood, wire, etc) was probably never fully emptied. Some previous owner was a collector or foraged a nearby (historic) arty range and stashed it in the corner; successive wood placed there obscured it. To clarify, there is absolutely no way to identify it as safe so this person is alive because of dumb luck.\n\nA year into owning the house, I finally used enough wood to reveal it but assumed it was a rusted bottle jack for another couple months until I got close enough to ID it as a 75mm artillery shell (just the \u201cwarhead,\u201d not the casing). I know it was fired because the brass band was grooved, meaning it had engaged barrel rifling. The timing \u201ccap\u201d was pristine, though, which suggests it had been replaced for a collection piece.\n\nCalled the cops; they came just to confirm it was worthy of the bomb squad\u2019s attention, and the tech eventually arrived to x-ray it. Caused a big stir in the neighborhood but all participants thought it was cool. By the end, we had like 8 cop cars here and a handful or neighbors because it was the only exciting thing going on in a relatively small town.\n\nThe tech confirmed it was safe (he said it was solid metal) but didn\u2019t offer it back; I didn\u2019t ask for it.

We do not know you, we want to refer to you, we don't know your name, so bam, the first exotic  thing about you. \n\nLike, when a french guy sees an asian guy, and he wants to contact him, for example, to warn him about something, it seems perfectly acceptable to pick the most obvious thing to catch your attention (he's looking mighty asian), specify it (china), go for the french term (chinois) and go, \"Eh, chinois! \", with the same gusto that an american would go, \"eyyyy, detroit\".",

            "I can't speak for Nevada, but Arizona has plentiful natural resources. Or we did when people settled here, at least. Some of these resources are on our state seal: copper, cattle, citrus, cotton, and climate. The \"five C's\" of Arizona, as they're called. \n\nMost cities were originally farming or mining towns; there are many (many!) farms and mines still active all over the state. AZ has (or had) gold, silver, copper, quartz, salt, granite, lead, gravel, coal, even uranium. People love our dirt, too! We have really good dirt, lol.\n\nAlso, Arizona is a *huge* state - we literally have six different biomes! The top part of the state is not desert, but forest, and there's skiing in the winter. You should come check us out sometime, there's lots to do and to see. Just don't visit in the summer!",
            "Contrary to your line of questioning, Phoenix exists because of its resources. The natives here lived along the Salt, and Gila rivers. Which, at the time were un-dammed and perennial flowing rivers. After they left, and the western settlers came, they found a system of canals that had been built by the natives and utilized them for their own agricultural needs. The land was/is fertile here and good for farming. The Phoenix basin has always been habitable and great for farming and mining of certain minerals at the time, but the settlement got larger and eventually grew into the unsustainably monstrous metropolitan area we have now. \n\nAs for the rest of Arizona, the state is very rugged for sure, however there is no shortage of resources vital to modern life. Copper, silver, gold, uranium, lead, and zinc are plenty here and mining of these materials is still huge business here. \n\nSure AZ is damn hot. But it is far from uninhabitable/useless. \n\nAs for Vegas: It shouldn't exist. Thank Bugsy Siegel and his criminal empire for that little monument to man's arrogance.\n\nEdit: I feel I have been unclear about the natives mentioned here. A couple comments have come up basically questioning my phrasing that they \"left.\" Some kinda scoffed and some said they were forced onto reservations. The natives im referring to were the Hohokam people. They inhabited the salt river basin for centuries and did indeed leave sometime in the 1300's, well before any of the events of the western expansion. Those people were not forced onto reservations and I am not trying to whitewash their story in any way. It is unclear why they disappeared and abandoned their settlememts. But as I mentioned in another comment, there are claims to Hohokam lineage by the modern O'odham people.  I hope I cleared things up a bit. If I'm off, please correct me.",
            "A lot of those desert cities used to have a lot more water than they currently do. Tucson was founded on a river, which is now dry (there have been efforts to revitalize sections of it). When the cities were founded, it wasn't as hot as it is now, and even now, it's only really bad for about 3 or 4 months out of the year, which a lot of people see as a reasonable tradeoff (like the cold months in the north). The lack of humidity also feels good for people with certain health conditions like arthritis.\n\nThere are natural resources. Copper mining was a huge industry in Arizona for many years. The conditions of the area also make it valuable for the optics industry (telescopes), for military operations, and for long-term airplane & other vehicle storage (lack of corrosive elements, stable ground).",

You can cool a building by \\~5 BTUs using just 1 BTU of energy. You need to use 1 unit of energy to heat a building by 1 unit of energy. And that's just for AC, you can do even better using a swamp cooler, which can only be used in dry climates.   \n\n\nAs for the money to transport food, the majority of food that is imported from Mexico arrives via truck through the port of Nogales in southern Arizona and passes right through Tucson. It is cheaper to transport it there than anywhere else in the US. If you go to the grocery store there, you will see cheaper prices than where you live, I almost guarantee it.",
            "In Nevada, most of the towns and city were first formed because of steam railroads. Back in the day, a steam train could only go so far without getting water to make steam.  Any place that had a spring, river or easy well would form a town. As cars took off they built highways next to the rails and over time ripped out most of the rails. Now most of the places in Nevada either support mines nearby or are dying. \n\nFun Fact: Las Vegas means The Meadows in Spanish and there used to be a spring just off the strip until it was pumped to much.",

            "Both Arizona and California have abundant natural resources. And California has plentiful water supplies (they also use a lot of water as the number 1 producer of agriculture in the US). \n\nArizona: copper (1st in the US), Gold, silver, lead, gravel stone, clay, pumice, coal, petroleum, uranium, salt, livestock, cotton, melons, winter lettuce, dates, wheat, citrus fruits\n\nCalifornia: water (enough to irrigate  8,000,000 acres of land as well as sustaining its cities). California produces more food than any other state. And that land is irrigated with California water. Seafood (number 2 in the us), timber and wood products (number 2 in the us), silver, manganese, copper, tungsten, uranium (ca produces 10% of US total minerals), petroleum, natural gas, boron, cement, sand & gravel, iodine, salt, and potash.",
            "The idea that Arizona doesn't have natural resources is completely wrong and ignorant in that a basic Google search would have told you otherwise.  \n\nArizona's economy was 'originally' based on the 5 Cs: copper, cattle, cotton, citrus, climate. In addition, Arizona has multiple other mineral resources. Gold (e.g. the most Dutchman gold mine legend) and uranium (e.g. the controversial plan to mine uranium outside the grand canyon).\n\nWhile it is a desert state there are multiple large water sources that early in the setting of the state provided abundant water for inhabitants and farming. That provided a reason to settle the state, and from there things snowballed and evolved. \n\nAdditionally, a significant portion of the state is not Phoenix and has rather mild summers--to the point of not regularly having air conditioning in homes and businesses. \n\nThough Arizona has grown dramatically, it (or parts of it, I can't remember) uses less water now than decades last when the population was a fraction of current due to more efficient use.",
            "Something non-obvious that I haven't seen mentioned yet is that due to low humidity, the temperature difference between shade and sunlight can be significant. Sweat evaporates quickly, which cools you much more effectively than it would in, say, Texas. This doesn't occur to people from more humid climates, where if it's hot, it's hot everywhere.\n\nIt can be 105F out and I'll be perfectly comfortable in the shade.

I'm more than likely going to move out of state or out of country.\n\nFuck this city. It needs to just die out",
            "Arizona is (or was) actually very rich with things like copper and silver. Several towns were established to mine all the precious goodies up. Some spots have now been mined dry and there's a bunch of old mining towns that are now dying, though others are still very active. I think some other towns were founded as just like a stop on the way to the west coast.",

            "Any time I've driven from Utah to Arizona I always have the same thought. Phoenix must have been settled by people who were like, well we're too tired to go back, but we better stop before it gets any worse.",
            "I'd just like to say that there is a common misconception that all of Arizona is hot and really just serves as a testament to humanity's arrogance.\n\nThat isn't the case, though.  The valley is hot in the summer - for sure... and even down south in the Tucson area it can be quite intolerable for most people.  The further north you go, though, the cooler the temperatures are.  In Flagstaff and around the Grand Canyon area temperatures are rather moderate and it even snows.  \n\nSomething else people tend to overlook is acclimation.  Just as people who live in Alaska or Siberia develop thicker skin and blood vessels deeper in their bodies to better maintain body temperature and survive in the cold, the body adapts to the heat, as well.  The skin becomes thinner and blood vessels move more toward the surface to allow for the more rapid dissipation of heat to maintain a safe body temperature.  It takes a little time though - a year or two before you're really used to the weather.\n\nOnce you're adjusted, you'll find it's very uncomfortable to be in different places.  For example, I'm from Ohio and have lived in Phoenix for ten years.  If I go home, the humidity makes it all but impossible for me to breathe.  I feel soggy, uncomfortable, and like the air is so very thick.  Here in Phoenix, though, I have no issue spending a few hours outside in 100+ degree weather - because it's something my body (and mind) is used to.\n\nThere are also a wide variety of food sources to be found in the desert.  Citrus and pomegranate grows readily here, as do various edible cacti.  In addition, there are, of course, a variety of edible animals and insects which live naturally in the area.\n\nWith regard to other natural resources, Arizona was once a destination for copper mining.  We even have a handful of ghost towns which were once functional copper mines.  We're also known for some other resources (cotton, cattle...).  \n\nOur state isn't all bad... actually, it's quite nice.  And honestly, the people you'll meet out and about are some of the nicest people you could ask for.  That might be our greatest resource of all.",
            "I've lived in AZ for most of my life. I've gotten use to the heat, for the most part.  \nIts also just cheap as shit. \nThe real answer is because of the resources back in the day.",
            "For Phoenix and the Salt River Valley in general, the land is agriculturally productive as long as you irrigate. There used to be a Native American civilization that lived in the area that were able to build a large system of canals; many of the paths they used are used today for modern canals. So, when settlers arrived to the area, they were able get good yields from crops provided that they irrigated. Some of the first federally managed dams that were built were built to serve these farmers. In return, the valley provided crops for export including off season vegetables.\n\nOutside the Valley and within the region, Phoenix supported mining operations. This included massive copper mining.\n\nAfter World War II, the region started seeing growth in manufacturing, specifically in electronics manufacturing. Given the local supply of raw materials and cheap electricity, companies like Motorola and Intel moved in and created factories to pump out electronics. Aviation companies like McDonnell-Douglas also moved in to take advantage of the low corrosive environment and clear days to conduct aviation testing.\n\nTourism was always part of the economy, especially winter tourism where people could walk around in a t-shirt in January. This picked up as flying became cheaper. Also, retirees used the area as a winter getaway, switching between there are their homes up north since it was cheap to buy a house down there.\n\nAs for air conditioning being a power draw, how many places around the world would be uninhabitable if you couldn't heat buildings? Heating takes up a lot of power too. The only difference is that heating can be done through other means than electricity.",
            "Phoenix was an agricultural area for millenia, farmed by the Hohokam and white settlers. The Salt and Gila Rivers, along with being in USDA zone 9+ made the area conductive for year-round agriculture, which most places in America cannot do. \n\nUS soldiers trained there during WWII and many decided to stay after the war. Phoenix is paradise for 8 months out of the year, and the invention of air conditioning sealed the deal for exponential population growth. \n\nNowadays, summer in Phoenix is like winter in most parts of the country. People stay inside much of the time until the weather becomes more bearable, and THAT is when the area shines.\n\nWater issues weren't a problem until recently. The water table used to be fairly high and if farmers used more cover crops to prevent evaporation and would do more dryland farming, there wouldn't be any reason to worry as that's where the vast majority of the water goes. Gilbert is refilling their aquifer at the riparian preserve and outside SW Arizona, the state is pretty mild. A lot of lush, cool areas with a lot of access to almost unlimited water.",

Most of what you're saying here is just factually untrue.\n\nNevada had more gold than California, and still had enough silver to be call \"The Silver State\". The Colorado River (used to) supplies enough water for the inhabitants living next to it. There are several exports for each state down there, not just including gambling and \"muh, cheap land\" (which would probably be cheaper in the midwest).\n\nRight now, we're experiencing heavy drought from, you guessed it, global warming and the lack of preemptive forest fire prevention. The Colorado River is about halfway down from where it used to be and California is on fire all the time. These cities aren't just popping up and developing, they've been here for hundreds of years now. We can't just pick up the millions of people in these situations that we caused and say \"Go buy yourself a nice house in Ohio or whatever, it's too hot were you live\".\n\nInstead of blaming victims of these horrible circumstances and saying \"Why do you live there?\", you should ask how to prevent these things from happening.

            "The West was thought to be great for new farming land, which is why it was initially settled. And it was, for a long while. It\u2019s hot and dry, but there was water enough to maintain farms and things. Add to this that there were a lot of mineable minerals and untapped oil deposits out West as well, and it became a very enticing place to settle.\n\nThe way farming was conducted was what really destroyed a lot of what *used* to be farmland. Farmers planted the same crops over and over again, didn\u2019t use the land during off seasons, and never planted what are called \u201cplaceholder\u201d crops. Placeholder crops are planted and grown to be tilled back into the soil, to add organic material and nutrients back into the land. Considering that never happened, the nutrients and organic material that was there already ran out and broke down, respectively. This led to lots of dust, which led to dust storms, which led to lots of farmland that wasn\u2019t yet ruined to *get* ruined.\n\nAnd eventually, the mines ran out. Settlers had effectively drained the land of all its precious and useful minerals in the area (gold, coal, and other high-value minerals), and there was nothing left but tunnels.\n\nA lot of the largest deposits of oil, too, were eventually fully tapped out, and became obsolete.\n\nBut because we were in the West for those reasons, and people had already picked up and moved out there, there was no point in picking up and going back. So folks settled down for good, and created some real cities and towns that weren\u2019t necessarily tied to farming or mining. Other industries found their way out there, and we eventually built up places like Vegas, where there are hubs of human activity in the middle of what\u2019s now mostly barren plains and desert.",

So we get a large city that seems like it shouldn't exist there if we think of it as a huge city from its creation. Vegas was a small town then mobsters introduced gambling which became a major cash income for the area despite it being in the middle of nowhere. By the time it became a huge tourist hub there was the technology and infrastructure around to support the population. Hoover Dam, AC, transportation infrastructure, etc. The only reason Vegas is still a city is because of tourism and gambling if you took it away there's no purpose to supporting a city there as there's no other industry there to justify it and it would not exist. \nOther cities that appeared to be far from resources and the middle of nowhere is either because it was a rail road town. It was a stop for trains resupply, drop off people like miners if there was gold and other things around. It's also a place people could lodge for the night and find prostitutes. Those railroad towns grew with the times and eventually diversified out of that industry to survive long after those initial industries aren't as massive anymore. \nOther cities were just trading outposts for fur, livestock and crops that also grew with technology.",

There's been a city here for three hundred years now and, if the water doesn't rise too high, the storms don't blow too hard the river doesn't switch channels then there'll probably be one for another 300 simply because if you want to go up the river you have to switch from an ocean going ship to a river boat somewhere and this is the closest place with the deepest water.\n\nThe music, food, and culture are unlike anywhere else in the U.S., but that's more of a perk than a reason.",

A few years of hard work saving the extra money could put you in a financial positive where you could retire early. What better way to spend money than to spend time not at work? We all seem to be programmed that you need to put in so much time at a job to make your life as comfortable as possible, but I think the idea is to make your money work for you. My suggestion is get a cheap apartment, sell everything and use public transportation. Forget what anyone says about social status because nobody really matters but yourself and where your life ends up. Rice and beans, live like a monk on bare minimum. Put all of your money except for the basics into income generation. Rent, and purchase nothing unless it is bringing you an income. Now that you have an income larger than you can deal with, use it to increase your cash flow with less time working for it. This is the general idea of what the american dream was supposed to be like, getting ahead of inflation, getting life insurance, planning for the future of unknown outcomes. What better way to live paycheck to paycheck than writing your own, money in the bank every month and you don't have to work for anyone.",

Take appliances that make cooking and home maintenance easier and cheaper.  Have Buy tools for the vehicle that you couldnt get before, or invest in repairs and maintenance you'd been putting off.\n\nOnce you get the basics out of the way, start seriously looking at getting a house. Get a downpayment together and get on that one asap. A mortgage adds to networth, rent subtracts from it. Already have one? Consider the viability of investing in a second one. Could you make more from rent then you would pay in a second mortgage? Are you in a city that has a reasonable or high demand for air bnb?

Save and invest that extra money into things that will earn you more money, like renting out a second house to someone else (I don't really have more examples but you can probably find some on Google).

            "Nothing new. Check out the various game ads that ran back in the late 1970s and 1980s, such as for the Atari 2600. For that era, the graphics shown in the ad often had little to no relation to the game at all.\n\nIt's comical looking back at those old ads. What's even more crazy is the prices of games, when adjusted for inflation, often exceeded $100. Not justifying false or misleading advertising, but rather it's nothing new. In my view, was far worse back in the early days.\n\nAs the old adage goes, buyer beware. The internet greatly helps avoid surprises. Many review sites, videos, etc out there. Plus, many on-line gaming platforms have decent refund policies.",

            "With NSFW posts, they are all clearly marked as being NSFW, so it's really easy to filter that stuff out. No one really tags all political posts, but if you want there are ways to filter out subreddits from your feed as well as keywords that may get most of the political stuff out:\n\nThere are a few different ways to filter out content you see on reddit:\n\n#**Option 1**: Filtering from /r/all (Works on mobile and desktop) \n-\nReddit allows you to filter out posts from specific subreddits in /r/all, however it's not easy to find. Subreddits can be added to your filter by going to the *desktop* website https://old.reddit.com/r/all/ and the filter will be near the top of the right sidebar. \n\nNote that you can only make changes to the filter from the old.reddit.com domain, however the actual filter is tied to your account, and will also filter out posts on the mobile app or on the redesigned desktop site. Also note that this filter **only applies to /r/all**, it will not work for /r/popular. There is no natively supported filter for /r/popular. \n\n#**Option 2**: Filtering from the desktop site\n-\nIf you want to filter more than just /r/all from the desktop site, you can using the browser extention [Reddit Enhancement Suite](https://redditenhancementsuite.com \"also /r/Enhancement\"). RES allows you to set site-wide filters based on subreddits, users, domains, flairs, and basically anything else. Filters set through RES will not carry over into the mobile app. If you do browse reddit on desktop, I would highly recommend RES even if you don't need to filter things, as it comes with a plethora of other great features as well. \n\n#**Option 3**: Filtering on mobile using a 3rd party app\n-\nWhile reddit's official mobile app does not support filtering, many of the 3rd party apps available on your respective app store do. There are actually a lot of great features that 3rd party apps have that the official one doesn't, so I would definitely recommend checking them out. There are a lot of great 3rd party apps out there, and everyone has different tastes, so I would recommend trying out a few of the high rated apps, and see which one you like the most before sticking with it. Here are some 3rd party apps that I know of that support filtering, although I'm sure many others do as well: \n\n* ~~Reddit is Fun~~ rif is fun for Reddit\n* Relay for Reddit\n* Now for Reddit\n* Sync for Reddit",

            "They would not work in the same way they work on earth, and you would find it difficult to force it to change orientation.\n\n[Article on how they work electronically](https://www.livescience.com/40102-accelerometers.html#:~:text=An%20accelerometer%20is%20an%20electromechanical,or%20speed%20divided%20by%20time.)\n\n[Video on how they work and are made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZVgKu6v808). The first half is probably what you're interested in.\n\nFrom the article:\n\n>dynamic accelerometer measures gravitational pull to determine the angle at which a device is tilted with respect to the Earth. By sensing the amount of acceleration, users analyze how the device is moving.\n\nThe basic accelerometer only measures along a single axis (forwards and backwards), but two or three of these can be combined for 2D and 3D sensing. Phones use 3D accelerometers because it's a marginal cost difference from 1D and 2D but allows for many more features and app compatibilities.\n\nOn Earth, whichever axis is oriented vertically will read the force of gravity as +/- 1 G (as seen in video animation). That direction must be \"down\".\n\nIn orbit where a person or object would experience zero G, all three axes would read 0, and the device would not know which direction is \"down\", and would not rotate itself based on its orientation.\n\nYou could possibly \"fake\" it by imparting an acceleration on the phone (by moving it or spinning yourself around), but I have suspicions that this would not be effective enough to make the device switch orientations. Accelerometers are very sensitive, so it would detect a change, but it may not be enough to convince the phone to change. \n\nFrom a design perspective, a device shouldn't \"overreact\" to minor acceleration changes like movements because it would be frustrating for users. Which is probably why when I spent a few minutes spinning around with my phone in different orientations it refused to rotate the screen. I couldn't impart a regular 1G of acceleration in any direction, so my phone wouldn't rotate the screen.\n\nIf we want to understand the code a bit better, we can turn the phone to landscape, and then set it flat on a table. Notice that it does not revert to portrait when flat. This tells me that it \"latches\" in place. It'll only change again if it's tilted back in the upwards direction. That means if you were to go up to space in portrait mode, there'd be no way to force it into landscape by tilting, and if you went up in landscape, it would similarly have trouble switching back to portrait (unless you force it there portrait-lock option). This is sort of a pain in the ass for frequent space-flyers.\n\nConsidering that 99.9999997% of smartphone users are currently not in space (a google search told me that there are 2.71B smartphone users, another told me there are 7 people in space right now, so I did the math), and there's probably no 5G reception up there either, it makes sense that smartphone manufacturers would design for users in a 1G environment rather than 0G.\n\nSome hard drives (particularly in laptops) use an accelerometer for free-fall detection. It detects that momentary apparent weightlessness of a free-fall, and stops the drive from performing read/write actions. The disk is spinning at extreme speeds with the head extremely close to the disk. [This forum post](https://superuser.com/questions/474609/are-there-any-disadvantages-of-having-a-free-fall-sensor-on-a-hard-disk-drive) describes it as a jumbo jet flying a few feet off the ground. A hard impact during a read/write can destroy the drive.\n\nThe same forum post also claims that free-fall detectors in a hard drive have ruined an experiment in zero G before due to disabling itself (not necessarily on a space station, but perhaps in a parabolic flight experiment). This would be further indication that accelerometers don't function well in zero G environments. I bet that NASA, ESA, etc. if bringing a hard drive to space use the ones without free-fall detection.",

            "This is the kind of important knowledge we need!",
            "Such devices usually use Micromachined-Electro-Mechanical-System (MEMS) gyroscopes, also known as vibrating structure gyroscopes. The gyro consists of small masses held by tiny oscillating silicon springs, each mass-spring system representing a plane. If the plane rotates (the device is rotated via yaw, pitch, or roll) a Coriolis force puts a stress on the system, changing the capacitance of a sensor. That change is measured and is deemed proportional to the rate of rotation.\n\nAll of that, in principle, works just fine in microgravity, but because the sensors are not space hardened, reliability can become an issue.\n\nHowever, since the orientation chosen by the inhabitants of the spacecraft varies, there isn't a consistent up/down direction as there is on Earth. That makes the orientation changes of the display annoying, so the mute switch is used to inhibit auto screen rotation.\n\nIf the crew want to change the orientation of the screen, they flip the mute switch, jerk the iPad to force the screen to rotate, and then activate the mute switch, again.",

These may still register, though very weakly. Also, the sun has it's own force on all objects, as does the moon. Remember, all of our ventures into space, have NOT been static (except on the surface of the moon).

The standard software in a phone will look for a steady 8-10 m/s^2 , so it wouldn't work in space, but the gravity of earth is still detectable in orbit, the vehicle just travels sideways fast enough that the gravity it \"feels\" keeps it in orbit rather than crashing it to the surface",

            "I was in the hospital for close to 3 weeks. I never really felt like masturbating. I normally do often but I think that because I was so sick I didn't. I also had a heart monitor on me 24/7 due to being in for heart failure so if my heart rate suddenly went up I would have had a nurse checking on me right away like the one time the wires on my heart monitor failed and I had a nurse running in my room thinking I had flat lined.",
            "A note from my mum who is a nurse;\n\nIf you're on a heart monitor, don't masturbate, you will find that you quickly have an audience when 5 nurses and drs burst into your room thinking you're in cardiac distress.\nApparently it happens more than you'd think, and it's always embarrassing for everyone haha",

Took 2 weeks to get my first erection post surgery, was happy beyond belief. My wife assumed I was masturbating the whole time but there were to many people around.

He pulled back his covers and he was like \u201cfuckin\u2019 check these out\u201d. He laughed about it.\n\nEdit/ My Dad actually showed me a photo of my brothers nuts lol, then when I saw my brother again next time I asked to see.

            "More often it\u2019s the ones coming in for observational tests. People being admitted due to illness are often not feeling up to it. \n\nThe classical examples are teenagers/young adults coming in for 24hr ECG monitoring. They get going in the middle of the night; which either raises their heart rate significantly, or, if the movement interferes with the electrodes, gives their heart tracing the appearance of someone about to arrest. \n\nThis heart tracing is shown on the nurses monitor outside, so they rush in thinking they might have to start CPR etc, only to find\u2026 that. \n\nThe other cohort are usually old men (and sometimes women) who either don\u2019t care, get off on it, or have some kind of brain injury leading to disinhibition. I\u2019ve had them masturbate while I\u2019m standing at the end of the bed. That\u2019s a bit grim.",

I was extremely horny (yay hormones!) but wasn\u2019t allowed even an orgasm because it could efface my already wimpy cervix more. I fought the incredible urge to rub one out for almost a MONTH. Then during a nap I had a sex dream and woke up in the middle of the most mind bending O! Then the nurses rushed in with medicine to stop my contractions because the tocometer (measures uterine contractions) went crazy.

Or sometimes the door is a sliding glass panel, like the door to your patio, so it isn't amenable to knocking.\n\nIf you have an IV, there is a long needle embedded in your elbow area or in the back of your hand and sometimes it is your dominant hand. I'm not jiggling that around thanks.\n\nEdit: In an IV, they use a needle to place a thin plastic tube in your vein that the solution flows through, but if you think that you don't feel it, you would be incorrect.",

Right as I was about to finish, the nurse rushed in (she had to know) and asked if I was OK. All disheveled, I said I'm fine. Here it is, my blood pressure shot up to 145 and they were worried something was wrong with my heart. Worst part is, they kept me for an extra day to make sure I was OK. Most expensive fap ever.",

I was pretty bored of being in the hospital at this point so even with no sex drive, I just wanted to see what would happen, just to break me out of the same boring cycle a little bit.

Might try talking to someone IRL instead but it could be really awkward.)\n\nI really don't understand how people can say masturbation is a sin when it's essentially unavoidable. I think sometimes it just happens, and it's best not to make a big deal out of it, and to try to make it easily cleaned up.

Heck I've had far fewer invasive sexual thoughts since jerking off quasi-regularly, so that should be a good thing from God's perspective, you would think.
