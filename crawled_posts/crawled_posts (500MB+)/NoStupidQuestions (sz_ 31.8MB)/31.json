            "Too soon to tell. There have been some truly awful presidents in U.S. history, but you don't really get the best picture until at least 30 years have passed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: A lot of the people lampooning me seem to think by not openly bashing him means I think he was a good president. That's not what I said, that's not what I implied, and that's certainly not what I think. Chill.",

            "You\u2019re not gonna get too many unbiased answers here\n\nBut in my opinion I\u2019d say for sure the most unprofessional. But far from the worst.",
            " I don't think that it is possible to fairly rank current presidents. I think it'll take 20-30 years to say either \"Yeah we was a terrible president\", or \"Maybe he wasn't as bad as we thought\" about presidents like Trump, Biden, and Bush. Plus it's hard to say any modern president is the worst when many presidents supported slavery. Trump has done some stupid stuff, but when you compare him to Andrew Johnson he really doesn't look that awful.",
            "I am far from a Trump fan but he is definitely not our worst president. There are plenty of presidents who have done bad or not even done anything to help the United States. So even if you don't like him, it's hard to argue he's the worst.",
            "Absolutely not. Buchanan and Johnson outright tried to undo or prevent African American rights. At the very least, Trump was not as bad as them.",
            "I think Andrew Jackson was the downright worst. Causing a financial crisis, being responsible for the Trail of Tears\u2026",
            "Trump was pretty bad in my opinion, it\u2019s still a little to early to see the full effects his administration had but we can by no means pretend he was the worst president in US history. Allow me to illustrate the (in my opinion) contenders for worst US president:\n\n1. James Buchanan - the 15th president, while dealt a bad hand with the whole slavery debate at a standstill, his actions (or rather inaction) directly led to the civil war breaking out. He was ineffective, did not solve problems, and let the civil start (the first states seceded while he was president). Trump was pretty bad, but is he as bad as Buchanan? Not in my opinion.\n\n2. Andrew Johnson - the 17th president, who was only president because Abraham Lincoln wanted to appeal to northern democrats and unite the country, deciding to make him Vice President over his incumbent VP in 1964, and the fact that Lincoln became the first president to be assassinated. Similar to Buchanan he was dealt a bad hand as he had to fix the country after the civil war. One small problem however, he was a southerner and actively worked against civil rights movements and reconstruction efforts. He was the first president to ever be impeached and was (if I recall) one vote away in the senate from being removed from office. Johnson\u2019s actions set the country backwards on civil rights for a century and the effects of that are still felt today over 150 years later. Trump was pretty bad,  it is he as bad as Andrew Johnson? Not in my opinion.\n\n3. Woodrow Wilson - the 28th president and probably the only slightly controversial opinion I have here was awful, I highly recommend the Cynical Historians videos about him. To sum up the video: Wilson was a tyrant who passed anti-free speech laws (that still exist), set up a quasi-militia-secret police thing, lied about involving the US into World War 1, was a awful historian, was racist (even when we consider the time period), only became president because his two more popular opponents split each other\u2019s votes, plus when he had a stroke his wife became de facto president and she was bad as well. Trump was pretty bad, but was he as bad as Wilson? Not in my opinion.\n\nTLDR: trump was bad or below average at least. He isn\u2019t as bad as Buchanan, A. Johnson, and Wilson though.",
            "Depending on your criteria, it would likely be Harding, Jackson, Buchanan, and your mileage may vary here but potentially Nixon, Reagan, or Truman.\n\nIn twenty years we'll know more about the longer term effects of Trump's presidency. He isn't going to be remembered fondly by historians barring a radical shift in both culture and politics, but it's pretty hard to top Jackson who was openly and proudly genocidal.",
            "Andrew Johnson, Woodrow Wilson, James Buchanan, Andrew Jackson, Warren Harding. No, I can't say he's the objective worst. Probably the worst of our lifetime tho.\n\nEdit: maybe that's not true either, Bush and his wars were definitely more destructive than Trump. \n\nTrump is far more unlikable and has more policies that I directly disagree with, but we can't forget Iraq and Afghanistan, pointless wars, pointless deaths.",
            "Andrew Jackson was pretty shit",
            "Depends on how you measure it, I think there is a real case that he was the most Unprofessional president we have ever seen. I mean where do I start, but if your going to look at tangible life under his presidency, we didn\u2019t enter any wars, foreign relationships were pretty good, there was a good stock market and overall job growth. So was he a \u201cgood\u201d president, absolutely not IMO, but I\u2019m sure there were presidents where life was worse under, but that\u2019s JMO, please respect it I\u2019ll respect yours \ud83d\udc4d",
            "As others said, it really depends on how you quantify \"worst\". I'm terms of GDP growth, up until the pandemic in the last year of his presidency, he wasn't bad. Same for unemployment. There have definitely been a lot of crappy presidents in the past, Wilson, Coolidge, Jackson, Buchanan. One can also argue that a lot of the issues we see today with income and wealth inequality had their seeds sown during Reagan's time with trickle down, supply side economics, the War on Drugs. So would Reagan get the blame for those or should Bush, Clinton, and W get the blame for not course correcting?",
            "I\u2019d argue that James Buchanan, Lincoln\u2019s predecessor, was the worst, followed very closely by Andrew Johnson, the successor to Lincoln.\n\nBuchanan was one of the biggest reasons why the Civil War came to be - an advocate of \u201cstate\u2019s rights,\u201d it\u2019s assumed that he rolled out the red carpet for Jefferson Davis to present the Confederacy. Rather than try to quell secessionist vibes, it was as if he was cheering on the Rebels and stoking the fires personally - sound familiar?\n\nJohnson, in turn, bungled the shit out of reconstruction. His total ineptitude and his desire to \u201clook good for the winning side\u201d helped establish the hatred and distrust the South would carry to this day. In fact, his antics could be considered a plausible possibility for today\u2019s version of racism, and may have been a reason why civil rights took forever to take root. (sound familiar?)\n\nTrump, while absolutely a terrible human being, is still alive and breathing. Because of this, we won\u2019t know the impact he\u2019ll have on this country past the immediate sense. However, with the above presidents in mind, it almost feels like he\u2019s on par, but definitely not quite the worst yet.",
            "I hated trump but even I'll admit I'm sure there's been worse. I think every politician has/will do something that one side of the country will consider them the worst. \n\nBut despite his general stupidity he wasn't the worst.",

I don't think history will be kind to his legacy. \n\n\nSome other presidents have individual actions, scandals or personality traits that lead some people to rate them as the worst. Like Andrew Jackson and the Trail of Tears, or people hating Woodrow Wilson lately because he was racist against African Americans, or Nixon and Watergate. \n\n\nI think when all is said and done that Trump will rate near the bottom with Harding but that Buchanan and Andrew Johnson will still be seen as worse",

            "Random redditors can\u2019t tell you that. Luckily, they do rigorous polling of US historians every time a president leaves office to rank the presidents. The last one was done in 2021 and [Trump was the third worst president in US history, according to historians.](https://www.c-span.org/presidentsurvey2021/?page=overall). You\u2019ll notice there are only 44 presidents listed even though Trump was the 45th. That\u2019s because ~~William Henry Harrison died a month into his presidency, before he could do anything of note. So they don\u2019t bother ranking him.~~ Cleveland had non-consecutive terms. (Sorry, brain fart)\n\nIf you click a president\u2019s name, you\u2019ll see their scores and ranking in specific categories. Trump did score dead last in Administrative Skills and Moral Authority.

He severely damaged the U.S. in almost every way.\n\nBut there were terrible presidents in the 1800's as well.",

Others did the job in stupid, corrupt, or downright evil ways; he never did the job at all. And it's not even his fault, in a sense; it's clear that he's not a fully-functional human being, who was lying even as he took the oath of office, which includes a pledge to \"faithfully execute\" the office \u2014 a concept which he is entirely incapable of understanding.

Since I live in Colorado I'd just have friends that would have their parents buy it then give it to them or they knew someone older or just someone that grew it then I'd buy it off of them. Shrooms were a bit more difficult with that I'd have to know someone that grew them usually I'd talk with friends and they would know someone. Shrooms were always a major bitch to get though but that's just my personal experience. I hope it helps your give you a better idea of how teens get drugs.",

            "When it comes to charging someone with a crime, its not what you know, but what you can prove.\n\nIn order to make an arrest, the police need probable cause. In order for the charge to turn into a conviction, the government has to be able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the person being charged did in fact commit a crime. \n\nIf someone were to walk up to a police officer and point to someone and say they were a drug dealer, how can it be proven? The police officer may even know that person to deal drugs, but with out any proof, it's just hearsay at that point. That police officer would need probable cause at that point in order to affect an arrest.\n\nIn the case of larger dealers, the probable cause is usually collected and a warrant is sought. All a warrant is is a statement of probable cause given to a judge, and based on what was presented, a judge can issue a warrant. This could be done for a search of an area, arrests, seizure of property, or combination of everything.\n\nIts not that the police aren't aware of who the drug dealers are, there are just a lot of rules and steps involved in order to arrest someone.",

Most gas stations sell a lot of alcohol, and losing their license means losing a lot of income. They make deals with the kids. They threaten them with trumped up charges if they don\u2019t comply.

You wouldn't go bump into him and go \"hey, an Intel Core i9-10980HK has 16MB of L3 cache\" because while factually true, there's no reason to say it.  Similarly unless he's actively pondering the question of if his mother has ever done porn, or is specifically doing something he wouldn't do if he knew, there's no honesty-related reason to volunteer an answer.\n\nSecondly - while I appreciate a lot of people are concerned about \"revenge porn\", anonymously contacting her from a fake profile is also a pretty creepy thing to do and could be seen as a blackmail attempt.  I'd avoid it unless you have a good reason to think there's an issue.\n\nThirdly - some people are just lookalikes.  There are billions of humans on this earth.

How is this relevant, you might think?\n\nWell, let me tell you; part of my study involves research of language being innate, to this end, I looked at research into honeybees.\n\nHoneybees communicate via something we've labelled as \"waggle dance\" which involves shaking their back in specific directions, speeds, and intensities; each relays certain information... usually a map towards nearest food sources.\n\nThe researcher, karl Van Frisch, took Austrian honeybees and put them in an italian hive; instinctually, the bees knew their job was to gather food, however, when the Austrian honeybee did its waggle dance, it was found that the Italians did not know what the Austrian was doing, thus failed to find the food source the austrian honeybee located.\n\nConsidering this, it is somewhat safe to conclude that each species of animals and insects, that, whilst kinda sounding exactly the same to us, is not the same for cats; that beingng said, there is always the possibility of stumbling upon a sound that each will recognise to mean the same thing, and then we'll cats defining languages the same way humans do (that's a stretch. languages are pretty difficult)",

            "I'm gay and a lot of us have said this, it feels silly to keep making the acronym longer. Majority of the world only knows/uses LGBT, that's how it was originally and that's the most popular version. It doesn't mean other identities are less valid or anything, it's just keeping it short like before, but i do think the + should be included.",
            "I think its so that other identities are also prominent in the initialism and not just condensed to a plus sign, but you can never get to every label so you tack on the plus too. I dont fully get it either though and Im LGBT. Personally I just say LGBT without the plus and hope people fill in the rest.",
            "The additional letters are generally meant to show that the other groups are in fact included. There are unfortunately lots of people both in and out of the community who do not accept certain flavors of gender and sexual minorities. Like the \"drop the T\" movement or the general erasure of asexuality. By putting something like LGBTA, you're specifically saying \"I support asexuals,\" etc. \n\nIt's the same reason why there have been updated versions of the pride flag that specifically include trans or asexual representation. That being said, I don't find many people that *take issue* with just saying LGBTQ or LGBT+ or using the traditional rainbow flag, unless the person using it is doing so specifically to exclude others. They just like to draw extra emphasis to those groups that have frequently been excluded when it's applicable.\n\nI think broadening acceptance is generally more important than whether or not the acronym is \"unwieldy,\" but regardless, everyone uses shorthand when it's convenient anyway. Nobody but a group of fringe pedants is going to care that much about what term you use so long as you're using it in good faith.",

You can say \"LGBT+ community\" to keep it concise. \n\nAlso please remember that LGBT+ people use labels for THEMSELVES, not for you. We use labels to be able to accurately find resources, connect with communities who share similar experiences, and concisely describe our sexual/romantic/gender identity to people who recognize the label. We do not use labels to \"flex\" on people, and we also don't expect you to know each label. \n\nStraight cisgender people have a great time pretending this is an inconvenience for them when this is a tool for connection and support for us.

            "Short answer from a massive advocate for my community here: no fucking clue, you're right, its counterintuitive\n\nSlightly longer answer: It may have come about because adding more letters to LGBT to include more people happened before someone decided to just stick a plus on the end. But the momentum kept going, coz people want to see themselves included in the acronym used by their community explicitly rather than implicitly. If they're included implicitly, in a '+', its very easy for certain groups/identities to be challenged and deliberately excluded (eg. aromantic/asexual people as of recent). This is just my guess though. Side note it sucks that queer history is taught approximately nowhere in detail because stuff like this gets easily lost; rationales, details, reasoning, etc.",

We all deserve to be proud of who we are.\n\nThe acronym with letters and plus can make it seem like anyone who doesn't identify as or fall under lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning, intersex, and asexual, isn't as important and thus is only to be relegated to plus.\n\nWe're all just as important as the next one, regardless of how we identify, and I think it's completely fair to just use Pride.",

The + means that there are more letters following! The first few letters aren't the only minorities that matter, they're just a familiar acronym to identify the group represented by the + (which is sexual/gender/romantic minorities). There are SOO many letters, we're always going to have to exclude some unless you want like a 200+ letter acronym which makes no sense. \n\nExcluding a letter is not saying that that letter doesn't matter, it's just for ease of reference. Saying LGBT+ references ALL OF US. \n\nIn essence, the only people getting mad and wanting to add more letters don't understand language and are kinda dumb.",

Most people probably don't ask and never would think too. It's YOUR personal business. My sexuality affects nobody else. I've never purchased a flag to display to tell anyone about it. \n\nSo I don't know what the purpose of the new letters is, I have heard that it's to block discrimination, and that + is simply non-inclusive or something like that.",
            "There's a divide in the community between those who just use LGBT+ as an umbrella term and those who prioritize hyperspecific labels so you can find LBGT+ people who use variations in the term.\n\nI personally think adding labels and colors to the \"brand\" makes it weaker in terms of cis people becoming more familiar with it.\n\nAlso the flag doesn't need more colors because the rainbow conceptually include every color, that's the point of the flag.",
            "It\u2019s kinda dumb in general lmao. LGBT+ is enough. Q works instead of the + but it doesn\u2019t account for stuff like intersex, asexual, etc. so the plus is much better",

You could probably count on one hand the number of people who are going to remember this acronym...  \"LGBTQQ2SIAA+\" does nothing other than make the LBGT+ community less visible (ironic considering this is an attempt to increase visibility) and it ensures that people will forget it and thus forget about our community.    \n\n\nNot only is \"LGBTQQ2SIAA+\" obnoxious, it's also not \"all-inclusive\" nor will it be until it includes ALL sexualities & gender indentities (of which there are hundreds).

It's always a positive to seek understanding, no one minds as long as it's respectful. \n\nTo answer your question the + isn't there as an etc... which is what I think most people outside or new to the community interpret it as, but as a symbol that recognizes that Queer* identities and our understanding and categorization of them is constantly evolving and changing. Some things change names depending on cultural factors, generational divides, gaps in our collective knowledge and many other factors. The + is supposed to acknowledge that and welcome people who may belong to a fringe community due to cultural or personal identity reasons or people who simply do not want or have not found a label to represent who they are.\n\nSome people in this thread have pointed out already that Queer* is an umbrella term and you're right! But Queer* has a very complicated and controversial history that makes it unsuited to be a broad representative of the LGBTQIA+ as a whole since many people do not see themselves as Queer* and emphatically reject that label.\n\nAs for the difference between Lesbian and Gay (men/mascs), as some people have pointed it out as well, it might seem like a pedantic division from a language point of view but historically the Lesbian community has a very marked intersectionality with Women's Rights movements which makes them a separate and individual community from Gay Men/Mascs, hence why they are represented in the acronym.\n\nThe LGBTQIA+ has a rich and full history that has unfortunately been much neglected in the mainstream media and with the younger generations, partly due to a lack of elders to tell it, but I hope what little I was able to share was both interesting and answered your question regarding our acronym. Oh, and happy Pride Month! :)\n\n*I have used queer here because I personally endorse the use of queer as an umbrella term/identity but this is not at all a viewpoint shared by all members so please ask your friend/acquaintance about their personal stance before calling them queer or you could find yourself in quite the awkward situation.",

I also run the music program for the church, so a lot of these people I know fairly well. If it's someone I was close to, I will refuse payment, and I know that's the same for everyone else involved.

You don't have to have the wake, but I would suggest doing one unless you only expect like 25 people. You can have a small visitation at the church for an hour before the funeral. I don't think that costs extra. We'll be there setting up anyway. I suggest you skip the flowers in favor of prayer cards. I keep some in my church binder and it's a nice reminder. Get a book for people to sign from a craft store or Amazon for like $12. \n\nAlso, if you have the body cremated, they will return the ashes in a paper box if you ask.

            "It's funeral homes taking advantage of the grieving family for one thing.    Many people don't know that there's something called \"the funeral act of 1984\" that sets out guidelines funeral homes must follow but usually don't because people have never heard of this act and they're in shock.\n\nWhen my father died, I made a joke I should have bought a casket from my town as there was actually a retail casket store. The director fairly got mad and went on a rant.   Caskets are a major mark up for funeral homes.  \n\nHowever, by law, you are allowed to supply your own casket in all states but two.   Walmart actually sells caskets online and you can have it shipped to you within two days.  What you may pay for at walmart that's 1.6k could be 4k or more for the exact same casket.\n\nCaskets are very cheaply made to start with.   The casket gasket is extremely thin.   Run your hand on the gasket of your fridge and it's much more thicker.   \n\nThe funeral home will ask you about what you want, service, visitation, etc. and in my case, then they pull out this menu like thing with the prices on it.  How nice, they actually have all their services listed on a menu.  This required by law.  Rather than at the last, it needs to be presented before anything is said.\n\nWhen my mother died the old gal said \"now, we'll look at caskets and pick one from this room.\"  Wrong.    The funeral act states the list must be present prior to looking at caskets.  Surprise, surprise, my mother had a burial policy but a week later a neighbor who died did not.  The neighbor was in a basic steel grey casket not offered to us.   \n\nWhen I mentioned to the director later, he said the list is provided upon request.  How can you ask for it if you don't know it exists?   \n\nCemeteries are next on the list of scam artists.   They're out in force on decoration day wanting donations for money but then they won't keep it up, remove curbs to make life easier for them and are only looking to sell lots or make sure what salary they get is paid to them.",

I love kids, and I think I'm decent with them (even if I look enough like an ogre to make babies cry on sight).\n\nI was divorced from my first wife at the end of 2012, and got full custody and decision-making authority for both kids, because my wife had some serious and dangerous mental health issues. They've lived with me (apart from their mom) since they were six and four, respectively. I was spared from a lot of this kind of judgment for years, for a couple of reasons: first, I was so damn busy trying to work full time and be a good dad that there wasn't time to go hang out in parks or whatever, where the judgy people would have seen us; and second, my social circle was small, and I was very open with all of them about everything, so they knew from the first moment what our situation was. They were all supportive, and I didn't deal much with the general public in terms of the kids.\n\nBut then about five years ago I got remarried, and when the pressure of just trying to survive was off (because there were two of us), I started getting out more, and I would see it. Women, especially, are untrusting toward me; the men don't care as much, or don't seem to. No one's ever accused me of anything, but I get the weird looks and the cold shoulder and the nervous behavior and all that. And it's not only about kids; it's part of a bigger problem of sexist attitudes, because I get this sometimes in other contexts. For example, I work in a mental health clinic where about 90% of the staff are women, including literally everyone else in my department. The previous supervisor (now thankfully gone) didn't know how to deal with me at all, and I still think she was afraid of me. She wouldn't come to tell me things when she told the others; she'd just leave me out of meetings, announcements, etc., and I'd have to hear it from my coworkers. It's frustrating, but what can you do? None of this is the kind of behavior that you could make a complaint about, and in the case of the kiddie situations, who would you even complain to? So I learn to live with it, and just always watch myself so as not to end up in a situation where I could be accused of something.",

            "So I can answer this 2 fold -\n\nI\u2019ve worked with kids my entire life, I was a pre school teacher, football coach, holiday clubs and worked in cr\u00e8ches and now I still work with young people 20+ years later. It\u2019s always something I\u2019ve been aware of, wrongly, but I\u2019ve just got on with it and if anything used it as an opportunity to prove the \u2018stereotypes\u2019 wrong. \n\nChanging a kids nappy that isn\u2019t your own isn\u2019t fun (or your own kids!) be it a boy or a girl, it\u2019s a baby that you are responsible for and part of caring for a child involves taking care of any of its needs, but the initial looks I would get were horrendous, but after time I got used to it and it became normal and when I talk to young people now about work and careers, if we talk about early years childcare it\u2019s something we talk about. Also, now as a social worker and experience in the area, children are far more likely to be abused by a family member / someone they know.\n\nI work with young people now who have had incredibly challenging starts to their lives and some, not all respond better to a man working with them based on their understanding and start too life, but what\u2019s most important over that is they have people around them who are emotionally intelligent and able to talk to them on a level that works for them, much like being a parent - it doesn\u2019t matter if you are a same sex couple, a single parent or a heterosexual couple, being a good parent is being a good parent and role modelling how to get on with people of all genders etc is part of that, they don\u2019t need a male and female (in my opinion)\n\nPeople also always assumed I was gay, maybe it comes from being comfortable in my own skin and being perfectly able and happy to sing a song to a baby one minute whilst rocking them to sleep and then playing football the next - things that I am more than aware do not make you gay, but the stereotypical nature of being that comfortable with yourself I guess on occasion had led people to come to their own conclusions. One that I couldn\u2019t care less about, I have just always found in interesting. \n\nAs for now a parent - generally I\u2019m the only man at the play group or the baby swimming class, I couldn\u2019t care less though, my work has flexibility in hours to I take my youngest whenever I can - my eldest the same when I can after school. What is funny though is when in a swimming group we start singing nursery rhymes and because of my previous work I know all the words, so we bust out some teddy bear teddy bear turn around, the parents who don\u2019t know me\u2019s reaction to a heavily tattooed man with giant holes in his ears that they expect to drag his knuckles on the floor, is always a funny sight. But I take pride in talking to and about being a man who cares for all the young people I\u2019ve ever worked with and being a good role model for my boys.",

            "tl;dr: Same shit happened to me. \n\nWe\u2019d always had such a tiny family of all boys, so when my older brother had a daughter we were all psyched. I live about a 2-hours drive away from my niece and I rarely am able to visit. But I had a great idea. I love philosophy since it\u2019s essentially the greatest hits of things that humans have thought. And there\u2019s this novel called Sophie\u2019s World where a young protagonist receives cryptic cards in the mail that ultimately teach her how to think philosophically. In the end it\u2019s revealed they\u2019d been sent by I think her grandpa or someone. So I started doing a version of that. Another detail about my family is that I\u2019m the only one who went to college, let alone grad school. The rest of my family is superstitious, conservative in a bad sense, and make up answers to questions so as to not seem dumb for not knowing every possible thing. So I was motivated to be a positive role model regarding her smarts, as well as making it a bit of a game. I had the cards custom printed and everything it was like a whole project for me. After sending the first card I explained the premise of the book to my brother and his wife. My brother seemed on board. But then after the second one he literally told me that it seemed creepy. That really f*cking sucks. Our tiny family finally grows a bit and now I can\u2019t even be a cool uncle to my niece from a distance because my brother is irrationally uncomfortable. I\u2019m not able to have kids but I\u2019m great with kids so I always looked forward to being the funny uncle. But apparently I have to wait and see if my other brother will have kids.

            "This post brought up a memory that really has nothing to do with original question. I remember as a young male, maybe 6 or 7, definitely under 10 (I\u2019m 47 now so sorry if details on age are fuzzy) was playing with a young girl (4 or 5?) in my bedroom as her parents were visiting my parents. We were wrestling on the bed and I laid on my back to rest. She jumped on my stomach and sat on top of me. She started unbuttoning the front of my shirt, think she was fascinated with the shiny buttons. I was tired from wrestling and just laid there letting her do her thing. Thinking nothing about it. She undid about 3-4 buttons so my shirt was half unbuttoned when her mom stepped to the door to check on us. I never had a sexual thought about this girl. Just two innocent kids rough housing with each other and taking a break. But as I lay there on my back on my bed, with this girl straddling me and my shirt half unbuttoned I could see from the look in her moms eyes that something wrong was happening. It suddenly dawned on me how this might look to her but my kid brain didn\u2019t know what to say to that look on her face. She grabbed her daughter and I heard her making an excuse to my parents about how they got to go. Nothing ever came of it. Nothing was ever said to me but they never visited again and here at 47 that brief moment in time still bothers me.",
            "I know this started as a question and became sad depressing story time. \n\nBut as for an actual answer, it's likely due to common misconceptions around mens sexual activity vs women (the stereotypical men always want sex and women never want sex).\n\nAnd unfortunately, this is a positive feedback loop. Any time a male pedophile is found it reinforces the stereotype and if it's a woman pedophile going after a male child it is often (depending on the child's age) seen as the child getting what they want.\n\nNote that I'm speaking super generally and there areany situations that fall out of what I've described. However, societal perception in this regard reinforces itself.\n\nEdit: there are loads of other reasons too based on stereotypes. Men are predatory and woman are caregivers, women like looking after children men dont, mother's intrinsically love their children more than father's do.

And some people don't know or care to. \n\n\nIt is only recent and in certain cultures that women's rights have come far enough for women to be seen as independent sexual beings with their own desires and needs. Some of this still exists in that men are seen as more sexual beings than women. Men are seen to have uncontrollable sexual desires. In part i would say this contributes to a narrative about women and men's sexuality.\n\n\nAdditionally, it is only recently and in certain cultures that women have been able to be independent financially, have jobs etc. Generally, women have been the child rearers and home makers. We still have many narratives about how women are naturally meant to be around children and men aren't, that it is unnatural for men to want to be around children because this would be womanly... or there is another reason that fits with the other narratives about men as sexual. \n\n\nWhether it's because of these narratives in part or in whole would be up for debate. But statistically men commit more violent and sexual crimes against women and children. Sure, women do it too. But it appears they do it less and when they do it it goes unrecognised/doesn't change our brain's shortcuts because it doesn't fit the narratives we already have. Also, the narratives explored above, as well as others about what femininity/masculinity is, prevent men from reporting. \n\n\nTl;dr: gender roles and brain shortcuts.",

            "Just a heads up, a human-form tuxedo won't work even if it's the right size. Llamas, like other animals, have their arms \"to the front\" (imagine your arms raised directly forward, permanently). The chest line on the front is way shorter than on the back. Tuxedos/blazers aren't made to be worn while moving your arms to the front, which is why some old-time uniforms like rowing blazers had an opening at the back otherwise they would rip right through the mid-back line.\n\nYou're better off getting a pattern online for a dog tuxedo and working with that, then altering the measurements as needed. Or even better, buy a ready made large sleeveless dog tuxedo so you don't have to worry about leg movement and the llama won't suffer heatstroke or something.\n\nSource: Used to work in fashion and I love animals lol",

If it decides it doesn't want to do something then it will take 4 strong adults to persuade it to go. If it gets annoyed, it will start spitting vast green gobs of foul-smelling half-digested grassy compost. If it gets really mad and decides to lash out, its front claws are perfectly capable of giving someone a really serious injury.\n\nA well-trained, expertly handled llama can be a lovely guest at an event, but it takes a considerable time to get them to this state. If you are thinking of hiring a llama, make sure you talk in detail with the handler about what the llama will or will not accept in terms of clothing.\n\n(Source: have two pet llamas, either of whom would go completely apeshit if you tried dressing them up in anything or taking them into a room full of strangers)",

Hang the 'tux' over the llama's neck and have it connect behind the legs. If the llama is okay with that you could try adding 'tux tails' by pinning two strips to the back of the llama. \n\nYou can probably use velcro in small amounts if that is the only way, but remember llama's have hair and it could get caught, which will upset the llama. \n\nYour idea probably looks much better, but may take more time than is realistic. \n\nTo answer your question on llama size. There are many breeds and many more differences based on age and coat thickness for the climate. If your llama is from a petting zoo and its job is for petting only, it is most likely a standard breed, but a smaller size. It might compare to a pigmy horse. You might not be familiar with that so it might be close to the biggest dog you've seen multiplied by 2, maybe 3.
