You need to make money off something to keep it going or just have deep pockets and be happy to lose money for no reason. Plus I never seen a coffee shop a some social place like a bar. As you pointed out. \n\nTruthfully is coffee shops get people who are looking to keep to do their own individual thing. Some gather but a lot want to study and read.  Coffee is not something you binge drink on like booze. That prevents the other social aspect of it.  what business owner wants a full shop of customers with a minimal purchase and tying up space for hours.

People routinely buy 4-8 drinks in a bar at a higher price point.\n\nIn reality if you want somewhere you can hang out for multiple hours, they need a way to monetize you.\n\nEdit: And though I'm sure redditors will come out of the woodwork to tell me im wrong and that they dont fit this mold, typically late night spots like this would be for people who don't have a lot of disposable income. Theres a reason why everytime you go to a spot like this (in thinking of the 24/7 diner) its either young people or homeless. All of the business professionals and families are home in bed.

They have baristas that are more inline with mixologist, so you're paying $20-75/ drink making turnover not nearly as critical.

You could also rent a computer to use. There wasn't a whole lot of socializing because people were working, but there were occasionally study groups that socialized. Seattle is a Mashup of many colleges just a bus ride away, so occasionally there would be a \"which one\" or \"what course\" conversation or a \"that smells good, what are you drinking?\" But again, most people had their headphones in and ignored everyone else.",

Im not talking about wealthy people that want to see the world burn either. Biden was considered a strong candidate to win the nomination but after some of the nonsense with trump and bidens son, he started to lose support and bernie started to gain in the polls. The general sentiment is that, if bernie is elected we will see another four years of trump. When biden started to dip in the polls, bloomberg jumped in the race to see if he could make up for a potential biden crash. Bloomberg is not on the ballot for any of the states who have voted so far, and he isnt for south carolina either so he would not yet have picked up any votes. The idea is that we can see whether biden is able to beat bernie on his own and so far he has not been able to. If biden doesnt win south carolina, there are questions about whether he should continue to split the vote or if support should swing to somebody else like bloomberg. There are some serious concerns about bloomberg, yes, but hes also done some really great things as well. The media tends to be really black and white with these things because clickbait pays gets people reading headlines and the media is run by companies just like anybody else. News has been really divisive later and frankly its frustrating me to no end. It doesnt help that russia is stoking divisiveness with troll farms trying to get people on both the left and right pissed off about different items. You cant look at somebody like bloomberg and say that hes all bad and not acknowledge that hes done some reallt great things whether it is on gun control, health or education.  frankly, this is what bernie was saying when he was trying to say that some countries like cuba had done some good things despite absolutely atrocious behavior.

            "So this is genuinely a fascinating subject because the thing is that kids have, essentially, their own culture, and it is passed down from kid to kid, and we largely forget all about it as adults. What usually happens is that an older child (sibling, cousin, schoolmate, whatever) teaches something to a younger one, and then the younger one passes it on to their friends, and some of them eventually pass it down. It's true for songs like the one you mentioned in the OP, it's true for urban legends (especially around schools!), it's true for certain games (especially rhyming/clapping/skipping rope games), and it's true for certain symbols or drawings (the \"Superman S\" is the first to come to mind). Adults don't teach these things to kids; kids teach them to other kids, and eventually they grow up and forget but the culture lives on in the next group of kids and the next and so on. I learned about it when I was studying psychology in college and it nearly convinced me to change my major to anthropology just so that I could study this instead!\n\nEDIT: To answer a few questions I'm seeing repeated...\n\n* Yes, I know it's not a \"Superman S\", but that is one of the names for it, and we do know where it came from! There's a [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_S) all about it. Go nuts. A bunch of people are also linking [this video](https://youtu.be/RQdxHi4_Pvc) on the Universal S from YouTube channel LEMMiNO. If you're about to link it too, please have mercy on my notifications.\n* No, I don't know what exactly this field of study is called. I learned it as \"memetic cultural transmission in childhood\" or \"playground culture\". I also don't have a reading list.\n* Yes, shows like Recess and Codename: Kids Next Door do have a grain of truth in them!\n* Yes, kids are bloodthirsty, feral little bastards, lmao. So are adults, we just hide it better.\n\nThanks for the awards, and if you're going to spend real money I implore you to please donate to a local charity that helps kids be kids instead. They need the support, especially in a time when childhood looks totally different from anything we've ever seen.",

We had a lot of those playground rhymes that were terrifyingly violent, along with rumours that there was a secret episode that Barney said the word 'Fuck' on live TV. I think I spreads like wildfire when kids visit or move somewhere else, hence the slight change in words. \n\nIf anyone is interested in this phenomenon of kids always somehow knowing one of those weird rhymes, I'd suggest [Tom Scott's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5u9JSnAAU4) about the nursery rhyme \"jingle bells, batman smells\" and how different it is in different countries and regions.",

My advice is don't spend thousands on higher education unless you're sure that's what you want to do. The only class I was ever good at was Biology, so I went that way. I ended up dropping out of college because I don't like working in labs with no windows. It took me roughly 15 years, and many many jobs later, that I just don't really like being around people that much. With this in mind and my love for Biology, I put myself through online courses for Medical Transcription - I now type up doctors reports in the comfort of my own home, something I could never could have guessed I would be doing at age 16. I don't get paid too terribly much, but it really works for me and I feel more fulfilled than ever. \n\nI have never regretted dropping out, I've saved so much money and I paved my own path (though I don't think my folks will ever forgive me). I'm obviously not recommending being this impulsive, but I followed my heart each step of the way, and I'm ever so thankful I did. \n\nYou do you. \n\nAlso Alan Watts videos on Youtube greatly helped calm my 'wtf-am-I-doing' feelings.",

If there's an academic topic that interests you, you can still dig into it with the knowledge that it won't necessarily be your lifetime career.",
            "I hate that schools make you feel like that.\nI think the best approach is to study stuff you like and/or apply for jobs you are interested in\n\nLike my school was telling us that studying a langauge is a good way of getting into uni when we were 14 and not even thinking about uni.\nSo many kids did it just incase because they were scared that not going to uni meant not having a future but not going to uni is not the end of the world.\n\nDon't do anything you don't actually want to do.\nLike don't pick a subject you don't like over one you do like just because you think the one you don't like makes you more employable.\n\n and don't just study something because you just met the requirements for it. A lot of institutions (at least where I live) host some really poor degrees with qualifications with low entry requirements.\n\nIf you dont meet the grades to get into the good degrees you're litterally better off finding a different route into the industry than wasting your time on a bad qualification.\n\nTons of people actually discover what they want to do when they're middle age so you really don't need to worry too much if you don't have a plan at 16.",

Who ever is asking this of you, is probably just trying to motivate you into thinking about your future and, obviously, has done a good job. Don't stress about it fr.

Youtube how to code Python and see if you enjoy coding,  etc.\n\nYou might also spend $14 bucks on Amazon and order the MBTI personality test to get a baseline for what you're strengths and weaknesses are. I don't recommend the online tests as they aren't very accurate and are designed to get mouse clicks, not produce accurate results. Based on your MBTI you can look at common jobs your MBTI type finds success in. \n\nOther thoughts, maybe join some clubs in high school. I was on debate team and scholar bowl. I hated one and loved the other. Might give you some insights. It's all about experiencing what you can to get a feel for what you enjoy and find passion in. Your passions won't always line up with the job market, so consider starting your \"ever changing\" life goals. Do you want financial success or be a starved artist who enjoys what they do? This can also give you insights on what you should pursue. \n\nBest of Luck.",

The majority of my friends graduated high school and started working in downtown in the fashion district, but I didn\u2019t stress out about what to do with my life since I still had several years to go until graduating college.\n\nWhile at college, you\u2019ll have to take general education classes that are required for any major. There are specific sets of classes you have to take for specific majors, but you don\u2019t even have to worry about that during your first two years. Lots of people start with an interest in sociology or psychology and then pivot their majors because they found something that interested them during their first two years.\n\nYou can also change majors at anytime! There are older people that attend these classes after deciding they wanted a career change. Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t know what you want to do now. Just focus on school and going into college. \n\n*I ended up changing my major from psychology into business marketing at CSUN and am currently the Senior Director of Content Marketing at a fairly large agency.

There's this guy, Pink, that's figured out what makes people motivated at work. And it's three categories: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. Figure out which of those categories speak to you most. Once you figure out which speaks most to you, think about the things you have a natural inclination towards. What subjects do you most enjoy? What classes come easiest?\n\nOf course, the real world doesn't work like school work. So when you widdle it down, imagine yourself in that work scenario. Imagine the day to day. Can you see yourself behind a desk? What about your co-workers? What about staticism versus dynamicism?\n\nFind your internal motivators. Find your natural strengths. Find your day to day needs.\n\nIt's still a difficult process. And even then you have to execute. And it still might turn out bad. That's life.\n\nBut those clues should help you along.\n\nEdit: i hate all the answers that are like \"it doesn't matter,\" \"you can't,\" etc. In a way, they're right. You need life experience. You need job experience. But it *does* matter. That's why we have all these people in unfulfilling job roles asking for loan forgiveness.\n\nI realized I couldn't be a programmer when I was in my programming structures class and noticed I seriously disliked all the people I was surrounded by. Those were my future coworkers. People I would be spending the rest of my life around 40 hours a week. I realized I couldn't be a zoologist when I thought about the job prospects and the likelihood of being a poop-scooper a fair portion of the time.\n\nYou have to be able to imagine the reality of your choice. Don't buy into the fantasies.\n\nNow, there is something to say about letting life take you in its flow. You realize what makes you happy in actuality, not just theory. You make moves out of necessity and find the right mix of what you need versus what you want.\n\nBut as far as personal direction goes, follow my advice above. Figure out what's most important to you: making a difference, having control, or being the best. Then figure out what field you want to apply that to. Then finally imagine your life in that role. If something doesn't feel right, back track. Always give yourself a way back. Don't over commit.\n\nYou're young. You have time. You have options. Don't remove yourself from those privileges.",

She is also pushing for conservatory now after college.\n\nMy son fell in love with debate and theatre. Went to Nationals for novice in his first year and took 4th, and is participating in the local city theatre troupe and his high school productions (they are doing radio plays due to covid).  Now he has decided he is going to use those skills to help him when he goes for poli-sci and history in college in 4 years.\n\nThis isn\u2019t all to say how awesome they were and I have wonderful kids, it is more as an example to show what high school is supposed to be about.

That shit changes fast.\n\nStudy hard, play harder. Find something that you enjoy doing and aim for that to be your career. You\u2019ll be 500% happier with a career focusing on something that you are interested in.\n\nMost importantly, when you have a vague idea, make a solid plan and stick with it . At your age I had a lot of college tutors attempt to persuade me in to particular career paths & universities because it fitted the college\u2019s agenda. Don\u2019t let people discourage you from your goals. \n\nTo summarise, don\u2019t stress. You have a long time ahead of you and plenty of time to discover what you do and don\u2019t like in life.",

            "I know I will get the downvotes but here is the truth:\n\nPeople figure out what to do with their life at different ages. The earlier the better. The successful people at 23-25 are usually the ones who figured it out at 16 or earlier.\n\nHow? Well, they are not stupid and useless. They knew what they liked and pursued it. They did not let anyone tell them their dreams are stupid and/or impossible. And surprise, surprise they succeed.  Personally, I always say, \"Lucky me! I did not know it was impossible, so I did it.\".\n\nIf you do not have at least 3-4 things you want to do as a grown up by the time you are 16, well... you might be on the special side of the spectrum. No worries, McDonalds will always hire you. Or at least Amazon. Then after couple of years slaving there, you will start reinventing yourself. Yes, you will be close to 30 and have tens of years of catching up to do, but who is counting, really. Nobody cares at this point. Only you and your family.\n\nHowever, if you have at least 3-4 things that you want to be as an adult, then it is not, \"How to know\", but \"How to choose\". And that is a different topic. Just stop blaming \"the world\" that it is making you choose. Shift your perspective from, \"I am too young to know\", to \"I might be late! Better start now! Back in the day people at 16 used to start families. I still have nothing to my name.\" and then figure out how to become someone.",

We are all just lost and flow with the stream as best we can ... most of us even spend a good chunk of our lives paddling against the stream, with great suffering to follow.\n\nThe sooner you realize there is no \"right\" or best choice to make, the sooner you can free yourself from the pressure to do what is right.",
            "Idk if you'd read this or not, or if you'd consider it worthy. But not every 16 yr old asks such question, so I felt obligated to answer it.\n\nThing is, you never know what, how and where you're going to land, so even though you like (say) writing apps for your phone, and you have decided you're going to be a coder and make big apps/games, don't ignore that small habit of you catching flies, or drawing, or fishing, or stargazing, or playing chess, or making model towns with legos, doesn't matter how stupid it is, or you think it is, just keep it going.\n\nWhat I want to say is that, even though people say we should put all the focus on what we love, that's (imo) mostly a highly glorified statement. I say, you do what you love, but keep all the options ready. Who knows by the time you're 20, you might completely despise computers for some weird reason, and if you've given up on your rest of the habits/hobbies at 16, now at 20 you've nothing to show for. \n\nSee the world doesn't play by our rules, we make some plan, and by the time it's about to execute, the world turns up side down.\n\nTest it yourself, make a few plans for the weekend, and see how many of them goes exactly as you planned.\n\nThe plans we make for a weekend gets ruined, so how/why do we expect a plan we make for 5/7 yrs from now to go as planned.\n\nDo what you like, ofcourse. Focus all you want. But be smart, always keep your hobbies alive, atleast until you make one of them your primary source of income. Don't listen to those dumbass people saying \"money can't buy you happiness\" and shit. I say fuck em. First you make money and get rich then decide for yourself.\n\nYou've always heard a lot of winner's perspective by now I guess. I've given you a losers perspective. Things I should have done, things I should have avoided. Wish I could say these things to 16 yr old me! \n\nYou're young, have plenty of time, use it wisely.

            "He didn\u2019t just get mad about the diver team not wanting to use his robot sub\u2014he called the lead caver (who eventually orchestrated the rescue of all the kids) a pedophile out of nowhere. That was many people\u2019s first sign (including myself) of the raging narcissist and asshole hiding behind Elon\u2019s cultivated PR.\n\nI was one of the ones who idolized him, what\u2019s not to like: billionaire, sleeps with supermodels, seemingly out to make the world a better place with electric cars, solar energy and colonizing Mars. He always seemed like the smartest guy in the room, the real life Iron Man. He made the plans for EVs open source (rather than keep as private patents) ostensibly to allow the tech to proliferate faster, just seemed an all-around Great Man.\n\nAfter the seeming aberration of the twitter snit in 2018\u2026it was like the Elon facade broke and more and more kept coming to light (a lot of it from Elon himself) that made it seem Elon was not actually a good guy, just a guy with good PR who appeals to a certain segment of people regardless. His anti-union practices at Tesla while claiming he\u2019s for the workers made him a hypocrite (as did claiming to be all about \u201cfree speech\u201d but making Tesla workers sign NDAs so they can\u2019t criticize Tesla). Threatening a coup in Bolivia (\u201cWe will coup anyone we want. Deal with it.\u201d -Elon Musk) so he could mine lithium there. His petty attacks on people for even small criticisms, standing with Amber Heard in the Depp trial, his weird semi-support for Trump, joining Trump\u2019s economic council and saying he would reinstate Trump to Twitter. Putting microchips in monkey\u2019s brains that killed dozens of them\u2026it started to become clear Musk was less Iron Man and more \u201cBond Supervillian\u201d.\n\nFor me the breaking point was the pandemic. Musk loudly spreading misinformation (like graphs on how Covid would just disappear in a few months that turned out to be extremely wrong, or that masks don\u2019t work\u2014my wife is a respiratory therapist and masks work just fine) and raging against reasonable measures taken to stem the virus he just lost me. He has revealed himself as someone that thinks they are an expert in things they are not, first revealed in his petty lashing out that the Thai rescue team didn\u2019t see his dumb idea as brilliant, and continuing to when the epidemiologists who do this virus stuff for a living didn\u2019t want to listen to his idiot ideas about the pandemic.\n\nNow seeing him with clearer eyes, he seems exactly like what he is: a guy born on 3rd base from his parents emerald mines, who thinks he hit a triple with his self-made man nonsense, thinks he\u2019s always the smartest when there are very clear examples that he\u2019s not, and generally just the modern definition of a narcissist.\n\nEdit: I incorrectly referred to Thai Cave Rescuer Vernon Unsworth as \u201cdecorated Navy Seal\u201d, confusing him with the Seals who were involved with the rescue. Thanks to many who pointed out the inaccuracy.",
            "When people started paying attention to what he did rather than what he said.",
            "I was always skeptical, because I don\u2019t trust people who accumulate wealth the way he has.  But when I found out about his support for the coup in Bolivia so he could get his hands on their lithium deposits for cheap- that was when I knew he wasn\u2019t a good person.  I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s taken this long for everyone else.  Well, most everyone.  One of my coworkers still worships the ground he walks on because he\u2019s a champion of freedom of speech.  Yeah I\u2019m sure having one super rich guy in control of one of the largest social media platforms in the world and deciding what it\u2019s ok to say will be ~great~ for freedom of speech.\n\nEDIT: Several people have pointed out that the 2019 political crisis in Bolivia was not a coup.  The direct quote from Musk in question, however, does call it as such.",
            "When he started manipulating stocks via twitter is personally when I soured on him",
            "Around the time he tried to make a submarine to save kids as a PR stunt, then accused the man who did save them of being a pedophile. Once that happened people started talking about the fact that his wealth comes from his father's stolen emerald mine in South Africa, which enabled him to scam millions with PayPal before buying Tesla and demanding to be named founder of the company. \n\nAfter all that unraveled, people realized he either directly paid or flexed enough billionaire muscle to get The Simpsons to produce an entire episode praising him as the man who'll save the future. Don't forget the hair plugs, that picture started circulating again. He's just a really phony guy who's only personality trait is having money and wanting to be seen as Tony Stark. Oh wait, didn't he pay for a cameo in Iron Man 2 as a contemporary of Tony Stark's?\n\nThis is ignoring his gradual shift to right wing politics simply because it nets him immediate praise from a vocal group rather than take the chance at appealing to progressives, who are more critical of what you say. His attitude started to match that of a 15 year old boy who sees himself as Rick from Rick and Morty, that sort of mindset in a public figure who's total value exceeds most nations is incredibly dangerous. Musk has more money than all of North Korea, and he has his own space program. In his ideal libertarian world nothing would stop him from developing his own nuclear arsenal.\n\nPeople who continue to like him do so either from ignorance of what he really is or because they believe others like him, so he must be valuable. The crypto community only ever liked him because he was a billionaire who could tweet \"doge\" and their funny money suddenly has real world value. Then it became obvious he was manipulating the markets, because crypto is unregulated and therefore completely fair game.\n\nNobody becomes a billionaire off hard work, it takes a significant amount of exploitation of others to accumulate that sort of wealth.",
            "IMO he comes across pretty immature and a try hard and he\u2019s gotten even more attention that last few years. So he has reached more people which means more people annoyed by him. And then you have the people that hate any billionaire.",
            "Even before his weird tantrum over the Thailand situation, reports starting coming out about his anti-union, anti-workers rights attitudes and policies. That, I think, led to a deeper look beyond the \u201ccool\u201d tech stuff he does at who he is as a person. A guy who generally just attaches himself to existing ideas (PayPal, Tesla) and then takes credit for them. A guy whose initial wealth came from his family\u2019s atrocity-filled mining operations. A guy who cares nothing for his employees. A guy who talks a big talk but fails to deliver more often than not.",
            "EDIT: I misquoted a podcast on Musk I heard and that is my bad.\n\nWhat actually happened is Elon left SA to avoid conscription and benefitted from more lax US immigration policy at the time, he then went on to vote for much MUCH more restrictive immigration policy on the EIC, specifically immigration from countries involved in domestic strife or conflict. What I was remembering was that Musk helped place restrictions on the same immigration avenues that he used to get out of SA, not financial programs. This issue is more of a philosophical hypocrisy than an on-paper one and more of an opinionated (in my case) condemnation.\n I'll leave the original comment up for transparency but THE BELOW INFORMATION IS NOT COMPLETELY ACCURATE. \n\n\nA lot of great responses here but one I'm not seeing is Elon enjoyed quite a few benefits when he immigrated to the US from South Africa. I don't know the name of the program but something like grants or financial assistance for immigrants. \n\nAnd then, some years later, while serving on Trump's economic advisory council, he voted to dismantle those same programs either to tow trump's line or for his own reasons. \n\nEither way walking through an open door only to slam it shut behind you is a pretty shit-bad move imo.",
            "For me, it's how he shows his true colors and prioritizes profits over everything. For example, he talks about how Americans are lazy and \"avoid work at all costs\" while Chinese \"burn not only the midnight oil, but the 3 A.M. oil\". Like fuck you, man. I'm not sorry that I respect myself enough to not work my entire life away. Elon is fine with people literally sleeping in the Tesla factory. That's not a workforce homie, that's a fucking prison. He treats his income like it's irrelevant, asking Twitter if he should help solve world hunger or not, which to struggling me, is a slap in the face.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: I feel he's showing his true colors. He is not/was never about helping the world, and kind of got rich while doing it, everything he has done and every business he has started is all about furthering his already ridiculous net worth. When he talks about getting off fossil fuels, it's not because he cares about Climate Change and saving the planet and thereby humanity, no it's because that'll increase Tesla stock. Just my opinion, obviously.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: To further add to this, the recent Twitter deal is another fantastic example. He talks about how it's the 'Modern Public Square', and therefore deserving discussing any and all idea's and how Twitter shouldn't be for profit. Very noble of him. Exceeeppppttt, when getting the funding he needed to try and purchase Twitter, he outlined how he could increase it's profits, and Tesla employee's apparently have NDA's outlining that they're not allowed to discuss the company or disparage them in any way. So it looks like he cares about free speech only when it doesn't affect his bottom line or his companies that he's CEO of. Not very free all of a sudden. And now that Twitter stock has fallen, he **APPEARS** (I want to stress that bc it's very subjective and just my take) that he's looking to back out of the deal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit part 2: Electric Boogaloo: Cool!

            "He pays people to market his persona, and that works OK for a bit when people haven't been paying attention. But when your persona is actually just a self-important ego monster, the people who start paying attention notice. Then the marketing doesn't work so well because people have taken time to form an opinion.",
            "So Musk essentially is the product of his South African roots, the pseudo-libertarianism of the early tech industry, and the cult of celebrity we have in the US and the west. \n\nI have worked with and known South Africans for years. I am also from Alabama which has a lot in common with South Africa. There is in both societies a literal bunker mentality that views the \u201cother\u201d as a constant threat. It has lessened in Alabama since segregation in the 1960s, but it still informs much of the culture. It is a \u201cround up the wagons and arm yourself\u201d kind of approach to life. It also has an element of \u201cfuck all y\u2019all\u201d no shame allowed mentality. \n\nAlso, the earliest hacker and programmers were almost universally into the libertarian philosophy that merit made them who they are, ignoring that the Internet was a government sponsored invention and that you had to be fairly privileged to have access to a computer in the 1980s and early 1990s. I know this because I am a programmer of 25 years. He probably views his success as something he earned without anyone else\u2019s help or input. I think his focus on Mars habitation has a bit of the libertarian utopia dream the \u201cBioshock\u201d game. That mentality (in my observation) tends to promote a bit of an assholery that can\u2019t be hidden for long. \n\nFinally, both Musk and Trump love seeing their name in the news and having followers, etc. They will literally say or do anything to keep themselves in the public discussion. It is a sad type of addiction. \n\nThat being said, I agree with him that we need to develop towards space industries and we need electric vehicles. A lot of what he (and others) are doing to stoke their own egos will eventually help humanity as a whole. If we don\u2019t get off this planet for resources and to develop technology that lets us live with barebones resources that get reused, humanity will disappear. \n\nIf we get there due to a billionaire compensating for something, I am ok with that.",
            "Look, you can think that Musk and Bezos are geniuses. But they also feel that it is their right to do what they want on the backs of workers and it is acceptable for me to hate them for it.\n\nBoth were able to create something that changed the world.   Made them the richest people in the world. I have to admire that.   I can also hate them because they believe they are so important that workers should have been making Teslas during a pandemic, with little to no protections for their workers, and if they were worried about their health they can just find another job (lose everything as most people working there are living paycheck to paycheck.)\n\nOr it is rumored but is certainly an example that Bezos was upset that he couldn't put cameras in delivery trucks to make sure they were working as hard as possible.   Talk to an Amazon delivery driver, they already feel incredible pressure to do what they are expected to do.  But let's push them harder for $18 an hour.

So yeah, prices have definitely gone up.\n\nAnd it *is* still cheap, relatively speaking. It depends on what you get. My go-to meal is a Double cheeseburger with extra cheese, a small fry, and a large coke. They have a 2 for $3 thing that makes the burger and fries $3 total even though the fries are normally something over $2. They have a thing where any size soda is only $1. The extra cheese is an extra 50 cents, but even after tax its still under $5 for a burger, fries, and large drink. If Im  *really* hungry, an additional burger is only $1.50 more plus 50 cents for extra cheesse, so thats still less than $7 for a pretty big meal.\n\nOn the other hand, if you order the chicken nuggets or any of the specialty burgers, those are more expensive for the same amount of food. So yeah, depends what you order.\n\n\nEDIT: Because I keep getting comments telling me that I got the price of a Double Cheeseburger wrong, or that the price I listed is for the McDouble, not the Double Cheeseburger, I will politely remind everyone that prices can vary based on location. If you say that a Double Cheeseburger costs $x where you are or that $1.50 in your area only gets a McDouble, I believe you. But that doesnt mean that I was wrong about what burgers cost where ***I*** am. Please try to remember that your personal experience is not the *only* experience, and just because you have experienced X, does not mean that someone else is wrong when they say they have experienced Y.",

Our money is devalued and commodities are more expensive now. We're in a prolonged downturn that slowly creeps up on us.",
            "Part of the issue is that inflation doesn\u2019t fail to happen however wages fail to increase as consistently. So although I\u2019m sure most of you earn more now than you did when \u201cfast food was cheap\u201d, the fact that it seems over inflated means wages haven\u2019t been inflated proportionally (probably).

            "This is a product of what I like to call the profit imperative, evry single corporation on earth *must* make compounding profits year on year, so if maccas made a hundred dollars in profit this year they're expected to make at least a hundred and one dollars next year then one hundred and two etc etc.\n\nWhere this falls down though is exponential growth can not be sustained (basic thermodynamics) so they have to cut corners with ingrediants or serving size or price (but never board salaries mind.) This is why everything produced by a corporation now days is so incredibly terrible, it costs the earth but no longer contains barely any nutritional value or will break in short order etc.",
            "There's a bit of truth to what you're saying, because fast food has changed somewhat. If you look at the size of the menu at most fast food places, it's insanely huge compared to the original McDonalds menu, for example. That means more stuff to keep in stock in general, more complex logistics, etc. Originally, McDonalds kept their menu super, super slim because it was a cost-cutting measure. Now the strategy is, attract more customers to make more money instead of keep cost to the absolute lowest possible level. There's also more of a push for higher quality in fast food, for example the push to fresh beef from Wendy's and McDonalds. There are some costs associated with that.\n\nBut beyond that, there's the fact that for a lot of jobs, wages aren't keeping up with inflation. So you might work a job where the buying power of your wages has been eroded over the years.\n\nSo it's probably not actually any one thing, but the combination of a number of factors.",

Chipotle, noodles, panda, and Panera normalized the idea of a \u201cfast casual\u201d meal that you paid more for, and Americans were happy to pay it (I mean, I know I was. Huge difference in quality for not much more money.) Fast food chains have \u201crebranded\u201d (or are trying to) so they also can be in this higher price bracket.

            "Over the past decade, I noticed in Florida every time anyone in office breathed the words \"mininum wage increase\" fast food prices went up about 30 to 40 cents on the average price of a value meal.\n\nIt seems like fast food restaurants want everyone to believe that their cost of labor has skyrocketed, when they would have easily been offset by a very marginal increase of a few cents.\n\nYes, inflation has contributed but I also see it as them trying to squeeze their customers for every dime they are worth.\n\nWell jokes on them. Almost everyone I know has started ordering pickup from restaurants because the prices are about the same and the quality is higher.\n\nIf I'm going to pay 40 for four people to eat out, it's not going to be for a tasteless quarter pounder.\n\nThey have ramped their prices up so high that if they try to match the new increases that will take place through 2026 then it's just going to drive them out of business.\n\nI have no doubt that they'll try, but who is going to pay 60 for 4 \"value\" meals?\n\nEdit: a word",

For example; the last time I got a burrito from a food truck cost me $14... for one single regular burrito!! $14!!!!! That shit used to cost me like $6-8 MAX. Now it\u2019s double and they give you a drink for like $3 extra. Fucking rip off. And the taste isn\u2019t as good as regular restaurants either. \n\nI just feel like the food truck thing used to be something that wasn\u2019t seen in a positive light while growing up.

Owners of a shop pay a pretty big percentage of TURN OVER (not profit, very important) to the Franchiser for among other things branding, marketing, menu design, etc. Then they are forced to buy new decor regularly (A solo shop isn't going to cunt out $10k on a new awning ever year, where franchises are forced into similar situations often or else). \n\nWages have gone up lately, with the entire Cost To Company being increased drastically. Insurance has gone up during this time. Foot traffic is way down. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd, most importantly, and you really really really should remember this.... There stock prices do no fall. The profit does not fall. The amount that goes to the big ups is never allowed to go down, or they shut down the location and put in a different owner.

            "Kids would be less afraid of the dentist if parents took them to dedicated pediatric dentists early to avoid major problems.  Too often parent wait too long and then the first visit is fillings and painful cleanings.  Taking them often helps with the fear and makes the visits less painful.  Also, just a side note.  Not saying \u201cgod I hate the dentist\u201d in front of your kids helps to.  When both parents regularly go and don\u2019t show fear in going it helps the whole process.  I\u2019d like to add that sometimes kids are just gonna be scared.  But these things help a lot.",
            "My childhood dentist would cover my mouth and nose w his hand and say\"I'll let you breath when you stop crying/screaming\".  Hubby had the same dentist, he didn't suffocate him but did pull the wrong teeth.",
            "I don't think so. Sitting in a chair without any control over what's being done to you by a guy with noisy and sharp, scary looking tools is pretty bad on it's own.",
            "I watched those episodes as a kid and I have never been afraid of the dentist. This is despite being an incredibly anxious kid (and adult) who was scared of lots of other things. Unfortunately I don\u2019t think you can control or predict what will make kids scared that easily.",
            "Transmission of fear (I doubt that's the actual term) is a real thing, parents for example can give their fear to their children without the children ever being in that situation.",
            "In my experience it's a learned behavior, from interactions with the dentist. My youngest had to have thickened liquids for years when younger, which are known to pool and puddle on teeth and cause decay. You can't simply rinse the mouth and they cannot have thin liquids in their mouth because they aspirate them.\n\nHis slightly older big brother has had normal wear and tear on teeth.\n\nMy youngest hates the dentist, he's got six caps because of the decay from the thickeners. He won't even admit his teeth hurt ever for fear of having to go back to the dentist. \n\nSlightly older isn't afraid and always has good exams, did have one cavity that was taken care of without anesthetic as it was shallow. \n\nIf the dentist never hurts you its easy to laugh off those jokes on tv. If you've been hurt its easy to identify with them and feel validated.",
            "Those episodes are literally made to help kids get over said fear. That's *why* they exist.",
            "No, dentists are like the perfect storm of physical pain, emotional pain (guilt and shame), loud high pitched noises, intrusions on your personal space, and in some cases can be real expensive.",
            "Nope. I'm 16 and afraid of the dentist due to you being helpless while someone meddles in your mouth with sharp needles and tools while forcing teeth out",
            "What your asking about are the psychology concepts of modeling and priming.\n\nModeling is easy to understand, if one sees a person or character behave a certain way they are likely to repeat the behavior they've seen. \n\nPriming is learning to relate this to that. I'm primed to relate McDonalds, my fridge, and a noon call from my friend who always asks to go for lunch with eating. The show primes children that dentists are to be feared.\n\n\nTo be more effective the chrqcater should start with a positive experience,  they love going to the dentist. They are to be trusted. They encounter a character who knows nothing of a dentist, what do they do? Explain their work, again in a positive  tone and they have the conflict come from an outside source.\n\nThe Corns, Canes and Beet sugar company plans to sell sugar that looks like vegetables to addict kids to low nutrient foods! No! The dentist explains how sugar promoter the growth of bacteria who excrete waste into your mouth! Yuck! Together the heroes and dentist stop this plan.\n\n\nA much better way to teach kids about dentists, probably not a great episode.",
            "I was strapped to a wall, verbally and physically abused by a dentist as a child. I too this day won't let anyone near my mouth.",
            "In my experience, no. I had a lot of overcrowding as a kind and ended up having several teeth pulled over a few visits. My fear stemed from that repeated experience and had nothing to do with tv or other media. I would guess lots of other kids have physically painful (or at least physically uncomfortable) experiences which add to the general unease and lack of control mentioned in other comments.",
            "I don't think it's because of the episodes, I feared the dentist only in the waiting room when I heard the noises. But I think parents should paint a better picture about them and instead of making kids fear them they should explain that they are helping you and will make things better. That's what my parents did and it helped me.",
            "Yes. I'm not sure it would be a huge difference, but it would probably help. Similarly, I don't think so many people would be bad at math if it weren't so common in media to treat math class as hell.",
            "I'm terrified of any dental work. Periodt. \n\nI was fine when I was younger bc stickers and prizes. In high school, I went through two different surgeries to fix things in my mouth that I was awake for (obviously local anasthetic) and I spent 6 years in braces, expanders, and temporary bridges before implants. I have extremely sensitive teeth and I started grinding in my sleep in college so they always hurt and almost always bleed (despite brushing & flossing). The last couple of years I go every six months and have been using sensitive toothpaste and a night guard, but I still have to take an anti anxiety before going. And typically the stress of an appointment makes me exhausted the rest of the day.",
            "I don't think so! That type of episodes came into picture after having the incidents and cases of children being scared of them!  The real incidents influenced that type of episodes and not vice versa.",
            "Yes, and we wouldn\u2019t keep having to have uncomfortable \u201cis Santa real\u201d conversations if every holiday program didn\u2019t bring it up at least once.",
            "I used to work in pediatric dentistry and in my experience, the majority seems to come from parents transferring their own fear to their children. Those kids usually did fine once we removed the parent from sight and mind. \n\nThen there's the kids who have had a bad experience before (either medical or dental). There was a shitty clinic in our area that referred patients to us who they had already traumatized. We called those kids \"victims of [clinic name]\". They'll probably have dental phobias for life. So it comes from a variety of sources, but I would say that while TV likely plays a role, I'd estimate it's a fairly small one.",
            "My dentist was pulling a tooth and it slipped and he dropped it in my throat. I started gagging and coughed it back up and it hit him in the face. He then yelled at me for spitting a tooth at him :/\nI was like 8 or 9.",
            "I honestly don\u2019t think television influence has anything to do with it. I think it has to do more with the fact that a dental exam to a child could perceivably come across as an alien abduction/experimentation type of experience.",
            "And if parents didn't extol all the horrors of dentistry for them to hear.  I'm a dental professional, and this is the #1 issue I see.\nYou be cool, your kids will be cool.",
            "Teach kids to care for their teeth, so going to the dentist is not associated with \"pain\". My kids never get scared going to the dentist, even after they got their teeth pulled out a few times.",
            "Cartoons never put fear of them. I dont mind going to the dentist now but I used to hate the feeling of the vibration on the drill on my teeth.",
            "I watched those things I was never scared of the dentist, I assumed they knew what they were doing",
            "My wife starter prepping our firstborn like a month before going to the dentist. \nJust by calmly explaining what was going to happen over and over. And we had a kids book about a dragon (swedish kids show on tv) going to the dentist as well. He was super cool and almost excited to go. I strongly believe it's all because she prepared him. Like if we whould have just told him now we are going to the dentist, or tomorrow we are going to the dentist without giving him alot of time to prepare he whould have been scared and not have a good experience. \nIn Sweden all kids go when they are 1 year old and then again when they are 3. The prepping started before the second time.",
            "This is why rugrats needs a comeback! It taught kids to not be afraid of this kind of stuff, also including getting shots. Definitely had some of the best morals in hindsight",
            "I personally think kids would be less scared of the dentist if they flossed regularly. Maybe a kids tv show could show that.",
            "I always looked forward to the dentist as a kid, my mum would always make it positive in some way. If the dentist said my teeth were healthy and I was taking good care of them she would take us to this little bakery and cafe next door and treat us to whatever we wanted. In the event of a filling or tooth removal I would be rewarded with a day off school where I was allowed to watch tv and play PlayStation.(I wasn't allowed to do this on a usual sick day).",
            "I wasn't until I had a shitty dentist who said to tell him if it hurt. I did and he ignored me. A very detailed memory, it was in a low income neighborhood I grew up in. After three attempts of getting his attention, when he turned for the next tool he needed I noped up and walked out. Following my mother took me to a specialist. (I smahsed my mouth into the side of a 4ft swimming pool when playing football in a backyard, destroying my top 4 center teeth and chipping the bottom 2.) She was so much different, using numbing creams prior to novocaine to ease the injection discomfort and explained each process before starting the procedures. Much different experience.\n\nEdit - I was age 11",

            "Seinfeld?",
            "I can't relate. My mom worked in a dentists office and I loved being there. I'd spend my summer making charts and when I was at the age of losing teeth I wanted the dentist to pull them instead of wiggling them out on my own. I voluntarily had at least 6 teeth pulled that I can recall.",
            "Im scared if the dentists bc i had very bad experiences as a child with a bad kid dentist. They were very mean, and also gave me my little sisters fillings(she had more cavities than me and they just thought since i was older, that it was mine) every dentist ive been after that has been hit or miss, but im scared every time",
            "All of these episodes are based around the dentist being nothing to be afraid of",
            "My dentist had an N64 in the lobby, so I always looked forward to the dentist",
            "I have had somewhere around 15-20 cavities in my life. I got head gear in 5th grade for an overbite. I got braces in 7th grade. I went to a periodontist twice to graft a receding gum line. I now wear a mouthguard every night for grinding my teeth.\n\nBy all accounts, I should be absolutely horrified of the dentist, and to my knowledge, I never was.",
            "I loved the dentist. She was a very nice woman and my parents always made it a point that it wasn't a big deal. They would then take me to get ice cream, so I always had a positive association to it. It's definitely part of how the parents handle it.\n\nEdit: My parents also took really good care of my teeth. So I never went in for more than a regular cleanup.",
            "I think SOME children would be less scared of dentists because many young children like to imitate things from those shows. Some, but not all, depending on the maturity of the child. However, I was just to the dentist and saw a boy who looked about six and was completely confident about going to the dentist.",
            "I think it's more the parents' attitude to it as well as the experience at the dentist's office.\n\nThe country I live in has a dental program for all kids with periodic appointments to introduce them to the process. The first visit they sit in the chair on a parent's lap and the dentist gets a quick history. If they are willing to open their mouth when asked they might check but only with a finger; no tools. The second visit is kind of the same, mainly to catch the kids that didn't want to open their mouths the first time and to check for tooth misalignment from pacifiers. My son has been to his third appointment now (he's four) and this was te first time there were any dental tools used.\n\nNeither of my kids are afraid of the dentist, and the lady who we've had is really good with kids and keeps them engaged and positive.\n\nPersonally, I had cool dentists up until I was an adult. Even when I chipped my front tooth when I was ten, my dentist was friendly and didn't talk over me to the other adults. My dad also didn't make a big scary deal of going to the dentist.\n\nI'm sure some kids will pick up on the 'dentists are scary' trope and get some apprehension about it, but like with much of what they take in independently this is then metered against comparative experience through their trusted role models.",
            "Dentistry has changed for the better. Equipment and methods have improved.  Also people are more educated about hygiene and routine care so dentistry can be more preventive in nature which is less invasive and easier.  Pediatricians and dentists recommend oral exams for toddlers now which makes going to the dentist just a routine part of healthcare instead of a painful toothache 1st experienced when a child is old enough to remember.",
            "... Am I the only one who had no problem with the dentist?",
            "Parents attitudes about it hugely effect kids attitudes. Additionally, making sure your kids know what to expect. \n\nMy children LOVE going to the dentist. They ask me to go constantly. It helps that it\u2019s a fun pediatric dentist.",
            "I understand not wanting to have fillings, being scared of the needle in the mouth is pretty normal I think. But a regular check up? Yeah it's a bit awkward and uncomfortable but it's not painful. I'm not sure what there is to be scared of.",
            "I always enjoyed the dentist as a kid and even now-",
            "My mum is a dentist so I'm not afraid of them at all. In fact I can sometimes take a little nap while she's busy",
            "I don't think so. Those episodes sort of create an emotional relevance to kids. It allows them to not feel so alone when it comes to that fear, because their initial experiences with the dentist are essentially on their own, with no other kids around them to share the experience.",
            "I don't think so.\n\nI was never afraid of the dentist. My sister on the other hand was always crying in that chair. \n\nI honestly think it depends on the kid. I can't say that dentists are not scary to kids, there's so much foreign, scary looking stuff there. Thr noise is worse, even as an adult, I think the noises can make you super uncomfortable.",
            "I was never afraid of the dentist as a child. Though, if all my favorite childhood shows had a lead character that was afraid of the dentist, I probably would have developed a fear of dentists also. \n\nDon't introduce new fears to your kid, even if the message is to not be afraid of that thing.",
            "Probably not.It like being afraid of the dark, it just happens and you have no control of whats going and you're scared.",
            "No because lots of kids naturally think haircuts hurt and I think it is the same idea",
            "I\u2018m not actually afraid of the dentist since I\u2018ve never have a cavity. Though I dread the day I get one because everyone always talks about how painful it is. I just hope I\u2018m so old my teeth have fallen out by then and I can just go to dentures. I did have a baby tooth pulled though which wasn\u2018t too as it was all numb and my wisdom teeth which was a bit scarier and hurt longer but was also okay with painkillers. Worst part was my stitches breaking the second I got home and having to get them again on one side. I\u2018ve also had braces which was very painful but it wasn\u2018t a regular dentist so I don\u2018t associate it with them. Oh also had a super painful teeth cleaning and got scared of getting them but then had two great non painful ones at my new dentist so I\u2018m over it.",
            "Don't those episodes normally end with the lesson of \"see, there was actually nothing to be afraid of\"?",
            "Can we counter this by showing the kids their own parents getting the work done calmly and then do more \u201ccomfy\u201d and less time restraints so if the kid feels like taking a walk ext. then it\u2019s not so \u201cI\u2019m stuck and scared?\u201d",
            "I\u2019ve also wondered this about school. In general, I liked school. I enjoyed learning. But I felt self-conscious about liking it. Largely, I think, because of cartoons and kids shows.  Were there things I didn\u2019t like about it? You bet. Especially as I got a bit older. And of course it also depended on the teacher.  But I also felt like kids weren\u2019t supposed to like it. That through TV the it was drilled into us that the default mode was to hate school, and it had to prove itself to be good/enjoyable. That is much tougher than starting from a neutral/positive standpoint. \n\nI should also point out that I went to Catholic school up through fourth grade (9 years old). Not being a public school, I think our school day was a little shorter than public schools in the 90s. It\u2019s also possible our recess was longer than public school, but that I don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t remember how much homework we had, but I do think we had less \u201cprojects\u201d than my 5th grade class in public school.  These things could of course contribute to my overall sense of school.",

The dentist is like any other \u201chero\u201d\u2014 police, firefighter, doctor, etc\u2014 in her mind because he plays a role in keeping her healthy and strong by fighting the sugar bugs.

            "No. Those \"afraid of the dentist\" episodes exist because the dentist is an inherently frightening experience, not the other way around. Same with every other \"afraid of the doctor\" episode. It is against our animal instinct to allow a stranger, near-stranger, non-friend, etc to probe our wounds or insert things in our orifices. This is why pedophiles often groom children before acting and why we we are taught not to let people touch us EXCEPT for doctors and dentists. Most animals try to bite when you shove your fingers in their mouth, and this is what children do instinctively unless they are conditioned not to. Self-defense is part of why animals have teeth.",

            "Here in Sweden, they have an amazing approach to kids and dentists. They don\u2019t just force kids to do it like most other countries do. \nThey do it slowly and gradually. Like the first meeting, for example, is just to show the kid the dentist tools and answer questions. \nThen the next one is just to look inside his mouth etc etc. \nEverything is done in a very respectful manner to the fact that it\u2019s a child and that it can leave a trauma if it\u2019s a painful and unpleasant experience. \nWe can only hope that other countries will follow suit and adopt the same kind of standards.",

            "I think this is an excellent question, I too have wondered this about a number of things.  I find most teens to be pleasant for example but teen shows always show surly and rude teens which makes me think it builds a sort of expectation for this behaviour.\n\nI am in my 40s but our family has had the same dentist since I was 5 years old.  He is VERY respected and a lovely man.  I had a troublesome tooth that needed pulling so he looked in my mouth to see which one it was, he touched a few of my teeth, \"is it this one or this one?\" he asked me.  When I said which one it was he said  \"Oh dear, it's very firm\" he said.  He lined up a number of tools on a tray, pincers, a large needle and other scary looking instruments then he said.  Right which should I use.  I was about 7 and very frightened. \"n-n-none of them\" I said on the verge of tears.  \"Okay then I won't\" he said and handed me my tooth which he had already pulled out while he was poking around in my mouth, he'd basically distracted me by asking me which one he did but he liked to play a little joke with the instruments.  He did the same to my sister a few years later but asked her how school was.\n\nI never knew people were afraid of the dentist until I saw it on TV so I think you have a really good point.",

            "I'm an adult in my forties and I'm still afraid of the dentist, so much so that the last time I saw one I panicked and threw up on him. It had nothing to do with the fear of pain, but rather the way my (admittedly terrible) dentist treated me, like everything I did wrong or didn't do well enough or often enough was a shameful personal failing. Going to the dentist made me feel guilty and bad, and I would far rather be physically hurt than made to feel that way.\n\nOf course now, as an adult, I've gone so long without seeing a dentist that I'm terrified of the expense. I KNOW my teeth are in bad shape, but it's not like I can afford to have anything done about it, especially since my phobia means I'd probably need to be sedated in order for anything to even be done in the first place. So now I have two fears compounding each other: one, that I'll be made to feel EVEN WORSE for how long I've gone without, and two, that the expense would make treatment infeasible.\n\nSo in my case I think I would've been less scared of the dentist as a child if my dentist hadn't been a complete and utter asshole.",

Mom made sure Dad ate his veggies with a smile, so learned that veggies were good. The idea that there were people who *didn't* like peas and broccoli was foreign to us.\n\nIf the kid already hates or fears something, I can see those books, shows and episodes being positive.

I wasn't ever scared of the dentist, just annoyed I had to sit there while some dude shoved a finger in my mouth, so it was interesting when I saw a kid's show as a teen depicting this fear of dentists.

That was 22 years ago, and after the braces were removed I can count on one hand how often I've been back, literally 3 times. I have an appointment at the end of the month as my wisdom tooth broken, and I am a mess of nerves and anxiety.\n\nI desperately make sure my kids don't develop the same terror as me, and that dentists will be a good experience.

When he starts showing that he's afraid of something or displaying a bad behavior, we can watch a tv episode about confronting it.  Until then, I don't want the idea in his head that it's even a possible way to behave.",

Worst teeth you can imagine, gets panic attacks when he tried to go to a dentist. Yet he made me and my siblings go.  \n\n\nSo to summarize; I think children would lose the fear of the dentist if they had good parents who sit by them, dont make a big deal out of it and casually explain what the doctor is good for and what he does.

        "selftext": "To explain the backstory of this, I have to go back a bit.\nWhen I was a young boy, the first time I met a pregnant women was at the business place of my father. We had a little party that day, and I remember when she entered the room there was a very strong (and unpleasant) smell. Me being a kid and meeting a pregnant woman for the first time, I assumed either that's just the way they smelt, or it was a coincidence. \n    \nAs I grew up I met very few pregnant woman face to face, I had a very isolated childhood, but I did notice that smell only appeared when I was in a crowded place, and frequently I would be able to spot a pregnant woman somewhere in the crowd, or a woman with a baby. \n\nI always assumed that the reason nobody mentioned it was because it would be rude, but as I've gotten older I realize that I have never in my life heard anyone mention it. Not even an acknowledgment of the smell. This is strange to me considering it is a VERY strong smell. Virtually any room with a pregnant woman in it has smelt like that throughout, and considering its kind of a gross smell, I can't imagine EVERYONE staying silent about it.\n\nI brought it up to some friends recently, and they had no idea what I was talking about. This prompted me to Google it, I found nothing regarding this, many articles spoke of increased B.O but this smell is completely unique, not like B.O. \n\nI justified it as a coincidence until just a few days ago, I was in a Starbucks staring out the window, waiting for my drink. When I smelt the smell, I turned around and in the doorway was a pregnant woman. This confirmed it for me, I now have no uncertainty that all pregnant women smell like this. But NOBODY I've spoken to can relate.\n\nI come to you Reddit, please tell me that my super power isn't to smell when someone is pregnant. Everybody's just being polite right?",

I just somehow KNOW either of a woman is menstruating or if they're about to start within 5 days.  Mostly I have to have been around them for a few months or know them kinda well and I have to think about it to do it.  Like.....I have to sit there and \"listen\" to what I'm telling myself.  I dont know, that's the only way I can explain it.  And the thing is, I'm always right.  I did it to my girlfriend last week. I told her she would start in 3 days and that if we wanted to have sex, wed better start gettin it in now. (Yes.  I'm always this romantic) anyway, 3 days later she started.  \n\nMaybe it's some caveman thing.

            "There are many unique minor abilities that only certain humans have that have been documented, including those of smell. When a woman is pregnant her hormonal balances shift slightly, and a very small percentage of people have a rare olfactory ability to sense that. Similar to how some dogs are able to sense changes in a human biology, such as literally smelling cancer and certain diseases or pregnancy, or how some dogs are so sensitive to biological changes they are trained as Service Animals when they sense a seizure or some other medical condition. Many animals can sense an earthquake coming long before people.\n\nWith humans, there is a rare genetic quirk that allows a person to smell if another person was killed by cyanide. Very few people have it, but if a person is killed with cyanide, their breath smells of almonds, but only someone with this genetic quirk can smell it. I got this from the CSI episode The Book of Shadows, and upon checking, this is true. In fact, if you possess the rare genetic quirk and are trying to get a job in a crime lab or similar medical field, put it on your resume, you will definitely get hired.\n\nAnother interesting detail is if many women smell their male partner's sweaty laundry, most of the time that means it stinks.

            "I mean, we haven't really. If you're in my contact list, I'll answer when you call. We've just normalized not answering unknown numbers which is the ideal outcome for me tbh. When we had a landline in the late 90s/early 2000's we still got spam calls, we just had to answer them and tell them to fuck off because we didn't have caller ID. Now it's just become so uncommon to receive important calls from unknown numbers that we don't bother anymore because almost nothing is done over the phone. It's pretty great tbh.",
            "This is one of the main reasons I silence unknown callers and only put their call through if they call twice. I get at least 1-2 a day. It\u2019s ridiculous",

            "I still answer my phone, but I work at a call center and call references for employment purposes and people won\u2019t answer and will call back once they get the voicemail like \u201coh I thought this was spam\u201d most of the time",
            "I always answer in the hope that it's the call saying I've won the competition I entered via text. It never is. But I have learnt from answering that I've commited tax fraud and had an accident in the last 3 years so I guess all is not lost.",

Over the years, the USPS has become reliant on them. Other companies rely on obscuring call numbers and using cold calling. Many millions of dollars are made using outbound marketing. \n\nBasically, we've been sold out, time and time again. It won't stop unless we demand that it does.",
