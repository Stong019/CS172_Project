            "Can we give an actual answer to this question?\n\nYou asked about if there are ***legal restrictions*** stopping you from writing 'The Bible 2' and selling it?\n\nThe answer is no (probably)\n\nThe text of the Bible is entirely Public Domain, because it was written long, long before the invention of modern intellectual property laws. This means that anyone can use, adapt, remix or republish the text, including for commercial use, even without attribution.\n\nThat being said, many popular modern translations of the Bible are copyrighted, so if in your sequel, you're quoting very heavily from the Bible and incorporating someone else's translation works into your own text without permission, you might potentially be violating their copyright. This would enter a very touchy area of 'fair use' that isn't entirely settled. Of course, you could avoid the matter altogether by choosing one of many public domain translations.\n\nOne other note, I've written my answer assuming you live in a country without blasphemy laws. If you don't, you may have other issues that pertain directly to these laws. And some countries that might surprise you still enforce blasphemy laws (for example, Spain and Finland, both of which have enforced their blasphemy laws within the last 10 years). The US does not have blasphemy laws.",
            "The Bible is considered to be public domain, so you can do whatever you would like to it. The only copyright restrictions might be if you reprint a publisher's unique modern translation.

You will often have to start in a sorting facility and work your way up sorting and then packing trucks. It may take 5 years before a driver spot opens up. However drivers in higher cost of living areas can make 75-100K per year. Thanks to Unions (specifically the Teamsters) being a delivery driver is a solid middle class life.  \n\n\nThere are future problems with pension fund solvency and sustainability long term for union employees (but not for UPS I don't think as I believe it's a single employer pension) but that's something all unionized people have to worry about (I'm a Union Steamfitter).

Requirements for drivers will be higher since most of their job are done by robots. But autonomous cars also should be managed or analyzed by someone who will sit in the cars/trucks. And if you will have technical knowledge, your chances for getting a decent job with good work conditions and good payment will increase. These technical knowledge can be acquired for free (or much lower cost) on open source platforms. \nI think the least thing that someone would want is to be unemployed or having financial problems because of low salaries (which is caused because of few demand on workers).",

            "There is nothing sad about wanting to be happy. I used to make a lot more money when I worked on computers. But I hated it for the exact same reasons you mentioned in your post. Stuck at a desk, always inside doing monotonous work each day, same problems over and over again.  So I switched career fields. I applied for a job that required nothing but a high school diploma. And I was happy. I spent all that time in college pursuing a degree I dont even use. That doesn\u2019t make it worthless, because a lot of higher education is much more than just learning to do a skill. But, it isn\u2019t always immediately job applicable. Now trust me when I say there are things about my new career field that drive me nuts also. Just not the same things. \n\nDelivery driving is still honest work. And some people just love doing simple honest work. Fresh air, Exercise, making people happy. It\u2019s got a lot of perks to it that you don\u2019t always find at other jobs. As a society we seem to place so much emphasis on jobs requiring higher education being more valuable careers. When it absolutely isn\u2019t the case. My neighbor works for the garbage company. He lives in my neighborhood, he\u2019s doing well for himself, he goes to work happy, he comes home happy, he\u2019s able to afford a good lifestyle and provide for his family. If you ask me The guy has it made. But he didn\u2019t need a college degree to do what he does. And for anyone who thinks higher education jobs are so much more important, just wait until the trash stops getting collected for a few weeks. You will quickly learn how the entire city will shut down and people will beg garbage men and women to come back. \n\nOne thing this whole pandemic absolutely should have taught everyone is that ALL JOBS ARE ESSENTIAL. It takes everyone to keep this ship moving forward. I still don\u2019t understand why nobody sees that.",

I personally dispatched drivers with college degrees up to Masters of Science who had left their old careers to drive.  The people who could adapt to the lifestyle were often quite satisfied.  They rarely had to worry about their work outside of business hours.  We were a union shop and had plenty of people work their entire life there and retire comfortably, though I can't guarantee that will be the case 30 years from now.\n\nOne word of precaution, if you're a delivery driver you will have to interact with a lot of people, often strangers, on a daily basis.  I had friend that did short haul gravel deliveries, much less human interaction, fewer stops, but still got to enjoy the open road.\n\nAside from the day-to-day drama that comes with any job the drivers seemed satisfied and financially stable and had a good work-life balance.\n\nHope this helps.",

Since high school I've done food service/retail (everything from hostess to bakery), professional animal care was my jam for the past few years. \n\nMy oldest sister  (7 years older) is up to a handful of degress. She's got her majors (Graphic Design, Marketing and Advertising) and a couple language minors (Japanese Major and either German or Russian Minor, I think she's up to being conversational in something like 6-8 languages?). She was always \"The Smart One\".\n\nMiddle sister (2 years older) dropped out of high school her junior year, started studying fashion, and has done multiple gigs designing, making and modeling different styles and taking trade programs  (Welding, Locksmithing, something involving something like Blacksmithing, etc). \n\nI really felt food service was always love/hate. I started baking and cooking when mom got cancer for the first time when I was 7. I recovered from an eating disorder nearly a decade ago, but I love creating stuff and being able to see people enjoying said stuff. That satisfaction of \"shit yeah, I made good stuff, people enjoy it\" was a big push for skill/trade and service jobs. I wound up going through some stuff (learn the warning signs of abusive partners, yall!) and realized I was having a lot of difficulty just dealing with interacting with people and remaining professional. \n\nOne night I hung out with oldest sister and was trying to explain how I felt as I played with her dog. She was quiet for a bit and finally said \"I wonder if it's not 'service' you need to necessarily quit... What if you just need to stop serving the *human* customers?\" I always knew she was insanely smart but at that moment I realized she's a fucking genius. I was burnt out on ***humans***, not ***service***! I signed up with Wag and Rover, asked family (mom, extended family that I'd sat for) to write about their experiences of me caring for and enriching their pets lives.\n\n For the first time in my life I made my own schedule and it was all hanging out with animals. I was in heaven. The pay for my area was actually really good, normally like $75-100 a day, considerably more money than before and pretty much none of it felt like work. I think I was doing that for either 2-3 years.\n\nDue to unforseen circumstances I became disabled in 2019 and have difficulty with day to day stuff (amnesiac since mid-2019 whose brain wipes in REM sleep!) and I'm still trying to get disability settled.

            "In the schools I've both attended as a student and worked at, yeah. It's usually brief, but they usually address the school and then hand it over to the morning announcements students.",
            "Usually at least once a day, yes. Announcements, congratulations for sports teams, stuff like that. In my school the principal never called out an individual student or a group of students to come to their office.",

It was terribly bad but so much fun to watch and of course everyone sang along",
            "Sometimes.\n\nIn middle school (6-8 grade) we had daily announcements by the principal or vice principal. \n\nIn high school, usually the teacher read the normal stuff, and the deans or principal would just make more urgent announcements.  Like the time we had a student die to announce there was counseling available in the library.  Or the time that we had cops everywhere because one of the students got a death threat.",
            "[deleted]",
            "Yes, very much. In every school I\u2019ve been to (in Missouri), we had to stand up and recite the pledge of allegiance while a school official read it over the intercom every single morning before the morning announcments. There would also be announcements throughout the day, especially on days with different schedules and we even had end of the day announcements at my elementary and middle schools.",
            "As someone who attended high school both in Scandinavia and America, I feel like I can answer this and provide some context.\n\nThe short answer is yes. Here's why:\n\nUnlike many European education systems, American high schools are the central focus of a teenagers life. In Sweden, sports, clubs, dance, choir groups, theater, and all other things like it were mostly done as part of clubs or separate youth programs in your local area. In America, those things are all a part of high school. You want to play soccer? Better hope you make the high school team. You want to perform on stage? Better go audition for the schools Play Productions company. You want to swim, or play hockey, or do ballet? Speak to the coach/teacher and get enrolled. Even things like chess or astronomy club is lumped into high school. On top of that, all of these sports/arts/clubs are run by teachers that double as coaches.\n\nSo, every morning the principal or a designated student body officer will get on the intercom and read announcements to the entire student body. These announcements can contain:\n\n\\- Important dates for college admissions tests\n\n\\- Date/Time for sports matches\n\n\\- General announcements like reminders for days off or lost and found items\n\n\\- Club events like Chess, Astronomy, Spanish Club, FMLA, etc.\n\n\\- Dance announcements for things like Prom, MORP, Senior Cotillion, etc (these are all dance names)\n\n\\- Congratulations being offered to teams/clubs that did well. For example, if a school's football team made the state playoffs, that would be announced and cheered.\n\n\\- Announcements for assemblies which are when the entire student body comes together for various reasons.\n\n\\- Announcements for charity events run by the school.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinally, another important note is that American high schools are often huge! My high school had around 3000 students in it. Try getting information to all of the students at once without an intercom. Good luck with that!",

            "I\u2019m in Canada and we always did morning announcements over the intercom every single day my entire school career (K-12). They started each day with the national anthem and then moved on to daily announcements / happy birthdays to any kids with birthdays that day. In elementary (K-5) they\u2019d also play one classical song at the end before class started. In high school (9-12) the student council did video announcements every morning instead which was pretty fun. The speakers were also used to page individual classrooms say if a parent came to pick up a student in the middle of class for an appointment or something like that.",
            "They didn't happen in class at my school like that, it would be when most people have gotten there in the halls like 5 min before class starts we'd get brief updates and like lunch specials, then my second school (a smaller one) didn't do them at all",

            "yes",

            "Yes, how often depends on the school though. In a smaller town where I went, we would have morning announcements and dismissal. If someone needed to be called to the principal's office it would be through the intercom in that class only during transition/lunch it would be through the intercom for the whole school. We also had students who would run tasks for the office so they would come into the class with a note from the office. In a larger school, we had videos that were recorded for morning announcements that we would watch and I rarely recall the principal using the intercom for announcements. Same system with students delivering notes as needed.",
            "Yep, it\u2019s always pretty embarrassing when you get called out too. One time a bunch of kids smoked weed in the bathroom so the principal brought up the cameras outside of the bathroom to see who all walked in and called them all individually to the office via the intercom. Also when your name gets called be prepared for the class to collectively say \u201coooooh he\u2019s in trouble\u201d.",

            "My school stopped doing the pledge and didn't have announcements every morning once we were in high school. Teachers were told our freshman year that all their classes had to be taught at the same speed so all their classes where learning the same thing on the same day. So each english class was doing the same chapter regardless of the teacher or the time. Teachers said the pledge and morning announcements messed up first period timing so they had to leave 8 min of doing nothing at the begining or ending of the class to make it even. Then the administration freeked out that 35 to 40 min was being wasted every day, so they canceled anouncments. Then 6 weeks later teachers were all off schedule  because of sick days, Student questions and students needed more or less time to understand things. So the administration gave up, and they never did announcements.",

We also had more than one principal. So it wouldn't have made sense to do announcements.\n\nETA: We did have daily announcements, but they were the students on a TV variety that you sometimes see on TV. I think high school musical has it. Students recorded the announcements at the beginning of the day and they were played at lunch and in the halls between classes on screens. The principal never made an appearance. I don't know if I would have recognized my school principal.",

            "Yep. He always had some *words of wisdom* or something like that. We also had student council students making announcements in the morning.\n\nIf students needed to come to the office for anything we had a main secretary, who everyone was on a first-name basis with, and she called us to the office in the morning, in between class periods, before lunch and right before the end of the school day.",

            "We had loudspeaker announcements every day, and if an administrator had to contact a teacher, they could \"buzz in\" to their room to say whatever they needed to say. They even used the fucking loudspeaker to tell teachers to check their email and read it to the class when my friend died. That's how they decided to tell us.

Tickets can be purchased in the cafeteria during lunch hour for $5 or $7 at the door before the game\". Then during the day you generally get 2 or 3 brief things.

            "Yes.  Not just in the morning, either.  They'll often interrupt class to tell kids what they already know, typically with some feel-good motivational bullshit mixed in.",
            "We had morning announcements every day. The were about club meeting changes, rehearsals for theatre, that sort of thing. I learned that it's a bad thing to submit fake messages for announcements; you win a meeting with the assistant principal and a dressing down.",

Every school I've been to had intercoms in every classroom, which they used for the morning announcements/national anthem, as well as any announcements needed to be made throughout the day. However, one school in particular seemed to have a 2 way system. No idea if it was common or not, but I recall one day in elementary when the intercom said something (I think just telling our teacher there was something for her in the office or something) and instead of going out, she just yelled something back at the speaker and the office lady actually responded and we all flipped out cuz we had no idea those has microphones.",
            "In the schools I attended it usually was the assistant principal unless it was something important",
            "It isn't always the principal, but announcements are a daily thing. The school office also uses the PA system to call individual students to the office for appointments.  When my wife taught parochial school, the principal was a nun who liked to eavesdrop on the classrooms. The PA speaker caould also be used as a microphone. She could hear a click when the switch was changed to listen mode. She would say \"Attention students, please be quiet for an announcement from the principal.\" The principal eventually figured out what  was happening and was not amused.",
            "1 school I went to growing up actually had a morning news broadcast. 2 students would talk about everything going on in the school/events coming up that would be broadcasted to all TVs in school.\n\nAll my other highschools I went to,3 others, the principal only used the speakers for asking for students to come to the office.",

On rare occasions special announcements might be made during the day but they were usually reserved for unexpected or highly important information.",

            "(lifelong-US person, ~50 years old) When I was younger (up to 12 yrs) the schools had announcements every morning. The school had maybe 150 students total, in six grade levels. At the start of every school day the pledge of allegiance was said over the intercom and all the classrooms followed along, and any school-wide announcements were said after that. The intercom system did have \"2-way speakers\" in that if the administrative office wanted to, they could converse with the teacher or others in a single classroom. It wasn't used much however.\n\nIn later schools there was a intercom system that fed into all the classrooms, but it was rarely used. Also we didn't say the pledge every day either. \n\n,,,,\n\nAlso note: I lived in a middle-class/medium sized town with reasonable crime rates.... The high school (ages 13-17) I went to had 2200 students, and maybe five security guards total, and there was usually no police present at all.\n\nAt one point in my adult years I visited a public school in a high-crime area of a big city (north St Louis! I'm not sure what school). That place looked like a prison, with inside fencing and security doors and guard stations at the ends of every hallway. And there was speakers and cameras all over the place. When the school let out at the end of the day, there was at least a dozen police cars around outside, with real-actual-police standing around, just to try to prevent the kids from fighting. The police had a room as an office inside the school just for their own use, because they were there so often (to arrest students). There was a day-care center for students who had infant children and who couldn't get any other child care. It was a *radically* different version of \"normal\".\n\nWhen I was younger I saw depictions of (US) schools like this on TV and in mivies, and I never thought much about it since all the schools I went to were nothing like that. They really do exist however, in bad areas.",

I recently graduated high school in Texas and every morning, for 12 years, the principal would come over the intercom, force us to say both the US and Texas pledges, and then stand for a moment of silence. We would then get a daily briefing on what was going on around the school that day/week, updates about fundraisers we were forced to participate in (yes, I attended public school), any updates on sports/ club meetings, and then the creepiest line once I got to high school: \u201cMake it a great day or not, the choice is yours.\u201d Fucks sake that guy couldn\u2019t tell us to just have a great day.",

Needles are pretty extreme in most folk's books: you don't casually just stick things into your veins unless you're a serious addict. And the septum damage is pretty nasty too. You won't even notice it's fucked until it's too late, because it numbs the tissues. And let's not talk about the cardiac damage. I mean, you *can* do the same damage overdosing on caffeine if you work on it, right? \n\nLaws are imperfect, and it's cool to be cynical about it, but legalizing coke is not going to do the majority of folks anything good, and would put the majority of folks at greater risk. Should it be medically  prescribed? Maybe. But recreationally? Probably not. To make it harmless you'd have to nerf it down to caffeine levels and then why bother? You already have caffeine. \n\nBooze has issues. The fun part about this argument is that the damage you're all describing might be great reasons to go back to prohibition, and we all know how that went: it was the first \"war on drugs\" and booze won by a landslide. \n\nThe drug laws need to be revamped.

The firm is more important than any individual member, in their opinion, so Harry saying he\u2019s outta there to do his own thing is an affront to the others who have always done what was in the interest of the firm over their own. \n\nA lot of this goes back to when Edward, Duke of Windsor, abdicated the throne to his brother so he could marry a divorcee and hang out with Nazis. His brother became king despite always being the second son and his daughter, now Queen Elizabeth, went from being just a niece of the king to next in line. The turmoil from the abdication made the current line decide that everything thereafter should be done for \u201cthe firm\u201d even if against your individual wants and desires.",
            "To clarify up-front: I support Harry (he didn't choose to be born a royal, and I think it's reasonable for him to want out.) That being said, I can understand why, from a certain perspective, it seems disrespectful.\n\nBeing a member of the royal family is as much a responsibility as it is a privilege. The royal gain the influence and financial benefits that come with their birth and titles, but they take on the burden of ceremonially representing the U.K. abroad and maintaining a neutrality that allows them to bring the nation together under a very divided political system. For quite a few people, their identity as citizens of the U.K. is wrapped up very directly with royals themselves. Harry leaving the royal family isn't just leaving money and property behind (which he isn't immediately doing), it's abdicating a seat of responsibility and sloughing off the burden of representing British unity and tradition. The idea is that his bloodline has a responsibility to rule, which is what the monarchy is based around; the fact that he even has the choice to leave undercuts the basis of the whole system. Harry now gets all of the benefits of being famous (in an age when fame itself is the most marketable product around), but doesn't have the burdens that brought him that notoriety.",
            "Clearly I don\u2019t know everything or the entire situation, but to my understanding it seems like (I can\u2019t stress the \u2018seems like\u2019 enough) that many Brits **aren\u2019t** upset because he wants to step down as a senior royal and wants to live a more private life, but they do appear to be upset because he seemingly wants to relief his family (wife and child) of the burden but keep the titles and funding regarding security.\n\nMany people around me say that he has every right to step down but in doing so, should not expect for his travel expenses and security to be paid for considering he no longer will travel / stay at a specific country for Her Majesty, but rather for their (his and Meghan\u2019s) own purpose - with this I mean their own charity / brand.\n\nHonestly, I don\u2019t have an opinion on it since it\u2019s impossible for me to know every side to the story.

They cannot present their political views, they cannot take money for their appearances as that may speak about political or ideological views, and they stay away from dividing topics so as to act as a unifying force. \n\nThe problem with Harry and Meghan situation stems from the fact that they now wish to get away from the Royal Family and therefore their stances (or lack thereof). Their statement about becoming financially independent means that they will be taking opportunities to financially benefit from their appearances or portrayal of their opinion. This might speaking volumes about the Royal Family's own political or ideological views which will start dividing the country and it will become just another institution with which you either agree or disagree. \n\nNot to mention the fact that as and when the rest of the Royal Family sees them (Meghan and Harry) making lucrative deals, they might themselves become interested in doing the same further undermining the apolitical institution.",
            "This kind of thing is normally done very formally, with good reason, and after a lot of planning and discussion. The Duke of Edinburgh stood down from public duties because of his health for example. Them doing this of their own accord suggests a break from protocol or a rift somewhere. That is the only real reason for a \"crisis\" as they were blindsided and he was always expected to carry on with royal duties as before. In the wake of the Prince Andrew stuff too.",

Social media is taking away their power to generate sales and advertising revenue as celebs go direct to the public with their news, opinions and photos via the likes of instagram. \n\nHarry and Meghan have completely taken control of their own story now, and there's nothing they can do about it.\n\nI honestly don't know one single person IRL who gives a hoot about the Sussexes decision to move out of the public eye. \n\nThe vitriol in the media is about the papers' fear and anger over the shifting media landscape.  It's about money, sales and control, as they are in freefall from their previous position of influence.",

They have to be strictly neutral on basically all contentious issues, have to perform public acts and smile and wave when the cameras follow them around. It's quite difficult to explain to people who don't understand the cultural position the royal family occupy (and I say that as someone who wants the monarchy abolished), particularly to Americans who tend to have quite a negative view of the concept of monarchy. The institution of monarchy is more important to a lot of people than Harry and Meghan. If it becomes Harry Vs the monarchy, they'll choose the latter.\n\nMost people are fine with Harry deciding to walk away on the condition he actually does walk away. However it looks very much he wants to be a part time royal with most of the normal privileges but without having to meet the obligations unless he feels like it.\n\nHis family rely on the state a lot. Despite the comments in this thread Harry isn't particularly skilled or intelligent, his highest paying real job wasn't particularly good. His expenses will be very high. He previously relied on the state for expenses including security which costs an absolute fortune. The UK police have already said that moving to America would make this even more expensive. Even with a relatively wealthy wife it's questionable how the pair could afford that.\n\nHis only real way of paying for himself, beyond relying on Meghan, is to monetize his fame and effectively sell the royal brand for his own profit despite having just walked away from all royal responsibilities. That would be a massive mistake and would be extremely unpopular with the British public and the royal family. It's not the image that the royal family want for themselves or the image the British people expect of their royalty. Harry would effectively by trying to cash in on a brand that isn't his to sell out. The institution of monarchy is quite significant to the UK, culturally and constitutionally and selling out to make some easy money would cheapen the whole thing. It wouldn't be seen as Harry cleverly leveraging his background, it'd be seen similarly to if an American president undermined the very credibility of the institution of president to get rich.",
            "Its like being in an extremely nice prison.",
            "The Royal Family has to maintain that they deserve to have the riches and (unelected) power they hold, and their excuse is that they're just born into it and must continue. It jeopardizes their position when it turns out, nah that's definitely a choice",
            "[removed]",
            "If you\u2019re familiar with the life of Princess Diana at all, this makes sense.\n\nHarry was the closest to Diana, she left the royal family, it makes a lot of sense that he would leave too. The press is vicious to his wife and he is all too familiar with where that can lead.\n\nNetflix has a great documentary on Diana right now.",
            "Because he is taking royal money while not wanting to do anything in return. He can just abdicate and get a job like a normal person but he wants the money.",
            "I think the problem is he wants to have his cake and eat it too. He's doesn't want to leave the benefits of being a royal but wants to not do royal duties. Also I think taxpayers still have to pay for him and that's the big complaint among people I think. Nobody cares if he wants to do his own thing but the \"financially independent\" thing is a bit of a joke. As an American, I don't have to pay for Prince Harry so I could care less what he decides to do.\n\nI want to add it also sets a bad example for other royals and I'm sure Prince William isn't too keen on whatever influence it would have on George who has to go through so many royal protocols. If George sees his uncle just \"free\" so to speak, he might also want that for himself. Basically, one could say this could have a domino effect and cause an eventual deconstruction of the monarchy.",
            "Forgive me, but why does the monarchy need to exist at all? \n\nI mean, if he was giving up actual responsibilities, which he is in terms of building relationships and PR, but I mean more like responsibilities to the state, it would be problematic. \n\nHe's trying to dissociate from a body that has quite frankly become obsolete and take on financial responsibility and not be dependent on the crown's money. \n\nIt was bound to happen at some point. I'm surprised it took this long.",
            "Imagine being born into a job you couldn't quit.\n\nSeems kinda medieval, just like the institution of royalty.",
            "Because it keeps you from bringing up the pedo prince Andrew",
            "From what I understand, Harry is seeking to keep many of the benefits the royal family gets while trying to get out of fulfilling the duties that come with them.",
            "I guess one reason is that they still expect to enjoy a lot of substantial benefits that comes with being  royal while not having to perform the royal duties, or adhere to the restrictions other royals are expected to.",
            "He had just used \u00a32 million in tax payers money to renovate his cottage, and for him and his wife to walk away after that is pretty fucking scummy.",
            "I'd recommend you to watch The Crown @ Netflix.  You'll understand why for The Queen is a big deal.",
            "Because they still want to suckle on the British taxpayers' teat",
            "Simple answer:\n\nThey want to be \u201cfinancially independent,\u201d yet are still using an enormous amount of royal family resources to supply their lifestyle. From the purchase of several new family homes worth several million dollars each to the around the clock security provided by British police the entire family requires, it just isn\u2019t even remotely them \u201cgoing it alone.\u201d They are benefitting from the privilege of being members of the royal family while abandoning the responsibilities hat come with those privileges.\n\nIt also puts the rest of the family in danger because of two things. The first is timing. In the wake of the Prince Andrew stuff that\u2019s been happening recently, the royal family has already been dealing with a crisis and severe blow to their image in the eyes of the public. Harry and Megan turning their backs on the family now without informing them first just adds to it all in a really unhelpful way. The second issue is if they make an honest go of supporting themselves and rejecting the unearned privilege they enjoy simply because of their birth, which basically doesn\u2019t happen (even the abdicated King Edward lived the rest of his life on a royal \u201cpension\u201d), it could make the rest of the family look terrible in comparison by continuing to live off the public\u2019s money and enjoying all the other things they were simply born into.\n\nThe ultimate rule of the royal family is this: survival. The survival of the monarchy comes before all else. All decisions are made with this goal in mind above any other priority. Always. This selfishly spits in the face of that.",
            "Megxit!",
            "Oprah Winfrey advised Prince Harry and Meghan Markle about breaking free from the British royals and following their own path.\n\nThe TV queen \u2014 who attended the couple\u2019s wedding and is also close to Meghan\u2019s mom, Doria Ragland \u2014 discussed their \u201cdeclaration of independence\u201d and encouraged them to consider making a living in North America by building their own powerful brand.\n\nLeveraging the brand would be abusing the British taxpayer. They only have a brand because of their taxpayer funded life as royals to date - which was paid for on the assumption that they would do good charitable works, open hospitals etc and other royal deeds for the rest of their lives. Now they have decide they can\u2019t be bothered.\n\nBasically they are  walking away from all the boring bits of monarchy like charity and visiting small towns, and keeping their titles and continuing to act like A lister celebs. They should repay all public money given to them including 2.4m on home renovations and cost of their wedding.",
            "For the public here, it\u2019s more about principle. For example, The Royal Family exist mainly from public money, Harry and Meghan currently live in a large property that was recently renovated for them at great expense, from the public purse. So the way the people see it, if you don\u2019t want to do this \u2018job\u2019 anymore, then you should no longer receive the perks that come with it, and possibly even reimburse the money spent on you to carry out those royal \u2018duties\u2019. It\u2019s like expecting to keep the company car/house after you\u2019ve resigned.",
            "It's not really a big deal except for the media. You know, those guys who are responsible for the death of Harry's mother and keep harassing his wife. I can totally understand their decision. Seeing how the media reacts pretty much proves them right.",
            "It'd be like your job where you just decided one day, you're not going to do all of the annoying stuff but you still want the employee benefits and the paycheck. A lot of the fallout stems from the way they made the announcement and the fact that they didn't just abdicate. A lot of it also stems from the fact that the other Royals were totally blindsided (they found out from the TV not from Harry or Meg themselves). The tabloids have a field day with any royal drama and this has the added spice, so to say, that Harry & Meg don't want to do the annoying part of royal life but literally just finished using 3 million worth of taxpayer money to get married. It's mostly bad optics that the tabloids are feasting on. I get why they wouldn't want to do a lot of that stuff, but at the same time don't be a hypocrite either by not doing the public stuff but still taking public money.",
            "Harry isnt expected to do anything in terms of succession. The tabloids and low IQ consumers thereof have been brutal to his wife. It's unabashed racism and I dont blame them a bit if they fade away. They can't live in a fishbowl filled with racist piranhas.",
            "The Media likes to portray everything as a crisis, because if it isn't a crisis it isn't news.",
            "Like any \"job\" he should have the right to resign and go his own way, BUT if he does, as it appears he is going to do, despite who he is, then leaving he should also forfeit \"staff\" perks & benefits like free accommodation, salary,  travel benefits, uniforms & other special events clothing, police escorts to get through traffic, luxury car transport & free air transport, overly generous salary free vacation expense paid for and all the other perks that come with the job. He wants to do some things \"officially\" but not many firms allow part time employment. Let him go if he wishes, but he needs to give up his salary package & make his own way.",
            "Well it's a big deal to the Brits who pay taxed, because their taxes fund the royals, and Harry is stating that he still wants some compensation that way...",
            "He comes from a long line of pedophiles. Who's going to keep up the tradition of abusing children?",
            "Londoner here... I'm not sure it's seen as a big deal for him to step down from his duties (Prince stuff) - it's been done before in one way or another by other royal members.\n\nThe issue I think is that he and Meghan wish to essentially walk away from a job, yet keep the benefits such as royal residences and security.\n\nI heard someone describe it as \"you can't leave a job and expect to keep the company car\"",
            "Does a great job of distracting everyone from the fact Uncle Andrew is a dirty perv.",
            "It\u2019s not a big deal but it has totally taken the media\u2019s eyes off the Queens favourite son and  Epsteins rape buddy, Prince Andrew. Eliminating Epstein and scrubbing ALL evidence is par for course for Elizabeth who is widely regarded as the most powerful, richest and violent old lady in all recorded history.",
            "Absolutely loads of people are pissed off that he's taken millions in taxpayer money to fund his wedding, house, job, care and is now just fucking off.\n\nHe should have made this decision before they got married and not had us waste millions on someone who doesn't even want it when we've got people dying on trollies in the NHS.",
            "The Royal family is based soley of tradition and pomp now, since the turn of the last century they've become less and less revelant. The less relevant they become the more they cling to tradition. Harry wanting an independent life undermines the Royal families image.\nThose are the key reasons but mostly just stupid empiralism quashing individuality.",

Now that I live in a house I still do it because it has become habit (spent 16+ years in the apartment) and I actually find I miss it when it isn't turned on.

No I don\u2019t miss any of the acting because it takes about 1/4 second to read a line of text. \n\nI get all the nuance and jokes that were implied in the writing. I\u2019m also more visually inclined than auditory so I find it easier to comprehend ideas and language when I can hear it and read it.\n\nAnd for people who complain about missing things in the movie, I think in my head, \u201cyeah, because you read slow haha.\u201d",

I don\u2019t want to miss out on anything they say idk sometimes I can\u2019t catch certain things the actors says or it would be words or phrases I never heard of . For example there was a scene in the show \u201cGirlfriends\u201d (my all time fav) where one of the actresses mother said something I couldn\u2019t understand. For years I was trying to figure it out . I had no option for closed captions on my dvds at the time but recently I was able to find the episode on YouTube and it had the captions . She said something about \u201cgrabbing a switch\u201d which means to grab a tree branch to whoop her daughter (it was meant to be funny ) . Of course I forgot how she said it exactly but I was like wtf is a switch ? Lmao you learn something new everyday .

Like cinematic movies where the explosions and music are loud and epic, then the dialogue is whispering. Gives me time to adjust the volume on the remote without missing things. \n\nAnd I like them for all other shows, too.

But I ask Americans and English speaking people how much percentage on average do you understand the dialogues from movies and TV series? I'm sure there are some parts where almost none of them won't be able to understand since the dialogue audio is very low or also while the background noise is high especially in action movies.

The movie had a very old lady in it with an accent who mumbles and I couldn\u2019t understand a word she said.\n\nWhat\u2019s annoying is when the subtitles are a sentence or two ahead of what\u2019s being said on screen, then I will turn them off. \n\nYou also notice a lot more of discrepancies in subtitles.

Technically I don't have hearing problems but since I have ADHD and some sensory issues (get easily overstimulated since I'm on the autistic spectrum), subtitles keep me engaged to know where I am/helps me deal with fluctuating volume levels/focus and clarity in general. I could listen to a sentence and hear it completely fine but I wouldn't process what was actually said or meant unless I had the subtitles on.\n\nDownsides to always needing subtitles: I get really annoyed when I notice bad titling (Netflix is really bad on some shows, they literally re arrange sentences for no apparent reason but if someone can enlighten me to any reason this might happen that'd be great), if I'm watching anything with my parents or roommates they complain that subtitles distract them so I'm usually left having to compromise, my cinema never really has captioned screenings or anything since I'm in a small town.",

            "Yeah! It helps me process the show/movie better. I\u2019m a way more visual learner than an auditory one, so reading the subtitles helps me keep up with the plot. If they\u2019re not on, I find that my brain takes a few milliseconds to turn the sound into meaningful information, and I sometimes miss subtle but important elements because of that. \n\nI realized this is the same reason I have to take lots of notes during work meetings.

You might be asked if you've also bought fuel. Any shop might ask you if you want a bag (seeing as they're now 5p). Or if you're at a newsagents they might ask if you want 'anything else', because there are things behind the counter like cigarettes. So be prepared for that.",

            "I see the Irish in your name, so this is how it works in Ireland:\n\nEssentially what most other people have said, you go in, pick your items, someone might ask if you need help, you say you're just browsing or ask for their help finding things if needed, then you taken your items to the till, put them on the counter or the conveyor belt, using one of those little separator things to distinguish between your shopping and the people before/after you. You wait until they've scanned it all, they usually ask if you have a loyalty card, if you do, give it to them, if not, say no, and then say no when they ask if you'd like to sign up for one (or yes, if you do!). Then they give your total, and most places at the moment prefer card/contactless payment, so either put your card in the machine and when prompted, enter your pin, and wait for transaction to be approved. (Or tap your card/phone with NFC enabled against the card machine, usually there's a little symbol like a WiFi symbol to show you where, or the cashier will tell you if you're placing it wrong). Then they ask if you want your receipt, I usually just say yes, just in case I do. Then you pack up your bags and leave! \ud83d\ude01\n\n*NOTES*: Due to covid, the situation is a little different. \n\n- Some shops (Tesco, Aldi, spar, etc) have a queue outside, where the ground is usually marked where to stand. You have to wait until you get to the top of the queue and either a worker tells you to enter, or (in Tesco e.g.) a giant screen will have a green arrow saying \"please enter\" or a red X saying \"please wait\". \n\n- Most shops have hand sanitizer inside the entrance for you to use, so please use that when available.\n\n- All shops and public transport require a face covering to be worn, so remember that, and don't take it off or pull it down while in store, please.\n\n- There may be markings on the floor or signs specifying a one-way system, or markers to help you stay 2m away from others while shopping. Some people just refuse to follow them, but you just stick with what the signage says and you'll be fine.\n\n- Queueing in store is kind of similar to outside a store; there's markers on the floor and the cashier will beckon you to approach the conveyor belt when it's your turn, and will say when you can walk up towards them to pay and pack your stuff.\n\n\n- also, not specifically covid related, but in some shops (aldi), there isn't a little area where they put your shopping after they scan it and where you can pack -- instead, you kind of have to just put the items into your basket/trolley then when you've paid, take them over to the little counter (usually by a window, across from where you're standing), and pack your stuff there. \n\nFeel free to send me a message if you've any questions, or I've left anything out!",
            "Depending on the kind of shop it can be quite simple. For convenience, I'll give an example involving a general store.  \nSimply put the things you are hoping to buy on the counter, and wait for the person to scan everything and tell you the price. (s)he may or may not ask \"cash or card?\" or something of the like.  \nSay whichever method you'll be using, only have to say one word. \"Cash\" or \"Card\" though it is polite to say \"please\" as well.  \nThey may or may not ask if you would like a bag as well, quite a simple yes or no question.  \nOnce you've paid, you can take your things, and leave. It's always polite to say \"thank you\" when you're leaving as well.",
            "One key to beating social anxiety, at least for me, is realising nobody actually cares what you're doing or how you look. Everybody is honetly so stuck in their own head, too busy thinking about their own problems and their own anxieties, to give two hoots about what you're doing. That realisation is incredibly freeing. One you understand this, going shopping will become less of an issue. \n\nGradual exposure therapy helps for social anxiety. Do you think you could gradually become exposed to the fear trigger? I.e. spend five minutes in a shop, don't have to buy anything, just have a browse and then leave? Then the next time spend ten minutes in a shop and buy one small thing - a bar of chocolate perhaps. You don't have to have a conversation with the cashier the first time - just say hello and thank you. Then you can gradually build up to making small talk: \"how is your day going?\" etc, with the cashier.",
            "I also have severe social anxiety, so I understand how hard this can be!! I'm 25 and I still have a hard time with this.\n\nGo into the store and find what you want to buy. Like people have mentioned, someone might approach you and ask what you're looking for, I usually just smile and say that I'm just looking and they'll leave you be after that.\n\nWhen you're looking at the item and price, make sure you have enough cash and don't forget to add the tax, if you're in a country that doesn't include it in the listed price.\n\nOnce you have your item, go to the checkout and wait in line. I usually like that have my cash ready so that way you don't have to fumble in your pockets/wallet/purse. They'll ring your items through, tell you the amount to pay and you can hand over the cash. You can take the time to put your change back or keep them in your hands and put it away afterwards.  They'll also give you a receipt.\n\nAfter that you can head out the door and be proud of what you just accomplished!!!!\n\nSometimes, I have to walk in and out of a store a couple times before I work up the courage to do it. Nobody has ever given me weird looks or said anything about it, so if that happens, try not to worry about it!\n\nIf you have any questions, let us know!!!\n\nYou got this!!!!",
            "This is the perfect time for this because of covid. Nobody wants you close to them anyways! Lol\n\nAlso, be aware that other people in the shop won\u2019t worry about you. They will just assume that you\u2019ve done this a hundred times.  That is very powerful because it allows you to browse. \n\nOther people in the shop are worried about their own day, thinking and worrying about their own problems. They don\u2019t care why you\u2019re there or what you\u2019re shopping for. \n\nThey make sure you\u2019re mask is covering your face and move on. \n\nI\u2019d also recommend going to a real person to check out if you\u2019re going to a supermarket. The self serve scanners mess up some times.\n\nStep up to the counter. Pretend to be as bored as you have ever been. Hand the cashier the item(s) or set it on the counter. \n\nIf you misunderstand anything, or don\u2019t catch something, simply tell them.   \u201cSorry, didn\u2019t catch that?\u201d \n\nThe cashier has seen a hundred masked strangers this week. Drunk, stoned, whatever it may be. They\u2019ve probably seen it. They just want you to give them money so that you will leave so they can get back to whatever. They notice you in the moment. But after they tell you how much your stuff is they are already thinking about the next customer, \u201cand what the hell do they want? I still have to mop the bathroom before I can clock out;\u201d kind of thoughts. \n\nSo, while you might be worried that people are focusing on you, you are not important enough in a strangers life to be remembered after they leave the store.",

You\u2019re allowed to ask for help. What they don\u2019t want is for you to stay home. Ask them if you can join the next time they go shopping, you can quietly follow them around the store and watch what they do and how they interact. They will be happy you asked to join them, this shows a step towards independence. The next trip, you can still go with them but take charge. Be the one to find the product, take to the cashier, and pay. If you get stuck at any time, your parents are there to help. The trip after that, if all went well the first few trips, go alone. \n\nPoint is, you can ask your parents for help. They won\u2019t be upset that you are asking to learn. You can even say \u201cI want to learn how to be independent and shop on my own, can I join you on your next trip so I can learn how to do that\u201d. Communication is very important. Talk to them. You aren\u2019t alone and don\u2019t have to figure it out alone. You can do it alone if you want to but if you don\u2019t, it\u2019s okay to ask for help.",

            "I can't imagine what it must be like to live with that level of social anxiety. You're very brave to ask, and I think it's brave that you're willing to try new things.\n\nSo basically all you have to do is find what you want to buy and take it up to the cashier counter. They will scan your items and tell you how much money you owe them. You then either swipe your card or insert it into the chip reader or give them cash and wait for you change. \n\nSo here is how probably 99% of my conversations with Cashier's go\n\nMe: \"hi\"\n\nCashier: \"hi, how's it going?\"\n\nMe: \"good, how are you?\"\n\nCashier: \"good, did you find everything you were looking for\"\n\nMe: \"yeah I did\"\n\nCashier: \"good\" \n\n*Wait for them to finish scanning all of your items if they haven't finished already*\n\n Cashier: \"okay your total is (insert how much money you owe them)\"\n\nMe: \"okay\" *give them cash or swipe/insert your card into the reader*\n\nCashier: *gives you your change if you paid cash*\n\nCashier: \"Thank you have a good day\"\n\nMe: \"you too\"\n\n*Leave with your items*\n\n\nThey might ask you a few small talk questions, but usually they are super busy and getting ready for the next customer.\n\nI hope this helps",
            "I'll answer in the case of a self-checkout. \n* Note I'm from the UK, but I can't imagine this process will differ any. \n\nNormally there's a sort of bay, with rows of self checkouts along the sides. \nYou'll queue up as normal, and will either have to look out for a machine becoming free, or will be beckoned forwards by an employee (check that the machine hasn't got an out of order or other notice on it). \n\nOnce there one side of the machine will have a metal scale, and the other won't. Place your shopping on the side that doesn't. If you can't tell which is which, pick one and if the machine whines at you for not scanning something, you've picked the wrong side lol.\n\nThen you pick up one item, find and scan the barcode (there'll be glass squares in the middle bit of the machine with scanners behind them, normally one in the base and one on the front). Then place it on the scale. \n\nIf it asks if you're using your own bags, just tell it no. If you say yes it'll call an employee to verify and you'll have to wait. \nIf you're not using your own bags, there'll be bags on the side you can use, but you'll either have to tell the machine how many you've used, or scan them individually. If there aren't any bags and you need them, just ask an employee.\n\nIf ever an employee is called by the machine, either wait or flag one down yourself. \nThey'll check your ID if necessary, or just generally check whatever the machine wants, then input their ID and you're going again.\nSay hi when they arrive, but otherwise just stand aside and let them so their thing. \n\nOnce you're done scanning press the button to proceed to payment. Either scan your card, feed coins into the slot, or argue with the machine but how valid your crinkly notes are. \nTake any change and the receipt, and be on your way.",

It's almost like you are about to dive into a pool. Deep breath and dive in. Decide on something you can buy without having to think about it once in the shop.

            "Few very simple steps that involve minimal human interaction:\n\n1: enter store\n\n2: grab what you want (if you're getting lots of stuff try and get a shopping cart, some require you to enter a coin into a built in coin slot from your currency to \"unlock them\", you get the coin back when you put away the cart so always have some coins with you just in case)\n\n3: once you have what you want, put it on the counter where the guy stands or the conveyor belt, if there is a queue wait for your turn. If there is room on the conveyor belt for your stuff but the stuff of the guy im front of you is still there, you can place a divider that is usually lying around nearby that tells the cashier that this is where that guy's stuff ends and your stuff starts. If there is no divider you can still put yoir stuff there as long as you leave a clear gap that shows where his stuff ends and your stuff starts.\n\n4: guy will automatically scan each item, you don't need to ask or request anything although a good morning/evening is always welcome. If you worry about having to make conversation, don't, in 99.9% of the cases the workers just wanna do their job and get it over with, not make conversation and slow everyone down.\n\n5: after scanning it all he will tell you how much you are supposed to pay plus there is often a display you can see that directly shows you the cost of the items in case you didn't hear what he said\n\n6: you give him the money, if its cash and you gave him too much you can either wait till he gives you the rest back or you can say \"keep the change\" if you can't be bothered and move onto the next step.\n\n7: some stores have promotions or loyalty systems and the cashiers are required to ask you if you have X card or if you want one. If yiu're not interested, just say \"no, thank you\" and that usually ends the conversation.\n\n8: after the cash register there is usually a small spot where you can pack away the things you bought\n\n9: leave the store.\n\nOne very important thing to note: always take the receipt. Sometimes it happens that a scanned item doesn't quite register in the system and even though you bought it the alarms will go off when you leave.\n\nDon't panic, let the security guard check what made the alarm go off and show him the receipt proving you bought it just a second ago. Don't worry nobody will think you're stealing, this just happens very rarely.\n\nThis is pretty much the simplest most in-depth guide I can give you, it might be a bit stressful the first time or two but you'll get used to it very quickly, if you are unsure what to do then look around and see what other people do in your situation.",
            "It might be mentioned here, but don't worry about the time it takes to put your change away or gather your items.\n\nEveryone in line can wait, you waited too. \n\nSo take the time you need to put your money back in the appropriate pockets, etc.\n\nAnd remember that cashiers see hundreds of people and do not remember 99% of their interactions.

            "Hey buddy, you'll be alright.\n\nJust grab something, place it in your shopping cart and cruise around the store with a shopping cart and grab other things you want. The price of the item is on a sticker in front of the item, usually white or yellow, and sometimes they have special deals (like 4 for $10!), meaning you have to buy 4 of the exact same item for a overall reduced price.\n\nThere is no rhyme or reason to walking around a store,  but try to stick to one side of an aisle so other people can easily slide by you if needed. All you need to say is \"excuse me\" when you need to pass by someone, and they will always kindly allow it with a similar kind response.\n\nWhen you get to the front of the store, several checker stations will be open, or perhaps only one will. You can usually see if this is the case because they have large lights above their stations that will be illuminated if they are taking more customers.\n\nChoose one and bring your cart (or single item, whatever you have is fine!) Down the aisle in front of you. This allows a friendly bagger to bag your items and place them in your cart. You don't have to feel bad or anxious about this, they are paid to help you and are not bothered by doing so.\n\nThe checker will scan your items and probaply make small talk. You don't have to go above and beyond here, but a simple \"how's it going?\" From you will usually solicit a friendly greeting back. If they ask you how your day is, simple respond with \"good!\" Or \"it's going well!\" Then ask them about theirs. They will usually reply with \"good!\" And then give you your final price.\n\nYou can now pay by either handing them cash (they will complete the transaction for you by returning your change and receipt), or you can use a debit/credit card.\n\nTo complete a payment card transaction, all you need to do is insert your card into the reader with the chip side first (the chip is a large, silver square that acts as your cards special security ID). Sometimes you might only need to swipe it down the side, with the card's metallic strip on the back being closest to the reader, face down.  Enter your pin number when prompted to.\n\nThe reader will ask you some questions after your card is inserted (make sure to leave it inserted until the transaction is complete).\n\nSome questions will be:\n\n \"Do you want cash back?\"\n-This will withdraw quick money for you from your account. This is a good way to grab an easy ten or twenty dollars if you know you'll need cash after your store trip.\n\n\"Would you like to donate $XX.XX to charity?\"\n-The store you are at is involved in charitable acts and is asking if you would like to contribute some money. You can either click a dollar amount or say no at this junction.\n\nIf you are using a credit card as opposed to a debit card, you will have to put in your zip code at some locations like gas pumps.\n\nOnce the transaction is complete, you can remove your card (the reader or the checker will tell you), then the cashier will say \"Do you want a receipt?\".\n\nYou don't have to take it, you can say \"Yes please.\" Or \"No, thanks.\". Its always a good idea to take it though, because a receipt is needed to return damaged or incorrect goods.\n\nThey will usually say \"Have a good day!\" To which you should respond with \"Thanks, you too!\" And casually leave the store with your bagged goods.\n\nYou can take the shopping cart out with you to your family's car and place your items in it, then you should be courteous and return your shopping cart either to special holders they have outside in the parking lot, or directly in the store.\n\nAnd you're done! \n\nYou'll be alright.

They are trying to scan items through as quickly as possible. \n\nIf you are worried that someone will comment on your purchases, you can come up with a prepared response. It doesn\u2019t even have to be true. I once bought $1200 worth of tampons and maxipads for the women\u2019s shelter I work at. The cashier was understandably shocked by the mountain of feminine hygiene products going through the line. I just shrugged my shoulders and said \u201cI\u2019ve got a heavy flow.\u201d When I have had to buy condoms by the thousands I have said \u201cI am in the middle of a water balloon fight and I am taking no prisoners.\u201d You can also just blame the purchases on someone else \u201cSo and so wanted me to grab a few items for them.\u201d\n\nEven if you do something really weird, it won\u2019t go as badly as you think it will. A few years ago I was having some neurological problems that gave me muscle spasms and made it difficult for me to walk or stand. My arms would sometimes fly up at random or I would lunge while walking. I hated going to stores because I knew that people stared. I was in a weed dispensary and my tics were getting bad. The bud tender would offer me a strain to smell by holding it out for me to take the container and sniff. I told her that I have muscle spasms that make it difficult for me to hold things and sometimes result in me accidentally throwing them. I was so embarrassed. The more embarrassed or anxious I get, the worse the tics get so it was non-stop. \n\nThe bud tender was so compassionate. She had someone bring me a chair. She would put flower up to my face for me to smell. She picked out strains that were helpful for people who experience muscle spasms. She told me not to be embarrassed and that they see tons of people who have medical issues. She said that those were her favorite clients because she knew that marijuana helped reduce their suffering. She actually gave me the medical patient discount (I didn\u2019t qualify) and told me that if I ever had problems at any other dispensary to let her know so that she could go off on them. It meant the world to me. \n\nWith anxiety it can feel like there is a spotlight on you. The reality is that you blend in so much that you are more like an NPC in a very dull game. \n\nGood luck to you!",
            "How are you? Or if how's it going'. Or if they ask first just say, well, and you?\n\nAs for what to do.  If it's a grocery store or CVS style. Pick out items with a basket, cart or by hand, wait in the allowed line for either a automated kiosk which are non person to person, or up to an employee at either a counter or conveyor belt. Use generic greeting from above, smile, put items on desk, check out if automated, or put on conveyor. At the end theyll ask for cash or card sometimes. Or the machine will ask. If you aren't sure which type of card you have and your parents. Cash is easy. Hand them the cash they do the rest. Card you insert chip side in or swipe bar side in. Pin is sometimes needed. Sometimes they will ask if you want a paper or email reciept. I usually say no to both. And last thing. Sometimes they ask for rewards numbers or gift cards, that you can also say no thanks to. Now you're free, say either have a nice day or if they say it first you respond with \"you too\" or \"you as well\" \n\nI was scared as a kid to do this, and even now I don't like going into places on my own. But most workers are really nice people and will help you with the card if you need help or even fork over an extra dime if needed. Take a deep breath and remember your training.",
            "So I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve gotten some comments already but I\u2019ll add my own in. I\u2019m a cashier and as the top comment I read already said we deal with some of the nicest, and craziest people. So we also interact with people who don\u2019t really want to interact. Depending on where you go you might be able to use self checkout where you can put headphones in and ignore everyone. But if you\u2019ve got to go to a cashier typically they\u2019ll say two things. 1. Hi, how are you today? Or some form of greeting, just reply with a hi or hello. Usually whenever someone doesn\u2019t give me a longer reply to that I assume they don\u2019t want to talk and will only ask them questions if I absolutely have to, and ask them the second question. 2. Did you find everything you were looking for? Just say yes. Even if you didn\u2019t theres not much we can do but say sorry. And that\u2019s it, if you aren\u2019t talking to me I won\u2019t talk to you anymore. After they finish ringing everything up, they\u2019ll say your total and depending on where you go the store might have some sort of rewards program. I guess they\u2019ll ask 3 things if they do. Just say no when they ask about it. Then they\u2019ll say your total, you hand them the cash you\u2019ve got or insert/swipe your card depending on how you\u2019re paying, and the cashier or card reader will take it from there. As a side note on the card reader it will ask for your PIN which is a number you would have picked if you have a card and it might ask if you\u2019d like money back which is basically taking money from your card and turning it into cash. Like going to the bank. After the machine says to take your card out or the cashier hands you change they\u2019ll say something along the lines of have a good day, hand you your receipt and you\u2019ll be good to go. Let me know if I didn\u2019t explain something well enough and I\u2019ll be happy to go into more detail for you. Good luck I know it sounds difficult, I use to also have extreme anxiety before becoming a cashier so I know what it\u2019s like but you got this. If you need to try practicing some responses to yourself before you go.",
            "Now is the best time to get the hang of it, with everyone having to wear masks your a lot less likely to get into long conversation. Apple Pay on iPhone (and the android equivalent) make paying much easier. Just say a quick hi to the cashier and thank you/have a good day afterwards. You don\u2019t have to say anything but being polite is always appreciated. If nothing else, just a nod and a mumbled thanks would do",
            "I'm currently on holiday with a friend in a country where I don't speak the language and noone here speaks my language. I already have anxiety from buying, but here it's worse, so maybe what I do can help you\n\nFirst, i always count how much things will cost exactly. Use your phone as a calculator is you want. It will allow you to know exactly how much you're spending but also allow you to prepare the money you need to pay before the cashier has even told you the total. It saves me the stress of scrambling to find the money quick and, in a country where I don't understand what they are saying to me, i can simply smile and hand over the cash\n\nSecond, no need to even talk. Put down the items on the counter. When they've scanned it and tell you the total, just smile at them while giving them the money. You can make eye contact, or just look down at your hand, or even pretend to make eye contact but keep your eyes closed for a second to avoid looking thel directly in the eyes.\n\nThird, they will either ask you if you want the receipt or tell you to have a nice day. I do a little nod again. You can even say a little thank you. Then if they start handing you something it's the receipt, take it then leave. If they don't give you the receipt, they were simply wishing you a good day and you can leave straight away.\n\nThese are simply little things I do to avoid talking. All interactions go down pretty much the same, so once you've got the hang of it it will be a lot easier\n\nGood luck!",
            "I'm 28 and female, and I still have crippling social anxiety to this day.  \n\n\nHere is what I do.  I look online first - if it's walmart and I only need a few things... I look up the item, the price, and budget for the total, always rounding up one dollar. I hate being caught in the checkout and not having enough - talk about the spotlight... eesh... >///<   \n\n\nSo always have an extra dollar or two AFTER finding out how much you'll need for everything. If possible, have physical cash on you - transaction will be faster and easier for both parties, you and the cashier.  If you have a card, make extra sure you have all the money you need. If you are using EBT for food or something, download the Fresh EBT app so you don't have to dial a number and use the phone (it's automated to check the balance, but there's a comfort in not having to physically start a phone call).  \n\n\nNow... the actual shopping part is much easier. If someone talks to you, just be friendly and casual. A smile and a nod or \"oop...so sorry\\~\" if you need to sneak by them. That come across as courteous but clearly in a hurry, so nobody will stop ya. You shouldn't really have to interact with anyone unless you truly need to or feel compelled to.  \n   \nIf you need to ask someone for help looking for something, don't seek out another patron, seek out an employee - they know the store inside and out. More importantly, try to take your time walking. Count your breaths or steps... and just make a B-Line to your necessary item(s).   \n\n\nLastly, remember that you're doing great. Seeking assistance for this kind of thing is a great step toward learning how to cope and live \\*with\\* mental illness and not work \\*around\\* it. So I'm proud of you, Irish - keep going and remember to breathe. :)",

You are politely asking these people to participate in their job. And some people appreciate it! So just let them know, you appreciate their help.\"\n\nDon't treat it as you're demanding a cashier to ring up your products. Treat it as a friend asking a friend to help out. And many people appreciate their jobs and will love to help. That's only if you're a good customer and show you appreciate others work :)\n\nYes, it's scary to walk up and talk to people.  It's even scarier when you feel like you are **telling** them to do something for you.\n\nBut you aren't.  It's like asking a family member to pass the salt. They will be glad you asked instead of reaching over, and would happily past it to you :)\n\nI can't change the way you feel (anxiety and all that comes with time) but I can atleast ease the perception of it :p\n\nBest of luck Kiddo. I wish I had people to talk to for this",
            "as someone who has worked in customer service and at a register in two drastically different locations, i can confidently say that youd have to do A LOT to stand out negatively. \n\nmoving past that- when u have all your items that u wanna buy, u wait in line with them until the person in front of u is done checking out. with covid, i usually wait until the person in front of me leaves the counter before putting my stuff on the conveyer belt thing, but the people at the register will let u know if theyre ready for u to put ur stuff down before that. if its just one counter, no belt, then wait until the person grabs their stuff and walks away before walking up to the counter and putting ur stuff down.\n\njust being generally polite is all u need conversation wise, and even then, if ur quiet and say practically nothing, itll pretty much go unnoticed. theyll scan all ur stuff and when theyre done, theyll tell u the total. at that point u either hand them cash or put ur card in the little machine and follow whatever directions the machine gives u. i usually get my card out or get cash ready while they scan the items to help it go faster. \n\nthey might ask if u want a bag, thats up to u to say yes or no. if yes, theyll bag it up for u and u take it and be on ur marry way. if not, then u grab ur stuff and again, be on ur marry way. \n\ncongrats: uve successfully gone shopping and checked out ur items!\n\nquick tip: if ur using cash and are handed change, i personally stuff the change in my pocket and dont worry about sorting it into my wallet until im out of line and out of the way. if im using a card, i keep my wallet out and in my hand so that when im done with it i can put it back quick and easy. \n\nfor the most part, the cashier will ask u for anything they need beyond that or give u a cue when ur supposed to pay, grab items, etc. they deal with people on autopilot all day every day, so theyre used to basically having to spell out for people when they need to do something. they also wont care much about what ur buying, since again, theyre just there to scan ur stuff. the only time theyll say something is if ur buying drugs (over the counter, like nyquil) or alcohol while being underage. otherwise, they really dont care.\n\nsorry if this is wayy more in depth than u wanted, but as someone with a lot of anxiety myself, this is the kind of thing i\u2019d want to hear for simple things that worry me. like a script to follow",

            "I also have social anxiety and I live alone because of it so I often have to do things on my own. I don't know how helpful this is but it's probably more helpful than all the people commenting things like 'It's okay, don't be worried' or 'Nobody cares what you're buying' which is easy to say but they fail to understand what someone with social anxiety is going through.\n\n\nI don't know if there is a proper way to buy things. I just want to go inside and get out as quickly as possible but every store is basically this: Go inside, pickup what you want to buy from the shelf, the price is usually listed on the shelf it's sitting on, sometimes it has a label on it. Go the the checkout, pay and it's finally over. The checkout person will probably ask how you are, just say you're fine and it usually ends there. If they say 'did you find everything okay', just say yes even if you didn't find what you wanted. The last time I said no she called someone over to help and I almost had a panic attack. \n\n\nI always prioritize stores with self checkouts. This way I don't have to try and talk to someone. It's also easier because I often fail to read body language to know when you're suppose to hand them money and wait for change. This is the part I hate the most because there's always this look of disgust when they hand me change. Most of the time they won't even give it to me and they place it all on the counter.\n\nI also try not to use a cart if I don't have to. It makes it easier to avoid crowds if you can carry what you need or can use a basket.  \n\nThe only good thing to come from COVID is that it's easier for people with anxiety since you can usually buy things online and pick them up or have them delivered.",

            "Hello! I used to also be in your shoes and you\u2019re taking a step in the right direction. After lots of practice, I feel comfortable buying stuff for myself now. I currently work at a job where I\u2019m at the register a lot, so I deal with lots of different types of customers. So here is how you do it:\n\n1. Browse the store and work out what you want to buy. You can take as long as you like. Sometimes, a worker might greet you and ask if you need help. If you need help looking for something in particular, you can ask \u201cYes please, I was wondering where I can find [Item]\u201d. They\u2019ll then direct you in the direction or take you to the item. If you don\u2019t need any help, all you have to say is \u201cNo thanks, I\u2019m just browsing for the moment\u201d.\n\n2. When you find what you want to buy, pick it up and bring it to the counter. It might be on a conveyer belt or just a bench. Place it on the conveyer belt or the bench and wait for the worker to come (most times, they\u2019ll already be there). A little tip: Have your money easy to grab and ready! It\u2019ll make everything a lot quicker. \n\n3. The worker will scan your item. Sometimes, they\u2019ll ask for a loyalty card (Some stores have member cards that can give you discounts or rewards). If you have one, they\u2019ll scan it, and if you don\u2019t, just say \u201cNo I don\u2019t\u201d. They\u2019ll then ask you if you want to use cash or card. I heard you wanted to use cash, so hand them enough money to pay for the item. It can be more than what the item costs, they\u2019ll hand you your change after. They might ask if you want a receipt or docket. It\u2019s proof of purchase, so if it\u2019s something expensive that you might have to return (Like headphones or a keyboard) it\u2019s always good to ask for it, just in case. Sometimes they\u2019ll give you one anyway.\n\n4. Once it\u2019s all over, say \u201cThanks! Have a good day\u201d to the worker. Then you leave the store and you\u2019ve done!! \n\nI serve many customers a day, and I can promise you that you won\u2019t stand out for any bad reasons, but if you say please and thankyou, you\u2019ll stand out because you were nice :) Workers really appreciate that. I\u2019ve probably encountered a lot of people in your situation while working, and I can\u2019t even remember them. The only time I remember a customer is when they\u2019re really mean. Most of the time, the only thing the worker is really paying attention to is how much longer they have until their shift ends; if you muck up, we won\u2019t remember it. A lot of people make little mistakes sometimes, and it\u2019s okay! Remember that you\u2019ve already come really far by wanting to do this and wanting to get out of your comfort zone. That\u2019s a MASSIVE step and you should be proud of that alone. The first time will be a bit scary, but just remember what you need to do and don\u2019t be too hard on yourself. It gets easier each time, and before you know it, it\u2019ll be second nature. \n\nYou\u2019ll do great! Keep us all updated :) We\u2019re rooting for you!",

            "well in a shop you don't have to say anything to the cashier that you don't want to. putting what you want on the counter and having the money to pay for it are really the only parameters for buying something from a shop.  you may want to practice first, by going into the shop you like, mentally selecting what you might buy, and retreating without making a purchase.  that way you can watch how others do it, what they might say to the cashier, what possible questions the cashier would ask of them.  anything new does take practice, and I encourage you wholeheartedly to begin this process!  you can do it. then if you are still very nervous, perhaps begin with buying something you know the price of, like a candy bar or packet of gum and having exact change, so the transaction is smooth.",

            "Hello. I had extreme social anxiety as well. I want to let you know that the people who work in service positions literally don\u2019t care about you no matter how awkward you are and are just trying to get through their own work day. Even if you have an uncomfortable interaction they will forget it almost immediately. I realized that years ago and now I don\u2019t have any issues going up to the counter and buying things or asking for stuff. But when I was your age it felt scary to me. Just get what you want from store, go up to the counter, they will scan your items and tell you the cost. You pay. They put it in a bag and then you walk away with the bag. It\u2019s pretty straightforward and you don\u2019t really need to say anything particular except thank you when they hand you the bag. Buying food involves more talking but you just say your order and then pay. Sometimes you get a number and have to wait for them to call you. Just stand to the side and wait. It\u2019s all really easy when you get the hang of it. Trust me no one is judging you and especially since you are 15 and plenty of sheltered kids like you and me when I was your age are SUPER shy when they are shopping and us adults know that\u2019s because you are new to doing things on your own. Just have confidence in yourself and know it\u2019s okay to make mistakes or have an awkward moment. Even at 30 I have super awkward interactions with people when shopping or asking for help. It\u2019s totally normal and no one thinks about it much longer afterwards. I feel like I also understand that even better now that I have been on the other end of it and trust me I don\u2019t care if someone is shy or awkward and still learning. I always feel the desire to help not judge. So by extension most other people are like that too I\u2019m sure.",

So having a set of 'automated' responses ready to go often helps to reduce potential anxiety.\n\nSimple open-ended replies like \"How's your day? / Almost done (or 'just starting')\"  , \"How are you? / I'm getting there\" are entirely acceptable and often prevent further small talk when used politely. \n\nAlways remember though, that they're just people too and cashier's often don't care in the slightest if you're too slow, too fast, or don't say anything, and they especially don't care what you're purchasing (unless is an item requiring ID).",

Then go there when you're ready.\n\n* If you're worried about looking weird or something. Just remember that these people (the cashiers) just want to go home. They don't care about how you look, how you act etc. They want to scan your items, take your money and then rinse and repeat until their shift is over, nothing more. And the other shoppers also just want to get their stuff and go home, they probably won't even look twice at you.",

You might prefer this because you can check out quickly and won't have to worry about fumbling with bills or receiving change.

I'd also suggest buying just one small item your first time so you don't have to worry about bags or anything. \n\nAlso, choose a store that 1) doesn't have a ton of customers because sometimes the pressure of a line behind you can make it less smooth and you want your first purchases to be easy peasy lemon squeezy and 2) choose a store where there is little contact required, like perhaps a gas station when it's not busy (vs buying a coffee for example, because you'd have to \"place an order\"). \n\n\nYou got this, OP!",

            "Now's a good time to do these things since people are (hopefully) social distancing and in general you will be forgiven for being a bit more reserved and quiet. When you head into the store you will look for the item you need. Depending on the shop (grocery store for example) the aisles will be marked to make it easier to find. If you cannot find the item you need, you can ask an employee. I would say \"Excuse me, could you tell me where x is?\" and they'll point you in the right direction. From there, take your item and bring it to the register, pay and be on your way. Don't overthink these exchanges because the people you interact with at the store are working and will likely forget about you before you've even left the shop.

            "US over here so this might be a bit different but one thing I haven't seen anyone mention yet is that some employees in a shop will ask if you want to have the stuff you are holding to be held for you. This means that they want to take the stuff you were maybe planning on buying to be held near the counter so your hands are free to do more shopping. Is a technique they do so you buy more stuff. I worked in retail before and was told this to increase sales. Just be honest and say no thank you if you don't want them doing that. They might ask if you want to try on what you are holding. This is another selling technique since you'll most likely buy the items to want to please the employee helping you. If you really want to try it on and you don't like it then do not buy it. You'll have buyer's remorse. Keep trying stuff on though if the first few things don't work for you! Only buy of you actual like it and it fits. The worst thing is that feeling of like you failed the employee helping you. It's not real and they will forget the interaction by the end of the day.\n\n Also, Some retail employees will want to push you to sign up for credit cards and that can be very annoying. They might not even say credit card when they pitch but say instead \"store credit\". Don't ever do this. It will ruin your credit if you aren't careful. If you ever feel like you need assistance just PM me anytime and I'll help you through whatever you're going through. I'm in the Midwest of the US so the time zones will be a bit wonky but helping a fellow humans worth the slight inconvience :)",

            "I feel you, dude. Something that helped me is to remember that the cashiers don't really care what you buy - they're probably thinking about their partner as they ring you up, or the birthday party that's coming up in their life, or that they need to buy cat food on their way home. Whenever I'd buy sweets or pizza or something like that, I'd be anxious that the cashier would think I was a disgusting fat fuck. But they really, really don't.\n\nAs for the actual process, it helps to smile and greet them. Some cashiers are cheery, they may comment on your clothes, or your hair, or say anything nice to you. Just thank them, they don't expect you to return any compliments. When they give you your change, hold out your hand. That way, you won't have to pick it up off the counter (however, a lot of people now intentionally put your change on the counter due to covid, so this may not work). Also, cashiers don't hear a lot of courtesy, so maybe tell them to have a nice day when you leave! But if that feels too scary It's fine!",
            "As someone who has worked in a lot of different retail places (in the US), a simple nod works instead of a greeting. We see all kinds, and won't judge you or what your purchasing, and we get that sometimes customers don't want to chat. The nod when you get up to the register, or a simple wave to someone who might ask if you're finding everything ok while in the store will let whoever know that you don't want to start a conversation. Also, as others have mentioned, know what you want to pay with, and if you have it in your hand, then you can even skip the \"how are you paying?\" question. I have one-sided interactions all the time (as the worker asking the questions), and its totally fine! Hope this helps.",

Normally I\u2019d say no, specially to just a gum. \nPick up your gum and say \u2018Goodbye, enjoy your day\u2019 and now you can leave.",
            "I\u2019ve had this same conversation with a good friend of mine with the same problem. I\u2019m a cashier at a supermarket and I can wholeheartedly, without a doubt in the world, 100% guarantee that no matter what happens, no matter if you stutter or lose your words or it\u2019s awkward or something goes wrong, that cashier will not remember you for longer than about 2 minutes. They see hundreds of faces a day and unless you do something that genuinely upsets them, their interaction with you will be so incredibly common that it\u2019s not even something that they will bat an eye over. The only customers I remember and judge are the ones that are arseholes. And you seem like someone who cares about others a lot and is kind and thoughtful. You\u2019ll do fine. A smile goes a really long way too!",
            "Start small. Buy a drink from a local shop first. Just take what you want to the till, give it to the person behind, then pay with cash or card when they tell you the amount. Most of your interactions will be similar, just longer depending on how many items you have for them to ring up, and may involve queuing in a supermarket. It helps to have as close to the exact amount you need too if paying with cash to save fiddling with coins as people wait. If using card, be careful as some places have a minimum spend limit before they'll accept card payments, usually 3 or 5 quid.\n\nDont feel obligated to make small talk, but if you want to try it out, go for it! Even if you stumble or mess up, odds are they won't remember you after serving the next customer. Say hi, ask how they are / their shift has been. Mention the weather, use all the cliches, most people are polite enough to respond.\n\nGood luck!",
            "Super easy.\n\n1. Know how much you can spend \n2. Pick out what you want\n3. Go to the checkout (stand in line if you have to COVID guidelines suggest 6 feet apart but even without them generally you want 2 to 4 feet between the person in front of you)\n4. Just give a simple \"hey how's it goin\" to the clerk (at worst they will say \"good you\" and then you just say \"good\" no one in retail at the counter expects a long conversation at this point in the transaction your at a shop not looking to buy a car)\n5.The clerk will ring your items into the system and tell you how much it is and you present a payment card or cash.\n6. The clerk gives you your change and/or a recipient and your done! If you don't get change and want to avoid worrying about taking the recipe from them you can just ask them to put it in the bag with the rest of your things or throw it away for you.\n\nThe only extra things is they may ask if you want a bag if you have anxiety just think about the question before you even get to the counter My general rule is: if you needed a basket or cart for your purchase theb you need a bag. Some stores have like a rewards card just say \"no thanks\" as a default\nanswer.\n\nAlso remember it gets easier as you go eventually you won't even think about it.\n\nSide note: after 5 is 6 and when I go to edit the post It says its a 6 but is showing a 5 so \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",
            "One tip, when you do something weird or wrong, which *will* happen sooner or later, learn from it and move along. We all are new to things and mistakes will happen",
            "Btw, if you're ever at a store and don't know what to do, you can always tell the cashier \"I'm sorry, this is my first time shopping by myself. How do I do that?/What am I supposed to do?\"\n\nYou can always ask for help. They'll understand and they'll help you out.",
            "Idk where you're from but common questions you might be asked. \n\nPaying with card or cash?\nDo you want you want a bag?\nDo you want you want a receipt?\n\nIn general with common courtesies work quick. Yes/no thank you. I sometimes like to go to shops a bit farther away than usual bc in my head I feel like even if I get embarrassed at least I won't HAVE to go there again. \n\nAlso to be honest most cashiers or workers don't even make contact or say anything other than \"HI, how are you\" but don't  actually want to make conversation.",
            "find out what you need ...\ngo get it in store ...\ngo to cashier and give it to them and however u can pay for it ...\nthe end",
            "A thing to note is most employees only get as engaged as you are. If you give them short (but hopefully pleasant) answers like \"hi, good, no thanks, I'm alright\" they'll probably get out your hair. In the US the typical experience is like this: \n\nGo to store, if it is a really large retailer they may have a door greeter, their job is to generically say hi to everyone (not just you), and be a reference if you need help finding anything, and in general deter shoplifting. In a smaller store (especially for clothes or shoes) an employee might ask if you need help finding something. You can always say no, and they might inform you of a sale. Just say \"okay thanks\" and they should smile and move on to the next person. \n\nKnow your size, get the item you want, carry it up to the cashier, queue, say hi or hey or whatever. They may ask if you found everything okay, then they'll ring it up and you pay cash or card. They give you receipt, maybe tell about a survey or whatever, and then you say a generic goodbye and leave."
