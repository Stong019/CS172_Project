            "It's one of those tricky phrases where nothing in particular about the phrase is racist ... but racist people use it for racist reasons, so you really have to judge the context.\n\nIt would be like if neo-Nazis adopted the phrase \"I enjoy vanilla ice cream\" and started including it in their slogans, propaganda, and graffiti. There's nothing fundamentally fascist about saying you like vanilla ice cream, and plenty of people who aren't Nazis think vanilla ice cream is great ... but if Nazis started using the term, well, those of us who like vanilla ice cream for the flavor have to start being careful about when we say so.\n\nSame deal with Blue Lives Matter. Fundamentally it's a great sentiment. Of course the lives of our police officers matter! Who could argue otherwise?\n\nBut the bulk of the people saying \"Blue Lives Matter\", at least at first, were saying it as a counter-argument to \"Black Lives Matter\", and well ... like it or not, \"Blue Lives Matter\" is something that racist people have made their own.\n\n[Edit: wow! I make a Reddit comment, go to work, and come back to an actual civil discussion! I'm proud of y'all. Many thanks for all the comments (and upvotes and awards of course).\n\nIf you're new to the thread, definitely check out the comments below about the swastika in this scenario. I was tempted to bring that up as an example myself, but decided against cluttering the point with a history lesson]",
            "So \"blue lives matter\" originates as a response to the phrase \"black lives matter\". \n\nBlack lives matter originated because of the way much of the public, media, and police tend to regard (even if subtly/unknowingly) black lives as being worth less than that of other lives, a black person being killed isn't as big a deal as say a white person being killed. \"Black lives matter\" was a rallying cry to say that 'black lives matter *too*, stop disregarding our wellbeing'.\n\nThe fact that \"blue lives matter\" exists almost entirely as a response to \"black lives matter\" laces it with a lot of subtle racism. It suggests a subtle rejection of the notion that \"black lives also matter\". It also suggests subtly that modern police policy is not only A-OKAY but that it should be defended or encouraged, that there is nothing wrong with police randomly killing people, particularly people of color.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge the nature of modern racism is one of subtly; Modern racists typically aren't going around shouting the N-word or such, because for most people that automatically signals \"these are the bad guys\" and will turn against them. So instead, modern racists will use actions and phrases that have plausible deniability about being racist so as to not turn away moderates, while still signalling to other racists \"yeah, we are on the same side,\" and still achieving much of the same results of suppressing those minorities they dislike.\n\nThis doesn't necessarily mean every person using \"blue lives matter\" is racist, in much the same way that not every person brandishing a confederate flag is necessarily racist. But it is important for everyone, especially those people using these symbols, to understand their broader meaning and origin, and to understand that even if not your intention these symbol have inherently racist meanings to majority of people, racists and anti-racists alike, and that you can't easily divide the symbol from its racist subtext.",
            "It's kind of missing the overall point of the \"Black lives matter\" message. Cops lives do matter, but they are also the ones in the position of power who are constantly abusing it. They don't really need people in their corner. I wouldn't call it racist, I'd call it very ignorant.",
            "blue lives do not exist. being a cop is a choice. being black is not. cops get to \"unblue their life\" by dropping the uniform, black people do not get that benefit. \n\nand that's only the superficial part of the criticism of \"blue lives matter\".",

            "I'm a law enforcement officer in Canada, and I cringe when I hear the term \"blue lives matter.\"\n\nEveryone matters. All lives matter. Black lives matter. Indigenous lives matter. Trans lives matter. Every child matters. I'm sorry for those I did not mention, but you matter too! \n\nIf we want to include blue lives matter, it should be flat out at the bottom. Not as a sign of disrespect to officers at all, but because an officer who does the job for the right reasons puts all those other lives above their own. To me, that's the idea.\n\nTo answer the question though, literal translation isn't racist. It can become a racist term based on context. \n\n(edited for grammar... English is hard some days)",
            "Heres the bottom line: Black Lives Matter was a protest phrase made to protest being murdered by police and being profiled and discriminated against. Blue Lives matter is a *counter*-protest to all of that. A *counter*-protest to *wanting to not be murdered* or *discriminated against*. You do the math.",
            "\ud83d\udc4c was apparently \"co-oped by white supremists\" at some point, which sucks because it's a really handy symbol. I refused to let this happen, something something don't let the terrorists win, and I kept using it. Until my more liberal friends would say shit like \"hey you should know it's kinda awkward to-\" and from that point on I didn't really know what to do. I still don't.\n\n\"Blue lives matter\" doesn't really have a neutral use. It was never anything before \"Black lives matter\" existed. So it's kind of *inherently* racist, yes.\n\nIf you want to say that you value the lives of police officers, just use different verbiage.",
            "The term in political science is a dog whistle. \n\nA dog whistle is a whistle that is too high pitched for humans to hear, but dogs can. \n\nIt works the same for political science. You can craft a slogan or message that is innocuous to most people (the humans), but resonates with racists (the dogs). \n\nBlue Lives Matter was an explicit reaction to Black Lives Matter.  Racists, particularly those who embrace law enforcement repressing black people,  adopt the term. \n\nHowever, it could also be an innocuous message about supporting hard working civil servants, but it isn\u2019t. That\u2019s the beauty of the dog whistle.",

            "[deleted]",
            "It\u2019s not inherently racist. The phrase itself isn\u2019t. But do a lot of racist people use it, yes. The phrase has been synonymous with them. Just like All Lives Matter isn\u2019t a racist statement. But the context surrounding it makes it so. Context is everything. Of course police lives matter, but the phrase is in direct protest of BLM or BLM related efforts.",
            "There is no such thing as a blue life, it\u2019s a job, they take off their uniforms after every shift. It\u2019s a response to Black Lives Matter, to be dismissive of the actual message which is that no lives matter until black lives finally matter.",
            "Notice how you never heard it until BLM became a thing? People pull that Blue Lives Matter nonsense in response to Black Lives Matter.\n\nBeing a cop is a choice. Being black isn't.",
            "It can be seen as racist, because 'blue lives matter' originated as a response to 'black lives matter' - in a way, it's like saying \"shut up\" to people complaining about police brutality.\n\nBut not all people who use it are doing so out of racism. Many people just mean \"I respect the police\".",
            "The thing about \"blue lives matter\" is that that phrase didn't exist until black lives matter did. It was created purely as an antithesis to it, as something to shout back in retort, and never seems to matter unless it's for that purpose (how many cops got covid and they all kept going maskless anyway?)\n\nSo why is scribbling it on a rock bad if it isn't an apparent retort in that context? Because it's done for the same reason a person would scribble a swastika or \"white power,\" and it's intended to stake a claim.",
            "[deleted]",
            "I'd say yes because it is a direct response of retaliation against black lives matter. And here is food for thought, you aren't born a cop but you are born a black person.",
            "It is. The phrase originated as an opposition to the idea that Black lives matter. There are no blue lives except Smurfs and Avatars. This phrase tries to make it seem like a profession, a so-called \"blue life,\" is more important than the life of a human being with darker skin (a Black life). But there aren't blue lives, because cops can take off their uniform and choose their profession, and a Black person doesn't choose their appearance nor can they change the color of their skin.",
            "It kind of is, but in subtle ways. \"Blue Lives Matter\" came out as a response to \"Black Lives Matter\" and it was often said as a direct response. Like Tom would say, \"Hey, Black Lives Matter\" and then Dan would say, \"Blue Lives Matter.\"\n\nSo in the context of the situation, this is all shorthand for:\n\n\"I think police kill black people too often. It's disturbing.\"\n\n\"Police have a right to survive their shift, and if that means occasionally some black people get killed if the cop feels like he's in danger, then so be it.\"\n\nAnd you can kind of see how in that context, yeah it comes off as kind of racist. Because the underlying message is something like, \"If I have to choose between a black person's life and a cop's life, I'm going to choose the cop every time\" which devalues the lives of black people and says that cop lives matter more than the lives of black people.",
            "Welll first things first, there\u2019s no such thing as a blue life, so jot that down",
            "Saying \"Blue Lives Matter\" in opposition to \"Black Lives Matter\" is eerily similar to those that say \"White Power\" in opposition Civil Rights marches saying \"Black Power\".\n\nSide note; Where were the right wing Blue Lives Matter screamers when law enforcement officers were being beaten up at the Capitol on January 6.",
            "if you wrote on the rock, just say that \ud83e\udd23",
            "Yes. Black Lives Matter is about holding police accountable for violence and brutality directed at citizens, in particular black people. Blue Lives Matter is about not doing that.",
            "In a vacuum, it wouldn't be. Saying \"Blue lives matter\" would mean \"the lives of police officers matter and we should support the police\".\n\nBut we don't live in a vacuum. Indeed, saying \"blue lives matter\" is said almost exclusively in response to someone saying \"black lives matter\", like people only ever say \"male rape victims exist\" *in response* to efforts to support female rape victims. This means \"blue lives matter\" isn't so much a statement of its own, but a bludgeon used to snuff out any discussion about systemic embedded racism inside the police force.",

            "The phrase \"blue lives matter\" is intended to drown out \"Black lives matter\" and defend cops against a movement designed to abolish police brutality. It's antagonistic.\n\n\"All lives matter\" is the same way. It was coined to shut down BLM, even if some people use it naively.",
            "Because blue lives matter was only created as a counter to black lives matter I'd say the answer is probably yes.",
            "\"blue lives matter\" is explicitly a response to \"black lives matter\". It is, at its most well meaning, a distraction from issues of racial injustice, and is at worst explicitly racist.",
            "I\u2019ll say, no, it\u2019s not inherently racist, but the general ideology behind people who use this phrase is VERY racist (being that this is essentially stating the exact opposite of \u201cblack lives matter\u201d).  As an example, you would never find someone supporting  BOTH \u201cblack lives matter\u201d AND \u201cblue lives matter\u201d as causes.",

            "It's not that the words are racist, but the people who say it are saying it with hate. \n\nBlack Lives Matter isn't being said because they matter more. It's being said because people don't seem to think they matter. They're the lived in danger. It's like if a house was on fire and you said \"save my house\" and someone else said \"well why aren't you saving my house\" when their house isn't on fire.\n\nBlue Lives Matter is even sillier. Everyone values police Lives. There are movies and shows entirely about how a cop killer always gets fucked up for killing a cop. No one is killing cops. But cops are factually killing black men at an alarming rate. \n\nIt's being said to undermine the lives of the black men being shot dead at traffic stops, while going for a walk, while in their own homes... it's saying \"I side with the cops *instead* of the victim\". \n\nYou can respect cops and still want change. I do.",
            "Contextually, it gained popularity after the black lives matter movement which was protesting police killings of unarmed young black men. So in the sense that it was an immediate response to that, it can certainly be a trigger for some. Same with \"thin blue line\" referring to police as well (those black and white flags with one blue stripe).\n\nAlso it used almost exclusively by people who are intent on belittling the BLM movement and their frustrations. As if Black Lives *don't* Matter, Blue Ones do. That is how many see it at least.\n\nI do support BLM so I tried to be as neutral as possible. I'm sure you're going to get a lot of... wrong? answers. What I wrote is probably as clear of an explanation as possible without getting into A LOT of very contentious issues surrounding race, police, justice, politics etc.",
            "Yes. It's a response to Black Lives Matter, and it's meant to diminish that. There is no possible reasoning for promoting \"blue lives matter\" that doesn't involve racism.\n\nThat said, I have no comment on \"exposing racists\", and I hesitate to endorse any long term or permanent negative action against minors.",

            "It is:\n\nBecause the phrase is in exact juxtaposition with a similar phrase that actually describes an actual \u201crace\u201d of people. You can not choose whether or not to be born black. You CAN however choose to be a police officer.",
            "It means you're an idiot.  You're like the people that fly the \"rebel\" flag because you think you're a rebel.  You don't realize you're being used as a political tool....specifically against black people.\n\nBut yeah, it's mostly racists.",
            "No - it\u2019s what\u2019s called a racist dog whistle. A non racist term colloquially used by people against the black American civil rights movement known as Black Lives Matter.",
            "I've heard it said like this:\n\nIf your house is burning down, and you need help, you're saying \"my house matters\"... It's literally under threat.\n\nNow your neigher walks by, whose house is NOT on fire, he/she might start yelling \"my house matters too!\"\n\nIn the second scenario, there is no threat and no danger to the house, so it's virtually wasted effort with potential to distract from the burning house.",
            "100% racist as \u201c Blue Lives Matter \u201c is a racist counter to Black Lives Matter as everytime civil rights issues came up concerning black folks racist people bring up things like that Blue Lives Matter or \u201c Black On Black crime \u201c when in reality crime for the most part has never been about race as 90% of white people are killed by other white people which makes it more about proximity. Also when you consider the fact that the Police were literally once \u201cRun Away Slave Patrol\u201d then you see where people who call it racist are coming from. Also the term was created by Conservatives who oppose the BLM movement and who call everyone \u201c Antifa \u201c , this was also created through \u201c Copaganda \u201c which is the idea that cops are heroes making a sacrifice to protect citizens \nwhen in reality Cops are regular people like everyone else who have to work for living and yes their job can get dangerous but end of the day they\u2019re not heroes.",
            "As with everything, it depends on intent.  If you have family that serve as police and your intent is to support them than not racist.  If you say it because you hate people proving cops are killing unarmed black people at an alarming rate and you are ok with that, then your intentions are racist so yes",
            "Can you tell me wtf a blue life is?",
            "The best explanation Ive heard is \"save the Wales\" doesn't mean \"fuck all the other sea life\" or \"kill dolphins\". Blue lives matter is a direct stab at black people, we know they matter. Yes all lives matter.  But that's not the point, Black Lives Matter is because they are getting killed by cops on video on a regular basis and it needs to stop. So, because of its introduction by Republicans/Racists, it is indeed racist.",
            "I personally don\u2019t think it is racist but to be fair it was created as a response to the original Black Lives Matter slogan. Saying Blue Lives Matter usually generates negative responses from people.",
            "You can say both black lives matter and blue lives matter together and they both are valid phrases. I'm law enforcement myself. Of course I think blue lives matter, because at the end of the day, your job choice doesn't negate the fact that your life matters.\n\nThe problem is that a lot of the issues that plague \"blue\" lives are because of direct abuse of the position of power that comes with the job. That abuse endangers the ones who just do their job because it paints them in a negative light. This is something that Black lives matter addresses and has ideas to work to fix them.\n\nI support the Black Lives Matter movement. Police reform will reduce negative interactions with police. Weeding out the bad cops will only do great things for both sides. Making the job safer for both sides. Less tension. I fully support fixing our laws, improving our judicial system, and holding officers accountable for their actions. If I use my taser, it better be for a good reason.\n\nAt the end of the day, the phrase isn't racist, you can even support the ideals of the movement of blue lives matter and not be racist. But when its directly used as an opposition to black lives matter, it is racist because your problem there is with the word black. \n\nI will proudly have my car adorned with a black lives matter sticker in addition to my thin blue line sticker.",
            "There\u2019s a guy on my street who flies the blue lives matter flag and has a sign with the flag on that says, \u201cI support law and order.\u201d\n\nAll I can think is, \u201cWhat do you think everyone else supports? Anarchy? You think we just want all the systems that keep us mostly safe and mostly content to go away? You think the rest of us want war? Lawlessness?\u201d\n\nWhat he is saying is, \u201cIn this debate where taking a side means thinking the police could do a better job at not killing people or thinking that the police are doing a fine job and everybody needs to lay off the criticism, I choose the side of saying that everything is fine. Nothing needs to change. I\u2019m okay with a militarized police force that routinely maims and kills and gets away with it the vast majority of the time. I don\u2019t think there needs to be more accountability. I think anyone protesting the police should shut up and go home.\u201d\n\nHis opinion is maliciously racist at worst and maliciously selfish at best. Does he think of himself as racist? I don\u2019t know. But he\u2019s a white dude with a nice job and a nice house in a nice neighborhood who doesn\u2019t have to worry about much of anything. His needs are met.\n\nHe could have chosen to stay out of the debate. He could have put up no flags, no signs. But he chose to publicly advertise his opinion. He is informed enough to know what Blue Lives Matter means. Anyone who flies that flag has a personal responsibility to know what they are supporting.\n\nSo yeah, I think the guy is racist.",
            "Of course not.  Some people say \"Blue Lives Matter\" because there's a big generalization that all cops are racist.  It also notes the stress of the job, versus the encouragement of disrespecting all cops.  Black Lives Matters is spoken because people in a minority are sick of seeing black people shot by cops.  I'm more the type to question why the news only shows black people being murdered.   Everybody is handling their shit poorly.  We got to make a better future, but this strict divide is being manipulated. A manipulation just so some fool can get elected.",
            "No, it is not.",
            "No, there\u2019s nothing inherently racist about saying Blue Lives Matter.  I think most Blue Lives Matter people would agree that black lives matter and most BLM people would agree that blue lives matter. Their opposition is over a question of fact: are blacks disproportionately killed and otherwise mistreated by police. BLM would say yes. Blue Lives Matter would say no. And of course there are studies that support both sides.",
            "Saying blue lives matter is not racist",
            "Not necessarily.  But there is a pretty big overlap between racists and the people who love the slogan.",

            "No it is not racist. It's a phrase used to show support for police who have been attacked in every way possible and been unable to do their job which is ultimately protecting the public. I would be wary of anyone who feels the need to call things racist which are not obviously so. There are certainly racist people in the world but there are many more being painted as such because it is a convenient way to attack others and harder to disprove even with no evidence of the claim.",
            "How? The police force is made up of all genders with diverse ethnic backgrounds",
            "I don't think any term like it, including black live matter, should exist. Except for all lives matter, and everyone just needs to grow the fuck up and realize that no matter what skin color, gender, or age you are, your life matters.",
            "No.",
            "No. Racism is a thought crime. Almost nothing is by default racist or not racist, you have to know the thoughts, context around it. You have to know what is going on in a person's head to really know for sure.",
            "The short answer is yes. \n\nBut it\u2019s much more complicated. See, most people that say \u201cblue lives matter\u201d are not racist. Most cops aren\u2019t proactively racist, but the majority of police are forced to turn a blind eye to racism exhibited by their fellow officers. \n\n\u201cBlue lives matter\u201d is a response to \u201cBlack Lives Matter.\u201d The original intent of BLM was to say, \u201chey, Black Lives Matter too, stop shooting black people as if they don\u2019t have intrinsic value.\u201d Then racist white men chose to interpret the slogan as \u201cOnly Black Lives Matter.\u201d We all know that all lives matter. But not all people are summarily executed by the police without accountability. The majority of people (relative to the entire population size of any racial group) being abused and killed by police were black. So the slogan was created to draw attention to this atrocity that was not being given due recognition. Then, people started to turn their anger towards the police since the news was highlighting every incident of police on black killing. The truth of the matter is that black people shoot and kill other black people at waaaaay higher rates than that of police shooting and killing black people. But that\u2019s a separate conversation. \n\nWhen police started to feel the tide turning against them, they banded together and came up with \u201cblue lives matter.\u201d  The statement in and of itself is true. The lives of police officers do in fact matter. Just like the lives of teachers, and grocery store employees, and mechanics\u2019 lives all matter. But you don\u2019t hear mechanics and grocery store workers chiming in with slogans of their own. That\u2019s because they aren\u2019t part of the discussion. The discussion is about police abusing their authority out of fear and/or racism. Black men are disproportionately shot by police officers. In fact, police officers shoot way more people of different races than they do black men, but as a percentage of the population size, they shoot waaaay more black men. There\u2019s a reason for that too, but again, it\u2019s a completely different topic. So, because the police adopted a slogan that was used by black people to highlight abuses perpetrated by the police against black people, they created a greater degree of hostility from the black community. It became an inflammatory thing to say. The police didn\u2019t seem to retrain their officers in deescalation tactics, they didn\u2019t focus on building a relationship with the black community, but they actively went about dismissing the point of the BLM movement. They stole a slogan in order to protest the community of people who they have been systematically abusing from the very beginning. They didn\u2019t own up to the fact that they treat black people worse than other ethnic groups. They simple dismissed the criticism and doubled down. So now, if someone says \u201cblue lives matter,\u201d they are likely to be seen as a racist because of the context in which the phrase was originated. \n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that most people have a limited capacity when it comes to thinking. It\u2019s difficult for most people to hold two competing and contradictory thoughts in their heads at the same time. People who understand context and history definitely do agree that saying \u201cblue lives matter\u201d is racist. Simple-minded people think it\u2019s not racist because they are removing context from the equation. They literally think \u201cbut blue lives do matter.\u201d  Of course they matter. Most police officers are awesome humans. They deal with the drudgery of life day in and day out. They deal with the worst among us so that we don\u2019t have to. They are literally heroes. However, pretending that a problem doesn\u2019t exist not only doesn\u2019t solve the problem, but it often makes it worse in the long run. So, to act as if the epidemic of police officers shooting and killing black people isn\u2019t a problematic, is itself a problem. I don\u2019t expect a white person to recognize the problem, because they aren\u2019t affected by the problem. Their kids aren\u2019t affected by the problem. But if cops shot and killed the same proportional number of white people as they do black people, well, that would be intolerable to white people and there would be a movement to solve the problem. The simpletons of the world think that the slogan exists in a vacuum, and because most police officers are good (this is highly debatable), the slogan is fine. But they\u2019re being cognitively dissonant with reality, given the context. \n\nWell, I was very long-winded, but I hope you understand the context, so as to understand why saying \u201cblue lives matter\u201d is interpreted as racist.",
            "No Lives matter. I read a shitload of comments waiting for this response but haven\u2019t found it. So I\u2019ll say it. As long as we\u2019re in the system that we\u2019re in, no lives fucking matter. Maybe to your family and friends you mean something and they mean a great deal to you. But on a larger scale and in a bigger picture of reality, unless you are an elite member of society, your life doesn\u2019t matter. It is the powers that be and the media, turning us against each other to distract the populace from the evils being done to us all. There are certainly some undeniable hardships presented to the African American community. But by putting racial groups against each other, the higher socio-economic class is running with this narrative to divide regular people and keep us from addressing the greater issue at hand.",
            "Not at all racist. Imagine living in a blue little house and having a blue corvette and everyone and everything and everyone around you is blue but still someone says your life doesn't matter. I would not like to live in that blue little world",
            "We all need cops, and some good people are cops",
            "Blue lives matter is a racist statement.  Straight up.  There isn't any way around this.\n\nBlue Lives Matter and All Lives Matter are simply racist responses meant to counter Black Lives Matter.  Racists attempt to drown out legitimate issues with 'moral high ground' statements.  They know damn well what they are trying to do, but can claim ignorance to it and try to argue that they are taking the higher road when really they are being deceptive creeps.\n\nNot only is Blue Lives Matter and All Lives Matter racist, they are also anti-Christian. Luke 15:4-7 and Matthew 18:10-14.  These parables direct any true Christian to identify those that are preyed upon, save them, and rejoice in the task of doing so.  Ignoring the issues behind Black Lives Matter and trying to drown them out with comments about All Lives matter or Blue Lives Matter is simply sacrilege.\n\nOn top of all that, there is no such thing as blue lives.  No one has blue skin (except Paul Karason, but he sadly passed away).  So unless you are specifically talking about people Argyria (and I'm not aware of anyone oppressing these folks), you're blowing smoke out your ass.  Cops choose their line of work.  If they have a problem doing their job, well, they can quit.",
            "Yes. Black Lives Matter originated as a response to the alarmingly higher and disproportionate rate of black people killed by police compared to that of whites, while the violent crime rate for black vs white offenders does not scale similarly. \n\nBlue/all lives matter originated as a denial/dismissal of this phenomenon.\n\n2019 Statistics:\n\n- 370 whites killed by police = 0.000148% of white population \n\n- 235 blacks killed by police = 0.000534% of black population. This rate is 3.6x higher.\n\n- White violent crime rate: 1.07%\n\n- Black violent crime rate: 1.1%. This rate is 1.03x higher.\n\nWe are looking at a 3.6x higher death by cop rate vs a 1.03x higher violent crime rate.",
            "There is statically an issue with black people being murdered, arrested, jailed or sentenced to death at higher rates than other groups.\n\nBlack activists used the statement \u201cblack lives matter\u201d to highlight these issues.\n\nRather than saying or thinking, yes, black lives do matter, too. People responded with, all lives matter and blue lives matter. \n\nThere is no disproportionate issue amongst police or \u201call lives\u201d, so what motivates someone to say these things in response?\n\nIn my mind I can only rationalise that they are stupid and/or racist.",
            "I\u2019d say it\u2019s mocking the Black Lives Matter slogan so yes it\u2019s racist.",
            "Nine times out of ten anyone saying \"Blue Lives Matter\" is using that phrase as a PC stand-in for saying \"Black Lives Don't Matter\"  \n\n\nBlue Lives Matter started as a counter-effort to Black Lives Matter.  Black Lives Matter was demanding that police be held accountable for the abundant abuses and even murders of black Americans.  Blue Lives Matter emerged afterwards as a way of very literally declaring that the police have the right to abuse and murder whoever they want at will and that we the citizen should never question them or establish any oversight.  The movement grew in popularity among Neo-Confederates and Klansmen who saw the police as the front lines in the race war.  \n\n\nNowadays the type of person with a Blue Lives Matter flag displayed will usually have a Confederate Flag, Gadsden Flag, or Trump Flag right next to it.  The movement is almost exclusively associated with racists and fascists since its entire political stance declares police to be above the law and people of color to deserve their abuse.  On January 6th people carrying Blue Lives Matter flags were beating police officers to death for standing in their way, because at the end of the day their movement was never actually about the blue lives at all.",
            "Well, unless someone is racist towards Smurfs and Avatars, this is the true BLM!!!",
            "People have short memories. Both Black Lives Matter and Blue Lives Matter existed long before the past few years. \n\nBlue Lives Matter was created in response to perceived ill will directed towards police (particularly from the media).\n\nBlack Lives Matter was created as a response to perceived? ill will directed towards the black community.\n\nContrary to what you\u2019ll read in this thread - neither is actually directly related to the others creation. Thing is, BLM became more active after Floyd (for obvious reasons). This caused animosity towards police which led to an uptick/revival of Blue Lives Matter.\n\nOverall - it all comes down to intent. \n\nA politician can say Black Lives Matter every four years to gather votes, only to keep the black community down. They said the right things, but they don\u2019t think Black Lives Matter. The black community has seen Democrats do this all the time. \n\nA person can say All lives matter and earnestly strive to right the wrongs done to the black community. Because they believe the rode to the future is what binds us together, not what separates us.\n\nAnother person can say All Lives Matter to dismiss someone who says BLM.\n\nA person can say Blue Lives Matter to support police. Imagine a spouse of a police officer seeing the vitriol and hatred their SO faces everyday on the news. They might want people to think their SO\u2019s life matters.\n\nPerspective and intent is important. We just love to straw man and group everyone into neat little packages.\n\nIt\u2019s hilarious how these petty arguments over BLM, BlueLM, and ALM just feed division and add fuel to the fire.\n\nIf you\u2019re a BLM speaker, If you hear someone say ALM\u2026 say all lives do indeed matter! But, I\u2019m currently concerned and focused on a few issues the black community is facing - I think by addressing this we can really makes ALM mean something.\n\nIf you\u2019re ALM preacher. If you hear someone say BLM\u2026 say black lives sure do matter. When I say ALM it\u2019s a goal - not a reality. Let\u2019s do something to reach that goal.\n\nIf you\u2019re a BlueLM person. If you hear someone say BLM. Realize this is not a personal attack but an expression of anger, fear, and hurt. Black Lives do matter! I\u2019m not your enemy - I can\u2019t do any real change. I\u2019m but a scapegoat that people in charge have offered. Let\u2019s work together to make a change we can all believe in.\n\nTldr: Racism is all about intent. We don\u2019t know people\u2019s true intent. Stop creating other people\u2019s thoughts and arguments and actually do something to lift another human being up.

Those that don\u2019t understand how cancerous making up context and intent is to society make for a majority of modern hate and bigotry hidden behind fake righteousness and condescension. \n\nThe person claiming racism is the problem. They need to substantiate the racism with facts by asking the person their intent, not arbitrarily say it\u2019s racism to be inflammatory and divisive just because they don\u2019t like something. Not agreeing with something does not make it hate or racism. It shows a blatant lack of respect for everyone around you if you go around assigning intent and context to everyone you see.

            "To put it as simply as possible: The reason why BLM (which is what started the \u201clives matter movement\u201d) began, is because black people have been systemically oppressed for a long time (ever since they were brought to the country as slaves). To *counter* their movement and say \u201cAll/Blue lives matter\u201d seems to divert from the issue that an oppressed group of people are trying to be heard. \nConsider this: \nIf your significant other/ family member came up to you (In obvious distress) and asked \u201cdo you love me?\u201d, an answer of \u201cI love everyone\u201d would be truthful, but hurtful.",
            "No, it isn't racist.  It is politics. You're always going to meet the extremes and not the rational neutrals that don't care enough to focus on it all. You're going to get the people that are police officers or family members of police officers that deal with their struggles, then You're going to get the people that have their own struggles or even fear from police authority abuse which has been largely correlated as a race issue (we have evidence that isn't always the case, but it is largely the case thus the argument). \n\n\nThis however has a confederate flag issue. You have multiple demographics with different background and experiences with the issue. You have on one hand the origin,  which absolutely came up solely to counter against another movement, then you have the handful that was exposed to it and adopt it with no malicious intent with no bad faith practicing the symbol. These are the type of things where a sit down is in order, but instead someone is gonna adopt the symbol as a part of their identity and culture simply because the other side will be toxic and unreasonable rather than cooperative or sympathetic because of an entirely more vocal and publicly more present demographic uses the symbol entirely out of bad faith. This is what happens with politics, you have two stubborn groups with sound arguments, but they're not ready to hear the other because of personal experiences. \n\n\nIt is a swastika situation in my opinion.  It might not be your intentions to be racist or offend, but sometimes you don't get to decide what symbols mean in public. You can absolutely not care about how others will react to it, that is your choice, but you gotta ask yourself what the purpose of the symbol was in the first place, whether it is your way to publicly express your identity or to give yourself an uphill battle to fight for your identity. Chances are, you're not going to have swastikas on your vehicle to assert good luck to yourself and others, you know that isn't what it means to people anymore, but maybe you could compromise and put a series of dots around the swastika or even revert it so people know it is of no association (nevermind the fact the mirrored version technically means something else, they're considered interchangeable now because of the nazis lol). So like how I feel the southerners need a new symbol, I think anyone that sincerely believes there are good cops or they are good cops and want to establish a movement around that idea, maybe do so in a way that distances themselves from the bad cops trying to use the phrase to silence doubt, skepticism, or criticism of police officers and politics around them. \n\n\nI do sincerely believe there are good cops, I do believe they matter as human beings, but the implocation behind specifically \"blue lives matter\", in spite not being racist in most contexts, it will he interpreted as racist anyway by most people. What is English for if it isn't to clearly assert ideas? What are symbols for if they're not to visually declare your goals or intentions in a clear way without any room for misinterpretation or perspectives ? Choose your battles.",

Police are given guns to carry around, police will shoot a black person for having a gun, police can get away with murder, and when police do die, they have a fancy funeral paid for by the state.\n\nIf you are saying black lives matter, you are trying to end racism by the police.

            "Industry performer here - Stunt dept.\n\nWhen we do things with animals that involve yelling or screaming like a dog bite attack etc, we're told not to yell or scream, just do the motions and they will record and add the sound over it later. So likely what you saw, when it was filmed the actor was just motioning to the dog without sound and the animal handler was offscreen giving instructions to the dog like pout, snarl, etc. Then later the actor went into a sound booth and recorded the yelling dialogue.\n\nEdit: Wow, I didn't expect this to go viral. Thanks everyone, glad I could ease your minds. Yes nobody wants to scare an animal on set. Even down to spiders. That scene in Home Alone where he had the spider on his face, he faked screaming as not to scare the animal. Then recorded it after.\n\nI had a Ram (sheep with horns) run into me on a show once. That animal was really nice and I was supposed to be \"taunting\" it and then it runs into me. The animal handler just told me to dance around but don't move towards the animal and don't say anything. Then he stood behind me and honked a horn and when he did the Ram ran at me and hit my pads. Then afterwards the ram was given some treats and that was that.\n\nEDIT 2: OK, after a bunch of PM's asking to see the video of me getting hit by the Ram. I uploaded it.

We taught him a trick where whenever we say \"ow\" repeatedly he comes over and jumps up for face licks. He knows we aren't actually being hurt, as when we get hurt he barks at us, but he knows how to respond to humans acting with more acting. I can only imagine this is what acting dogs do. Also the guy yelling at the dog probably gives the dog some pets and a treat after the cut.\nAlso to the person saying dogs are unintelligent, no they aren't. They do have complex emotions, and they can do pretty smart things. My dog sees me on my phone instead of petting him and so when I put it down he goes and lays down on it, and he hides my jackets so I can't leave the house when I get home and my parents are gone.

Bears and wolves don't differentiate between growling for a film and growling for real. \n\nSo it's much easier to train these animals to silently mimick the aggressive emotions rather than actually becoming aggressive, and then trying to calm them down before another take. \n\nAs for dogs, I'd imagine it's the same.",

As it was one of her habits she tought him to bark at everyone and everything approaching our front door. So the Padawan learned from his master that he has to run to the door and bark as soon as they hear anything getting close.\n\nYears pass, they bark and bark and bark. And Lord Dachshund is becoming deaf. After a while she doesn\u2019t hear anything at all. After a little while the young Boi is getting a bit chubby so my parents decide to put him on a diet. And then we observed something that was really shocking and I swear it\u2019s the truth. \n\nWhen they got their Dinner, mr chubby basically inhaled his smaller portion, put his head up like he was getting surprised and ran to the door in a hectic manner. He barked, obv., but that was not the point. Ol Ms Dachshund saw his reaction, assumed someone must have been at the door and followed him to the door, barking like a Yeti would ram at the door. Hence no one was there.\n\nLil Boi, the evil mastermind he is, snuck back to their eating place and ate all of her food as fast as he could. \n\nUp until this day I\u2019m convinced he planned and executed all of this stage play. \n\nTake it like you want, but it\u2019s a good day to tell a story about dogs.",

It's a normal social behavior, but I think it's meaningful to recognize that they appear to understand it at some level.\n\nThey understand how to act honestly, and how to sneak around, and how to stare at the wall to look inconspicuous when you know they did something and they know you know but they are going to pretend.\n\nSo while they're not stage actors, I think at least some dog actors get it, at the very least that \"this is play, we're playing, this isn't a normal thing, this is a game\"",

            "First you need to explain to a dog what a movie is. Then explain the role of the people who are in movies to explain what the concept of acting is. Then you would need to get the dog to agree to do the same. \n\nI don't think there's a dog in the history of the world that has been able to understand these concepts. Don't get me wrong, I think animals are smart. But probably not anywhere close to this degree.",

In rehearsal we wanted the dog to go up to the villain of the play and basically jump up and bounce off of his chest to make it seem like he saved the day. Only problem was the actor had a fake knife that the dog actor thought was real so every time he\u2019d take the command to go up to the score he\u2019d immediately start growling and would stop listening to commands.

If they can smell you, they might [be able to](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/yes-dogs-can-catch-their-owners-emotions) (btw I can't read this article all the way but the takeaway is that they can smell some emotions). Otherwise, they can refer to facial expressions and [tone of voice](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-dogs-emotions/dogs-can-read-human-emotions-idUSKCN0VP1DH). So if they're not close enough to the actor, they may rely on the expressions and tone of voice and they might as well think something is wrong.\n\nHowever, some things you can keep in mind. Some dogs, like police dogs or guard dogs, are trained to work in adversarial and stressful situations, and they're able to stay focused on their \"job.\" So that may be similar to a dog and the handler on a set. And in movie making, they can do a lot of deceptive things. As another commenter mentioned, actors can pantomime yelling and add the sound in post. You may notice jump cuts between the actor and the dog, e.g. they're not literally in the same frame during the action like yelling (this happens a lot in fights scenes so they can do everything separately and in small parts).\n\nBut yeah, even though there are good productions, sometimes there are productions that aren't protective enough about animals like that Seal Team comment said. Movies can be so hectic that the production just doesn't give a crap about animal welfare and view the animals merely as a means to an end. It looks like there's a [longer list](https://www.nbc26.com/news/national/10-popular-movies-that-faced-claims-of-animal-abuse) than I would have hoped for, and that the [AHA is at least](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/animals-were-harmed-hollywood-reporter-investigation-on-set-injury-death-cover-ups-659556/) one animal welfare representative overseeing animal abuse.",

It isn't fun for me if everyone is raging all the time, and there's just too much of that in online gaming. \n\nI always loved the idea of massive online gaming. When it was a new thing, I got into it a bit. That's when I quickly realized that the idea of it was much better than the reality of it. People act like assholes when they can hide behind anonymity and they know there aren't any real consequences. Even in a non-violent game like a racing sim, you end up having people screaming racial slurs and all manner of other crap. It really sucks that so much of gaming has moved towards this model, without developing any real ways to limit the bad actors. \n\nThat's why I pretty much just stick to story mode and story-based, single player games these days.

You\u2019ll very rarely pick up a game and be above average right away \n\nAt the same time you have to own the fact that you\u2019re learning. If it\u2019s a team game, you\u2019re gonna be the weak link the first few times, but don\u2019t even bother telling them you\u2019re new. Fake it till you make it. \n\nIf you die and can spectate someone else, pay really close attention to how they play and communicate within a team structure and try to emulate that. \n\nPeople will be mean.

I like to imagine every time I get trash talked, it\u2019s a 38 year old in a dingy basement surrounded by trash.

            "I fee that, though only really with team based cooperative games. Something like Mario Kart, where the other people aren't really much different from bots (since no teams and 0 communication), I'm perfectly fine with. But something like Apex, or any sort of MMO, where being on a team is required either to accomplish something, or play at all, is not for me. I don't want to communicate with random people, I don't like having to work with people to do something in a game, and I don't like them having to work with me (because I'm not very good at games). \n\nIf I had friends who played those types of online games, I'd be fine to team-up/party with them, but I don't find playing with random people online appealing at all. Even if most people aren't toxic, I just don't want to have the stress of interacting with people I don't know, when games are what I do to relax.",

Half the times, you are playing with idiots with a huge ego or dunning effect\n\nThe other half is just playing with luck. Luck that hopefully you either win or lose with those idiots\n\nIn any case, that % is applied to them and you.\n\nAlso no one cares online who or what you did.

Deep Rock Galactic is players vs. environment, and the community overwhelmingly supports and loves me players, and they will publicly shame anyone that they catch being mean to someone, no matter how experienced that person might be. \n\nCo-op in player vs environment just generally breeds that sense of comradary that makes people behave nicer to one another.

I dunno where parents fucked up to teach that. \n\nI learned good sportsmanship was the assumption you're all there to learn, do your best and develop solidarity. Y'know, be nice.

Stuff like this happens every game and its the only multiplayer game where I can have fun, in other games I am the quiet hermet that hates interacting with people unless its totally necessary.",
            "Depends a lot. If you\u2019re playing a competitive game with smaller teams like csgo, valorant, RSS and a few more, or with bigger teams like battlefield and all those, then I think this is something that happens to everyone. I started playing minecraft when I was 8 or so and knew how to use computers before then and around the age of 9 or 10 I think I started playing TF2 which later lead me to csgo and later on valorant, Star Wars battlefront 2 and a few other games. What I\u2019ve learnt is in games with bigger teams there\u2019s usually less communication because having team-VC in a game with big teams is usually a big mess. In games with smaller teams like csgo and valorant communication is key, you will have bad games and good games. Toxicity is something you will run into at some point but it doesn\u2019t get any of you, anywhere and it can just ruin everyone\u2019s day so if you shit talk someone in VC apologise after you\u2019ve calmed down a bit cause it can help and lead to a win. If you cause the loss, sure there\u2019ll be fingers pointing at you but I recommend playing with either other players you meet in game or with friends that also play. This\u2019ll lead to less toxicity and more communication which will result in you performing better and more consistently in most cases. Don\u2019t play with people that are usually toxic and \u201ccausing\u201d the loss is usually not something you should worry about especially if there\u2019s toxic players on your team because their toxicity will only worsen everyone\u2019s performance and give everyone will get a bad experience out of it. There\u2019s also the times where you actually may be the reason you lost but don\u2019t take it too hard because it\u2019s a learning experience and most players have at some point made mistakes that they also used to get better and in they just learned something they didn\u2019t know before. In most small team competitive games there\u2019ll also be other modes that can be good to practice, warm up and get better in like death match, casual or unrated as well as practise range and custom mode. \n\nIf you can\u2019t hear your team in voice chat but see their names popping up with a speaker next to it, it\u2019s usually a very easy fix and all you need to do most of the time is just change what input you have for sounds in game.\n\nGames with bigger teams like battlefield, SWBF2 and a lot more are generally more chill in my experience and communication isn\u2019t as important. That said I don\u2019t have a whole lot of experience with a lot of these games because they\u2019re usually more expensive and harder to run.\n\nAs always there\u2019ll be cheaters that you don\u2019t need to be scared of. They can be annoying and you might get mad which is probably the common reaction if they kill you. They can also be good entertainment especially if they\u2019re on your team and they start raging because either the other team has a player that\u2019s better than them and kills them all the time so they can\u2019t show off what hack they spent the rest of their life savings getting (one of my personal favourites) or the other team has a player who\u2019s got better software than your teammate has and generally this is also a fun experience because they\u2019ll rage (can also be good entertainment.) Some cheaters are of course also very arrogant, think they\u2019re the best and will scream at you if you mention that they\u2019re cheating which is fairly obvious sometimes. There\u2019s also the cool ones (the only ones I usually like to play with) who only cheat in custom games with friends.\n\nIf you\u2019re playing competitively and feel like you\u2019re not performing as well as you could or you just had a game with a toxic player that brought you down, take a break and a breather to get back to normal. It helps a lot and going on will usually just ruin your game experience and you\u2019ll be performing worse.",

Either that I need to make cool responses or comments, that I will be bothered to play all the time in the future, but most of all I fear that I'll hurt someone's feelings or offend them somehow.

But I quickly tired of the frenetic pace and shooting, spawn, running around game play with people who were so serious about it. I play to relax after a day of work. I don't need something to extend my stress into the evening and pump more cortisol into my blood and work my already taxed adrenal glands. So I like just playing against the computer at my own pace.",

I recently found out he tends to either play with his siblings if it\u2019s with other people or on his own against the computer because he\u2019s just there to have fun and not get talked negatively to or berated if he sucks.

            "you have no ideea how many people suck at games , actually 30 percent of all online gamers are the lowest ranking , in every video game , for a game to have 100k concurrent players, 30000 people suck at the game , you are not alone , game are mad so you fight with levels of skill that are basically the same at the lowest rank , that you are going to be if you try to play . So the chances to be bad at the game are very low , and even if you lose , it's your one of the first games , you lack confidence , but if you played the offline version multiple times , you are already at the top 90 percent of that 30%",

            "Yep! There are some games where I avoid voice chat at all costs because once people here my female voice, I either get shit on or sexualized. In WoW, (which is kind of different) I have a fantastic guild and chat with them constantly. There are several other women in the guild as well, far more than the guilds I\u2019ve been a part of in the past, and the GM and officers have worked really hard to foster a positive and drama-free environment. In some games, I practiced repeatedly in AI mode until I felt \u201csafe\u201d doing it with real humans as the opposition, or I waited until I had a buddy with me who could give me tips and real-time instructions until I felt like I knew what I was doing. \n\nUltimately, though, some people are going to be dicks no matter what.

Love 'em.\n\nI've played various multiplayer games since the 90's and it wasn't until the 2010's that I really stopped and went almost purely single-player.\n\nThe players, in my opinion, have either gotten much worse over time, or I've gotten older and just outgrown it, over time. There is this culture of \"K!LL Y0URS3LF!\" that is just so persistent in most multiplayer and mmo-style games that I just can't enjoy. Maybe I just need to 'git gud'...",
            "I play call of duty and madden online and my fiance loves talking and listening to other people but I hate it. So I turned it off.  I still get the challenge of playing against other people but the anxiety is WAY lower and it is really only a benefit for me.",
            "I can relate. Didn\u2019t grow up playing online FPS so I naturally suck at them. But I got really into Destiny 2 at one point and to get better specific gear, the game forced you to play online competitive PVP where people take the game way too seriously. Wasn\u2019t fun getting a .03 KD and having my team message me that I suck. But over time (a long time), I got a lot better and eventually could carry a team. Point is though that everyone sucks when they first start playing. But it\u2019s a game, you\u2019re just meant to have fun. If you suck, who cares? If anyone messages you giving you grief or yells at you on voice chat, they\u2019re the asshole. And yea you\u2019re gonna have awkward encounters where you kinda just small talk with people. But it\u2019s not like you know them irl. Any awkward situations will never affect you in any meaningful way. So I would recommend trying online if that\u2019s what you want to do. Anxiety is tough to get around, but just remember that you\u2019ll never have to talk to any of the people you interact with online in the future.",
            "It doesn't make me anxious, it makes be bored. The thing about people is they'll win *at any cost*. Exploit every bug, clip through every corner, take advantage of every meta. Sure, winning is the point, but there comes a point where there's no variety and people are so sweaty to win, playing just isn't fun anymore.",
            "Give it a try. At worst you can always turn it off. It's only a game",
            "Your concern about letting the team down; almost all games use some matchmaking so you're playing with/against people near as good as you. Main point: you're going to be let down just as much as you let other people down. Everyone chokes, everyone fucks up, if your team gives you shit, ask them why they weren't there to help. There's also the fact that you failing is not always your fault. It could be your team not being there for you, miscommunication, unpredictable actions from the other team. And in the scenario where some random loser gets mad at you for something, your fault or not, you can respond however the hell you want, or not at all. It's the internet. If someone doesn't care about your feelings, stop giving a shit about theirs.\n\nAlso, if you want a zero pressure social experience online, vrchat is a low barrier to entry game, and trust me, half the people would also be on desktop mode. Another really fun social game would be SCP:SL. You need an hour long tutorial to know what the fuck you're doing, but you can be as goofy or as serious as you want, but the outcome doesn't matter and everyone's there to have fun so you won't have to worry about 'letting people down.' Usually if you think you've let someone down in a team game, they've probably let you down just as much.\n\nFinal note: you can only have fun in an online game if you're trying to. If you aren't in the mood for multiplayer, don't even try, it won't be as enjoyable.",

Virtually no one will be frustrated with you long enough that you sucking at the game will impact them. Even if they get mad at you, it's just a game, so they can fuck off.",

            "Really not silly at all. I tend to get really anxious playing online games. Back when I was a teenager I used to play online MP all the time, MW 1&2, Gears of War, FIFA, Halos, allsorts. I'd happily play for hours on end, always in game chat. The only time I ever got anxious back then was when I tried to play in more competitive matches through third party websites.\n\nI think part of the problem stems from the fact I was pretty good at all those games back then. Now whenever I come into a new game I expect myself to be good at it before even putting in the hours of practice needed to get to that level. Which is stupid. I get anxious about playing poorly and causing a loss, getting flamed by teammates for it (although I mostly turn chat off and don't go in game chat anymore).\n\nKind of tying into that I think the other part of the problem is that when a MP game has been out for a while, even if it looks great, I get put off from playing it because I just assume the player base will have got way too good and I'll just get slaughtered by everyone. Which just isn't the case, when I have braved going onto games like that, there's still plenty of people who are new to it, or just not very good still. An with modern matchmaking systems they do a great job of placing you in matches where it's most often fair.\n\nSo personally I only really play a couple of MP games anymore, but only ever a couple of games at a time due to performance anxiety. I do prefer single player games and play them a lot more. I'm no psychologist, but I do know that worrying about MP games in the way I do, getting anxious over my performance, wins/losses in just standard online matches isn't healthy. You should always first and foremost enjoy the process of playing, that's what games are all about.\n\nHope you can push yourself to try something like Among Us, because it's  a far more casual, friendly experience than others, as there's not normally any obviously right answer. So no one's gonna be too mad at you if you make a wrong call.",
            "Playing online just tends to be a wild ride for me, so they are a bit more exhausting than offline games mostly. Sometimes you just have bad teammates or can't work together,.

            "That's why games have started introducing a 'casual' mode and a 'competitive' mode. Casual games don't matter. They don't affect rank, they don't affect level, the games are less heated and well competitive . . . .\n\nSometimes they're even easier. You get more health, more time, more ammo etc etc.\n\nSo if they only have online competitive then I can for sure see being anxious, but I don't see a reason to be anxious about casual games.",

You play more, the more confident you will be and it'll be more fun!\n\n**You can also find friends at the same level as you and have even greater time playing!**\n\nTry making the anxious feeling be a feeling of excitement and a want to win.

If I decide to play an online fps or something similar I get burnt out quickly because of how taxing it is for me. Dont get me wrong, I love online fps style games, it just requires a lot more of, for lack of a better word, 'brain power'.",
            "The only games I'm kinda scared of playing online are 1v1 games like mortal kombat kinda because I feel pretty anxious of going against real people 1 on 1. But I still feel pretty confident to play team games, I don't care about winning or losing it doesn't matter to me",

            "I used to play WoW; sometimes there were just dungeons and raids and PvP maps I sucked at. Others, I was really, really good at and my guild relied on me fairly heavily. When you suck, you just gotta laugh about it. If people are taking the game so seriously that you ruin their day while trying to have fun with a game you enjoy\u2014that says far more about them than you.",

I am older (30-40 age group) and my reflexes are not as good as it was before and I just want to have fun when I am playing a game.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStop caring about the 'winning' part and just enjoy a game. Nothing happens if you lose or if you are not good at a game. You will not be good against players who can invest 100's hours in a game.",
            "I know the feeling. Sometimes you just have to jump in and learn to swim! I get anxious when people start calling me out (most time for no reason). I have found that the loudest, most uncommutative players are the worse ones. Just mute them and have fun.\n\nAt the end of the day, they are all video games meant for fun. Unless you are a professional player, don't take things too seriously and when you encounter players who do all you can do is brush it off.\n\nWith a game like Star Wars Battlefront, there are (I think) 60 player game modes where it is not really possible for you to be the sole cause of the loss. I suggest starting with games and game modes like that",

            "I had a few friends who were like this. Do you happen to be the youngest sibling? Lol, I'm joking, but apparently it does play a role. You probably stress too much about your performance, because you're not familiar with the process. I was like this when I first started playing online games. You could either try to get used to it if you find games that you absolutely want to play, or maybe online games aren't for you if the stress is not worth it. But the fact is, you're unconsciously giving too much attention to something that doesn't matter.",

            "I sometimes get anxious when I do something like competitive matchmaking, like in CS:GO or Overwatch, but for casual play I might focus but won't stress too much.  \nFor the game's your playing though, I can see where you're coming from. I've been playing racers ever since I could pick up a controller (Mario Kart was my first game, actually!), and I still find racing to be a bit stress-inducing because a single mistake could cost you the race.\n\nIf by Battlefront you mean Star Wars Battlefront 2, I have seen a few weirdos in the big PvP matches, but I find the co-op matches to be absolutely chill, since everyone's just messing around or just trying to level up heroes (which you can do regardless of loss or victory). If you have a few friends just queue up and it's just you against bots, tons of fun, way less stressful.\n\nOther users have already said their peace on Among Us, it's really a \"friends only\" type game. If you really want to there should be a \"free play\" mode where it's just you running around the map doing tasks so if you do eventually get a group going you won't be completely lost.",
            "TL;DR LoL is scary if you're new.\n\nI never really experienced anxiety while playing online until I started playing League of Legends with a buddy of mine... IT IS INTENSE.\n\n You have to pretty much already know everything about the game otherwise you get called out for every little thing. There is a humongous learning curve. It sucks there isn't a way to play with other people who are also learning.",
            "I play destiny a lot. \nI mostly play solo but some activities have to be done in groups. 98% of my time playing with randoms has been awesome. \nThe 2% I match with an A-hole , I just mute him.\nDefinitely depends on the game though. Destiny has a very healthy and helpful community .",

            "I play Destiny 2 and this is the hardest part for me. So many activities in the game require matchmaking, even if I could accomplish them alone, that's not always an option. I have the same concerns, but I try to force myself out of my shell every once in a while. I'll do one pvp or matchmade activity and then go play solo for a while until I feel up to going back into play with others.",
            "I feel this sometimes but not for those reasons. Online gaming has pretty much made me lost all hope for humanity seeing how braindead people behave, specially in South America servers. I think EU has this problem with Russians afaik?",
            "I've slowly stopped any online game that relies heavily on communication/voice coms over the last few years. I'm pretty good at a handful of those games (overwatch, CoD etc) but I just feel like my terrible social skills would make people feel awkard or bring down the party. Its probably not even true but a crippling anxiety non the less lol I don't mind playing online with coms off tho.\n\nIf I could say one thing to but you at ease, is that there are all types of games for all types of skill levels. Most games are made with everyone in mind these days. Everyone is aloud to make mistakes in gaming, thats how humanity learns.  There will be toxic people in some games, but they're gonna toxic/mad whether your there or not. Hope you feel free to play and enjoy yourself, but its okay to not play as well if find out you prefer single player stuff",
            "I just don't like twitch based high APM games anymore which is what 95% of online gaming is. The great skill gap is how high an APM you can manage. It's much easier to design a game like this then one based on strategy/skill. That is not to say the top online games these days have no strategy/skill, rather if you do not have high apm then all then all the strategy in the world won't prevent you from being roflstomped.",
            "You probably feel this way in more arenas than just mario kart, the mentality you speak of will cause you to lose in general.... go on a date and think what if this girl doesn't like me... shoot the final shot in a game and think what if this doesn't go in..... there was a study and they asked I believe it was field goal kickers their perception of them kicking the football. The ones that made it said the goal was extremely wide, but the ones that missed it complained that the goal seemed smaller than usual. Life is all about the mental you can ask yourself questions that make you anxious or you can ask yourself questions that make you strive to become something more.... What if YOU were the best online mario kart player that ever lived? We may never know",
            "I used to feel that way too. Just do it, worst thing that could happen is you might not like it, but if you do, then Good for you! I play rocket league without any voice thing and no cares. So do it, atleast once!",

            "I usually don\u2019t get nervous playing mp games unless I\u2019m playing with people including friends. When I started Dead by Deadlight, I used to get anxious playing killer but I\u2019m fine with it now even when I do terrible. \n\nNow Smite is a whole different beast. Started playing again and last time I was into it, I was never good anyways. Playing conquest is pretty scary because there\u2019s so much you gotta do in each role and when you do bad, someone\u2019s always gotta insult you even if you\u2019re new or just having a simple bad game. I started playing with a group willing to teach people how to play but I still feel anxious with them even. So pretty much for me, playing with people or with randoms is a lose-lose in this game.",
            "Perhaps you're picking the wrong games? it seems like competitive online play isn't for you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA coop-centric game might be more your speed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI reccommend checking out warframe, its free to play, its on every console and whats most important: people don't judge you if you suck, instead they try to help you out when they can.... the game has a tricky learning curve but if you want a game with a wholesome community that doesn't judge you for playing your way or sucking, this is the game for you.",

            "I used to and still kinda do, what is helping is forcing myself to play online and try to not care, started playing chess recently and at first I was so damn scared to be bad against others that all I did was play against computers, but that\u2019s not how you get better because computers play very different from humans",
            "Some games have this rating system so that you can play with others similar to your skills, I think they introduced it due to this concern. I usually enjoy online game.(unless people with smurf accounts sabotages the game)",
            "It doesn't sound silly, and, you should do whatever makes you feel the most comfortable, and happy. It's a game, the point is for it to be fun. That being said, I honestly find it incredibly hard to enjoy games that \\*don't\\* have some sort of multiplayer aspect to them. I like competing versus other human players, because it shows me how good, or maybe not good I am at the game. If I suck, that's okay, you can only get better from there. And, if I don't, cool, but there's always people better than me, so, it's still fun to try to improve.  \n\n\nIn terms of toxicity, majority of the time it's kinda funny, ngl. I really like just saying random strings of words, and watching how mindlessly angry they get. Like, to give an example, I play league of legends. I had some guy going OFF on me in chat, so I kept just typing stupid shit like \"you're a doodoo diaper baby head!!! stoopid caca fart man!\" Like, unironically, typing like that. And he telling me \\*I\\* was fuming. Like, LMAO, it's really goofy how blindingly angry people get over a video game, it's hard to not laugh at it.",
            "A lot of games have a sorting algorithm to make sure you\u2019re against similarly skilled players. Definitely don\u2019t sweat it. For every game you\u2019re outclassed, there\u2019ll be a game where you stomp. Let rip and see how it goes - maybe turn off all char functionality if people are being toxic.",
            "This is weird for me, so I\u2019m turning 30 this year. I used to play online basically everyday after school ever since I got counter strike, I played games like Halo 2, COD, Ghost Recon and was one of those toxic teenagers.\n\nNow I don\u2019t want to play online because I can\u2019t be dealing with playing with other teenagers that are me 15 years ago. It gives me anxiety too, it\u2019s so strange but yes I can relate and I\u2019m good at games and was better at them when it\u2019s all I did in my spare time, now I have a job and hobbies I hardly touch games so it gives me even more anxiety going into online games.",
            "Hey it\u2019s okay to feel like this. Most of the gaming community will not blame you for losses. It\u2019s a team effort in most games. Just got to have friends you\u2019re comfortable to play with to ease into it. And then maybe go with as few friends as possible overtime.",
            "Yup. My first multiplayer experience was at 16, when I got utterly destroyed by a 6-year-old (family friend's kid). That really set the tone of \"I'm truly awful at games\" that's stuck with me ever since. To this day, I only play with my young nieces & nephews etc...and still lose most of the time. I don't dare try to play online with randoms.  \n\nFor context, I've been gaming literally since I was a toddler (first console at 3, first PC at 5), so it's not a case of me just not being as comfortable with games. I routinely lose to kids in games I've sunk hundreds of hours into. I just suck, so I avoid multiplayer like the plague lol",
            "I hate playing with strangers online, but now I'm in my 30s I have the added irritation that most of the time they are so much younger than me. Also, back when I used to play online, the N word seemed to be everyone's go-to insult when you beat them, which I really hope has changed in the intervening 10 years.",
            "You mentioned battlefront, and I'm assuming you mean the 2017 one. If you play supremacy, unless you are literally a god there is very little you yourself can do to change the course of the battle. There are 20 people on the team plus 12 bots, so in the grand scheme of the game you are literally just another grunt in the army. And the game doesnt really encourage communication between teammates, so also no worries there. Just hop on a match and run around and do your thing. No one will even know you exist (which is awesome)\n\nOn the other hand a game like siege is literally the worst. Theres only 5 people on the team and since theres no respawns you will inevitably end up in a situation where you are the only person left on the team and it's literally all up to you to win or lose. That's why siege is literally the only game I always get shaky with anxiety in. For some reason I really love the game though so I keep playing even when shaking with anxiety lol",
            "It's a normal way to feel - it's the same reason why we don't (generally) join up with a group of strangers who want to play a sports game, even if they're looking for new players, unless we're really into the sport. There's an anxiety there. I've also avoided online games, unless they're particularly low-key, low-energy (ToS anyone?).\n\nBut I have two siblings who are under age 10, who both do online gaming. Whether that's a good idea or not, at their age, isn't my call, but it is amazing to see these two idiots burst into some online game and completely mess it up. They don't play anything with headsets, and they rarely type. Can you imagine playing Among Us with these two? You'd be so pissed off. But they have fun.\n\nSo if they can get away with it, then we should be allowed to be idiots as well. A life lesson I took to heart when I had to drive through some foreign countries alone - it's okay to look (or be) dumb sometimes, especially when it's around no one you know.\n\nAlso, just remember that if you're playing an online game and the outcome depends on an internet stranger, that person may be a 6-year-old on an iPad.",
            "The first and only time I felt true anxiety was playing Division 2 in the dark zone. Not a bad thing but that stuck with me.",

            "You\u2019re fine for feeling like that but maybe playing online in among us will help with your anxiety. Just remind yourself that it doesn\u2019t matter you might enjoy it\n\nI suck at among us btw lol",
            "I'm not sure what the draw of playing with strangers is. Almost seems like 'if we do the same activity then we are friends'",
            "Yeah I have a ton of anxiety, but im also very competitive, so when I know I can beat and finish a game, I enjoy it more than games where the climb never stops and you're always getting shit on by someone.",
            "Watch other people play. Twitch, YouTube, etc. You'll see how the pros play on Twitch in real time, and on YouTube just add \"beginner\" to your search and there will be plenty to learn there",
            "Definitely stems from a fear of losing in my opinion.\n\nI know people who would never play chess online because fears of losing. The same people would always play the computer instead, despite humans often being easier if you know what you're doing.",
            "I quit multiplayer games for about two years due to toxicity. I came back after meeting very wholesome gaming communities on Twitch that basically restored my faith in online gaming. However, I had the same anxiety as you in the years preceding my break. It was very clear the effect it had on my gameplay. While I no longer care whether I personally win or lose (even in a game like Escape From Tarkov where dying means you potentially lose stuff you\u2019ve worked hours or days for), it\u2019s definitely caused my skill to hit a ceiling in some games. I don\u2019t take risks when I need to or I make stupid decisions like rushing out in the open trying to save a teammate in fear of getting yelled at again.\n\nIt helps a lot if you can find a good group of people to play with.\n\nAt the end of the day, you can mute in pretty much every single game. With that in mind, all you have left is to just understand that in the end, it\u2019s a game with no real stakes. Games can be a lot less stressful if you view it that way. Would good comms possibly give you an advantage? Yes. Is it worth the possibility of toxicity? I don\u2019t think so.",
            "The Anomonity help a lot, but if we get 10 friends all online at the same time, we end up doing a 5v5 on Dota or CS:GO, or a 4v4 on L4D. That, I don't like.",

            "I do. Wanna play together?",
            "My suggestion is if you do play online and get anxious, do not, I repeat, do NOT communicate with anyone.\nPeople who you play sports with will not say the vile and toxic shit people say during esports. It\u2019s something to do with anonymity and being immature. If you want to play online play with friends or people you already know in real life and it\u2019ll be much friendlier.",
            "Depends on the game. I like world of Warcraft but I\u2019m not there to chat or make friends. I\u2019m there to farm for hours mobs or spend days picking flowers .",
            "Mario Kart is a great one to start with - there is no chat (beyond the ability to choose a handful of preset phrases on the loading screen - 'hello', 'good game', that stuff), and then once you're playing, the experience is exactly the same as playing AIs, except real people are slightly less predictable. Good luck! You can do it!",

            "I experienced this a lot with WoW - I was always afraid to run mythic dungeons with strangers. Other players have no tolerance for noobs and they expect you to know everything perfectly. It always seemed strange to me that I still had social anxiety, even when I was anonymous in an online world. I like to call it \"virtual agoraphobia\".",

But now i don't care anymore haha I just play chill and do my best during rank tho I still refuse playing duo specially with someone i don't know. If it was with my cousins I'm fine because they were not toxic.   \nSometimes when I know its my fault we lost I just shrugged it off lol. I mean anyone can be the reason why you lost the game and most of the time you probably just have a bad team play lol. And I always mute haha",

            "If playing a video game online causes anxiety it might be time to see a mental health professional lmao\n\nIf you have anxiety being anonymous on the internet you got issues man How does one expect to deal with real life if something so little causes undue stress?!\n\nI understand if you mean playing online can be frustrating, annoying, and not fun because of stupid kids, the skill curve being really high or toxic players, or you just cant be arsed to chat with strangers to play but thats not the same thing",
            "It depends on what you're looking in a game. I like being competitive and testing my skills in various situations, so playing online make sense for me. But if you enjoy the gameplay and the fun of the game more than anything, then it's fine to just stay offline",
            "My friend, this happens to me every single time I start a new game with an online component. I\u2019m always so apprehensive and delay the \u201cgo live\u201d as long as possible. Why?! I\u2019m not an anxious person otherwise, but there\u2019s something about the competitive perfectionist inside me that hates the idea of going online and getting destroyed. I can probably thank Smash for that",
            "I only play online games, I enjoy the competition against the anonymous strangers. I'd make a game recommendation for you, of you have Xbox especially or Pc. \n\nDestiny2. It has lots of activities where you get match made with team mates against ai enemies in strikes and patrols, you don't need microphones at all. It has a great community and if you want to dip your toes into player Vs player, it's great for that because the modes are generally good fun and I've only ever gotten 2 or 3 bad messages in 4 years of playing, and when I look at them, i just send them a thumbs up and block them. You can also report arseholes through the game reporting system and Xbox live. Xbox take zero prisoners for that stuff.",
            "Yeah I don\u2019t blame you for being anxious. Teenagers are basically devil spawn, they are extremely abusive nasty creatures. I grew up playing Xbox live and stopped playing because of racism and constant toxicity, it took a toll on my mental health.",

That guilt/shame surfaces because of time \"wasted\". The guilt/shame tries to protect you from this \"waste\" by motivating you through bad feelings. Its a social and biological mechanism that is often maladaptive, like it is here where you are shaming yourself and then that shame results in the opposite of productive behavior. If you can recognize that this guilt is well intended, then you can start to treat yourself with self compassion when you \"waste\" time rather than suffering from your own shame. Less shame means more space to breathe and grow. When you start to to feel that guilt of wasting time, you shift towards addressing your own needs that are driving the avoidant behaviors, e.g. I have eating troubles or I wakeup with nightmares or I'm just so damn stressed that I wakeup a hot mess. It is hard to achieve this without disarming the shame. In practice its more 'ike \"disarm shame, improve your habits, disarm more shame, improve more habits\" in a positive feedback loop where both are happening at the same time.!<\n\nI also like the phrasing of this post.

            "My understanding is that salt is a natural \"universal spice.\" Our tastebuds are attuned to salt. We need it.\n\nPepper is chemesthetic meaning it increases the sensitivity of the taste buds. It magnifies the taste of everything.\n\nIt is somewhat cultural when black pepper is selected.

Salt is chemically necessary to make food taste \"better\", but the salt and black pepper pairing is kinda arbitrary and due to historical reasons like other commenters have noted. Also, seasoning food before eating it is a learned cultural behavior. In some cultures, it would be considered offensive to the cook, especially if you didn't even taste it. \n\nIn China, people like to dip certain foods in black vinegar (similar to balsamic but not as sweet or dense).  In Thailand, food typically comes with [4 core condiments](http://www.thaifoodandtravel.com/blog/thai-condiment-sets/): fish sauce, sugar, dried chili flakes, and vinegar/lime juice.

That\u2019s why at a fancy restaurant they\u2019ll often ask if you want \u201cfreshly ground pepper\u201d on your whatever. \n\nSo, you could argue that salt and pepper both go at the table instead of in the kitchen because they both make sense to apply to food after it\u2019s cooked (salt as a personal adjustment, pepper for the raw flavor), while other spices should be applied during cooking.",

            "Black pepper has an interesting history. It\u2019s one of the most common spices and was traded and used as far back as Egyptian and Roman times. It\u2019s easily transported and doesn\u2019t go bad once the peppercorn is dried. In ancient times it was considered to be a luxury item by the wealthy, and was often used as collateral or currency. It is rumored that Alaric I (King of  the Visigoths) as well as Attila (Ruler of the Huns) both demanded a ransom of black pepper (over a ton worth) in order to stop attacking Rome in the 5th century. Sailors and traders would use it as an international form of currency. Pepper was a big big deal. \n\nSalt has two major sources, evaporated sea water and from mines. It\u2019s a nutrient we all need, but the ancients wouldn\u2019t know that. They would only know they craved it. Salt used to be a bit harder to come by especially if you lived inland or in a mountainous or fresh water region.  Given how it can also preserve foods, it became pretty important as well. \n\nBoth are on the table in part because of their historical importance, pepper used to be a status symbol, and salt is something we enjoy, plus to just have it laying around on your table was also a bit of a flex. Both have the ability to make meat and other foods less bland. Plus if you had meat that wasn\u2019t in a great condition (was about to or was going bad) before you cooked the shit out of it, those spices could help you with the taste, especially pepper.  \n\nWhy not other spices? Most spices are region specific, and some travel better than others. We also have what is trending in each of those regions food wise. Some spices would be more in demand in certain regions than others. Pepper though because it has been valued for so long and since its been the most traded for literally a millennia and more has become a staple. It\u2019s apart of east and western cultures, but westerns now have the tradition of paring pepper and salt together. Other spices don\u2019t often go on the table because we don\u2019t use the majority of spices to season to taste. Just salt, and just pepper.",

            "I agree with what you're saying but if you want a specific freshly ground pepper flavour it really should go on at the end. Pepper has many aromatic compounds that are very volatile and quickly evaporate when heated. This is also why pre-ground pepper isn't as flavourful because once the skin is cracked open these compounds can evaporate more easily. Not saying it shouldn't be used in cooking but there is a difference in flavour between fresh and cooked. I also happen to think that too many recipes call for salt and pepper when it's completely unnecessary. A little pinch of pepper in a big pot isn't going to make any noticible difference.",

Peppercorns were once such a rare trade good, they could be used as currency. And I want to say (could be faulty memory) that one of the King Louis' of France was known to favor it so much he seasoned all of his food with it table side.

For many kings, amassing lots of salt was also a sign of power.\n\n>However, there was one condiment with which it was even easier to show how wealthy and mighty you were: pepper. Originally popularized by the ancient Romans, who couldn\u2019t get enough of this stuff, prices reached crazy heights even back then. At one point, they offered an invading army as much as 3,000 pounds of pepper as a peace agreement.\n\n>In 1468, the Duke of Bourgogne used pepper as a decoration for his wedding: 380 pounds of it! Way to show who\u2019s boss, huh? Of course we\u2019ve gotten smarter about using pepper more resourcefully, but it remains, to this day, a little status symbol atop our kitchen tables.",

Probably history, culture, inadvertent brainwashing by every restauarant having them on the tables.\n\nWhat makes more sense to me is being able to adjust the 'salt' and 'heat' of a dish. Black pepper can contribute to heat, but it also has its own distinct flavor. I think the way to go is to have cayenne or red chili flake available instead. They both carry a higher heat:flavor ratio than black pepper. As a bonus, seasoning white or pale sauces with cayenne in lieu of black pepper doesn't interfere with the visual integrity of the dish by having splotches of darkness that look dirty and unappetizing.\n\nTL;DR: I think you should use cayenne as an all-around flavoring agent instead of black pepper.",

It's because they are the most widely used.  \n  \nSalt and pepper have flavors that you could have on their own, without any other seasoning and be perfectly happy with the results; that's not the same with other seasonings and spices.  \n  \nSalt and pepper can be used just as diversely with sweet and savory dishes, other spices don't always work that way.  Salt and pepper can be used with the rest of your spices AND on their own; they are not opposites, they compliment each other better than every other spice in your rack.  \n  \nIn short, you are thinking of them as opposites, maybe because of color or whatever but they are not opposites, they are the most complimentary, they are the most versatile and they are the most acceptable to a wider flavor palate.",

So, from a Police Officers (retired from New York State) point of view, the correct answer to the first question is ALWAYS whatever the speed limit is on that particular road. If the speed limit is 55, say you were going 55 or less. Never say you were going even 1 MPH or KPH over the limit. If you do, you\u2019re admitting guilt and it can be used against you in court. \n\nThe answer to the second question is ALWAYS \u201cNo.\u201d That is all. Even if you know you were pulled over for something extremely obvious, if you say that you know why, it is admissible. \n\nSome people will argue that if you\u2019re honest, you may catch a break. I can only speak for myself when I say that as long as you\u2019re courteous and treat me the way I treat you, that\u2019s where you got your break. I always asked people those questions because sometimes people panic. People have admitted to atrocious crimes simply because a police officer asked \u201cDo you know why I stopped you?\u201d Sometimes guilty people think everyone is on to them so when asked, they may say \u201cYes, because I killed my girlfriend but I didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d \n\nAsking those questions admittedly made my job easier when it came to court. If I could get a person to say in court that they weren\u2019t going 50 in a 30, but they say \u201cI was going maybe 32,33.\u201d, that\u2019s a win for me. All I have to do is establish that they knew or should have known the speed limit was 30 and they admitted to 32, I simply say \u201cNo further questions Your Honor.\u201d  You just convicted yourself. \n\nSo take the advice everyone gives and shut up!",

Maybe that officer's feeling particularly forgiving or maybe they've had a really crappy day and they have no more patience for grace.\n\nIt's important to note that you do not have to say anything other than \"no\" (not talking at all is a dumb idea).

You learn about the behaviors that a \"good man\" will exhibit in various settings. It's not some for sure thing though. \n\nWomen do the same thing about other women but it gets said in a different way.",
            "Yes, to some extent. \n\nParticularly I find that bad guys assume other guys are bad guys like them, and they'll quickly expose how much of an asshole they are by letting their guard down they moment the women are out of earshot.",
            "Women can do this for other women too.\n\nWhen I started dating my wife I introduced her to all my women friends.\n\nThey all gave their approval.\n\nNearly 20 years later still happy married to this wonderful woman.",
            "We men get to be around men when there are no women around, meaning we're more likely to know how he really feels about women than you. Some men reveal very... bad sides... when no women are present, and then switch to \"perfect gentlemen\" when women walk in. Since we get to see both sides, it's easier to determine who a man truly is at his core.\n\nOf course not infallible though, I've met dudes who other guys have told me were \"great guys\" who then said very sexist weird things about women around me. So I guess where it falls flat is that different men have different thresholds for \"great guy\", since I wouldn't say guys who say sexist things are great guys at all.",
            "They are probably watching how he treats you, if they feel he is caring and respectful of you. If he is dismisive or condescending or inattentive to you, then we'd assume he's a jerk. \n\nWe're not infallible, of course. But if the guy seems to genuinely care about you, it's a good sign.",
            "Yep we definitely do. \n\nWe also sense bad men, I'm always suprised when a girl once again dates an asshole who ends up cheating, and then she seems completely suprised, I guess it's just a men thing. \n\n\nNo idea how it works",
            "Well, men put up a facade in front of women a lot of the times.  that change tells us a lot about how they actually are. women don't see it because of the facade.",
            "I guess men may be more familiar with male behavior and know how to read into it in a way women might not? That's just a hypothesis, because I've always felt it's immediately obvious when my sister's gotten a shitty boyfriend and ends up surprised when he turns out to be shitty. It was immediately obvious to me the first time I met him that his actions weren't sincere.\n\nThen, when she got a solid one she seemed to want my opinion on him because she had such a bad track record with men. She was no more or less sure about that guy than any of the others, but to me it was night and day after just meeting him a couple of times. Guy seemed genuinely kind and sincere and I was more afraid my sister was going to fuck up the relationship than the other way around.\n\nYou can always tell when a guy is of a \"Ugh, I'm going to be nice because that's what the girlfriend wants\" type and when it's a \"I'm acting the way I am because I genuinely love and respect my girlfriend\"",
            "Lot of good answers below about acting nice around women then an ass when they are out of earshop.

            "For the most part, although I've also met some totally oblivious dudes as well. For me, there are dozens of little things that tell me if another guy is \"good\" or not. Some examples when I meet someone new are how hard is this guy trying to impress me? Does he joke around with the group or try to correct everyone and act superior? Does he put down others? Does he ask questions and get to know people or just steamroll into a group? Those are just a few off the top of my head.",
            "Quite a few of us know exactly what to look for in other men that says important things about them,  yeah. \n\nWe're not typically looking at eachother through the haze of lust or psychologically distorted cultural ideas of romanticism - we look at another guy most often with either indifference or as a potential threat in some fashion.\n\nAnd we read them accordingly.\n\nIf you have a straight male friend you can trust and that's of a reasonably smart,  observant nature, he'll be the one you should ask to size up other dudes. \n\nIf he says some shit about these dudes that seems wild or that you just aren't seeing yourself,  consider the possibility that he might well be seeing some shit that you should at least think about as likely being valid even if it's in your blind spots.\n\nBecause we can be really fuckin good at figuring out of some other dude is a piece of shit and what to expect from their style of shittitude, or if they're probably alright except for this and maybe that,  and so on. \n\nWe do it all the damn time.",
            "The average asshole is also usually either dumb or a narcissist. In either case it never occurs to them that other men will not agree with them when they start shit talking women. Note that this also applies to any group that views another group as lesser. As a white man in the southern US the number of other white people, men and women, who just casually drop the n word and expect me to go along with it is staggering. \n\nOf course the truly terrible men are those who are intelligent or sly enough to understand that they need to feel out other men before being their true horrible selves. It can be just as hard for us to tell as it is for women. Fortunately they are few and far between, although they usually end up doing the most damage.",
            "Men are the most dangerous threat to men. So we do have sort of a subconscious assessment based on body language and attitude. But beyond that assholes will often act different when women aren't around. They'll drop comments and hints to sound you out, or just flat out say or do bad things. Or they'll start trying to assert themselves as dominant when there's no cause.",
            "It's kind of like how \"dogs can tell if someone is good\".  They can't.  They are just good at noticing common types of body language.\n\nDudes are kind of the same.  We aren't recognizing good guys.  We are just reading some of the queues.",
            "It's not really sorcery, and it's never going to be perfect, but most men tend to understand men and what they're about.\n\nWe have to, because we have to deal with them. If a guy is a snake or an asshole, we need to know so we don't get fucked over by them. If a guy is a 'good dude', he's doing to treat his fellow men well. By extension, he is going to treat you well. Men are very character based. If a man is loyal/trustworthy, he is loyal/trustworthy. If a men is just out for himself or hyper-competitive or always trying to be on top we need to know.\n\nWe are always 'sizing' each other up so we know how to deal with each other. I can generally tell a few traits from the first time I meet a guy. Shake their hand, look in their eyes. See how they treat people around them. See if they come in trying to establish themselves as the top dog or boastful. See if they can't look in the eyes properly. They might be 'nice' but probably not good.\n\nNow I should say, just because a man is a  'good' man doesn't mean is he the right man for you. That's more up to you. Do you value a 'good man'. Maybe you want the hyper-competitive man. Maybe you want the top dog. Maybe you want someone you push over. Maybe you want more of an exciting man.",

            "Game recognizes game, no joke. \nHarsh, silly term but it sends the message across.\n\nWhen I was younger I treated women in a way where I could have done much better. I've also seen/heard friends/collegeas do stuff that's insincere or manipulative.\nI can recognize when a guy has bad or good intentions with a woman, what type of talk is just to get in her pants and what is sincere. Also I can sense/see when something is off with a guy.\n\nPart intuition, part experience. \n\nWomen have the same with other women. \n\nIf you don't have direct or indirect experience it's wayyyy harder.",
            "Sometimes yes. I think there is another side of guys you see when it's just the guys that if they're an asshole is pretty telling. That being said it's not perfect by any means. I have been surprised by friends who were jerks to women that I wouldn't have suspected. That is something that happened more when I was younger though so perhaps my sense about it has gotten better?

He was talking about how hot the wait staff was, how he cheated on Julia, how she was clueless, etc.\n\nWell - it's kinda like that, but much less direct. You just see how they react to other women. How they react when they think it's \"just us guys\". Because guys - and especially dumb guys - can't imagine that other guys aren't exactly like they are.

            "Probably Middle English, so somewhere between 1150 and 1500. \"Fucking asshole\" in Middle English would have been something like \"Fukkinge arshole\" or \"Fukkende arshole\", which is pretty similar. \n\nOld English was pretty different, and the word \"fuck\" probably wasn't in English at that point, since it's thought to have come from Norse at a later period. I don't know if Old English used the word \"asshole\", but they did have \"ass\" in the form of \"\u00e6rs\" and \"hole\" in the form of \"hol\". Those are still pretty similar, so they may have understood \"asshole\", but not \"fucking\".",
            "Between 300 and 600 years ago things started to sound understandable to us. This from Wiki: \n\nThe **Great Vowel Shift** was a series of changes in the [pronunciation of the English language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_phonology) that took place primarily between 1400 and 1700, beginning in southern England and today having influenced effectively all dialects of English. Through this [vowel shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel_shift), the pronunciation of all Middle English [long vowels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel_length) was changed. Some consonant sounds changed as well, particularly those that became silent; the term *Great Vowel Shift* is sometimes used to include these consonant changes.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Vowel_Shift#cite_note-1)[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Vowel_Shift#cite_note-2)\n\nEnglish spelling started being standardised in the 15th and 16th centuries, and the Great Vowel Shift is the major reason English spellings now often deviate considerably from how they [represent pronunciations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonemic_orthography).[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Vowel_Shift#cite_note-3) The Great Vowel Shift was first studied by [Otto Jespersen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Jespersen) (1860\u20131943), a [Danish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark) [linguist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics) and [Anglicist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_studies), who coined the term.[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Vowel_Shift#cite_note-4)",

So you can tell Shakespeare he's a fucking asshole and he'd probably get it if he can understand your accent, but you wouldn't have much luck with Chaucer.
