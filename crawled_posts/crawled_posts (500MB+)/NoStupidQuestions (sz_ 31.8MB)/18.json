A lot of the foods I love(d) weren't easily available in Australia or I didn't know enough about ingredients to know it was available if I just made it myself. Anyways I all the time wanted some good old fashioned fatty American deep fried goodness and this was the time in my life when I watched a lot of man v food and bizarre foods, I have an adventurous palate so some of the bizarre foods even got my mouth watering. Quite a few actually. But I would always plan man v food night around whatever American concoction I was feeling that week. I'd always do one good American style dinner a week, or try to, and watch man v food while I ate my meal I looked forward to for the last 6 days. It was the only way I could watch it and not end up mad as hell because I'm starving and nothing is even close to that good lol",

            "Cursive is a product of a time when you could be spending many hours each day just writing. Before everyone had a computer, it was common that you had to draw up neat documents or term papers by hand writing. It's easier to do this in cursive because you don't have to lift the pen from the paper as often, which is easier on your hands.\n\nAlso, in pre-Victorian times (think Jane Austen) paper was expensive. People would often fit multiple sheets' worth of information onto one sheet by crossing their lines -- writing like normal on one page, portrait oriented, then turning the paper 90 degrees and writing again landscape on top of the portrait-oriented text. The result looked like a grid. But the thing is, because of the way our brains work, this is actually legible in cursive because our brains naturally filter out the vertical text and decipher the words until we turn the paper. This works with cursive, but doesn't work with print.\n\nCursive is not a necessity in the modern world, but the curriculum just hasn't been updated.\n\nEdit: Nah, y'all are right, it's not that cursive is no longer relevant - it's true there are still applications for it. Just, MOST people don't strictly need it day to day any longer and have the option of opting out of using it. I think it's important to learn it as a child even if you don't use it later, because it at least teaches you to read cursive. And if you want to pick it up again as an adult it's easier if you already have the muscle memory. \n\nTBH I actually write in cursive and I find it useful, but I do find that more and more people can't read my handwriting. Which is sad because I struggle to write in print and my disability makes it harder to print than to write cursive.\n\nOh and for those who were interested, you can Google \"crossed lines letter\" to see examples.\n\nHere's what it looks like.\n\nhttp://www.earsathome.com/webgil/xltr2.jpg",
            "You were also taught it because it is a great fine motor control and hand eye coordination practice that they can have you do in the classroom, while seated, and be learning spelling, writing, etc. while you do it.

            "I know they have phased out cursive writing in US schools but I am definitely NOT happy about it, for different reasons than the ones most here have said tho. Teaching cursive writing has added benefits besides just nice handwriting. It causes the student to concentrate a little more on what they are writing/taking notes on, thus helping it stay in memory better. It also teaches hand/eye coordination, a skill that is falling due to also cutting funding on arts in schools.  Basically if it doesn't lead to a \"job skill\" or make money for someone else, a lot of schools have stopped teaching it. Sad.",

            "Cursive is not necessarily taught in Irish schools. I never learned it when I was in school (70's and 80's), and my two older kids didn't learn it either.

At least for this one year. \n\nIn secondary school she can write how she likes so long as it's legible, but she has developed fine motor control doing cursive that she didn't have, and has, hands down, the best handwriting of anyone in the house.\n\nHandwriting is still an important life skill. I work an office job in front of a computer but I still have to add hand written notes to things often, and yake notes in meetings and on training courses, and it's a huge pain when you can't read what someone else (or yourself) has written.",
            "I was also made to write in cursive back in elementary school. I still can, but I really only use it when signing my name, which mostly is done when signing touchscreens at hospitals or when doing my taxes, occasionally on other documents. My cursive is super ugly, and so is my print. Ugly print is significantly easier to read then ugly cursive so I always use print when writing, which is definitely still a thing if you are in school, not just for notes (which I know many just type on computers) but the majority of my assignments and tests in college (last semester I attended was winter 2019, so recently) required me to use pencil on paper. And actually write words, like on tests in Spanish class or quizzes in english where we were asked to write answers about characters or events in required reading. Math tests were all handwritten. Chemistry, as well. All regular/minor assignments were handwritten. I think the only assignments that weren't pencil on paper were essays and other long writing assignments, and that goes for every class. Essays were typed and submitted online. This comment is just a personal experience to respond to the many comments I've seen about \"people don't even need to write anyway. Can't remember when I last held pencil/pen\". I think I end up writing something with pens or pencils almost daily. I'll probably teach my kids cursive outside of school just to let them choose how they want to write, and for signing documents. It's just an aesthetic thing. Cursive signatures look cooler.",

My husband and I both use it to write notes to each other. We also use it to write in things like birthday cards. Pretty much any time I am writing something by hand, I prefer to write in cursive. I find it faster and more natural than printing, which, as the name implies, is really only an efficient writing system for machines.",

It became a joke that it looked like I was writing in Arabic... but it was just cursive.

Everything they told us in school was true at the time: that we wouldn't have a calculator on us, that we would need legible handwriting, and so on. People usually can't conceive of this type of shift before it happens.",

He was a couple years older than me and educated in the US.

My high school let everyone borrow laptops yet I had teachers who only let us use them for two assignments a year because they didn\u2019t know how to use them.

            "Sorry about your brother. That has to be incredibly hard.\n\n>just a little help on how to take care of and bond\n\nIf she's a lab then the fact that you exist creates a bond. They're generally *extremely* friendly dogs, so you don't have to actually do a whole lot other than feed her and she'll think you're awesome. Playing would be high on her list of things to do as well. Fetch will probably be her favorite activity since labs, and their cousins golden retrievers, absolutely *love* to bring things back to their person. She'll easily do that for as long as you want to throw a ball for her. Walks would be good too, though she'll probably want to stop and sniff everything that a squirrel or neighborhood cat has ever come near.\n\n>Doggo is frightened and scared when I saw her. Finally got her to eat when I got on the floor, rolled over to show my belly.\n\nThe fact that you got her to calm down and eat is a great start. Good job!\n\nMake sure you get her some toys if she doesn't already have any. Labs are smart and if they don't have something to do they'll get bored and can be destructive and start chewing on things. A nice dog bed would be a good idea as well, unless you don't mind her laying on your furniture or sleeping in bed with you. Even then, she might want her own place that's just for her.",

            "Im so sorry for your loss. I cannot imagine your pain. As for your brothers dog, I want you to know that the dog is not only dealing with the fear of being in a new environment with a new person, but is also grieving too. Dogs feel deeply and have been known to mourn the loss of their owners and siblings. I hope you give yourself grace when taking care of his dog as long as you open your heart to it. If you don\u2019t think you can bring yourself to do that, I do implore you to find his dog a loving home. I would think, like most pet-owners, that your brother would want his dog to be thoroughly loved above all else",
            "Losing a sibling is shit - I've been there. About a year later I got (what I @ call) a grief cat. I don't like cats much, but I happened upon a kitten and my sibling loved cats. The poor cat now comes and cuddles only when I'm sad, otherwise seems to dislike being touched. Either way, the dog is sad without your brother and you can cuddle together. They are better to be sad with (my dogs always have seems to feel sad with me, cuddle, and the weight is like a weighted blanket). However, if you do honestly dislike dogs and don't want to or can't take care of it, keep an ear out for friends and family who want a dog ... A place maybe you could visit if you want or see the dog be happy. Dogs are a big commitment (despite cats living longer, dogs you have to walk and entertain a bit more) - and I know having something of your brothers like this is precious, but you also have to figure out this new life.",

            "1. Make sure you have the supplies needed\n   1. Food (I'd contact the dog's vet to find out what is good for them)\n   2. Food bowl and Water bowl (You'll also want a container to store the food in)\n   3. Leash and Harness (you don't want just a leash)\n   4. Poop Bags (bread bags work but special bags are nice)\n   5. Dog bed (Dogs like furniture but they also like having a set place to sleep)\n   6. Vet Information (This is important so make sure you know the vet and have their contact info. They'd also be a good resource for help)\n   7. Collar (With tags to indicate vaccinations and your contact info)\n   8. Dog Toys (A soft ball for inside, a toy for tug-of-war, a sturdy toy for chewing, and a tennis ball for outside are good options to cover the main bases)\n   9. Heart Guard and Flea and Tick meds (depends on your area but these are important if the dog goes in a yard often)\n   10. Treats (if she is food motivated then treats will be useful for training, however basic it may be)\n   11. A cage or plan for keeping her out of trouble (I'll explain this more later)\n2. Assuming you just got her I'd take her on a tour of the property. Show her the yard (if you have one) and the rooms. Also make sure to set your rules now. If you are ok with her being on furniture that makes things easier but if not make sure she learns now that she can't be on things. If you don't have a yard then now is a good time to walk her and show her where you will be taking her when she needs to go potty. Also, if you have any other pets introduce them slowly. Usually keep them in separate rooms for a couple days. Find something that smells like each animal and let the other animal smell that thing. After that if they are calm introduce them in a place where both animals have an exit if needed. If things go poorly then I'd suggest getting an expert to help out but labs are usually friendly with other things. \n3. As far as bonding goes, it shouldn't be too hard. Just spending time with her (walking, feeding, petting, playing, etc.) will help her bond with you. Labs are almost always very friendly dogs so she should warm up to you fairly quickly. \n4. Day-to-day things you should focus on: walking, feeding, playing, leaving the house, and sleeping\n   1. Walking: I would strongly recommend walking her at least once a day, twice if possible. If you are going to be out of the house for long periods during the day (school or a job) then make sure to walk her before you leave. A good walk is usually about 10-15 minutes (like around the block) and gives her time to sniff, stretch her legs, and go to the bathroom. I would also recommend walking her before you go to bed. If you walk her at night it could be a short walk (5-10 minutes). Remember, walking her is probably one of the most important things you can do. It will give her exercise and give you exercise. Consistently walking her will make her healthier, happier, and easier to deal with.\n   2. Feeding: I would talk to her vet about what food to get her and how much to give her. I've always fed my dogs twice a day (7 am and about 6:30 pm) but you could also do 3 times or different times. The important thing here is to make sure she eats the same amount of food each time and at the same times each day. Keeping her diet constant will make her feel better and she'll get into a routine of reminding you when it is her dinner time (she will remember). I would also recommend letting her outside (or quick walking) after each meal. This way she can use the bathroom. \n   3. Playing: This is pretty simple really. Dogs usually like belly rubs, back rubs, and head scratches but every dog is different. Just try things until she tells you what she likes. As far as toys go, follow her lead. She will indicate what she wants you to do. Also, if you are putting in high energy, she will reciprocate and have fun. \n   4. Leaving the house: I would recommend getting a dog crate for her. I would put some blankets or a bed in the crate for comfort. Then, when you leave, give her a treat once she is in the crate. At first she might not love going in the crate but after a little while she'll recognize that when she goes in the crate she gets a treat which will excite her. If she doesn't care about treats then you could try giving her a special toy just for the crate. If that doesn't work I'd talk to a dog trainer. It's important to remember the crate is not a punishment, but is a safe space for her. It is somewhere she can go when she needs alone time and to protect her from getting into things when you leave. \n\nI'm really sorry for your loss. I have a younger sister and would be devastated to lose her. As far as the dog goes, I would be happy to give you my snapchat or instagram (dm me if you want) in case you have any questions. I'm not a dog professional but I have lived with dogs my entire life and know how to care for them.",
            "I'm so sorry for your loss. \n\nI own a lab right now and I hope some of this helps. \n\nFood is the way to a labs heart. If she eats fast or drinks fast, you might want to look into a puzzle bowl. They help slow them down when eating. \n\nThey are a great combination of energetic during walk and play time, and lazy oafs at night. If she pulls on the leash, keep some treats in your pocket and reward her when she walks next to you to curb the behavior. \n\n We have a tug rope and tough frisbee for our dog, anything else she will chew up. We got her specific rubber balls to play with because she will skin tennis balls and chew up plush toys. Kong toys are a good brand. \n\nOther odd dog stuff:\nObviously labs love playing fetch, but can be a bit slobbery so straight up get a drool rag for fetch. \n\nLabs are big dogs so be ready for her to potentially bolt for a squirrel while on the leash, or if she sees other dogs. Same for going to the vet, be ready to have control in unfamiliar territories. \n\nYou've got a free garbage disposal for any (safe) food scraps when cooking. Our lab loves carrots. \n\nPeanut butter is the easiest best treat. \n\nGood luck friend.",

            "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. Then compounding your grieving with this new responsibility... that\u2019s a lot. So take time for you. Just you. The dog will eventually come around. Promise. I\u2019ve had dozens of rescues and they all come around in due time. She is grieving too. She lost her human. Her world revolves around your brother and they definitely grieve and mourn the loss of a \u201cpack mate\u201d- any animal or human they share a home with is their pack. \nI\u2019ve rehomed dozens of challenging dogs. \nSo just offer love. Treats. Try to sit on the floor instead of couches or the bed. So you\u2019re eye level with her. Get a dog bed for her(if she doesn\u2019t have one) and one for you. Keep them  in the same room but with a decent distance. I suggest hers in a corner and yours about 10-15 ft away, both along the same wall if possible. \nSome furniture rearranging might be necessary for a few weeks. Seriously 2- 3 weeks, of that, usually it works with a weekish. \n\nSo leave a treat on her bed. And walk away. Do this a few times throughout the day. I recommend after walks or when going to bed. Do this 2 days. Then start sitting on your bed (or blanket pile, pillows.... whatever- it\u2019s your bed. \nSo go put a treat on her bed. Make a sound every time you put a treat on her bed. Look up Pavlovs belli (explains conditioning). Then. Take a snack for yourself to your bed to sit and eat on your bed. Just do this every so often/ few times a day at least. \n\nThe goal is that when you make the noise (I do a kiss kiss noise) she knows it\u2019s treat time. \nSo you\u2019re giving her treats multiple times a day, your chilling on your bed with your treat, moving it just a few inches closer to her bed every time you give her a treat. \n\nIf she starts to act skittish about coming over because you\u2019re too close just keep your bed in place for the next few treats. \n\nThen slowly start moving it again until you\u2019re a few feet away. Have the treat on the bed. After she goes for it, have another in your hand (and have a bunch in pockets too\u201d. While she\u2019s there watching you, lean over and place it on the bed- but stay sitting on your bed. \n\nThen try to see if she\u2019ll take the next one from your hand. If not just keep your bed there, put the treat on her bed and walk away. Try again later. Even the most stubborn/skittish dogs Ive worked with have come around within 10 days or so. Most turn around by day 3-5. \n\nIt\u2019s the consistency. Every day. Every time. Routine. Literally eating out of your hand is the goal. \n\nThey sense our emotions. So she senses your grief. She\u2019s grieving herself. She knows your brother is gone. She\u2019s hurting too. So be patient. With her and yourself. Grief takes time and is a process. Just like bonding with her will be a process. Feel free to pm me if I can be of any help. I\u2019m no therapist but I have a BS in Psychology and a BA in sociology and have trained/retrained dozens of dogs. \n\nI sincerely hope you and her can help and heal together.",

You have to be her advocate, because she can't be her own. \n\nNumber two: remember that she's grieving too. This was her human, and she bonded deeply with him. Expect weird behaviour, but don't let her training slip. She needs consistency now, more than ever. Have a clear set of rules for her to follow. If possible, keep the same rules your brother had for her - let her know that nothing's changed there, if nothing else. \n\nNumber Three: Labs, from what I've heard, are super active dogs. They need lots of playtime/walks/engagement. If they don't get that, they will get destructive. If she starts ripping things up or making mess, try tiring her out more.\n\nNumber Four: *Give it time*. I used to hate dogs. Especially this breed (bull terrier), because I thought they were ugly. Especially *this* dog, because he eats everything.   \nAdopted him from a relative, because the other option was him being put down. I didn't like dogs, but I didn't want him to *die* if I could stop it. Now I love him like my own child, annoying whining and all. I wouldn't give him up for the world.

She'll do poppies once or twice as well on those outings. If you come across any issues with accidents, post the specifics on the /dogtraining sub because approach may vary based on the reasons.\n\nWhat is \"high maintenance\" now becomes a joy when you love your dog. I love to walk my dog, I love to feed her, I love to do things for her. Maybe it's like forming new habits, it's less laborsome with time.",
            "I\u2019ve had my brothers dog since he passed away 5 years ago.  He is the only living thing that I have that is my brother.  When he passes it will be hell all over again for me and will be the last living part of my brother left but I wouldn\u2019t trade that for the world.  The way he looks at me, it\u2019s almost like looking into my brothers eyes.",
            "Talk to the dog. I mean full conversations. Sounds weird but believe me, it'll help both of you connect. Whether you share a commentary about your day or how much you miss your brother, the dog will KNOW you're engaged with them. Lots of physical contact too... even if it's just a scritch on head as you pass by. That'll help them learn you're a good guy and they're at home with you. We all know you're a good guy. After a week, they'll know too.",
            "So sorry for your loss. I read through the comments, but wanted to add my $0.02. You're both going to get through this together. I grew up with a lab, and own a Golden, but I think that retrievers as a class of dog all are very emotionally in-tune. They have the same feelings people do and I think the more time you spend together the more the pup may grow on you. Retrievers are usually intelligent, but also total goofballs. So they may be a total derp, but also very capable and great companions. One book I recommend anyone, dog person or not, to read is *Decoding Your Dog* written by members of the  American College of Veterinary Behaviorists will help you better understand her and why dogs do what they do. I know you are probably in no mood to read, but keep it in mind.\n\nAs for the \"right now\" stuff you can do: don't pressure the dog. Be present and follow the dog's lead. Just like a person grieving, sometimes you don't want to talk or hug, you just want to sit there and process without dealing with anyone -- and sometimes you just want someone present. Once she feels safe or that you're good, she'll direct you to what she needs. If she sits by you, try petting her. If she goes and lays away from you, let her lay. Just be there. You're there for each other. Just like what you're going through, you may not have the words, but you want someone there to just be there, but it helps if you reach out and say what you need through this process.\n\nIt's ok to be totally lost right now. It's ok to have no idea what to do.\n\nLike another commenter said, if you have vet records or any paperwork, keep that. If you get really stuck with the dog (she won't eat, she is having anxiety problems, or any other thing), call the vet. If the dog saw the same vet regularly, it's kinda like a Family Doctor for a human; and the vet can always advise over the phone given the current situation.\n\nOf course, remember the amount of love the pup was given by your brother and realize most dog owners want their dogs to be loved and happy, so even though everything sucks at the moment, it's a good thing you are asking for help now and trying to do the right thing.",
            "\\- Create a cozy bed for her to sleep in.\n\n\\- Walk her at least twice a day, one long walk; and a couple of short walks for pee and poo.\n\n\\- You dont need to wash a dog often, once a month. unless she rolls in fox poo or something.\n\n\\- Find other dog owners around your area where she can make a friend or two to play with.\n\n\\- Feed her twice a day, once in the morning and evening.\n\n\\- Register her with your local veterinarian clinic, and take her for annual checkups to make sure she is healthy.\n\n\\- Learn some basic training, commands like sit and come are key for you to teach her.",
            "Ya got it all wrong. Dogs are ludicrously low maintenance. They see to their own needs for the most part.\n\nAs long as it's house broken, and you've got a back yard, should be smooth sailing.\n\nDogs are as varied as humans. One of my three dogs loves splashing in the rain. Since he likes water, i just spray him down when he comes in if he's muddy. He usually isn't. 95% of the time, a rug in front of the door is sufficient.\n\nAnother dog absolutely HATES water. Tippy toes when it is a little wet outside.  It's adorable in a pathetic way. He hates being dirty.\n\nMy third dog is a husky. Water? No Shih Tzus given. Gets wet. Shakes outside before coming in. Then he is dry, and comes in. Water doesn't stick to husky fur.\n\nI've owned and interacted regularly with other dogs. NONE of them have rolled in mud. I've given probably 3 dog baths in my life. That was for fleas, before I discovered Soresto collars.\n\nDogs DO eat stupid crap. As long as it's organic material, they're probably fine.\n\nNever had any serious problem. Cats eat weird crap too. And then you get to clean their hairballs...\n\nBasically: When doggos are scared, they need you to slowly and gently interact with them, until they get used to you. She's had a lot of change. Change is scary. You are even more change. You are good and soft and nice and easy and safe change. You are new food person. New snuggle person. New help person. Make sure she knows that. But do it gently.\n\nThey need loving just like anything else.\n\nI'm fluent in both cat and dog. Pm me if you need an interpreter.",

            "I'm so sorry for your loss.  For doggy, just love her, be nice to her. Animals are smart, they will pick up on your patterns and what not. For example, my dog knows when my dad eats, he will definitely get food. Try to find the dog patterns to like what does she do right before or after she eats, needs to use the restroom, sleeps. Play with her when shes in the mood, leave her alone when she growls. That was nice of you to get down to her level to help her eat. Take it slow in time she may steal your heart.  Oh if she does anything like pee on the floor or chew your items 1) try not to yell, treat her like a kid that doesn't know any better. 2) give her replacement ways to do the thing ie: take her outside or give her toys to chew on. Good luck!",
            "You might want to contact a local rescue organization.  The people who volunteer in rescues are very passionate about dogs, and specialized rescues will have people who are very knowledgeable.

            "Okay, one step at a time:\n\n- dogs don\u2019t puke unless they eat stuff they aren\u2019t supposed to (or are ill). In my experience they puke less than cats do (I love both). Do you know which kind of food she used to eat? I\u2019d start from there. \n\n- they must not be bathed more than once a month, more is bad for them! You can get wipes to clean her up in the meantime, or even to reduce the number of baths needed. Which you don\u2019t need to do yourself, you can let groomers do it! \n\n- A good dog trainer could help you two bond. Call around and look for one that seems up for the task.\n\n- Does she have a regular vet? If yes, I\u2019d set up an appointment to talk about the situation and check the general condition of the dog, just to know where you stand (but mostly to get to know the vet and let them know you, believe me, it\u2019s important) and ask advice on how to care for your first dog. The vet was very helpful when I adopted my first dogs. \nIf she doesn\u2019t have a regular vet, then finding one and setting up a first visit (for the same reason as above) is the first thing you have to do. \n\n- I\u2019m 100% sure it\u2019s going to be fine, but if it doesn't, remember you *can* rehome her. You\u2019d just have to do your homework on the family she\u2019d go to (and can ask volunteers for help). \n\n- r/pets and r/dogs are your friends\n\nIt\u2019s going to be fine my man. I promise.",

Being torn away from the scent of a best* friend suddenly can be really hard on them.\n\nDogs are not like cats in that you kinda need to decide how much you care about them encroaching on your territory, you set limits, and train them to comply a bit more. \n\nWhat I'm getting at is decide if you want a life of them on your couch and bed.\n\nI'm the type of owner who will play with a pupper but they do not get on beds or couches (if you enforce this just know that when you aren't home they'll get up), I believe in crate training (once done training them you keep it as a safe space for them, check if she had one).\n\nDo an obedience class with her if you can safely do so that will teach you how to be an owner, and pick up a book at the library on dogs, or buy one. Get at least one big soft dog bed!\n\nShe will likely enjoy walks.

Although I do like dogs, I didn't _want_ one and had never kept one myself as an adult. She didn't leave an instruction manual, so learning about her was hard. \n\nThe cold basics: Get pet insurance or transfer the current pet insurance into your name. Make sure dog is microchipped and transfer that to your name. The vet can help you with this. \nFeed the dog twice a day. Make sure it always has water. Walk the dog once or twice a day depending on it's age and breed. Or hire someone else to do that. If you work, you might want to put the dog in daycare. \n\nEmotional shit: I became attached to mum's dog extremely quickly. Quicker than I did with mum's cat. She ended up being my shadow, as I worked at home. She died in May this year and we were absolutely broken. Remember that your brother's dog is grieving too, and you can help each other.

It is completely your choice, but know that if you cannot keep the dog she will 100% find a loving home--labs and lab mixes are considered VIP breeds, they're always in high demand, and there are 4 or 5 lab-specific rescues in my city alone. These are primarily foster-based rescues so she wouldn't be in a shelter. \n\nEven if you aren't ready to give her up, I'd start reaching out to lab rescues in your area about the situation to see if they can provide any advice for you on how to proceed. It's better to be in touch with the rescue now, than to wait until you are tired of the dog and want to rehome her. That way they'll be familiar with you and your pup and hopefully can find placement for her very quickly. Rescue people love animals and can help you. \n\nIf you do eventually choose to rehome the dog, please don't feel ashamed! You were obviously not expecting this dog to come into your life, you are dealing with a lot right now, and it's a really hard situation to handle. Whether she stays with you or goes to another loving home, you'll have done your best to provide for her and keep her safe. Best of luck to you and the pup!\n\nETA: not sure if I was clear, I just woke up, but I meant to say you can contact a rescue even if you will be keeping her! They've probably seen hundreds of labs, can offer advice on training, any behavioral issues, refer you to a good vet, and anything else a first time dog owner would need. People reach out to our shelter every day just to get medical or behavioral advice, or ask general questions about pets. I assure you, they'll be happy to help you. :)",

I called the vet and asked for suggestions until this idiot decided to take him in: months later. Didn\u2019t want it in the room with him all the time. Never potty trained him. Just dumped him off on me all day. So I trained him. Taught him how to communicate basic needs like \u201ctake me out\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m starving\u201d or \u201cmy water dish human!\u201d He would mostly sit in my lap while I played games. He also learned to sit/rollover/stay. Stay was still a big challenge for him. He was an anxiety ball and had abandonment issues. Nonstop barking when he was left alone. We\u2019d find him in the kitchen sink some days when we\u2019d get home.\n\nIt was a long hard road but that dog was like a little brother to me in the end. I did everything for him- and while I resented the fact his owner didn\u2019t do shit for him- I did my best.  With you seeking help here you are already on the right path. Listen to the dog the way you would a cat and stumble through this together.

She could also be very different personality wise. While most dogs are seen as energetic and stuff, that doesn't mean all are. My step mom had this doberman which we all loved and she was the sweetest dog you'd ever meet. She never barked or anything. She'd come over and just want your company and loved getting pet.

If you let her in your bed to sleep though I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll never want to not sleep with you, at least that\u2019s how my dog is. \n\nMake sure to take her on walks, play with her, and if you don\u2019t necessarily have the energy to play when she\u2019s feeling particularly playful, dog parks are always a good option (when you feel comfortable handling her). \n\nDogs like routine. If you can build a routine with her, she won\u2019t be much work at all. She\u2019ll wake up when you get up, use the bathroom when you take her, and eat when you want to feed her. I\u2019m a fan of free feeding, as in I put the food for the day for her as soon as we wake up in the morning. This works for us, though I\u2019m not sure what your dog is used to. Either way, routine is key.\n\nJust try to be understanding. You are both trying to transition here, and this is going to be really difficult for the both of you. Dogs are smart, sometimes too smart for their own good, and I\u2019m sure you both can work through this together. Just be there for her, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be there for you too.\n\nIf you have any other specific questions, you can always consult the vet. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be happy to help you and your inherited pup. \n\nGood luck to you, I hope this works out for the both of you.",

To paraphrase a saying I've heard before, she was a small part of your brother's life, but he was all of hers. She will miss him just as you do. If your brother didn't pass at home or if she never had contact with him after passing, she may not understand that he's passed, only that he hasn't come back to her. As others have said, love her, pet her, take care of her. Get her some toys... If you can, get ones from your brothers house for her. If you can get to his clothes, get an item or two that was recently worn but not yet washed. Not something excessively dirty or sweaty, just enough that it has his scent on it. Not something worth any \"value\" (sentimental or intrinsic)... an undershirt or something lg be perfect. If you know what her sleeping arrangements were at your brother's, mimic them. If she had a bed, or a crate, see if you can get your hands on it. If not, see if you can get the same kind. If she slept in his bed, let her do the same with you if you're OK with it. Wherever you set up for her to sleep/have a \"safe space\", put the clothing item in it. It'll help calm her.",
            "Number one thing: dogs don\u2019t understand certain things like you\u2019re busy or tired. When you come home from a long day of work, the dog has missed you all day and is excited to see you. Most people brush off the dog to get undressed, wind down, etc. \n\nDon\u2019t do this. At least not immediately. Show the dog attention and that you\u2019re just as excited to see it as it is to see you. It only takes two minutes.",
            "Damn, sorry to hear that, I hope you take care of yourself and reach out to other people as if appropriate for your situation. \n\nRegarding your doggo friend, there are a bunch of things you could do, but the most important in my mind is to learn a bit about dogs from the perspective of a cat person. I find the big difference between cats and dogs to be complexity. Cats are complex because of how differently they see the world to us. They can only see about 10m (30ft) away before their eyes lose focus. They have better vision in low light than bright daylight. They don't see what we are looking at my our eyes, rather our heads. Cats are not pack animals, preferring to congregate at times and be alone at others. \n\nDogs are complex because of how similar to us they are. Dogs have a similar range of vision to humans though their colour range is more limited, so bright sun us great, dim light less so. Dogs can track where we are looking by the direction of not just our heads, but our eyes as well. Dogs are also pack animals and so get a lot of value out of social interaction. \n\nSo dogs won't stare at birds for an hour and make clicking noises while you look at them, nor will they hunt a bird toy or catnip mouse. But a dog will play *with* you. Their play is social and includes you directly. They want you to throw the ball,l. They want you to pull the rope. They want you to wrassle with them.\n\nDogs also need different stimulation to cats. Cats need self play toys, outside environments to observe, and petting or brushing. Dogs need challenging mental stimulation and social validation. Both need exercise.  \n\nSo to build a relationship I would recommend training. The structure is a fantastic way of providing cues for both you and the dog to engage in focusing on each other, communicating, affirming, and reciprocating. There is a book called \"Training Levels\" which is really great. The basic idea is that you never ever use negative reinforcement, you can do everything you need to simply by using positive reinforcement and capturing behaviour. When you teach your dog the central game of Training Levels they learn that training itself is a game they can win at, and so when you start training they immediately are playing the game of figuring out what you want and then giving it to you. \n\nTraining your dog will give you tonnes of time to connect and lots of cool tricks to show off later. Other good ideas are to make walking your dog a very regular and predictable part of your routine, make sure you feed good food, and brush your dog twice a week. That last one is mostly to keep you from having massive dust bunnies running around.",
            "When I am sad I like to watch sad movies. Maybe watch a sad one and cuddle with the pup. Dogs generally love to cuddle. \n\nI\u2019m sorry about everything. It\u2019s more than okay to be sad and express your emotions. I\u2019m sure the dog is sad and confused too. Just go slow with her and pet her, don\u2019t try to pick her up or move her if she\u2019s nervous.\n\nYou can PM me if you have any other questions. I\u2019m a vet tech and I love dogs. I\u2019m happy to help if needed.",
            "Ok, so Reddit once again puts me in tears and I'm sorry for your loss. Anyways, what other redditors have been saying, take all of the dogs stuff from whereever the dogs stuff ended up and whatever is unusable, get rid of. Also, try to find the dogs records of the vet and stuff so you can see what kind of treatment he's gotten in the past. Dogs are very set on routines too and most like to play and run. Some like to be hugged but not all. After awhile, you'll get used to her and they'll get used to you. Most things that you need anyways you can even find at places like Wal-Mart. It's a good start that you were able to get her to come to you. For me, it was I had a lot of I guess not really trauma but sort of trauma with dogs in the past but then I slowly got used to them especially with my boy and you'll eventually get used to her.\nEdit: One of my brothers died before I was born so I guess I kind of relate to this in a way. Honestly, it's tough with any loss. The pain never fully goes away. Someday I hope your able to look at the past, not at what happened to him but at the memories you two shared. Also, remember that his dog is grieving too. She just lost someone who has been the center of her world her whole life.",
            "I'm a cat person myself.  Dogs are too high maintenance for me, but I do like dogs.\n\nMy neighbors' dogs love me because I treat them like cats.  They are smaller, think terriers instead of Labs.  I just let them sit on my lap and scratch behind their ears and under their chins like I would a cat.  They LOVE IT.  Sometimes I accidentally call them \"kitty\", but they don't care.\n\nOne big difference with dogs and cats are bellies.  I can get my cats in the mood for a belly rub, because I love the soft furry kitty belly.  Dogs LOVE belly rubs.  They will lay on their backs all day if you rub their bellies and be happy as clams.  No fear of being bear trapped when kitty has had enough.\n\nDon't be afraid to treat dogs like cats.  They eat up the affection.  The biggest differences are the baths and the walks.  I've never bathed a cat, and cats are happy home bodies.\n\nThe fact that you'd get on the floor for your doggo niece shows you will be great to her.  I'm sure she loves you already.",

Dogs are love. The net return on your time investment will be worth it especially since it was your brothers dog. Also worth thinking about, that dog also lost its best friend when it lost your brother. Most dogs are smart enough to understand and feel loss. That dog and you can comfort each other right now. You're both in pain. \n\nShowing kindness is healing. \n\nDogs love to be pet on the top of their heads and love ear rubs and chest rubs and side rubs and back rubs and belly rubs. \n\nDogs love a walk 2 times a day. Once in the morning and once at night. They also love doggy doors so they can go to the bathroom whenever they want. If there's no doggy door then you'll need to let them out 2 times a day in addition to 2 walks. \n\nDogs need an ok space for them to lay down and be undisturbed. Lay a blanket on a spot on the couch or bed or get them their own doggy bed in each room. \n\nDogs love food both meat and kibble. In fact mixing their diet with both carbs and meat is ideal. \n\nDogs need a safe way to socialize with other dogs (ie the dog park). Its worht going to a doggy obedience training class at petsmart to learn how to communicate with your dog so that you two can know how to get along. \n\nMost dog behavior problems are actually an owner behavior problem that is reflected in the dog. They are easy to resolve once you know what's going on. Take a class with your dog friend and it will show you so much. \n\nDogs love to have something to get excited about. Even if it's just you coming home. \n\nDogs need a monthly heartworm prevention pill such as trifexis. They also need 1 or 2 vet visits a year to check on their health and renew their trifexis prescription. \n\nDogs need to know that you love and accept them.

Heres some tips. \n\nBe aware of your body language(dogs are hyper aware of body language), try to be non threatening/relaxed as you build that initial relationship.  Squat  6 feet away with a treat and try and get her to come over.  If she doesn\u2019t, leave it on the ground for her and walk away.  \n\nShe\u2019s dealing with a lot right now so just try to be supportive and don\u2019t push her too hard.  Think of a dog as a much more coordinated and empathetic 2 year old.   Just because they might eat cat turds doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have emotional depth.  Lol\n\nGet some treats(doesn\u2019t have to be treats it can just be kibble) and keep a couple in your pocket.  Whenever you get home from a trip to the store or see her behaving well(laying quietly where you want her to, etc) give her one.  \n\nIt will help build a happy association with you and reinforce good behavior.  \n\nDefinitely go over the basic commands with treat rewards so she knows to listen to you, and you know what she knows.   \n\nGive her little tasks through the day to come, sit, stay, & etc, to keep her somewhat engaged.   You can play a couple games with her like the 3 cups where one has a treat under it and you shuffle them around and let her try and pick the right one.   \n\nTake her out on a walk every day, it\u2019s good for her and you.   Just don\u2019t let her pull you around.  You\u2019re in charge.  Don\u2019t continue walking until she stops pulling.  It might take a few weeks if consistent training but she\u2019ll pick it up.  \n\nDon\u2019t yell, but practice a firm but even \u201ccommand voice\u201d so she can tell when you are issuing commands instead of just giving attention.   Dogs are a lot like people in that a yelling angry leader does not command a lot of respect other than to get them to stop yelling.  Think Captain America giving orders, firm but even, he\u2019s in command.  \n\nDon\u2019t let her dictate meal times and make sure you eat first.  Try and be as consistent as possible with the times and don\u2019t feed her from your plate or she\u2019ll never stop begging.  Dogs can\u2019t tell time but they sure do know when you\u2019re late to feed them. \n\nI recommend Kong toys, they have stood up to my buddy\u2019s pit bulls abuse pretty well, and those dogs are like 50% jaw muscle.  My dog hasn\u2019t even made a dent in his.  Slap a little peanut butter on it as a reward if they are extra good.",

He was coming from a couple who had divorced and we're both living in condos so the dog ended up caged a lot of the time when they weren't around.\n\n\nHe had a number of idiosyncrasies, like not socializing too well with other dogs, staying in corners out of sight, or even just barking at odd noises outside that work quickly normal.\n\n\n\nI need advice of somebody I knew who owned a small dog, I started taking him to a dog park that had a lot of other small dogs in it plus an off-leash area where he can interact safely away from traffic.\n\n\n\nOnce there, I only walked him around on leash and the other dogs we're pretty respectful of them and would come up to him but when he was a little bit shy they wouldn't push it. But eventually he found the situation tolerable and started interacting with the dogs so he became a fixture at the off-leash Park a couple of times a week, being a cute yorkie who is a lot of fun to be around.\n\n\nIt's actually scary how much a part of our life and our friends lives that he became and we were always asked when we were visiting friends family Etc if we were bringing the dog.\n\n\n\nHit me look daunting now to be responsible for a dog and to see if you can find a way to integrate him or her into your life.

Also if you have any close friends good idea is to introduce the dog to them as well. My friend group is basically my dogs friend group as well, we are all one big pack to her.",
            "There are a lot of comments here so this may have been mentioned, but make sure you look up foods and plants that are toxic to dogs! If you ask at the vet, I'm sure they'd have a pamphlet or something to give you, but there's also a lot of information online.",
            "Oh, I'm so sorry. Whether or not you decide to keep her depends on whether or not the work is worth it and if you can handle having a beloved one's pet. Some people find it very difficult to keep one on, but if it is healing for you (versus triggering more grief) I recommend it. Dogs can be very good animals to have around\u2014especially when you are sad.\n\nYou know? Dogs can be gross, but my anti-dog cat-only boyfriend married me, and they are his favorite animal now. If she is a nice dog, and you decide to hang onto her you may end up changing your mind about dogs, too.\n\nIt sounds like you have a very good breed mix and ended up with her at a fantastic age for a lab. Labs tend to be high energy dogs that don't calm down until they are older (5 or 6). 5ish is actually an excellent age to adopt most any dog. You end up with an animal that has mellowed out and usually has some training, but is still young with hopefully many years to give love.\n\nShe'll probably need a lot of exercise (labs are athletic dogs), but that can be very good for both of you. 2-3 walks a day would be a good start and give you both time to get to know one another and bond. She also sounds like a wonderful dog to go on hikes with, but start walking her first in places you are well-acquainted with to see if there are things you may need to work with her over (etc - leash pulling, car chasing, aggression to other dogs, fear of strangers, etc...).\n\nIf you run into training/behavior issues with her, it's good to check around for a trainer/behaviorist. If you have vet records for her, contact the vet your brother used and ask for referrals for one\u2014or whoever you end up using for a vet.\n\nIf she is a mellow/well-trained dog who is in shape and you can tolerate it, buy her a good harness and hands-free leash (they loop around the waist and usually are padded) and try taking her on runs. Labs are supposed to be amazing running buddies when they are in good shape and well-trained. I personally prefer the brand RuffWear. They are really well-made leashes/harness/collars with lifetime guarantees. Kurgo is another brand that is decent.\n\nThe crap eating can be avoided if you clean the yard daily (which is a good idea to begin with). Pet stores sell little shovels/scoops for that. If you are in an apartment, you'll want a roll of compostable doggie poop bags so you can pick up after her on walks.  Of course, that doesn't guarantee she won't eat random poop you come upon on walks, but that can usually be avoided on leash.\n\nBathing a dog like her (I'm guessing she's short-haired) is no big deal. Get a good dog shampoo and a nice spray extension for the shower/tub. Labs usually aren't very smelly to begin with, and you get used to pet odor when you live with dogs. Most dogs do not need to be bathed more than once every other month or so\u2014depending on the season. I only wash my clowns once during winter.\n\nYou are probably in shock and so is she. Give yourself 3 weeks together before making a choice either way. If you feel good with her and can keep up her care, it could be a very rewarding arrangement for both of you, but it is totally okay if it is overwhelming and you need to rehome her. You can help her find the best forever family if that happens and should not feel guilty as you are still going to do the best by her if that needs to happen.\n\nWhatever happens, this pup is very lucky to have ended up with a family member who cares about her well being. Some people are so overcome with chaos/grief they have difficulty making it priority to take care of their late ones' pets or find them a good home. I wish you both gentle healing.",
            "Last year my girlfriend and I came into ownership of a 90LB lurcher. He\u2019s massive and full of energy, I can almost guarantee he\u2019s got more energy than any other dog on this planet. When he was just showed up I thought he was cute but didn\u2019t expect to own him.\n\nI felt really bad that he had to sleep outside so I had to bathe him. He was dirty as hell and deathly afraid of the water. I had to strip down and sit in the bathtub with him and just hold him so that he would feel more comfortable.\n\nThat moment was all it took for him to be latched onto me and vice versa. Ever since then he follows me around as if I\u2019m his mom and he would probably kill anything that threatened us. The bonding got even deeper when I would sit down and train him to sit, lay down, shake, roll over, etc. \n\nBelieve it or not, most of the bonding came from the moments where he was frustrating me. You can love that dog. Take her for a ride, go to the park, go on a walk, get a rope toy and play tug of war.\n\nAs for takin  care of her basic needs, it\u2019s mostly pretty easy. Feed her and give her a ton of love. Dogs are all different so I obviously can\u2019t give any advice on her in particular, but one thing they all have in common is the capacity and and need for love and admiration. If you bond with that dog, you\u2019ll feel silly that you ever thought you couldn\u2019t.",
            "Sorry for your loss. \n\nI think most people who never had a dog think they don't like dogs. Labs are great and should be pretty laid back by 5 but will take some settling in time.  You might change your mind about dogs after a few months. I bet you will. And it's ok to like both cats and dogs. \n\nBest to you in this rough time.",

            "> Dogs eat stupid crap & throw it up\n\nAs someone who has both cats and dogs throughout their life, cats throw up *way fucking more* than dogs. Just sayin'\n\nAlso, humans have an incredible symbiotic relationship with dogs that has formed over tens of thousands of years. I think if you give her a chance, you'll be surprised just how much you fall in love with her over the next few months. In my experience, cat people who \"just don't like dogs\" usually have never had an opportunity to truly bond with a dog. It's a bond that's seriously only second to romantic partners and children.",
            "Haven\u2019t been through every comment, but it looks like most bases are being covered. I\u2019d only add this: talk to her. I love cats and dogs. Most animals, really. And one thing about dogs you can\u2019t get from most any other animal is verbal interaction. Tell her you miss him too. Ask her questions. Ask her how she\u2019s doing. Have full on conversations with the assumption she can perfectly understand every word you say. You\u2019ll probably be surprised how much she picks up. And second the hugs. Would propose a motion for cuddles for hours. Sorry for your loss.",

That was 3 years ago. When I finish at my job for the day I can't wait to go home and see him again :) (One cat is still holding out; the rest like him just fine.)",

            "You buckle up and love her like your brother did until her time comes. Do the research and have patience. Taking in another life is never easy, but I'm sure your brother is happy with you caring for her. I know I would be. I probably would've left her with one of my sisters, because my brother can't even take care of himself (25yrs, still living at home with no job), but that's beside the point. You got one more gift from him, years more with her. Cherish it.",
            "Labs are really good dogs as long as she works with your other pets and your schedule/situation id keep it because if they have to go back to a pound it usually doesn't turn out very well. Remember the dog is going through the exact same thing you are. My grandma recently passed and her cat that has to be about 17 years old was on my grandmas bed crying just staring at where my grandma slept I went in and comforted him then he went to sleep.",
            "Labs love to have a \u201cjob\u201d. I used to put a backpack on my chocolate lab and weigh it down so he would get tired more quickly on our walks because he always had more energy than me. Also invest in a \u201cchuck it\u201d it\u2019s a stick that allows you to pick up the slobbery ball without touching the nasty thing and it helps you throw further so the dog will run more. Adult labs are generally easy to get along with and shouldn\u2019t be much trouble as long as they get regular exercise. Good luck! I bet this will go better than you think. My dog is great to have around when you\u2019re sad.",
            "This might sound silly, but explain to doggo what happened to her dad just like you would to a kid. She may not understand every word, but I beleive somehow dogs can understand things far more than we give them credit for. Everytime I explain to my dog that some service person is coming to work on the house, he doesn\u2019t bark at them. If I forgot to explain it to him beforehand, he barks like crazy when they arrive. Somehow he understands what I\u2019m telling him. If nothing else, for you and your new doggo, it will be a cathartic experience.",

            "Wow, I'm sorry for your loss. I'm generally a cat person too (I also really get along with birds and horses), so I can empathize with struggling to socialise with a dog. But labs are pretty friendly, so your brother's dog will probably warm up to you quickly. Like other people said, feeding her and playing with her will be important. She might also be very scared and worried because she doesn't know where your brother went or knows he's passed and is upset about this; if there are some clothes, blankets, or other belongings of his you could put by her bed or something, that might make her feel more comforted. She also might be scared because her home life has suddenly changed (moving can be pretty stressful for animals). If you can get any of her toys, blankets, food, etc from your brother's place, it might make her feel more at home in yours.\n\nBest of luck to you both. \u2665\ufe0f",

If you make sure to go for a quick walk before you go out they'll snooze while you're out, and are less likely to get into anything they're not supposed to. \n\n\nEventually you'll learn his quirks, and you'll find them endearing (even if they're really, really dumb).\n\n\nIn time you'll find that taking good care of your dog just feels really good.

Stay low to the ground and keep your head at the same level. Read to the dog. Seriously, dogs like to hear you talk and listening builds it\u2019s intelligence even if it can\u2019t understand what you\u2019re saying. Mental stimulation like tricks will help. Not just shake and play dead, but actual jobs like bringing your shoes or holding the mail for a minute.

If you think it's best for the dog to find it another home, your brother would care more about it being safe and happy than about who takes care of it.\n\nThat said, as long as you feed it and take it for walks, it should be fine.

I couldn't hear anything except the alarm clock.\n\n-I called 911 to ask for a welfare check. They said they would send someone over. Its been an hour so far and I havent heard anything back.\n\nWhat else can I do? I'm concerned and anxious and dont know what else to do. She told me she's alone and she was so out of breath just trying to go up the curb to the sidewalk last night, I'm scared she may have fallen.\n\n\nUPDATE: I heard a lot of sirens go by but since I live right next to a fire dept and a hospital, I wasn't sure If it was for my neighbor or unrelated issue. I went by to check on her. The alarm clock stopped. But she still didnt answer. I will try to find out what happened.\n\n\nUPDATE 2: Everyone is wanting an update and so am I. I am getting different answers on who I am supposed to call for an update. Do I call dispatch again? A non-emergency number? My local PD?\n\nI'm going to try and answer the most common questions:\n\n-I have crazy social anxiety and I'm scared If I try to just walk in her place or break a window inside, its gonna make things a lot worse or awkward. I'm worried if I show too much concern like knocking on her door again or calling someone, people will think I'm crazy.\n\n-I plan on walking by again to check on her.\n\nUPDATE 3: I went by to check again. No answer. The alarm clock was off so I want to safely assume that she either turned it off that night when someone did a welfare check or someone else did and helped her. I called two local PD's in my area but since it's Sunday I've been getting redirected to answering machines. Im going to try again Monday morning because at this point I dont think knocking on her door every few hours is going to do anything. Another redditor commented that since she has a hard time walking she might not want to use the energy to come to the door for just a check up.\n\nLAST UPDATE: SHE'S OK!!! My local PD finally called me back around 3 today. I asked for a follow-up regarding the welfare check on Saturday night. They said someone came by and she answered and shes okay. He adult son was there too. The reason for the alarm clock going off all day was because due to her limited immobility she couldn't reach to turn it off. \n\nIt raises more questions if I'm being honest. Like, why didnt her son turn off the alarm until someone came by? And why did no one answer when I knocked multiple times and called out to her?",

            "I once had a patient who was elderly and lived alone. The mail person noticed she hadn't gotten her mail for 2 days and called police for a welfare check. Turned out she had fallen 2 days prior and couldn't move. She was alive,  though probably wouldn't have been much longer if the mail person hadn't noticed. She was in bad shape and only held on for a few more months. \n\nI urge anyone with an elderly neighbor to get a relative/ contact number from the neighbor of someone to call if you suspect there's an emergency. It's often quicker to call someone's relative and they come over with a key (or give permission to break in) than to wait for a welfare check.",

            "I used to be an emergency dispatcher. Questions for you to run through in your head:\n\n* Is the alarm still going off?\n* Have you been watching for police / fire / EMS arrival next door?\n\nIf the alarm is still going off, and you haven't noticed lights at the neighbor's house (fire/ems will leave them on, police will frequently do a silent rollup to not disturb the neighborhood and make them worry, depending on the PD), then we have some things to do.\n\n* You can contact 911 again for another welfare check, since the alarm is still going off. But I know a lot of people feel that won't get them any answers or a response, which - fair.\n* Is the apartment on the 1st floor? If so, try to sneak a peek through any windows or a balcony sliding door. Same for the 2nd floor.\n* Sometimes you can get an angle to look across the complex, if it's U-shaped or square. Just a thought?\n* Check the door, see if it's locked. I know it sounds silly, but really, check the door.\n* Knock on the door loudly, calling her name. I typically use the toe of my shoe, since my hands won't work for that. It's loud!\n* Finally, is there a super you can contact? Maintenance? A neighbor that may have her key?\n\nBe a *NUISANCE*. Really, if you're this worried? Do it. Especially with the people in your building that could have a key. Another option is to do a non-emergent phone call (don't call 911, call their local number), and ask for a noise-complaint and welfare check on the residence.\n\nIf you know who the key-holder (a person that is authorized to have a key to the apartment, and can let emergency services in) is for the building, then meet the officer at the apartment door with the information. Tell the dispatcher you would like to speak to the officer when he arrives during your call. That way you aren't marked down as simply a 'Reporting Party' and never given the opportunity to get them further information.

            "Before my mom passed away last year, she started having health issues. Lots of fluid buildup, she refused to tell anyone. Congestive heart failure, she refused to believe it. When things were good she looked fairly fit and healthy, but then she'd have a flare or relapse or whatever and things would get bad fast. So since I lived 10+hours away, I just made sure to text, email, call. If I didn't hear from her in 12 hours from sending a message (she hardly slept ever and was always one to respond) then I knew something was wrong. \n\n6 months before she died, I had a situation like that. She did finally answer the phone, groggy and disoriented. I had to call the police department in Virginia, from my home in New Hampshire and explain to them that my mother needed emergency services, and even though I'm not a praying person, I prayed to every god that's ever been imagined that they would take me at my word. Thankfully they did. She was in the hospital for a month from that episode. \n\nBut that happened twice altogether. The other time my brother was in the area and broke into her apartment and found her passed out in her chair, sitting in her own excrement, because she didn't have the energy to get out of the chair.\n\nShe was late 60s, not even an age I would consider significantly old. Just health issues that would take a sudden turn bad, and enough pride and stubbornness to choke a horse. Now I'm always hesitant to trust people when they don't seem well but swear they are fine. Because I miss the fuck out of my mom and I wish she hadn't been so damn stubborn.",

            "About 20 years ago, the company I worked for provided staff to a larger company.  There were about 20 of us onsite doing various lower level IT roles.  One of my colleagues, called Jim, was due to start a new role for this larger company in a team that none of us had ever been asked to work in.  We were really pleased for him because he was a lovely guy and thoroughly deserved it and of course it meant opportunities for the rest of us once Jim showed them that we were capable people.  I remember the Friday he finished in our team he was really happy and looking forward to his new role on the Monday.  But then he didn\u2019t turn up, or even call, which was completely out of character for him.  We tried calling him but he didn\u2019t answer.  That afternoon we decided to go check on him.  I went since it was kind of on my way home.  He lived opposite a depot for traffic cops so I asked a couple of them to come with me - they helped me to get past the main door of his apartment block and we got to his front door.  You could tell the heating was on but we couldn\u2019t see or hear him.  They were reluctant to do much more since they were just traffic cops, so we left it at that.  The next day he still didn\u2019t turn up so one of my colleagues called Rob went with two proper cops, and they kicked his door down.  They found Jim\u2019s body in his bathroom.  We found out later that Jim was epileptic and they said he had had a fit and, I believe, choked to death on his own vomit.  They said it had happened sometime over the weekend so it\u2019s not like we could have saved him anyway.  Poor guy, such a waste and so sad.  I often find myself thinking about him - he had this beautiful, soft Scottish accent, was always smiling and had this twinkle in his eyes.  I didn\u2019t go to his funeral because it was up in Scotland - I wish I had, with the benefit of hindsight and maturity I know that I should have.  I never met his parents or got to tell them what a great guy their son was and I really regret that.  Today, I cannot even recall his exact surname 100%, but I would still recognise him if I saw a photo of him.\nI think Rob had a lot of issues after that and I always wonder how much finding Jim like that contributed.",

This kind of program is run slightly differently in each area, but it's often through the fire department. A computer or human calls the elder on their phone at the same time every day. If they don't answer, a welfare check is called on them immediately. This program is either free or a very nominal charge, like $5/ month. \n\n\nAnother option is to purchase a keybox and install it in a discrete location. These are combination lock boxes that you put the door key in. I assume she would want you to have the combo. But also contact ems through their non-emergency number to give them the location and combination of the lockbox. \n\n\nA third thing you can help her do is get in contact with social services and see if she qualifies for home services. There's usually a county or state-level program that pays for the elder to have home services. Whether she qualifies and for how many hours depends on things like her abilities and income.

            "1) Possession and distribution are illegal. You have to be caught in possession or distributing the weed. \n\n2) It isn\u2019t illegal to *say* you are smoking weed. But you could be lying. \n\n3) Law enforcement has to have probable cause to check Joe Rogan. They have to know where he is, and either catch him doing an illegal act so they can check him, or get a search warrant to look for weed. \n\n4) It costs a lot of money to conduct a police bust. Law enforcement has limited budgets and has to allocate resources to get the most bang for their buck. There is also a public relations component to it. If a police leader wherever in Texas Joe Rogan is decided to go through the process of getting a warrant, and since Joe Rogan has a big audience, he probably has a big home and/or broadcast studio, so the police will need a good number of officers to conduct a thorough search. If they find anything, it probably won\u2019t be that much to charge Joe Rogan with a significant crime, and Joe Rogan can hire great lawyers to defend him and can publicly rant about the police harassing him over a joint. Rogan can bring a lot of negative publicity to the police department. \n\n5) Often times, drug enforcement is a tool to suppress groups of people that police and politicians want to target for various reasons. Joe Rogan doesn\u2019t fall into those groups. Joe Rogan doesn\u2019t fit a certain \u201cprofile\u201d that law enforcement assumes are likely to commit more serious crimes.\n\nThink of it like speeding. Law enforcement usually selectively enforces speed limits. When they catch someone, the penalty is usually a fine. But most speeders aren\u2019t pursued for breaking speed limit laws.",

We joked that reddit will have the answer for us. \n\nSo, am I gross or is she too conservative?",

            "A while ago there was a campaign about it that went into televisions here in Brazil, it was called \"fa\u00e7a xixi no banho\", basically it was for children to help out the environment, to save the Atlantic forest, it went into details of how much water is used up when you flush and the fact it's drinkable water that's wasted; I always thought about it as a way to save water and it baffles me that some people do not think about it.\n\n[Here is the commercial used for the campaign](https://youtu.be/1KE3mRyHn1E?si=aZUsWqASec3HyLNj)\n\n[Here's the subtitled version](https://streamable.com/5nmu3y) for those of you that don't speak/understand portuguese- made by u/JVPMBR",

            "Peeing in the shower is so pedestrian. If you want to level up in life, invite others to shower with you, then pee on them. This is how you assert your dominance over others or just have a laugh with a loved one. Really more about the type of person you want to be I guess.",

Don't forget to smash that upvote button, subscribe, and be sure to share this comment with all of your friends and family so that we can spread the word.\n\nEDIT 2: Some people have thoughtfully pointed out that I might be dehydrated. After careful consideration of that possibility, I realized something. I ALWAYS pee before I get in the shower. Basically, my routine is to wake up, drink a glass of water, take a dump (I've trained myself to drop a hot one first thing in the morning, that way I don't have to worry about it for the rest of the day), at which time I also pee, and then I hop in the shower. So, that's probably why I don't really pee in the shower very often - it's part of my routine to pee just before getting in the shower.",

Then I asked how they could possibly reason that was less disgusting than peeing in the shower vs pooping and they said the pee touches you but the poop doesn\u2019t. But I said that it does because you mash it with your foot and it gets all in your toes! Then she said her foot gets clean when the soap goes down her body anyway. \n\nI had no words.",
