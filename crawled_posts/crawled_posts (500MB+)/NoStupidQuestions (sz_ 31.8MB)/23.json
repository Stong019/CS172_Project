But, because of their beliefs I've never been vaccinated for anything, god knows how I'm still alive. But, i'm a senior in high school now with a car, a license, and money of my own. I'd assume that I can get them on my own but I've just never had a conversation with anyone about the subject. I'm also afraid I'd go somewhere that up charges vaccines way more than somewhere just down the street. Any advice would be awesome \n\nAlso, I know rule 5 says no medical advice, but this seems less than \"How do I treat \\_\\_\\_\\_ disease\" and more of \"Everyone does this and I don't what should I do?\" I'm going to get vaccinated but it's more of a matter of where do I go to get vaccines.\n\nEdit: I live in the United States, specifically Ohio\n\nEdit 2: I have an appointment in a few weeks to get my shots! My mom was especially angry but my dad said because I\u2019m 18 he doesn\u2019t care that much.

            "Hello Ethan,\n\n\\[Addendum:  A good link here [History of Vaccines](https://www.historyofvaccines.org/timeline/all) \\]\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI saw your original question, but there were so many answers and a few of them were conflicting and I just didn't have time to go through every single one of them.\n\nFirst of all, I am a nurse.\n\nWhat happened is once you turn 18, you are considered an adult, and your medical record cannot be accessed by your parents, or anyone else without your written permission.\n\nAnd most colleges that you are hoping to go to next fall will require that you get all these immunizations and most likely you will be barred from living in the dorm if you are missing anything. There are of course those that use \"religious exemption\" and where I worked, we didn't allow them to dorm. They still can go to classes, but if there is any breakout of any diseases on the campus, they are not allowed to show up and they stay home and miss classes until the epidemic is over.\n\nYou are still under your parents' health insurance until you are in your mid 20s \u2013 so as of now, you actually can make an appointment to see your pediatrician/family practice/internist physician. You are getting too old to be seen by a pediatrician, but your current pediatrician probably has known you since birth, so you might as well make the last appointment with him and be sure you get yourself a copy of your medical record. Explained to him that your parents made that decision that prevented you from getting all those immunizations, and now you are of age, and simply you just want to start the course because you are old enough to make that decision on your own.\n\nSo you will be getting hepatitis B, and there will be three shots of that. You will not get them all at the same time of course. Hepatitis B is transmitted through blood or certain bodily fluids. It is an extremely serious disease and many people get liver cancer when they are older. It is one of the first vaccines that is considered \"anticancer\" and since it is transmitted through bodily fluids, a lot of \"Christian parents\" were against it because they thought it would promote sex.  Same with HPV. They said it will promote sex.\n\nThe next one will be chickenpox. It sounds like a benign disease, but when someone your age get chickenpox, it is pretty bad. You get two of that.\n\nMeasles, mumps, and rubella. It is also called MMR. This is the one that made the big news because the crazy English Dr. name Andrew Wakefield many years ago published a story that says the MMR gave children autism. It has been proven untrue, but the real damage was done because the rate of MMR went down so low that countless children came down with measles, etc. Many of them died. It was discovered later that he was gaining financially from that article and JAMA, wanted to kick itself for not thoroughly double checking the submission. It really made them, and it was, and still is, very reputable medical Journal, look bad. Anyway, you get two injections of this. Wakefield is an idiot.\n\nMumps makes a boy very ill. You can become sterile because of it due to the infection of your testicles.\n\nThen you should get Tdap. It is for Tetanus, and whooping cough and diphtheria. Tetanus is something that can kill you if you step on a rusty nail or similar objects. Lockjaw is what they used to call it. It is a very painful death.\n\nEvery year, you ought to get a flu shot, and if you are going to get these shots, you might as well get one, so you do not catch it from your classmate. Having the flu really is awful. People die from it, or from pneumonia. It is a horrible death.\n\nPoliovirus is something you need to be protected from, too. 100 years ago, people basically dropped dead or became paralyzed from it.\n\nYou could also get hepatitis A if you plan to travel to any third world country. Hepatitis A normally does not make a person extremely ill, but nevertheless, some of them can get quite ill and it is transmittable through eating. The person who has hepatitis A may go to the potty, and doesn't wash his hands and basically, you eating his shit, and that is how you catch it.\n\nOne thing you also ought to receive is the HPV vaccine. When it came out about a decade ago, it was determined that the oldest person who should receive this is 27 years old \u2013 but they have increased the age. It will protect you from getting a type of sexually transmitted disease. Many boys/men have this and they don't even know it since there are no tests, and to give it to the girlfriends/wife, and they get cervical cancer. So this is one vaccine that is \"anticancer\" \u2013 along with hepatitis B, because hepatitis B can and have given you liver cancer when you are older.\n\nRead about them here. They are called \"vaccine information statements.\"\n\nHepatitis A [http://www.immunize.org/vis/hepatitis\\_a.pdf](http://www.immunize.org/vis/hepatitis_a.pdf)\n\nHepatitis B [http://www.immunize.org/vis/hepatitis\\_b.pdf](http://www.immunize.org/vis/hepatitis_b.pdf)\n\nHPV (Papillomavirus) [http://www.immunize.org/vis/hpv.pdf](http://www.immunize.org/vis/hpv.pdf)\n\nFlu vaccine [http://www.immunize.org/vis/flu\\_inactive.pdf](http://www.immunize.org/vis/flu_inactive.pdf)\n\nMMR [http://www.immunize.org/vis/mmr.pdf](http://www.immunize.org/vis/mmr.pdf)\n\nPolio Vaccine [http://www.immunize.org/vis/vis\\_polio\\_ipv.asp](http://www.immunize.org/vis/vis_polio_ipv.asp)\n\nTdap (Tetanus, Diphtheria and pertussis/whooping cough) [http://www.immunize.org/vis/tdap.pdf](http://www.immunize.org/vis/tdap.pdf)\n\nChickenpox [http://www.immunize.org/vis/vis\\_chickenpox.asp](http://www.immunize.org/vis/vis_chickenpox.asp)\n\nThe only one you need to know about is the Tdap. It gives you a sore arm and a couple of days worth of fever afterward. It is normal. Just take Tylenol or Advil afterward. These vaccines are generally very safe but just like anything else in the world, they are side effect and there are risks. But the benefits outweigh the risks to the extreme. Just like when you are a passenger in the car, there is a slight chance that you can get into an accident and die \u2013 but you still need to go somewhere so you choose what is best for you.\n\nPS I use a voice dictation program so some odd words may have crept in but I looked it over and I didn't see any.",

            "You mentioned living in the US and having some kind of health insurance.\n\nGood news! One of the ACA (aka obamacare) rules is that all health insurance must cover \"preventative medicine\" like vaccines at 100%. Meaning you shouldn't have to pay a penny for the shots themselves. Most of these can be done at your local pharmacy too.\n\nFor what vaccines you should get, I'd recommend talking to a doctor first, but this should give you a good idea on what you've missed. Keep in mind that some of these NEED to be spaced out properly to be effective. \n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/child-adolescent.html\n\nI would personally recommend making a doctor's appointment to come up with a plan. The good news is that your yearly physical is also covered 100%. However, many doctors are strict about keeping this appointment to ONLY discussing your yearly physical itself. Any other topics (\n(POSSIBLY including discussing what vaccines you should take and when) require a separate \"office visit\" that is covered under a separate benefit. This isn't your Dr being a dick. This is a way to prevent people from scheduling a \"free\" checkup and trying to get all sorts of other stuff done that isn't supposed to be covered. ",

Assuming you're American here: if you have health insurance it'll very likely be covered completely. If you don't have insurance, prices probably vary across the country but I think I paid thirty bucks last time I had to pay out of pocket.\n\nThere are also shots that many people get as babies or kids which give you immunity to various things for most (if not all) of your life. These include things like chicken pox (varicella), measles/mumps/rubella (three different diseases but generally given in a combination MMR vaccine), tetanus, and human papillomavirus (HPV). You should talk to a doctor about getting these. They will probably want to do blood tests called titres, to see whether you already have immunity to any of these things (for example, in case your parents did get you some kind of vaccination when you were very little and don't remember). If you have no immunity then you'll be scheduled to get the shots.\n\nThere's no such thing as too late for most of them. I had my MMRs when I was a kid but didn't have the records, and I had to show proof of immunity for my health care related studies at college. I got the titre done and it turned out I had antibodies against measles and rubella, but the mumps immunity had worn off, so I had to get the shot again as an adult.\n\nHPV is one of the most easily transmissible STDs, and can be carried in the body for years without symptoms. The vaccine has typically been given to preteens and young teenagers before they become sexually active. Again, talk to a doctor about it if you want this one, and be honest about your sexual history.",

You won\u2019t really process it much, because your body doesn\u2019t know what to think of feeling pressure under the skin, so for me, it just felt weird, not painful. \nAs a kid, I could feel how cold the vaccine was as it went in, but when I went in a few weeks ago, I didn\u2019t feel anything after the needle injection, so the fluid itself didn\u2019t cause any discomfort. \nMost shots afterwards are pretty painless and don\u2019t bleed much/at all. So when I got those three shots recently, I had no issues afterwards with two of them. The third one was a bit of an issue because the nurse put the needle in too far. It just felt like a harder punch during the vaccine, and my arm aches really weirdly afterwards, but I\u2019m all good now! \nSome people feel uncomfortable with the needles, so I\u2019d also recommend looking away when they first go into the skin, and then if you feel fine afterwards, you\u2019re probably all good to watch if you want. \n\nI\u2019m gonna get follow up shots for a couple of them soon (one in a month, another in six), so your doctor (or whoever you get the vaccines from) might suggest something similar for you. \n\nGood luck!",

For instance, if there are thousand kids in a population and 950 get vaccinated, the chances of the remaining 50 getting the disease decreases dramatically, primarily because the incidence of the disease itself decreases. Simply put, to fall ill, the non-immunised 50 has to catch the infection from someone, and if the remaining 950 are vaccinated, it becomes more difficult for them to do so.

What you explained is an example of observational learning, a concept discovered by Albert Bandura, where the crows learn to imitate a certain behavior in order to receive a treat, because they've previously seen a model, similar to themselves (well in this case the model is of the same species, so it makes even more sense that they will copy the behavior) receiving a treat. \n\nEDIT: Don't confuse this with Skinner's operant conditioning theory, because in order operant conditioning to take place, there must be a reinforcement for the action that we're trying to strengthen. The crows that do receive treats (which is a positive reinforcement) are a product of operant conditioning, while those who learn the behavior by observing are not.",

            "That's not the pavlovian response (or, more commonly said, classical conditioning). What you mean is operant conditioning, in which organisms behave the way they do because of reinforcement. But the situation you are explaining is only operant conditioning from the 200 first crows that were trained. Untrained crows seeing it and doing the same is called imitation. But I'm not a ornithologist so I have no idea wether they would imitate the first 200 or not. Still, that situation is not described well. Untrained birds are being exposed to the trained ones in a experimental situation in which you can control the access to reinforcers, for example in a field? Or in a real situation, where the crows are free and others happen to see them? In the latter it would not be smart because you'd have to be always next to the trained birds to give the reinforcers, considering they are still in training. But if they aren't getting treats, the untrained wouldn't associate with the treat, because they already incorporated that behavior without the need of a reinforcer - thus not associating with the reinforcer. Are the crows seeing the others getting reinforced? Or is it just after they already do the behavior without training, just imitating?\nConsidering crows learn by observation, which I think they do, I would guess that they would imitate their trained peers in a situation in which they see the trained birds getting treats. But only if they get treats, too, after picking the cigarette butts. Because that's not a behavior that's pleasurable, that helps or that eliminates anything that would bother them (pain, an obstacle, etc). See, learning that you can use a stick as a tool is useful. Or that making a fire makes bees go away. But picking cigarette butts is not.\nBut I think I get what you mean now. They would start imitating the trained ones in a real life situation and all birds would do the same because of imitation, right? I don't think that'd happen, because as I said, that's not a useful behavior for birds. Something like learning to drop a walnut to make it crack open gives access to food, which picking cigarette butts does not. \nBut there are awesome articles on how teaching one animal can make their culture change. Theres this article (I think its called animal traditions behavioral inheritance in evolution) in which monkeys that live in a litoral area see the researchers doing something in the water (I don't remember exactly what, but I'm going to say its washing their hands in seawater). But these monkeys, even though they live in a litoral area, they were closer to the forest. But after seeing the researchers in the sea, they start imitating them. Monkeys started to get more close to the sea, and the whole culture changed: they started swimming and living more close to the beach. By the next generation, babies would play in the water. Their culture would change and start to revolve towards the water.\nAnd finally I get to use my experimental behavior analysis knowledge.",

So over time, I believe, they got more odd stones than butts, but still plenty",

Did the paramedic that saved his life kept coming to the hospital, couldn\u2019t believe that he made it. Paramedic went on to become an orthopedic surgeon and stayed friends with our family for years. I did write along with him as a high school student well he was still a paramedic and actually became an emergency physician myself. When this paramedic graduated from medical school my father presented him with the watch he was wearing during the accident. This was many years ago \u2013 I don\u2019t recall if the watch had to be repaired but I know it worked but was still scraped up. \n\nThe years went by and about five years ago I got an email from his wife. Somehow she had tracked me down and I knew right away that this wonderful man who gave us all of these extra years with my dad had passed away and sure enough, she wanted to return the watch. We met up again when she was in town - they moved out of my state when he left for residency many years ago and way before Facebook or the internet was even a thing.

            "So a lot of people are missing some crucial pieces here, but here's the whole summary: \n\n1. Unexpected things. A lot of people did touch on this. Sometimes the patient prior to you drops a bomb mid-appt or even worse, when your hand is on the door to leave. If someone is here for wrist pain and then goes \"oh yeah doc...my chest hurts real bad every time I exercise.\" You cannot ignore that, they could have a life threatening concern. So now your 15 min appt becomes 30. \n\n\n2. Other people running late. I don't mean just patients. A clinic involves a LOT of people. Patients, front desk, nurses, MAs, etc etc. If one runs late, so do the others.\n\n\n3. Paperwork. Y'all are seriously underestimating how much paperwork needs to be done. Every single patient has to have a note typed out, a diagnosis (usually multiple) made, everything you order has to be justified and associated with a diagnosis (even things like flu shots or med reorders), every thing you order has to be confirmed as correct, meds and lab work have to be confirmed to the correct insurance, you might have to get a print out of your referrals/visit summary. Doctors work very very hard to do as much of this as they go, but it cannot always be done. Also, lots of people get annoyed if a doctor is typing while they talk, so then you cannot do any of this as you go.\n\n\n3. They don't make the schedule. The majority of doctors are not in charge of booking patients, they hire people specifically for that. Doctors get over booked, and because the clinic or hospital they work for cares about $$$, they make doctors see as many people as possible. Doctors usually have set amounts of time depending on the appt type, and you can't always just add a random 10 minutes here or there. I promise you the majority of doctors would rather have more time to talk to you too and aren't trying to just see you as a cash cow, but it is literally out of their control. \n\n\n4. You can (technically) wait to be seen, they can't wait to see people. Does it suck if you've been living with indigestion and your appointment to finally see the doctor about it got canceled? Absolutely and it's okay to be mad about that. But nobody died from an upset stomach, and as aforementioned, late patients simply have no room in the schedule because it's tightly regulated. If what you tell the office you need to be seen for is important enough the doctor won't cancel your appointment. (And now you're why the next patient is being seen late, but see 1. Unexpected Stuff)\n\n\n5. A lot of offices still really push to get late people in. We really want to see you, and we'll do what we can, but it isn't always possible. \n\n\n6. Doctors have lives too. Every late appointment makes it harder and harder to get home on time, eat lunch, pee, etc. Doctors don't owe you their well being. \n\n\nI probably missed some stuff but the way medical offices run is a pretty complex issue and while it could be handled better, a lot of it has nothing to do with the doctor. If your doctor always runs late in that bothers you, go see a new one, but I promise most of them are trying their best to keep everybody happy, including themselves.",
            "A good doctor will not rush through a patient that requires a bit more time. \n\nIf you aren\u2019t that type of patient consider yourself blessed. \n\nIf/when you become that type of patient, feel blessed you have a doctor that gives you that time.",
            "Previous patients coming in late is part of the reason that you have to wait 30 minutes for the doctor",
            "Because the doctor is providing a service and there is a limited amount of time in their day.   If they take you late, then that can affect every other patient for the day.   \nYou have no connection to the other patients, so you don't get a pass for inconveniencing them.   \n\nThe doctor, on the other hand has to see the patients.  Everyone at the office is connected to the doctor.   If you want to cancel your appointment because the doctor is late, you can do that.   If you want to see a different doctor, you can do that, too.   \n\nDoctors have emergencies, just like the rest of us.   They can't time travel, so you either wait for them to see you, or you don't wait.  \nYou can choose, too.   If you have an emergency, just reschedule.   \n\n\nIf you go to the grocery store, and they don't have milk, you can wait until they get some, or you can go to a different store.   You can't make them produce milk.",
            "Seems it\u2019s already been answered. I experienced sort of a miniature version of this when I was a pizza delivery driver, I served a large campus and it would not be uncommon for me to have multiple, sometimes up to and occasionally over a dozen people\u2019s orders with me. Usually they\u2019d be spread out over 4 or 5 buildings and I\u2019d coordinate it to where people would meet me downstairs at a set time. It would take just one person dragging their feet at the first dorms for the people at the next one to get irritated, and often people would go back to their rooms after a few mins, further compounding the effect. If I had a \u201cperfect\u201d run I could complete it in 15 mins, often it would take 30 mins or more (road time, not total \u201corder to door\u201d time.)",
            "I'm guessing a lot of the commenters here are going to private doctors. In the UK GP appointments  are 10 minutes long. 10 minutes. That's barely enough time to see the patient and assess what's wrong, if they have a patient that needs further testing or urgent care, they have to call a and e, or refer on for further tests etc. Often straight forward appointments can be  short and quick and the doc spends the rest of that time catching up. But they are not going to jeopardize  someone's  health so they can see you on time and will take the time to see that patient and sort out what needs to be done. 10 minutes is a crazy appointment  time but they are human too and what if a patient bursts into tears or gets bad news? They arent exactly  going to countdown and say right times up at the end of the 10 minutes. Just wait the damn 30 minutes.",
            "This happened to me a few weeks ago. I was the first appt of the day at 8am. The doors were unlocked around 8:05am. I sat in the waiting room until around 8:15am. I was then brought into a room and finally saw my doctor at 8:40am. So if the doc was late getting to his first PT, of course the rest of the day will be delayed too.",
            "Simplest answer... because their time is more valuable than yours. I mean that literally. Insurance companies reimburse based on appointment type, not time spent on that appointment. So, if you are late, you are literally costing that doctor/practice money in terms of lost productivity. That is why in many practices if you are late X minutes (or don't show) you get charged for that appointment anyway. But if they are late, you will still be seen, but they have had to see patients before you that required a few extra minutes of their time which backed up the schedule.",
            "For what it's worth, I play a \"problematic patient\" for doctor training, and it's increased my respect for how much doctors care and \\*want\\* nothing more than to see you, on time, give you as much time as they can, and genuinely help you, and how frustrated they are at all the things that get in the way.\n\nOf course, if you run late, they still want to help you, but you've now likely made them late for other patients, and they may have to short change other patients for your time. So you are both someone they want to help and someone who has made it harder for them to help both you and others.\n\nAnd if there's one things doctors get the MOST frustrated at, it's patients who make it extra difficult to help them.\n\nAlso, I've learned that for most doctors, \"problematic\" means:\n\n\\* Habitually Late and/or Distracted / On Phone\n\n\\* Bringing up really concerning things at the end of the fifteen minutes. (\"Oh, one last thing: my heart hurts really badly...\")\n\n\\* Demanding treatments that aren't really justified (\"Someone on the internet said I need an MRI!\")\n\n\\* Unhelpful parents who are aggressive, interrupt their children or won't otherwise won't let the care provider talk directly with the child\n\n\\* Number One: Opioid addicts who are only seeking medication and who drift from provider to provider, but won't talk about the addiction.",

            "I used to have to go to the doctors (in a hospital cause that's where the specialist was) every couple of weeks, sometimes more, for a pretty damn serious eye condition I had.\n\nAnything but pitch black would be too bright for me to handle, so I'd end up sitting in the waiting rooms with a thick dark coat over my head and my hands holding my eyes, blocking all of the light, sitting there with my Mum reading a book waiting for my turn.\n\nEvery time we'd be there on time or a little early, for a good 8+ years, and the shortest wait we ever had was multiple (2+) hours.\n\nHundreds of appointments and on not a single one was I seen within even 2 hours of my appointed time. It really begs the question of why and if it's so consistent, why the hell do they not adjust the appointment times to match?\n\nThe amount of discomfort and pain this caused me over those years was horrendous.",
            "There are several reasons for this.\n\nThe first is demand, and this sounds harsh, but the fact is, the doctor's time is far more valuable than yours. Not in some existential sense of worth as a person, but simply that there many people waiting to see the doctor, and not many doctors lacking patients. Your appointment will be filled with the next person in line and it's in the office's best interest, as well as the interest of the patients waiting behind you, to to inconvenience you or cancel your appointment rather than inconvenience the doctor and the 50 other people scheduled that day.\n\nThe second that it's impossible to tell how long each appointment will take. If a Dr's office scheduled an exact timeslot for each patient, there would be some patients who do not get their needs met in that time, and kicking out a patient who needs help because they went over their timeslot is generally unacceptable from an ethical standpoint. If they scheduled too much time, the doctor would have dead time with no patients. Since that Dr's time is extremely valuable, this is not an option, so they schedule slightly less time than the average patient needs, knowing that some will go over time and because of demand, they know you will wait the extra half hour, because there isn't a place with lower wait times someone else you can go if you find it unacceptable. If a patient takes less time, then the backlog is decreased, but the scheduling is always weighted to make optimal use of the Dr's time.\n\nThe 3rd is a self selecting triage. Because the of the demand for Drs there are always people wanting to see one, and always more patients than there is Dr time available. No Dr wants to turn away a patient, but at the same time, most offices don't want to waste resources on people who don't need them. As a result, people who's problems aren't serious enough to warrant waiting self triage out, and by this I mean, if you aren't willing to wait a potential 30 minutes to see the doctor, you probably didn't need to see one, and they didn't need your business.",

It\u2019s nice when I was pregnant... not so nice when I need a pap and she\u2019s running up my babysitter\u2019s tab by putting me an hour behind.\n(This was pre-covid \u2014 I hope it\u2019s not like that anymore, considering the waiting room was often packed as well)",
            "My ex wife used to work in a doctors office. The reason they run late is because they double or even triple book. They do not care if you wait. They mostly just want to make sure they don\u2019t have any free time.  They can\u2019t charge fir free time.",

            "It also depends on the Dr.  I once saw a hand specialist and I waited an hour or so extra (in an exam room, on top of waiting room wait) while she chatted with her assistant about her boyfriend's reluctance to go Europe with her to snow ski.  I was in plain view close enough that I could have joined the conversation from my chair.  But other Dr's I have seen are usually very busy, and when they run late it's because they are going way above and way beyond to help patients.",
            "Sometimes it\u2019s just greed. \n\nOne specialist I went to insisted on his staff allowing each patient just 15 minutes. He\u2019s an oncologist, surely that was not enough time for most patients. I was there for a (routine) colonoscopy. Patients would come at the appointed time and sign in and go to the gym, run errands or go home for dinner. I didn\u2019t have that luxury as I was coming straight from work on public transportation. The receptionist would call each of those patients when he was almost ready for their appointment. He was always two or three hours behind schedule by mid afternoon.\n\nAnother doctor was a minimum of two or three hours late and the receptionist would get annoyed if you questioned the delay. My last appointment with her was a 2.5 hour wait in the waiting room and then 45 minutes in the exam room. The staff made lame excuses for the delay and didn\u2019t appreciate me stepping out of the exam room (half dressed) to ask for an update. When she deemed to come into the exam room for the appointment it lasted less than three minutes.\n\nThen there was a very special dermatologist who had the largest waiting room ever (seating for about 30 people and LOTS of toys) \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9. I would make an appointment for 5:30AM (his earliest time) and there would be 10-12 patients already there when I arrived at 5:15. On the third appointment, after a two hour wait I told the staff I wasn\u2019t willing to wait any longer. They looked at me like I had three heads and never I returned.\n\nAnother doctor wasn\u2019t as bad, \u201conly\u201d 20 or so minutes late for the first appointment of the day because she had two young children. She told me they were the reason she was late (every single time). Get a nanny, get them up earlier or start your appointments later than 8:00AM.",
            "If we forget about the inconvenience and focus on efficiency, thinking of a doctor as a machine and patients as work to do, then the most efficient thing in order to complete the most work as possible is not to have the machine idle ever, meaning the doctor never waiting and having the pipeline of work full at all times (meaning patients will wait)",

            "Lack of alternatives. \n\nIt's because people will still give their business to a doctor even when they're 30+ minutes late.\n\nOnce a family doctor learns that there is some customer service involved in the receptionist position, they could make a killing! Not overscheduling people frees up more room, COVID safe(r), shows patients a respect for their time and makes them a lot happier when they see the doctor. Consistently being 30, 45 or even an hour+ late to EVERY SINGLE APPOINTMENT ruins a relationship/trust with patient. There just isn't any other alternatives right now though\n\nGranted I will admit that there are occasional emergencies in every medical office, but I have 1 doctor that use to be about an hour late to every single one of our 8/9a appointments. Every other field has to assess themselves and look for improvements. This is a great spot for the average doctors office to start",
            "Because a doctor will have blocks of time based on predictions of how long an appointment or procedure will take yet there are many variables that can cause delays that are out of their hands.

            "I am a surgical and appointment scheduler in an outpatient clinic that is located within a hospital. I work in a specialty office. There are several reasons for this. \n\n1.) Some offices cannot limit the amount of new patients they accept. Our office is a specialty office so we have to take patients as they are referred. We cannot turn patients away that need our medical services. Patients are not leaving our practice at the same rate that we are needing to see new patients/established patients for follow-up so there is often overflow. Sometimes we have a situation where we get 20-30 referrals for people that need to be seen within 1-3 weeks for a possible cancer diagnosis and those people often get double-booked.\n\n2.) Due to COVID-19 precautions many appointments are taking longer due to a need to sanitize/close rooms after each appointment. \n\n3.) Sometimes patients take much longer than an appointment is booked for. This can be because a patient needs consoling after a difficult diagnosis, they drop an unexpected bombshell on the provider or they get riled up. I've seen a patient hold an exam room hostage for over an hour because they threatened to harm the doctor and themselves. We needed to call in security and ensure the patient could leave safely. \n\n4.) Just like any position there are fast/slow/empathetic/ambivalent/hardworking/lazy doctors. One provider I work for routinely \"forgets\" they are scheduled to come in at 9am to see patients and roll in late. Another provider will always try to squeeze in \"just one more\" patient because they don't want anyone who is hurting to have to wait if they can help it. This provider will come in on days off/come in early/stay late to fit in their patients. \n\n4.) You would not believe the amount of people that \"No Show\" their appointments. Our office sends out reminder letters and automated reminder calls in the days/weeks leading up to an appointment and I've still seen days where only half of the scheduled patients show up to their appointment. Part of booking so closely is to try and minimize losses caused by patients being inconsiderate and ghosting. \n\n5.) Most of the scheduling decisions are determined by hospital policy/protocol. As a scheduler we are at the mercy of hospital administration. If the higher-ups decide clinics need to increase/cut appointment capacity we have to follow. Many healthcare decisions are made by people that do not have to interact with patients unfortunately. I wholeheartedly agree that the system is often set up to fail from the start.\n\nMy advice is to leave a solid cushion of room when booking an appointment. If the office tells me I'm booked for a 30 minute appointment I assume up to 60-90 minutes could be spent in that office. I know it is not ideal (time is money!) but we are in a situation where there are much too few doctors to handle the population.",

They are just Canadians. \"Black\" if we're using the word as physical descriptor like distinguishing someone amongst a group, or for a missing persons report. \n\nPeople here saying: \"America represents all of North and South America so African American makes sense.\" I find that a very flawed argument. \"America\" very rarely refers to all the countries in North & South America.

            "\"african american\" came about because the culture and history of the slaves was purposefully stolen from them. There are many descendants of slaves in america, and the history of slavery is an intrinsic part of the history of the nation.\n\nThat's why \"black pride\" is a thing, and \"white pride\" is a sketchy thing. Nobody gives a fuck if you're proud of being irish. There's plenty of \"italian pride\" people out there nobody gives a fuck about them either. \"Black pride\" exists because they don't know if their ancestors came from Somalia or Angola or anything in between, all they have left is their shared experiences and oppression, which a culture and a shared identity has formed around.\n\nThere are descendents of slaves in Canada, and racism also exists in canada, but for the most part *in my experience*, if it's relevant to the conversation people prefer just \"black\" as an adjective/descriptor over anything mealymouthed like \"african canadian\".\n\nSidenote anecdote: One of my friends I grew up with is from an african country. Still has an accent. We were out for beers one night and a girl we met referred to him as an african canadian and he was like \"uwotm8 i'm african, i'm also canadian but african canadian is weird just call me canadian, but you're obviously referring to me being black\" and you could see the gears jam in this girl's head in realtime",
            "No. We call them people/citizens/Canadians.",
            "Generally speaking no. \n\nSome might use that term to describe themselves, if they carry dual citizenship, but I have scarcely heard the term. The term Afro Canadian comes to mind. But usually the term is *Black* or *Canadian* or *Black Canadian*... or simply the title of whatever country they come from (Kenyan, Ethiopian etc...)\n\nThe term African American is specific to the US because of it\u2019s history with slavery. The phrase was likely coined by descendants of the slaves, part in a way to establish themselves as equals to their white counterparts. After all, after 400 years of having your identity, culture and heritage stolen from you, and suddenly being granted freedom, rights and citizenship it starts a process of inheriting / forming a new identity. One that might level the playing field, so to speak. This is a fact that a lot of people replying to you are apparently ignorant of.. \n\nhttps://yalealumnimagazine.com/articles/4216-the-origin-of-african-american\n\nI do want to clarify that I\u2019m not saying Canada didn\u2019t have slavery (we did). But our demographic history is different than that of the United States, most of our black population did not directly come to Canada as slaves. They may have come indirectly via slavery or by other forms of immigration... and in the 60\u2019s that started to become true of the United States as well. The black population was changing and coming from more diverse sources. However the term African American had already been somewhat cemented by that time. \n\nIt also speaks to the cultural differences of the US compared to other countries in regards to cultural assimilation. The US *has been* very much a \u201cmelting pot\u201d of cultural identity. (There are pros and cons to this).\n\nPersonally I think the term is changing. It will probably continue to evolve since more and more Black people seem to identity with the term Black. But it could change again. These labels tend to evolve all the time. They are quite fickle..\n\n\nEdit: there are black Canadians that refer to themselves as African Americans. It\u2019s not as common, especially now. But like I said, these terms are fickle and change often",

            "Most often called black or whatever country they are from. But if a similar term is used it's usually \"Afro Canadian\"",
            "When they're referred to as a distinct group, they're referred to as \"black Canadians\" but this term isn't used the same way Americans use \"African-American.\" It's used about as often (and in exactly the same contexts) as \"white Canadians\". It's not really used to refer to a distinct cultural group or identity the way it is in the US. \n\nWe use the term <nation>-Canadian typically to refer to people whose families have immigrated within the last few generations and where there is still a very strong cultural tie to their home country. Like, a Japanese-Canadian would self-identify as such in order to express a strong tie to their Japanese heritage. So any black Canadian who would identify that way probably doesn't identify as African-Canadian; rather, they more specifically identify as Nigerian-Canadian (for example) in order to express a specific cultural connection with their home country. Otherwise they're just \"Canadian\" regardless of skin colour.\n\nOne thing that's kind of important (and which a lot of people in the comments don't seem to recognize) is that Canada isn't really like this because we're magically less racist or because we're more/less PC. It actually has a lot more to do with the fact that black Canadian culture isn't as distinct and separate from the rest of Canadian culture as black American culture is.\n\nIn the US, there is a difference between the people typically referred to as \"African-American\" and a Nigerian-American. The Nigerian-American would have immigrated recently. The African-American is probably descended from slaves and doesn't know what country their ancestors came from (if they even care). They are not people who identify with the immigrant culture of another country. They identify specifically with *black American* culture, which grew up alongside but often completely distinct from white American culture. Black Canadian culture is a facet of Canadian culture as a whole. Black American culture is, in many ways, very much a wholly distinct thing from the rest of American culture. This is partly because of segregation and partly because there are just enough black people in the US to form their whole own culture without being completely swallowed up by the rest of American culture. So the term African-American is kind of weird because while it most often just gets used as a by-word for \"black person,\" it carries a bunch of additional cultural implications that are wholly unique to America. So... that's why it's not really a term that gets translated into other countries, because other countries don't have the cultural distinction that Americans do. \n\nBut I'll be interested to see how things progress now that the term \"African American\" is falling out of favour because I have a feeling that not all black Americans are going to embrace the generic term used to refer to every black person currently living in the US. I'm sure some are going to *want* to continue to self-identify with that unique black culture that has been growing among black Americans since well before slavery was abolished. So... what are they going to call themselves instead? I guess we'll see.",

            "As a married man, I would say it's similar to losing your temper and hitting someone.\n\nIs there a point at which humans can lose contol of their rational senses in moments of intense stimulation? Yes.\n\nBut we never totally lose control, and more importantly it was always our responsibility to not allow ourselves to get into that state of mind in the first place. We are still responsible for what we do in times where we lose ourselves in a moment of passion, because we could have prevented that from happening in the first place if we had managed ourselves better before we got overwhelmed.\n\nYour husband is making rather weak excuses for violating your consent. This is not a small mistake he has made. He gratified himself at your expense and disregarded your boundaries without any good reason whatsoever. It's like seeing someone hit someone else woth their car and expect to drive away without any consequences. Even if it was an honest mistake, you must still admit fault and submit to restitution. He was not entitled to treat you this way and I should hope it could be made clear to him that this grievance alone is ample justification for divorce. \n\nThis is one kind of rape. You consented to sex if and only if he pulls out, but he didn't. He violated your consent for no better reason than he didn't want to stick to the boundaries you placed.\n\nNow, how you respond to this is totally up to you. Perhaps you don't feel this rises to the level of divorce for you in your relationship. Only you can know what is and isn't acceptable in your relationship and what concessions you might need from him to ensure he will not violate your consent again.\n\nIt is not an exaggeration to say this could be a valid reason to end this relatonship. Don't fall into \"sunk cost fallacy\" (we just got married, the wedding was expensive, what will family think, etc). This is your life on the line if he does not begin respecting your boundaries. He needs to accept that what he did was egregiously wrong and commit to taking steps to change his behavior, plus compensate you somehow for the impact his reckless actions have already madevin your life now that you are pregnant. \n\nThis is not something you should let slide and assume it was a fluke. This tells me he lacks respect for you and you will likely see similar entitled and dismissive behavior towards you if you do not enforce your boundaries one way or another.",

I wasn't financially prepared, I still have intense financial problems 11 years in. \n\nMy son has mental health issues, I have mental health issues, my family has mental health issues, his dad has mental health issues. It's all terrible.\n\nMe and my son bicker, but it used to be a lot worse than it is now.\n\nI make ends meet, but barely.\n\nSo yea, it's really... really fucking difficult.

Even in the middle of the night, my alone time is at risk of being violated when he comes out to go to the bathroom, or worse, throw up at 2am all over the house.\n\nIt's... I mean, yea. It's hard.\n\nI gotta tell you though, for me at least, it really is worth it. Yea, it's hard. Yea, sometimes I really want to run away. But my son is honestly the coolest person. He's not a perfect person, but nobody is. He gets me though. He's sweet. He says kind things to me. We have great conversations.\n\nHe gives me hugs when I'm sad, he holds my hand when I put my hand out. If I ask him to do the dishes, or clean up after himself, mostly he won't complain about it. Even if he does complain, he still does it.\n\nWhen I need help with things that are too low or too hard, he's willing to get on his hands and knees and help me so I won't be in pain. Because he loves me. Just like I'm willing to do all this shit day in and day out, because I love him.\n\nSometimes we have the sweetest moments together. True bonding. I wouldn't trade that for the world.\n\nI love him more than I've ever loved anybody in my entire life, family included. It's the purest form of love. His laugh makes me genuinely happy.\n\nHe's the reason I'm still alive today.\n\nSo, yea, he costs a lot. You know. He's difficult. He argues.

Every day is an amazing adventure. Yes, it's exhausting, but you don't really notice in the moment because you're too distracted by your child's amazement at the world. To answer the question now, as a parent, I love having a child because it's mesmerizing seeing the world through a fresh set of eyes. Knowing you'll get to teach them and watch them grow. And if you had asked me before I had a kid why I wanted a kid, I'd have given you a similar answer, but had no real comprehension of what that really meant. The work isn't really work. The time is enjoyable. The money is better spent on them. The stress is only from the things that interfere with your time with them. And the exhaustion is worth it.",
            "There\u2019s debate in philosophy about whether having children is inherently selfish. I think the overwhelming consensus among virtually all people is that it isn\u2019t selfish, but there are intriguing counter examples. One of these is that the joy people feel from having children is blind to the fact that the children had no say in being born, and that any potential future suffering is a price they pay for the parents\u2019 desire to feel that joy earlier in their life.\n\nAgain, it is all essentially banter about existential autonomy, but interesting nonetheless.

            "So I explored porn with my wife, and as intimate as it was, there were a few awkward moments that almost made me regret it. We did it mainly to introduce each other to our kinks, since we\u2019re both into some sort of degeneracy \n\nThe first thing that was awkward was that it was not the sex acts I was into that bothered her. Not at all. What bothered her was that I sometimes focused on the woman. Example, my wife\u2019s a redhead, and I told her I was into redheads in my porn. She did not react well because she didn\u2019t realize some of the porn I watch has to do with the woman\u2019s appearance, and less about the actual sex act. For her, the people didn\u2019t really matter. It made her feel like she was competing with the women in porn for my attention.\n\nWhen we slowly started showing each other our kinkiest desires, it turned out we\u2019re not as sexually compatible as we thought we were. Turns out she was really into the intense pageantry of BDSM, and is - by anyones standard - into some of the most \u201chardcore\u201d kinks. When we started getting to those videos, I realized how much she missed that stuff, and that I wouldn\u2019t be able to meet her needs. When she got to my kinkier stuff, she didn\u2019t think she could meet my needs. \n\nIn the end, we tried, but couldn\u2019t satisfy each other\u2019s deepest desires. We ended up getting more involved in the BDSM community, where she can do all the fun stuff she wanted at their big parties, and she can introduce me to people who\u2019d love to play with me. We have very serious boundaries and are very open about communication, but this kind of relationship is def not for everyone.\n\nIn the end looking at each other\u2019s porn was difficult, but a net positive.",
            "Ohh bruh that doesn't end well. My boyfriend and I have shared porns and they're so far apart we doubted for a bit we were compatible. Especially since from what you describe in other comments the two of you haven't been together for very long, maybe a discussion about what each of you would like to try and some experimenting with that would be better. Save the porn for later.",
            "A lie would be the absolute worse thing you can do, but you can start off with something you actually like that's a little less kinky, and work your way up to the hard-core stuff.",
            "As someone who\u2019s been there with my husband, don\u2019t false flag. If she\u2019s casually asking you for links to SPECIFIC porn vids, she\u2019s at a comfort level with watching porn that only comes from watching a lot of porn. By just casually viewing Reddit, tumblr, and top vids on the PornHub page you come across a wide variety of porn, so it\u2019s more than likely she\u2019s seen the same types of videos you have at least once. It took a very long conversation and a lot of alcohol for my husband to drop that he watches those hokey \u201cbig bro no we shouldn\u2019t\u201d videos, but like, they\u2019re all over the front page so plenty of people do too, including myself. Turns out we actually watch a lot of the same stuff and want to try the same things, and that wouldn\u2019t have come up if we weren\u2019t honest with each other. We talked about what aspects turned us on and what we could do to bring that dynamic into the bedroom, like with the \u201cbig bro\u201d thing it\u2019s the forbidden attraction aspect so we can build off of that without bringing in the fake incest. \n\nIf it\u2019s a thing that turns you on and would like to try some aspect of it, send it to her and explain what it is you\u2019re looking for with it and see how you guys can make it happen together.",

            "Me and an ex went down this road. I was honest and showed her a few of my favorite scenes, which were the work of Mike Adriano (pretty extreme anal and ass licking stuff). She knew I was into butts, but nothing really prepared her for just how much. She just assumed it was the cheeks, not the hole. But she was willing to try, so she let me eat out her butt and have anal sex for the first time. Had the time of my life. It was the only time because she said the whole thing grossed her out. When we broke up weeks later she proceeded to tell everyone she knew what a butt pervert I was. Well one of her friends messaged me because she was into facesitting and analingus. So it all worked out in the end. 7 out of 10, would recommend.",
            "Holy fuck, those edits.",
            "I would want to know why she wants to know. \n\nIf she's genuinely looking to find out why kind of things your into with a view to trying things out then you potentially stand to gain from showing her the real thing (assuming you'd actually want to engage in them and don't just watch them as a fantasy). \n\nI'd also try and \"drip feed\" the videos. Don't open a load up in one hit because it lets you gauge the reaction. If she's okay with what she's seen then go to the next but if they're all open at once it might generate a bad reaction. \n\nAlso beware that this can be one of those things that can seem like a good idea, she might genuinely be on board but as you partially suggest in one of your comments, this does have the potential to backfire.",
            "Id say have her show you what she watches first. I had a couple ex's that did the same thing, but when I started out vanilla (I'm pretty vanilla anyways tbh) they immediately got insecure and angry with me and would bring it up in arguments.\n\nIm not saying its a trap, but im not saying its not one either. It sounds like shes actually trying to be cool based on the way she worded it, but depending on how long you have been together or how much you know about her, she very well could have false intentions, which isn't cool.\n\nEither way, trust is the way to go so if you can ease her into it, do it.",
            "What looks good in porn isn't always fun in person. Also what someone masturbates too isn't necessarily what they want in person either.\n\nWay better off just having a discussion about things and making a list of ideas you both want to try. Leave the porn out of it.",
            "Don't lie but if it's pretty kinky give her some warning and ask if she still wants to see it. And also be fair and ask to see her favorites too. And don't you dare be a hypocrite dick and judge her if it's something like Lesbians asian vampire zebra furry threesomes. :)",

That's fine, if a partner is asking something and it is making you anxious you should be free to decline. \n\nMaybe you can offer her to watch porn together, you can go as far as to what makes you comfortable with what you like to share. \n\nNo need to lie and it shows good communication to talk about your real feelings, you dont need to explain them per se. Just that you are not comfortable or ready to share your porn. Its the truth and that should be fine.",
            "Don\u2019t lie! Show her what you truthfully watch. Because if she finds out you lied then she will definitely think it\u2019s her body type you were trying to hide it from her. Most women aren\u2019t so naive as to think their partner looks for pornstars that could be their twin. Females watch porn too, and most the men I\u2019m sure don\u2019t have your body type.",
            "Watch it together and explain the parts you like. For example, \"I like how she makes eye contact\" or \"I think this position is hot and I want to try it\" It's easy to misinterpret porn because what people find sexy is subjective... Plus, it's more fun to do it together!",

That way nobody is outed as being into pee play when the other is not.  No feelings are hurt.",
            "Hey OP, so there is actually a website where you and your partner both independently take a test of kinks or things you would like to try sexually and shows you both only the ones that you both had in common. \n\nThis might be a bit better for you both to explore each other's interests.",
            "Be honest. Lying now will potentially become a deal-breaker in your relationship in the future. The worst that can happen is that she finds it weird.\n\nHonestly, though, drop pornography; it messes with your brain reward system.",

            "Remember that not everything you like in porn is going to be something you're into during sex. You might enjoy watching degrading porn, but actually degrading someone you know and have to eat breakfast with tomorrow morning is a different kind of thing. Beware that it may not be as \"hot\" when you're involved. She also may not react the way you expect and it could be a complete disaster. \n\nWhat I would recommend instead is to do a sexual compatibility/fetish test where she and you both rate how you feel about certain kinks by yourselves, and then the test will show you what you're both at least sort of into. It saves the embarrassing kinks having to be revealed unless you're both at least a little into it. \n\nGood luck and pick a safe word.\n\nEdit: just because this is getting some votes, the test I mention can be easily googled. Some are more in depth and explicit. The really heavy and thorough ones I've seen are available via PDF, my guess is so they are hand written and signed and more legit (your legal protection is important here on both ends, if you're feeling brave embed them in the Blockchain privately with simple password encryption). \n\nAnother note I'll make in this edit is that you're opening Pandora's box here. Be careful, be positive, cover your ass, be forgiving, etc. Here's some things to think about that hurt me in the end:\n\nWhat happens if you discover something you love and can't come back from, you need it and crave it and she hates that thing? What if she discovers she loves multiple penetration and being in a devils 3 way is something she def wants to try at some point? What if you hear the word \"abuse\" at some point afterwards during a fight and become concerned? Be careful. Again, pick a safe word.",

They\u2019re the last person in the world you should have to put on a front for. If you feel like you can\u2019t be yourself with the person you love, that\u2019s a red flag. \n\nYou can talk about this in respectful and tactful way, too, though. Be empathetic that she may feel insecure and hurt afterward. Don\u2019t rub it in that she asked for this. Be kind and compassionate and accept her feelings as valid (they are). However, if she doesn\u2019t / won\u2019t do the same for you, that\u2019s another red flag. \n\nYou\u2019re both entitled to your own feelings and opinions, and you may not always agree on everything.

The brain is the most important sex organ there is, and who is to say what weird, freaky stuff will make our brains light up in excitement? \n\nI think I saw someone say something to the effect of \u2018watching degrading porn is one thing, having degrading sex with someone you eat breakfast with every morning is different.\u2019 There are plenty of things everyone wishes they could do but don\u2019t because of whatever repercussions there may be.

            "This post is 21 hours old by the time I saw it, but I have experience of this; two partners have wanted to know *everything*... And it seems like a wonderful thing, right? No secrets, they even seem to want to please you entirely...?\n\nIt's not really though; it's more a sign of immaturity in hindsight. It's natural and normal to have your own boundaries. If you're really not going to be uncomfortable with *anything*, it shows you don't have a solid sense of who you are. Reveailing you're into some unusual or even shocking kink and they don't have an opinion on it *outside of yours* means they aren't really following their own heart.  \n\nA real relationship is based on at least 2 people finding mutual, genuine joy and building upon that together. And accepting that sometimes masturbation is just a casual thing you do, not something that shows a deep need that the partner has to fulfil every waking moment; down that route lies insecurity, because you can never, ever be everything someone might once have been aroused by. Even dyed hair, weight or body change can't make the clock go backwards to the past...\n\nOne partner who wanted to see \"all the porn\" was beautiful, amazing, and tried a tonne of the stuff I showed her... funnily enough it's her birthday today, mustn't try and get back in touch because although I was besotted, she didn't understand boundaries, and tried to make *my friends dreams come true* as well. And cheated constantly because she thought she was making lots of people happy. Last time I spoke to her, she said she was cheating because \"subconciously I guess I wasn't happy\".  Ouch. As I say, immaturity. She genuinely didn't seem to understand that if you say yes to everything, you're saying no to nothing and thus don't really *mean* anything.\n\nThe second who wanted to see it all was bi-polar or similar and had intense rage attacks; wanting to know everything was her way of making up for her own lack of control, buying your affection back when she'd recently flown off the handle at me.  Again, she didn't have an opinion on the actual kinks, except as a tool to try and purchase what she really wanted, was devotion to her even at her worst. The idea of tackling her own violent mood swings was never considered...\n\nFar better to just say to your partner; \"We'll discuss all kinks in good time, and see what we want to try together. Some you won't, some I won't, but what matters most is I love you above all people and we'll take the roads that make us happiest together. That's my biggest turn on, being with the real you and finding real happiness.\"\n\nBecause what also leads to disaster is saying \"I really, *really* get off to pee in gape\" and your partner thinking \"I would be humiliated and think less of you for that\" or \"If I don't allow you to do something I find disgusting, I'll never please you as much as porn does\".  A partner is an emotional bond, not an orgasm dispensor; but once the fear they're inferior sets in, it's very, very hard to shift it again. So don't take the risk. Downplay your fetishes. You're not lying; you're building a much stronger base for what *really* makes being with someone special.",

I assume it's a loving and close and warm relationship, which obviously is a good sign. My gf and I were pretty much best friends for a while before dating, so by the time we were dating and talking about porn, we were comfortable about it and it wasn't weird. A critical part of it though is 1. My gf went in already pretty much ready for whatever kink I revealed 2. She likes a LOT of different things, some of which I'm not even into and 3. We discussed in depth before. We discussed as in \"so you're not gonna get mad at me really you promise?\" And \"ok don't judge me for anything even if you don't like it, don't give me shit cuz I'll feel embarassed\" and stuff like that to ensure there was lots of communication and that she knew what she was getting herself into. I also eased her into it. I told her what I watched, then later mentioned the kinkier things, then when she wanted to see, I eased her in, starting with a few videos I felt she probably expected, then later showing some of the kinkier videos. I didn't go straight in being like, \"so here's a video of a girl getting fucked half to death, here's the hardest of all the core, here's the weirdest video I've ever felt arousal from.\" \n\nI had a very lucky circumstance for many reasons, one being that we have a lot of very similar kinks, and another being that my favorite things involve a woman being pleasured, which obviously is appealing to a woman who wants to be pleasured. \n\nIt's not dishonest to show her some stuff only or not show her the super crazy stuff you like. It's whatever you're comfortable with and what you think would go best",

If she knows FIRST that you like, for example, to see two girls together, and she searches and selects a video based on what she sees of the women, then she knows it is the woman to woman and not body size. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have done this with a GF and with my wife. We sat together and I would have them search the things and they would pick the videos, and we would openly talk about what we liked and didnt like about what we saw. \n\nYou are lucky to have someone willing and open to talk.",

You could talk about the settings, roles, clothing, enthusiasm, etc.",
            "Yup, this can backfire hugely.  If you have some kinks and she's shocked, or turned off, better to find it out early.  Those kinks - if they're important to your satisfaction - need to be something shared and enjoyed, not just tolerated, or accepted \"because they love you\".

The large majority of users don\u2019t care for those posts and don\u2019t want to see them. They are considered taboo and controversial even.
