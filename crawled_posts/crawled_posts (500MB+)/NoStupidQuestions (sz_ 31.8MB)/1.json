            "Hmm, I wonder who spent more developing the product they are reselling?\n\nMany of the large pharmaceutical companies spend 20% or more of their revenues on R&D. The smaller ones can spend up to 50% on R&D. Compare that to the overall average for industries of 1.3%. Pharmaceutical companies spent $71.4 billion in R&D in 2017.  Also, drug patents have a maximum of 20 years. After that, anyone can make the drug. Don't forget, the Companies pay the same to develop a drug that doesn't work or has unacceptable side affects as one that goes on sale.\n\nCompare that to some guys clearing out every store in their area of sanitizer and selling it online for profit during a crisis.\n\nI'm not saying pharmaceutical drugs aren't overpriced, but it is hardly an apples-to-apples comparison.",

            "I think the main reason drugs are marked up so much is because the actual manufacturing of drugs is not the pricy part. The research is expensive. They have to mark up prices just to break even from the research. The real problem is when companies never take their prices down once they have already made the money back that they used to research the drug.\n\nSo on the one hand, if you want smart people to be developing drugs, their has to be a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Why else would they waist years of research and millions of dollars to develop these drugs? On the other hand, you have to make these drugs as cheap as possible to save as many lives as you can. It's such a tough balance. That's why we haven't figured it out yet.",

            "Edit 1: Source, I\u2019m a professional economist\n\nThere\u2019s two answers to your questions. \n\nThe first is that \u201cprice gouging\u201d is more of a subjective term than an objective term. People will throw around the term price gouging when they feel that someone is charging an unreasonable price. Objectively, the \u201ccorrect price\u201d is any price in a range of prices. The lowest possible price is the lowest price what a seller is willing to sell for, and the highest price is the maximum willingness to pay by the consumer. Arguably and controversially, prices for hand sanitizer should be higher because aggregate willingness to pay for hand sanitizer has increased. This is strictly the economics of the situation. Obviously, economics does not capture everything that is going on and ethics can help us fill the gaps. That ethical consideration, \u201ceven if economics says the price should be $X, morals tell us it should be lower\u201d is why people call it \u201cprice gouging.\u201d And, clearly, pharmaceuticals are held to a different standard. But, there seems to be no objective moral facts, so what the ethical thing to do in the two situations could be different and depend on context, social pressures, expectations, current standards, etc. \n\nThe second answer is that there is a very good reason why pharmaceutical companies charge huge markups in many drugs. Basically, these companies spend millions, sometimes billions, of dollars and many years on research and development us new drugs. Once they have spent this huge fixed cost, they can often manufacture the drug for quite cheap. However, they need to recoup the costs of R&D. Imagine if you spent that much time and money on something and weren\u2019t compensated for it (see r/choosingbeggars for how, correctly, upset people get when they don\u2019t get paid $20 for their work). So, typically drug companies are given patents where they basically have a monopoly over that drug for a few decades. The idea is that they can recoup their costs and make a fair profit. Once the patent expires, the drug can be made by anyone and prices tend to fall quite rapidly. If we didn\u2019t allow companies to sell at such a high markup for a short time, a lot less drugs would be developed. Now we could argue that pharmaceutical companies out to discover drugs out of the goodness of their hearts. But be honest with yourself, do you really think that would work? Of course not. \n\nIn short, there is a disconnect between how we think people ought to act and how they actually do. Moreover, there\u2019s different ethical standards people hold given societal pressures, social norms, and context of the situation. Lastly, we know there plate good reasons for pharmaceutical pricing, which is why few people get as upset. \n\nTLDR - price gouging is subjective. Drug researchers and companies gotta get paid for their work. Ethics is hard",
            "They're both price gouging.",
            "Price gouging is defined as taking advantage of an emergency to make an unfair profit.

We have different units which work on different parts of the cancer therapy research. Some small victories can take up to week and months of work of scientists prior. The reagents and other stuff, to prove theories on real examples are expensive, too. Sometimes there are patents of other pharmaceutical research companies, you have to pay for using their stuff to accomplish your goals.

            "I think it's even more important to understand the price gouging\u00a0**is**\u00a0reasonable pricing during an emergency. It's very common to read about this problem in the context of hurricanes in econ classes, but a surprisingly huge chunk of Americans (and politicians) aren't aware of it, so they implement policies that badly backfire.\n\nPricing an item according to its real value (also known as price gouging in times of high demand) prevents hoarding and eliminates shortages. Under demand-based pricing, there will literally always be enough supplies for those that need it most (typically governments in cases in cases like masks, but also the public in cases like toilet paper). Higher prices also solve scarcity faster: producers and distributors are greatly incentivized to produce and distribute more, and more quickly. The only downside of demand-based pricing is that the poorest are (very temporarily) priced out, but in the case of artificially low prices, they're priced out anyway due to a combination of hoarders (who overzealously protect themselves) and scalpers (who understand the actual value of the item). Hoarding and scalping are inevitable problems when you hold prices artificially low (which is also why ticket sales are scalped, btw). Economics, like physics, has natural laws you can't fight against.\n\nFor more information:\u00a0[https://www.wsj.com/articles/price-gouging-after-a-disaster-is-good-for-the-public-1507071457](https://www.wsj.com/articles/price-gouging-after-a-disaster-is-good-for-the-public-1507071457)",

            "Cause price gouging means you have to sell it by a supremely high amount, normally during a shortage, and above the normal supplier. \n\nIf the company is the only supplier, it is just high prices.  They can pick and choose their price, wether production cost or 10000% higher. It\u2019s just market at that point.",
            "I in no way condone the massive prices of life saving drugs. It should be illegal. However, Devil's Advocate for a second:\n\nSay you own a pharmaceutical company. You've spent the last... 15 years developing a drug that say... cures cancer. You built the company from the ground up. Research, Development, Testing, Manufacturing, you/your company paid for every nickel of it, massive amounts of debt. Now suddenly, you have a drug that can save (hundreds of?) thousands of lives. You sell each dose for say... $300. The public massively hates you. Claims you are corrupt and evil, that you should give the drug away for nearly free. They argue \"it only costs 10 cents to make it, you don't need to charge $300 for a 10\u00a2 pill that I need daily/weekly/whatever.\"\n\nSure. The second pill you produced was 10\u00a2. But the first one? It cost you $26,000,000,000 (26 billion) and 15 years.\n\n\nI think it is price gouging. But at least in **some** cases, they have something of a point (fr though, they could make it a little less obvious just how much they are gouging us)",
            "Because pharmaceutical companies have paid Congress to make it so.",
            "Because when you are a corporation worth millions and billions of collars you get to write your own laws.",
            "People < corporations",
            "Because of lobbying.",
            "I'm sure this has already been said, but CAPITALISM. This makes it all well and good to fuck each over for a profit. It's the AMERICAN way.",
            "I don't think it's okay.  But to play devil's advocate, pharmaceutical research is extremely expensive, and often hit-or-miss as to whether it will yield results.  That's the reason the pharma companies claim they charge so much.  \n\nOf course once they start reporting record profits to their shareholders, and many of their shareholders are in congress, these things should be looked at with a closer eye.",
            "I was really hoping that the top comment would be that the price of something is what it is and that its considered gouging when the demand (and price) for something skyrockets under atypical circumstances. Instead the top comments are is just a sea of mindless liberal bellyaching being rewarded for not understanding the question",
            "I think this is why states like Ohio don't have price gouging laws, or else the big pharma wouldn't rake in profits.",
            "You must live in a state with price gouging laws, because you dont understand the concept. It isn't that people are buying out stores and reselling, that's  not price gouging. Price gouging is when target and Walmart start charging $17 for a 9 roll pack of charmin becuase of supply and demand when normally that 9 pack would cost $10. Or when my coworker had to go buy diapers the other day, he said normally they are $45, this time they were $80. And that price gouging is being done by RETAILERS. \n\nThat's price gouging and why it's not ok and a big deal. There are a lot of people who cant afford paying double for diapers, a basic necessity.",
            "The answer is: no one knows....\n\nI am a pharmacist. Your specific question does have a bit if an answer. Drug companies spend billions of dollars developing crazy new therapies for life changing and saving conditions. They expect to be rewarded. If there is no incentive, therapies for certain forms of cancer, and other rare diseases sinply would not exist.\n\nNow why can pharmacies mark things up almost 1000%???  I have no idea!!! It makes my life a living hell! We bought a bottle of 100 aspirin for $1.36 and when I ran a prescription for 30 tablets through our computer it came back at $11.99! WHAT THE F??!? If someone doesn\u2019t have insurance, they basically start crying in the lobby and its super frustrating bc I KNOW these drugs cost no where near the cash price.\n\nThey mark it up super high so they can bill insurances super high. They have to apply that price to everyone or else insurance companies will not allow the pharmacy to bill them.\n\nDiscount cards like good rx work bc they provide a loophole to allow a lower price. So they will charge the pharmacy like $3 to \u201cbill the discount card\u201d and the discount card will give the customer a more reasonable (but still bad imo) \u201ccopay\u201d. Its just a loophole so pharmacies can give people more reasonable prices without insurance.\n\nIn my 2 years, I have never let someone pay the actual cash price. Always a discount card or insurance.\n\nSmaller pharmacies can get away with charging one price to a cash paying cutomer and another price to insurances a little bit. Bigger stores won\u2019t take that risk.",
            "Both are wrong.",
            "I\u2019m a firm believer in the capitalistic venture of buying and reselling any product for any level of attempted profit by an individual, because they\u2019re not doing it to satiate a board of shareholders, or escalate revenue in pursuit of a profit margin, they\u2019re doing so cause they\u2019re in the same boat we\u2019re in. \n\nYou know how i\u2019ve been saving up for college? I go to my local goodwill. Any paperback book in the store is $1.18 a piece. I buy ones that look like attractive eBay pieces and I generally get between $18 and $25 a piece for them. My average markup is 1800%, and my average profit margin is between 1200% and 1300%. if i slashed my prices to land between $9 and $12, i could move these books within the hour they\u2019re posted and still land a 900% markup and easily 500% profit margin. Am i defrauding my buyer or my local goodwill at this price? No. They choose to charge that price. I choose to buy at that price. I choose to charge my price. My buyer chose to pay that price. Every step has consent from both parties, that they\u2019re getting a fair transaction.\n\nNow when we hit pharmaceuticals is where things get really grey, unethical, and even a sly bastard such as my self can call it detestable, because these companies have realized their customer base is often incapable of not buying their product, sometimes to the point that their life depends upon it, and have moved their profit margins into the 30,000%, 60,000%, and some cases even 100,000% profit area. This is true price gouging. You can say what you want about how consent works but in my eyes in this case, it is removed from the buying party seeing as how they could die without purchasing this product.\n\nTl;Dr: True person-to-person transaction price gouging doesnt really exist except in extremely rare cases, because the nature of a purchase is consentual between the buyer and seller, no matter that price. Pharma companies are however some troglodyte sons of bitches."

            "1. Official news outlets have a incentive to report verified news over rumor and heresay that can't be independently verified.  Not saying these cases didn't happen, just that the news outlets might be having trouble getting official verification. A respectable news outlet tries to have official sources, preferably first hand, that it can quote.\n2. The riots are a more important thing right now. People need to know if the unrest is going to break out in open warfare between cops and protestors in their area or if the enforcers are going to do things like shoot them with paintballs for being on their porch. \n3. It is old news, as some have pointed out. These things were brought up when he ran in 2016, and it was not enough to sway his base. Most people who oppose him are already aware of the allegations. \n3.\n\nEdit: poop. Sorry about the extra number.

            "Before Trump was elected, these sorts of documents about Trump (including the full witness statement of a 13 year old girl allegedly raped by Trump) were extensively shared and discussed on r/politics in 2015.  \n\nBasically republicans tended not to believe the documents, while Democrats did.   The Democrats heavily downvoted comments that disbelieved the allegations or that supported Trump.    Republicans heavily downvoted comments that attacked Trump.\n\nThe republican downvoters were outnumbered by the democrat downvoters.   Sick of constantly being downvoted below 0, the Trump supporters/republicans left r/politics.   \n\nDespite being progressive myself, I regard the one sided echo chamber that was left in r/politics as dangerous and toxic.   \n\nFor one thing, no one left in r/politics saw the Trump win coming, despite the Trump win showing up in the polls if you actually took into account the stated margin of error.  \n\nFor another thing, the echo chamber has left hundreds of thousands of people unable to de-escalate political arguments  long enough to have a civil conversation long enough to *understand* why people are on the other side.\n\nWithout understanding, nothing can move in a better direction.",
            "Oh, yeah, I remember this case from the last presidential election. Unfortunately, the waters were kind of muddied by some tabloid publisher/TV producer who'd had a feud with Trump at some point in the '90s. From what I remember, he apparently made statements on behalf of the victim without consulting her or her attorney, so any credibility that the plaintiff may've had was damaged by this asshole's meddling.",

People will just believe what they want to believe, and accept whichever \"leaks\" confirm their preconceived notions.",

            "When I got into the sixth grade, I discovered that after the fifth grade, there is no recess. Nobody prepared me for that. I basically stopped doing homework and just played when I got home from school. Rather than just making up that hour or so, I didn't feel like my need for play was satisfied unless I basically did no homework. I was lucky to have graduated high school.  \n  \nWhen I got my first job (in highschool), I discovered that I would not have summer breaks... no more being out camping for a week at a time. No more sleeping in late most days. I began laying around in bed whenever I had free time. During the school year, this meant I would go to bed when I got home.  \n  \nWhen I started working as an adult, I discovered that there would be many weekends when I would work, or my friends would work, so our days off would not match up. I feel lonely as an adult, and get drunk on my weekends. I have a wife, now, so it isn't so bad as binge drinking alone...  \n  \nBut now that I'm married, I get no alone time, and I often have housework to do on my time off from school (I'm a full-time student). I put off my housework and homework when I am alone so that I can have the break I need... but the breaks I take are too long or too often, and I'm struggling to get my work done.  \n  \nI stay up too late to make up for lost time, and take too long of naps to make up for lost sleep. I play too much minecraft because I have to satisfy my desire to play before my wife gets home...  \n  \nI do it, but I don't think it's healthy. I think it's a symptom of an unbalanced lifestyle.",
            "Yes, after work its pick up the house while wife cooks, eat, clean kitchen, get kids ready for bed, put them to bed... Its then 8:00 and haven't sat down all day. I stay up late otherwise it feels like a rinse and repeat day in and day out.",
            "My week is just waking up at 6am, work at 7, home around 4pm. Then I go to sleep at 7-8pm because I'm tired. I might not sleep, but I still just lay there.\n\nI don't do much more during work days than work and sleep.\n\nI'm 26 year old welder. I can't even be bothered to have hobbies because my days are dedicated to resting so I can work.",
            "I used to do this, but honestly I found myself having more quality time by waking up early. Staying up late just steals time from tomorrow, and I'd either oversleep or wake up feeling crappy and sluggish, and that often would lead to a cycle of crappy days, and trying to stay up late, playing games, drinking or doing drugs, trying to \"make up\" for the crappy day I had. The only way I broke that cycle was to go to bed early, wake up early, and make the most of the time before going in to work or school.\n\nI thought I was a night owl, but mostly it was that I was always waking up tired from staying up wasting time all night. When I finally turned my life around and started making good choices, I quickly realized one of the best things I could do, and the best way to do the things I *truly* wanted to do (less time spent on sites like Reddit and more time spent working on writing novels) was to make myself go to bed on time and wake up ready to do the work I wanted to do.",

Well, that means I need to sleep around 10PM. That leaves me with 2 hours of free time, when am I going to cook, relax, have fun? Weekends?\n\nOh wait, not even weekends. Because the chores that I cannot do with the limited time I have in the weekdays, I have to do at the weekends. Working from weekday to weekday, only to have a downtime at the weekend so that I can get ready for work again... Seriously, even the weekends are not enough.

            "Me too lad, I think it's mainly because most websites now are aggregators, meaning they don't exclusively create their own content in their own website, letting people create their content on their website. As the website get bigger, people who want to get big on the internet posts on the bigger website, not posting on their own website, leading to what we have today.",
            "It's not the internet that has gotten small, but people's browsing patterns. Back in the early days of the internet, people had a preferred search engine. Some used Lycos, others liked AskJeeves or Dogpile. I still remember when someone told me about google and thinking that sounded like a name a baby came up with. Your search engine of choice was a way of saying something about yourself and how you used [The Net](https://c8.alamy.com/comp/BKDTJC/the-net-1995-poster-BKDTJC.jpg), as we sometimes called it. \n\nThe point is, everyone used the internet differently. There were lots of ways to choose and curate your experience. \n\nToday, the internet is vastly bigger than it was then, with exponentially more content, and what content there is is exponentially more sophisticated and interactive. But our gateways into it are narrower, though fewer, massively popular channels. These channels are also more defined by our peer-group (digital or physical) than they used to be. \n\nYou never learn about fringe content if you only ever check social media sites like Reddit, Twitter, Snapchat, etc, because those people all tend to talk about the same things, as well as seek out content from similar places as you do. The result is a digital experience that feels very insular and contained.\n\nThe content is there. People just aren't actively seeking it out as often or in the same ways as they used to.",

I really enjoyed it because I traveled a lot as a kid. I remember when all of a sudden people referred to some malls as Simon Malls. The company Simon had started buying up malls in the United States. Within for five or six years, all of the malls in the United States were pretty much the same. Most of the same anchor stores with the same filler stores. The Styles really weren't different and everything just kind of Blended in. That was the end of malls. They never came back. This post reminds me of this",
            "I do but at the same time there are some gems out there that no one wants to give the light of day.\n\nSocial media site ello as an example. It's been taken over by artists primarily but their mission statement is great. Non profit social media and your data is protected.\n\nThere are plenty of examples out there of sites and things like that. But we have gotten to a point where if we don't see people who know or the likes we don't go there. We all contributed to the internet's centralization and none of us do much to change it. Including me.",
            "There is more out there than it seems, but you definitely don't have to go off the beaten path if you don't want to.\n\nThe new institutional Internet is not all bad. I can review and compare the health recommendations for brushing your teeth on the websites for 12 different nations' college of dentists. I can go to a website whose sole purpose is to aggregate viewer reviews of television shows. Nearly ever newspaper around the world can be read online on their own website, sometimes for a fee. There are still tens of thousands of incredibly useful websites, although most of them are run by relatively large players even if we are talking about a university website and not some dude named Maddox's blog.\n\nThe main thing that the new internet changed is commercialization. Whether you're one dude with a blog or a company with an ordering catalogue, a major purpose for your website is to probably to gain money. That doesn't apply to literally every site, but it's a lot of them. Facebook allows you to set up easy virtual storefronts if you suck with technology. And so most of the people who are in it for the money attach to one of the major platforms (YouTube, FB, Amazon) that are also in it for the money. They're the ones who pay to advertise, and it does feel like a closed system where you spend time on the main platforms and most of what you see is encouraging you to spend more tie or money on the major platforms. But if you're willing to go off the tracks, there's still so much cool stuff out there. You just won't see it advertised. The word-of-mouth internet has been replaced by the commercial internet.\n\n.... On that last point, it blows my mind that we have created technology to allow anyone anywhere to access anything, copy knowledge, share science and ideas, and the main progress on the internet is how well we have been able to shut that down and make you pay for everything as if you were getting a physical copy of it in your home. Our intellectual property law is heavily influenced by industry lobbies and it's centuries out of date imo. Like if road speed limits were still based on the safe travel speed of the Model T.",
            "I have to disagree. I would say some has been consolidated but the internet is bigger than ever. I think its you that sticks to 7 websites. \n\nI'll say it again. The internet is bigger than ever with 1.74billion websites online. Sure 99% is trash and scams. That leaves more than 7 websites. Go on google, search a thing, ignore the reddit, pintrest, Instagram links and open up a website. Its that easy. Feel free to down vote because you disagree its that easy.",

Thats not necessarily a dig a reddit, so plz dont get me wrong.\n\nAfter getting hit with a ban for awhile during covid (I STILL dont know what I did, but I think I got bad advice in making new accounts, got VERY bitter afterward and hasnt changed yet) I realized there are no forums left (some), and you come to reddit for chat in almost every circumstance.\n\nSo when you get banned on reddit in one sub, regardless whether it was in error or not, you are banned from EVERYTHING. THIS, coupled with the fact that sites are disappearing and you have no place to go *is a bad combination. Now add in the fact that you might refuse Facebook.

It did even before an injury that seriously eroded my linguistics in particular.\n\nFor me, it's like when your eyes lose focus, and you just let it happen.  There's some very automatic small tasks we perform, like when you've honed finding your grip on a baseball bat to just letting it slide with your hand closing to follow it as it narrows.  You eventually hit the pommel, and lock your grip.  It's a lot of words, but it would be pretty easy to code 'close hand with light grip until object widens, then grip firm.' \n\nThe syntax for your nervous system works differently than explaining it verbally, but it's very concise, without need for a lot of variables.  Our brains are often very good with context, so we can automatically initiate the simplest parts of a complex behavior, and that can fire off enough synapses in a related chain that we end up doing the whole job the one task is related to, without thinking.  Or, we pantomime it so closely, that the only difference is the absence of our conscious participation.\n\nI think of reading without taking anything in as that; my brain knew to view letters in sequence, left to right, while either mumbling the words to myself out loud or thinking the sounds in my internal voice.

It\u2019s just me and it I wake up at 7ish I can screw around and do what I want for a few hours. It also gives me a good start on the day and makes it easier to transition to my normal week sleep cycle. It\u2019s also healthier and you can do whatever shopping you need to before stores get busy.\n\nWaking up super early is hard at first but if you do it a few times it\u2019s awesome.

She's bored during the day, nobody to talk to, and I work from home, so I'm always here.  She was interrupting my work so much during the day to come over and talk about nothing but trivial shit.   I got nothing done, losing money, losing my temper but couldnt say anything and risk my housing.\n\nI had to switch to working night shift and sleeping days to get her to leave me the fuck alone.  I'm moving out,  on the waiting list for a really good place, hoping in the next month.",

            "Yes. I've had my own place for the majority of my adult life. Ever since my gf moved in with me four and a half years ago, I get very little time to myself. So, I tend to stay up at least two to three hours later than she does most nights.",

After all it is \"my\" life right? I can picture your situation though and totally understand why you stay up late to be alone. Enjoy your me time buddy. Peace out! \ud83d\ude0e\u270c\u262e",

            "Most definitely yes. Also a big part of why I keep the job I currently have; nobody really asks about my life outside of work and I can lie about any of it with basically zero repercussions. I don't have to be \"just someone's mom\" there or be responsible for others when everybody at home is already asleep \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
            "No joke, I was literally thinking about how much I do this less than 12 hours ago and then this popped up in my notifications. The thought of this being the case--that I stay up late because not only do I like the feeling of being surrounded by a dark outside world and turning on all of the neon colored lights in my room, but also because I like operating in a space where I know no other people will bother me because they're all asleep (or maybe worse, doing the very same thing I'm doing) is incredibly calming and emotionally reassuring--all made me incredibly self-aware in a sad and uncomfortable way. I hate that I start feeling anxious and displaced when around other people, and I want to get back out into the world and start experiencing life again. Part of the problem is that I'm so damned *drained* all the time--maybe it's depression, maybe I'm just lazy, who the fuck knows--but it's all so overwhelming on a mental/sensational level, and I don't really know how to get myself out of it. I always end up sleeping until 11:30-2:00, I feel like my day-to-day life is being wasted, and I just generally feel like I'm operating in a haze. I don't know if everybody else's feelings run this deep, but seeing this at a time when literally any other question in the universe could have been asked just felt like a sign that I need to confront something... So, uh, yeah, I do this a lot.\n\nThanks for coming to my TED Talk, y'all.",
            "Of course! Plus, it\u2019s oddly comforting being in the dark. You know that about half the world is sleeping at that time, and you won\u2019t have to worry about being around others lol",
            "I do a lot of stuff at night because everyone else are asleep and I don't want to get caught doing it..",
            "I think I just realized I should probably just move to Alaska where it stays dark for days and days!",

            "Yes 100000%.\n\nThe night time is when nothing is expected of me. I don\u2019t have to communicate, there\u2019s no work, nothing. I get to just relax. I usually light a candle or two, listen to music and just relax. Sometimes I clean because I find it enjoyable at night? Probably because it\u2019s not a chore at that point and I\u2019m doing it because I want to. \n\nI know that once I go to sleep, my day restarts and I\u2019m back at work, cooking, cleaning, managing my finances, and taking care of whatever else is needed. But once it\u2019s night time I\u2019m alone and can do whatever I want. So so relaxing",

When the baby is finally truly asleep for a few hours in the middle of the night when my husband and pets are cozy in bed, I like to be all alone in the quiet and play Sims 4 lol. I am constantly being cuddled, nursed from, hugged, kissed, bumped, etc. the last thing I want to do after I finally detach the baby from my boob is interact or snuggle up in a bed full of animals and my husband. I just want space and not to be needed or touched.",
            "That's really the only time I can decompress and have my quite time",
            "yes. to the point it's detrimental to my health. Single dad here, all my days are dedicated to either my job or being on standby for my kid, so the evening hours are the only hours I get to spend on myself so sometimes I push the hours to just get around 5-6hours of sleep bc at 7AM the kid wakes up and the daily routine resets itself.",
            "No I stay up at night because I work overnights(rip)",
            "1000% yes",
            "Sadly yes. My life is a depressing one and at night when I\u2019m alone is the only time I can convince myself to keep going in. I can stare at the wall for hours and there is no punishment, no risk, but also no reward. I only had my gm ride with me on deliveries because he could tell something was off. If it wasn\u2019t riding with me I would have veiled off in traffic to hopefully end it all",

I'm stuck on the fact that he asked a 17 year old for their number anyway. What if she wouldn't have declined? He also went to her Facebook and saved pictures of her to his phone to send to us. I also found out that a girl that he previously talked to for a few years was freshly 18 and idk bruh this all grosses me out and I don't want to be his friend anymore.

I cant imagine any 35yo being able to relate and date a 17-18 year old unless they just wanted to have sex with young women Or because there was something so fundamentally wrong with them that women their age wanted nothing to do with them.\n\nCreepshow\n\nThey are basically kids, emotionally and otherwise.  It doesn\u2019t feel that way when you ARE 18 and you feel super adult and mature\u2026until you turn 35-40 and realize how wrong you were.",

            "People who only date 18 year olds are like companies that only pay minimum wage. \n\nThey\u2019d be going lower if it were legal. Creepy and predatory af. I think it would even classify as grooming since he\u2019s approached her as a minor and made advances.\n\nHe either wants to date a teenager because they are typically easier to manipulate and exploit or he actually just likes minors based on his \u201cgentleman wait until they\u2019re 18\u201d comment. \n\nThat comment is an extra red flag because it showed he wasn\u2019t even trying to imply that she would be adult and mature enough to be in a relationship. He was just praising himself for not committing statutory rape.",
            "I am 33 and view 18 year olds as children. I don\u2019t see how you could possibly have romantic interest in someone who\u2019s fresh out of high school at this age. Yes, your friend is a creep, and I\u2019d stop being friends with him.",

The also dated for a bit. \n\nMy friend, now much older, looks back at this as a sort of trauma. She feels completely taken advantage of. She was young and vulnerable, going through mental health problems, barely knew the real world, didn\u2019t know how to deal with grown men yet etc. \n\nAnother example is sadly my parents. My dad was 38 and my mom was 18 when they met. While legal, that relationship was fucked up. They divorced and they both feel incredible shame for being with eachother. \nMy mom feels like her life wasn\u2019t hers. \n\nMain idea: that\u2019s fucked up and it will probably affect the girl when she gets older.",
            "Im 16 going on 17, that\u2019s creepy as hell. If my 35 year old coworker did that to me, I\u2019d cuss him out. I\u2019d also message his mother through Facebook or something and tell her how disgusting her son is, since you know, he\u2019s not much different than a 17 year old I guess.\n\n\nBut maybe I\u2019m just saying all this because I\u2019m a teenager\u2026 and teenagers are dumb because they\u2019re not FULLY MENTALLY DEVELOPED.",

Or he is fetishizing her because he thinks she's naive and inexperienced. \n\nChances are he can't hack it in an appropriate age relationship because women near his age see him for exactly the loser he is.",
            "Yeah that's weird. Even when she turns 18 she'll be a high schooler still. Pretty creepy",
            "Yes! That\u2019s a huge age gap, full ass adult wanting to date a kid.",
            "The weirdest thing about this situation is that he's not an ex-friend. That's grim as fuck.",
            "This dude is a textbook groomer",
            "Homie he\u2019s grooming, that\u2019s sus af. Might need to call someone",
            "Dudes a predator.\n\nGive it 5 years it will only get worse.",
            "Weird isn't the word I would use . It is absolutely revolting . He's basically saying hey you see that litteral child there I really wanna get on that but it's illigal so the moment she turns 18 I'm gonna shoot my shot it's still just as gross but I can't be arrested for it.",
            "Very weird and creepy. Please give your friend shit for this. Often men will only listen to other men and yall need to hold each other accountable for gross shut like this. Part of the reason why men think it's okay to go for \"jail bait\" is because their bros either openly condone it or stay silent instead of speaking out against predatory behavior.\n\n\n\nIf I were you, I'd let your friend's job know that he's engaging in inappropriate behavior with a minor. Even if it might impact or end your friendship, good people don't sit by and do nothing when their friends are creeping on children. If I were you I'd also consider ending this friendship. 35 year olds have NO business dating 18 year olds even if it is *technically* legal.",
            "i, also a 35 year old male, think that anyone under 25ish is a child.  yes, they are LEGALLY adults, but, generally, they are still mentally kids.  \n\nyes, exceptions, i know.  but man, when i was 18, i thought i was an adult.  looking back (half a lifetime ago...fuuuck), yeah, not even close.  \n\nalright, meet you all back here when im 70 for my rant about how 35 year olds are children.",
            "All the people saying it's legal and \"it's between two consenting adults\" are fucking creepy ass dudes themselves. I'd ignore them.\n\nBut to answer, yes it's very fucking creepy and beyond weird. She's basically a kid to him. He's over 17 years older than her. (He's already 35. She's not yet 18.)",
            "Yes. That's grooming. She is a child and he is an adult. They shouldn't have enough in common. This is not someone I would remain friends with.",
            "[deleted]",
            "For me, it starts feeling creepy when people break the \"half your age plus 7\" rule.\n\nIn your friend's case (35/2 +7 = 24), anyone below 24 starts putting him into creepy territory.  So, 17 or 18, definitely creepy.\n\nAlso, google \"ephebophilia\" sometime.  An 80 yo and a 30 yo is in \"meh, they're adults\" territory.  But, when one of the two is still transitioning to adulthood...\n\nEdit: added the last/third paragraph.",
            "People in no stupid questions be like...\n\n\"My friend shot someone in the head, poured gasoline all over the body, lit it on fire, dismembered it, offered the burnt remains to Beezelbub, then blew up a children's cancer hospital, are they a meanie for this?!\"",
            "Yes. I'm 36 an I wouldn't be comfortable asking out women in their 20's.",
            "seems like he is targeting 18 year olds, which seems creepy and being a coworker makes it even more of a risky move. Waiting for someone to turn 18 is what wierdos do, like the olsen twins when they were like 6 years old or what ever, basically every female child actor.\n\ndo they have anything in common, interests, hobbies? Or is his only interest is that she is 18 and attractive?",
            "I'm 40 and work with an 18 year old, i couldnt imagine dating her, she's sooo young. Very sweet and all but dunno what we'd talk about. I made a joke about this leather glove in lost property being like OJ simpson....she said........\"oh i dont watch the simpsons\".....kill me.",
            "\"A true gentleman\" my ass.  What \"true gentleman\" tiptoes on the edge of legality for puss?",
            "He respects the law but cause it\u2019s illegal, he is still a creepy AF, cause he is obsessed with an underage person, what changes asking when she is 18 if he was hooked up when was underage? What will happen when she rejects him? Don\u2019t think he will stop since he has an obsession\u2026\n\nCreepy.",
            "I think it's as weird for a 34 years old to date 17 years old as it's for 35 year old to date 18 years old. Not very normal.",
            "Yes!!! Old mature men have no business asking what for all intentions and purposes is still a child out. Regardless of legality, its just a teenager, with a teenager world view, preoccupations, emotional maturity, you name it. Its a kid ffs.",
            "Definitely a red flag, actually a few if you really think about it.",

            "Ew. You are not overreacting. Your friend is a weirdo walnut...",
            "There is only one reason a 35 year old is talking to a 17 year old in that capacity:\n\nThey have nothing in common with women their age, and refuse to do better to make themselves attractive so they're targeting someone younger that doesn't know better and they can manipulate easier.\n\nYou need to talk to this person and tell them to cut contact now, because not addressing it makes you an enabler of this behavior.",
            "Nah man. I'd respectfully slap my friend upside the head like a gentleman does to a predator lol. Honestly wouldn't be his friend if he doesn't change directions fast.",
            "Older men going for younger girls do it because women their age see they have nothing to offer. Young girls are victims of these types of men because they haven\u2019t developed the ability to set boundaries or know their own worth. \n\nTake a long look at your friend, and you\u2019ll see more than this as the issue. His views might be the same as they were in high school (never matured), he may be terrible with finances, his hygiene, or his time. He also might be controlling or have anger issues he refuses to resolve. Listen to how he talks about women, or people with authority over him, or those who disagree with him. \n\nWomen his age want stability, maturity, and someone who seeks to better himself and engage in life in ways that are meaningful to him. They want someone who knows how to communicate and has done work on themselves to be a better version. They will see his red flags. \n\nThis girl can\u2019t protect herself properly. Even when it\u2019s \u201clegal\u201d she will be a victim. She can\u2019t see the red flags. \n\nShe may fall for the \u201colder dude\u201d if she has low self esteem or a tough life. But there\u2019s also a good chance she has friends who will support her and the wherewithal to tell HR if he pursues her and makes her uncomfortable. Thankfully, the younger generation is more aware of how these creeps work - they know the terms gaslighting and manipulation. But she could not personally know better. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t remain friends with anyone who was pursuing a child.",
            "Gross",
            "Nonces be noncing.\n\nIn all seriousness, this is far from cool. I had a friend who was like this. He can't handle a normal relationship with someone his age (36).\n\nYou did the right thing calling him out. Its grim.",
            "Your friend is a predator, proceed accordingly",
            "You know full well that it is.",
            "I'm 32 and think him waiting for her to turn 18 is grooming. Ya boy should be on a list.",
            "Ew. Predator behavior. No gentleman would be attracted to a CHILD. Kind of makes me assume he\u2019s already been grooming her."
