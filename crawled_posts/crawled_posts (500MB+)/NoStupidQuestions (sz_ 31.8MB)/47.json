I sat on the couch and the dog actually came and sat on the top part behind me. Turns out she was my GF's ex husband's dog originally, but she had got her in the devorce because he couldnt really even take care of himself ( supposedly very childish and wasted tons of money and was indebt with no job). Well turns out he had died from lung cancer from smoking an ungodly amount and was just overall unhealthy.

            "This is actually a great question. The answer is that between pathology and normalcy is really blurry and heavily dependent on cultural norms. Mental illness isn't defined by an absolute set of criteria (like, say, the presence of a virus) but by how certain symptoms affect one's ability to function day to day. While there can be overlap, hearing the voice of God would be considered non-disordered because it's an acceptable cultural experience, whereas believing your dog is talking to you isn't.\n\nBasically, there are no hard and fast rules because we understand so little about the human brain. Treating abnormal psychology is mostly a matter of treating symptoms that are harmful (and even harm can be subjective).",

So you get an overwhelming feeing of compassion and have a feeing like you should help her out.  Some people would say that was some emotional response.  Many Christians/religious folks would say that was God or the Holy Spirit speaking to them.  They attribute their own thoughts to the idea that God is speaking to them.

            "There has been research done on schizophrenia in western cultures compared to schizophrenia in more religious cultures such as Africa or India. [Here's](https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/07/31/the-voices-heard-by-people-with-schizophrenia-are-friendlier-in-india-and-africa-than-in-the-us/) a couple [links](https://news.stanford.edu/2014/07/16/voices-culture-luhrmann-071614/).\n\nPeople from more religious cultures tend to have a more positive, playful relationship with the voices. In other places the voices are largely negative and intrusive.\n\nThis suggests there is a cultural difference that impacts schizophrenia itself, and not just how others perceive it. Religious people may believe they're in touch with god, and do not get flak from their community like they would if they had these same views in America. In Western countries you are considered a looney and should be medicated (generalising here), though.",
            "[removed]",
            "I think you might be misinterpreting two different things as the same.   \n\n\nTo my understanding, while religious people say something like they \"spoke to God\" or \"heard God telling them\" something, they don't mean that they are hearing God's voice in the same way they would another person in the room. Often, despite giving \"dialogue\" to God, they are actually just explaining a feeling or sense they got of God's wishes in a way that other people could understand the significance of. Other times, they do feel specific words have been communicated with them, but in an overtly spiritual way, again, not in the same way as hearing someone speaking to them in the same room. Spiritual experiences such as these, whether you believe in their significance or not, can happen to healthy people of all religions and backgrounds and are not understood to represent a psychological issue.   \n\n\nWhen someone is having a hallucination, they may see or hear things in literally the same way as they hear the radio or see a bird flying outside their window. Apart from applying judgement as to what could or could not be real, they have no way of identifying hallucinations as different from real life. Schizophrenic patients having delusions (false beliefs separate from reality) and hallucinations regularly report religious themes to these and are considered \"crazy\" just as much as someone saying aliens, beings from other universes or vague, unspecified voices in their head are communicating with them.  \n\n\nI have not personally had either experience but that is my understanding of them.",
            "Most people don\u2019t literally mean they hear voices in their head - they usually mean to describe a general feeling of inspiration.\n\nHowever, there are interesting studies showing that in African cultures where it is more acceptable to hear hallucinatory voices (ex: seen as a form of enlightenment), the voices are more often reported as being benign and playful.  In contrast, in Western cultures that shun hearing voices as signs of mental illness, the voices are more often described as violent or negative.",

A wealthy middle class lad or lass who says that they heard god will be dismissed as being religious even when legitimate insane. But when a homeless person or the local school janitor says it... well that\u2019s unnerving. And it\u2019s because we know that the voice isn\u2019t god. Like as a society we know this. But we assume middle class people to also know this. But the poor and underprivileged MIGHT not have the faculties (again we assume as a society) to know the difference. So when the poor say it, we worry because they might not be smart enough to know the difference. But the middle class and the rich are.. rich! They Must be smart enough to know the difference.",

I said I must be doing something wrong, because God never talks to me or hugs me. \n\nI do think signs, events, serendipitous things, etc. happen, and I've had them happen. Call me a skeptic though, because a literal voice is something I can't wrap my head around. If it is considered \"odd\" to talk to yourself, then why is it okay to hear voices and call it divine? And why are those people more special? It would be SO MUCH EASIER if God would just literally tell me what to do instead of making me figure it all out. Haha He made me, he knows how hard headed and dumb I am.\n\nObviously I didn't fit in with the women in that class. lol They didn't like me asking questions.",

            "I'm a devout Christian and a Protestant minister. And I have heard the voice of God exactly once in my life.\n\nI was on a retreat designed to bring up leaders in the church. This was before I was ordained. At one point, the group of us were in a quiet moment of deep prayer. I had been having trouble in my marriage, and my wife and I were arguing a lot about my work travel, the kids, budgeting, typical stuff. I was praying to God for help, peace, something, I didn't know. I was almost in tears. Then I heard it.\n\n\"Ask me what you want, and I'll give it to you.\"\n\nIt wasn't my internal voice. I didn't make it. It was just \"there\". But I knew it was God. Hard to explain.\n\nSo I suddenly knew what I wanted. I prayed for God to take away the anger and frustration I had. I prayed for him to change *me*, so I could relate to my wife better and be a better man for her.\n\nAnd so he did.\n\nI am completely serious. In that moment, it felt like something was lifted off of me. I felt the anger toward my wife and our difficulties disappear. It was replaced by the love I always had for her, and the desire to *serve her* now when she needed me most. I had the desire to put her needs ahead of my wants. My marriage and relationship with my wife has been far, far better ever since.\n\nYears later, while studying scripture, I came across a verse that shocked me, one that I had not recalled ever reading:\n\n2 Chronicles 1:6-7\n\n>Solomon went up to the bronze altar before the Lord in the tent of meeting and offered a thousand burnt offerings on it.\n\n>That night God appeared to Solomon and said to him, \u201cAsk for whatever you want me to give you.\u201d\n\nTL;DR It's not crazy to hear the voice of God.

            "Mental health counselor here:\n\nThe easiest answer here is we don't make a concern of it just on the surface level.  Spirituality and religion has its place in overall well-being and self-care (I'm not saying you HAVE to be religious, just that it can bring a lot of comfort for many people), so on the surface it's good.\n\nAnd actually, I'm not even super concerned if you hear VOICES; it only becomes a concern if they bring distress to your life, and/or it depends what those voices are telling you to do.  If \"God\" is saying \"I love you,\" that's much different than \"go blow that building up.\"  It's also important to distinguish \"was this your conscience, was it a voice coming from inside your head, or outside your head?\"\n\n-Inside is more likely to be things akin to \"parts\" or \"alters.\"  ie., what used to be called multiple personality disorder, but is now dissociative identity disorder.\n\n-Outside is more akin to Schizophrenia, or depression and anxiety with psychotic features.\n\nLastly, I can't give a ton of details because it was more of a one-off passing thought, but I remember very clearly in graduate school the class having a conversation about this, and apparently back in the 60s or 70s, there WAS a lot of controversy about where is the line for this, and again, it may not be a very interesting tidbit but basically we have a manual called the DSM which is our diagnostic \"Bible\" so there were several debates over what should be included in that at the time (I think they were making the DSM-II at the time, we are now up to 5), and ultimately decided that religion has its place.\n\nSo I hope that helps!",

            "First, hearing voices (auditory hallucinations) is a symptom of schizophrenia. So that's why people think \"you must be crazy\" if you hear non-divine voices. Unmedicated people with schizophrenia who have these hallucinations hear them frequently during psychotic episodes. \n\nWhen a person claims to \"hear the voice of God\", they often mean it figuratively. They have a thought that feels like it was received from God. Occasionally, though, they mean it literally. For my whole adulthood, I've enjoyed stories of Christian spiritual experiences, and usually when someone does claim to literally hear a voice from God (or a saint such as the Virgin Mary), it happens once, maybe twice, in their whole lifetime. This is a different pattern from a psychotic person, who may hear various voices and hear them all the time. If you are a believer, you may think these are genuine locutions from God. If you are skeptical about religion, you can write off these experiences as a moment of imagination or a brief hallucination of unknown origin, but it's not the same as having a mental illness.\n\nIf a person hears voices a lot, in all different situations or times of day, and say it's God (or that one of the voices is God), that fits the pattern of mental illness, especially if there is no coherent message over time. There are \"visionaries\" who claim to experience voices or visions regularly, but these are more organized than they are in psychotic people. These may be (a) very suggestible people, (b) hoaxers, or (c) people actually experiencing God (you can dismiss this one if you aren't a believer).\n\nTL;DR: The \"pattern\" of people who say they heard God's voice and of people who hear other voices is different.",

If someone is saying that they literally \"hear the voice of God inside their head\", I think most, aside from religious fanatics, would be concerned, because actually HEARING God is (most likely) a hallucination. \n\nAnother phenomena that will happen is people will have a very strong thought, and they will contribute this to God. I saw another comment where they said that people might interpret \"profound thoughts\" to be their God talking to them. But, having family members with schizophrenia (with a focus on religion), I can tell you from speaking with them that mistaking their own thoughts for God speaking is a common symptom of schizophrenia, and has to do with not being able to separate reality.

            "Everyone is talking about the obvious schizophrenia part, but the less talked about is the spiritual experience part. It's spontaneous subconscious thought that can be easily influenced, and it just happens to everyone to differing degrees. There's more to it than that though.\n\nReligion is the most popular explanation of the spiritual experience, though one can have these experiences without believing in a God [and can be conducted in laboratory setting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_helmet). One particular facet of these is that these thoughts are easily influenced by suggestion. Simply thinking there is a greater power or a guy or gal or angel or ghost or anything looking over you will make them real enough, your brain will fill in the details.\n\nThese spiritual experiences have a dichotomy however. You choose whether it is self-referencing or completely alien without realizing it. Why do we think though that there's someone looking out for us? Maybe it's because it's the best feeling to have as a social creature and really helps us out, even if we mostly take care of ourselves. Not a lot can beat that feeling of a close bond, and believing in a God (I don't mean being religious or ritually going to church and stuff) makes the best of it is my guess. Maybe it's aliens though because it's such a foreign experience. You can have it both ways.\n\nMy guess is that its always existed because we need to sense of things we can't understand, but the consequence is that sensing things that don't exist runs the risk of literally being nonsensical, yet with a firm conviction it exists because you'd still be following the subconscious ruleset bordering on survival instinct. In order words, you look crazy, but your mind will not make you otherwise even if proven wrong unless the underlying process is brought to light.\n\nWhatever percentage of people that actually have spiritual experiences versus the ones that say they are religious for tribal benefit is unknown, though you can imagine there was a lot more zealotry and visionaries back then, enough to have a longstanding religious tradition now (stated at the risk of survivor's fallacy, murder was okay back then).",

The True Israelites are a black supremacist Judeo/Christian group who believe that the ancient Israelites were black, that Jesus was black, and that all black Americans who are the descendents of the West African slave trade are actually descendants of the 10 scattered Israelite tribes. According to this man, who I spoke with at length, nearly 4 hours, heaven is not segregated, there simply will be no white people in heaven at all. According to him (and no, he couldn't site any specific verses on this) the Bible teaches that the \"white Gentiles\" are irrevocably damned from the moment of their birth for the sin of being white. I raised the obvious question to him, why would God create a people with no hope of salvation or redemption? He said that the only reason whites had been created at all, was so that they could be destroyed prior to the return of Jesus, either by God or by the blacks (he wouldn't specify which) and then burn in Hell for all eternity.

I only ever mentioned this weird feeling once before, and I never really heard anyone else talk about it. My first name is only one syllable and it's not common, but combined with my surname, which can also be used as a first name, and a fairly common one, it gets odd.

My brother has called me my name to maybe 10 times in 30 years and it\u2019s either he\u2019s mad at me or he\u2019s teasing me. So yeah he always calls me Sis, even when I\u2019m not there.

My name isn\u2019t very common, I think, I haven\u2019t met anyone with the same name before (went to google for a bit and apparently my name was quite popular).

            "So story time. When I was 16 I started learning about buddhism and meditation. I read some book where an old lady asked the buddha how she could have spiritual progress seeing to the fact that she was constantly working for her family, carrying water and other chores. He told her to just pay attention to every movement she made, everytime she moved her hand or arm or leg to just pay attention to it. I now know that this is a type of meditaiton. \n\nI decided to do it for a while. the next day I woke up and hyper focused on every movement I did. I was doing chores myself around the house, things like washing dishes and vacuuming etc. There were more chores than normal because we were having guests over for a dinner that night. \n\nAfter all day of doing this I felt a sort of calm overtake me, like emotions would just sort of release. After dinner and the guests left I went for a walk. During it I remember thinking to myself \"I am not X\", where X is my name. It felt so odd and weird for me to be associated with the name. I thought it again without being afraid of the feeling.\n\n Then my name and the associated identity released too. For a few seconds, this body perceived the world in perfection. Everything around this body was absolutely crisp and right. Then that passed and elation followed. I was so happy. I saw someone passing and gave them all the money in my pocket. \n\nI saw that my whole identity was linchpinned to my name. I thought that I was many things, but after my name released, so did everything else, and I saw that I was nothing.\n\nMy point of this story is that this post reminded me of those few seconds before I finally released my identity. I had asked different people this same question before, but everyone just says - no.  \n\nI think that I experienced ego death that night. But who is to say? It's been over a decade and it happened again only once, but the second time is different. There is no elation or great shocking identity release, there is just a long fluid peace. The second time the peace lasted 2 hours.\n\nMaybe if you pay attention to you physical movements and have a nice long day of chores you too will release your name and the rest of your identity with it?",

I was named after \"Anakin Sywalker\" (obviously) when I was in my moms womb (2003).\n\n She was watching the prequels and thought the young Anakin would suite my name. My full name is Anakin Lex Bradley D. Bayungan. \n\nAnother reason why I was named \"Anakin\". It's because all our names start with the letter A.\n\nDad: Allan C. Bayungan\nMom: Annabelle C.

Bayungan (A.J.X)\n\nWe are \"A\" family. The 6 \"A's\". Also my parents wanted to pair the acronyms of our name. Like AJX. But ARB/ALB is like a japanese one.

For some reason, people insist on using the other one for me, even though they have no problems saying it correctly when referring to celebrities who pronounce it the same way I do? \nStrangely, for years when I was a teenager I pronounced it the more common way myself. I guess it was just easier that way. \nBtw my husband literally cannot pronounce it my way. He has to over-emphasize each syllable and even then it sounds weird (and I have a fairly common name).

It took some time but now I actually like my name as I got to see it can also be used in a gentle and positive way.\n\nGuess it's just a matter of experience and probably you not being used to being called by your name a lot, or just used to hear it passively when people talk about you.",
            "I hate saying my own name. It sounds weird in my mouth. But also I feel weird when other people say it too, which I think comes from the fact that I hear it very rarely. Names aren't often used in general conversation, so it's a little jarring",
            "I feel weird using other people's names as well, but only to directly address them, not when I'm talking about them to someone else.  I'm not entirely sure why. \n\nOne thing thing that has helped with saying my own name is having a good friend with the same name as me.",

            "The same!",
            "I do too. I haven't specifically looked into this, but here is my idea:\n\nYour name is, well, YOUR name. It's something that people have called YOU for the entirety of YOUR existence. That name is used by YOUR family and YOUR friends to refer to YOU. YOU hear it used so frequently among people YOU know. \n\nIt's used so often among these people that when someone has the same name as you, it's almost like your identity would be erased. You've only heard people call you this name so far, and it's almost like your identity in one word. \n\nThat's also why it sounds FUNNY calling someone else who has your name your name. Because it's like calling someone else you.\n\nHopefully that helped! You can look more into the idea if you like, because this is all just my ideas.",
            "I do care when I say and hear my full name. In my normal day to day life I use the short version what is kind of a protection. Just really close family members and a very few of my closest friends use my full name.",

            "Yeah. I even feel weird when hearing other people say it. Like I don't feel attached to it in any way. I just know that that's a sound I'm supposed to respond it.\nIt's different when I hear someone call my online username when gaming. I actually feel a relation to it because I chose it myself and it's unique, it doesn't feel as weird to say it but I guess that's because it's not \"me\", just a username.",

            "Oh yeah i thought i was the only one. Growing up i had 4 guys with the same name as me at school but i never called them by their first name for that exact reason. But then again i didn't interact with them much anyway. Gone off-track, the point is that i still don't call people by their first name if the person has the same name as me. It feels super weird.",

It's nothing to do with being too personal, it's more to do with the way my brain works.   \n\nI identify things by 'impressions', as in this thing / person gives me THESE feelings. Whenever I see or think of that person, I don't think of their name, the 'impression' of that person is already there.  \n\nIt can sometimes be awkward when I want to talk to someone, or get their attention.

Since school I haven\u2019t ran into anyone with my name (kinda weird). What I find amusing is hearing my name on tv, especially if it\u2019s a real crime show.

So growing up I've had to get used to saying and writing my name (only a dropped letter is the difference between my name and an object). I hear so many puns and I've made them myself.

            "Playing dumb is a good strategy for a few reasons, but you need to be willing to draw the line as well.\n\nIt's a non-confrontational way to try to bring attention to their behavior, and the hope is that the person saying it realizes they are being racist and stops.\n\nBut! If they are shameless or double down on the racism, you should be willing to speak up. \"Oh. Why would you think that's funny? It seems racist/sexist/mean/whatever.\" \"Huh. That seems like a rude thing to say.\" You can keep playing dumb, but don't ignore or condone their behavior.",
            "Yes it\u2019s the best response. It has the most potential to actually inspire positive changes for their future behavior.",
            "It's called the Socratic method. You ask questions to get them to think about what they're saying and expand on their ideas.",
            "I think making them explain why it's funny is a great idea.  And once it's explained you can simply say \"oh, I don't find racism funny\" and walk away.  It's a professional and calm way of calling them out in a work environment.",
            "I do that when someone in line tries to rope me into racism. Like at a gas station they see my 6'2 redneck ass and they'll say \"this Spanish huh? Thought we were in America\" I'll make them repeat it a few times like I didn't hear then say \"maybe learn Spanish if it bothers you.\" Or I also like to say the time if it's in the morning \"it's 9 o'clock in the goddamned morning could you chill out with your racism until everyone's fully awake please\"\n\nI feel being corrected by another redneck really makes them feel like shit. Like \"nope. Your alone in your hatred\"",
            "It's a very good strategy, it makes them uncomfortable",
            "I love it! my co-worker said to me yesterday (honest to God) \"I'm not racist. I'm not. I mean, as long as they act right\"\n\nI said \" 'They'?   you are racist. If you have to tell me every single day that you're not racist, you really are.\"",
            "I think it's a great strategy. make them explain it.",
            "We call this a pause moment in my company. Give them a pause to rethink what they just said. See if they realize their mistake before you give them a different perspective. Doesn't always work, but a good strategy.",

            "This also works great on students making racist/bigoted jokes. When I was doing substitute teaching, I'd loudly ask them to explain their joke and the whole class would watch them cringe into their own assholes, it was great.",

            "Yes and same with perverts when they make perverted jokes. It's make them explain aloud, themselves, what they said and they usually realize just how bad it really is when they have to explain it back. I do this when guys man-splain just to further prove that what they're doing is wasting both our times because nothing is more annoying than a \"I don't get it\" blank face staring at you after you've unnecessarily explained something 20 times..",
            "It's not a bad strategy, per se. A better strategy would be to educate them on the non-racist way.\n\nI have a co-worker who asked me: \"where do you think she's from?\" About a dark skinned girl on the playground. I told him \"she's from *our country*. Maybe her ancestors are from somewhere else, but she and her parents were born and raised here, so it's not very nice to speculate on where she's from.\u201d\n\nHe didn't intend it as insulting, or even racism, just wasn't aware.",
            "Yes! Good for sexist crap too.",
            "Yes! They teach this about sexual harassment as well. Making people actually spell out the horrible thoughts they\u2019re implying gives no wiggle room for them to say you\u2019re over reacting or taking things out of context. It also makes them uncomfortable, as it should.",
            "Always make people explain, racist, sexist, classist etc... comments or \"jokes\" and push it to the extreme in asking for continued explanation.",
            "Last time someone came up to me and said they can't say something about something because they might be accused of being racist, I said don't say racist things and people won't think you are racist. Not that I care, but he doesn't talk to me anymore.",
            "After dealing with quite a few racists online, I've found that playing dumb and getting them to explain the 'joke' (which is usually lol \"black people are dumb/poor/violent\") serves two purposes.\n\n1. Making the joke incredibly unfunny.\n2. Making them out themselves as a racist.\n\nMost of the time people want to be seen as funny and racist jokes are a subset of 'edgy humor.' Also, outing the founding racist assumption immediately outs them as a shitty person, and they know that.\n\nMost of the time they'll dodge around it because they don't want to be discovered tbh.",
            "I constantly use this. Making someone who just made a racist joke explain why that joke is funny is the quickest way to make them feel like a big giant idiot. After, though, I make sure they know that shit won't fly around me.",
            "no, they'll see through your bullshit. \n\nJust ignore it. you're there to make money, not satisfy your coworkers.",
            "I think it's not so much acting dumb as it is clarifying. You want to make sure you heard them correctly and you want to make sure they're not using it differently than you know.",
            "That's what I do, just pretend I don't get it. Unfortunately some people enjoy keeping it going if you keep asking, so it doesn't always work.",
            "This isn\u2019t acting dumb. You\u2019ve just discovered two things: 1) asking open ended questions (questions that require more than a yes/no response) will almost always result in more substantive information, and 2) when you ask why about anything, it helps you uncover what\u2019s driving their behavior, which helps you understand their mindset so much more than other methods. Corporations pay millions of dollars to train their reps to have conversations this way because of how effective it is. \n\nHonestly, what you think of as \u201cplaying dumb\u201d is actually a genius move, and you can use it a lot more broadly than in this one instance.",
            "This is my favorite response to use with racist jokes. If ANYTHING is going to make someone understand why they are being shitty, it's having to explain themselves.",
            "This is my favorite strategy for racist jokes and sexist jokes and inappropriate comments. So I say yes it's a great tactic",
            "I do this with my high school students. It works and it isn't mean of you to do. Forcing them to explain often forces them to see how inappropriate they are.",
            "This is actually the best strategy. They probably wont stop being racist, but they'll stop being racist *around you* which is the next best thing.",
            "I think yes; because, as you said, it will force them to explain and justify what they've said. That way they may be more inclined to understand that what they said/did was racist.",
            "[deleted]",
            "Not a bad tactic, but in the past I have been more direct, but not confrontational, and basically said \"I would say that is not appropriate for work.\" The person was apologetic in both cases. \n\nI think it's important to not be overly confrontational or make it about them rather than the thing they said. That way they still get the message, but they don't feel cornered or dig in and double down.",
            "I was sort-of friends with a dude at a brewery I used to go to, who I know was racist.  One time I came in from a tough day at work, and he started with something racist and I said to knock it off because I wasn't in the mood for ANY complaints about anyone.  The next 10 minutes was complete silence.  It was funny in an awkward way, but I really liked it",
            "What was the \"racist\" comment in question? What is the context? Who or what was it directed towards?\n\nSo much in our current climate can be perceived as being \"racist\" when it might not be. \"Racism\" is highly subjective and interpretable; \"racism\" is in the eye of the beholder. \n\nRight now, there are plenty of people out there who will claim that this comment by me is \"racist\" bc I questioned what the \"racist\" comment was, put the term \"racism\" in quotations, and state that what is deemed \"racist\" is highly subjective.",
            "Maybe not necessarily have to play dumb but legitimately ask for the intention of getting them to think about what they've just said? I'd be ok with my intentions being known.",
            "That\u2019s actually a great way to deal with it. It makes them either a) realize they said something stupid and correct themselves, or b) establish they are indeed pieces of shit.",
            "My friend has dealt with racists at his work. If someone has something to say he\u2019ll politely reply \u201cI\u2019m so sorry sir I can\u2019t hear you\u201d \u201csir, I\u2019m gonna need you to speak up I literally can\u2019t hear you\u201d then they huff and puff out.",
            "Yes. Women have been deploying this method on men who make sexist jokes like we are supposed to understand them/have never heard them/should go along with them. A simple but serious, \u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d seems to, at the very least, stop them from being sexist (in your case, racist) toward you, if not over all, by forcing them to explain it. We all know a joke isn\u2019t funny when one has to explain it.",
            "Yep, hit them square between the eyes, with a bit of the old [Socrates!](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method)",
            "It's my favorite strategy. It's non-aggressive so you're not escalating, there's no tit-for-tat, it's just forcing them to explain their hateful beliefs to you and usually acknowledging that what they said is only \"funny\" if you share them.\n\nAt which point you can tell them you don't share those beliefs, disengage, and maybe even give HR a heads up.",
            "I\u2019ve participated in multiple workshops about how to respond to microaggressions and offensive, discriminatory comments in casual settings and this is always one of the strategies that they list.",
            "Absolutely.        \n\nThe Socratic method is incredibly effective.       \n\nIt's a shame social media doesn't really allow for any kind of long-form debate.",
            "Absolutely! When you tell someone why they're wrong, you'll likely be met with resistance and frustration. Making someone explain why they're right, makes them think through their comment and is more likely to create a lasting impression.",
            "Keep asking \u201cwhat?\u201d As if you didn\u2019t hear them and as they repeat themselves, they\u2019ll start to realize how naive they sound.",
            "Usually when dealing with racists at work, I just tell them in plain English, \u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry, I actually don\u2019t speak English.\u201d",
            "Yes, very. *Always* draw attention to racist behavior, no matter how you do it. You cannot sit by and let racism prosper, because that\u2019s what racists rely on to spread their ideology.",
            "That is one of the best strategies. Humiliate them, make them explain their logic and maybe that will make them realize how much of an ass they are",
            "It's a very good strategy. They don't get appreciated for their \"clever thing\" and you make them confront what an asshole they are.",
            "Don't think of it as playing dumb, its basically the Socratic method.",
            "I asked a manager about a homophobic joke he made and he started yelling and saying I was trying to \"slander his name\"\n\nThat moment is ingrained in my memory for some reason",
            "I\u2019ve found \u201cshut the fuck up\u201d works well.",
            "It only works if you're not the \" sarcastic dumb \" . If you plan on acting dumb, you got to sell that shit like you mean it. Get other people involved in it too, ask them to help \" explain \" the joke to you. Force whomever into such and uncomfortable position that'll he'll just want to disappear.",
            "The best thing would be to say you think thats racist and say you dont like it....move on.",
            "In my experience no matter how much logic you try to argue with someone doesn't matter because to them the logic obviously points to what their saying. People don't have the same idea of what's logical. Not that I know a better reaction besides maybe just ignoring them, their your coworkers not your friends I wouldn't care about them enough to try to get them to see the error of their ways when there's already so much of that their likely seeing in the news right now.",
            "I love 'pretending' to not get jokes and having people explain why they think their inappropriate joke is so funny.",
            "Rather than asking \u201cWhy is that funny?\u201d instead ask \u201cWhat is funny about that?\u201d Asking a \u201cwhy\u201d question will often put a person on the defensive, justifying what they said, whereas a \u201cwhat\u201d question has a better chance of that person analyzing what they said. You may not like what they said, but try not to dismiss them because they said something shitty. We all do that sometimes. Try to go for understanding and how they arrived at what they said instead of trying to \u201cwin\u201d a conversation.",
            "Thing is, I wouldn\u2019t even say it\u2019s really acting dumb. Since instead of just letting them continue to say rubbish without consequences, you actually ask them about their claims and effectively challenge them to explain why they\u2019re the dumb ones thinking that way. \n\nIt\u2019s quite similar to the Socratic method - and he was a very intelligent man.",
            "I can actually confirm this works, but it was about being gay and not racism. Bigotry is bigotry. \n\nI was at the zoo with my both of my brothers, my mom, son, and nephew. One of my brothers is married and the other one is gay with his boyfriend. \n\nMy mom bends down to tend to both of our sons in the wagon, and asks me to hold her purse, so I do. \n\nMy not gay brother starts in with holding a purse remarks, and I straight up call him. I ask, \"I don't see what's wrong with holding a purse? I'm helping out mom.\"\n\nHe dances around the punchline more and I call him again. Like, fucking say something in front of your homosexual brother and his boyfriend. Say it. \n\nHe shut the fuck up.",
            "Oh fuck off, you stole this from a post awhile back and now you're acting like you may not be clever when you know you are, that's why you stole the original idea",
            "Yes. I do it everyday. I like my job and I want to keep it. It takes a toll but at the end of the day... I\u2019m doing me and fuck stereotypes. I don\u2019t play into them, but I ignore what I hear. If someone you have a gut feeling can\u2019t be receptive to changing their mind there\u2019s no point in trying. ESPECIALLY in your workplace. If it\u2019s outrageous enough to get HR involved absolutely. But weigh your battles. Racism shouldn\u2019t be tolerated in the workplace and keep it professional because guess what?

It catches me off-guard because a lot of times it is long-time customers that I thought I knew better. I feel ashamed when I don\u2019t call them out and just awkwardly try to change the subject, but I don\u2019t know how to best handle it or what to do (other than work in a different area with different clientele ASAP).",

            "  Love this strategy. Often things like this are ignored or start a fight. I think calling them out, repeating back what they said, or politely asking them to explain what it means is a great idea.

            "Agreed! Get them to talk more. Test their steel to see if their is any intellect behind their \u201cfunny\u201d words. \n\nHave them explain so much that the joke ceases to be funny.",
            "I've had a coworker recently start posting a bunch of stuff that definitely could be taken as racist. I consider him a friend so I wanted to let him know that even if he didn't intend  the posts to come off that way, they definitely did. Long story short, after a long conversation I basically made him admit that a bunch of his views were based on bias against black people and that that is by definition racism. All he could say was no it's not, and that it wasn't the same. Honestly it bothers me that he is so close minded and unwilling to change his views even knowing they aren't based  on fact.",
            "One of my co-workers was telling me a story once about when one of his acquaintances freaked out because they saw a spider, and during the story he says \"well, you know how black people are with spiders\", and I had absolutely no fucking clue what that was even supposed to mean, I asked him to explain and he says \"whatever, you just don't get it.\"",
            "Why does there have to be a strategy?  If it really is racist, be assertive.  Say it makes me feel \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ and I'd prefer it if you'd keep your comments to yourself.   The fact that you'd want it to keep going or want to play games with the person implies to me that it doesn't bother you that much, and instead you'd like to poke at it for entertainment.  It's like when I was little, we would get in trouble for biting our siblings. I would coax my brother to bite me so I could tattle on him.. The bite was slightly uncomfortable, but telling on him to mommy or daddy was satisfying and worth it.  Matthew 18: 15-17 is as effective and as good of advice as I can think.. And you don't have to be Christian to see how it makes sense.",

I don't even remember the joke. I just remember the punchline was something negative, like \"blah blah blah, faggot.\"\n\nI was full on across the room from this dude, and halfway to white-girl-wasted, when I heard this shit, and I just stood up and went \"fucking, EXCUSE Me?\"\n\nHe, the inebriated, honest-to-God fedora wearing \"m'lady\" motherfucker, REPEATED THE JOKE. \n\nAND then proceeded to say the punchline slowly, as if me not hearing him was the problem.\n\nI made him leave, wasn't my party, or my house, but I didn't care. Drunk me was on a SJW rampage. Pretty much everyone but me and one other person were on the \"he was drunk, and it was a joke\" side after the party, but the fucker had made my shit list.\n\nAnd he never made a homophobic joke in my presence again.\n\nHe also dropped out after his first semester.

Often, racist \"jokes\" are just meanness with the patina of a joke, and this becomes very clear once you have to explain the joke. And indeed, how _do_ you explain what's funny about a joke like, say, \"How do you starve a Mexican\" without sounding almost impossibly ghoulish? Most people's racism doesn't run that deep - or, at least, they have the good sense not to show it in public - so often having to explicitly explain, \"it's funny because I believe Mexicans are inherently lazy and work-shy\" is a bridge too far for them. (And if it isn't, it's often a bridge too far for _someone_ whose opinion matters to them).",

So try to be really aware of what you're asking and where it's going to lead you, and when you find the logical inconsistencies then you either make an argument that attacks the logical inconsistencies or you tie the logic that they're using for that subject to something where they're not applying that logic and point out the hypocrisy.\n\nYou also have to remember sometimes these arguments aren't going to change the person you're talking to, but you might change someone else's mind.

They mostly don't even think themselves racist because \"it's only a joke.\" They typically get defensive or dismissive if you push back against the joke. Facts don't work. Reason doesn't work. \n\nPlaying dumb does. Not only do you \"ruin\" the joke by making them explain it, you also make them **explicitly** say the racist things they infer in the company of other \"good people.\" This is embarassing.

I know they are real people with different personality than their character and different relationships with their ensemble characters off screen, but that slaps me in the face. When a popular show wraps and the cast is on a talk show together or some extra reels on the dvd as soon after the final episode, I can\u2019t enjoy them as people yet, or see them if they have other projects during the run of their show. \n\nI don\u2019t get this effect with all actors from all tv shows I like, if I just see one of them on a talk show during the run of their show even if they are talking about a new project, or the longer they have been acting and I\u2019ve already seen them in many roles, the less it ruins my enjoyment of the conclusion of the show. It eventually fades, I cannot avoid them forever, and then they start showing reruns on some off channel, and I can enjoy it and keep it separate from the actor being a different person.",

So they asked me \"well if you also don't really like the show, why does it affect you like this?\"\n\nBut they don't understand the emotional power of series finales.

Supernatural helped me through hard times though I started watching right after the season 13 finale and it hurts knowing it will end. I grew up with the mcu and seeing one of my first female characters I admired and mt favorite character die hurt me.

            "The Harry Potter series did this to me. I read all the books probably halfway through the movie releases. That already gave me the lost, empty feeling. And each time a new movie came out I knew we were getting closer to the end. I was relieved but also felt strangely betrayed when the last book was divided into two movies. I had already tried to prepare myself for the end when they were like \"Surprise, bitches\" you're getting another movie. In the theater watching the last movie finally I could not. Stop. Crying. Because I knew this was truly the end. Especially since I'd been on this ride with these characters for over 10 years which at the time was almost half my life.",

Good art and good media in general, I believe, is there principally to make us think and feel things we wouldn't necessarily have without it, so when you feel sad or empty after finishing something, I like to think that means it's done its job well.",

            "Shun.\n\nIt's why incel groups are so toxic, there's no path within the community for leaving or \"getting better\"; imagine an alcoholics support group that met in bars and just bitched about how much drinking ruins their lives while getting hammered and that's basically incel groups. They sit around bitching about how much being a virgin sucks while kicking out anyone who could actually help them find relationships.",

            "Shunned. One time I posted on an incel community because when I was younger, I had similarities to some of them because I didn't have luck with women (as I got older I could admit to myself it was because I didn't put any real effort in, not because I was gross and women hated me). I tried to give them a version of the \"it gets better\" speech about if you just put effort into it, and I was hated on. Called a \"fatcel\", which means I only didn't get laid because I was fat and if I lost weight I'd be a normie. They also said I don't count because I'm 6'3 so women are naturally attracted to me.\n\nThey're really delusional to always have some mental gymnastics answer to how they're right/oppressed. They're really no different than many other groups, just way more extreme in their hatred.",

            "i think in the beginning stages of the incel thing the answer would be worship. at that time it was more like a bunch of guys that just *really* wanted to have sex. \n\nNowadays an incel that had consensual sex would probably be shunned though. Most of them are a good bit older and more jaded, they've accepted that a woman will never willingly sleep with them and though they don't like this fact they aren't looking to rectify it. At this point they're so angry at women that I think they might be closer to volcels because they don't want to have a positive relationship with any women, they just want to do violence towards women.",

            "If it's anything like an incel I knew at uni (I didn't sleep with him, I was the target of the aftermath), it'll be used to go even more incel because they'll cry afterwards and declare their undying love to a one night stand. Then, when rejected, will go to a friend of a friend who's relationship they've been trying to torpedo for the last 4 months hoping for pity sex. Then become even more of an incel than before when rejected. They might then contact that same friend of a friend three years later, make weird demands over meeting up, then get upset when told to fuck off.\n\nBasically, in my experience they'll mostly comfort them because the incel will use it to become even worse. They'll feel sorry for him for being taken in by such evil people who just wanted to use him.",

Its a community of bitter, lonely people angry that everyone else is having fulfilling relationships and getting laid and they're not. The idea that yet another person is getting that doesn't make them feel *better*, it just makes them feel worse about themselves.",

            "A lot of people are saying that they shun him but this is not always the case. Sometimes they do, however they have a term for an incel having sex which is \u201cascending\u201d and some communities will be happy for them. Also a lot of people are saying that they will call him a simp. Incels don\u2019t actually use that term very often.",
            "Apologies, but I've never been part of the group, so my opinion may be incorrect.\n\nI think it depends on the context in which one has sex with another.  The narrative (despite the name), doesn't necessitate virginity, nor a 'dry spell'.  From what I understand, these individuals feel excluded due to sexual AND/OR social isolation (specifically romantic interest).  Just having sex isn't the sole (albeit significant) reason for identifying as an incel.  If one maintains a social outcast persona, but has sex in a way that is either disrespectful or outside of social acceptance (think prostitution), the individual maintains a similar status within the community.  It seems that sexual assault may also me applauded.\n\nAgain, I could be wrong.",

            "They get shunned. \n\nI banged a pseudo-incel (involuntarily celibate for sure, but not sexist, just depressed) and I don't think it was a coincidence that one of his roommates who was a real incel cut all ties with him after a big fight they had. \n\nThe argument was, of course, centered around my visits (it was literally about the fact that I had parked in his parking spot one time- he didn't want me parking in his parking spot even if my FWB knew that he wasn't going to be home for like 5 hours). \n\nI stopped being his fwb amiably due to getting into a committed relationship.

And I'm just saying that because it's for the truth for your ego so if you have someone now you know I'd still want the friendship etc.. or it was never realistic anyway because of our different lives etc.. so I know that but just saying I would have.",
            "They shun them. Incel-dom is a worldview that revolves around a sexual heirarchy, in which men are divided into Chads and Betas. A Chad can have as much sex as they want with ease, while betas need to simp in order to have a chance of having sex, and even then they only get \"sloppy seconds.\" (I feel like this is a good time to mention that I am describing this worldview that I do not believe in and actively disagree with.) In the incel worldview, a whether you are a chad or beta is determined by genetics at birth, so no beta can become a chad. The way Incels see themselves is as betas who have seen, called out, and rejected this sexual hierarchy, hence community names such as \"Men Go Their Own Way.\" \n\nSo when an Incel has sex, it's not seen as a victory. It's seen as putting in too much effort for a woman who is less valuable because she's not a virgin or has something else wrong with her. (Once again, this is a terrible worldview that I actively dislike. I do not believe this.) It's seen as buying into a system that oppresses them for meager rewards.",
            "I saw a short youtube documentary that followed an incel and his incel friend group. I really wanted to believe it was a troll or fake or something cuz, they had these fucked up inside jokes that were just hate speech. One of the guys jokes was literally just to shit his pants, like actually fucking shitting his pants. The woman who was in the room with one of the incels (not the pants shitter) could only respond with \"...wow...\". \n\nIt was seriously one of the most fucked things i've ever seen, which is suprising since I've been on r/eyeblech multiple times and nothing has grossed me out like that.\n\nThey weren't just poor, innocent, sad virgins like I thought incels were, they were just so hateful. The Incel being interviewed was actually not bad looking, like if he cleaned himself up he'd probably be a bit above average. A few of them looked like if they would just get out in the world and actually try, they wouldn't have it as tough as they think. They believe women are a scourge that should be turned into servants and sex slaves.\n\nThey're not only shitty, sad, lonely people, they completely refuse to better themselves at all. Because to them, they're the unspoken heroes of society. It's fucking insane.",
            "So I used to browse the incel forums frequently and I had some online correspondence with many of them. What I will say is that the majority of them LOATHE anyone who they feel is above them socially, and this is more true of former incels. It basically serves as a strike against their ideology; namely that society is stacked against them and that they couldn\u2019t achieve meaningful relationships or sexual fulfillment if they tried. The incel who stops being an incel demonstrates that inceldom isn\u2019t necessarily a fixed genetic outcome, much of it is internal and can be overcome. This damages their worldview because they feel they are perpetual victims being forced down by an uncaring society, if they have agency over their own lives then they are at least partially at fault, and that concept is untenable to them.\n\nI\u2019ve personally seen cases in which members of the incel community will actually try to better themselves and come out of their shell so to speak, and I\u2019ve seen them wind up in relationships. The end result is that other members of the community will shun them or outright threaten them. One guy who used to be apart of incelswithouthate deleted his account after getting a stable girlfriend, because he got more death threats than anyone I\u2019d ever seen. These are jealous, vile people by and large.",

            "They just make this sound like, \u201cREEEEEEEEEE!\u201d",
            "Personally i think it's somewhat misleading to assume incels are virgins. Incels are misogynists first and foremost. The mentality doesn't go away if they have sex, get married etc although i imagine it gets more toxic when they've been alone for years. But you can have a family and still secretly think of your wife is part of some manipulative conspiracy and you can also be a virgin and have a healthy view of women.\n\nSo to answer the question, i don't think they'll shun him if he keeps thinking of his wife as inferior. I've seen incel posts from men after their breakup, and everyone is like \"welcome back\".",
            "Shun, theyll say he was never a real incel.\n\nIncel subcultures are hella interesting. One of the terms they use is volcel, meaning voluntarily celibate. Under that umbrella, depending on which subculture youre in: people who are incels because theyre fat are volcels, because they can just lose weight and stop being fat; people who are white and middle upper class are volcels, because they can go to SEAsia and get a trophy wife; and people who are totally average and have decent height but have abhorrent personalities are volcels, because they can just improve their social skills.\n\nthe deeper you go into incel culture, the more gatekeepy they are.",
