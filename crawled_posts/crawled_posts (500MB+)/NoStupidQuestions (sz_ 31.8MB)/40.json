            "Can't speak for other countries but here in Bangladesh poorer families (in rural areas) opt for more children intentionally. Their logic is that if they have more children, their family has more members who can engage in income-generating activities. Like, parents encouraging kids to drop out of primary school to go work for brick kilns, rural stores etc is fairly common.\nSadly, child labour runs rampant among lower-income groups and the relevant laws about this are hardly enforced.",
            "One interesting reason I've heard: young people who expect to move up in their careers wait to have kids til they're more stable/can afford it.  But, if you are broke, and have no expectation of ever getting better jobs or ever being less broke (so a generational povery situation), there's no reason to wait if you feel like you ever want kids.  It's not like tomorrow is going to be any better, financially.",

            "Having babies when you were young and poor was typical back in the day. Women in the work force changed a lot of that. A woman trying to have a career does not need the extra hassles of arranging sitters etc for more than 2 or 3 kids. So they stop having babies and continue on with their choice of employment. More conservative people may prefer to keep the wife at home with the kids and since she is there doing that, what's one more? So they are surviving on a single income.

            "There are a lot of reasons and not all of them apply to every person. \n\nSometimes it\u2019s that they couldn\u2019t afford to keep up with birth control (depending on where you live, especially in red states, free/affordable birth control is very difficult to get and if you don\u2019t have insurance you tend to have a harder time). \n\nSometimes it\u2019s that the pregnancy was unplanned, so getting a better paying job that would require a specialized education or training is harder to do. \n\nSometimes they\u2019re in abusive relationships and are coerced into having more children because it\u2019s much harder to leave an abusive partner when you have even one child, much less more than one. \n\nSometimes people who are in poverty have serious depression issues, and when you\u2019re not doing well, you might think having a child will bring you unconditional love and make you feel better. Not a good idea of course, but people who are depressed aren\u2019t always thinking the clearest. \n\nSometimes it\u2019s what their family did and they see it as \u201cthe thing to do.\u201d \n\nThere are loads more reasons, but I do want to point out that it\u2019s usually a lot more complicated than \u201cpoor people are stupid and don\u2019t know unprotected sex gets you pregnant\u201d or \u201cpoor people have tons of kids for the welfare.\u201d The former is pretty unfair- being poor and even uneducated doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re an idiot. And the latter does happen, but not nearly as often as people say.\n\nEdit: plus, pure and simple- most people want kids and if poor people waited until things were financially perfect to do it, they\u2019d often never be able to.

            "I have a cousin and we used to be really close but I personally think she was coddled to much. Pacifier till 7, baby dolls till 15. No recourse for her actions ever.

And the older generation in my family are super religious so they talk her into keeping the kids. A friend of mine suggested she might have baby doll syndrome.",
            "Psychological reasons: sex is one of the few joys that the poor can experience. Contraception costs money that they don't have, either directly (i.e. having to pay for contraceptives) or indirectly (i.e. having to make time and spend money to travel to places where they give away condoms, and dealing with the assholes outside the Planned Parenthood)\n\nFinancial reasons: Spawning is incentivized in the US. Thresholds for government support are higher the more members of a \"household\" there are. Tax credits, WIC, food stamps, section 8, etc. are all easier to get and more generous if you have a horde of children. Even without those,  having 15 people to spread the costs and efforts needed to maintain a household across, makes existence much more viable. Having 15 incomes to draw from as the kids enter the job market, means when the parents are broken and no longer able to support themselves, the chances of the parents getting support from at least some of the kids is higher.\n\nSocietal reasons; again in the US, social mores are largely dictated by the pseudo Christian majority, and a disproportionate number of the poor have been indoctrinated into that group. Their \"be fruitful and multiply\" mandate is drilled home from an early age, and they are kept from experiencing opposing that doctrine until it is deeply entwined with their personal identity.\n\nThere are others as well, but those are the ones I can think of off the top of my head.",
            "Economically\u2014sex is free, and healthcare/contraception is not. Poor people are less likely to have easy access to contraceptives, but just as likely as anyone to have access to sex. Take that and average it out along a whole population and you\u2019ll have more instances of unprotected sex.\n\nCulturally\u2014it\u2019s complicated. For some cultures, it\u2019s the norm for a person to want a large family. If those same cultures happen to occupy a poorer class in some areas, that can give the image that poor people in general have more children. For some people, a family could also be the one positive thing they feel is within their reach. For others, it could be a hope thing. You can\u2019t hope it will be better for your kids one day if you never have kids.\n\nI\u2019d also like to caution you in considering these birth rates to be irresponsible in some way. It\u2019s fine to note trends and contributing factors, but going into the weeds or should/shouldn\u2019t these people be having *this many* children, is a slippery slope into discussing whether they should be having children at all. Once you get there, you\u2019re discussing eugenics.",
            "The cycle of poverty explains it. When you live out of the mindset of lack, your brain functions on a different level than a brain functioning on \"abundance\". That means your decision is off-point, you may be more vulnerable to rape, and have less access to contraception and abortion. The fear of \"I am missing \\[blank\\]\", higher risk of pregnancy, and lower access to getting rid of pregnancy, means you end up having more kids. \n\nAlternatively, that's a power structure. Young women are often married off young after being brainwashed into believeing their only value is being a breeding pet. They also usually don't make it to university, so education and sheltered childhood certainly play a part.",
            "Lack of good sex education.\n\nThey are from cultures that value families first.\n\nSocial pressure.  All their friends are having kids and their parents and relatives constantly bombard them with \"When are you going to have kids?\"  Fear of being seen as the weird one or fearing questions about their sexuality often comes into play.  Some people really fear being seen as the odd one out.\n\nWorried that if they wait too long, it'll be too late.\n\nA big one is no reason to put off or avoid having kids.  They aren't planning to go to graduate school or vying for a top level career.  If they do have career plans, then having a child isn't necessarily going to interfere with that, or in some cases, like politics, it might help.  Or they aren't career oriented and family is their top priority.\n\nLow self esteem or emotional immaturity.  If their upbringing involves abuse or neglect, they may decide they want to get married and have kids right away to provide themselves with the love they have yearned for their entire lives.  Sadly, sometimes this is before they realize they aren't emotionally or psychologically ready to have kids.\n\nIn the same vein, desperation to get their adult lives started.\n\nEdit: Expounding on the last item, it's not just childish impatience as I might have conveyed.  Richer people in relative comfort can afford to wait because they see it as a promise that will eventually be delivered.  For poorer people, waiting is often a sacrifice with no end in sight.  They get sick of being told to wait, and in some matters that they can help, like getting married and starting a family, they decide they've been waiting long enough and it's not going to get majorly better in the future, so why not have kids now?",

            "Being poor affects impulsivity which leads to poorer choices. Many poor people will make the most immediately gratifying choice (e.g., sex without a condom) or the easy choice rather than the sensible one. This makes sense because, if your daily life is one in which you have little to bring you joy and if you're in state of high stress, you will grab what pleasure you can when it comes. \n\n[https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2014/08/growing-up-poor](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2014/08/growing-up-poor)\n\nI grew up poor and there was also an economic issue. Poor people get food stamps and economic support per child. I actually had a cousin who married a woman who, as her kids got older, asserted that it was time to have another child to keep the entitlements coming. I know this is the typical \"welfare queen\" stereotype (which I don't embrace), but I did have (white) relatives who kept having kids to get money. Another one of my cousins has made it her mission to take in each of her grandchildren under her care so she can collect Social Security for them as supposedly \"abandoned\" by their parents. They sort of are left to her because her kids haven't turned out to be the most productive people by a long stretch, but she asked to have them live with her for the money. \n\nThere is also the issue of feeling that you're loved and valued in a world which has put you in a box which says you have no value. If you don't work or can't work, you can be a parent and hold a role which is socially valued. There may also be some sense of security that having more people around when your life is one disaster away from total collapse.",

            "Well you get different answers depending on who you ask, and though there are no stupid questions, there are certainly stupid answers.  No one \"knows\" but reason put forward include:\n\n1. Rural Labor - in the 18th and 19th century, rural families had the \"maximum\" number of kids to have more hands to tend the fields.  Same reason we don't go to school in the summer in the 21st century... because we needed the kids to farm in the 18th and 19th century and just forgot to change the rules.\n2. Perverse incentives - In the 20th century, there was a period of time where certain social safety nets were tied to the number of children.  The amount of aid given never overcame the financial burden of the children, but before doing a 10 year plan, it seemed like more kids would generate more aid.\n3. Religion - As recently as the early 20th century, birth control was grounds for being expelled from certain churches and \"condemned to hell\".  What's more, in these religions having more kids is considered \"more holy\".  Something about \"be fruitful and multiply\".  There seems to have always been a correlation between poverty and blind faith in religion (aka \"external hope\").\n4. Elderly care - Before Social Security, the only way to ensure you would not starve when you were old was to hope one of your kids would take care of you once they became established.  If you were poor, you may have hoped more kids would increase the odds that one of them would have enough to take care of you when you were old.\n5. Lousy Schools - Most middle schools and high schools do not teach home finance.  Some used to teach \"home economics\" but those classes were how to cook, not how to balance a checkbook, budget, and invest.  It seems impossible to do this things on minimum wage, but the sad truth is that budgeting and investing will always be needed to break poverty cycles, even when poor.  Part of these long term planning sessions include questions about the cost of raising children, but again... it just isn't taught anywhere anymore.  This leaves these lessons to the parents, some of which were never taught this info in the first place.\n6. Access to birth control - Programs that hand out condoms or other birth control to kids always gets shot down in favor of abstinence programs.  Wealthy families usually have more free time to provide this info and BC to their children.\n\nAlthough many of these points (1,2,3,4) are not relevant today, it does create a cycle.  Just like summer holiday is a \"left-over\" from generations of summer holiday without really explaining why it is needed today.  If children are poor and raised in families with many siblings, many aunts, many uncles, many cousins, they just see that as \"normal\".",

            "It's a nuanced situation. One factor that contributes is that having children very young can lead to or keep someone in poverty long term, and if someone starts having kids young they often have more years that they're having kids. Someone who waits to have kids until they're 30 so that they can establish their career is very likely to have fewer kids than someone who starts having kids when they're 15. Additionally, there are many cultural elements involved when it comes to many groups that experience poverty at higher rates regarding having big families. Also, poverty goes along with less access to sex education and contraception. And, many people find a lot of joy and meaning in both sexual relationships, which may lead to children, and in parental relationships, which may leat to people wanting more children. When something brings you joy and meaning, you may want more of that, regardless of your financial situation. And, if you were raised in poverty and have a positive view about your childhood, you might not see a problem with your kids growing up the same way. Also, when you feel like there's no hope of improving your financial situation but you do want kids, you may give up on financial stability and have kids without waiting. I've heard many people tell me stuff along the lines of \"don't wait until you're financially stable to have kids, because then you'll never have kids\". There are many more reasons why poorer people tend to have more children, but these are some of them.",

Poor people are the type of people who come from broken homes, single mothers, parents who worked multiple jobs, areas of high crime/violence, high SA rates, etc.\n\nThus, poor people are more likely to be yearning for love and stability. When they find this even just a little bit in another person, they trust quickly and go all in (or some go the complete opposite direction with trust issues.) They continue to fill holes by having children. They crave the love and normalcy of having a family. When these relationships don\u2019t work out, the hole gets bigger and they fall in love quickly with the next person who shows them love and security. More kids come along.

The only solution is like another redditor said, frontline workers and programs need a bigger budget!",
            "Birth control takes knowledge (where to get it, what are the options, how to use it effectively, etc) & access (doctor, money, time, energy).  Poor women -- usually the responsible party -- are the least likely to have the information or access.  \n\nAnd, logically, the larger the family, the harder the hit from job loss, medical problems, etc., so the more likely assistance is needed -- i.e., you are seeing a select subset of people.  \n\nViewing multiple children as 'irresponsible' is in the save vein as legislating abortion.  Why do YOU get to decide how many is too many for other people?   A child costs over $200,000 to raise -- do we only allow people with that much in secure investments to have *any* children?  \n\n Although large families are no longer standard, & I can't imagine how people can afford any kids, I'm just not going to judge those with lots of kids, because it's really none of my business.  And, no, I don't mind if my tax dollars go to assist them.",
            "Little to no sex education, contraceptives, and abortion rights have a big part to play in superseding peoples \u201cchoice\u201d to have kids. What\u2019s irresponsible is not providing these people any 3 of those things. The issue involves many variables, but the propaganda of abstinence isn\u2019t healthy.",
            "Internationally this is the case by a large margin. In the US it's also true but by a lesser margin.\n\nhttps://www.statista.com/statistics/241530/birth-rate-by-family-income-in-the-us/\n\nThe answer to \"why?\" In the US is fairly simple. There is a correlation between poverty and having lots of kids. For single mothers having one child is financially and time-wise doable. A single mother with one child can usually work and support herself and her child. Having more children means that this becomes harder and harder especially if there is no family support. So by having lots of children people keep themselves in poverty. This is the same for married couples, the more children the more difficult it is to have a two-earner household. Meanwhile people who are more wealthy plan their families more often than not. They are wealthy because they didn't have kids early on and instead focused more on their careers and educations first. Then when they have a kid it's usually later in life and so the window to have a large family is small. Less children=more opportunities.\n\nThen internationally countries that are mostly aggrerian have many children because the children act as labor and the family's social safety net. It's a \"traditional way of life.\" That makes total sense for an aggrerian way of life but not an urban one, at least not an urban one with child labor laws.",
            "Both my kids are accidents. Most poor people aren't trying to have multiple kids, but when your rent and bills take up 80% of your income, you sit at home alot. That leads to a lot of sex if you live with your S.O. which you probably do because living by yourself is a luxury. Top that with the state interfering with family planning and OTC birth control costing an arm and leg, you end up with unwanted babies. And don' reply with \"then dont have sex\" that's an idiotic response. Adults have the right to recreational sex and the benefits we get are usually less than what we pay in taxes anyways, so it's not a detrement to societ despite popular belief.",
            "Theres several reasons, generally. First, poverty limits access to sex education and leads to unplanned pregnancies. Lack of acess to healthcare also prevents family planning and abortion. Second, the more family members you have the more working hands you have who can generate income for the family. Also, in many countries, especially developing ones, having many children is the norm due to reasons one and two in addition to high child mortality rates",
            "Speaking specifically to the US\u2026 access to affordable healthcare and contraception isn\u2019t as available to lower income people\u2026 many of which in red states that have limited resources to lower income people\u2026 this is strategic in some cases cuz they are then raised and vote to keep their situation as it is"

            "The gynecologist probably needed to know if sexually transmitted diseases were a potential factor. The mental health professionals might have been concerned about some deep seated issues or repressed feelings. Also some hormonal imbalances and medical conditions can cause a lack of sex drive, which might have been their concern. Just be assured that although out of the \"expected\" or norm, you aren't \"wrong\" or \"defective\", just different.",
            "It\u2019s not important it\u2019s just somewhat commonplace. Your gyno would ask as it would have an impact on the line of questioning they need to consider and they would ask twice because if you were omitting details it could impact their capability to make a decent decision. A psychologist and psychiatrist would take an interest as how people view sex can have a bearing on how they see the rest of the world. Other people asking are just being nosy, which is a dick move imo, but as long as you\u2019re generally ok with your own views on it you have nothing to worry about.",
            "That\u2019s just living as someone who is asexual. If the drive for it just isn\u2019t there, you don\u2019t need to care about having sex. The problem is that people don\u2019t understand asexuality or believe in it and that probably makes it a lot harder for you. You know what your wants and needs are, so just keep living your life.",
            "To play devils advocate. Sex is an awkward topic for most people particularly a situation like a doctors visit. It is probably a very common occurrence for patients particularly teenage and youngish patients to lie about sex. Like others have said it is important for doctors to have an accurate account of our history to provide the best treatment/diagnosis. I\u2019d like to believe they only asked twice to try and judge your body language to see if you being dishonest.\n\nSex isn\u2019t important. Plenty of people are happy having sex, plenty of people are happy not having sex. It\u2019s like most things the issue arises when people become obsessed with it. You are a completely valid person, your life is your own and no one else\u2019s. We have to find our own happiness, and each of us does it differently. And if you do have questions about your sexuality there are asexual subreddits you could go and ask question to the people there and see what you can learn about yourself. Good luck kid",
            "I appreciate this post. When I got my first pap smear around 20 or 21, I had not yet had sex. The doctor clearly didn't believe me (prior to all the poking around down there) -- he asked again, I repeated my answer, and he said, \"Yeah, OK\" and stopped just short of rolling his eyes. \n\nI felt disrespected and mocked for a personal choice that was important to me (at the time, lol). It's not nice to be called a liar by someone you've just met right before they shove a speculum into you.\n\nOf course they have to ask, and of course most people in their early 20s have had sex, and of course a lot of young people might lie to their gyno about it. But when a patient is outside of what's normal, the doctor shouldn't be the one to make them feel wrong and defective.",

They use those questions to see what you and potentially future partners are at risk for and decide what tests are needed.

If a professional is treating you in that manner, I\u2019d recommend you sever the relationship and find someone new. \n\nAs for friends or other random people asking about your sex life, that is rude and unnecessary (unless it\u2019s a close friend because they are probably just trying to learn more about you).

Being annoyed that your patient is sexually inactive is extremely unprofessional for a psychologist. I know this because it was my study and I've been seeing psychs for over a decade. That is not professional behavior of a psychologist. \n\nFor the psychiatrist, it is very interesting that you're not sexual at all. It's rare. And it's probably important when trying to prescribe you medications, as psychiatrists do, because many meds impact your sex life. If you have no sex life, it's useful to know that as they can use different drugs that many people might not like because it lowers libido/ability to orgasm. \n\nFor some people, sex is super important. For others, like you and partially like myself, it's not really a big deal. I like sex but it's not the greatest thing in the world like people act like it is. But for some people, sex really is that great and that important. \n\nIf you're asexual, that's all there is to it. Just let any future psychologist/psychiatrists know this and they can work backwards to diagnose you from there. Maybe you're not truly asexual but rather have some trauma, but they would need to work backwards to find this out (I'm not doubting you're asexual, but I'm explaining why a psychologist/psychiatrist might ask probing questions as many people become essentially asexual after being sexual assaulted or abused). \n\nFor the gyno it might make sense, but it's weird he would repeat the question.

Some people are Red Sox fans, and that's begrudgingly accepted, but you must be from another planet if you don't like baseball at all.\n\nWhen I was 28, I finally got around to having sex just to settle with myself that I wasn't basing my entire identity on something I was afraid of rather than uninterested in. It wasn't exciting. After that partner and I broke up a few months later, I haven't bothered having sex again in the 4 years since.\n\nBut there's no winning this conversation with allosexuals most of the time. Even if you push back with, \"I did try it, and I didn't like it,\" they'll just say your partner was no good and you should keep trying.

Some people seem so preoccupied with sex they can't fathom someone being different. There are a surprising amount of people who are really bad at empathy and seeing things from another perspective.  Just because it's important to them doesn't mean it has to be important to you.\n\nAs to why it's important, I'm assuming it's a biological inclination. I mean if no one WANTED to have sex, there certainly wouldn't be so many people running around. Back when life was harder and fewer people survived, having more people was an evolutionary advantage.\n\nIt can be difficult contemplating something being so important to someone else, when it seems so trivial to oneself.",

One of my symptoms was a reduced (but not absent) libido.",
            "https://psychology.stackexchange.com/questions/19662/is-maslows-hierarchy-of-needs-really-accurate-at-labeling-sex-as-a-physiologica\n\nIn Maslow's hierarchy of needs, sex is one of the most basic psychological needs and that it is needed for self-actualization.\n\nQuoted from one post : \n\n\"there is pretty clear evidence that asexually-identifying individuals are targets of prejudice and discrimination (e.g., MacInnis & Hodson, 2002), and so just as--if not more--likely that their mental health challenges are the result of chronic stigmatization of their identities/sexual orientation\"",
            "i am the same as you, i have no interest or experience. put simply, i think its 'important' because the majority of people just naturally have those desires and urges. so if anyone comes across someone who doesnt, given that it is statistically unlikely, they are surprised/confused and want to know more.  im sorry that your gyno didnt believe you and that the psychiatrist seemed annoyed, that sounds really unprofessional to me even if there are valid reasons for them to ask. also lots of people arent even aware of asexuality, so thats probably why people find it 'weird'. as some other commenters have mentioned, it can be a sign of something else (repressed feelings or low sex drive due to hormones or something), so its fair enough for a medical professional to want to know more, but aside from that, it isnt that important, because on an individual level, it isnt that important to you. id say if people are acting like your opinion on sex is important to them in a casual social situation and giving you a hard time about it, its not because its **actually** important, since it doesnt affect them and all, theyre just surprised since they probably never thought about it as a possibility before. maybe you already do this but if you want to meet other people who, like you, dont think sex is so important, i know there are ace communities especially online that you could probs check out.  \nedit: fixed weird phrasing that didnt make sense  \nedit: did it again",
            "Often, people will lie about their sexual history to anyone that asks. Some people say they've slept around more or less than they have. Some people will say they've never even thought about sex, no sir not ME! This is gonna be heavily varied based on location, culture, and surely other factors I'm forgetting. \n\nAnother situation is there are hormone issues and other medical or mental things that can cause low to absolutely zero libido. For a healthy person with no issues having no libido might be a bit strange, but it's not unhealthy. As an example I'll use myself. I have Hashimoto's Hypothyroid disease. It is an autoimmune disease where my body attacks my thyroid. Your thyroid has a massive amount to do with just about all your hormones, and if it isn't working right everything can be off. Depending on how my thyroid is doing I go from what a normal libido would be to absolute zero desire, and it fluctuates pretty often. \n\nAs far as social viewpoints, humans (and many other animals) are social creatures. You've possibly heard the saying \"birds of a feather flock together\" essentially meaning that people tend to hang around those they are similar to. Most people have sex and enjoy it a lot, so it can be confusing to some people when someone goes against what they know to be \"normal\". \n\nSex can also be infinitely important to romantic relationships. You can be asexual and be in a romantic relationship, but that takes either another asexual partner or compromise, communication, and compassion from both parties. An asexual person and a non asexual person can compromise a few ways, either the asexual person is ok having \"maintenance sex\", the non asexual person is ok having zero sex, or the asexual person decides they're ok with the non asexual person seeking sex elsewhere. \n\nIf you've been seeing mental health professionals that are questioning you heavily and make you uncomfortable then I'd recommend trying to find one that is LGBT+ friendly. There are still many people in the medical field that are dismissive to outright hostile to people that are LGBT+ and otherwise not \"normal\". \n\nI want to end this hideously long comment by saying that I don't have all the information or all the answers and I'm sure that there are things I'm missing. But I've gone through not really caring at all about sex to wishing I could just make myself want to care becuase my bf is fairly high libido and it is fun, I just am typically less interested than he is. There's nothing wrong with not caring about sex, don't let other people make you feel bad for not wanting to do the same stuff they want to do.",
            "It\u2019s generally abnormal to not have sex or notable sex drive by a certain age as it implies there\u2019s something obstructing your sexual growth.\n\nThe cycle of life and the purpose of every biological life form is to reproduce, which for humans means sex, it\u2019s quite literally the things you\u2019re born to do, so medical and mental health professionals would wonder why you aren\u2019t pursuing it as you\u2019re deviating from the classically defined development of a healthy person in a pretty considerable way.\n\nIs it important? No absolutely not, if you don\u2019t care about sex you could have many reasons why and as long as it isn\u2019t hurting you the there really isn\u2019t anything wrong.\n\n**In short they care because of you\u2019re developmental growth and psychological health, not because it\u2019s \u201cimportant\u201d to do.**",

You can't be fixed. So they are powerless, which sucks to feel as a provider of medical care, especially psych care. That being said, you don't need fixing most likely, just more understanding as to why you want less/none sex than most of us. I hope we all get better care though, sexual/asexual people alike, especially those who aren't quite either of those labels, it's a spectrum. I actually really hate the term asexual because it makes the difference between hyposexual (disordered) and generally asexual but has sex occasionally, very blurry.

Our skin literally evolved to protect us from radiation, you are microwaving yourself (a little) every minute you spend outside. \n\nI assume you wouldn't be planning to go in naked, so clothing would also protect you. Microwaves are HUGE as far as electromagnetic radiation goes and bigger waves of radiation are stopped easier by layers of various material. \n\nAlso on top of being risky if anything fails... it's *really* hard to get a big microwave to actually heat anything. Microwaves are so big and clunky (again, I have to stress, just as far as electromagnetic radiation is concerned) that it's hard to get a proportional magnetron tube to actually hit anything inside it. Even modern microwaves use a reflective fan to help bounce the microwaves around inside your *home* sized one because without help it's impossible to get them to penetrate evenly.\n\nThe only thing I would be concerned about for a human being being microwaved in a giant microwave is any exposed soft tissue. You could burn your eyes/nose/ears/mouth if you were unlucky enough to be hit there.. but even then you do still have epithelial cells that can absorb a decent bit of radiation. \n\nYour cells are experts at sacrificing a few to save the.. well *you* and you do have epithelial cells on all those soft tissues that heal extremely quickly (which is why you burn your mouth and you can usually forget about it in an hour).",

            "Microwaves only penetrate 4-6 inches into living tissue before running out of energy, so first off on that point alone at least your deepest tissues would be safe.\n\nThat said, being exposed to a full body microwave beam would be incredibly unpleasent and would almost certainly set off every pain receptor across the entire surface of your body simultaniously as the lions share of the water molicules in your body abruptly begin to rapidly heat up. This is a case where \"all of it\", really does mean ALL of it too; this includes delightfully sensitive spots like the inside of your eyes, brain, heart, reproductive system, and - joy amoung joys - your bladder. Imagine taking a piss consisting of already boiling urine atop everything else here.\n\nSo yeah you might SURVIVE that for maybe 2-3 seconds. But it would probably render you blind almost immediately, deaf shortly after, and wishing you were dead for a very very long time after that.\n\nIf i'm not mistaken the united states military actually fabricated (or at least prototyped) a projected energy weapon that is effectively a microwave source on a swivel intended to intensely disable high priority targets. From what little i've heard about this system, test subjects discribe even short exposures as akin to being lit on fire.\n\nSo far as actually dying and/or causing severe general tissue damage? I don't exactly have data to back this up, but depending on the health, age, and overall condition of a subject I would expect anywhere from 15 to 60 seconds of direct microwave energy incident across the whole body would either be fatal of put the person well and truely on the path to death.\n\nAs for \"burning\" you with microwaves? I'm not sure that really works that way. Microwave radiation, at least the specific variant we're all familiar with in our lovely kitchen appliances, are specifically tuned to cause water molicules to heat up. So you don't so much 'burn' as... boil from the inside out. Stick a chicken leg in the microwave and see how long it takes to get 'hot'. The system would do the same exact same thing to you - so you tell me at what heat level you consider yourself to be 'burnt' - and check the timer on your microwave, and that'll be your answer.",

While the effects would vary depending on the power of the microwave and the duration of exposure, even brief exposure can lead to harmful consequences.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Microwave radiation heats body tissue:** Just like food, human tissue contains water molecules that absorb microwave radiation and convert it to heat. This can lead to burns, even at relatively low power levels.\n* **Certain tissues are particularly vulnerable:** The eyes and testicles are especially susceptible to damage from microwave radiation due to their limited blood flow, which makes it difficult to dissipate heat.\n* **Internal organs can be affected:** Prolonged exposure can cause the internal organs to overheat, leading to organ failure and death.\n\nWhile some sources speculate on potential short-term survival after minimal exposure (around 30 seconds), the potential for severe burns and internal damage makes even brief exposure highly risky. The FDA strongly advises against intentionally exposing oneself to microwave radiation.\n\nHere are some additional points to consider:\n\n* Microwaves are designed for heating food, not humans. Their safety protocols are not designed for human exposure.\n* The effects of microwave radiation are cumulative. Even if you don't experience immediate symptoms, repeated exposure can increase the risk of long-term health problems.\n* There are many safer ways to heat food or generate warmth.

Yes, this happens in a wave pattern, but it happens *completely* everywhere it touches the wave, which is what creates ridiculously hot spots and cold spots.  One way around this in the microwave, is to put your food far from the middle, so it spins and moves through the most wave area.  However, in spite of being created to \"thaw mice alive\", they didn't thaw them without damage.  And the medical uses we have for them are to specifically damage cells we want to die (like cancer).  Microwaves damage the living tissues they touch, even if we can heal from the burns, we get burned.

The reason the sparks occur is because the edges of whatever you put in are likely to have sharp edges.\n\nAnother thing I read about and tried and can confirm it works is if you cut a grape in half and rest them against each other, it sometimes creates a plasma looking blob of light over the grape halves.",

            "Reposting my comment here, but I did the calculations for cell damage in eyes and nerves to roughly 800+/-700 Watts for 120 seconds in a human sized microwave oven.\n\n\"Cells can be damaged by temperatures as low as 42\u00b0C (107.6\u00b0F) with dielectric heating ([source is Biological and Medical Aspects of Electromagnetic Fields](https://books.google.com/books?id=80GjHM2UVIoC)). For near-field 2.45 GHz, and eye lens temperature of 41\u00a0\u00b0C (105.8\u00b0F) is sufficient to cause cataracts in rabbits ([source is Advances in Electromagnetic Fields in Living Systems](https://books.google.com/books?id=QbSvENfgdo0C)).\n\nThe perception for pain starts at 45\u00b0C, so that's why OSHA sets the limit for microwave exposure to 10 milliWatts/cm\\^2 for a BRIEF excursion. That's 0.01 Watts per square centimeter. Exposure to microwave radiation can cause serious damage to critical cells like your peripheral nerves and eye cells before the threshold for pain is even reached.\n\n>\n\nUsing a BSA table, the OSHA energy limits for a man-sized microwave with perfectly uniform radiation distribution would be around 85+/-10 Watts...depending on the size of the person. Looking up microwave threshold for pain tests, [(source) which apparently was perfectly ethical to study in 1952](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1392429/), the lower pain limit for something around 2.4 GHz would be about 0.25 W/cm\\^2 over 120 seconds, or roughly 25 times the OSHA allowed microwave exposure limit.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that microwaving an adult human in a person-sized microwave oven for greater than 120 seconds and a power greater than 1500 Watts, will very likely cause damage to the eye cells and peripheral nerves cells. Hence, when cooking an adult human in the microwave, the time must be kept shorter than 120 seconds, and less than 100-1500 Watts to prevent cell damage.\"",

There are no policies in place in any undergraduate university requiring students to mismanage their schedules or their finances. When this happens, it's at the decision of the student themselves.\n\nThere are many full-time college/university students who work full time jobs (8-9 hours a day, 5 days a week) and have a full-time load of classes. They might go to work 8-5, then go to class from 6-10 every night. Many of them also have children and spouses as well. I could understand if they are tired be because that's a lot of work.\n\nBut traditional students take 2-4 classes every day, which last 1-2 hours per class. The rest of the time they have is free to study and socialize, and activities. Some work part time jobs. The socializing and activities are by choice - they're not required, just fun. So if they manage their time well, they should have plenty of time to study and get a good night's rest. The same with their finances. They could either work all summer and on breaks for money to have during the school year and then budget that money carefully, or they could work part-time jobs in the afternoons or evenings and still have plenty of time to study.\n\nIf you're a a traditional student (meaning you went to school right after high school, have no children, no spouse, no household or job to manage) that is perpetually sleep deprived, then that is your choice.

Unlike high school or full time workers, college students often have different schedules on different days of the week, which makes it harder to stay on the same consistent schedule.\n3. Shared dorms. Given how cramped living spaces are, if either one of the students living in a dorm room has an erratic schedule, it's going to be harder for the other one to stick to a schedule.

As we live farther away like before and after college, it's harder for people to do that.\n4. Newfound freedom.

It's also surprisingly difficult to get people to sign on because they don't believe you can make the money I do.\n\nConcerning that money, I gave the most positive extreme example. The reason it's still a second job and not a primary is because there's no way to know how many bags will be lost. You can't even average it out on a monthly basis. Some weeks there's nothing and others you're overwhelmed. The way it works at the company I work for (which has a very good boss/owner) is the further you travel, the more money you make.\n\nSome places contract the deliveries out to companies like UPS or Fedex.

            "Listen to me-I was there.  I was one of the few Americans allowed to travel behind the Iron Curtain in 1976.  I was just an average American traveling there three months with my grandmother (long story how I got a visa).  It was a dark nightmare.  Everyone was afraid.  There was a pall over everything.  Needing to find a police station, I asked a citizen carrying groceries where the police station was and she dropped her groceries and ran.  I asked another you young couple strolling and all the color went out of their faces and it looked like that had seen death.  They too ran away.  I asked two more people before I realized these people are so terrified of the police, they can't even hear the word without panicking.  They feared that through me, they might have some contact with the police.  The government gave a test to youth to determine their future jobs and education.  Many were conscripted into the military.  Many were sent to the mines.  The economy was a weck.  The fields were not well maintained and food production was poor (what I saw) while people's gardens near their home (the only food you could grow and keep) had plants on top of plants.  I could go on, but listen:  these are the bad guys and they are the reason that we have to do the things we do.  Although I admit we have often gone too far, we're not the bad guys here. ",

But so did china. And since then USA has been at nonstop war and nonstop installing dictators and overthrowing democracies.

Even domestically, foreigners might say china sucks but Chinese government/ccp have the highest approval ratings of any gov in the world with like 80%+, and this was done by western pew polls.\n\nUSA congress has had single digit approval for decades now.

If Russia sought to promote democracy and freedom through their interference, then there would be far less reason to be concerned about it.\n\nSecondly, in our history, the U.S. government has committed virtually every crime known to man.  If our past crimes now excuse others to commit them freely upon us, then there isn't any offense we could complain about.

They're not uniformly criminal-y. Their language allows you to change the order of the words for emphasis, so they have less emphasis when they speak. They also use more consonants, so the sounds sound a bit harsher.

That's why the US should care. You should care because if the US isn't top dog, most likely a period of instability will follow. Instability typically leads to armed conflict. \n\nWe all should care because Russia doesn't want a united West, and is acting to destabilize the West and Western alliances. They're doing this by promoting fascism and bottom feeders. Fascists and bottom feeders, historically, make life worse for everyone. Hence you should care. \n\nThat's different than the US trying to choose lesser of two evils and help stabilize regions by picking winners (through indirect influence rather than  rigging elections) who are willing to work with the US. Russia seems to want to destabilize regions and doesn't care what outcomes occur for any country, as long as Russia looks better in the process. \n\nOne reason for this is Russia is utterly fucking corrupt. The people in powerbin Russia want to corrupt others. They want to corrupt others because they are less likely to face consequences and have their assets frozen if other countries have corrupt leaders. So they find corrupt pieces of shit who sell the US down the river in a myopic greedy scheme (Flynn, stone, manafort, the Trumps).

            "This is such a bizarrely specific thing, but yes, absolutely. It's like a ritual for me. I turn out the lights and get comfy on my left side. I'll lie there for a 20-30 minutes, doze off lightly for a bit, but then I'll wake back up, roll over onto my right side, and fall asleep for real. It's so weirdly predictable; I've been wondering about it, too, since I noticed it.\n\nI suspect it may be something like... your brain adjusts to a certain pattern of actions to get ready for sleep, and that's just the last part of that pattern. Something just gets wired in where your brain goes, \"Okay, I HAVE to do this before I sleep,\" and then repetition cements it. I've heard that doing bedtime things in a particular order can help with sleep hygiene, so maybe that's kinda what this is?\n\nEdit: I wrote [an extremely tl;dr comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/illlxb/does_anybody_else_while_trying_to_fall_asleep_get/g3vcfl1?context=3) below full of Hot Sleep Tips\u2122 if you too want to be able to (maybe) fall asleep in 30 minutes or less (on a good day).

            "Yes I do this. I have to lie on my left. Trouble is if I lie like that for too long while trying to drift off I get uncomfortable again. \n\nSo I lie on my right side. Once I start to drift off I roll back and fall asleep properly.",
            "I have two pre-sleep but non-sleep positions: fetal position resting on left side of body and flat on my back.",
            "No, I get in a comfortable position then I can't fall asleep for 3 hours",
            "My \"get comfy\" position is flat down on the belly with legs straight and arms besides the body, rolled into a burrito of comfort (at least if it isn't so hot like the last weeks).\n\nThen I'll shift to the superhero with pillow under head and chest and one leg pulled up while the other one stretched out.\nI always wondered why I couldn't fall asleep lying on my back, but I took advantage of that and use it as a position for deep meditation",
            "What helps me want to get in a good sleeping position is to do a breathing exercise like breathe in for 6 seconds, breathe out for 6 seconds, and that for a minute or longer.",
            "Yeah for me it\u2019s my stomach, idk just makes me more sleepy but it also makes my back and neck ache eventually so once I\u2019m adequately sleepy I turn on my side or back",

            "lol yes all the time...",
            "Yes, I absolutely do this. But I also will wake up the next morning and whatever side I ended up on, I need to change sides. So if I'm laying on my left I flip to my right. If I don't do this I can feel it in my face and also body being \"uneven\" for hours! \n\nI call it \"evening my sides\" or sometimes \"flipping the pancake\". Yes my partner makes fun of me.",
            "100% yes. I listen to a sleep meditation or sleep story on Calm while lying on my back, and usually once it\u2019s done I am very sleepy and I move into my normal sleep position and doze off.",
            "I lay face down with my hands across my chest like a vampire in a coffin. I often can\u2019t breathe well, and my hands fall asleep but I do it every single night and I don\u2019t know why.",

I can't lie on one side of my body too long or I get a sensation like I have to move, almost like frustration or boredom, so I end up flipping back and forth until I fall asleep (like I'm trying to cook myself evenly).

            "Yes! My prep position is on my side with a body pillow. It usually doesn't last more than 20 minutes, but as soon as I get bored of that, I'll roll over onto my stomach and go straight to sleep.",

            "My fiance and i have always joked that once im on my stomach its over. I can be fully awake and then lay on my stomach and im out in less than a minute. Ive literally fallen asleep while writing texts on my stomach. But its also why i cant really sleep in a car.",

            "YES I cannot sleep on my side unless I have absolutely no room to sleep on my back or sometimes stomach, and unless I'm very tired. Still, it feels more physically comfortable so I always lie like that before I turn over.\n\nAlso, I love to cuddle my s/o in bed when going to sleep, but I will eventually push them off because I cannot deal with what has gone from comfy spooning to suffocation.",

            "Yes. Frequently lol",
            "I MUST lay on my left side for a bit first, then I turn onto my right side and fall asleep. Lolololll it\u2019s like a glitch in my programming prevents me from falling asleep any other way",

            "Absolutely. I sleep on my right side, so when I dive into bed I immediately lay on my right side. However, I simply have to turn over to my left side for a minute or or two before turning back on my right and falling asleep.",

            "Every night, almost without fail, I start on my right side for about 30 seconds to a minute. Then a move to laying on my stomach. It's fairly random what I do after that, but that beginning happens nearly every night.",
            "There is this crazy comfortable position, but overtime it stops blood from flowing to my arm so i can only give up sleeping in it",
            "All the time",
            "No. I am one of those mythical creatures that hits the pillow and I am out in like 5 mins max. I did wake up once having done a 180 and my head being at the end of the bed...that was an Interesting morning.",
            "Absolutely happens exactly like that sometimes. I love lying on my bad but unless ive been working like heavy labour i or heavy drinking i cant sleep like that",
            "All the time!",
            "We bought a new bed like three years ago, and it\u2019s a firmer mattress than I\u2019ve over had before.... wife loves it, and drops off immediately. I have developed a rotating schedule to fall asleep: I start on my left side, cuddled up to her, then feel my body relax. I then roll to my right, start to drift, then to my stomach, then to my right, then to my back, back to the left, then over to my right.... then I\u2019m finally asleep. If I break that rotation, stay too long on one side, or actually fall asleep before I get the whole ritual in, I wake up and have to start all over. I have NEVER had this problem before, and have been homeless sleeping in my truck and then in a tent, and couch surfed for a few years.",

            "Are you watching me lmao, I do this all the time",
            "Very much so!",
            "Yes! I always get comfortable on my left side and then wake myself up just enough to turn over to my right side. I thought I was just weird, lol",
            "I used to sleep in the same room as my brother, and we had a bunk bed. I would fall asleep on my right side, every night. But then, when I moved out and got my own room, I could only fall asleep on my left side. No matter how hard I tried, falling asleep on my right side was a no go.  And that\u2019s still the case today. Weird.",
            "Sometimes a few times a night",
            "No not really. I twist and turn until i do my nightly ritual. Basically i have to ask myself a question, \"how will i survive the zombie apocalypse?\" \"How would i hide it if i got given a suitcase that refills itself with untracable cash as long as i dont tell anyone?\"  \"How would i survive a group of islamists or russians taking my town or job?\" And a few more. Is this dumb? Yes. But ive been doing this for years lol.",
            "Yeah. I\u2019m like a car where I\u2019m definitely gonna turn several times before I\u2019m asleep",
            "Totally! I snore on my back and will startle myself awake several times before getting in the sweet side sleep position.",
            "Yeah I do this. I lay on my left side for a little bit while scrolling through whatever until I start dozing off, then I switch to my right side and crash.",
            "I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY PERSON WHO DID THIS",
            "Yes. If I sleep alone, I first lay on my stomach, then on my left side (but I need to start by getting on my right side and then turn all the way to the left from there). Then I may turn a bit more before sleeping but at least I know I CAN sleep now.\n\nWhen I sleep with my boyfriend it's more random !",
            "No I always get in a nice position and slowly fall asleep until it doesn't feel comfortable anymore. Then I have to change my position. The new position sucks so I do stuff with my blanket and pillow until it feels right. Sometimes I turn like maybe 3 times but most days I need at least 30mins to an hour to fall asleep. On bad days I need like 2 hours \ud83d\ude10. And in the morning I wake up like 1-2 hours before the alarm clock and just dream realls long dreams while tossing around again \ud83e\udd23. \nAnd that is the story of why I need 9-10hours in bed to hopefully get ar least the bare minimum sleep. Well and on some days I also wake up a lot in the night. I tried some things but most don't help and from one sleeping tea I hallucinated. Sleep is so fucking complicated.",
            "Every night. I have to lay on each side before switching to laying on my back to fall asleep...",
            "This but getting high",
            "I honestly prefer tight or uncomfortable positions. The harder it is to move the easier it is for me to sleep.",
            "All the time! Do other people not do this?",
            "Totally do this - feels dumb, but necessary somehow.",
            "This drives me bat shit crazy - didn't know anyone else did it too! I'll give myself a talking-to while laying in the first position knowing damn well that I will have to switch in order to sleep. Still can't stop!",
            "I\u2019ve noticed this and tried starting from the final sleeping position, but it just doesn\u2019t work for some reason.",
            "I sometimes lay face-down in a comfortable position, then, knowing I won't sleep with my limbs flexed, I start to straigthen until I flip up, relax, and sleep.\n\nMost of the time I just lay on my back and get asleep inmediatly",
            "I have the weidest way of sleeping, instead of having my head on the pillow, i lie on my stomach, with my head next to my pillow instead of on it. It's super uncomfortable if the pillow is not there but i don't actually use it when it is. i don't remember if i fall asleep like that, but i probably do.",
            "I always start off on my back just to make sure my covers are on right. Then I say my evening prayers and roll over to sleep.",
            "Getting uncomfortable is basically your body checking if you're awake. Ignore it and stay still and you'll fall asleep",
            "Wife sleeps on my left side, so I doze laying on my left, then switch to my right to fall fully asleep.\n\nWe've tried switch sides, and it reverses.",
            "Yes! For me it's about winding down. When I'm wound down I start to feel tired and roll over into my sleeping posish",
            "Omgosh are you me?",
            "No, I lie in bed thinking about how this shit belongs in /r/DoesAnybodyElse instead of here.",
            "Holy shit I literally just did this last night lol",
            "Absolutely. Every night.",
            "YES",
            "I do this ALL the time, and it\u2019s mainly when I lay down on my back. I can\u2019t fall asleep in that position\u2014I sleep on my side. I also always have one arm under my pillow, or one leg out from underneath the blanket.",
            "Left side, right side, then sort the pillow to sleep on my back. Hands over my chest like a vampire.",
            "YES!  On my back to start.  Then, when sleepy, I go to side position and I'm off to dreamland.",
            "I absolutely do this! I start on my right side, get dozey, and then when I'm about to fall asleep for good I switch to my left side lol",
            "Yes! Lay to the right, then to the left.. Then the stomach to sleep!",
            "True",
            "Yes!! I can not sleep on my side, but it\u2019s so much more comfortable to lay down on my side. So i\u2019ll do that, then roll over to my back later.",
            "I always start on my back, but then have this uncontrollable urge to turn on my side about 10 mins later despite the fact that I have never slept well on my side.",
            "that always happens to me and then i just end up switching sides on my pillow and then just fall asleep instantly hahahah",
            "Oh damn yes!!",
            "I have to lay on my left side to get sleepy, then roll over to my right side to fall asleep. Once asleep, i can roll to whatever side, but its gotta be left side/righr side first",
            "Yes!",
            "I have to lie on my left side, then my right side and then flip back over to my left side.  Every night for as long as I can remember.   I don\u2019t know why.",
            "I need to lay on my left side just long enough, then when I flip to my right I\u2019m instantly asleep. One of the main reasons I hate cuddling is because I can\u2019t do my \u201critual\u201d and end up not being able to fall asleep for hours sometimes",
            "This is an accurate description/metaphor of my life",
            "Yep! I just need to lie on my right side for a bit,.... Then the left..",
            "I do a full 360 before I fall asleep. I start on my back then half propped up onto my right shoulder, then completely onto my right shoulder, then on my belly with my hands under the pillow and my knee up, then turning and facing the other way with my knee up, then up onto my left shoulder, followed with falling asleep on my back.  \n\nIt\u2019s a pain in the ass but I feel compelled to do this to my very soul.",
            "Yup, I do this every night.  For some reason, lying on my left side is more comfortable but it's much easier for me to fall asleep on my right side.",
            "I need to roll at least 3 times for a position to an other before falling asleep",
            "Yeah. I lay on my pillow but it eventually hurts my neck. I never actually go to sleep that way. Eventually roll over and lay on my back or side.",
            "Yes! I always do that. I lay on my back and meditate until I get sleepy then turn to my right-hand side to fall asleep",
            "I thought I was the only one who did this!",
            "Yeah, every night lol",
            "I have the opposite. I remember that I forgot something and that I need to get up, and in that moment I'm more comfortable than I've ever been in my life.",
            "Piggy-backing off this (related), I can nap easily in pretty much any position. But sleep? No. What you described happens.",
            "I thought I was the only one. I have found my people.",
            "Absolutely",
            "Yes but I succeeded . I used to be attached to fetal position and it made me snort every single night . I slightly forced my self to a more relaxed one lying on my back but doing this deep breathing exercises and eventually I can fall asleep however I like",
            "Am I the only one who HAS to pee RIGHT BEFORE going to bed? It\u2019s like something psychological where if I don\u2019t pee right before, subconsciously I\u2019ll be thinking that I\u2019m gonna have to go in the middle of sleep, and just constantly thinking about it actually makes me have to pee. I think this started when one day I was tired and just dozed off in bed without planning, and then I ended having to wake up in the middle of such an amazing rest because I didn\u2019t pee that night before dozing off.",
            "Yeah, but I have this weird thing also that I lay my head on a 90\u00b0 with my body and for some reason I get sleepy faster than in a normal position, so I get that sense but it's always ruined by it",
            "I have to lay on the opposite side until my nose clears up. Then I roll to the other side for sleep. If I am not asleep by the time my nose clogs again, the cycle repeats. Miserable.",
            "YES! I have to lay on my left side, then turn to my right! If I don\u2019t fall asleep fast enough I have to do it again",
            "Yes",
            "Totally!  And if I roll over too soon into my sleeping position, I have trouble falling asleep all night!  Has to be perfectly timed.  I can tell when to roll over because I start to make snoring sounds while still awake.",
            "That's part of the sleep system I believe.  Only when very tired do we fall asleep without rolling over, you brain sends a signal to roll over to check if the rest of the brain is asleep, if it is asleep you move on to the next phase of sleep, and eventually into REM.",
            "Yeah I have to get sleepy facing away from the wall, and then roll over towards the wall once I\u2019m tired",
            "Yes, I almost always do this and I don\u2019t know why. I think part of it stems from laying in bed on my back reading or playing games all my life, and then needing to do something else to cue my body that it\u2019s time to sleep. So, gotta turn to the side.",
            "I call it the \u201cwatching anime\u201d position.",
            "Yes, most definitely. I sometimes lift one leg or arm up, so it rests on itself or the wall and it feels so comfy. But I do know I will not be abled to fall asleep like that. I usually change back to a sleep-approved position after a minute or so",
            "I have a three step process 1) on my back, but brain won\u2019t shut off, 2) left side, go to for years, but now I get heartburn if I sleep that way, 3) right side, the newly adopted position",
            "I always wake up in the most uncomfortable positions, it\u2019s awful. I can\u2019t seem to change it",
            "Yes. I can\u2019t fall asleep unless I\u2019ve been in a certain position (on my front with my knees pulled up like I\u2019m sitting cross cross but lying over my legs) but I never actually sleep in that position",
            "Ah yes. When I first lay down in bed I lie face up. I sit there, knowing I won\u2019t fall asleep unless I change positions. I want to sleep this way, but when I lie face up I just simmer in my own thoughts. So eventually I flip over, chest down, and bake on the opposite side. Only then am I metaphorically baked enough to sleep. Some times, like a grilled cheese sandwich, I must also bake my sides. So I curl up on my side, and try to sleep. That usually doesn\u2019t work tho",

            "You are asking the right question, in a way. There definitly is an argument to be made that working 40 hours and not even being able to afford a treat now and then is a scam. On the other hand, getting your coffee at a coffee shop, especially at the prices they ask, is also a scam. Getting your coffee made and to go instead of, I don't know, having a french press or V60 at home is absolutely not \"the bare minimum\" it's lifestyle flex.",
            "I always view money as number of hours worked, so if I earn $15 an hour, $15 is one hour of work.\n\nFor example if I am looking at my netflix subscription and its $10 a month, am I alright working 40 minutes for a month of netflix? Personally I think thats worth it.\n\nIMO work to live not live to work, it's absolutely ok to spend money on yourself, nobody wants to be stressed and depressed because they feel like they can't do anything and in the end it's going to catch up to you in one way or another (whether your frugality is by need or not)\n\nBut you should spend your money *wisely*, it's not a bad idea to reevaluate things and ask yourself if you could be spending that money on yourself in a better way. Maybe you should cut back on the coffee to put that money into your holiday fund, or maybe cancel that netflix subscription and get out more and be more active. Theres no right or wrong answer, just what you belive is the best way to spend your money on you.",
            "When people are advises to stop drinking coffee to save money, the coffee is not the issue.\n\nThe real points are:\n\n* Audit your daily/weekly/monthly expenditure.\n   * What is essential, establish your core cost of living.\n   * Educate youself on the cost of your unconcious habit driven purchases.\n   * Monitor/Reduce spending on non-essentials.\n* Habit is powerful and often costly.\n* We have big blind spots about the real costs of our lifestyle choices.\n\nIt's not about living an austere life, it's about understanding you spending decisions.\n\nFor Example: \n\nIn my case, I was completly blind about how much I was spending on my 2 dogs.  It came as a shock that we were spending more on our dogs than on vacations :-) We adjusted some of the more lavish grooming and discretionary spending choices. But of course we did not get rid of the dogs or start feeding them poor quality food :-) \n\nI was also paying for 3 different movies streaming services + cable channels. Our kids have largly stopped watching movies at home as they got older, so we discussed and eliminated the movie channels and streaming services and added the F1 sports channel instead. \n\nOverall across a number of costs we saved 250 Euro a month and increased our vacation savings to create more family memories each year. So for us ausiting spending redirected our spending to match activities we value more rather than reducing it dramatically.",
            "I used to buy coffee on the way to work most days. I quit when COVID hit and now make my own that is basically equivalent. \n\nSo in the end I get coffee of less consistent quality and have saved a few bucks that have not brought me a new house or car.",
            "It's not usually literal. But instead it's usually aimed towards people living paycheque to paycheque with an inability to save money, and very little protection in the event of an emergency - with the emphasis being *\"you gotta start somewhere\"*.\n\n>\"don't buy coffee outside\" or \"cancel that subscription\" etc **to be in a better financial situation** but it always has me wondering\n\nIt's very obvious that this is emphasising how to ***get out*** of financial trouble - and so no, it's not suggesting you do this for the rest of your life. Not sure why OP's construed this to therefore mean *\"keep doing this for the rest of your life\"*.\n\n>Why shouldn't the average person be able to buy a latte when they feel like it? Or watch a movie on Netflix after a long day?\n\nIf you're asking this then, whatever the situation, you haven't hit rock bottom. The advice you're seeing is what you can do now to save up, whilst you still have some flexibility.\n\nBecause trust me - if you get laid off from work and so are a couple of paycheques away from being homeless, lattes and Netflix are going to be the last thing on your mind.\n\nPersonally, I think the better method of getting into a better financial situation is to work on upping your income. But since that will most likely lead to lifestyle creep, the negative financial habits one may have may therefore risk continuing.\n\nAlso - despite what I said before about priorities, I think \"paying yourself\" via putting a regular amount of your paycheque into a savings account is the best way of bettering yourself financially. If you then feel you can afford lattes, or alternatively end up having to drastically cut down on spending, at least you're moving in the right direction.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne more thing, regarding \"why shouldn't we be able to spend on XYZ?\".... it's your life and your decisions. The advice you're getting may be the result of you yourself seeking advice on improving your financial situation, owing to your own expressions of having exhausted all your options. People are trying to help.... but ultimately aren't affected by your struggles. So feel free to ignore them.",
            "Could be because what you define as \"bare minimum\" is, in fact, a luxury.  \n\nThere are plenty of us that have grown up watching television with antenna TV.  The very concept of paying for any sort of \"extra\" on top of that, whether it was cable (in the age before streaming) or streaming services (today) was when you had spare money to spend for that luxury.\n\nSame with paying for a five-plus-dollar cup of coffee.  This is not a necessity.  It is not a \"bare minimum\" of living.  It is an extra luxury that you can afford when you have money to pay for it.    \n  \nDoes that mean you should give up all the little luxuries in life?  Absolutely not.  If you have the money to afford to spend on a fast food meal you crave, then do it.  If have money in your budget to afford that spicy ice cream treat while you are out, then do it.  Without the little luxuries, as you said, what's the point of it all?  But it is not a \"bare minimum\" - that would be a \"bare minimum plus luxuries\", and if your budget is able to afford that, then go for it.",
            "If you *can* afford it, great.  It's a question of whether you are working to service debt or not.  If you have no debt, a coffee out a day is fine. \n\nBut if you \"treat\" yourself every day when you are struggling with other bills you need to evaluate priorities.  If coffee still wins, at least you understand why you are where you are financially.",

Knowing that you have a financial pillow to land on, if you fall, takes away lots of stress.",
            "My take on this is that it is emphasizing on not spending on things not necessary or not spend extra on that.\n\nCancel Netflix etc, spend time reading books borrowed from library or watch youtube or free to air TV.\n\nDon't buy coffee outside is a bit different. Don't buy too many coffee outside. If you socialise over coffee with people then money well spent, but if you are just grabbing a Starbucks on the way to work then that is a waste of money. You could have made a better cup of coffee for less at home before you leave. \n\nGo with cheaper mobile plans, you don't need the latest iPhone with the top plans and then paying extra for phone repayments. Get a decent phone and get a plan that you can live with. 20-30gb a month is plenty, you do not need unlimited that cost 3 times more.\n\nAnd make your own lunch rather than eat out everyday. But the occasional eating out is fine.\n\nSo these advices are not that you don't spend at all, just need to curb the unnecessary ones. There are a lot of things that can be enjoyed without spending much money.",
            "The point of the \u2018cancel Netflix\u2019 thing isn\u2019t to literally say the ticket to wealth is not eating out, but it\u2019s to exercise control and take accountability for your finances and live within your means.\n\nBesides, it does absolutely add up. I\u2019ve seen people spend literally thousands of dollars a month on DoorDash.",
            "Treating yourself is one thing.  Buying a $5 coffee everyday works out to the cost of a small vacation every year.  Buying lattes everyday day is not the bare minimum, being able to afford coffee in your home is the bare minimum.  If you chose to blow your allotment of comfort items on lattes and Netflix, that is completely fine.  You can't also be upset that others used that money for a weekend cruise, or a car payment.  You don't get lattes, vacations, cars, subscription services, nice clothes, dining out, a new phone, etc   You pick which of those buckets is most important to you and use your discretionary income on that.  Remember, all those things require someone else's time and energy.",
            "It\u2019s a question of choices.\n\nChoices have consequences.\n\nIf you spend 100 dollars on a coffee a week, you have 100 less dollars per week to spend elsewhere, such as to invest or whatever, but you get to enjoy that experience of having those coffees etc\n\nIf you choose to go without, you have an extra 100 dollars a week that can be invested or spent elsewhere, but you miss out on the experience of having those coffees.\n\nThe question is what matters more to you, a stronger financial situation in the long term, or enjoying those experiences in the short and medium term.\n\nThere\u2019s no right answer. There\u2019s no one size fits all. \n\nIt\u2019s just a question of what matters more to you personally, and accepting that you can\u2019t have your cake and eat it too.\n\n\nIn exactly the same way you can\u2019t eat whatever you\u2019d like, and be in amazing shape.\n\nSo which matters more to you?

            "Part of this is realizing you've been conned by marketing teams into thinking that buying shit is treating yourself. \n\nMy wife and I learned to make our own luxury coffee at home, and we found the perfect recipe, so that we like it better than anything we can buy on the road.  \n\nWe feel like we're treating ourselves every morning.

Sadly, mass societal change is needed to get to the point where people can afford to live and actually have a life at the same time.",
            "When you hear stuff like this, it's because people often live in various amounts of extremes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know multiple people who have Netflix and Hulu, and barely watch either of those.  I know multiple people who complain about the cost of food, and they get doordash or uber eats 10+ times a month.  I know plenty of people that complain about the cost of vehicle, and they're driving a 2-3 year old car with 'the works' and have a $900+ a month car payment for a car they put less than 200 miles on a month.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlmost no one has an issue with \"treating yourself\" every now and then, but even the OP goes into the fallacy of stating why shouldn't people by a latte when they feel like it.  For some people, that's one starbucks run a week or month, for a lot of others thats a daily run to starbucks and a $15 coffee and bagel when they can get the same thing with a toaster and coffee pot for about $2 a day.",
            "One thing my wife had to learn when we first got married was that we could not love like her parents. Her parent where near the end of their careers and making good money so they were able to eat out, go on vacation, and buy expensive toys fairy often. \n\nOn the flip side, we were both in school, hadn\u2019t started our careers yet, and were barely scraping by. \n\nI think people often forget that their parents spent the last 30 years getting to where they are at now. Instead, they think they should be able to do everything their 50 year old parents can do. But their parents had to get there the hard way. Hard work, sustained effort over a long period of time, and a lot of going without. Only after all that hard work did they get to where they are at now. \n\nSo yeah, when young and at the beginning of your career, you probably won\u2019t be able to afford much. And that\u2019s ok. It\u2019s normal to scrip and scrape and save through that period of life. It\u2019s good for you. It builds character. \n\nAnd if you are careful with that process through good financial habits, you can get to the point where living life the way you want isn\u2019t that much of a big deal anymore and you will find you can liver very comfortably within your means. \n\nThe process just takes time, determination, commitment, and hard work.",

            "Here's a slightly different take that I haven't seen in the top comments (my apologies if it's further down): it's about making sure that your spending aligns with your values and you aren't just frittering your money away. Many people can afford some luxuries but not ALL the luxuries. Do you genuinely enjoy that coffee, or is it just out of habit? If you really do enjoy it and would miss it, can you scale it back to 1-2 times a week instead of every day? Are you frequently using that Netflix subscription/gym membership/etc., or are you paying for something you don't really use? If you stop spending money on little things that don't bring you joy or add value to your life, you'll have more for the things that do.\n\nOf course, that's not advice for people who can only afford the bare necessities (or not even that), but they're  probably not out there queuing up at Starbucks every day.",

            "The sentiment of these statements is not don't ever indulge yourself or enjoy things, it is to practice restraint and be comfortable saying no to cheapy and easy impulses. When you get into the habit of succumbing to every little craving you really do build up big financial impact (and imo unhappiness impact) on your life by a thousand cuts.\n\nYes, assholes sometimes say this to make it seem like all you need to succeed in life or get out of poverty is practice restraint. Especially ironic coming from assholes who are wealthy enough that eating out every day is just a rounding error. But there is truth that people who are incapable of really ever saying \"no\" to buying a coffee when they can easily make at home or pack their lunch struggle with finances a lot more than those who can. They always seem to be \"kicked down\" by the system, always behind. \n\nI think it's more than just a financial problem but a psychological one too. Cultivating a sense of restraint in your psychology has big benefits beyond just money. There's a reason gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins. Every single person I've known who I'd describe as \"having their shit together\" through every income bracket is because they're good at cultivating this. They spend, eat and enjoy themselves **with intention** and not just mindlessly. That intentionality then turns into a life full of critical thinking that avoids them falling into addiction or spending traps, which means they're not going broke or being whittled down as much as others.\n\nThat's what the entire point of this statement is supposed to mean. It's not a serious expectation that saving $5 today on coffee will seriously transform your life financially, and that you're just supposed to suffer. It's saying that being intentional and mindful with your spending and practicing a mindset of restraint can add up to being transformative - not just money wise but also life satisfaction wise. It's specifically targeting people who truly struggle with this and who are addicted to cheap easy to buy thrills to find joy in life. Trust me, there's a LOT of people who do not have restraint on spending money in this way. Enjoy eating out, buying a coffee, whatever.

            "The \"coffee\" / \"avocado\" thing has been memed and blown out of proportion. There most *definitely* are people who are skint because they spend money on frivolous shit. What's counted as \"frivolous\" may be different from person to person, but you need to cut your cloth to your pattern. One or two coffees or meals out shouldn't break the bank, but if you cant afford it, you can't afford it! If you're buying a coffee EVERY single day it's 365 coffees a year. Where i live that would be about \u00a31000-ish a year on coffee. If you're on minimum wage, that's 1/20th of your wage.",

It's food and a bed. $15/hr you clear about $2000/mnth which is plenty if beans, rice with a $1000/mnth room rental and toiletries and clothing.

Even if it weren't for #1, people tend to spend money when they have it on things they don't need. Buying a $5 coffee every day adds up, compared to making coffee at home. I don't drink a lot of alcohol for example, so I save a ton of money compared to people that drink a lot. Changing your habits can make a big difference. But not as big a difference as making more money\n3. Even if you make a lot of money, focusing on #2 gets your impulses under control. A lot of people try to cope with their emotions by buying crap. If you reaction to boredom, or any sort of lull in your emotions, is to spend money on junk, then not only will you have less money, but you aren't addressing the root of your problems.

I think the main mistake people make is to spend \\_everything\\_ every month.\n\nI look back on my last 17 years of being an adult and I KNOW I could have saved 50 quid a month over that time, on average at least, without really missing out on anything. Be it parking fines, purchases I didn't need etc. The ROI on that money would have been worth more than the value I got from it at the time.\n\nHowever, I also spent money on holidays, skydiving courses, nights out with friends etc that I will never regret.\n\ntldr: Consider the value of a coffee every day from a shop, vs the value of a coffee from your own coffee machine, and the \"reward\" is basically the same. The opportunity cost of being lazy though is decades of compound returns on an investment you could have made instead.",

            "It\u2019s not about that. It\u2019s about building a nice safety net so that you can retire and live comfortably from 65 til death. Would you rather have a latte at Starbucks or work into your late 70s?",
            "If you can\u2019t make more money then the only option is to cut out things you enjoy. For many of people there\u2019s A LOT they could cut out to save money, for many there isn\u2019t much. \n\nIf you\u2019re asking if life of trying to save money sucks, yes it does. \n\nBut the idea of saving small amounts over time really does make a difference and you can usually do that without sacrificing quality of life in most cases. If you want to save money without more income then you really have no other choice.\n\nAn important note: When people say this they don\u2019t mean to never spend any money on anything nice ever, they mean don\u2019t spend money mindlessly every single day. Taking the coffee for example, you can have a nice americano at an espresso cafe once every few days, but if you\u2019re buying 2 shitty coffees every day from a chain coffee shop for $3 each it\u2019ll add up.  It\u2019s mindless spending on something that doesn\u2019t make you any happier than just making the coffee yourself.  Another example is make lunches at home rather than eating some subpar fast food/cafeteria food for $12. Eating out may be easier but you could make much better and healthier food for far cheaper at home. \n\nIf you look at your debit/credit spending for one week and can\u2019t remember how you just spent $80, it\u2019s likely you can cut out some random small purchases that are unnecessary. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to cut out things that make you happy but most people can definitely cut out mindless purchasing that they won\u2019t remember they even made the next day.\n\nFrom a wider perspective the \u201cbare minimum\u201d of many people is considered a luxury to many other people in the world. Buying a coffee from Starbucks every day may make you happy for 2 minutes but to pretend that you NEED a Starbucks to have enjoyment in your life shows there\u2019s a deeper issue than your spending habits.  You shouldn\u2019t have to purchase nice things for yourself every single day to find enjoyment.\n\nSo to some extent in many cases, people who say \u201cjust spend less on coffee\u201d are correct. It won\u2019t make people a millionaire suddenly, and many already *dont* spend money on themselves, but it\u2019s a bit silly to say that it\u2019s stupid advice when the majority do indeed spend more than they have to to have the bare essentials. \n\nI spent $1.50 on a coffee 2x a day for a year at a really shitty coffee chain that tasted like sink water. That never made me happy, but it cost me $1100.  Let alone the breakfast wraps a couple times a week that cost $5 which tasted like they were kept in a freezer since 1980.",

            "The idea of what \"bare minimum\" means to most people is always getting higher. What sane person thinks they should be able to go to Starbucks once a week. Starbucks is a company designed to take as much money from you as possible and give you the least in return. Redefine what bare minimum means and then you will be happy.

            "After owing a business where there\u2019s kind of a cap on income, you learn that it\u2019s not how much you make, but how much you keep. What this means in terms of a small business is that you can buy a new computer when you need one, or figure out how to maximize its potential, maybe just upgrade the RAM. It\u2019s about looking at a problem and figuring out how to get what you need without spending more money unless it\u2019s completely necessary. \n\nSo, translating that into 9-5 workers. What it means to me is it\u2019s likely your income is fixed. You don\u2019t have an adjustable income. For me, I can\u2019t get overtime. There\u2019s nothing I can really do to change my income stream within the confines of my job. But, I can critically review my spending and cut out things I don\u2019t really need. Occasionally, I might find a subscription that I thought I cancelled still hitting my account. Or, maybe when looking at things, I notice that I\u2019m having 3 Starbucks lattes a day. Maybe I\u2019ll have just one. I don\u2019t think it means strip your life down to no happiness. It means just look at your spending and think about if you really need that thing or not. \n\nIt\u2019s a good exercise to go through. All you can really do is manage your spending. That\u2019s why it important to look there. If you have other sources of income, exploit those. But, most of us just have our job. So, there are no other options than reduce spending.",

You can literally go buy the same thing off the shelves for half the price and have at it home. \n\nSame thing on the internet. Every social media site visit and google search is trying to sell you shit that you didn't plan on buying. I know most people think \"oh that doesn't work on me\", but it really does. The point is that it becomes white noise, and you become acclimated to it before you finally find yourself in a position where you want to buy it.\n\nThat doesn't mean you can't go to a favorite coffee shop on Saturday morning and enjoy it. It also doesn't mean you can't have hobbies. Just be intentional, because if you're not deciding these things for yourself, marketing professionals are happy to do it for you.",

I came up from some pretty destitute beginnings. And I'm going to tell you right now if you throw a considerable amount of your money at random BS that you don't need, that's really going to eat into your ability to find upward mobility.\n\nIf you are at all worried about credit cards with interest or personal loans or anything like that, and you're going out and eating at McDonald's instead of bringing lunch to work? That's part of the problem. If you can take even $50 a month and throw it at a bill instead of spending it on frivolous stuff, that's a much better financial situation to be in.\n\nHaving a ton of subscriptions and going out for expensive overpriced terrible coffee is not something someone in a bad financial situation should be doing. Get a library card. Read some books. Check out free movies. Watch countless shows on YouTube or some other free platform instead of having a Netflix subscription. If you play video games get something like Xbox game pass and play tons of games for not very much instead of buying a bunch of new titles.\n\nWages absolutely need to be higher. But you also have to work with what you have. It's okay to have a luxury here and there, but the number of people that overdo it and then shrug and say well there's no hope and there's no point in not spending money irresponsibly are deluding themselves.\n\nNow if you use but pay off your credit cards every month and never have to worry about paying your bills and all that? Do whatever you want. Spend $1,000 a month on a mobile game. Drink nothing but starbucks. Do whatever you want.  Buy weed brownies. Whatever tickles your fancy. Because at that point you're just spending luxury money.\n\nBut if you don't have luxury money in the first place and you're subscribed for 10 different things and you're eating fast food on a semi regular basis, it's hard to feel sympathetic about someone's financial situation when they're flushing a considerable amount of money down the toilet every month.\n\nOf course let us not forget that you also need to be investing for retirement at the same time. By the time you're 30 it's almost critical that you've already been establishing a plan and investing money towards that or else there's a high chance you're going to be pretty screwed later on.

It's usually misinterpreted or mis-said by people who don't know what the original was trying to say.\n\nthe other big issue is that it is said to people when the luxuries aren't the issue, but rather their wage and SOL aren't compatible.\n\nFor example, my friend gets door dash nearly every day, sometimes twice. and while he is stable enough to be able to do that, he still spends 3-5 bucks each time on fees and tips. that's $150 a month that he is paying for the minor luxury of not driving to get food. to him, it is worth it, but i disagree. As i have things I'd need or rather spend that money on.\n\ngetting a treat or luxury isn't a problem, but if you are getting multiple luxuries all the time, there may be an issue. of course, cutting out Starbucks isn't going to help you make rent or car payments, but it can give you a bit of cash to spend in places that it's needed.",

You'll probably have to change jobs, learn new skills, practice interviewing, get a second job, etc, and many factors may increase the difficulty of this, such as already being stretched thin financially.\n\nSpending less on the other hand is often possible.  There's some amount of expenses you'll obviously need to spend, but beyond that, if you're in the position where you can buy daily lattes, subscribe to streaming services etc. then there are some expenses you \\_could\\_ cut back or at least consider if they're worth the expense to you.\n\nThat daily latte will cost $1500 / year.  A streaming subscription can cost $100-200 per year for each subscription.  A BMW costs twice as much as a honda, etc.\n\nAre these costs worth it to you?  If the answer is \"yes\", that's fine - you might be able to cut costs without even giving them up by choosing a cheaper coffee, brewing one before you leave, or rotating your streaming services instead of subscribing to multiple at a time.\n\nOften times, just having a little bit of cash on hand can be cheaper in the long run, so cutting expenses doesn't have to be permanent.  Having a few thousand in the bank might prevent having to take a loan for an unexpected expense, being able to buy the same necessities in bulk for a cheaper price-per-item, being able to put a down payment on a more reliable car, or moving to an area with a lower cost-of-living.\n\nIf you're happy with or not looking to improve your financial situation, that's fine too; but it's not going to get better on it's own without taking some sort of action if you're looking to change it.",

And you could take back up to $7,000 per year that you pay to the IRS (and which Congress just hands over to the petroleum, defense and banking industries) with nothing to show for it, and use that money that you would have otherwise just LOST to invest in the petroleum, defense, and banking industries yourself, so that every time the Congress passes a budget that puts the country another trillion dollars in debt just so they can pay Halliburton for a no-bid contract and buy missiles and fighter jets from Raytheon and Lockheed to protect the interests of the petroleum industry and the Federal Reserve's interest in the U.S. Dollar as the world's reserve currency thanks to all those guns and missiles and jets persuading all the OPEC nations to keep invoicing their global oil sales in U.S. Dollars (in exchange for a favorable agreement to purchase U.S. Treasuries before they go to auction) then YOU will profit from every one of those transactions, UNLIKE all those suckers who just bought lattes with their extra change and now even have to pay twice as much for them as they did two or three years ago because the Federal Reserve had to authorize the U.S. Treasury to print another 10 trillion Dollars so it could pay YOU! Then the \"Federal\" Reserve (private banks!) gets to decide how much the Treasury has to pay again YOU (and the Saudis) for the privilege of printing those dollars that provide less \"treats\" for the average consumer, but much higher returns for investors. \n\nIf you really wanted to \"treat\" yourself, you would use every Dollar you could get your hands on to invest in shares of a broad market index like the Russell 2000 or the S&P 500. Those who do are playing the game the way it is designed to be played by the corporate owners of this country and the world. Those who don't are just turning tricks for a pimp. If you're a good little ho' and bring him all his money then he might even let you have a latte and watch a short movie on Netflix.",

A while back I did some research in US census records, and I was astounded at how many people had labor-intensive jobs. Most people were farmers, or sailors, or teamsters, etc. There were very few cushy jobs. People worked hard. They were tired at the end of the day. Then they went to bed, woke up the next day, and did it all over again. Hard work has been the human condition since the beginning of time. \n\nHow do people survive a life of work? They take pride and satisfaction in the work itself. They get enjoyment from friends and family. They believe that there is more to life than being able to afford a daily latte, whether they can afford a daily latte habit or not. \n\nSo get used to the idea that you need to work, and figure out your why. What is important to you? What do you want out of life? Is a daily latte helping you get there or not?",

Including the ability to afford a home and a car and a vacation while supporting a family of four on a single salary.\n\nFor this to happen we a) need legislation and b) need strong unions. and possibly c) need to tax people earning more than about half a million bucks a year fairly high. Like it was last time we had a thriving middle class and did things like break scientific barriers by landing on the moon. \n\nUnfortunately all the things the government did to support all of these options are no longer popular politically because of citizens united basically tanking the representation of anyone who can't afford their own Super PAC.",

Like, brewing decent coffee at home in a thermos to take to work with you is pretty comparable to buying coffee but saves you a couple hundred a year. If you have 5 tv subscriptions but normally only use 3, could you do without paying for 2 for another couple hundred a year. It\u2019s about living within your means. Capitalism has gotten a lot of people to a point where they believe that because they don\u2019t have X or Y that they\u2019re behind or missing out but the reality is that no one cares what brand your T-shirt comes from. Many people convince themselves to get the pro iPhone when really a normal iPhone would do just fine. You still have an iPhone at the end of the day and you won\u2019t notice a meaningful difference but you saved 500 bucks\u2026 these 3 small changes could save you over $1000 per year and they\u2019re relatively low effort and not impactful to many peoples lives.\n\nAs I get older I balk at the idea of buying drinks at a bar or coffee at a coffee shop because it\u2019s frankly fuckin expensive.

            "Eating out less, ordering less takeout, and skipping expensive coffee runs saves an insane amount of money. It really makes a difference when you live paycheck to paycheck. I am the only income for a family of 4 in Los Angeles with no savings and it\u2019s the first thing we cut when money gets tight. \n\nI would love to make more money, always. But life doesn\u2019t owe me a latte, a double cheeseburger from Shake Shack, or a monthly subscription to Cruchyroll. Being denied these pleasures is not inhumane. Joy and happiness comes on other forms as well. Sometimes you gotta cut back to live within your means. It\u2019s just fucking reality.",

But moderate it because you should also be saving\n\nThis is how life has always been. It's just that honestly younger people (I'm one myself in this context) have been overindulged and have never really learned delayed gratification. \n\nIt's a balance. It doesn't mean you can never have a treat or indulgence. But you also save for the future.",

            "Imo I consider buying coffee outside at a Cafe like ordering delivery through Uber eats or grubhub. Just add all this extra cost on top of labor cost for the brand.\n\nI started buying my own coffee beans and grinding it myself and brewing it. I'm having thr best coffee I ever had for cheaper than thr cheapest dunkin donuts coffee. Buying coffee every day I'm at work from Starbucks would cost at least 25 bucks. Double if I need two cups. I usually need two cups.\n\nSo if you truly do wish to treat yourself, try brewing your own coffee. You'll save money in the long run doing it. Ofc the initial expenses will be a lot of you wish to do it right. The cheaper it is, the more labor intensive it is for you. Aka cheap.manual grinder as opposed to baratza encore. But you really can't go wrong with French press.",
            "You get to treat yourself to pleasantries from disposable income, not \"bill money\". \n\nMake a budget starting with your absolute, bare necessities. This should be like... car insurance / car payment, rent, utilities, bare-bones rice & beans diet. See how much money that is. \n\nIf there's money left, your phone is probably next, along with internet. \n\nStill have money? Add in a more diverse diet, from the grocery store, not restaurants.\n\nKeep doing this, adding in \"luxuries\" until your budget is consumed. Your goal is to eventually earn enough that funding your 401k is a higher priority to you than your next luxury. For me, my 401k was more important to me than streaming services, a gym membership, any non-homemade food, etc.\n\nThe hard part of all this is that little devil on your shoulder called \"credit\". If something doesn't fit into your budget now, then it doesn't fit into your budget inside the next 30 days. If you don't pay it in the next 30 days, then suddenly the item gets more expensive again, in the form of interest. \n\nFor a larger purchase that doesn't fit into a weekly / monthly budget, the best way is to climb a few rungs down your luxury ladder, and put that money aside until you can buy your larger purchase.",
            "The \"don't buy coffee outside\" and \"cancel that subscription\" is advice given to people who are drowning in debt and trying to find their way out.  Also, it's for people who have zero savings or no emergency fund or retirement account.  These little purchases add up.  Once you have your financial house in order, by all means, buy coffee, get as many subscriptions as your heart desires.  The money spent on coffee, eating out, subscriptions can be used to pay off consumer debt.  If this doesn't apply to you, let it fly.\n\nAlso, food, shelter and clothing are bare minimums.

            "I'm sure we've all seen those crazy budgeting schemes that have been circulated for people on low incomes, and they're always wildly insulting. Even if you eat very, very cheaply (something I've done), don't splurge, AND magically have 100% reliable transportation and a clean bill of health, it still never accounts for one-time expenses that eventually have to happen. Things like... a snow shovel, or winter gloves, or a vacuum cleaner. And god forbid you have a hobby (something to do while you're sitting in your spartan, avocado-toastless one bedroom apartment), which will also have upkeep costs. Yarn, paint supplies, guitar strings, whatever.\n\nI will say that there are ways to mitigate excessive costs on things that could be made or done at home. I personally like beer, and if the budget is tight, then I'll enjoy delicious beer at home instead of going out. However, I should still be able to afford to go out, socialize, and enjoy delicious beer every now and then.",

But we can't all be wealthy enough to afford luxuries if the top keep hoarding profits and not letting it trickle down. Money to the top 1% is just a game, like the money isn't money anymore, just points. \"Look how many points I scored whilst shafting the peasants.\" I often wonder what would happen if every person gave all their money to the top 10 wealthiest people so there was no more money to get. What would they do then?! Maybe that's the goal? suck up all the material wealth so the only thing left is a bank of time that lets us eat just enough to keep us in working condition but hungry enough to return.

            "It used to be different.  I remember it, although I was just a kid then.  But the [FCC Fairness Doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCC_fairness_doctrine) was eliminated in 1987.\n\n>On August 5, 1987, under FCC Chairman Dennis R. Patrick, the FCC abolished the doctrine by a 4\u20130 vote, in the Syracuse Peace Council decision, which was upheld by a panel of the Appeals Court for the D.C. Circuit in February 1989, though the Court stated in their decision that they made \"that determination without reaching the constitutional issue.\"\n>\n>The FCC vote was opposed by members of Congress who said the FCC had tried to \"flout the will of Congress\" and the decision was \"wrongheaded, misguided and illogical.\". The decision drew political fire, and cooperation with Congress was one issue.  In June 1987, Congress attempted to preempt the FCC decision and codify the Fairness Doctrine, but the legislation was vetoed by President Ronald Reagan. Another attempt to revive the doctrine in 1991 was stopped when President George H.W. Bush threatened another veto.\n\nCoincidentally, 1987 was the year that Fox Network went prime.  It was the same year Married With Children, The Simpsons, (both Fox shows) and similar shows subverted the then-standard wholesome family sitcom.  It was the year before Rush Limbaugh became nationally syndicated.  Just shortly before 'shock media' became a big thing on TV with shows like Jerry Springer.\n\nIt was also right around the time when cable TV became very common.  When suddenly there were hundreds of 24-hour stations to fill with content, instead of just 3 or 4 broadcast stations that went off the air at night and maybe one or two syndicated stations.\n\nThe reason our news is the way it is now is very closely related to the rise of Fox, Cable, and Republican influence.  It's not an accident.",

            "Depends on the format of the show that you're watching. Some shows are set up like news programs, but they aren't actually news programs; they are commentary programs. They may have a news desk and interview people, but since they are giving commentary, they aren't actually objective news presenters.\n\nWhen you have a straight news program (especially local news), an anchor may have light commentary without revealing their personal political point-of-view as a method of trying to connect with an audience. They want the audience to feel the news personality is part of their family and willing to watch every broadcast. If an anchor is purely stating the news, they may feel cold and unapproachable. In the US, most broadcast news outlets are for-profit, and even though news is offered as a \"public service\" (specifically local, over the air stations which are licensed by the US Federal government to use the frequency) as a requirement to be licensed, news programming is a major revenue source and they need to attract as large of an audience as possible. Even non-profit sources need to attract a large audience in order to be able to get more donations so the also need to attract an audience.\n\nAnd the programming the gets the best ratings are usually due, not to their content, but due to the personalities presenting the content.

Normal banter where they factually discuss a topic without extreme opinions is very rare, but also pretty refreshing. It also doesn\u2019t help that when it gets to political topics, a lot of the time details are just straight up omitted at times to guide the audience to seeing their side while being discreet. I remember hearing something about how they tazed a black girl or something and trying to get mad at police for that, but when I looked it up I read further that it was because she was trying to STAB SOMEONE.

They are talking about current events and asking what they mean, how they might affect our lives, what will happen next, etc. Often, the subject of discussion for a particular show on a particular day is determined in advance and they aren\u2019t reporting \u201cbreaking news\u201d that you\u2019ve never heard before.\n\nThere are also network news shows, usually late afternoon or evening, that tend to be more neutral, at least traditionally. They generally have a single anchor, so there obviously isn\u2019t any discussion. Those shows pretty much just report events. I haven\u2019t seen any of the network news shows in a long time, so maybe they have become more like cable news in order to fight for ratings.\n\nMedium to large cities have their own, locally produced news shows that tend to be more dry. The first segment is usually just reporting events with no opinion or discussion. They often start with local stories because that\u2019s what people watch the local news for. They mention national and world news, but they don\u2019t have a worldwide or even nationwide team of reporters, so they are just reporting pretty basic facts. Any opinions expressed tend to be light discussion about local events and usually are not very controversial.

I saw this one clip of a guy from Fox News going to Chinatown and just harassing the elderly, asking them why they can't speak English etc. I think that if people are going to give their opinion, they can at least be nice and not be a racist asshole.",
            "That is called \"opinion reporting\" aka FOX News. No lie, their biggest news personalities from 1-5 are all \"opinion reporters\" not journalists. Yet millions of people take their word as gospel.",

I am a conservative and cant even watch FOX or News Max because all they report is there own agenda on hating liberals and Biden. Its so annoying. I want to watch the news to see what is happening in the world not your personal opinion. Trump lost and Biden won thats the fact so stop talking about how much you hate trump and move on. To be honest the reason trump lost is because all those republicans and conservatives sat on their ass and didnt vote they assumed he would win...
