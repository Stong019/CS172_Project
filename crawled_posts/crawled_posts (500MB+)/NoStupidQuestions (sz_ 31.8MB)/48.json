If deceptions about terrorism go unchallenged, then the threat will continue until it destroys us.\n\n>The truth is that none of our thousands of nuclear weapons can protect us from these threats. No Star Wars system -- no matter how technically advanced, no matter how many trillions of dollars are poured into it -- can protect us from a nuclear weapon delivered in a sailboat or a Cessna or a suitcase or a Ryder rental truck. Not one weapon in our vast arsenal, not a penny of the $270 billion a year we spend on so-called defense can defend against a terrorist bomb. That is a military fact.\n\n>As a retired lieutenant colonel and a frequent lecturer on national security issues, I have often quoted Psalm 33: \u201cA king is not saved by his mighty army. A warrior is not saved by his great strength.\u201d The obvious reaction is, \u201cThen what can we do? Is there nothing we can do to provide security for our people?\u201d\n\n>There is. But to understand it requires that we know the truth about the threat. Mr. President, you did not tell the American people the truth about why we are the targets of terrorism when you explained why we bombed Afghanistan and Sudan. You said that we are a target because we stand for democracy, freedom and human rights in the world. Nonsense!\n\n>We are the target of terrorists because, in much of the world, our government stands for dictatorship, bondage and human exploitation. We are the target of terrorists because we are hated. And we are hated because our government has done hateful things.\n\n>In how many countries have agents of our government deposed popularly elected leaders and replaced them with puppet military dictators who were willing to sell out their own people to American multinational corporations?\n\n>We did it in Iran when the U.S. Marines and the CIA deposed Mossadegh because he wanted to nationalize the oil industry. We replaced him with the Shah and armed, trained and paid his hated Savak national guard, which enslaved and brutalized the people of Iran -- all to protect the financial interests of our oil companies. Is it any wonder that there are people in Iran who hate us?\n\n>We did it in Chile. We did it in Vietnam. More recently, we tried to do it in Iraq.\n\n>And, of course, how many times have we done it in Nicaragua and all the other banana republics of Latin America? Time after time we have ousted popular leaders who wanted the riches of the land to be shared by the people who worked it. We replaced them with murderous tyrants who would sell out their own people so the wealth of the land could be taken out by the likes of Domino Sugar, the United Fruit Company, Folgers and Chiquita Banana.\n\n>In country after country, our government has thwarted democracy, stifled freedom and trampled human rights. That\u2019s why it is hated around the world. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re the target of terrorists.\n\n>People in Canada enjoy democracy, freedom and human rights. So do the people of Norway and Sweden. Have you heard of Canadian embassies being bombed? Or Norwegian, or Swedish?\n\n>We are not hated because we practice democracy, freedom and human rights. We are hated because our government denies these things to people in Third World countries whose resources are coveted by our multinational corporations. That hatred we have sown has come back to haunt us in the form of terrorism -- and in the future, nuclear terrorism.\n\n>Once the truth about why the threat exists is understood, the solution becomes obvious. We must change our ways. Getting rid of our nuclear weapons -- unilaterally if necessary -- will enhance our security. Drastically altering our foreign policy will ensure it.\n\n>Instead of sending our sons and daughters around the world to kill Arabs so we can have the oil under their sand, we should send them to rebuild their infrastructure, supply clean water and feed starving children. Instead of continuing to kill thousands of Iraqi children every day with our sanctions, we should help Iraqis rebuild their electric power plants, their water treatment facilities, their hospitals -- all the things we destroyed and prevented them from rebuilding with sanctions.\n\n>Instead of training terrorists and death squads, we should close the School of the Americas. Instead of supporting insurrection, destabilization, assassination and terror around the world, we should abolish the CIA and give the money to relief agencies.\n\n>In short, we should do good instead of evil. Who would try to stop us? Who would hate us? Who would want to bomb us?\n\n>That is the truth, Mr. President.

There was also a problem of Chinese Muslims going to Afghanistan or Syria as Mujahedeen and coming back radicalized and trained.  China's crackdown in Xinxiang is rooted in counterterrorism.  Most of the efforts are focused on deradicalization by teaching language and trade skills. That's not to say there isn't valid criticism of Chinese deradicalization programs, but they didn't come out of some smoke filled room where a bunch of communist party members twirled their mustaches and decided to wipe out Muslims. China is emphatically not attacking Muslims in general.  In fact many mosques are open in western China and there are Muslims free to practice their religion in other provinces.  If China wanted to slaughter Muslims, why would they simply not have joined American efforts to do so in Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, Syria, or Libya?  Most countries in the middle east understand this, with representatives from many Muslim countries visiting china to inspect these facilities and deciding that there are not widespread institutional crimes going on (that isn't to say there aren't corrupt officials abusing people to induce bribes).

Most Muslim nations benefit from the Chinese Silk road project so a large part of these terrorist groups backers have no interest in antagonising China. There is also the fact that there isn't a significant population of Muslims in China's core territories. Terrorists have little recruits with the main uyghur population having significant restrictions put on it preventing any terrorist attacks. Finally the Chinese state has a stronger control over the media than many Western nations leading to any terrorist actions being not widely known.",

            "A few reasons\n\n1. China response to the Uygur issue is because they were going into Syria and fighting and worried that they were becoming separatist on the belt and road initiative would would bring economic development to the mid-east and Africa. \n2. Despite myth that groups like al-Qaeda are funded by individuals that isn't true they are mostly funded by govt to fight as proxies for specific political goals (like kicking the USSR out of Afghanistan)\n3. China decided to counter the Uygur separatist by building up the economy moving Han Chinese to the area and \"educating\" the population on the evils of fighting Bejing and aggressive policing. \n4. China Muslim allies like Iran and Pakistan don't want to fight China\n5. Saudi is busy funding terrorist/freedom fighter militias in Iraq Syria and Yemen and doesn't need or cant afford another war\n6. China doesn't actually care that much about Muslim populations in China as long as they are (good Muslims (meaning loyal to Bejing)) and not Uygur separatists\n7. Muslims counter to the narrative don't really believe in terrorism. As long as they have freedom of religion or being invaded the mainstream belief is to be passive.

            "The terrorists attack the West because they go for easy marks. 911 was a sucker punch, gotten away with because we were lax. China is not so lax.\n\nSecond, the terrorists have been seriously depleted over the last 20 years of wars. Syria, which was supposed to be the home of their new caliphate, was a bust that left thousands of their members dead.\n\nLack of international support. Iran is the only one who still gives them money, and they have to do it quietly.\n\nLack of success. It's one thing to say you are going to sacrifice your life for the greater glory of a winning cause. Not so much when you see loss after loss.\n\nIsrael. Since 1948 it was the target of both terrorists and Islamic countries, all in support of the Palestinians. Well, that was almost three quarters of a century ago, and still Israel exists. And while no Islamic country calls Israel its \"friend\", they do work with them. Consider Egypt, working to keep weapons from reaching the West Bank. My point being if Israel can keep this up for that long, what chance to terrorists have to make a dent in what China does?\n\nLast point. China is now seeing the beginning of a very bad economic downturn. While they were acting like a bully around the world, especially in diplomatic circles, not they are being snubbed by nations, especially in the Indian Ocean. The Chinese Communist Party will feel the heat, and look to blame others, and take action, to keep its own people from blaming them. They will externalize their problems. And an easy target will be the Chinese Muslims.",

Many are disaffected youths who see no future and have glommed on to something that gives them purpose.  \n\nThe Chinese suppression of Muslims is not a new thing.

The CCP, although made up to look like monsters, have raised huge numbers of their people out of poverty. If I was a Chinese national living in China, Id say they were doing a pretty good job.\n\nIf there was going to be terrorism, it'd more likely be personal vedettas against employers than for folks who aren't even Han Chinese.

They don't get a lot of terrorism directed at them, because you don't bite the hand that feeds you. This is also true of economic sanctions, boycotts, and the other tools of statecraft. Everyone is afraid of biting the hand that feeds.",

That was the incident that began the transformation of Xinjiang from a backwater to a police state. \nNow that it is a police state, it is literally impossible for terrorists to attack in China. Any suspects are immediately taken in and usually thrown in jail on charges. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s right for them to do that.

And Americans eat it up because why think critically if you can get a self-righteous rage boner. Good Americans don't think for themselves. They wait for what their government tells them to think. Not like those Chinese.\n\nMuslims and Uyghurs in China aren't persecuted because of being Muslim or Uyghur.  They are being targeted by a large-scale police operation in response to Uyghur *separatism*  and *terrorism* that has been going on for years.  You can look up Urumqi attacks on Wikipedia.\n\nThe target is not the regular Uyghur population but the Uyghur pIRA or Al-Qaeda, which almost certainly receives help from America in their fight against China because only America would be willing to go against China like this.",

            "The fundamental thing about Islamic terrorists that we have been plagued with ever since our third Caliph was butchered in his home is that they do not get along with other Muslims. \n\nYou see most sects of Islam for the most part are happy to just say the other is misguided, but they're at least still near the right path, they're still Muslim and there is still good in their teachings. \n\nHowever Muslim terrorists, by and large are always some form of Kharajism, which is a sect of Islam that says \"everyone who doesn't do Islam the way I say it is none-Muslim\" and \"if they're none Muslim but pretending to be Muslims they arent just enemies, they are traitors.\" \n\nThe Kharajism of antiquity, naturally broke up into 1000 different sects, which all fought each other until only the moderates of this extreme group survived in then Oman. \n\nThese neo kharajites are exactly the same, obsessed with purging Muslim lands of the not real Muslims. And to show you how extreme they are, notable casualties of Kharajites have been: The prophets Grandson, two of the 10 most pious people in Islam, as well as the fourth Caliph, who was the prophets son in Law. You'll notice for the first 20 years of Islam, Islam conquered: Iran, the Levant, Iraq, Azerbaijan, egypt, Tunisia, lybia, Algeria. But after that it stopped. Why? Because the within Islam these Kharajites broke off, and even though they were granted there own sovereignty they weren't content with that and decided to purge Muslims in Muslim lands. \n\nWhy am I telling you this? Just to show how they will not stop at anything to try and purge Islam of anyone who doesn't follow them and that is their number one priority, in their eyes they and only them have the truth and anyone else, even if they are highest rank of Muslim, said by the prophet himself, are beneath them. Doesn't matter if the Mongols are invading, of Muslims are dying to China, or Israel is oppressing Arabs, or Muslim lands are colonised. Doesn't matter if Christians are marching into Jerusalem. All they know to do is kill other Muslims. \n\nEvery time a Muslim terrorist group has appeared, at least 80 percent of their casualties are other Muslims, and this is including 9/11. \n\nTL:DR They are obsessed with cleansing Islam of any self-claimed Muslim (in their eyes) who aren't following their ways to the letter. They have done this from the beginning and will continue doing this for as long as Islam is a thing. No matter what none Muslims are doing. The Qur'an predicted sects like this and it seems to be right.",

Most yacht clubs have racing nights and boat owners are often looking for crew. It's a great way to get some experience and is normally free\n* Engine maintenance course and buy spares of everything that can break (fan belts, fuel pump, etc) or needs regular replacements (oil filters, oil etc). You *can* get this equipment delivered nearly anywhere in the world but it is often slow and expensive. You don't want to spend 5 weeks at anchor waiting for a 30c o-ring.\n* Learn to provision, provision, and fill up fuel and water tanks\n* Have a way to get weather info when out of cell/radio range, expensive solution is satellite internet / cheap solution is Outernet\n* Check status of equipment and repair/replace where needed (radios, sails, batteries, water tanks, anchor chain, water alarms, etc)\n* Have repair kits for the sail and hull\n* Get comfortable wet weather gear and sun protection\n* Check safety gear and get a harness for nights at the helm\n* You will want crew if you are sailing over nighters, there are loads of sites to get crew\n* Do a first aid course and get a decent first aid kit including any drugs you might need\n* Get vaccinated for anywhere you may visit and have a stock of anti malaria and anti worm drugs\n* Install a navigation app like Navionics on a tablet and your phone and make any charts you'll need available offline. IMO, an app solution is better than an expensive marine GPS/chart. You can install an app on half a dozen old phones for redundancy and the charts are up to date\n* A grab bag with water and provisions in case of catastrophe\n* A decent tender with 8+ hp so that you can use it to move your boat in case of emergency and leave your boat if you anchor somewhere with a strong current (think the Hudson river)\n* Maybe a life raft\n\nI'm sure I'm missing some practical advice here but the sailing community is great and super helpful. Just be aware of \"arm chair sailors\", people with loads of advice but that have never actually done any major trips. These people are dangerous and confidently give rubbish advice.

The thing is, (in most cases) border security is meant to patrol people entering a country, not leaving, however typically you don't leave a country without entering another country, so normally we go through security both ways.\n\nSo the way I see it, as long as you're not wanted for murder or something, law enforcement is not going to come looking for you, unless your family reports you missing and sends out a search party. Now if you did spend many years at sea then decided to return, you may have issues with citizenship, healthcare, credit and the likes.\n\nPractically, you are probably gonna die. The ocean is a very dangerous place even in the short term, but if you wanted to be self sufficient in the open ocean it would be very difficult. You would need a boat of sufficient size to plant a garden for food and desalinate water or capture rainwater to drink. You would have to go fishing for protein. You would also need to find a relatively calm part of the ocean because storms would be devastating. Eventually your clothes would wear out and without docking somewhere you would have no way to replace them. Any crops you lost would also be gone forever.

            "I actually looked into this quite a bit.\n\nWhen you are within another country\u2019s waters you are required to have registration and a passport, and enter via a valid port of entry.  You can\u2019t just deposit yourself on a beach in Spain and run to the store for supplies.  You need a home port that you will have a registered address at for mail, correspondence, etc.\n\nLogistically speaking, you have an abundant source of food if you don\u2019t mind fish every day.  You will need a source of vitamins to prevent various malnutrient diseases.  Scurvy for example, is from a lack of Vitamin C.\n\nYou will need a supply of clean water.  You can process it yourself using an evaporator.  I don\u2019t think the tried and true \u201cjust leave water in the sun\u201d will provide enough daily hydration.  Boiling it yourself will be too energy intensive compared to an evaporator.\n\nFinally it comes down to power.  You will need a radio for weather reports, a GPS to know where you are,  a sat phone for an emergency, a small cooker for cooking your fish, and a small fridge for storage of things like water.  You need to determine your power requirements and the battery necessities to keep things alive overnight.  Most everything can be shut off unless you need it, so your energy generation and storage are highly dependent on you.  Freezers are a waste of energy, the powers required for freezing and then cooking from freezing is more than you should want to take on.\n\nIf you are seriously considering it, I would 100% percent recommend starting in WA go off the coast and live 100% offline while you sail to Panama, and then swap sides to go to NY or Maine.  That way you aren\u2019t far from help and can get the experience to what immediate needs might arise.  The currents go down the west coast and up the east coast, so the only time you have to \u201cfight\u201d what Neptune wants is when you are switching sides.\n\nOnce you are ready, and sailed the North/South American coasts a few times without stopping, you can set your eyes on a transatlantic voyage.  All you have to do is head to the Northeastern coast and start heading east.  You will hit the Atlantic winds and they will carry you to northern Europe or Africa depending on where you got picked up.   Then start heading South until you hit central Africa,  turn West and start heading out.  The winds will pick you up and take you to Florida.  Crossings the Atlantic takes 2-4 months depending on the wind.  You really can\u2019t mess it up unless you fight the ocean OR ignore your GPS.  The ocean won\u2019t take you to shore but it will take you close enough.",

All of that is mad expensive, especially if you plan to spend the rest of your life on the ocean (based on the vibe of the question that sounds like it's the intent).\n\nLegally I think you're fine. No country legally owns an ocean. You might get into trouble when you get too close to waters where refugees pass, areas with bordering nations disputes. There was an incident in the past where several international ships got trapped in the suddenly non operational Suez canal during a time of Egyptian political strife.\n\nThose are special cases though. Assuming you have the funds, means, and conviction to do it, and avoid waters with political conflicts, it should be happy sailing!\n\nFun fact: if you want to REALLY get away from it all, Point Nemo in the southeast pacific is the furthest point from land in any direction, and thus any humans, on the planet. You'd be closer to the astronauts aboard the ISS as it passes over you than any other human. Just watch out for falling, decommissioned satellites and spaceship parts; they get dropped around there to minimize potential casualties.",

You will need to find out beforehand if you are going to have medical complications sailing like no point on just yeeting into the sunset on a boat if you are going to be also an unlucky sod who has really bad motion sickness...unless you love it that much then learn how to manage your symptoms. You need to remember to bring fresh water or a way to make fresh water and also emergency rations and regular supplies for eating. Even if you are intending to fish for your dinner every day on your new boat journey you should bring some type of food to supplement or to replace if you have a few shit days of casting. If you are going to sail around the world you should learn safe routes and also how to read weather maps as well as how to operate a radio system.\n\nBut if you are going to do the RV version (Buy a boat and sail your national coastline) there isn't that many barriers. Just learn where the conservation areas are so you don't accidentally sail into them and also any local bylaws for the regions you might sail to.",

Enrollment is dropping, costs being one issue. The whole college system we\u2019ve set up isn\u2019t going to keep being sustainable forever. Kids today are deciding themselves not to take on these costs. WV is also super trade school friendly. Trade jobs are getting more bang for the buck. I took on student loans but if I were 18 again today I\u2019d know better. There\u2019s more public information about other options and about student loans available now. My parents didn\u2019t grow up in a job market saturated with college graduates, so their perspective on the power of a degree was different.",

Now tuition is so high because of guaranteed loans, that more working class people are forgoing education. Right back where we started - education is too expensive for the average person and we'll be in a society where only kids from rich families go to college if we continue on this path.",
            "Because the solution to that is for state legislatures to fund higher education at the levels they did 40 years ago. But as soon as they discovered that pretty much anyone could get a loan, they cut funding, raised tuition, and put that burden on the students.",

I'm working extra during the summer so I can afford the tuition and not be stuck with loans still at nearly 40 years old like my older siblings are.",
            "If the US stopped handing out student loans, it would run out of professionals in a few decades. Very few people could afford to attend college, much less universities.\n\nIn huge contrast, the costs of attending a university in Europe is stupid low in comparison,  some are free\n\n[Comparison](https://beyondthestates.com/resources/college-in-europe-9-reasons-to-study-here#:~:text=Undergraduate%20programs&text=In%20contrast%20to%20higher%20tuition,per%20year%20for%20American%20students.).",
            "Odd (and possibly controversial) opinion here. But my take is it falls back to no child left behind policies.\n\nOnce upon a time (back in dinosaur age of the 90s) it was pretty normal for kids to fail in high school and leave with out a qualification. This meant that if you had a high school diploma, employers could trust that you were hard working and had some basic intelligence. Getting a high school qualification, which was mostly free, gave you a significant edge in early life.\n\nWell meaning politicians noticed that high school graduates were more successful in life. So they implemented no child left behind, which was designed to ensure every child graduated high school. Problem was the implementation was poor and it created a perverse incentive scheme where high schools were encouraged to drop their graduating standards and pass everybody. \n\nNow suddenly employers are faced with high school diploma kids that have no work ethic and are dumb as bricks. Getting a high school diploma is meaningless. So employers start doing the next best thing and asking everyone for a bachelors for entry level positions. They don't need the bachelors specifically, they just want proof of work. Universities note the surge in demand and start charging to balance supply to demand. Demand keeps going up, and we end up with the price spiral that gets us to today.\n\nMy solution (also controversial) would be to make the high school diploma matter again. The free and compulsory education system should be targeting a failure rate of 30-40 percent. This would make high school diplomas meaningful as proof of work for employers, which would drop the demand for degrees. Lower demand mean prices could drop to reasonable levels.",
            "Because countries with easier access to higher education are generally better off. Student loans are a way of enabling those without the money to get that education. I for one would never have been able to get my degree without a loan.\n\nOf course the best solution is to just make the education free in the first place like how it is in Scotland but I guess loan forgiveness is the best compromise to hope for at the moment.",
            "The government largely controls the debt being talked about. They don\u2019t really control the underlying institutions causing debt to spiral. They SHOULD be adding incentives to lower tuition and creating roadblocks for those who don\u2019t. But that might not be taken well by the billion dollar college industry. \n\nColleges are used to operating as increasingly large sports leagues instead of prioritizing education. They don\u2019t particularly want to stop that and it will take a lot to change it.",
            "It\u2019s from the myth that everyone has to go to college.  Many people shouldn\u2019t, for many reasons, and taking out huge loans is their choice.",
            "Bc our whole system is based on grifting young ppl into things they don\u2019t understand. \n\nEven the colleges are a scam. Look if the point of college was about information and learning, the internet would have killed it bc you can learn anything for free\u2026 No college is about networking and gatekeeping\n\nWhat they don\u2019t tell you is you probably don\u2019t need a degree to do the job you\u2019re doing.",
            "If they don't loan them how will they afford the school? You missed one step: stop charging tens of thousands of dollars for a semester or two.

It\u2019s unconscionable, and state governments should start taking swift action against bloat in public colleges, because not enough students even have a choice to not pay for this bloat.\n\nThe other part is the problem, however, is many students and parents are choosing this bloat. People offered more services and huge wasters like DEI often say Yes, I want it but don\u2019t really consider, What would I want to pay for it? And because the cost is not felt until later, when paying the loans, it\u2019s too easy to just go along with it.\n\nI think American higher education is in for a rude set of disruptions in the coming years, and it can\u2019t come fast enough.",

A more productive society benefits everyone within that society. \nThe issue is not that we give out loans to help people find upward mobility the issue is the gross inaccessibility of education due to a line drawn in the sand from wealth. If you\u2019re too poor college is out of the question. That is the way it already is for so many Americans. So when people use this argument it\u2019s not only inaccurate, but not observing the entire system. Yes, many do recieve loans they can\u2019t pay back. This is due to a litany of reasons: the interest is too high, the loan was too large proportionally to their income level, the individual couldn\u2019t become employed the way they hoped. Education is of course a portion of the battle in upward mobility. Someone with a great education can still end up without their goal career because of all sorts of factors. One large one is geography. Many people will live within 50 miles of where they graduate college simply because that is what is accessible to them given their income/situation. \nFor as many Americans there are that take out loans there\u2019s just as many or more that don\u2019t even attempt going to college because of the debt threat it entails.

If no, then you are penalizing people for trying and then who have some other life circumstance occur or aren't academically capable. Sure you could create lots of various subgroups but...\n\nIf you DO include them, then that may present moral hazard, incentivizing potentially wasteful use of a benefit.\n\nWith any government program, targeting is a big issue, probably the biggest issue. Inevitably, people are included and excluded who shouldn't be. There is a cost incurred for more precise targeting and sometimes it isn't worth it; in other words opening the floodgates is cheaper than asking for identification and checking that they brought the correct bucket size to the dam.\n\nIf you want to include everyone, then paying in real time makes the most sense.\n\nIf you want to only include some, perhaps those who finished or quit for some qualifying reason, then paying after the fact makes most sense. This implies those who quit for the \"wrong\" reasons (academic dishonesty, crime, etc) would be saddled with debt.\n\nThere are already programs that pay after the fact, some \"loan forgiveness\" programs meant for people in government jobs or other things.\n\nWe already have knowledge and data about how effective these after-the-fact programs are, and it is not very happy news.\n\nIf you are talking about practicality, having a bureaucracy to judge reasons for quitting would be a nightmare; just look at trying to get on disability or any other government benefit, the length of time it takes, the crappy appeals process, if any.\n\nIf govt paid, think of all the grift and fraud from for-profit unis. There is already so much regarding loans.\n\nIMO, the best (not necessarily politically feasible) is to have govt pay for public unis, and the unis themselves police who can be there (kicking people out due to academics, crime, etc, like they do now; admitting people based on merit)."

            "In addition to sign language, the Humane Society has a list of universal commands.  Here's a quick sample:\n\nhttp://www.dog-training-excellence.com/support-files/hand-signals-chart-free-download.pdf\n\nOne thing to pay attention to is commands that are visible from a distance.  Sure, you can use sign language, but with any dog there may be a critical time and place when you *need* them to obey at a distance.  For example, if your dog has gotten loose and is across the street, and they see you and start to run back, and a car is coming ... can you give a command that they can both SEE and understand at a distance?  \n\nFor example, the command for \"sit\" is not, as many people use, pointing at the ground in front of you.  The distance command is to put your arm straight out to your side, and *then* bend your forearm up towards the sky.  This command can easily be seen hundreds of feet away.  The command for \"lay down\" is arm out, forearm down.  Lastly, the command for \"come\" is arm out, forearm down, but moving in a circular motion while pointed at the ground.  At least these were the norm 15 years ago. \n\nOne last *really important tip*:  Dogs are \"location specific learners\".  That means if you teach them a new trick while at home, it basically only applies when they are at home.  Many dogs will struggle to follow the command while you are in a car, walking them, at a store or park, etc.  As a result, any command you teach them needs to be re-taught in new locations.  Many people get mad when their dog is so well behaved at home, but then seems completely nuts while out - this is why.  \n\nI taught my old Great Danes upwards of 30-40 commands.  Just about everything you can think of.  That sit and lay down command came in handy one day, because as I explained, my dog had gotten out, and was about to cross the street when a car was coming.\n\nGood luck!",

            "Oh! I have a few things to add here!\nFirstly, depending on her type of hearing loss, she may still be able to hear you conductively. Anyone remember those toothbrushes that played a song in vibrations in your mouth? Try resting your chin against the top of her head and praising her in a low voice. The brain interprets the vibrations into sound.\n\nIf that works it will make teaching a gesture much easier, as you can do both at once for a while (cumbersome, but effective). Failing that you\u2019ll need to teach it like a whole new command, even though she already knows the \u2018good girl\u2019 phrase.

We noticed the dog becoming more and more anxious, and then one day I told him he was a good boy and nothing - no tail wag, no reaction. It was like he\u2019d forgotten the phrase entirely, it had been so long. So we decided it was time to bring him home, re-taught him praise and now he can\u2019t contain his happiness at the phrase again! ",

            "My mother used to work with behavorial training with dogs other people had given up on - dogs that had been exposed to trauma, bit children, destroyed homes due to separation anxiety, or were so aggressive they were going to have to be put down. She had an intensive program where the dogs lived with us for a month, and then she treated them with training with their owners for about a year after that. All of them survived and got better, but as you can imagine it required a lot of work and being able to develop very clear communication with the dogs.\nShe regularly took interns, but they mainly studied how she worked, as it was usually too difficult for them to build a relationship with the dogs in the short while they\u2019d be there. Obviously it could also be dangerous to have them engage with the dogs too quickly if they didn\u2019t really know what they were doing (as a sidenote though - she always used me and my sister to work with the dogs who were afraid of children, she was definitely more worried for her interns\u2019 safety than for ours, haha) \nOnce, a mother called her and asked if her daugther could intern at the training site. My mother immidiately said no, and explained that a person who cannot call and ask themselves are not ready to work with dogs that have as massive behavioral issues as the ones she was working with. \nThis mother apologized and said that she should have explained earlier on that she was calling because her daughter had been deaf since birth, and she couldn\u2019t call on her own without an interpreter service. She explained that no one would give her a chance to work with dogs because of her disability, but that she studied at a high school that was intergrated animal studies, and that all she wanted to do was to work with the dogs that others wouldn\u2019t.\nMom figured it was worth a chance and let this girl come visit, and she got the internship and got to work extra for the company a while afterwards, because she was the best intern my mother ever had. \nMy mother didn\u2019t know any sign so they mainly communicated via text. However, this girl singlehandedly taught all the dogs sign while she was working there, staying late hours to work on communication with them. \nThey were so gentle and so responsive to whatever she was doing, and it seemed much more natural to the dogs than auditory commands did. They picked them up so fast, and they were incredibly engaged. \nIt wasn\u2019t really a shock to my mother, who mainly worked with body language anyway, except for how quickly they differentiated the signs - even the more complex ones, and how much more attentive and social the dogs were when they weren\u2019t given any auditory cues at all. \nHonestly, I still remember seeing her with the dogs and it was just something else. They picked up on the smallest of movement, things that were hard for me to comprehend. \nSo, yeah, i guess this was a very long story for a pretty basic and simple point - I really recommend learning some sign and using it with your dog. I am sure she would pick up on it very quickly and that it would feel great for both you and her as you realize how much she can comprehend despite her hearing loss. \nI have been interested in sign ever since and I have also found it useful in other areas of my life (i am studying to become a psychologist, and honestly, knowing a few shared signs when someone has a panic attack has been absolutely amazing. If you teach your friends it also helps basic communication in bars or concert venues or other noisy places) and there are loads of great resources online. My best trick has been to look up songs or nursery rhymes that include some words I want to learn, and then practicing them. It is actually a very quick and fun process, and once you have some basic vocabulary down it becomes much easier to learn the more complex stuff. \nBest of luck! \n\n",
            "As corny as this may sound. Your smile is an amazing power. \n\nI can look at my dog and smile, he\u2019ll start wagging his tail and come to me. Then the belly rubs. ",
            "First step, it will be hard. Stop talking to your dog. I mean sure if you want to use your dog as a diary and let them know all your boy troubles or whatever go for it but your dog cant hear you anymore.\n\nI would start by renaming her to something she understands like a flashlight wiggling on the floor. Once she has mastered knowing when you wiggle the light at her your calling to her then you can start incoporaing that. Dogs love being called by their names in a positive manner. She will learn that the wiggling light means \"hey come here, I have food and pets\". \n\nOften when a dog goes deaf we still talk to them, by limiting your vocal outputs and only communicating in the manner she can grasp you can feel the frustration and be creative in solutions instead of feeling annoyed and dumb for saying \"good girl\".\n\nSimple hand gestures like pointing, thumbs up and even human facial expressions can be learnt by dogs fairly well. Your dog will jump at the oppotunity to have good clear communication with you. I mean you wouldnt \"talk\" with your mouth to a deaf person who cant understand that, it would be weired or disrespectful and strange-feeling. ",

She smiles when she's happy or agrees with whatever I am offering.  When I ask if she is a good girl or a pretty girl she would always smile..that wasn't taught to her.  She did that from day one BUT since we took her in...she's learned to nod her head 'yes' in response as well.  Our vet literally called *everyone* in the office to see this.  Dogs are very intelligent and attentive.  They pay attention to more than just what they hear.  They pay ALOT of attention in your expressions and general body language.  They know when your upset or happy, angry or sad?  That's not from your commands.  Choose specific actions you've used in the past when encouraging your dog and focus on those.  My girl Emma knows when I'm messing with her because she looks for my smile and she smiles back.  She hears me through body language and I hear her the same way.  Pay as much attention to them as they do you and you can make that connection your looking for.",

I would put mayonnaise on all my finger tips, and Buddy would do all ten fingers while I counted 1 through 10. If I looked at him -- I taught him also how to spell mayonnaise. He would smack his lips. Be patient -- animals are very smart. I think she'll come around.  He had kidney disease and he lived on mayonnaise his last few months.

            "Yes. It's usually not great for your sleep if you do this repeatedly during the night, it usually means you are going to miss deeper sleep in favor of fairly shallow and/or REM sleep. You typically (in a healthy individual, usually) enter REM in shallower states, hence the increase of memory of dreams. If you make a habit of doing it in the morning, it may have a negative impact on your day (kind of like taking too long a nap, if you are in the wrong \"state\" it can set up your day negatively and eventually have a long term affect on your body's regulation of sleep if you are doing this artificially)\n\nMany who don't remember their dreams are quite healthy sleepers because they are reaching deep, restful sleep for a prolonged period. Many with sleep disorders dream quite a bit because they vacillate in and out of and enter lighter sleep states for too long or too often.\n\nLucid dreaming is gaining awareness in the dream that you are dreaming, and gaining the ability to control and influence and experience the dream state without leaving it. \n\nHaving taken some powerful medication to regulate my sleep state, it was almost disturbing and sad to see my dreams gradually reduce and at times disappear. It is well worth the ability to maintain attention and health throughout the day, though.",
            "I do the exact same thing, and I'm not even too tired when I first wake up. I just love the feeling of waking up and going back to sleep and that kind of bleary state. And this is usually what makes me late lol. Ive never heard anyone else talk about this",
            "When we sleep, we pass through several distinct cycles in which our brains behaviour differs at different stages within the cycle. \n\nREM sleep (rapid eye movement ) is the stage at which we dream. During REM brain activity is very similar to when we are awake unlike the other stages; because your brain is effectively awake but in an illusionary dream world. Some brain areas such as the prefrontal cortex which controls executive function such as rational thought are inactive during sleeping(otherwise you would realise you were asleep due to the strange narratives that unfold during dreams). \n\n(Not certain but I imagine based on what I know that the following is true) if you're frequently passing between being awake and sleeping. I imagine you would not have time to enter deep sleep stages and your sleep would be more likely to remain in REM due to the short period of sleeping. This would mean the frequency of dreams would increase so you'd be more likely to recall them.\n\nA second thing to note is that you're more likely to remember a dream if you wake up during REM, so as a result if youre waking up frequently you're more likely to wake up during a period of REM and recall the dream content. \n\nAs for whether you are lucid dreaming I can't answer that. Lucid dreaming is the state of being self aware while dreaming. Only you can establish whether that is the case. I can however say that possibly (building upon what I said earlier) if your drifting in and out of sleep, your prefrontal cortex may be less inhibited than it would ordinarily be during REM and as a result you may be more likely to become lucid during a dream.\n\nfun fact: during REM (as you may have guessed due to the name) the eyes move, they do so interestingly, in relation to dream content e.g if you were dreaming about watching a tennis match it would mean, firstly you should probably pick up some hobbies because your life is dull as fuck; and secondly your eyes would move horizontally following the imagined ball. You can observe when someone is in REM because their eyes will move beneath their eyelids.\n\nSources: Dement and Kleitman's (1957); I am a student of psychology.",

Yet, I've been able to do it for as long as I can remember. I think true lucid dreaming is more you can control every aspect of said dream whereas I've just touched the surface.

I've done several sleep studies, and generally this happens when I'm extremely tired - I fall asleep and very quickly enter REM sleep, sometimes bypassing other sleep stages entirely and sometimes not. I'm not sure if it's truly lucid dreaming, but I'll definitely be dreaming about the same things I was thinking of right before falling asleep, and remember everything upon waking - if I fall right back asleep and into a dream the cycle continues, so overall it's more like a series of dreams that I can remember and are linked together by a common thread of whatever I'm thinking about while conscious.

            "So odd that I'm seeing this right now.   This morning,  around 5am my giant of a puppy woke me barking...I got up, checked to see if perhaps someone was in the yard, released the big barking baby into the backyard for a minute to ensure there were no intruders, and went back to bed.  I drifted off, but not totally (I guess?) and started having a weird and vivid dream, within my dream I realized it was a dream...and started doing things with intent, changing small things and such.  My body then decided that my intent was no longer allowed,  my dream turned into something really weird...I was in a totally different place, seated at a table in a tent, with a weird piece of art beside me.  A massive person started walking toward me, but I couldn't move or speak...yet I still knew I was dreaming.   The person grabbed the art beside me, and all of a sudden they were outside of the tent touching my back through the tent.  I knew it was a dream, couldn't speak or move, though.  I was no longer in the dream after a minute or two, but in my bed...still with something touching my back through fabric of some kind (and I couldn't see,  but knew I was in bed).  As much as I tried,  I couldn't speak or move...I knew I was sleeping,  but I wasn't sleeping totally?  Anyway,  it took quite a while to snap out of it...it felt like I was fighting to make a sound, and just couldn't.   I was beginning to think someone had broken in to my house or something.   I just wanted to wake up, but felt like I was awake?...and couldn't move or speak.  Finally,  it stopped (6am or so at that point), and I made a strange sound...and sort of exhaled, like I'd been holding my breath for a long time.  I've had this happen a few times before,  but nothing this intense.   Absolutely creepy what your own body can make you believe and do, in that place between awake and asleep.

            "REM sleep is a biological requirement.  Every time you wake up and then fall asleep, you're rushing through the early stages of sleep to hit REM faster.  The more you wake up, the faster you'll get back, and the more bizarre dreams you'll experience.\n\nWe don't know why, we just know that REM is very important to the body.",
            "I\u2019ll go to bed early just so I can can wake up between midnight and 2, then go back to sleep. \n\nI\u2019m no sleep scientist but I think what you\u2019re describing is the REM cycles of deep sleep, then shallower sleep, then back to deep sleep. Your shallow sleep becomes too wakeful and you become conscious/dreamy. Beware sleep paralysis tho.",
            "I believe you are talking about something like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biphasic_and_polyphasic_sleep), also something called [uberman sleep](https://www.polyphasicsociety.com/polyphasic-sleep/overviews/uberman-2/), you are triggering your brain into REM as soon as you close your eyes",

            "Best dreams? When I do that I get seriously crazy fucked up dreams. \n\nBut in answer to your question,  yes. Because you're so close to being awake your brain is firing on many cylinders. Pretty much lucid dreams",
            "I'm no expert but I think it has to do with the fact that you are stopping yourself from reaching the deeper stages of sleep and instead can only reach the lighter stages more associated with dreaming. Only with at least a few hours of sleep, and ideally around 8 hours non-stop, can you reach and get lots of the deeper stages. But, I believe the lighter stages, like dreaming, are more associated with mental clarity, while the deeper stages are associated more with healing the body. So, that would explain why you \"feel so good,\" if by that you mean mentally you feel alert and sharp, but I would be willing to bet your body feels slightly more sluggish and sore than usual, as you jipped yourself of the more deeper stages of sleep.",
            "I did this in 1.5-2 hr sessions a lot in college insteinstead of all nighters. Like I'd set a timer for 1.5-2 hrs, depending on how fast I'd figure I'd fall asleep.",
            "If you're not realizing it, then you aren't lucid dreaming, because lucid dreaming is realizing you're dreaming and being able to take control of the dream (which can be very cool and fun, but takes practice). You're probably just remembering your dream more clearly because you woke up close to dreaming.",
            "I like it because 5 minutes can feel like an hour.",
            "It's because when you're having 'mini naps' with brief periods of being awake you're more likely to have lucid dreams or false awakenings etc. So the dreams are much more vivid and easily remembered and generally, whatever you were thinking for the brief period you were awake you can more often than not dream about... it's why I used to love waking up every half hour or so with my alarm on snooze... I'd wake up and think about a situation or a character or something and I'd end up being able to lucid dream about them. It's awesome. I still do that often nowadays before work... snooze for an hour with the alarm going off every 15 minutes - think about Pennywise the clown and get some awesome dreams :P",
            "I love doing this. I set random alarms to go off every couple hours, even the middle of the night just to wake up and go back to sleep. But it does make me.l realise I dream about some really weird shitt.",

            "Actually, you're deep sleeping, and can't wake up because of that, and you dream bc of that. I have that. Is that what you talking about?",

            "It's because you're awaking during REM sleep so you remember the dream vividly. \n\nYou have dreams every single night, you just don't always remember them. Dreams are actually how our mind prepares for possible future situations but constructing new subconscious memories from old information\n\nNetflix just released a (albeit short) documentary on dreams",

            "There are 4 layers of sleep before you hit a deep sleep. These 4 layers work in a cycle about every 45 minutes. Only at the height of each cycle is your brain awake enough to dream and remember dreams. If you continuously wake yourself up every 20 minutes you will never reach that full deep sleep, so you will only be able to reach dream state",
            "If you wake up in the middle of an REM cycle (the deepest sleep state) and then fall back asleep immediately, you bypass several sleep stages that lead up to REM. Basically, by falling right back asleep, you drop directly into REM sleep, which often causes extremely vivid dreams.",
            "Try getting high and doing it. It will last 3 hours.",

            "If I do this I get sleep paralysis. As soon as I am able to break it I fall back asleep, and the cycle repeats until I'm able to keep myself awake. I would love to know why",
            "So I have a problem with doing this. I lucid dream, but this is more what I call a half sleep because I can't really control it. When i'm in the morning phase of that extra few minutes sometimes when I drift off a bit I 'dream' my morning process - showering dressing and then I wake up realizing i'm still in bed in my boxers and now running late. \n\nWeirdest thing I've begun experiencing in the past couple of years is having my eyes closed but seeing my room. I don't know how to explain it any better,  but I'll be in bed, darkness, eyes closed but I can see my room as if my eyes were open. \n\nI'm also really twitchy/ reactive. If i'm dreaming about playing baseball or soccer, my arms or legs will react. My ex woke me up once saying i was dream eating, putting my hand to my mouth and chewing. I should probably get my brain checked",
            "You are WILDing - wake induced lucid dreaming",
            "Ive realized I\u2019m dreaming several times, it is so much fun. It gives me so much joy when I see someone who has passed away and I realize it and get to enjoy the dream with them.",
            "I used to do this in HS but for the middle of the night....I started to have really weird and intense dreams (I usually do, but more so)....from pennywise  living on the moon, to a white out with a high pitched ringing in earth science class. It got fucked up and intense enough to make me stop",
            "No but that's almost a way to initiate lucid dreaming. It's called WILD, or Wake Induced Lucid Dreaming.\n\nIt happened to me once clearly when I was about 21. I woke up at 445 AM and drove 45 minutes to work. When I got there, the vehicle I was supposed to drive that day was down, so I drove 45 minutes back home.\n\nAfter being up for over  90 minutes but arriving home around 630 AM I went back to bed. I don't remember that lucid dream specifics, but I definitely went lucid.\n\nThere's many other lucid dream techniques, but wake induced was always had the best results for me.",
            "You're most likely false waking up and actually dreaming. This happens to me a lot.",
            "I find I get lucid-ish dreaming like this! Like I am aware at some level that I am dreaming, but can't control anything. I find my dreams also tend to have arcs and cohesive plots when I repeated wake.\n\nAnother cool phenomenon is that for a time I could catch myself before I started dreaming. Like, before falling 100% asleep I wouldn't start heavy dreaming, but I could tell that my brain was starting to vividly think things that weren't real. It was awesome to surf that crest of dreaming. It still happens every now and then but not as often as it used to.",
            "Actually when this happens to me I just feel terrible in the morning for some reason",
            "I can't scientifically answer but can agree. The past weeks or so I've really noticed this. I set alarms for about an hour an always have vivid dreams in the short time span.",
            "Probably not right, but I remember hearing on a Joe Rogan Podcast that his guest slept in 4 hour increments,  saying that he feels better and more rested doing this, thinking it's an old evolutionary trait going back to our more nomadic days",
            "Brains and dreams are crazy. A little more than two months ago, my ex-girlfriend broke with me, and I swear she is the love of my life. I bought her wedding rings a few months before, but didn't got married. I almost never in my life remember dreams, but since then, I'm dreaming with her EVERY SINGLE NIGHT. Literally a nightmare, knowing that she wants nothing with me, but waking up every single day having dreamt of being happy together, always a different dream, a different reality.",
            "Yeah this is a widely known lucid dreaming technique when you're first learning or when you're advanced. Something about waking up and then going back to sleep really does something to the REM cycle and it allows you to have more control for lucid dreaming. Another good tip is to write down your dreams when you wake up, either on paper or use talk to text on your cell. Throughout the day do a reality check and ask yourself if you're dreaming. PS everytime I lucid dream I get so excited and then forget. \ud83d\ude2d",
            "Me too. Amazing vivid dreams, some lucid... I wonder if you drop right back into REM when you hit snooze?",
            "No, you aren't lucid dreaming.  You're remembering your dreams.  Any time we wake up we can remember out dreams, and then we forget them as they aren't committed to long term memory.  Lucid dreaming is completely different.",
            "That's an interesting question, because theoretically, the brain dreams in REM and you have to achieve three stages before getting there. I want this!",
            "I know how you feel. I have the best dreams in the 15 minute segments between my snooze alarm.",
            "I've noticed that, too. I wake up early (6 am) every morning to take my dog outside, then feed him and go back to sleep most days. I always have the most vivid dreams in that time after I've fallen back asleep. My best guess based on data from my Apple Watch is that I'm usually in REM sleep at that point. Guess that particular sleep stage has something to do with dreaming/remembering your dreams?",
            "I kinda do this when I\u2019m too lazy to get up for school. I end up getting ready in my dream and then wake up confused because I thought I already got ready for school.",
            "Same. I've been noticing this a lot over this summer because I don't have much to do so often just go back to sleep. These past few months have had the most intense dreams of probably my whole life. A few nights ago I remembered 5 or 6 unique dreams total from a single night.",
            "I got pretty good at doing this stoned and its a radical time",
            "By definition you can't be lucid dreaming without knowing it.",
            "I had this happen to me while I was detoxing from alcohol and I would not classify it as good",
            "Wish I felt good when this happened. Instead I have crippling anxiety haha",
            "You could choose to set the intention of realizing that you're in a dream and likely achieve some level of lucidity if you were clear on what you wanted to create",
            "Hey, that happened to me not too long ago. It made it wayyyyyyyyyyy easier for me to lucid dream, but I don't think you'd do it without realising that's what you're doing, because lucidity is the awareness that that you're dreaming.\n\nIf you're not aware that you're aware, are even aware at all?",
            "A while back I was doing this (maybe a year ago when I was really interesting in lucid dreaming) and I repeatedly would set alarms and wake up every fifteen minutes or so like you described. \nAfter about 4 or 5 times of snoozing I shut my alarm off and went back to sleep for a good while. I ended up having the same dream about 3 times, so by the fourth time I caught on and actually realized I was dreaming. \nAs soon as I realized it though, I got excited and instantly woke up. The weirdest part was I actually felt like a chemical get sucked back into my brain or something.",
            "I used to do this and love it. Then my dreams became nightmares, and that's how I found out I've got sleep apnea @_@",
            "Everytime you wake up you reset your sleep cycle and once you get back to sleep again, you reach REM sleep directly. REM is when you have vivid dreams. When you normally sleep at night, you reach REM and because you're tired, slip past REM into NREM and deep sleep stages, hence the reason why you cant remember dreams well. But waking up and sleeping again causes you to get in and out of REM stage repeatedly.\nLucid dreaming is when youre aware inside your dream that youre dreaming and this provides you with the ability to control your dreams. If that's what's happening, yes youre having lucid dreams. Else, it's just some vivid REM dreams that youre having. :)",

This is also why sometimes, even after a good night sleep, you remember your dreams well. You Wake-up gently and make the transition from deep sleep, to sleep, to rem sleep to being awake :) with practice, REM sleep becomes lucid dreams and you can control it.",
            "Man idk if this is related but I used to do this thing every day when I was younger. I'd wake up to my alarm, then fall asleep again and have a super detailed lifelike dream of me getting ready. Like getting up, walking downstairs, having a shower, sitting down and eating cereal which I could actually taste. I think the furthest I ever made it was being in the car on my way to school. All this before hearing my mom call me saying I was gonna be late and waking up super pissed that I had to get ready all over again.",

            "Another good name for a dream is a sleep keeper. Humans are very defensive and always want to be aware of their surroundings to know they are safe. So the idea of sleeping where you are defenseless goes against that but we still need our sleep. So to keep us asleep when we need it we trick ourselves into thinking we are awake and responsive by dreaming. Dreams are needed most when you are in your lightest stages of sleeping in between your sleep cycles or when there is a lot of external stimuli on your sleeping body. Lucid dreaming is trying to be aware of when you are dreaming. After some personal experimentation I found it can be dangerous and unhealthtly because you are fighting a natural method of getting enough sleep. The tossing and turning means you have enough sleep but you may not want or have to get up yet and your body may be tired and want to relax. But you will naturally fall into your habits of falling asleep when laying down in a dark room, thus you will dream to keep yourself asleep but then wake up because you have enough sleep, then turn over and repeat. Healthy sleeping patterns and habits are important to a healthy life. Also humans are efficient and use dreams as a \"testing world\" to play out different hopes and fears to get \"practice\".",
            "I started having lucid dreams around 16-17. They slowly became more real and controlled, eventually I became insomniac and had very difficult time ever sleeping. I'm 30 now and still have them dreams occasionally but I try and ignore it.",
            "You only dream your brain is most active during your sleep cycle.\n\nI went to a sleep seminar once and we were told every had an 'ultridium rhythm'. This is a timeline of when your body feels most awake and most tired. The rhythm/cycle has a period of an hour and a half and it's continuous.\nSo for example one person may feel naturally most awake at 9:00pm then most tired at 9:45pm, then back to most awake again at 10:30pm.\nThis is why there will be times when you feel exhausted, but by the time you've taken yourself up to bed to feel wide awake again.\nYour ultridium rhythm continues whilst you sleep, so you have periods of when your in a deeper and not as deep sleep.\nWhen your at the more awake stages of the cycle this is when you experience REM (rapid eye movement) which is when you dream.\nSo if you're waking up then falling back asleep and waking up again within the space of 45 minutes you'll probably have some crazy dreams.",

You then force yourself awake for about 30 minutes however avoiding physical activity, your body should stay as turned off as possible.

I spent so much time trying to do other things that I didn't really even know who I was... if that makes sense.\n\nDuring this isolation I have been able to really look introspectively as to who I am as a person \n\nI have determined that I am a good son to my parents. A good brother to my siblings. An awesome uncle. A good friend.. I look at my dog and I can see the love she has for more me. I've determined that as a whole I am a good person.\n\nI have realized that I can comfortable with who I am. Before I was always trying to fit in with all sorts of things. Now I know more of what my direction and ideals/beliefs, and Interests are.\n\nI was able to indulge in some nostalgia and play some games ive all but forgotten and never really had time to finish. I even busted out the GameCube and nintendo 64, xbox 360 and just indulged in some things I loved from childhood. I even found that peoppe were still even playing Halo 3 and Halo reach online! I had a blast \n\nI have majorly gotten myself into cooking. Before my meals basically consisted of food from places like chipotle, noodles and company, etc. Now I've realized that when I put my mind to it, homemade food can be fucking delicious. I even plan meals throughout the week based on what ingredients I have!\n\nI have read a lot more. Before I'd be hard pressed to read 1 book a year. I've already read 5 in 2 months.\n\nMost noticeably I've felt less stress about money. I'm getting my normal pay from unemployment, but I'm missing out in spending all that extra money on material good or going out to eat.\n\nI've finally been able to set myself up financially. I'm always i month of rent ahead and I have also been able to put a few thousand dollars into investments. \n\n\nI also feel less stress having to hang out with friends. Before i always wouldn't feel very psyched to hang out with friends because I was so tired. Now I dont have to worry about being tired. Plus my friends and I just chat over the phone. So im.still keeping up without having to maintain a physical presence \n\nI've realized I actually hate my job and am shifting my goals elsewhere.\n\nIdk i mean obviously I haven't been this happy the whole time. But once I realized more and more that this is the new normal for a while it kinda shifted me on from stressing out about the virus, to redirecting me in a different direction in life and making me realize the positives I have to offer as well as the negatives and how I can turn those negatives to positives.\n\nSorry if this was a long read, it just felt really good putting my thoughts into words\n\n**Quick edit: Wow! Wasn't expecting my 1AM word vomit to get so much attention**\n\nFor those of you who are struggling (which simply based off of comments on this post) I know is the majority, I have a favor to ask of you.\n\nToday, I want you to just turn your phone off, turn notifications off and shut that part of your life off. Phones these days are just the harbinger of negative news. Constant Flashing headlines and beeps of negativity. When you are already in a down mindset, having negative things constantly getting shoved in your face is not going to help.\n\nIf you are able, just remove yourself from your phone and get nice and comfortable on a couch or a bed with a cup of tea, coffee, hot chocolate, etc and watch your favorite movie, play your favorite game, or read a book. Remove that negativity and instead replace it with something positive that you know you enjoy. Even if its just for a day, having nothing but positives and relaxation will do wonders for your health. \n\nFor those who are struggling with loved ones who have COVID,  I am so sorry you are going through this right now. I know hopes and prayers are a dumb thing, but given that I'm just a random stranger on reddit, that's all I can give. I will hope and pray that your loved ones make it through.\n\nIf any of you are in an abusive relationship be it family, or a significant other, please understand that you are worth more than that. For some of you I know it is not easy or maybe not even possible to escape that situation right now. But you are worth more than the abuse, be it physiological, mental, or physical. If you are in need of help, use the site below.\n\nIf you have someone who monitors your phone, use incognito mode so it won't show up on search histories.\n\nhttps://www.thehotline.org/",

            "I can relate. \n\nThough I haven't been isolated to my home I have been isolated to my big rig. \n\nLet me explain. \n\nDriving truck always involves alone time but not really alone time because your not the only one on the road. Before the shut down traffic was horrendous at times. The freaking ignorance of other drivers is enough to put a truck driver over the edge. Stress is always at high levels trying to navigate an 80,000 lb 75ft long vehicle, not just around the country but also around ppl that are totally oblivious to their surroundings.  \n\nThese past few weeks with less traffic has made the life of a truck driver alot less stressful, I know I'm much happier for it.\n\nI know we need to reopen the country and get our economy kicked back up, but to be honest I'm not looking forward to the heavy traffic and stress of babysitting ignorant drivers again. Until then I'm going to enjoy the semi(no pun intended) solitude.\n\n\nI'm sincerely hoping that ppl did some serious self-reflection while sitting at home. That they come back a little wiser and more compassionate to others on the road. I know it's wishful thinking for all, but I have faith that some will.",

            "I have social anxiety so of course I feel less anxious and generally happier now. It also helps that I actually have free time and I get to do stuff I want to do. I feel depressed or anxious way less often.\n\nMy only worry is that it will be hell to try to readjust to work when this is over.",
            "Honestly I'm the happiest I've ever been as an adult because of isolation.",
            "Mine has deteriorated. Or atleast ive gotten much fatter.",
            "For me I've always thought of myself as introverted, but at least since mid high-school i've been acting pretty extroverted. I find all of this is nice in a way: not having to interact with so many people every day and all.",
            "I'm loving the lockdown. I love working from home; it save 2 hours and about $7 a day in commuting. I never really noticed, but I give up 3.5 8hr working day of my own time to each fortnight to get to and from work.\n\nI don't have to go out in my free time, I can stay home and play on the computer guilt free.\n\nEven my week pen and paper pathfinder game (like Dungeons and Dragons) is better using using online map, character sheets, ect.",
            "I do feel slightly better overall, but since I can't see my friends I feel lonelier than ever. I have started working out, I have a better relationship with my parents and brother, but I miss my friends and that really brings me down.",
            "Yes!! I had a lot of anxiety before this. Now I love my safe, happy little bubble. I only have to worry about my little nuclear family, no pressure to please anyone else. Part of me never wants this to end.",
            "I was actually in a fairly isolated position in my life for the few months before. When all this hit and a lot of my friends fell into similar positions it became a lot easier to stay connected with them and I now feel a lot less alone.",
            "Fucking damn right. Almost everyone I\u2019ve spoken to prefers it. I was beginning to enrol onto an online CBT eTherapy course right as lockdown started, and I honestly find it difficult to put what I\u2019m learning into practice because I\u2019m not in nearly as much of a bad place as I was a few months ago.\n\nI\u2019m still working but it\u2019s not the same kind of work because we can\u2019t operate the same as we normally would, and the work day isn\u2019t as long so I\u2019m getting a lot more free time.\n\nI\u2019m not a very social person either so there\u2019s no impending worry about social events etc. If I\u2019m honest, I\u2019d prefer this to become the norm.",
            "Mine definitely has. I don't know if it's because of my autism or if it's just better for people in general, but quarnatine is actually treating me great!",
            "Yes I will forever remember this time as a once in a lifetime opportunity to experience being a human instead of a cog in a wheel, to be with your family 24/7 and love it, to have the time to take care of yourself, do fun things. It makes you think how much happier and connected people must\u2019ve been 200 years ago before time with family and fun became a commodity that people couldn\u2019t afford except for two weeks of vacation a year, which, this proves, is not nearly enough. It took 4 weeks just to change mindset and reconnect to the world outside work.",
            "I'm finding life so much easier, working still mostly from home the non commute is giving me back 5 hours a week, even managing to cook every night. My husband who is housebound due to disability definitely happier, it's a win win for me, him and the dogs",
            "I've had a home-office job for over 15 years and I cannot tell you how much I feel better for not having to be out and about in the larger morass of humanity.  \n\nTOO MUCH NOISE.  Not having to be in traffic multiple hours of the day, not even being on the road so I can't be in an accident, less wear/tear on the car, less $$$ for gas, less $$$ for insurance (plus low milage discount).\n\nDon't spend out on food, don't impulse buy b/c I'm just not out.\n\nSounds like I want to be a shut in, but no, it's just peace....\n\nWhen your life is emptied of distractions, yes, life does come into focus.",
            "Quite the opposite, actually. I\u2019ve been having meltdowns at least once a week, my brain\u2019s clouded and I can\u2019t really feel much emotion.\n\nBut I\u2019m glad it\u2019s had a positive effect on someone :D\n\n(That wasn\u2019t meant to sound snarky, sorry if it did XD)",
            "I feel very blessed to be someone who is benefiting from the time off. I started having daily heart palpitations in October. Since I\u2019ve been off work for 2 months they\u2019ve almost stopped completely. Very happy to hear the good coming out of the bad!!",
            "Mine has improved. I gave up drinking and lost weight. I am a very pessimistic person, but this virus has really shown me being negative about everything isn\u2019t healthy and how I impact other people with my negativity.  So I am now doing my best to prepare for what happens next.",
            "I love isolation now. The only thing I really miss is popping into the pub for a pint!\n\nI've been doing gardening a lot and I'm going to be making my first terrarium soon thanks to Secret Santa. \n\nI'll be doing a jigsaw puzzle soon too thanks to another Santa. \n\nI've been throwing myself into baking and cooking new things for me and my partner and I have learned I am a really good cook!\n\nAnd the dog, my world. He has never been happier to have us both home 24/7. Today is his gotcha day. 7 whole years =)",
            "The dissociation was bad briefly, because it was truly hard to imagine that anything was real. School while in quarantine with family was hard because no motivation plus familial obligations.\n\nBut now that all that is over, and I'm tackling a list of things I actually want to do and learn, it feels really nice. I'm realizing I do really well if I create structure for myself and am productive on my own terms. My anxiety is better. \n\nOn the downside, it makes me not look forward to the end of quarantine....",
            "This is the happiest and most financially stable I\u2019ve ever being. Though I\u2019ve been filled with dread the entire time knowing I\u2019ll have to go back to working full time and juggle everything else once again.",
            "I was one of those people whose life didn\u2019t change much during isolation. I would just go to work (till we shut down due to covid-19). I didn\u2019t have much of a social life (by choice), I absolutely love spending time alone, I cook, I read, I binge watch Netflix, I get creative, I sew, I garden. I have a partner but we don\u2019t live together and we\u2019ve had to isolate from each other a few times due to symptoms and exposure risks. So yeah I hear you. Life is great (well, it can be without all the stress we put on ourselves to \u2018keep up\u2019 with everyone.) good luck to you I hope you keep your stress free life. Enjoy.",
            "Same! I have actually realized alot of things about myself than I previously did. Things like - I think during this period I started to love myself even more than I did previously. I was so amazed by that thought that one) I couldn\u2019t stop smiling about it and two) it had me thinking, had I been going on and on with my routine, I wouldn\u2019t have ever paused and had a self-introspection like the way I did in these past months. I think as a person I have grown a lot.\n\nI also realized that sharing both happiness and sadness\u00a0and that sharing some parts of your day either sad or happy, makes quarantine a little better!\nI realized I absolutely suck at carrom, please never have me on your team! \nI realized I love working out as well, and I am working to perfect my handstand (slow process, but getting there)\n\nI realized I absolutely love writing short stories? It started out as a work thing, but then I just fell in love with writing short stories. They are fun and you can always choose what kind of ending you want, and that gives me immense pleasure and power to end the things the way I want. The last time I wrote a short story, it was in Spanish and now I am back to writing some more. \n\nI also started to play my guitar that was left untouched for 5 years now. I am glad, I started it. It\u2019s a little complicated but so is everything that you start at first. I realized I love REDDIT! A LOT. God that app has you deep inside their web.\n\nTrust me there are days where I do nothing and feel bad about \u2018wasting time\u2019 but honestly, that\u2019s okay. I rather stare at the wall for an entire day rather than force myself to do things that I like. Take breaks while you can and whenever you want. Don\u2019t rush into being productive, nobody is keeping a checklist of things you did and did not!\n\nI actually have written a quarantine letter things I have learnt or realized! If anyone wants to read it let me know!!!  Hopefully it will encourage you to write about your quarantine!!",
            "Absolutely not. As a \"key worker\" my mental health has steadily declined to the point where im seriously thinking of just not showing up to my next shift.",
            "It's fantastic that you feel so positive about how lockdown has gone, and frankly I envy that. To be able to self-actualize during a global pandemic is pretty awesome.\n\nI started off very positive with the whole thing, and saw it as a chance to get back to all the things I never have time for; cooking, running, back at my dart board, reading, maybe even finally learning the guitar, who knows?! However, it hasn't worked out like that, as I'm sure it hasn't for many. \n\nMy Dad's been in and out of hospital for 3 months after what was originally a routine shoulder surgery; he's 77 and tested COVID-19 positive 2 weeks ago on top of everything else. He is now testing negative thankfully, however remains in hospital due to complications with the shoulder surgery. I work in insurance, and have been up at 05:30am, unpaid, for the last month, trying to clear backlogs of work as so many staff have been furloughed. It's been one thing after another with work for 2 months now, and is barely showing as a sign of stopping.\n\nBut I feel ok. Not great, not self-actualizing and living my best life by any means, but I'm here. I've not broken down, I've not given up apart from a crate of lager in the bath at the start of April. And therefore I'm stronger than I thought. I suppose that's cool.\n\nSorry, this turned into a ramble about my life. To be able to get as much out of this as you have, though, is utterly fantastic. I also like how you've acknowledged you don't like your job and COVID-19 helped you realise that; too many posts like this are humble-braggy and I think this is a really honest look at how you've done. Keep on keeping on. :)",
            "OMG YES! I did have a low point in quarantine where I hated everyone & myself but now I'm doing so much better on my own. My anxiety is way better now and tbh I really don't give a fuck what people think of me anymore. School isn't stressing me out anymore and I now have a \"hoes mad\" attitude when my family gets mad at me for some bs reason. Quarantine made me cut off toxic or one-sided relationships. Now hopefully I get a glow-up and quarantine would be perfect.",
            "[removed]",
            "Yes, absolutely. I keep reading about how everyone\u2019s mental health is going to decline rapidly as a result of lockdown, and it makes me feel really guilty. Honestly my mental health has never felt better. I am *thriving* during lockdown.",
            "Oh yeah, big time! I\u2019ve been working from home for about 5 years because social noise is difficult for me and I\u2019ve basically been striving for this lockdown type lifestyle anyway. I prefer to have alone time often... socializing once a week or so as long as work wasn\u2019t too stressful. I love all of the delivery services we have now. I love not having a shit ton of social expectations to worry about. I especially love that people don\u2019t just \u201cpop by\u201d anymore!!! \n\nThis has been amazing for my mental health outside of work (work has been a nightmare because I\u2019m in health care). But otherwise, I quite prefer this new normal.",
            "Yes, for sure! Sometimes I feel guilty about it but then I try to remind myself that being guilty instead of taking advantage helps no one.",
            "I love this shit.\n\nI've spent my entire adult life on the hustle. always needing to push to keep things together in between spats of homelessness because I didn't have any support whatsoever. always having to fake happiness outwardly while stringing things together paycheck to paycheck.\n\nnow? I can actually fucking chill for the first time in almost 20 years. I'm not going through internal crisis because I'm not working on lining up my next job, or worrying about being evicted.\n\nI've been lucky enough to start a family in the last couple years, which brought a huge amount of stability to my life, and now I'm just enjoying time with them.\n\nI'm due back to work on June 5th and I'm kind of dreading it.",
            "I noticed this yesterday.  I have been working from home for the past 2 months.  I live alone with my 3 cats, have some social anxiety, and am an introvert.  I have not minded the lockdown at all once we got past the point where I felt like society was not going to collapse.  At first I missed going to my usual Friday night bar and seeing my group of friends.  I missed having something at the end of the week to look forward to.  But that has faded and I'm happy to just be not working on the weekend.  Yesterday I drove 30 minutes to my office to pick up a few things. I realized that the things that working from home helps me avoid like traffic, being around lots of people (elevator, gym, cafeteria, people chewing at their desk), removes me from all the things that piss me off about life.  For me life is so much easier without these minor inconveniences like shitty drivers, people being selfish at the gym, ... I love going to the park at 5pm now to run or do body weight exercises then throwing a lacrosse ball against a brick wall while families and athletes exercise.",
            "Tbh, i feel absolutely no different than before. The only difference is that i can't drink with my friends or do sports. I was an introvert before and still am. No shame.",
            "Definitely. Before lockdown I was burned out, miserable and genuinely didn\u2019t feel like I had any purpose in life. This all went away during lockdown. But now the things that made me feel this way are starting again (school, work etc) and its feels like its declining again.",
            "100% agree and that has also been my experience. I have fleeting moments of missing socializing in person but for the most part this life suits me. No family members using us as a hotel this summer, not having to use our vacation time to visit extended family. I feel calm and weirdly less stressed in many ways.",
            "Yes. There is no pressure to do shit lol not go anywhere, or have to look cute..I just get to chill all day lol",
            "So much, yes. This is the least stressful time I have had since I started working at 16. I have time to do things I enjoy again and I always get to spend time with the dogs now. I actually read a book yesterday, something I haven't really been able to bring myself to do for several years now. I used to read three to five books a week at one point. I have been able to exercise again. I actually sleep and wake up feeling rested. My depression and anxiety, while still there, are at manageable levels for the first time since I can remember. Honestly I don't know how I will be able to return to work again and all that bullshit after this. This is how life should feel, not the hell we have made normal.",
            "I have a ton of anxiety, and have eschewed a lot of social engagements that were \"socially required\" in the past.\n\nI am treating this situation as a total reset. I plan on stepping back into the scene like \"oh hi guys, I was here all along. I'm *just like you*\".",
            "Yeah, that's why I started isolating long before the pandemic.",
            "Yes. I have saved a lot of money and realized I don't even really like going out to eat. I also havent seen any of my friends which I also kind of liked, maybe I'm just turning into a curmudgeon like my dad though. Life is simpler without all the extraneous bullshit. Ill keep like three of those friends be good with that.",
            "Nope. Absolutely not. I am a black hole of depression and anxiety.\n\n But I'm still going to work every day so everything is just additional stress for me",
            "Not for me, it's made my social anxiety way worse and I'm unbelievably lonely at night. I was anxious and lonely before but being away from everyone and not having any opportunities to meet people has totally fucked me",
            "It\u2019s given me a break and I\u2019ve been able to recharge my introverted social batteries",
            "I've just been gardening, drawing, using the internet and occasionally gaming. If I could continue living this way I absolutely would. I'm already worried that I'm now closer to the end of this than I am to the beginning now and every day is bringing me closer to being forced out of home to deal with society again.",
            "The lack of socializing hasn't helped but it's honestly simplified life for me in a way that has allowed me to prioritize the important stuff",
            "I feel like that famous quote from Ferris Beullers Day Off applies here.\n\n\u201cLife moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.\u201d",
            "I was in a very rough spot at school in the weeks before the coronavirus started shutting everything down. I could hardly function, I was crying every day and was telling myself to hold it out until our most important choir event. School shut down the day after our event. \n\nI was still recovering for a few weeks and it took a while for me to feel better again, and at first the isolation really helped me. I was able to relax, I was removed from the sources of my stress. \n\nBut lately I've been really feeling the effects of it. I've been very unmotivated and lethargic. I've been for the most part avoiding my phone because it's been the source of my misery. I'm trying to go outside a little more and when I get home I'm going to try painting and taking the day to myself. \n\nSo it's been both good and bad to my mental health, I suppose.",
            "No. Work usually prevents me from drinking so much",
            "No, not at all. I just wanna leave my house but I can't because of the virus and now I have to deal with my parents being bitchy with me every single time which is seriously making me even more depressed than ever.",
            "No, actually it\u2019s gotten worse for me.\n\nGood for you it\u2019s gotten better.",
            "Nope. Quite the opposite, actually.",
            "I feel great, my stomach issues have gone away as well. I\u2019m quitting my job and moving to the country. Taking this as an eye opening opportunity to change how I live",
            "Absolutely. I work a shitty customer service job at an essential business. Still had to work 40 hours a week but we had very very few guests. In two months I only had one entitled Boomer yell at me. It was really nice while it lasted.",
            "I have felt the opposite. I havent had a single moment to myself since no one leaves my home for more than a few minutes to get groceries. Its driving me up the wall. It is almost never quiet in my home and I get constantly bothered by others in my household knocking on my door to ask me things. I just want to be able to enjoy the freedom of being able to do whatever I want by myself and not feel the pressure of living with another person for a moment. Not even to do anything in particular. Just enjoying a moment of solitude. Usually I'd have about 2 hours to myself when I'd get home from work. Now I have none.\n\nSome people might think I'm being silly or ridiculous, but it is really getting to me, I'm starting to feel like a prisoner in my own home. I even get guilt tripped if I try to go for a walk without inviting anyone.",
            "Opposite for me. Being stuck at home and cut off from my routine has me floundering and my depression has settled in pretty firmly. My self-discipline evaporated, my weight has increased, my motivation vanished, and my energy is non-existent now.\n\nOnce things are \"normal\" I'll be going back to the gym to undo all this damage though. I just gotta hang in there until then.\n\n:(",
            "Yes, it definitely was for me. The first month was difficult and I felt like I hit a low point, but after that, I was able to adjust and focus a lot more on my mental and physical health.",
            "100% yes.  Got to spend heaps more time with my family and enjoy life for what it's supposed to be, without all of the pressures of the modern world.  Helped being in country Australia where we could go out for exercise, we did a lot of nature walks in our local area.",
            "Not having to work has been so much less stressful; I am so relaxed all the time, and I'm getting so much more done. I've started learning a language, I've started studying, and I'm working towards my actual goal job.   \nEven my *boss* isn't really keen to go back to work, honestly. They're enjoying the time off!",
            "reading this made me so happy",
            "This. All of this. I feel you took the words out of my head. I'm honestly dreading going back to the office because I too have realized how much I don't like the people I work with. The job itself is okay, the way the company handles things is not, and the people make it more stressful. I already had these feelings somewhat before the virus, but it showed me just how much I need to move on. \n\nI've also got to spend time with my daughter where we are just chilling. No need to rush here or there. There is time before dinner needs made since we don't have to commute. \n\nI know this virus has been a negative thing for alot of people. But the lifestyle change it has created has some positive points as well.",

            "I\u2019m the exact opposite.",
            "Agree. I'm working from home, don't miss the commute at all. Would like to meet friends in person but can keep in touch so all ok. Snuggling with my husband. Life is good.",
            "I wish I was in your position. My mental health has tanked even worse than it already is. I\u2019ve had a couple of pretty severe mental breakdowns where my bf considered checking me into the hospital. My ptsd has flared up with a vengeance and I can\u2019t escape the nightmares and flashbacks. I get anxiety attacks at the grocery store and I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to turn into an agoraphobic when things do start to open up.",
            "I guess that would make sense for introverts, extroverts on the other hand...",
            "Its not the isolation for me because my state is still pretty open. For me it's being out if school.",
            "Yeah I can say this because I don't need to be stuck in a 2hr traffic with a boiling helmet. I don't need fucking go for office parties and can cook food at my pace and eat tasty things. I can run more during mornings and learn new stuff.\n\nI clearly agree the lockdown has caused calmness and peace in my life.",
            "Nope, Since the quarantine I realized I may have been emotionally traumatized as a child, had a few mental breakdowns, gotten into many fights with my father, lost the gym body I worked my ass off for, missed my friends, lost a few friends, lost my job, had more suicidal ideation than ever before, have seen my ADHD get worse, saw my grades ctumble (still graduated callege) have sort of turned to alcohol as a crutch (since I can't smoke weed now since I need a job) been incredibly bored, been lonely, felt like I'm going crazy, my internal critic has gotten very loud and unbearable and just overall had a shit time. :(",
            "Yeah my anxiety has really decreased. I work full time but live a couple of hours away from my family which means my husband and myself usually spend at least half our weekends a month travelling to see people and i also do a degree so it means not travelling to see people has given me far more time for myself and my anxiety has really decreased.",
            "Yes definitely plus furloughed until the first of July so that\u2019s nice. Me and my mate was talking about this yesterday funnily enough and we both said how stress free we are, mankind aren\u2019t meant to get up to an alarm clock it\u2019s nice to have some down time really",
            "Me too i feel you, i had a burnout right before the lockdown, and my eyes had blood in it, the isolation from everybody and everything helped me with my workaholism and i spend time learning about myself and do more of the thing i used to procrastinate !",
            "I and many that I know have..it seems people have either went crazy or else loved it. Some things I miss of course and it can get a bit samey. \n\nBut in the middle of my working life I've been handed a chance to be a lod again in my home town, spending time with the dog, playing playstation for the first time in years, books as well as home DIY. I live in a rural area and have been able to go to the forest again recently \n\nThe world was slowed down, no distractions, no pressure from the system we exist in that drains the life out of us year in year out. It most certainly left me in a better place going forward .",
            "Yes! Definitely! Before the quarantine I was beyond stressed, had so many things to do and had trouble sleeping. \n\nWith the quarantine it has allowed me to self reflecting, take a breath and once again reconnect with the things I used to love to do. I have found new hobbies, made deeper connections and just found out so much more about myself. \n\nI can honestly see that this quarantine has done wonders for my mental state",
            "Yeah. I feel like a have a heck of a lot more confidence in myself and I'm even thinking of signing up for musical theatre when lockdown is over. \n\nI used to (and still kinda do, though it's got better) have really low self-esteem and wouldn't let anyone hear me sing or play my instruments because I was afraid that they wouldn't like it and I was scared to trying new things incase it went wrong and people would laugh at me. But now I feel like I could do fucking anything, like run to the moon or some ridiculous shit. \n\nI think I'm more confident because I'm only around my family (who accept me for being FtM trans and call me by my preferred name and pronouns) and I don't have to worry about people who don't know I'm trans or having to use the girls bathroom at school and getting weird looks.\n\n\nI've also mysteriously lost weight... Which is also good for self-esteem.",
            "Yes except I'm a uni student",
            "Yes and no. \n\nNo, because some aspects of my mental health have plummeted, but from speaking to my doctor, we think that was going to happen anyway. \n\nBut yes, because I\u2019m less anxious about work. I was furloughed from the shop i work in but I\u2019m still getting a bit of income to put towards my uni fund and I don\u2019t have many bills to worry about because I\u2019m living at home. I took a gap year so I haven\u2019t had to worry about exams and grades being effected. But because of my gap year, and all of my friends going to uni, I don\u2019t really do much other than go to work, go to the gym, and go to the dance studio to train in the evenings (I\u2019m going to uni to dance) and I have no social life. It\u2019s been lonely and depressing and it\u2019s been hard watching all my friends have an amazing time at uni. Now that everyone\u2019s stuck at home, I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m missing anything. Other people are struggling with this massive life change but to me, not much is different. I\u2019m close with my mum so we\u2019ve been able to do more stuff together and I\u2019ve been able to just chill with my dogs and stay up all night and watch the sun come up. I live in a really rural area so going out on walks whenever you want is an option, the weathers been lush recently so I\u2019ve been enjoying the sun, I\u2019m not exactly happy as such but I feel a lot more peaceful now than I did a few months ago before lockdown started.\n\nI\u2019ve put a bit of weight on from being less active but so have a lot of people, and at least I\u2019m trying to change it and lose a few pounds. \n\nHope everyone is staying safe - and sane.",
            "I am forced to socialise more due to the current situation. Being a necessary government employee, I went from 15 hours per week to over 40. \nMy job is fairly easy, so it's not especially stressful, so my depression seems to have receded a bit.",
            "Yes, and no. \n\nIn some respects not being \u2018forced\u2019 to interact with people I just cannot stand in family-social interactions with the \u2018excuse\u2019 of COVID-19 has been nice, it\u2019s been relieving. \n\nOn the other hand, due to my anxiety, and the medications that I take, I often sweat, a lot. So, anytime I go into the public, even only for short periods due to the constraints of COVID-19 I do feel like literally every single person thinks that I\u2019m a carrier for the virus. \n\nMore or less, I find mostly people are either irritating, or somewhat overpowering, so I do prefer when I can avoid people, but I also do need to get out of the house now and then for my own sense of self confidence, and self-worth, because when I\u2019m at home I just think about everything way too much.",

Here is just better than there.\n\nWith Social Isolation my home lifestyle has not remotely changed. Game online, cook for myself, drink beer alone, cope with loneliness by playing female led music, and browse Reddit.",

Instead I found out a couple days ago that that instead of finding herself ahead found someone else. So much for isolation.",

Usually I have a train ride of half an hour and a walk of 15 minutes before getting to the office so it was a really nice moment to read a book, have a walk and really sperate work from private life. Now it actually feels like I'm sleeping at the office. It's harder to make the difference between work and private life even though I go for a walk in the morning and after work. But it's way easier to work overtime and not noticing how much longer you are working. It's getting really unhealthy and I try to draw some boundaries but I'm really craving for that train ride again x_x",
            "It was quite jarring initially but I got comfortable with it after a while. I'm an introvert anyway. The main stress relief was not having to go into the office. It's made me realize that my job does not make me very happy, but taking away the key element of being physically there actually helps. I started doing no-contact baking deliveries to friends, and would wave at them through the door or whatever. It seemed to make people really happy and gave me some level of purpose. I'm now having to go back into the office half the week and I'm finding it really hard, because I liked how I was doing things and getting used to it..\n\nI know a lot of people have commented about weight gain, I've been kinda lucky that I got Invisalign right before this started. It makes it very difficult to boredom eat or eat excessively. Plus, I think we villainize weight gain way too much and need to change our perspective on it.",

            "Absolutely the opposite, I'm more stressed out than before, I can't go to the gym to relax, can't see friends to relax, but my workload at uni is still the same, but now from home without proper help from professors. Meanwhile I'm cooped up in a small house all of the past 2 months, I hate it. I completely understand why we are in quarantine and I agree with it, but I hope we get rid of this virus asap.",

            "Not at all. It's somewhat improving now that the lockdowns are being lifted, but it was pretty bad before that. I used to work out every day, I stopped doing it because I couldn't be arsed. I used to study which I completely stopped doing as well. I started to eat way more shit and overall stopped caring about my health. I also noticed I wasted much more time doing nothing (not like playing videogames or watching series, but outright doing nothing like refreshing reddit every minute). \n\nThankfully I'm getting back to working out and having a healthier diet now.",

            "When discussing with family I\u2019m not joking when I tell them my life has changed very little - other than less shopping and working from home my routine is about the same (I moved for a job, so I\u2019ve yet to establish a social life here, I wasn\u2019t hanging out with anyone. I still only leave the house for hiking with my dog and kayaking). I still have the same amount of chronic depression I had before (15 years of mild-moderate untreated symptoms).\n\nWhat I can say has changed was a major source of stress from one of my coworkers has been relieved - for both of us. She is younger and not in the least emotionally mature, she seems to lack a lot of coping mechanisms, so day to day office stress REALLY gets to her. She has a tendency to project it on to the rest of us in really nasty ways. This work from home situation seems to work really well for her, I\u2019m assuming because she has her own space and flexibility. She only has to \u201cdeal with us\u201d through text and not listen to our \u201cdisrespectful\u201d tones of voices. Especially from me (I\u2019m a direct person, she really doesn\u2019t like my neutral tone or when I set boundaries). \n\nSo our working relationship has only improved, we did some work together yesterday for the first time in a while and it lacked a lot of the broody silence and tense small talk she was doing before (I had one point earned a silent treatment from her). She might be doing some of that female psychological warfare of super sweet to my face and still nasty behind my back, but at this point IDGAF, because our current immediate interactions are much less stressful and I\u2019m too old and busy to care beyond that. She offers help and says thank you, can\u2019t get much better than that for us.",
            "Mine has definitely benefitted. I\u2019ve had plenty of time for self growth and introspection and have really grown as a person. I feel for the first time in a long time that I\u2019m not below the bar with my depression. I am close with my family and have missed them but have also bonded more with my kids and my boyfriend. I have the time to keep my house cleaner and I have time to work on hobbies. It\u2019s been a mostly positive experience!",
            "I've got to agree. I have my own little bevy of issues, but the fact that I can simply take a walk/ride my bike every day has drasti cally improved both my physical and mental health. Walking/cycling while listening to music is like meditation for me, it helps me calm down, gives me ideas, and gives me a break from people. In school, I definitely couldn't take a three mile walk and then go to first period, and by the time I got home, I was too drained for any of that. It's almost ridiculous how much this quarantine has improved my life.",

We play with his favorite toys, get a sun tan in the backyard, and have gotten to explore a lot of the river that runs behind my developing neighborhood.\n\nI\u2019ve gotten to spend so much extra time with my girlfriend, we live together, and honestly feel like we\u2019ve gotten to know each other so much better. We\u2019ve found other things such as board games, card games, sketching, and other arts and crafts stuff to do together. \n\nI just bought a new a construction home right when everything kicked off. I\u2019ve gotten to paint my entire house, build a wooden deck with a pergola on it, put in a fence around my yard, install a bunch of new things, and make a baby room from scratch and get most of what we need.\n\nEveryone seems so much happier in this house with how homey it is now. Work is nice only having to do things 2-3 times a week. Production has gone up for us so it\u2019s a really big eye opener. I actually get to sleep in and not feel like crap being up at 5am for work.

            "A therapist on one of the therapy subreddits said that those with anxiety were the most calm during sessions when those who didn\u2019t were the most erratic. With anxiety, our brains are chaotic always telling ourselves the worst that will happen. When COVID-19 hit, we were the ones that felt like this was our every day. Since COVID-19 didn\u2019t feel any different than normal, many people who deal with GAD actually felt better/thrived during this time whereas people who don\u2019t regularly experience anxiety started to feel as if the life they led before had slipped away overnight and it gave them the worries that many of us with anxiety feel every day. \n\nI hope in a way that this makes people more aware that anxiety is no joke. It can tear away everything. It can make you a shell of who you are or who you want to be and it\u2019s terrifying. It\u2019s nothing to glorify.

It just feels so fucked up that the best thing to happen to my psyche in years is also the worst thing to happen for many others. \n\nI'm just glad to see other privileged people like myself who appreciate how good they have it. I feel like many of the folks around me continue to bitch and complain about haircuts or whatever, completely oblivious to how awesome they have it compared to millions of people around the world right now. \n\nIf you've been impacted by the virus, I give you my deepest sympathies and genuinely hope your troubles are nearing their end. This has been a nightmare for many, and i hope it at least teaches society the lessons needed to ensure everyone is safe and financially secure in the future. I know a random Internet guy's sympathy doesn't mean much, but this virus has been terrible for many and it genuinely breaks my heart to see so many humans left in the dark during the biggest crisis many of us have personally lived through. \n\nIf you're one of the lucky ones though; one of the ones who haven't lost a loved one, aren't struggling financially, haven't been cut off from your circles of support, or any of the other awful experiences many are suffering through right now, i hope you appreciate it. You may not be able to get a hair cut, or might be \"forced\" to wear a mask when you pick up some more snacks at Walmart. But those aren't hardships. They're minor inconveniences, at best, which during a pandemic is about as close to paradise as you're gonna get. I'm sick of seeing people bitch about the small things while others struggle to find rent money or get food in the table, those of us who have it good need to recognize that and be mature about it. Maybe even find a way to spread that well being. \n\nSorry for the rant, but i was happy to see someone being appreciative of their good fortune, and expressing sympathy for those who haven't had it. Typing it out, it seems so simple. But many of our egos and biases have shown brighter through this crisis than our love and compassion for those around us, it was just wonderful to see someone being logical and humble about this whole mess",

Clear sign for me to change my career if I\u2019m honest, it\u2019s given me so much clarity and a new outlook I never would have had without it.",

But the benefits have been that we're getting so much time together as a family we wouldn't normally. Especially my husband and son. Usually during the week, my husband is up and away to get the train at 6.30am and not home until 7pm. But during lockdown he's not been logging in to his system till 9am, so in the morning they go out on their bikes together. And at the end of the day he's out his little room earlier at night. Plus he joins us for lunch and dinner every day. We've also had several major Spring cleans and gotten rid of a lot of clutter and sorted a few unfinished jobs around the house.  I'm pregnant with our second and it's been good for my son to soak up extra time with me before the baby arrives. I do miss my \"me\" time, but on the whole it's not been that bad. I'm a little anxious about leaving our little bubble now to go into hospital, but just hoping that we'll avoid catching anything.",

Lost weight, exercise regularily, eating better and not spending 3.5 to 5 hours traveling to earn shit pay.  Taking some courses since I actually have time and money for basics.  Saving money since I don't have to spend almost 25 percent of my pay on travel.   \n\nI've said it before, for a lot of people that were earning shit pay for their time, this whole pandemic is basically making up for only having maybe 4 vacations in 20 years.

It was an introvert's dream, really.\n\nBut when I stayed inside for ten days straight and the only two people in the world I talk to on occasion stopped communicating over the past two weeks... it really started getting to me. I learned that I can handle only so much lack of contact, even if that means just seeing a few people out and about. \n\nTotal isolation is not for me, and that came as a surprise.",

I\u2019ve even gained a little weight and while I\u2019ve observed it, for once it doesn\u2019t bother me. It seems only natural it would happen as I\u2019m not going as many places, and I\u2019m okay with this.\n\nI also don\u2019t feel so stressed due to hanging out with my friends less - which sounds weird at first glance, but  I\u2019d be so worried about keeping up my appearances that I\u2019d be at the pub nearly every night to see them, only for people to be flaky and drop out at the last minute. It seemed regularly that we\u2019d have (in my opinion) a less-than-satisfying interaction, quickly running out of things to say, like we were hanging out just for the sake of buying a couple of overpriced drinks and to smoke up. \n\nIt\u2019s made me acknowledge that I can let me have more time for myself, and that people aren\u2019t going to dislike or forget me just because I\u2019m not as present as usual. I\u2019ve found it\u2019s worth waiting for a higher quality interaction and it\u2019s nice to be excited for a proper catch-up. I\u2019m really looking forward to being able to have parties again, and for once I don\u2019t feel so anxious at the prospect of \u2018having to show my face\u2019 out of politeness, only to end up going home early anyway because I feel socially exhausted.",

I've been able to deal with (pay someone) to fix the outside of my house (paint, gutters, garden). We apparently spent more than I thought on gas, travel, groceries.\n\nNow that I can visit my mom again - and family - it's been so much less stressful.

            "Sort of? I mean, it's helped me identify what the problems are and given me time to help myself a little. I had a decline in end of march/early april which resulted in a physical crash.

After crawling out of that little hell, I realized that I'm n o t okay and now I know that as soon as quarantine ends, I need to get me a therapist/talk to a doctor or something. I also have the time to actually do self-care shit. I'm a junior in hs, so had school kept going on, I would have just driven myself deeper and deeper down that hole since I'd have no time for anything but schoolwork.

I play roller derby, he's in a band. I own the house and we have 6 animals between us. We had been quietly complaining for like a year that we needed a break. We needed to slow down. We love our friends. I love my team and my sport. He loves playing gigs out. But man, we were WIPED. People made plans that involved us constantly. The derby season was hitting its fever pitch and when I wasn't skating in a game, I was announcing it. There was just no time to do the things we wanted to be doing at home. We had literally one free weekend last summer when he didn't have a gig and I was free and then my mother ended up begging me to look at houses with her 5 hours away.\n\nThe world coming to a screeching halt has given us the break we desperately needed. Has it been easy? No. I had a VERY tough time when this started. But we've finally had a chance to move into every single corner of this house and give it a purpose. I ordered 5 cubic yard of garden soil and it was delivered yesterday. I'm about to get my day started so I can play with my tiller and get my green babies out of the basement greenhouse.\n\nWe talk a lot about how grateful we are for our situation. We're healthy. We're in love. We're philosophically aligned. We have excellent communication skills. We're not easily bored. We're both working. We have plenty to do and a house to craft. By the time things have reached their new normal, all the things we felt we were neglecting will be in good working order but we're also going to be a lot more selfish about our personal time. We love what we have right now and while we miss our friends, we're going to be a lot more kind to ourselves and our schedule.\n\nYou're not alone in using this as a time to check in with yourself and your values.",
            "Same here, my mental health has never been better. I\u2019m paying more attention to myself, engaging in my hobbies, and reflecting on what have been hurting me mentally. In fact, I\u2019m so comfortable being indoors & alone (am isolating alone) that I am a bit worried when everything ends and I HAVE to go out to face the world",
            "The past 2.5~ months have been amazing. Absolutely the best time I\u2019ve ever had at work and subsequently home. I am much, much happier and my temper is much less likely to flare for what I now realize were little things. I don\u2019t spend 2.5 hours on the road everyday or spend the gas on that. I don\u2019t sit in an uncomfortable office for 8 hours. I\u2019m home with my pets and family, surrounded by all the things that make me happy. I\u2019m also more productive at work because I work on the schedule that makes sense for me, not the schedule that got me out the door early enough to deal with my 47 mile drive and traffic and allowed me to be home early enough to actually see my family. I seriously don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to go back to my old unhealthy schedule whenever we eventually have to go back to the office. Luckily we\u2019re still looking at least two months into the future for that and likely longer because my company is being pretty cautious. But someday we\u2019re going to have to go back, and I really do feel stress thinking about that.",

            "Yes, but not weirdly. \n\nI am an introvert by nature, and just as the memes said, staying home away from strangers is the ideal situation for me. \n\nNot to mention that, at school, I was getting a lot of bullying and unwarranted shame. My hate for those individuals was sending me into a downward spiral of aggression. I was barely able to keep myself in check. I honestly don't know what would've happened if I had lost control. Separation from them turned out to be the best solution, and in a matter of days, I felt better than I had in months. \n\nSo, yeah, I love this situation of isolation.

Quarantine gave me the ability to slow down, do a lot of art (and my first online art class), and connect with important people in my life.

            "I'm glad it's worked out well for you; but, for me, it's just the opposite.\n\nSee, I'm an introvert & a loner. I live alone. My therapist is astounded at how comfortable I am at not needing to be around people. My friends are currently all online, because my ten year foray into a personal friendship turned extremely toxic & I had to end it.\n\nI do seek personal companionship, but it's on *my* terms. I participate in family gatherings when one of my cousins has everyone over for a holiday. I'm extremely close with one of my cousins & her husband; & with her mom, my beloved 85+ year old aunt. Before Covid, I saw my cousin monthly for some sort of \"cousin date\", when we'd do something fun, together, like go to a museum, or eat out.\n\nBut this cousin has been taking care of her mom; so has been unwilling to do anything with me other than take me to the store. We are both masked, of course.\n\nAnd, so, I've been in an imposed isolation. My physical disability & never having learned to drive pretty much strands at home. I tried using various ADA transportation alternatives, but I can get flustered easily, &, ultimately, they weren't good for my mental health.\n\nMy mental health agency is also closed; & phone appointments with my therapist aren't nearly as useful as being in his office in person.\n\nEarlier this week, I had a phone appointment with my doctor. I *had* been hoping to get in for a physical (blood work), but the receptionist erred on the side of caution. It was really neat using my phone for a type of Skype! We made an appointment for me to physically go in.\n\nI'm used to going to kfc & eating in the dining room to get out of my apartment. I'm used to being able to sit in a fast food restaurant along my route to catch my breath walking home from the dollar store. I'm used to my caseworker taking me to & from my in person appointment with my therapist, my shrink, or the doctor, & then stopping at a fast food place drive-thru so I can get a feel-good meal.\n\nThat's what maintains my mental health & gets me out of my head; since otherwise, I'm prone to anxiety & depression.\n\nRight now, I'd kill to be able to eat in a sit down restaurant!!!\n\nBut, I'll wait til it's safe to do so; & until my cousin is comfortable doing so.",

            "No, I agree.  I have anxiety, particularly around my coworkers, so working from home instead of being at the office has definitely opened the pressure release valve for me, so to speak.

Definitely not asking for another pandemic.. just wishing that our society would somehow modify working demands to focus more on mental health: 3 or 4 day work weeks, 5-6 hour working days, mandatory shut downs of businesses once a while so we are all have an opportunity to just exist without guilt, shame, or worry.",

They're gorgeous, the longest and strongest they've ever been in my life. \n\nI now realize that it's not my job that stresses me out because I'm still doing it and it's actually harder to do online than in person.

I am able to spend much more time relaxing, doing hobbies, etc. That part is nice. \n\nHurt: I do suffer from anxiety, and while much anxiety has been relieved by working from home, I do have bad days, which I attribute largely to a lack of normal routines. I\u2019ve created as much of a \u201croutine\u201d for myself as I can, but it\u2019s just not the same as non-quarantined life. The anxiety comes in waves, seemingly unprovoked.

It's only by not feeling that way for a few weeks that I even realised how bad I feel as a matter of course in 'normal life'.\n\nThe big question for me now is: what do I do with this information?  The world will go back (at least closer) to how it was.  What changes do I need to make to avoid falling back into that old groove?\n\nSome of the implications of that line of questioning are huge.

I\u2019m a freelancer and most of my projects have been cancelled, but I have one big one that really needed more attention, and I\u2019m now able to give it that. The fact that I STILL feel too busy shows me how incredibly overbooked I was.\n\nI saved quite a bit while I was working like a fiend, so I\u2019m okay for money (ideally I won\u2019t have to dip into my retirement savings, but I\u2019m can get money from the government if I need to so I think I\u2019ll be okay).\n\nI\u2019ve caught up on a ton of small projects around the house. I\u2019ve addressed my addictions and dependencies (28 days sober from alcohol and weed, barely eating sugar). I\u2019ve started a daily yoga practice and realized that I actually enjoy moving my body. I\u2019ve lost a few lbs and just overall feel so much happier.\n\nOh, and a business I ran went under. To be honest it\u2019s a fucking relief. I was running two businesses and it was such a mindfuck going back and forth between them.\n\nI really pray that I am able to live on less money and keep some of this calm going forwards.

I can't believe how much money I was spending on eating out.\n\nI know that it's not something that can last forever, and that there are going to be negative effects from it that are only going to get worse the longer it goes on, but if you have student debt in the US and can afford it, now is the time to be making payments on it.  It all goes towards the principal balance.",
            "I actually found that I enjoy my job, it's just going to the office and having to try to work with my coworkers that I hate. I like most of my coworkers on a personal level. Like, they're mostly ok people to hang around. But I definitely hate working with them. I worked from home for about two months during this whole thing and it was glorious. Music on the stereo, a window (I work in a cube at the office), watching the birds and squirrels and deer out the window while I worked, and not having to hear every conversation going on around me. Unfortunately, my work won't allow me to work from home normally even though we pretty much showed that not only is it easy, it's more productive also. It was so easy to concentrate on my work without 20 other people milling around and coming over to have random conversations with me. My work stress dropped off significantly without having deal with office life.\n\nThe other thing working from home did was save me gas and money. I have a 40 mile round trip to and from work every day and with high Pennsylvania gas prices and now prices heading back up already, it gets expensive. I do like to drive though, so without spending all that time and money on driving to and from work I was able to go out for evening drives a few times a week. Sometimes in to the city, sometimes the country, sometimes I just flip a coin at stop signs and red lights to decide which way to turn. I'd forgotten how much I loved just going for drives with nowhere to go.\n\nI definitely miss going places and hanging out with my friends, but I've managed to keep myself busy during lock down so it hasn't been too bad. I usually cook for myself (I like to cook), but I've been doing takeout from local places a good bit lately just for something different. There's been a good influx of new restaurants in my area the last few years that I've always wanted to try but never have, so I've been getting takeout from them now and have found that there's some pretty damn good places to eat in my own neighborhood.\n\nLess stress, new experiences (even if they're just trying new restaurants), and reconnecting with things I used to enjoy have all contributed to making me happier and giving me a more positive attitude. Unfortunately, I had to start back to work in the office week before last. I felt the negativity and depression set back in almost immediately. I was getting some work done on projects around the house while working from home. Now by the time I get home from work I'm so mentally exhausted from all the office bullshit that I'm back to just not wanting to do anything. I work for a pretty good company (good benefits, job security, ok pay), but I've been thinking seriously about looking for a new job with more flexibility to work from home. I don't know. We'll see.",

She had a small side business on line and was spending more time with that and it was starting to do well and she may not go back to her bar tender job.\n\nOne friend worked at a call center and had to work from home.  Very soon they were suppose to move back to the office. He talked to his bosses and said he wanted to retire next month and asked if he could continue working from home and they agreed.\n\nNobody is missing those time eathing commutes to and from work.",

            "I feel guilty for how much I\u2019ve been thriving during lockdown. I would describe myself as a social introvert, so I definitely miss people, but I live with my S.O. and that helps stave off loneliness greatly. \n\nLockdown has pulled back the curtain on all the things I said I would do when I had more time. Once I put my mind to doing those things I have been grabbing life by the balls. I am speaking pretty food Spanish, reading a lot, cooking like crazy, exercising every day, creating something new each day, all because of goals I set that I had always resisted setting before. \n\nI feel guilty because I know so many people are sincerely struggling with this, and for a lot of them there\u2019s probably no way around it. I can\u2019t imagine being single right now, for example, and trying to take social distancing seriously while still having the need for physical touch from other humans. That would be pretty unbearable for me. My heart goes out to those who are struggling!",

I\u2019m not buying online as much as I predicted, and I\u2019m able to save a lot by cooking everything in my kitchen. Some meals are more struggle than others but that\u2019s okay.

I prefer staying home, playing video games and keeping to myself. So you would think the self isolation would be good right ?\n\n2. My gf of 3 years left me in February. I had no idea it was coming. Yes I wasnt in the best state of mind( see point 3). I offered to work on our relationship, but she didnt want to.\n\n3. I have been struggling to find work. My last job was a contract position that ended mid December. Took the holidays off, then looked for work in the new year. Didnt get any call backs from anything I applied for, then in late March early April I finally received an offer. A week before my start date, they told me they needed to push it back due to the possibility of quarantine  ( British Columbia, Canada).

            "In the beginning my mental health went down the toilet. I was so sad from losing my job, living alone, and gaining weight. But thankfully things have turned around for me. Having no job right now means I have time to go for walks mid-day and enjoy the weather, facetime friends whenever we\u2019re bored, spend extra time making and trying healthy foods, watch movies and shows I haven\u2019t had time for, etc. Sometimes I panic about the future and finding a new job but I am trying to enjoy life one day at a time.",
            "Not at all",
            "I\u2019m personally having the best time of my life. My dream was to have remote WFH, and now I am forced to. (I work in SF Bay tech). I was denied a sabbatical request before this Covid crap, but I basically got one in a roundabout way. \n\nI am so introverted that the most social I am was simply showing up to the office for work. Between the commute, open office environment, sidestepping shit & needles daily, I didn\u2019t realize just how much external stress I was having to manage just so I could feel my life was \u201csimple\u201d. \n\nOnce we went SIP all the external distractions were removed, and I was able to go inward. I have never been this aligned between mind, body, and energy in my life. Physically I have been bodybuilding for 7 years and currently I am the most lean, jacked and strong I have ever been. \n\nThe pile of books I always intended to read has become smaller, and I am learning so much during this time that I always \u201cwanted\u201d to. Before Covid most of my time was spent managing basic life maintenance. Then I would be too tired to pursue anything else. Weekends used blow by in a blink, and I would feel all I got done was laundry.\n\nI am aware most people out there are suffering, including many of my close friends and family. Everyone needs to take control of their mental health if they can, or choose to continue to live inside the cage of their minds. Seek professional help, talk to someone- many people are going through it. Feeling alone or out of control is just that, a feeling. Like all feelings they pass.",
            "mine hasn\u2019t because i\u2019m stuck with my toxic family. but they\u2019re finalllly going to work on monday and i\u2019m really excited to finally be away from them lol",
            "Dude, it\u2019s been the exact same for me. During the school year I\u2019d be constantly stressed out from having to go in every day and face things that were major stressors for me. I won\u2019t waste time going deep into it, but sometimes I\u2019d get suicidal from the daily stress those things at school caused me.\n\nNow that I spend almost all my time at home and do nearly everything at home, I feel so much better. I\u2019m away from my stressors, and I can do everything at my own pace and keep my own schedule, instead of trying to follow the schedule and pace that school gave me. Before, literally the smallest thing could send me into a really dark mood, and I\u2019d feel totally hopeless and believe that dying to escape the pain was preferable to trying to make it through. Even just a small setback, like a slightly difficult assignment, would be able to do this to me before. Now, I can barely finish something on time because it was way harder and longer than I thought it would be, and it doesn\u2019t dominate my mind and mood anymore. Sure it stresses me out, but once I\u2019m done the stress is gone, as opposed to before when it used to linger. So rarely does a dark mood take me over anymore, and when one does it\u2019s very short-lived, as opposed to how I used to be, getting dark moods at least twice a week and them lasting for hours. This quarantine has been a totally absolute blessing for my mental health.\n\nI don\u2019t wish for it to go on, simply because of how damaging it is for so many and to our economy and society as a whole. But I can\u2019t deny that this way of life has been absolutely amazing for me, and that I\u2019ll probably hate having to go back to normal.",
            "Yes. \n\nI feel like I ruined a once in a lifetime opportunity to take 1-3 months off work, and get paid twice as much for it cause unemployment is more than I'd get paid working 50 hour weeks.  I've been working the last two months and have made half what my furloughed roommate/coworker who was in the same position I was in because they had their parents to cover bills while this all blew over. We had the choice from our employer to stop coming in until this is all over, unpaid of course. I couldn't afford to not have some kind of paycheck coming In so I stayed and got to pick up extra hours from those who left. \n\nFor someone making barely 1000 a month, an entire month or more off, with more than double the income I'm used to? That can literally be life changing. \n\nSo yeah I hate everything right now. Fuck this whole system. I wish my boss would fire me every day I go in. Or at least schedule me less hours so I could qualify for unemployment. But nope, I'll get all the hours for a couple hundred a week after taxes, and some can take the month off for twice that much",

If it's just to vent because the relationship is too weird or to \"clear the air\" then it might be good to bring it up but more with the goal of forgiveness. The idea here is to focus on the now and explain why you feel this way and just wanted to say \"I forgive you, let's start over\" rather than stirring up old stuff and make the other person feel bad.\n\nWhatever you end up doing should reflect you and what you want.

Def don\u2019t *confront* him, but if you wanted to remind him of who he was in a way that is not confrontational and no one else would understand, *after* your working relationship is already functioning well, I would say more power to you.\n\nThe reasons not to are sound: you don\u2019t want to stir up conflict at work, out him to the entire workplace, or turn the tables and become the bully.

            "Clinical addiction usually implies some type of self-destructive and self-harming behavior. You drink so much, that you lose your job and alienate all of your friends. You gamble so much that you blow away your life savings. You do so many drugs that you a rotting away your teeth and causing other ill health effects.\n\nIf you save a lot of money, but don't actually suffer as a result, then it is not problematic. There are certainly some people like hoarders where collecting items becomes problematic. If someone is so cheap that they practically starve themselves instead of buying food, that is a problem. However, saving money and being perfectly fine in all other parts of life is not a problem.",
            "There really isn't other than politicization and subsequent public perception of addiction. Dr. Gabor Mat\u00e9 is a great resource for this. He states in his book, \"In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts,\" that we can be addicted to just about anything. Sex, money, food, work, shopping, drugs, technology, even something like listening to music (sounds strange, but the way he describes his addiction to classical music is compelling). If it impedes on your relationships and ability to function in society, it's an addiction, no matter the substance. And it's a very natural and human process. It's only bc of the way we've politicized drugs that we've narrowed addiction down to a few mind-altering substances.\n\nSource: Am anthropologist specialized in critical drug & addiction studies.",
            "Therapist here. This is an interesting question! When we think about what constitutes a mental illness, we need to consider the [\"Four D's\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathology#The_four_Ds) of psychopathology: deviance, distress, dysfunction, and danger.\n\n* Deviance refers to thoughts, behaviors and emotions that are considered unacceptable or not common in society. Amassing wealth is generally something that is encouraged in capitalist societies, so it would likely not be considered deviant (although extreme acts of greed might qualify).\n* Distress refers to the negative emotions experienced by the individual. If the individual experiences distress about their drive to collect money, this might qualify.\n* Dysfunction refers to maladaptive behaviors that impair the individuals ability to live a normal, healthy life. If the act of amassing wealth is causing dysfunction in their lives, this might qualify.\n* Danger refers to behaviors that threaten the safety of the individual or of others. If the individual is engaging in risky behaviors for money, or if they're putting others in danger, than this might qualify.\n\nSo as you can see, simply possessing a large amount of wealth isn't enough to be a mental illness - although the behaviors associated with *acquiring* wealth can absolutely be pathological. A workaholic who ignores their family and personal health to further their career, an extreme miser who lives in poverty in order to pinch pennies, or a tyrant who abuses others to maximize profit could all be examples of people who have pathological relationships with money.\n\nSo why isn't there a diagnosis for this behavior? That's a little more complicated. \"Addiction\" is an often overused word, and the boards who write the Diagnostic Statistical Manual (DSM) are pretty strict about what they will consider a diagnosable addiction. The only behavioral addiction in the DSM 5 is currently \"gambling addiction\"; others that are in consideration are \"gaming addiction\", \"internet addiction\", \"sex addiction\", but none of those have made the cut yet. \"Money addiction\" is such a loaded concept that I think it's unlikely it would ever be added.\n\nWhat about hoarding? Well, hoarding primarily describes the acquisition of (and difficulty letting go of) possessions that take up space. When the sheer volume of possessions that you own makes it difficult or impossible to function in your house, but you still can't get rid of them. Unless someone is living like Scrouge McDuck with a giant pile of gold coins in their house, simply having more money than you need is not enough to qualify for hoarding.\n\nI think there should probably be a specific diagnoses that describes the obsessive accumulation of wealth, but there's many different ways to conceptualize why a person might engage in that behavior. Regardless of how we label it, a good therapist should be able to recognize when this behavior is problematic and come up with a plan to try and work on it.",
            "Easy. Many addictions aren't seen as mental illness. I get the narrative, but it doesn't really track in this case.\n\nThat being said, for most addictions to really count as a clinical problem, it needs to negatively impact ones life. When the drive for wealth or success does so and they are either self-aware enough or have people around them that care, they do get help. Fun fact, it's really not uncommon for CEOs and other magnates to go to therapy.",
            "Because at a certain point, it's not something they actively *do* anymore.  When you hear about Jeff Bezos's wealth going up, for example, that is almost entirely controlled by the price of AMZN stock, which makes up like 95% of his wealth.  He has no direct control over that, beyond doing his best to make Amazon a place where lots of people buy things, which in turn makes lots of people want to invest in the stock.  And now that he's retired, he basically now has NO control over that.  AMZN, and therefore his net worth, will rise and fall independent of anything he actually does from here on out.\n\nHe's not sitting there thinking to himself, \"omg, I need more money, I need more money, I need more money.\"  He started a company, made that company *wildly* successful, and the wealth naturally followed.",
            "The world's richest people aren't obsessively hoarding it, they just own a large enough share of a company that grew large enough that they happen to have a high net worth. Sure, they had to go and start a company in the first place, but the extreme levels of wealth just kinda happened to them when other people bought the shares. They're the lottery winners of business owners. So there's not necessarily a problematic behavior or a treatable illness associated with their wealth. \n\nImagine if you bought a house and just lived in it. One day, the housing market goes crazy, and the one next door sells for five million. Suddenly your house is worth five million and so are you, but nothing about you contributed to that valuation except that you bought a house some time ago. If your house was suddenly worth ten billion, it wouldn't change the person you are.",

            "The accumulation of resources is a natural drive in all creatures.\n\nIt doesnt mean it doesnt harm those around you and the world at large to have people horde wealth but it doesnt mean theres something neccessarily wrong with that person.\n\nAlso theres generally a involuntary compulsion involved with addiction. \n\nI think this falls very much into the \"rich = bad\" way of thinking in that its poorly thought out and bases everything around the idea of wealth is wrong not the systems people gather wealth within.",
            "This is an interesting idea. \"Addiction\" is narrowly defined to include only harm to the self, I think.\n\nAn addiction that hurts everyone but the self would be an interesting case.\n\nYou're onto something, though. Addiction to money and wealth for their own sakes is definitely destructive and should be cured as a disease. It siphons money and value from society and sequesters it under one person's ownership. It then does nothing for anyone.",
            "Why would it be seen as a mental illness? \n\nHere are two scenarios, you tell me which one is mentally ill.\n\n1. Person A works 40-60 hours a week, is really good at their job and does well socially. \n2. Person B works 40-60 hours a week, is really good at their job and does well socially. \n\nOne is a billionaire, the other is just getting by. Which one is mentally ill and why?",
            "I'm wondering at what point do we consider it an addiction?\n\nI know two people who work 60 hours a week, and their family is a-okay with it. I wouldn't consider this addictive behavior. But what if the spouse of one of them disagrees and divorces the husband for not being around enough? Does it become an addiction because it ruined their marriage, but then what about the couple that makes it work?\n\nThat said, I know 1 person who probably spends 50 hours at their regular job, and 20 hours on their side hustle, and is doing a Masters just to get paid more at their first job. There's probably only 2 hours in each day which he takes a break for himself to watch TV. His motivator? Money. This dude has a problem, and then wonders why he can't keep a girl.",
            "maybe it is but no one is really hoarding money/wealth?\n\nscrooge mc duck with a skyscraper full of money is fictional.  no one with that much wealth would do that and not get even savings account interest on it.\n\nand people like jeff bezos, despite the popular conception he doesn't have that much money, his wealth is primarily his ownership stake in amazon the company he founded.  and it's the opposite of hoarded.  it's out in the world being productive delivering value to customers.",
            "Making money isn't inherently bad. We don't really worry about addiction to things that aren't bad. If someone is addicted to exercise or healthy foods, nobody cares.",
            "We have something like that, it's called workoholism. Addiction to workohol.",
            "Because ego and vanity is promoted in this world above all, including morality. Addiction to other things is only looked down on if it isn't monetarily profitable for you and your circle of friends and family. If someone pops adderall daily and is productive nobody is going to care about the details if they look happy and successful on the outside. It's kind of dark how that works. There are things that calm a persons soul more than any amount of money that costs little to no money but it's all a matter of what others find acceptable. Often times i think human beings become absorbed with what others think and never find a way out of that rabbit hole.",
            "What is termed \"mental illness\" is determined by society and culture. There are some cultures in which people who have hallucinations are seen as having insight into the paranormal. Of course, those are usually people who induce an altered state rather than having one come upon them. I also hold the opinion that people who were prone to murdering/harming others likely  had an outlet for their tendencies in the distant past. Imagine how useful being sadistic/violent was for certain roles (soldiers, mercenaries, etc.) as being uninhibited in this respect would have been very useful for certain types of societies.\n\nSince current society values wealth more than anything (arguably), stepping all over others, taking and never giving, and harming the environment/society to gain wealth isn't seen as a mental illness. It's barely seen as toxic by most people. I've seen many people who think it's \"smart\" to be a dick to others if it gets you money. There was a time when avarice was seen as a bad thing and when people who made money through manipulation of money (e.g., usury) were seen as bad people, but those are not the times we live in.",

            "If you're talking about billionaires, they're not really hoarding wealth. It passively goes up with the value of their stock holdings. For some people like Jeff Bezos, they wouldn't be able to ever feasibly give away more money than they make, as liquidating billions of dollars of stock doesn't happen overnight, it's a long process. And in that time, he's gained many more billions",
            "Society itself is sick and enables their addiction. Those with the illness control everyone who values money more than human relationships. \n\nProfessionals just do what people pay them to do. So \"mental health professionals\" are just people who enable certain types of illness over others.",

            "There's actually something interesting going on in this space. I'm studying games, and the WHO has a classification for game addiction. It is one of only two behavioral addictions. The other being gambling. The other form of addiction of course being substances.\n\nSo why are those the only two behavioral addictions? Here's the definition:\n\n> ... characterized by impaired control over gaming, increasing priority given to gaming over other activities to the extent that gaming takes precedence over other interests and daily activities, and continuation or escalation of gaming despite the occurrence of negative consequences. ([Source](https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/addictive-behaviours-gaming-disorder))\n\n* You can have impaired over anything.\n* You can increase priority of any behavior.\n* You can continue escalating anything.\n\nSome scholars are trying to fight back, but it is very clear that this is heavily biased by the public and politics. There's literally no other reason that there shouldn't be a general behavioral addiction, rather than specifically gambling and gaming. It's stupid and should change.",

            "I see the point that OP is trying to make, but I think a lot of people are interpreting it differently. When I think of someone who could fall under the category of \u201caddicted\u201d to making money, I think of my sister. She would definitely fall under the destructive/self-harm type. She is so focused on money that she won\u2019t forego it even though she\u2019s aware of the damage it\u2019s bringing to her life. \n\nShe works as a chemist at a nuclear power plant making more money than she could ever make with the degree that she has, and she is completely aware of that. She claims the job is so easy that a monkey could do it (mind you, she is in the top 99th percentile of IQ, so everything is \u201ceasy\u201d to her). On top of this, she lives in a mid-west state that is incredibly dull and non-diverse, which is definitely not great for someone who needs a lot of mental stimulant to be entertained/engaged. \n\nAnyway, the job is incredibly easy and she makes a ton of money doing virtually nothing through out the day. However, she HATES everyone she works with. Yes, hate. So much so that she goes to therapy over it. She has been at this job for years now. \n\nShe claims she can\u2019t bring herself to leave the job, no matter how unhappy and miserable it makes her, because of the amount of money she makes. And truthfully, I don\u2019t see her ever leaving unless she was fired. It\u2019s heartbreaking because she\u2019s so brilliant and could be doing so much more for herself if she wasn\u2019t so focused on money. \n\nTo me, that is self-destructive.",

In general our approach to mental health is to sell or buy, through \u201ctherapy\u201d or \u201cself-care,\u201d solutions to problems that were caused by life under late capitalism in the first place.\n\nIn other words, clinical psychology is tolerated by neoliberal orthodoxy because it serves as a palliative and helps maintain the illusion that ours is not a broken system.

It\u2019s like that one quote: \u201cIf a monkey hoarded more bananas than it could eat, while most of the other monkeys starved, scientists would study that monkey to figure out what the heck was wrong with it. When humans do it, we put them on the cover of Forbes.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve normalized it as being acceptable when in reality they are hoarding resources from others that they desperately need, not to mention they use their wealthy to bribe the people that can make them get help(government taxes) into giving them breaks so that they can keep their addiction going. It\u2019s real sad and sadistic that these people have gotten so addicted to the idea that they need to get richer even at the cost of others lives and well being, just chasing that high of another billion in the bank that they\u2019ll hoard and just let sit there.",

            "Answer: Because here in America, we've been raised to worship \"successful businessmen.\"   We're the land of entrepreneurs, of self-made millionaires, of get-rich-quick. \n\nSo when we encounter someone like the Koch Brothers, Robert Mercer, or any of these other billionaires, our reflex is to admire them.   \n\nOur reflex is also to think \"why don't they have a right to their money, if I had a ton of money, I'd want to enjoy it!\"\n\nBut what we don't tend to realize is that these guys are rich beyond anything that any normal person can conceive of.  These guys have palatial homes the size of hotels, and dozens of them, all filled with hugely expensive decor and the exact duplicates of all their clothes.  They do things like Aristotle Onassis having dinner on his yacht--he had an exact same dinner being served below deck, to an empty table, just so that \"in case\" it rained, his guests could just move to the other table and be at the same point in their meal.  (The second meal would just be thrown out if it didn't rain.)   They compete for who has the biggest yacht--to the point that the ultra-wealthy billionaire who built the Biggest Yacht has to dock at a commercial dock with container ships because it's too big to dock anywhere else.   \n\nWhat I'm saying is they have stupid money, excessive money, and they use it in ways that are actually heartless.  \n\nEven worse, a lot of them throw billions around to interfere with politics--politics that will favor THEM, lower their tax rates, get politicians to lie about climate change so they can continue to sell oil, \n\nMy point being, they're not using their money for good, in most cases. \n\nSecondly, they tend to GET their money on the backs of the rest of us.   I mean, I don't mind that Jeff Bezos had the vision and the drive to start with a $10K loan and a garage, selling books online, and built that into a phenomenal global conglomerate that creates entertainment, streams it, and sells everything from avocados to computers.   \n\nBut I DO mind that one of the reasons he's so extremely wealthy is because he brutally underpays and overworks his work force.  I DO mind that he could help mitigate some of the poverty his own work force falls into, and help the country as a whole, but instead he spends it on a spaceship. I DO mind that he pays so little in taxes, that the rest of us have to make up the difference.\n\nLikewise--the Walton family underpays their Walmart employees to the point where they have to rely on food stamps and Medicaid--that is, they're outsourcing their labor costs to American taxpayers, not to mention how many of their goods they source from sweatshops overseas.   \n\nThese ruthless businessmen could easily pay living wages, and work to have a healthy workforce, and help Americans to be strong and productive, but instead they hoard all the money for themselves, and then use it to harm us politically. \n\nThey also generally lay waste to their relationships, their marriages, their relationships with their children, since they're on an endless quest for more, more, more.   \n\nJust like an addict.  \n\nSo I think it correctly can be considered an addiction--in that it harms them (as they become self-destructively ruthless), and it harms everyone around them as well.  \n\nAnd I think if we were able to understand it like that, instead of admiring it, we would be able to corral it better.  We would be able as a country to ask them to pay their fair share of taxes, so we don't have to bear the burden, and so that our schools, roads, and public services can be funded.   We would be able to insist that they pay a living wage to their work force.  \n\nWe're not asking them to give up being rich.  We're just saying that maybe there isn't any real difference between 50 billion and 49 billion, to them, but it would make a huge difference to the world.",
