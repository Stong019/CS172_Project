            "an NFT is like someone giving you the receipt that says that a beanie baby attached to that receipt exists.",
            "No...\n\nBecause at the end of the day is you bought a beenie baby you have a beanie baby, but if you buy an NFT all you have is a certificate.",
            "[deleted]",
            "Unrelated, but why didn't Beanie Babies blow up in value and never really went anywhere? I figured they'd have collector value, given it's a physical item and there are many different variations. Not to mention some can be quite old.",
            "Not an NTF, but similiar to Beanie Babies... Coca Cola themed items, bottles, etc. Especially special edition/holiday bottles.\n\nWhen I was little my dad was convinced Weebles would be worth a lot in the future. I remember we had tons of those, not sure if people still collect them or not though.\n\nEdit: Pokemon and Yu Gi-Oh cards",
            "An NFT is a non fungible token. It is a crypto currency. \n\nTo define non fungible let\u2019s define fungible. A fungible currency is one in which each unit of currency is the same. For example I have $1 you have $1 if we trade dollars we both have $1 and for all intents and purposes they are the same. Similarly with Bitcoin. If I trade you one of my bitcoins for one of your bitcoins they are both the same thing. \n\nA non fungible is when you have two things that are not the same. For example you and I both have a dog. But if I trade your dog for mine Then the trade isn\u2019t the same my dog is MY dog and is not equivalent to your dog. \n\nNow let\u2019s talk NFTs as they stand today. They are often used as proof of ownership of a digital good. Often art is the common example, in which you buy the original of a piece of digital art and the NFT is proof of ownership. While art and money laundering and rich getting richer is a cynical but valid take. However the notion of a digital certificate that is completely unique is definitely very useful from a tracking perspective be it for ownership of property, or other large assets. Having an open source digital repository of ownership could be great for accountability and tracking. Again authenticity is more typical in luxury items so one could use the NFT and associated meta data to have a transparent history of the goods over time eg this Rolex was shipped from the facotry, to a store in NY and now it is in your name as the buyer. \n\nAnother potential use case is in gaming to combat duplicate items. Given NFTs limited supply and unique nature. NFTs May solve that by giving custom or rare items NFT status. \n\nNow while NFTs May not be the best answer in all these use cases it is still an emerging technology that has some quirks to be worked out. I think of nothing else it is another tool in developers tool box when it comes to solving problems. Just like how a hammer might be able to fasten two board together we also have screws, joints, and rivets.\n\nEdit:\n\nAn additional thought in relation to NFTs re: digital goods. \n\nOften when you buy a digital product eg a video game on steam, or a song on iTunes you do not own the item. You are buying a license to play the song through the provider. This means if the service vanishes tomorrow so do your rights and support for the game. Your rights are at the mercy of Steam, Apple, Google etc. however if every time you bought a digital product you received an NFT you would actually be the legal, traceable owner of the product. This would intrinsically give you more rights over the product thanks to you now being the owner. This would then (region depending) give you certain entitlements in relation to longevity, and support for the product. \n\nAgain NFTs definitely are not the only way to solve this problem or any other problem I mentioned but as stated before it is another tool in the toolbox which may suit in the right circumstance. \n\nI have worked with NFTs, Crypto and smart contracts in the past and would be happy to add to this or answer any questions.",
            "Unlike gold, or beanie babies, NFT's have no intrinsic value.  There's nothing you can \"do\" with them, other than launder your crypto, which is the primary reason they exist.",
            "NFTs are an attempt at digital scarcity.  Raises questions about art and ownership in the digital world.  It also cuts out the middleman between the artist and the art consumer/collector.  At the moment NFT mostly seem to be used for visual art, but the technology doesn't have to be limited there.  NFTs could be applied to a variety of digital assets like music, video games, movies.  An artist can directly sell their art to the consumer and profits off of future transaction of their art if traded again.",
            "NFTs are like the email receipt that you own that Beanie Baby you bought but your kid took it to daycare and it got thrown into the toy box and all the kids play with it, but you still have the receipt stating you're the owner of the beanie baby.",
            "For now? Yes. In the near future? Not so much.\n\nThink about this: When you buy a video game these days, you are usually doing so without a physical disk. You are simply paying for a digital license, and that license is held and administered by the merchant (Steam, Sony, etc). You used to own a physical copy of the game on a disc or cartridge that you could play any time as long as you have the proper hardware. You could sell that game when you were done or if you decided it wasn't for you. \n\nSo if, today, a video game license were to be distributed as an NFT, how would you \"owning\" a game on Microsoft or Sony's servers be any different than an NFT? Outside of one license being held on an immutable public ledger and the other by a single party that has financial interest in maintaining absolute control.\n\nNFT also opens the door to reselling digital assets. If you play a game and finish it, you could resell it. Not only that, but NFTs provide a method to cycle royalties to the creator on the sale of used games. This has been a locked-off market to the real creators until now.\n\nNFTs can also represent in-game items. In MMOs like WoW, there have been vibrant in-game marketplaces and economies for YEARS now. Gold farming, full account sales, flipping items, people have been making real FIAT money for digital goods for a long time now. The only difference now is that, instead of these balances being held on a private server, they are held in the blockchain, providing a public method to certify provenance in perpetuity.\n\nThis is just one market where NFTs stand to change the way the market operates as a whole. Think about the other places where having an immutable public ledger that can certify ownership would be useful. Stock in a company could be issued as NFTs, for one. There is so much that happens behind closed doors in our financial securities system, and blockchain stands to bring all that into the daylight.\n\nNFT is an exciting technology but it is incredibly young. People are just confused about what it is. Speculative investment in NFT is a fool's game right now in my opinion; this aspect is absolutely Beanie Baby-esque, but that doesn't mean that the underlying technology is without merit.",
            "Well, if value isn\u2019t decided by what most people will pay for it, what is it decided on then? My phone might *actually* be worth $50 but I bought it for $700, everyone else who bought it also bought it for $700, so it has a value of $700",
            "We are literally making shit up to waste our money on.",
            "Kind of like high-end art. The people who buy it and to an extent the action platform dictate the price. They really have no intrinsic value, at least beanie babies can claim material cost as a base level.",
            "We arbitrarily assign value to everything.",
            "Yes but that\u2019s basically how the economy works. Money has value because people think it has value. NFTs will have value as long as there are people who think they have value",
            "Big difference is that beanie babies were made by one company, whereas NFT can be made by anyone. There isn\u2019t one guy that can just decide how many NFTs get made one day.",
            "NFTs are GROSSLY misrepresented in their potential right now.\n\nPeople are going wild over these silly pictures that artists are whipping up.\n\nWhat the real potential taps into is digital trading cards that have actual scarcity. In game tradeable items that ONLY you own. And the list goes on from there.\n\nEven aside from recreation, think of property ownership. You can \u201ctokenize\u201d your assets. Think of cars or real estate. Instead of having a paper deed or title, you can own the NFT which holds all the ownership and registration details. Passing ownership along to someone else is as simple as \u201cgiving\u201d the token to someone else.\n\nWe are just hardly, BARELY, scraping the surface of the potential for NFTs",
            "NFTs are complicated. \n\nRight now, yes, they're basically all beanie babies - in fact, probably worth less than beanie babies, as they don't even have a physical footprint. They're a bonafide scam. \n\nThe *real* big thing about NFTs is their potential, not their current use - NFTs could allow resale of digital games and assets as if they were physical ones, and could even send a bonus back to the original devs/artists upon trading. It'd be a big step forward for a few entertainment industries and would help cut down on the amount of abusive publishers and labels out there by allowing more ease of access to revenue from sales.\n\n...probably not gonna be a thing for a few more years though, so for now, yes, your understanding is basically correct. Stay away from NFTs.",
            "Nfts are stupid",
            "They are like if beanie babies were attached to planet destroying machines.  NFTs and cryptocurrencies consume more electricity than entire countries.\n\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/nfts-hot-effect-earth-climate/",
            "It's just like art. Just another way for rich people to launder money.",
            "Pretty much. That's not actually as big a problem as people think though. \n\nWhat gives a dollar bill value? The paper? The ink? The little strip inside? It's the collective agreement and use of it around the country and world. That's it. Because it's used and we say X dollars buys Y product, it retains that value. Exactly the same thing just more credibility and adoption. \n\nIt goes further though. What about debt? Why is that something we pay? Is that business or bank or person benefitting today from money we owe later? No, not really. It becomes an imaginary branching stack. 5 people owe 50k to a business, that business can spend 250k now and have that debt to a supplier. Which goes on to buy the things that keep them operating, accruing more debt. So where's the original money? Is Amazon operating off the billions we're buying today for things they'll do in a year? Kinda. But yes it goes even further. What if we don't pay? Say you go broke and declare bankruptcy and you don't owe that anymore. Does Amazon get hurt? No of course not. Not because of scale (that's a mental trap argued by some in finance). They don't just absorb your disappearing debt, if it's significant they'll get it from passing it onto their taxes in the form of tax breaks. So where does THAT come from then? The government just doesn't take those taxes and either prints more money (which has no source, just literally increasing the supply until the amount is offset by the new amount in existence) or it increases the government debt. So where does that come from? Last one I promise. It borrows from future GDP. So if we produce 20 trillion in a given year you say \"well 2 trillion of 2028 belongs to 2021 now\" and write it up as a debt. \n\nIt's completely imaginary. How do you determine future GDP that hasn't happened? You just make it up based on prior performance. So in 2028 do we cut our budget by 2 trillion to get square? Of course not. We borrow from 2035. And what happens if we just say we're not going to pay ourselves back and that debt is gone? Nothing. It'll hurt the value of the dollar (or strengthen it depending on your economic view) because we say it does, but not any tangible reason. \n\nSo why that wall of text if we're talking NFTs? Because beanie babies, crypto, and dollars are all as valuable as we agree they are. Bitcoin could be 5 million per coin, it could cost 40 trillion dollars to buy a loaf of bread. And nothing is created, no service administered, no tangible asset used or destroyed to say a coin is worth 5 million or anything. \n\nMoney is imaginary so that we aren't trading cows for shoes anymore. It simplifies exchanges but with no gold standard all you can rely on is GDP and that's made up based on the value of the dollar it influences. Closed loop that we just make up as we go. \n\nSo if you think NFTs will get wide enough adoption to be valuable, knock yourself out. I personally think we're decades from that when alternate forms of dollars still haven't caught on. People think pretending there's a finite resource makes it valuable. But why not slap millions of unique codes on a given NFT? Then your Spongebob NFT is exactly like mine.  And if enough of that happens all you've done is redesign the dollar. Closed loop. \n\nI know you weren't looking for all that but it explains anything claiming to be a new way to buy or sell or invest. It will always come back to the same ideas. \n\nAnd that's my post-scarcity 101 lesson. Anyone interested in more should NOT try to argue with me about using up nickel or trees or whatever because that's skipping ahead a few steps and is still in the closed loop. There's places to discuss the finer details but this isn't it.",

There was no reoccurring income to be made by them. \n\nThere are other NFTs that are images, but in addition to whatever value is had by owning the image, the owner of the image can earn a percentage of the fees made by the sales of all of the NFTs in that collection. When an NFT is resold, a percentage goes to the original maker of the NFT. Some collections offer a percentage of the resale fees back to the NFT owners. Now that creates a passive income by owning it. How much? It depends on what is written in to the contract and the resale value. That in itself can give the NFT a higher value.\n\nThis is just the beginning, what else could you do with an NFT? You can create a document showing ownership of anything that is not changeable since it is permanent logged in a public blockchain. It will be possible to have property deeds, auto titles, medical records, anything you would have ownership records for. It will be cheaper, easier to validate authenticity, and tamper proof. \n\nImagine playing fortnight or another game like it. Playing long enough to gain weapons, skins, or any other upgrades. You, as the player, can now turn around and sell those items to others. The game would get a small cut of every sale, but the majority of ownership is in the players hands.\n\nThe future is about ownership. You making money off of your own data, not Facebook. Musicians, artists, making money off of their product, not apple/google/Spotify or whoever else sells their product and takes a huge cut. \n\nI'm glad there are so many naysayers and people who just have no idea what they are talking about, it tells me there is more time to collect more NFTs so I can sell them to everyone once they realize the value.",
            "Yes. But collectibles have lasted a hell of a long time on the same principle. Why is a Spiderman No. 1 valuable? Or a Gutenberg bible? As long as the underlying NFT is relevant, it will be valuable. But most of these NFTs will be worthless.",

If ten people are willing to pay a million for it and the transaction is ended, yes, that monkey can be worth one million, but only if found by someone interested. \n\nSo, there's that.\n\nNFT market yes, it's moving a lot, but a lot of it it's between the same closed group of ultrarich moving it on to appear that the market has any value and try to grasp some investors.",

            "Money is fungible, which means that it\u2019s interchangeable. If I swapped your $10 bill for another $10 bill, you wouldn\u2019t care because the money is indistinguishable. $10 is $10.\n\nHowever, non-fungible tokens(NFT) are cryptographically distinct. Any digital document, from a picture or text file to a program, can be converted into an NFT, which acts as an immutable, absolute receipt of ownership. No one can copy the receipt and use their copy to make a claim. It\u2019s non-fungible. Only you have it. You can trade it, though, if you want to exchange ownership.\n\nHowever, having a receipt of ownership on the blockchain is not legally binding. No government or company recognizes your claim. Buying an NFT is the equivalent of buying a star from a random company. You don\u2019t actually own the star and if NASA representatives decided to investigate it, you couldn\u2019t charge them with trespassing.\n\nNFTs might have a practical application. Some countries or major companies may adopt it as an alternative to their copyright system. Others may issue their home ownership contracts or wills as NFTs to ensure they cannot be modified by unscrupulous parties.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible to create decentralized brokerages for stocks or trading contracts. The blockchain that powers most NFTs is Euthereum and it can be programmed to act in certain ways. For instance, if a company issued its stocks as NFTs, hypothetically, it\u2019s possible that these contracts could automatically extract dividends from the issuing company\u2019s reserves.\n\nOwnership is  not useful without means of enforcement. NFTs have no application without wide acceptance from corporations and governments.\n\nNot to mention, compared to conventional means of electronic ownership, the block chain uses hundreds of thousands times more energy per transaction. It\u2019s not environmentally friendly at all"

They can see in more colours than humans can. And the way they \"lock on\" to prey is to point both of their independently-seeing eyes onto it.

There are, broadly speaking two types of law: statutes which are passed by the legislature and common law, or \"judge made\" law. Statutes are what you think of when you think of a law. Your representatives in government write these laws, go through the democratic process of passing them, then they go into effect. Common law, on the other hand, develops over time through application. A judge gets a case that nobody has ever had to contend with in their jurisdiction. The judge has to make a decision that seems to fit within existing law, and subsequent judges build on that. It's the law of precedent. \n\nLaw students don't actually learn \"laws,\" at least not really. It'd be impractical, as laws change all the time and there are tons of them. Lawyers are trained to understand concepts and principles in various branches of law. We don't read statutes, but we read court opinions where laws are applied and interpreted. We learn how different areas of the law work and build skills to handle actual statutory laws we come in contact with in practice. Take criminal law, for instance. We learn about the requisite mens rea elements for different crimes, distinctions between types of murder, types of affirmative defenses, among other things. We do this so that when we read a statute for a certain state criminal law, we have the building blocks to work with and understand it. \n\nWe're also taught that laws exist as a way to codify social norms.

Them there's the issue of various local and state laws that change from one jurisdiction to the next. Again, that would be impossible to teach them all.\n\nSo instead you learn basic categories of law. Don't take from others without permission, don't hurt other people, don't drive dangerously, things like that. Generally if you kniw those things then you aren't going to find yourself in much trouble.",
            "Ever heard the phrase \"ignorance of the law is no excuse\"?\n\nThat's why. You're not taught laws so that you will eventually and inevitably break laws, be told you have no excuse for it, and then be sent to jail as part of the for-profit prison network.\n\nThe one important thing to understand about the so-called \"justice\" system is that none of it actually exists for any kind of justice; it is all nothing more than profit generation for the government. The same government that jails you and educates, intentionally won't teach you about things it can jail you for. It's not a flaw in the system, it's a feature in a flawed system.",

If it educates, it does so secondarily.

If one understands that killing someone is wrong, you can understand that manslaughter and murder are different circumstances, and ruling bodies tend to regulate and define order into the minutiae.  \n\nTherefore law has a natural place in society, and is only defined because it needs to be, given the circumstances that take place in our lives.  When you want to understand a house, you don't spend your time researching the nails in the wall, you stand out in the street and look at the big picture.  If you want to understand an animal, you don't spend time with each individual hair follicle, you start at the head of the beast.\n\nAlthough law and order from any organization or even person can incorporate facts, it is ultimately based on assumptions of a communal perspective or social consciousness.",

What group of people also most heavily commits crimes? The poor do, as well. Now, let's follow the money. Who makes money off of a situation like this? The people who own prisons. And who has the money to lobby for harsher punishments to \"crack down on crime,\" and to lobby *against* improvements in education?

I tell them all the fucking time to STFU!! As I'm still trying to recover from my fucked up childhood. So leave us tf alone lol but.we live in the same town. I refuse to let them make me feel guilty or like a bad mother bc my son doesn't enjoy the beach like other children. Here's a big FUCK YOU TO BOTH MY PARENTS!! They are not the ones who have to handle the meltdowns and tears and fears and sensory issues and this or that. Ughhhhhhhhh. \n\nDo whatever the fuck makes you happy! This is for everyone who took the time to read this. Seriously! Fuck everyone's opinions and judgements. Live life for you and don't let people make you feel guilty or less than! **Especially your own freaking parents...\n\nSorry I got off topic. Obviously my parents piss me off and this is one of our biggest arguments. Mind your business, he's MY CHILD.",

Even working outside for 10 hours I still feel lile I should be outside when I'm home, if its bearable. Also I get a second wind just after dark.

            "Florida here. I'll be going outside in October, and not a minute sooner.",
            "I feel guilty too.  Only because of social conditioning, you must be outside in good weather.  Why?  all it has given me is so many moles and freckles.  I have had so many removed and have to get my skin checked every year.   The silly thing about it is that I am not an outdoorsy person.  I prefer to say inside in hot weather. Happier to go out in cold weather but not for long.",

            "I saw this post and immediately thought \u201cOh yeah that\u2019s me\u201d and started reading.. but then I was quite surprised by all of the answers echoing the same thing about the mind knowing it\u2019s not possible to go workout or start working on that art project or taking a class.  And I\u2019m like wtf?  I **do** all those things in the night, in fact it\u2019s the only time I do any of those things.\n\nI\u2019m very much a night owl, and I regularly workout late at night.  I do all of my best work of any kind late at night.  Anything I\u2019m trying to learn, I learn between the hours of 11pm and 6am.  \n\nI find peace when no one else is awake to bother me.  It\u2019s the only time I can really be alone with my thoughts, unbothered by a subconscious awareness in the back of my mind that I have to be ready to socialize or talk to someone at any given moment.\n\nSo while what is being said makes sense in theory and Im sure in reality for a lot of people, some of us get that same motivation and drive at night and **act on it**, and in some cases like mine, build our entire schedules around it!\n\nGranted, I\u2019m ADHD as fuck, so in my case it\u2019s likely an adaptive behavior optimizing for time that I can most easily access my hyper-focus zone uninterrupted.  But I encourage all of you try to actually acting on your late night motivational spurt as well!! You never know!  It may be because your mind is relaxed and allowing itself to fully be in the moment of what you\u2019re doing!",

            "Because deep down inside you know that there's no way you can accomplish those things in the middle of the night, so you tell yourself your going to do these things, but you've already given yourself a reason for why these things can't be done immediately (it's late at night). So you don't feel too bad about not doing these things right away and instead say you'll do them tomorrow.

It builds up over the course of the day. Adenosine- triphosphate (ATP) is the chemical that sends \"energy\" and building block material to the muscles. Creatine is a psuedo \"ATP- mimicking\" replacement chemical... anyways, i think Adenosine might have properties that act in the way you're describing.. perhaps in addition to making us sleepy, it stimulates the need to \"get shit done\"?

            "Copying an old comment of mine on a similar post:\n\nI've heard people say in the past that it's because when thinking about these things at night, you're making plans for \"future you\" that don't need to be acted upon immediately. It's convenient to say that you'll do X, Y, and Z in the morning because it doesn't require any immediate action, instead you can lay in bed and think about how productive you'll be at a later time.\n\nTry shifting your goal from \"tomorrow I will...\" to \"tonight I will...\" and see if that changes anything. That way, you remove the buffer of 8 (or 7, or 6.....or 5...) hours of sleep.",
            "Pick a time when you have a spare hour or two, and are not sleepy at all.\n\nGo get in bed, turn off the lights and shut the shades.\n\nMake sure anything entertaining or distracting is outside the room or at least off.  No phone, no book, no tv.\n\nJust lay there.\n\nWon't be long before your mind starts to wander and think about random crap. Pretty soon you'll be thinking about all the stuff you need to get done, or messed up, or daydreaming about things you want to do but maybe can't for whatever reason.\n\nIf that happens, then the night time stuff is just the inability to quiet your mind. Seems like most are either like us and can't just not think about stuff, or they can go relatively blank and think about unimportant stuff that doesn't cause any anxiety or the feel that you should be accomplishing something.\n\nPeople either live with this, or practice focussing thought, or learn how to truly meditate.\n\nI personally do one of two things...\n\nI focus on an object that's in a black space just floating there. Often an old school sword like from Camelot. Look at the details, truly see it. Nothing about the time it's from, only a visual.\n\nOther thing I do is tap my finger gently in rhythm the speed of my mind and count the taps. Then when it seems mundane and synced I slow the taps. Still counting. Keep slowing... Then I normally just wake up when an animal makes some noise...\n\nI've considered meditation, never tried, zero clue if I could do it. I had a very active mind. Great for getting complex crap done, crap for sleeping or relaxing...",
            "The top answer is not correct. This has to do with how the reward system works inside the brain. The brain knows you won't have the motivation, gives you the motivation then does not punish you for failure.... well not until later.",
            "For me personally I was unemployed for a time and I let my sleep schedule get away from me BUT, I still experienced this! The difference was that while I had peace and quiet at night, I could focus and lock on to all of the things I wanted to do because I knew that there was no other distraction that could possibly come up in the middle of the night and keep me from achieving my short term goals.\n\n\nI was able to make plans anywhere from a few hours to a few months away and 85% of the time I followed through on those goals. I still procrastinated on some things because maybe YouTube stole a few hours of my life, but even then I was learning things related to my field of interest which is the field in which I am now employed and I get to practice some of those skills I learned. So even then it wasn't wasted time, but it was time I had already alotted for something else.\n\n\nI say if you can actually spare the time and you're well within a sleep schedule that works for your regular life, chase those goals! Just don't forget to get some sleep.\n\n\nAs to WHY this happens... Like I said before, I think it must be the dark and quiet. Less light bouncing off of things that could be distracting. Most noises are silent or are simply \"white noise\" which I feel allows you to focus better. Then usually at night many people have a tendency to let their brains run away with random thoughts, but the setting is just right to allow you to focus. So maybe, you latch on to a random thought. Maybe since there's nothing else interesting going on, you focus on it and begin to work that thought out in your head.\n\n\nAn example of one of my random thought processes late at night... \n\n\n\"Yeah I could build that shelf... I got my measuring tape right here. I know what I want to put on that shelf so it need to be 36 inches long, 8 inches wide, probably an inch to 2 inch thick shelf. I just gotta order the brackets on amazon... Already got the screws in that tub. There's my stud finder. Pencil to mark the walls. I know I want the lower shelf to be about 48 inches from the ground. The two shelves have to be separated by 16 inches to fit everything I want up there. They're going to be on this wall across from that window and....\"\n\n\nNext thing I know I've bought the brackets, measured everything, pre-marked all the places to cut the wood and screw in everything, and then I move onto the next thing because I had to wait for the brackets and can't do anything else at the moment.\n\n\n\nSo with all that being said maybe there is something to the sense of knowing you can't complete a project so you are more motivated to do it. If that's the case though, allow that energy to be put to good use and allow yourself (if time and sleep allows) to get all the prep work done for various projects/tasks and then whenever you are able to finally finish those projects there's next to nothing left to do because you've already done all the prep work!",

The thoughts that are popping up are what you would be spending time on during the day within a different structure, perhaps even if you were left to your own devices. \n\nI'm not saying reject all external structure and authority, but this is a signal that you need to take charge of your routine. Since you're an athlete I would be willing to bet you've lost the structure that made you train day after day. Perhaps a transition into a different sport or a different coach, or starting college and no longer being involved in highly competitive team sports. It sounds like the latter to me. Like you no longer have a coach deciding when and how you train. It was someone else's job to think about it, now you're noticing that you're getting out of shape. You need to let someone be in charge and provide structure, it can either be yourself or someone else.",

Otherwise best answer I was seeing was it maybe related to ATP but given my very limited biology knowledge I doubt that's the case.

That way, our mind has an easier time evaluating whether or not we truly did the things we needed for that day. If it turns out the answer is no, then it's still easier to evaluate if it was worth it. I say this but I actually haven't done this lol.",

            "This happens to me way too much, and my theory is that I spend all this time building up productive and successful momentum throughout the day that I end myself on such a high note, expecting myself to get carry the momentum to the next day after some sleep. Problem is, sleep is a double edged sword, it probably does some rearranging of neurochemicals that nullifies all that motivation I had before and resets my brain. Useful if I\u2019m falling asleep depressed, not for when I fall asleep motivated.",

            "For me personally, it happens due to a delayed sleep phase disorder. My body has a longer circadian rhythm than the average person and thus my brain is more productive in the evening than in the daytime. I tend to do my best planning and creative thinking between 10p-2a, and often I will work out in the late hours instead of the daytime. \n\nFor anyone interested: [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_sleep_phase_disorder)\n\nIt could be a lot of things that have already been mentioned in this thread, but for me it\u2019s almost always simply because my brain is wanting to be awake and gogogo at times when the regular world is trying to sleep.",

            "So I see a lot of comments about not being able to actually do the things at night, so in turn you\u2019re more motivated. I can understand this and probably feel this way sometimes.\n\nHowever, I\u2019ve been a night owl since I was a wee lad and I\u2019ve always found myself more productive at night. For me, it\u2019s due to the fact that there is no pressure to be productive at that time. Working out is also great late at night because you\u2019re not surrounded by anybody.",
            "It's Net-time\n\nWe do things at night because the pressure has been nearly 100% alleviated. Day-time is associated with productivity. Getting anything done past 10pm is considered bonus. \n\nLazy isnt a real thing. We don't do things out of fear/avoidance of pain/not doing it well/not measuring up. \n\nWhen it's late at night you've just placed the \"container\" around the thing and have said to it: this time isn't real, so anything I get done is a win. And paradoxically you do the thing.\n\nOur minds defeat us all the time; creating containers to reduce the stakes of something will increase productivity. \n\nNight time is just the concept of net-time...its all bonus which makes it actually safe to get things done in this time frame.\n\nI am most depressed in the morning when the pressure of the day is highest.",
            "I\u2019m taking a course right now on learning how to learn. Our brain in a focused state heavily relies on neural pathways we already have established well. This means that it works well in cases we already know how to do things, but in cases where we need to have new perspective or creativity it actually could hinder our thought processes.\n\nIn comes the second state, called diffused. If you were to think of it as pinball, focused would be much closer bumpers while diffused is much more spaced for free movement. You achieve diffused when you kind of just let your mind wander, or exercise, or do something you could kind of veg out on. \n\nEver have something come to you Or click when you aren\u2019t trying? That\u2019s due to this. I believe that maybe what you are experiencing like many others allows for situations of non focused states where you create ideas that are clear to what you need to do with yourself. The issue is that you don\u2019t have these thoughts cemented into long term memory, so if you have good ideas, start writing them down in the moment so you can work on making them a reality.",

I dont have to worry about cooking meals or picking kids up from school. No one talks to me or asks me to do things. I can focus on cleaning or fixing my life without any interruption. Also, I'm a night owl. I find it very hard to have motivation during the day when I'm sleepy and busy, but nighttime is my time to shine. I feel awake and energized. To be fair though, I also work a lot of night shifts so I'm used to being productive at night.",

Sometimes I stay up attempting to create a new organization method for work only to never look at it again, or I\u2019ll find some interesting topic and cram as much info about it as possible into my head only to forget 90% of it by morning until some random piece of it pops up during some random, unrelated convo.

            "In my opinion, this is our brain fooling us by giving us a hit of 'instant-gratification'. When we're about to go to bed ou just about done with our day, we start planning for the coming days and make x number of plans on how to improve ourselves. As different as these plans may be, there's one thing common to all of them - they can only be done come morning. Take, for example, I decide I'm going to wake up early, study for 4 hours straight and clean the house until it's spotless. Now I personally feel good because I've made so many plans and now I can go to bed in peace, which is what our brain wants. For us to be able to sleep peacefully *right now.*\n\nHowever, come morning, the transient goal of being happy until we fall asleep is finished and so the brain goes into its normal routine of everyday life. \n\nAll the motivation we had, was just so we could be at peace for a couple of minutes and fall asleep sooner. It served it's purpose so it went away.\n\nTo tackle this, whenever I'm hit with a surge of motivation late at night and I wanna make plans, I ensure to include *at least one thing* that can be done *right now.* Example, if I make plans to wake up early and study, I set my table just how I wanna see it in the morning with the correct books and pens on the table, a bottle of water at the side and I set an alarm for 10 minutes before I wanna wake up. Doing so can help to shift the urgency of the task as now instead of the tasks beginning in the morning after I wake up, they've already begun the night before and I'm simply gonna continue it in the morning.\n\nIt's all in the perspective.",

            "I do a lot of stuff late at night and into the early hours of the morning. I don't like being watched when I do certain things, like clean, organize or workout. It gives me more privacy that way. (Some people are ridiculously anal about anything you do not being done properly, so have anxiety with such things.)\n\nEven if you can't do specific things until \"regular hours,\" you can at least plan everything out as far as if you need to call a number, have paperwork, etc. Junk like that. Makes it much easier for me personally when I have to deal with people again. I feel more at ease because my past self prepared me.\n\nIt could also simply be feeling more relaxed and content for you, so you feel positive about tackling everything.",

            "This is a good point.\n\nPeople with extreme viewpoints love to use racial \u201cprivilege\u201d as an excuse to preclude whites which is a form racism. Think about things like: black(native, hispanic) history dates and events, channels and campus \u201csafe spaces\u201d; all of which are prime examples of extremism. Don\u2019t agree; too bad because it\u2019s about how (you) make (me) feel, that\u2019s the \u201cstandard\u201d right? That type of mentality is really getting out of hand and should be stopped. \n\nCan you imagine the backlash at: the white pride tv channel, white broadcast network or areas guaranteed free of people of color on a campus? How\u2019d that work again? \n\nTrue equality is accomplished by hiring the best candidates, admitting the best students and using talent no matter what creed etc. There should be zero preferences given because that is racism, just a flavor maybe not widely acknowledged yet. \n\nWas there a great movie with the majority non-white actors? Great, let\u2019s all enjoy it. Did they suppress white actors that perhaps were more talented to get \u201cdiversity\u201d? Then that\u2019s a whole different thing. Sometimes you have to hire a certain ethnic background because it\u2019s hard for a Mexican to play a black fella and vv. However, when you preclude greater intelligence, harder work, or better qualifications, to accomplish some extremist driven agenda then that\u2019s wrong.\n\n\n\n",

            "Diversity is encouraged because groups typically go underrepresented.  When I think about it, it is descriptive when you're talking about a 50/50 cast in a movie where racial homogeneity just makes no sense.\n\nDiversity is a dumb term, I think, when talking about Black Panther.  One reason the movie is exceptional is because it is a successful pop culture movie that is extensively casted with black people (I don't say African-American because they're not all American, like Lupita Nyong'o).  That's not diverse by definition, but it is a good thing.  I think because diversity is desirable, people just accidentally use it as a synonym for \"good\", even though, as your question illustrates, the words don't mean the same thing.",

            "The most important thing to understand is the broader context. Black Panther is an mainstream blockbuster movie. Most blockbuster movies are made by white people, and cast mostly white people, so having more black people than white people increases the diversity of the medium of film as a whole. Look at the MCU, Iron man, Thor, Captain America, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Bruce Banner, Ant Man, Spider Man, Doctor Strange, Quicksilver, and Scarlet Witch are all white, and their supporting casts are mostly white. Having most of the cast of Black Panther be black doesn't come near overwhelming that.\n\nThe second thing to understand is that Africa is not a nation, it is an enormous continent with a diversity of cultures. Black Europeans, black Americans, and black Africans come from very different cultures, in addition to the diversity of culture within those continents.",

That would be like us saying X movie isn't diverse because the cast is mostly from North America.\n\nIf you're just talking about the color of people's skin as a factor of diversity then in comparison to nearly all Hollywood films the movie has a very diverse take. Consider that almost every lead role and nearly every Blockbuster released in Hollywood goes to light skinned male and female actors not to mention supporting roles and extras. \n\nIt's normal for people to see a movie based in places heavily populated with minorities to be cast with almost all white male/female extras.\n\nGranted there are some exceptions, the general consensus among people of color is that they are seldom represented in Hollywood, and when they are it's often in a negative viewpoint.",

            "Depends on how you look at it.\n\nBlack Panther, having a mostly African or African-American cast, is not diverse at all. However, if you go into specifics, many of the cast members and/or their ancestors come from different regions of Africa (for example, Zimbabwe and Uganda), so it is very diverse. However, by that logic, a film with mostly white people could also be very diverse, since some may be English, Irish, Italian, French, etc.\n\nThe other way to look at it is not to look at the diversity within the movie itself, but in the Hollywood industry as a whole. In that case, since the cast is mostly consisted of \u201cminorities\u201d, it can be considered diverse. Again though, that means a movie such as The Godfather, with a largely Italian/Italian-American cast, could also be considered a diverse movie, since Italians technically are also \u201cminorities\u201d, although not usually considered minorities (although historically they have been).\n\n**TL;DR**: It\u2019s not really diverse within the movie itself, but it can be if you look at specifics. Within the Hollywood industry, it is diverse, but so are a lot of other movies that might not normally be considered diverse.",

            " \n\nIt is a reference to the very popular Christmas film, *Home Alone 2: Lost In New York*, which was released in 1992 and stars Macaulay Culkin as a young child who accidentally boards the wrong plane to New York City instead of Miami for his family's Christmas vacation. It is the sequel to the even more popular Christmas film, *Home Alone*, in which the same child is accidentally left at home when his family leaves for Paris over Christmas.\n\nThe line, \"Merry Christmas, ya filthy animal,\" comes from a parody film inside the *Home Alone* franchise. In the first film, the child, named Kevin, finds and watches an old black-and-white gangster film entitled *Angels with Filthy Souls*, a film that his mother would not let him watch because of its use of gun violence and language.\n\n*Angels* is not a real movie, but rather a film created for this film. The scene that is shown in *Home Alone* depicts a man that owes money to another man who appears to be the head of some sort of gang or mafia. The head man tells the other man the owes the money the he has to the count of ten before he shoots him. Well, he winds up shooting the man, and at the end, he says \"Keep the change, ya filthy animal.\" In *Home Alone 2*, Kevin finds the sequel to *Angels*, cleverly titled *Angels with Filthier Souls*, in which a similar scene is depicted with the same head man. This time, he shoots a woman, and at the end of the scene, he says \"Merry Christmas, ya filthy animal.\"",
