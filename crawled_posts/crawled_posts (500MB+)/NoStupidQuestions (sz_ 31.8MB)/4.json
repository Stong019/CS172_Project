Only a single person can be elected and that person is whoever gets the most votes, so it makes sense for ideologically aligned people to pool their resources and present a single person instead of all trying to win and losing to a different unified party.   \nThis is why endorsements from the same party exist and why third party candidates can never win more than a few percentage points.",

With almost four full years to scrutinize candidates and dig for dirt on people, everyone ends up looking like a lying criminal either because they are or fabricated \"evidence\" has time to be produced.

It makes punishing your own politicians a non-option and leaves plenty of time for the grifter class to get on with the grifting. In the midsts of that a bunch of exceptionally corrupt assholes has settled within the upper echelons of the republican party and turned it into the dumpster fire it is today. Anyone who criticises them is labeled a dissenter or secret democrat or whatever. They're genuinely terrible by any standard, and lots of their own voters really hate them. But who are they going to vote for? Democrats? This sub has plenty of examples of democrats who practically trip over themselves to hurl insults at anyone who's not already a 'real' democrat. Any criticism of the party gets one labeled a dissenter or secret Russian or whatever. Of course, voting third party is treated like voting for the enemy too.\n\n>The net result is a bunch of entrenched voters who'll vote for \"their side\" no matter what, and a bunch of non-voters who are simply disgusted with the whole process and hope some hero will appear one day to clean up the mess.\n\n>The real threat to that entire system is education and journalism, which have been systematically decimated in the US.",
            "I'll go against the grain and suggest that it's because of:\n\n1. a concerted effort by certain people to depress enthusiasm and engagement, as this will favour their interests;\n\n2. an instinctive desire to \"see both sides\" of an issue, even when it isn't appropriate to do so;\n\n3. the media's need to maintain a horse-race narrative, as well as individual journalists succumbing to point 2; and\n\n4. the intellectually lazy culture of hating all politicians (\"they're all just as bad as each other\"), which is used to shield people from having to challenge their own beliefs.\n\nThis isn't to say there aren't elections where you have to choose the lesser of two evils, but I think it isn't as common as some people would like to pretend.",

It's seen in every single place it's instituted that it eventually devolves into an entrenched, fairly diametrically opposed two-party system. When you have an entrenched two-party system you get something called the spoiler effect. There's a lot of other problems with this voting method. It drives down voter turnout, it radicalizes both sides. You can actually see it polarizing 50% of the population against the other 50% anywhere it's implemented.\n\nBut the bottom line to answer your question is that we end up with vanilla candidates who's qualifications are, \"They aren't as bad as the other option\".",

            "Not sure if it has been discussed much yet, but in my opinion, the primary process has a lot to do with this as well. In the primaries, the really invested, hardcore Democrats and really invested, hardcore Republicans are choosing a candidate. This leads to radical candidates; more radical than the general voting public. \n\nHowever, this also leads to people making weird judgement calls, like what happened this time in the Democratic election. Choosing the person who is \"electable over people who may be better humans and leaders. Or looking toward who they will be up against and who is better primed to beat that person, instead of just choosing someone on their own merit. This leads to some compromises in who is the \"best\" candidate. \n\nAND, these organizations that run the primaries are not without their own agendas. The DNC and RNC are private organizations, with leaders who want to remain in power; with leaders who have their own back-door deals, friendships, investments, and personal agendas. This can also lead to the true \"best\" candidates being screened out in favor of someone who can benefit a small few already in positions of power.",

Now we got Biden Vs Trump and yet again Im left sitting here thinking to myself...this is what our country came up with?another damn shit show.  We got Biden, a man borderline forgetting why he's even speaking but seems to have no problem smelling and creeping up on his underage relatives. A damn near full blown alzheimers patient. Oh and in the other corner you have Trump  a one percenter, land developer, reality TV show host who has been known to for a fact grope women and pay for sex. Known friend of Mr. Epstein whos the most famous sex trafficking pedophile in American history. I promise that no matter who you vote for it will do no good at all. Yeah,  yeah, we should exercise our freedom and vote, make a change....yeah, make a change alright.  If Mrs. Clinton is Bidens  vice prez I think within his 1st year she'll have had him assassinated and she'll be sworn in immediately.  Them slowly over the next year or so after Mrs Clinton has put a few laws and policies into the works members of congress, white house employees, secret service men and random citizens who oppose her will start to mysteriously start dying from conditions they never had, car accidents, and \"invisible \" snipers. Then the only man willing to put up with her madness, old Bill Clinton will step forth into her chamber deep within a white house bunker. There they will fight to the death. Meanwhile our new all powerful alien overlords will solve 99% of our problems in a day.

He brings life experiences that I think will be valuable. While he's not as progressive as I would like, I think his political compass is about where America's political compass is. That's a good thing, at least for now. I also think he recognizes that he needs to have wins for the progressive wing of the party if he wants to have another term or a Democrat succeed him.",

It takes many years of building up your following, getting lobbying power behind you, making friends in the right places who can give you endorsements.\n\nAll of that means that by the time you're in a position where you could potentially run for president, you had to do at least some degree of selling out, backing a corporation etc etc.\n\nIt's not exactly a secret that there is a lot of cutthroat, disingenuous practice to becoming the leader of a 300 million person country.\n\nOn top of that the media and political commercials are generally going to be hyper focused on making one candidate look bad.\n\nnews stations are going to present every story they can to make someone look bad, liberal outlets and vice versa. Goes both ways.\n\nto the point of completely dishonest and intentionally misleading reporting\n\nFox, cnn, etc will present quotes from Obama, trump clinton etc etc however they can to push a narrative. Sometimes it may be valid, and sometimes it may be an unfair Distortion of what was actually said.\n\nBut this means that when people watch the news, whether they are watching conservative Outlets or a liberal Outlets or relatively independent Outlets, they are seeing a message pushed of equating a given person with negativity at every turn.\n\nSo it quickly becomes a lesser of two evils situation.\n\nWe also live in a day and age where it is much much easier to see these stories.

            "I also believe a big part of the issue is the popularity of \u201csmear campaigns\u201d, wherein it is more important to demonize your opponent rather than talk about what a candidate actually brings to the table. As a result, the majority of ads seen by the voting public make it seem like any candidate they choose is a villain. You\u2019re then left to either believe the ads, and feel dirty about your vote, or ignore the ads and thus begin to distrust the media. It\u2019s very lose-lose, and the resulting desensitization of the voting public opens the door for actual villains to gain office.",

The DNC and the RNC pick the candidate that gives their party **the best chance to stay in power**. Bernie Sanders is leaps and bounds more popular than Joe Biden, and was even more so than Hillary Clinton, and in both elections the DNC made a concerted effort to hitch their wagon to the candidate that best aligns *their* - not the American people's - interests, which often includes corporate interests. \n\nVoting 3rd party is essentially wasting your vote - no 3rd party candidate has gotten over 20% of the popular vote since Teddy Roosevelt in 1912... and Teddy was already a fairly popular President from 1901-1909. Most 3rd party candidates since Ross Perot (19% in '92) can't even squeeze out 5% of the popular vote. Hell, Bernie Sanders isn't even a Democrat, and still ran on the Democratic ticket because only the 2 party powerhouses have the money and the influence to make a viable run at the White House.\n\nSo based on the de-facto 2 party system we have, we are often left with 2 candidates that each only appeal to about half the electorate, and even that appeal may be more a function of being \"less crappy\" than the other candidate",

I\u2019d put money on trump again or his family or the worst version of the GOP. 70/30) Trump wins in 2020.... bye bye America as #1. China WILL be #1; they\u2019re already making moves.\n\nSo thanks South Park. You told a couple generations of kids that voting sucks and all parties were equally guilty: enjoy your $500million fortune while we all forget the guys telling us all the candidates and parties are the same and to not vote BUT ARE MEMBERS OF THE 0.1% club.\n\nAHAHAHAHAHAHA hahahahaha.",
            "Obama vs McCain seemed like a choice between two really good people with different agendas. Same as with Obama vs Romney. You may just dislike the candidates, I don't know. Trump's base thinks he is better than Jesus, so they easily will feel like they are choosing the better candidate. Likewise, anti-Trump people will have zero problems fantasizing about a nice calm Biden presidency and easily think he is 1000 times a better candidate. But really it just comes down to what you consider a good candidate to be. I thought Obama and Romney were both good people, but they were both portrayed as the antichrist/worse than Hitler by opposing sides.",
            "Im Mexican and that happens here too. Too sad cause we dont actually have the power to choose for a good president but for the less stupid.",
            "Because that's exactly what it is. Always has been. Forever will be, sadly.",
            "You must be too young to remember 08.",
            "Because the two American parties both have a core elite that basically wants to run the show forever and they will sideline anyone who is even 10% of an outsider because anyone who isn't fully part of their mafia (yeah I said it) is a threat. Many of the people they put forward are thus elitist, greedy, sanctimonious, hypocritical and outright corrupt. Now semi-outsiders can get in if they have no decency and are willing to play even dirtier than their opponents, which is kind of what Trump did, he was such an asshole that he was invincible because all of his opponents appeals to some hypocritical and hollow notions of decency had absolutely no effect on him, and I say this as a person who dislikes him. \n\nSo there you have it. The majority establishments play it safe and push out corrupt, out-of-touch or even evil figureheads who keep the lid on things while the only outsiders who can penetrate are horrible because you have to be a real one-of-a-kind asshole to cut through this kind of web. That's why it's lesser of two evils almost always.",
            "It doesn't always feel like this. After Bush started invading other countries it was a no-brainer to vote for anyone but him, and when Obama came up on the ticket I was overjoyed to finally have an actual leader to vote for. Most of the other races have been the lesser of two evils, though, and I've been voting since the 80's. (I know people who saw Reagan the way I see Obama, too.)\n\nThe only other general-election candidate I actively wanted to be in office was Perot, but it was always clear (even at the time) that he couldn't win, so that wasn't a real choice.",

Sometimes I feel kinda bad about pinning her so quickly but that's because I forget how much of a gap there really is between our strength. \n\nA larger frame and a lifetime of testosterone makes a massive difference in overall strength even if you don't work out.\n\nI'm seeing a lot of comments in this thread of woman saying they took self defense classes and its great that they're taking that initiative. However it's valuable to keep in mind that confidence and a couple basic martial arts moves won't help you when there's such a gap in raw strength. Regardless of gender, best thing to do in violent situations is to run. Can't get grabbed, punched, kicked or stabbed if you've already run 50 feet away.",

            "A study done on the grip strength of 1,654 healthy men and 533 healthy women aged 20-25 years found that even professional women athletes in sports like Judo and Handball were significantly less capable than their unprofessional male counterparts. Although grip strength isn't telling of overall strength, it is still quite telling.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>90% of females produced less force than 95% of males.

            "Yes. [This](https://www.castironstrength.com/elite-strength-sports-ipf-and-iwf-a-comparision-of-sex-and-performance/) is a good article on the topic of pure weightlifting sports. To put it in perspective [this article](https://law.duke.edu/sports/sex-sport/comparative-athletic-performance/)  by Duke Law says \"Just in the single year 2017, Olympic, World, and U.S. Champion Tori Bowie's 100 meters lifetime best of 10.78 was beaten 15,000 times by men and boys.  (Yes, that\u2019s the right number of zeros.) The same is true of Olympic, World, and U.S.  Champion Allyson Felix\u2019s 400 meters lifetime best of 49.26.  Just in the single year 2017, men and boys around the world outperformed her more than 15,000 times.\"\n\nYup, you read that right \"boys\" males under the age of 18. The best mature women in the world with a decade more training can't even touch an elite male high schooler's numbers. A woman has never broken the top 500 in the world in any of the athletic sports listed regardless of sex and they rarely break the top 1000.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the award strangers!

I said ok, would you like to arm wrestle or something to see? She then was really shocked at how easily I prevented her from even moving my arm, let alone having any hope of winning, and then asked her when she had had enough proof, showed her that when I wanted to, her arm was going down.\n\nShe didn't understand that while exercise and athletics can have a massive impact on physical abilities, there is also simply a massive innate biological difference between the sexes when it comes to natural physical strength.  If you see a male that isn't an athlete, don't automatically assume he's weak.  You'd be surprised.",

            "Man how do so many of yall not know this, yes and the difference is big. That's why women are generally very cautious and even afraid of men. They can easily overpower you one on one, so the only thing you can do is stay vigilant or get a weapon. It's why women smile or \"play nice\" to guys who are awful (for example harassing them). If they get mad and decide to get physical, how tf are you supposed to handle them? Shit is laughably unfair. Men who make fun of women for being \"\"paranoid\"\" about their safety will never know what it's like to have half the population posses the ability to easily restrain you with their bare hands. Note that I said \"posses the ability to do so\" (since just this thought/possibility is unnerving by itself). Ib4 the barage of \"not all men blah blah\" . Men would behave in the manner most women do if placed in our shoes.",
            "Women CAN be strong\nMen CAN be weak.\n\nWith that out of the way, the average healthy male is MUCH larger, faster and stronger than the average healthy female. It's not a bad thing, or a good thing. It's just a thing",
            "Grip strength is a good indicator of overall strength.\n\nFor an average man, it's about 73 lbs, and for a woman it's about 44 lbs.\n\nSo, most men have about double the strength of most women.",
            "Yes, men are naturally stronger than women, a lot stronger",
            "I remember reading a statistic somewhere that essentially suggested that 90% of men are stronger than *all* women, and that the strongest 10% of women are only about as strong as the weakest 10% of men.",
            "Honestly, this is why they say you shouldn\u2019t hit women. Not because you aren\u2019t entitled to defend yourself, not because of some outdated gender notions, but because men can just do so much more damage to a woman physically than a woman could do to a man.\n\nHere\u2019s my example: a road rage incident turned into a physical confrontation. I\u2019m not sure if she was drunk or just irrationally angry but she threw a beer bottle at me (that was in her vehicle???) and I pulled my phone out to record. She slapped the phone out of my hand and I saw red. I put a hand on each of her shoulders and *pushed*. Not really even that hard I thought. Probably the force you would use launching a basketball while trying to make a three-pointer. She *flew* and fell flat on her ass. And that was the end of the fight. Whereas before she had been full of piss and vinegar, shouting and hollering, all the fight went out of her completely. She walked, head down and silent, right back to her vehicle and drove away.\n\nThat was the moment I realized men are *so* much stronger than women. Obviously I\u2019m not saying I have anything on a deadlifter. But any average man is going to be leagues above the strength of any average woman. It\u2019s not sexism, it\u2019s testosterone. It\u2019s crazy what an effect is has on muscle development.",

In some species females are the bad bitches and males are cute little puppies",
            "I think the usual answer is you can always find some woman stronger than some man, but on the whole/average, men are stronger. Pretty obvious when you look at competitive sports. It\u2019s biology.",
            "My wife works out and has 20 lbs on me.  When we goof around I am always surprised at how litte strength I have to use against her.  I think a lot of women do not understand the huge strength and athleticism difference between men and women.",
            "Whenever I hear this question I like to think of what it would be like if men lived in a world were the opposite sex were 7 ft tall 400 lbs ogres who cat called and harassed them on the streets.",
            "Yes, I am a short man 5.6\u20195/5\u20197 and whilst I\u2019m pretty muscular (200lb) I\u2019m conscious that most people will view me as weak because of my height. I\u2019m fairly non-confrontational due to this, but have been in many fights with men growing up.\n\nWeirdly, i have been the victim of one attempted mugging and the assailant was a 6\u20192 burly women lol, she stepped out of the alley I was walking through and swung for me and connected. I\u2019ve been punched by men of similar statue before and it would at least rock me, if they had any weight behind them it would hurt like a motherfucker  and in this situation where I was unprepared, potentially just KO me. But I honestly barely felt it, to the point where I just laughed in surprise. The women stopped and stared at me and I looked at her and it was honestly the weirdest interaction of my life. I don\u2019t know if it was the first time she had ever tried to mug someone and saw a short guy and thought it would be easy pickings or something but neither of us said a word after looking at each other for what felt like ages after the failed attempt at knocking me out. She just ran off and I walked away. It was bizzare, but I realised that even a ridiculously big women is much weaker than me.",
            "In context. The Serena sisters thought they could take on top ranked men. So the 198th player at the time challenged them on tht bet. He showed up drunk and pissed about. Destroyed them with ease due to sheer power difference. Serena was a beast bigger and more athletic than most men. But that didn't make a difference as men just has more muscle mass due to sexual dimorphism.",
            "When I was at the military I was serving alongside women. In the physical tests, which involved running and push ups, not only there was an insane gap in the demand (5 pushups for girls vs 30 for guys etc.) I, who have never trained a day on my life have easily outperformed girls who were professional athletes and ran in competitions after just three months of training (same training, btw). So yes, the gap is so big it's unbelievable",
            "So I don't want to make out like I was roy Jones Jr or anything, but before I transitioned I worked in a steel warehouse moving 500 pound bars 10 hours a day and I could handle myself. Well.\n\nAbout a year into estrogen and testosterone blockers (along with an office job), thinking that nothing had changed *that* much, I got into a fight at a bar. I was a little bit bigger than his guy and he didn't even know how to throw a punch, he just kind of swung his knuckles at me like he thought arms were a baseball bat or something\n\nAnd he *kicked the shit* out of me. There was literally nothing I could do. I was holed up in bed for 3 days afterward.\n\nI know people insist on believing that trans women have man strength, but I'm telling you firsthand that all of my muscles just melted away. I have the same strength level as any other woman with my size, build, and exercise habits\n\nAnd the difference between those two strength levels is terrifying",
            "Long time athlete and power lifter. The answer is yes. I know a female at my last gym. She was noticeably jacked. Hard core power lifter. Watched her hit a PR of 315. Knowing 315 isn\u2019t exactly easy for females I congratulated her thoroughly. The first time I ever deadlifted I deadlifted 315 for multiple reps.\n\nThere are some strong fucking females out there though. Females who can out lift my PR (580 lb deadlift for me). But they\u2019re extremely rare.\n\nSo again, yes. The short answer is men are indeed on average remarkably stronger than women.",
            "As a transgender woman\u2026 YES. Testosterone is a helluva drug. I\u2019m not a particularly strong person but I could 100% feel the difference in since I started taking hormones a decade ago. \n\nEven the smallest of guys could easily beat me up. Men have significantly more strength; I\u2019ve been in situations where this has been eerily apparent. \n\nThis is why \u201cdoping\u201d and steroids are such a big deal in sports.

            "I think it is because they were believed to have a dominant military, and they are struggling compared to what the world's expectations were.",
            "There's an element of the fact that the west is generally on Ukraine's side, and that we're therefore seeing a Ukraine-centric perspective\n\nBut at the same time, the maps don't lie: Russia was expected to roll Ukraine over in a matter of days or weeks, yet is now 7 weeks into the war and have clearly not steamrolled Ukraine or even achieved their likely/apparent goals\n\nThere's no way around the fact that Russia clearly (despite their new \"You didn't dump me, I dumped you, I didn't even want to date you in the first place\" narrative) wanted to take Kyiv and enforce regime change. And not only did they not achieve that in the first few days as they clearly expected, and not only have they not achieved it at all... but they've even retreated away from the area and given up on the objective entirely. There's no way to realistically paint that as anything other than an abjact failure\n\nEven if this had been a near-peer conflict (a war between two sides expected to be of roughly equal strength) then the attacker would expected to achieve some major objectives, otherwise why are they attacking at all? But Russia was one of the most feared militaries on the planet and Ukraine barely even a blip on the regional map, and Ukraine fought them to a standstill well short of Russia's objectives.\n\nThat's not to say Russia can't get anything out of this war or will have entirely failed - but thus far they've tanked their economy and killed 5-10k of their own men, shattered their military reputation on the world stage, united NATO and the EU, started Germany on a re-militarization path, pushed Finland and Sweden into NATO's hands, and is still nowhere near to even achieving their \"fallback\" goals of taking the entirety of Donbas.\n\nIt's possible that Russia could have a successful offensive in the east and take the rest of Donbas and secure Mariupol (which looks inevitable), on top of the canal supplying Crimea's water which has already been captured. You could consider that Russia has, at that point, achieved enough objectives to be worth the invasion - but the cost for that has been huge and it's hard to argue that it's been worthwhile\n\nThe only thing Russia has *really* achieved is to secure the Crimean water supply, and to ensure Ukraine doesn't join NATO... but that was already off the table since 2014, all Russia had to do was continue quietly supporting the existing war in Donbas and Ukraine was going to stay out of NATO anyway",
            "While I have no way to know for sure I\u2019d imagine the truth is somewhere in between. Both sides are trying to exaggerate the others losses. \n\nWhat is kind of indisputable is that the invasion has not gone well for the Russians.   They made a very obvious drive to capture Kiev immediately and failed to do so.    Given the size and armament disparity between the two countries, that\u2019s a pretty stunning defeat. It\u2019s far from over though as Russia still has all of the advantages, even if momentum is not on their side currently.",
            "Good question.  Here's my understanding so far:\n\nRussia has a logistics issue.  They have a lot of tanks and mechanized vehicles but they can't get the supplies to them.  Reason is they rely heavily on their rail network which the closest one, in the beginning of the war, was in Belarus at the border of Ukraine.  A few weeks ago, the Ukrainians and some Belarus defectors blew up the rail line at the Russian border which caused the Russian supply lines to fall back even further.\n\nRussia was prepared for a 7ish day war.  Steam roll in there, knock out the capital and retake the country.  That didn't happen due to fierce resistance and now they're facing that supply chain issue which continually gets worse the longer this goes on.\n\nThe whole thing is very interesting in that Russia believes NATO to be an aggressor and an enemy.  Russia wants a buffer zone between themselves and NATO.  Geographically, the border of Ukraine and Russia is sparse farmland with no natural barriers.  If Russia were to push it's borders further west, then they have geographic barriers like mountains.  Strategically, this makes sense to give them a buffer against, what they perceive, is a NATO invasion.\n\nCrimea was taken in 2014.  Crimea has a lot of oil reserves off the coast.  This was also a foothold into Ukraine.  The one thing that Crimea doesn't have is a lot of fresh water.  They have one river that runs thru Ukraine and thru the area which Ukraine dammed off in their territory.  This caused Russia to have to import water for 2.1M people during a time where record breaking heatwaves were occurring.  Logistically, this was a nightmare for Russia as they had to build infrastructure (Bridges) and use trucks to get fresh water into Crimea and continue their oil exploitation.\n\nThere are vast oil reserves off the coast of Ukraine and Crimea.  If Russia can just capture the coastal areas and unblock the dam then they can land-lock Ukraine and cause economic and supply chain issues into Ukraine.  This would force the Ukraine to the bargaining table and possibly force them under the Russian umbrella.\n\nIf you look closely at the [battle map](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60506682) and whats going on, you can see where Russia has pushed themselves along the coast lines to make the above possible.  I don't know specifically where the Dam in the Ukraine is located, but at one point during the beginning Russia had done a spearhead attack directly up that river.\n\nSo, it's a \"Win\" for Russia if they can unblock that dam and if they can capture the coast.  It's a bigger \"Win\" for Russia if they take the entire country.  The longer this drags on though, the worse it's going to get.\n\nThe West has evolved in Warfare (Debatable, but hear me out).  We don't carpet bomb cities anymore.  We don't indiscriminately gas civilian population centers.  Russia doesn't care about this and will carpet bomb as they see fit.  The longer this goes on the more of a chance to see Gas attacks on civilians and who knows what's next after that.\n\nBack on point, to answer your question:  Yes, propaganda on both sides.  However, the battle map is really what to keep an eye on with those points above in mind.  The atrocities are horrible and I hope this will end soon.  If Putin can get those above goals, he will most likely call it quits even if he doesn't take the country itself.",
            "Everyone expected Russia to conquer Ukraine in like a week. Everyone both underestimated the Ukrainians and overestimated the Russians. Their performance has been a shit show. The fact that Putin does not control the country and is in fact pulling back and focusing specifically on the east is proof enough that things are going badly.",

            "It seems like Russia is having an issue of occupying Ukraine. But they seem to be destroying the country just fine. It is hard to keep an army in a country, isn't hard to drop bomb after bomb and flatten it. Seems like they will do what they did in 2014, occupy a very small part close to their border where they dont have to spread themselves thin and keep and overarching threat of another full invasion to keep Ukraine from joining NATO.",
            "Having worked off and on with Russia, Ukraine, and a few other FSU states over the last 30 years, as well as being a little bit of a history buff, Russia has a history of using a meat grinder approach to war.  They always have.  Most of the soldiers in Russia's military are 19 and 20 year old kids who don't wanna be there and many are minorities (there are over 100 different ethnic groups in Russia).  The Ukrainians and Russians have intermarried for a thousand years.  So many of them are family.  The story of the common Russian person over the centuries is one of struggle, oppression, and abuse.  Putin is following the same path as the Soviet Leaders before him and the Czars as well.  The Russian \"peasants\" are expendable.  Is there propaganda on both sides?  To varying degrees, of course.  However, despots like Putin and the ilk before him take propaganda to an entirely different level.",
            "Plug for Beau of the Fifth Column on YouTube. I find his analysis and research to be balanced and carry a better understanding of nuance and the situation in Ukraine.  Incidentally, he is also of the opinion that Russia is doing poorly and miscalculated big time. Even when balancing the exaggerated reports from both sides",

            "It\u2019s one of those impossible missions like Afghanistan. No good/clear objectives. If the job was to \u201ckill all Ukrainians\u201d, Russia clearly has more firepower and could do it. They have enough tanks and bombs to flatten everything. \n\nInstead their job is to liberate a country that does not want or need to be liberated. What exactly can a tank do accomplish this mission?",

            "\"Poor job\" is a relative term. Russia is doing a good job in that Ukraine is suffering terribly and sadly stands a good chance and losing the war eventually. Russia is doing a poor job in the sense given their military dominance, they should have been able to win far faster and far more decisively than their current rate of progression.",
            "Both. I'll read something about Russians being pushed farther from Kyiv one day, then some actor/politician dies in a certain city, so I look it up and it's a city just outside Kyiv",
            "I think the fact that it's still going is a sign that it's not going well for Russia. They thought it would be over in a few days",
            "It is important to look at the experience Russia has built in Syria. If you look closely they use a lot of the same tactics as they did in Aleppo. It's the same guy in charge so that's no wonder. The 'humanitairian corridors', destroying homes and infrastructure and waging war on the population. 'Assad or everything burns' was the slogan there. Ukraine is being destroyed as well right now. In Syria Russia kept Assad in charge and deported most of the opposition into Idlib, partly through the humanitarian corridors. If the land is mostly empty and the people have been subjected by terror and lack of basic needs it is free for the taking. However, Ukraine is no Syria; it does not have a population that is so divided, no army that fell apart into militia and an economy that will probably hold for a while. Also the international community is more inclined to help Ukraine than they were to help the opposition in Syria. My guess based on 5 years of working with refugees and seeing war every day? They threw a hail mary trying to get the whole of Ukraine but it was never the main goal. The main goal were just 2 territories, the war is used to spread terror and to deport/kill most of the population in those areas. Then take them and have Ukraine so happy the terror of war is over so Russia can keep those lands.",
            "It\u2019s more of a contradiction of existing propaganda, with movies and TV and the news we have been led to fear Russia as a true rival power militarily instead of taking an actually accurate view based in their capability and performance. That said Russia is underperforming not only for our expectations but also for what they should be capable of. It\u2019s primarily a logistics failure with supply and comms but using conscripts and the general lack of Russian training is showing. It\u2019ll be interesting to see if they learn from their errors and perform better now that they\u2019ve reoriented towards only east Ukraine",
            "You can use some facts to figure this out for yourself to be honest. Let's say every single video post or article since the invasion started is western propaganda. \n\nSo let's turn to the following:\n- Russia GDP 1.48 trillion USD\n- Ukraine GDP 0.15 trillion USD\n- Russia army size 1 million personel wit 2 million in reserve\n- Ukraine army size 0.2 million personel with 0.2 million in reserve\n- Russia outnumbers Ukraine in terms of military equipment by far.\n- Russia has nukes\n- Russia is a covert dictatorship. We know this because Mr Putin changed the constitution so he can serve more than two terms \n\nAnd yet, dispute all of these known facts, they have been unable to conquer Ukraine by now. How is that even possible given the massively superior armed forces? \n\nAnd this is just stats... Then if you look at history you can see that Russia has no problem with commuting crimes against humanity. Is it that hard to believe they're doing it again? China is doing it all day long but we're choosing to ignore that since they are not bothering any western country yet. So is north Korea for that matter but do we care? Nope. \n\nStarting wars in Europe has always caused massive global issues, nobody wants that, so the responses to it is in kind.",

            "So the world expected Russia to steam roll Ukraine. Like first invasion to government captured or in exile inside 2 weeks, then it would just be another instance of Russia dealing with guerilla fighters and \"terrorists\". \n\nThe reason this didn't happen was, rampant corruption. Oligarchs were paid to supply and maintain 1000 fuel trucks with viable fresh fuel and reported that they were ready. When actually it was 700 fuel trucks with old fuel and only 30% full for any of them (this is just an example of the types of things that went on not a real example that I know good sources on). \n\nThings like this happened all over the Russian military. Men were supposed to go through training and were handed to their fellow soldiers to learn by doing. Well if you have an entire squad of new people, who is the old hand to train them? They did not even have the bullets to train them with. If you used ammo you were expected to buy your own replacement. \n\nSo the rich fed on the Russian military and it wasn't till Ukraine that it became apparent. Eventually they realized that they couldn't just push real hard and get the same effect and the Russian forces had to stop and reorganize. I am sure now they are taking full inventories, putting old hand infantry with squads of guys who have no training and a thousand other little things that should have been maintained along the way. \n\nWhat's going to happen from here? Who knows. Maybe Russia will get its shit together, maybe they will find a politically viable way to slowly back off. Maybe they will Nuke Ukraine and events get out of hand and we all go together when we go. Only time will tell.",
            "Ukraine is using propaganda, but all governments at war use propaganda of some form. I think Ukraine\u2019s propaganda has generally been helpful to their cause. Western media is not propaganda free, but even high quality, independent Western journalists have reported that Russia\u2019s war has been largely a failure to this point. It\u2019s indisputable that the retreat from Kyiv represents a major failure for Russia. If you follow high quality unbiased Western reporting on the war, you\u2019ll get good information. It\u2019s good to follow Ukrainian reporting as well, they are closest to the war and reports come out more quickly, but take it with a grain of salt. What Ukrainian officials and journalists say is often meant to help morale at home and rally international support (which is not at all a criticism).",

            "The Russian economy is absolutely fucked. That part is, if anything, understated by many who can't see past a Google exchange rate.\n\nAs to the war effort: Russia has done terribly for the weight they have to throw around, *however* they have a lot of weight to throw around. People are right to laugh at the Russian war effort to the extent that if you ran the simulation 100 times, none of the results should be as poor as it's been. That said, Russia has a lot of resources to lose, human and equipment, and can still \"win\" a war by raw overwhelming numbers - a strategy that has consistently worked through Russian history. \n\nThat said, Ukraine is the defending army and modern warfare is defined by asymmetry. If anything the most unconventional aspect to this war is how conventional it has been: wars aren't really fought like this has been fought anymore (and such fact is arguably a point to obsolete doctrines in the Russian army). Even if Russia does win, if only because of occupation and agreed ceasefire, any projection of long term war prospects that doesn't account for insurgency, NGOs and the new modern convention of asymmetrical warfare should be dismissed as ignorance.",

Unless of course someone is convinced these too are fake, but those kind of people will not accept any evidence unless they were personally placed in a combat zone and saw it with their own eyes.\n\nAs for the propaganda, absolutely we are being fed propaganda, the only reliable sources have been small groups like Oryx that only document incidents on visual identifiers through experts. Everything media covers will have a tiny trickle of truth between gallons of exaggeration or misinformation (not always intentional, but sometimes will be)\n\nBeing Skeptical is the safest bet, and referencing information gathered since the collapse of the Soviet Union has shown that modern russia is not the soviet bear they once were, and unfortunately for them they have not caught up with how warfare has changed.\n\nIt's so incredibly brutal and depressing for all sides involved. I feel for the average russian that doesn't want this war and my heart goes out to the innocent Ukrainians that have lost their homes and lives to what is quite literally just a failing powerplay by one of the last major dictatorships of a bygone era.",
            "This can only be assessed in perspective. Right now, there is no way of knowing what Russia's expectations were, or what objectives they have. We may be being fed pure propaganda, or we may be getting the absolute truth. We will find out in some years, reality will most likely fit in the middle of the options, with a varying truth to propaganda ratio.",

They will keep doing this over and over.\n\nTheir propaganda, even if they retreat, shows they won because they are removing children from \"Nazi's\" and getting the children to Russian homes.   The people in Russia are shown loving families adopting the children from the area of the special military operation.",

            "Old thread, thousands of comments, but I will still point something out I haven't read. People think of propaganda as made up. But that's not what propaganda (usually) is. Propaganda is about promoting a particular thought or feeling about the world or particular events. The best propaganda is the propaganda that doesn't have to stretch reality or manufacture events to fulfill its goal.\n\nSo, a journalist's report can be factual *and* propaganda at the same time. This is why the US army is so happy to help Hollywood films and in general (other than classified material) is happy to let documenters in.\n\nThe second best kind of propaganda is taking some event and explaining it or presenting it with a spin towards the propaganda's goal. This is the kind that is hard to discern.\n\nThe worst kind of propaganda is having to misrepresent something that happened on the basis of technicalities or straight up lie, in order to keep up an image. On this range there are plenty of strategies that can be best represented by the latest strategies used by Russia and in the long string of anti-democratic governments proliferating in the world today.\n\nHere's the kicker. For the opposite side or neutral parties, the last kind of propaganda might seem obvious. But for the person used to exist on either the first or second type of propaganda, the third is seamless. For the propaganda operator, distrusts in all sources of truth is a victory on itself. If you don't trust anyone, you can't go against the hegemonic truth.",
            "Maybe not the best idea to try and get an unibased opinion from the pretty much the epicenter of the propaganda which is reddit. \n\nWhy do you think that the top comments in here will have a different narrative as opposed to the frotn page or any other mainstream subreddit.\n\nThis is a website for woke western nationalists to circlejerk with each other and participate in pro western disinformation campaigns. I couldnt think of a worse place to ask.",
            "Putin may be an asshole - though to what degree is heavily debatable because opinions of him are absolutely influenced by propaganda - but he\u2019s very intelligent. There\u2019s multiple things to consider:\n\n1. As others have pointed out, Russia is treated as if the USSR still exists. The White House and media outlets talk about Russia as this massive evil entity but seldom gives examples.\n\n2. When there are examples given, they\u2019re framed poorly to make the US look good and Russia look bad. The US stands firm that Russia, under direction of the Kremlin, ran a massive big brain campaign to influence the election. The reality is cybersecurity in the US is piss poor, the majority of Americans can\u2019t think critically for themselves, and social media deserves a lot more blame than it gets for contributing to the rise in major societal issues.\n\n3. Russia was formed from the USSR. With exception, countries who left were free from becoming Russia. It wasn\u2019t Russia who determined Ukraine was no longer part of the USSR and thus the reformed Russia, it was Ukraine and their allies. There\u2019s hypocrisy in the fact when Texas \u201cjoked\u201d about seceding, the response was \u201ceven if every state and American citizen agreed, it won\u2019t happen because the constitution disallows it.\u201d In other words, the US believes not a single inch of US territory can EVER, no matter who says what, leave the control of the US, full stop; BUT the US believes it has the authority to say a country that wanted to secede had every right to do so and Russia is evil for trying to stop it.\n\n4. Again, Putin is not an idiot, and he\u2019s allegedly mentioned playing 4D chess by \u201cinvading Ukraine.\u201d It\u2019s not off the table that Russia is putting on a show to demonstrate the instability of foreign governments. Even if that\u2019s not the case, it\u2019s happening as Biden\u2019s handling of the situation has been lukewarm at best, a national entstandenen at worst. \n\nInstead of trying to come to any answers, the intelligent thing to do (of course, looking at the past many presidents, unlikely) is to maintain a big stick philosophy instead of trying to buddy up with Putin (which he clearly didn\u2019t care about) or threaten him (which he also does not care about.) world leaders should be keeping quiet on the matter, send resources for Ukraine to defend themselves as reasonable under agreements, but largely shut the hell up.",

            "Ukrainian here. I\u2019m not a military expert so I can\u2019t speak on the rest, but I do know that Russia receives almost a billion euros for gas and oil from the EU every day. The idea that sanctions are actually tanking the Russian economy is ridiculous in light of that. The only people who are affected by the sanctions are average people in Russia, but Putin has plenty of money for this war. The media isn\u2019t talking about that enough because it would probably outrage people. It certainly outrages me.",
            "Russia failed the \u201cblitzkrieg\u201d phase so now they are doing the usual soviet shit: plundering and destroying cities and infrastructure, while kidnapping children and killing local population. It\u2019s a war of attrition for them now. Slow, sloppy, inhumane. Yup, Soviet ways never die.",
            "Ukraine is getting destroyed and western media has lied to us about it. Everyone thinks Russia was trying to take Kyiv, but in reality it was a feint. A feint that will be studied for years at western war colleges. The Russians were able to convince not just Ukraine, but the entire world that they were stupid enough to try to take the capital with some paratroopers. What this did was prevent reinforcements from going to the east (which is where most of the real fighting has been). Right now, the Russians have basically surrounded the Ukrainian army that was in the east (which btw was about to invade the Donbas and end the civil war thats been going on there for the last 8 years). Russia beat Ukraine to the punch and invaded first.\n\nThey've also pushed west along the coast and are threatening Odessa. However, the Russians aren't necessarily about conquering big cities right now. They had to in Mariopol because they was a large Ukrainian force there of about 14k. Those troops have been pretty much destroyed at this point.\n\nAs well, the Russians have destroyed almost all the Ukrainian tanks and armored vehicles. As well, they've destroyed most of the fuel depots, so even the tanks that are still there, they can't go anywhere. Once the Army in the east (which is believed to have been around 60k, though some have estimated upto 100k) is destroyed, it will be game over. The Russian army will start to move west and begin to take real territory once that happens and it may result in the complete collapse of Ukraine, like happened to France in the beginning of WW2.\n\nWhat us in the west aren't understanding is that the Russians are fighting an old school manuever war. They aren't worried about taking cities, they are about taking out the armies. If the armies are destroyed, the will to fight of the populace and the leaders will collapse. Our media has no idea what is really happening in Ukraine (or worse they do and are lying to us about it).",
            "Kinda odd I never hear about Ukrainian military deaths, only Russian.",
            "Propaganda 100%",
            "In 2014, Russia rolled over the Ukrainian defenses in the Donbas and Crimea with basically no meaningful resistance. Ukraine has spent the intervening time getting their military squared away. When Russia sauntered in expecting a repeat of 2014, they got their asses handed to them. \n\nTo give you an idea of how badly Russia misjudged the situation: their paratroopers landed with dress uniforms for a parade. This salient went so badly for them that they had to abandon their thrust towards Kyiv. Russia\u2019s been losing so many men and so much war materiel that they\u2019ve called up 60,000 reservists. \n\nThis is not what a Russian victory looks like. This is *bad* for them. The Ukrainian propaganda is certainly in full swing, but this war has been a string of disasters and miscalculations for Moscow. This is a country that wants to oppose the West getting its ass handed to it by a regional power. \n\nThe balance of power still favors Russia, simply because of the assets they can bring to bear, but this invasion has been a debacle on par with the first Italian invasion of Ethiopia."

If you don't have the card to be able to present the number along with the security code on the back\u2014also with your signature on it by the way, that part is a lot more important than people think, I also worked for a while in customer service for a credit card company and I can't tell you how many calls I had to take where a customer was being declined a charge because the retailer asked to verify the signature but they didn't have anything to compare it to\u2014they might decline the transaction. Worst case scenario, they might even call someone suspecting you of credit card fraud. A lot of retail employees could give a shit less, they don't get paid enough to deal with that sort of thing, etc, but I have known some cashiers in the multiple places that I have worked retail that would have absolutely jumped on the possibility of ruining someone's day because they just get so pissed off at customers in general that they will take any petty vengeance they can.",

Actually I laughed because \"is it a red flag\" sounds like an understatement but it's really serious when you get down to it. It's hard to find an appropriate reaction when someone you fell in love with asks you something like that. 'Just say no' is a lot easier said than done with someone who will have no second thoughts about using emotional blackmail to get what they want, let alone leaving a relationship she's emotionally invested herself into with a partner who may play the victim or make himself look vulnerable to guilt trip her into staying (\"Why are you doing this to me?\", \"I can't continue without you\", etc.)\n\nI tried to help a (male) friend out of a toxic relationship in the past, it's not easy but it is even less so for the friend who is in that situation since they're the one who's under pressure from their partner. It think it takes a lot of listening and understanding to help them out of it because from their perspective you think without all that pressure on you. From a theoretical point of view, \"is it a red flag if he wants me to delete all my male contacts?\" is a 'well duh' question, but from a practical point of view it's hard to act on that red flag. When my friend talked to me about his relationship, I immediately noticed the red flags, told him about them, got personally mad at his girlfriend (I mean not to her face but between him and me). This is not the way to go, all it did was make him believe I was jealous and shrug it off.

I put a TL;DR but it's very worth it to check out all the links I tagged in this.\n\nTL;DR - It's not about money. Everything Google presents you is a social experiment to see how you will interact with what they put in front of you. Google intentionally inconveniences you as part of the experiment. All of that data is collected, attributed to the personal profile they have of you and used educate their machine learning and artificial intelligences, just like in the movie Ex Machina. Google will probably be first to create sentient AI. Here's their progress from 2 years ago so they of course are farther along now. [Google's AI Assistant Can Now Make Real Phone Calls](https://youtu.be/JvbHu_bVa_g) \n\nThe Daily Mail and Forbes report Alphabet (Google's parent company founded by Google executives) is valued at over 1 trillion dollars. Google is by no means struggling financially and does not NEED to spam the whole internet with ads so then why do they do it? There are many reasons and none of them as simple as greed. I have a friend who used to work at Google X (Google's own Area 51 branch) and he's confirmed to me many times how Google is the most brilliant, nefarious company on earth. \n\nIt's not about money. Everything Google presents you is a social experiment to see how you will interact with what they put in front of you. Google (and Facebook and Amazon) track how you INTERACT with a page's information ([Google and Facebook are watching our everyone move online.](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/31/google-facebook-data-privacy-concerns-out-of-control-commentary.html) ). \nThis means how long you hover over an item with the mouse, how long you keep your screen positioned on certain objects, what you do and don't click on, how long you stay on a certain link or page, how have you interacted with similar links/objects in the past and much more. They have a system in place that measures where they think your eyes are focused when looking at the screen. Google intentionally inconveniences you as part of the experiment in order to see how you will react (Facebook got in trouble for the same things years ago but everybody does it now [Facebook's secret psychological experiment on users.](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/02/facebook-sorry-secret-psychological-experiment-users) ). All of this data is collected, attributed to the hugely intricate personal profile they have of you and used educate their machine learning and artificial intelligences, just like in the movie Ex Machina. In that movie, the genius founder of a tech company similar to Google funnels all the information from the world's search history into an AI to potentially create sentience. Google's legitimately doing the same thing. I am not a conspiracy theorist and I mean this in the most literal, non-sensationalist way but Google genuinely wants world domination thorough tech. Not money, not simply power or influence, but the ability to manipulate the minds and lives of the masses however they please. It's the closest power trip to being a god. The more you read insightful tech news with insider knowledge, the more you come to see this is true.\n\nEDIT: Forgot to say, if you really care about your privacy, which we all should, then you should use Firefox as your default browser with AdBlockPlus and DuckDuckGo.com as your search engine. These are the only major players who don't track you and sell your data. Also check your privacy settings on all social media because you have more options than you realize, and finally, you can turn off the extreme default personalization of Google Ad Services if you want.

And if you search for something like \"big bananas linked to blah blah blah because blah blah blah\" instead of getting specific query you will still get \"why bananas are healthy\" and nowhere will you get a single article even trying to answer the thing you're looking for.\n\nPopularity of the article and of the website itself seems to be weighted far more important than answering the actual querry.\n\n\nduckduckgo is just as useless\n\nbing.com can sometimes be better actually, but nowhere near Google's former levels of fame.\n\nI think this might be a result of search engine optimization too.",

            "This is a complicated question. Let me first start by sayin that most of the ultra wealthy have wealth through assets, either physical property or stock ownership NOT through income. When we say Musk is worth 200B, most of that is assets. His liquid wealth, while still substantial, is likely much much smaller, maybe a few hundred million. You also must understand that money is not the same to the wealthy as it is to us. Money for them is a tool used to create more wealth. Anything which diminishes that tool must be minimized in order to maximize the usefulness of the tool. Basically we have a few motivating factors here, one is the desire to sustain a lavish lifestyle utilizing a much smaller amount of liquid assets, so paying 25% of 300 million will actually lower their ability to own all those fancy houses and yachts and rub elbows with politicians and officials. Second, is the desire to utilize wealth to productively to make more wealth. While a few million less may not be substantial, those few million may be worth 10x or 100x if properly invested, so the pain of that tax is many times multiples. Third the desire to avoid taxes on assets which is a whole separate discussion around property rights, but when 98% percent of your worth is in assets, you sure don\u2019t want that to happen.",

            "Because after a certain point it isn't money any more, it's just a high score.\n\nNobody can reasonably spend a billion dollars on themselves. It's just an absolutely insane amount of money. So the difference in lifestyle and purchasing power between 1 billion and 500 billion is really meaningless. At that point it isn't money, it's a score that you want to run up so you're richer than your rich friends or just because you are compulsive about \"winning\" at finance.",
            "Because most people take whatever deductions they are allowed to take.",
            "They do but it's not perceived like people think. Most millionaires/billionaires do not have liquid capital and are sitting around like Scrooge McDuck. They have stock portfolios, IRAs, 401ks, own real estate, own business. These items are only worth what people are willing to buy them at. Stock market crashes then you're screwed. Business goes under, screwed. Property values tank, screwed. Want to sell the business/property? Then it's only worth the selling price. What the wealthy end up doing is they take out loans or lines of credit at the bank. The bank knows they're rich because they own amazon (Bezos) so the risk of defaulting is low. Sometimes they trade it for their company stock. \n\nOverall, people get taxed on yearly income or capital gains. If you dont claim an income... no tax. Your business took a loss? No corporate tax this year. Capital gains tax kicks in once you pull out of your portfolio. \n\nCant tax you for spending your loan money (yet).",
            "To answer, I'm gonna rephrase the question: why would *regular people* try so hard to avoid paying taxes?  \n\nAnother similar question would be: Do you use coupons when available? Do you look for various rebates etc when buying a new phone?\n\nAnd this behavior isn't specific to the rich. HR block, turbo tax etc heavily, almost exclusively base their ads on maximizing deductions and tax credits, and those ads are targeting the average citizen, not the rich. \n\nSorry to answer your question with a question, but: Why would anyone willingly pay more than they need to?\n\nRegardless of how people feel about the rich, they generally dont get rich by simply wasting/unecessarily spending money. Some studies place 88% of millionaires as \"self made\" meaning they didn't start rich, and more likely than not had to put considerable effort into minimizing costs/expenses. That is not a skillset that just evaporates at an arbitrarily determined level of wealth. \n\nAre there problems with our tax system and how the different deductions and incentives work? Sure, but that's a different question and a different conversation.",

            "There are a couple of sides to this. At one point as one amasse wealth, one learns to keep it close or working to make more money by avoiding taxes (legally) which makes one even richer. The other side is that the billionaires understand that taxes are like a game. Has you play better, you get less taxes. If you can avoid paying taxes and keep it as capital which can be reinvested to make more money and generate more value to the economy, you are not cheating the system, you just better control where the money goes and how it's used in the economy. \n\nOf course there is the greedy kind that will cheat on their taxes but these are amateurs. There are plenty of loopholes build in the tax systems to exploit and legally reduce taxes.",

There are multiple accounting firms competing for that business through a combination of their fees and the amount of money they can save the rich person in taxes. \n\nThe wealthy individual is not setting up offshore accounts or tracking their receipts or lobbying for tax law changes. They go to lawyers and accounts and pay them.",

            "Relative to the amount of money they keep, the amount they personally do or spend to reduce their tax burden is probably fairly small. I suspect that at that level of wealth the process is almost automatic from the billionaire's perspective. \n\nAs to why bother, I doubt there's a level of wealth at which you suddenly think, 'That's enough.' Your wealth generates more wealth, and a lot of people other than you have a stake in perpetuating it. Having it is better than not having it, and it costs you barely anything to gain more. Even if you do decide to give it to people with greater need, like Bill Gates, you'd probably prefer to give it away to the people you choose in the style you choose. I'm sure Bezos has just as many objections to how the government spends his tax money as the average American does.",

Like mentioned, some say it\u2019s natural some say it\u2019s an extreme bordering insanity, just depends on which perspective you take.\n\nTL;DR it\u2019s complicated, but I\u2019d say greed is good enough as an answer most of the time.",

            "There's a few layers to unpack here. It's not that they actively try hard to avoid them - the thing is, the government encourages people to own businesses and to invest, so they throw in  tax incentives to do so (e.g. business expenses are tax deductible, selling stocks after 1 year will get you less tax fees, etc.). \n\nThese sorts of rules (in theory) create jobs, value, and innovation while a business owner or investor will choose to abide by them in exchange to get their kid's tuition, their mom's hospital bills, or if all is going well, a new car. They probably could do it either way like you say, but if we were in their shoes and know all the tax \"cheat codes\", we'd probably be doing the same thing.",

Evading taxes is a patriotic duty to defund the regime and eventually collapse. I shit on Kirchner and I also shit on Maduro. There is a war between the citizen and the dictatorship, and the way to destroy it without falling into a civil war is to strangle them financially.

            "IT'S MY MONEY AND I NEED IT NOW",
            "There's also a facet to this that people don't tend to consider for whatever reason, which is simply, why wouldn't they try to avoid taxes?  We are upset that billionaires don't pay enough in taxes, which is fair, but it's up to the government to tax them appropriately, not up to the billionaires to be like \"Well, my taxes were only $140k this year, but I tacked on a couple million more, get yourself something pretty.\"  Let me tell you, when it's time to do taxes, I'm looking for every legal deduction I can take, the same as they would do.  \nPlease don't take this as me stating billionaires shouldn't pay more, it's rather the opposite.  It's up to the government to raise the taxes on the millionaires and billionaires to make them pay what they legally owe.  The problem is the implication with a question like this is that they don't pay what they legally owe, and that's generally not the case.  They will, and do, exploit every possible loophole to avoid being taxed, as would I, and most likely anyone here would, too, who's smart.  The trick is to close those legal and quasi-legal loopholes.  \nIn the 50's, the upper tax bracket on earnings over $5M in a year was 90%.  If you're not familiar with tax brackets that means ONLY the amount you make OVER $5M is taxed at 90%.  The secret of this trick wasn't the government trying to take 90% of their money, the the trick was that reinvesting in your business, paying your employees better wages, paying for pensions, investing in the arts and sciences, all of those things are tax deductible.  So as a millionaire, if I make $6M, I can either give $900,000 of that last million to the US government, or I can set up the 'Regional Memorial Hospital Richter12x2 Cancer Ward'.  That makes me look good, saves me money, and helps the community for a long time to come.  Which was what was intended.  Reinvest the wealth in the community versus hoarding it.  As a millionaire, would you rather have another increment in the bank account, or a literal building with your name on it you can drive by each day as a reminder of what a hot shot and all around good guy you are?  \nEventually though, the people who write the laws and tax brackets were replaced by people who really didn't understand the strategy of the system, and the tax rates were lowered.  Then at some point, millionaires and billionaires figured out how buying politicians could also possibly be a tax deduction if it was done by their corporation, which is also a person on its own for the purposes of wrong-doing, and now we are where we are, electing politicians who we thought represented our interests, but who end up voting for whatever their corporate sponsors tell them, and pushing through whatever bills are written for them.",

If the government came to you and say they were going to take an additional $5k in taxes, would you object?  After all, you're not \"starving\".\n\nI've built my wealth from literally nothing, and I'll be damned if I'm going to just give it away to the government to watch them piss it away on stupid shit, run up our national debt, then turn around and have the fucking NERVE to demand more money from me.\n\nThat's why.  When the government starts spending money responsibly, THEN I'll look into giving them more taxes if needed.",
            "This is some dumb shit I\u2019m reading. None of this even makes sense. These super rich people, do they have more money then they know what to do with? Yes. But is it all cash sitting in a bank account? Hell no. Most of the accumulated wealth comes from holding stock in their own business. What? You want them to sell off all their stocks, no longer hold any shares of their own company, and give it away? Like yes I agree they can and should do more but the majority of their wealth is tied into their own business. Can you imagine the ripple effect that would occur if a CEO or founder of the company sold off billions $ of shares in their own company. Imagine if Bezos just sold billions of his own stock off. The company would lose so much money as people would begin panic selling their own stocks and price per share would plummet literally just evaporating wealth into thin air.

I worked for a few years in Beverly Hills  for a couple of pretty wealthy guys who drove Bentleys and Lamborghinis and who had many properties and art collections. Their day job was a business where they employed mostly illegal aliens from all over the world which I ran crews of all over the country. They had a little side thing connected to the business where they traded labor for huge quantities of used furniture that was sold at auction and they got a little percentage of the money from that. I was once given $5,000 by an auctioneer and told to give it to Udi and Paul when I got back to L.A. These guys split the money up and literally danced around the office holding it on high and giggling like school girls. It was pocket change that meant nothing to them. I had to entertain clients with or without other employees higher up the food chain and we would spend $5,000 on 4 or 5 guys eating and drinking and going to topless bars. When I found a client who was opposed to topless entertainment if we were in one of a few states where it was legal I would go shoot machine guns with them spending several thousand dollar.

            "Because they don't-- they do pay taxes like anyone else... The US Tax code is complicated and is progressive based on adjusted gross income. Now, the wealthy have many adjustments and non-liquid assets, which may render they annual taxes smaller, but not due to tax evasion, but due to deferred liquidation, or in other words, due to the fact that they do bot keep their income in liquid assets, thus not paying income taxes on them. However, this doesn't mean that they won't pay taxes upon the liquidation of the said assets. Another little circumstance that helps the rich to pay less taxes is the long-term rate on capital gains, which is significantly lower than plain income tax. This is because the long-term investments are encouraged by the state to spur business activity and economic growth.\n\nAll-in--all, the rich probably wind up paying more taxes than lower 50% of the income bracket. It is just that relative to the amount they earned or have the amount paid in taxes seems to be insignificant, when compared to the median income family's tax burden in absolute dollar terms. This is, obviously, due to the vast disparity in incomes, and not to the tax cheating or tax breaks.\n\nI think overall, the progressive tax code in the US is fair and much lower than elsewhere in the developed world...",

Their net worth is based on shares of the companies they founded that that are holding but not selling.  Selling the shares would dilute their voting power and control over the company.  This would be like saying my net worth is $1m based on the value of my paid off house and retirement accounts.  Neither of those are liquid at this point.  \n\nSo if Elon musk is assessed a tax of $20B as was implied he would need to sell or transfer to the federal government 2m shares of Tesla stock. This dilutes his holdings and voting power in the company.  He likely has paid minimal taxes in the past by not selling shares, which incurs tax liabilities but borrowing against shares used as collateral.  Since the loans are not income he does not have to pay taxes on that money he pulls for spending. It\u2019s an interesting approach really only available to the truely wealthy.   For me to leverage the value of my assets I would have to get a loan on my house and use it as collateral or a loan gain at my retirement accounts. I wouldn\u2019t want to do that because it affects my future retirement plans. So even though I may have a $1m net worth it is not really very accessible. \n\nMusk is in a different boat.

That is where the government steps in. The one flaw of capitalism is that greed and infinite wealth is a goal, the market does not price greed down. The market optimizes for the valuation of goods/services, but this is where it gets tricky because value/income produced by the \"proletariat\", the workers, trickles up to the managers, manager's managers, etc, etc. What you often pay for is \"infrastructure\", which are basically other capitalists working together to maximize profit.\n\nAll of this is to say, it's an oxymoron.

The SCOTUS has ruled on this numerous times, it IS a tax and is NOT for ANY specified purpose whatsoever, not even anyone's retirement.

People will always serve their own best interests first. True, some take advantage and go too far, but if there were an evenly apportioned tax as the Constitution originally called for, everyone could far more easily  become rich themselves.\n\nWhy worry about what the ultra wealthy have or do? Why not worry about making yourself ultra wealthy instead? Want to be egalitarian and help everyone else that isn't smart enough to make themselves wealthy? Hey fine, it's YOUR money, do whatever you want with it. But NEVER assume anything to be given to you by the effort of others.

            "Oof. This is giving me flashbacks to my quarter life crisis. Honestly, I think we've been taught to think a career/job is supposed to be fulfilling, give you purpose and satisfaction, blahblahblah. Eventually you realize that's bs for 99% of the world and most of human history. A job just pays the bills. What you do outside of it is where most people find meaning. It's a bit morbid, but read some obituaries in your local papers. The most interesting ones don't talk about their jobs.",
            "This is how I used to feel in college, but I had no clue what I wanted to do so that's what caused it which led me to drop out. My first job at a gas station didn't make me feel any better because I was treated like garbage, then I was a busser at a sports bar/alehouse place which had the same problem (except the one manager who was awesome to me, fuck yeah he was great.) Then I landed a job as a plumbers apprentice, and it really has reinvigorated my love for living. Tldr I have disliked living for most of my (short) life but being able to do something as important as fixing people's plumbing or repairing their BFPs has been a great experience. I feel like I have a reason to live since I'm enjoying this job and am doing something that helps people directly, as lame as it may sound. Also my family has been a big help the whole way helping me stay sane :)",

            "That's the thing about work - for most of us life isn't about work. Having a dream job is an idea instilled into us at a young age but very few people actually do, and of those very few get to do it. \n\nSo it becomes about the reward. 50 years ago that deal was working a full time job and getting to own a house, support a family, and put money into your true passions. \n\nNow you need to go into massive debt to get the kind of education the job market demands. Regular jobs don't cut it for independant survival any more, never mind saving any money. Cost of living is so high that dual-income parents can't support their kids. Property is nearly inaccessible to anyone born in the last thirty years. \n\nAnd in response to this we're constantly told to just try harder. Pull yourself up by your bootstraps, get a side hustle. It's a degrading system, the alternative to which is homelessness. People get up every day because they have no choice. There's nothing wrong with you. We just weren't meant to live this way.",

Those were the ones where I genuinely liked my coworkers.",
            "I love this post. I\u2019m depressed and have been for years and have wondered the same thing. If you don\u2019t make a certain income and/or are living paycheck-to-paycheck and you\u2019re not passionate about your work, I really don\u2019t understand how people do that for years on end. I\u2019m only 25 and I was fed up with working years ago to the point that I even became suicidal. Maybe I have a sense of entitlement having grown up with many things given to me admittedly, but even if that hadn\u2019t been the case I\u2019m pretty sure I would still feel similar, maybe further down the road. I don\u2019t know how people go for 40 years spending 1/3 of their lives doing something they hate. Many people respond to that with reasons such as having kids or family members to take care of, and while I respect that, it still sounds depressing to have to sign away a third of your life just to make ends meet for yourself and a few other people.\n\nNot to change the subject but I really feel as though the current wealth gap at least in the U.S. is a main contributor to why so many people have to live this way. It\u2019s unfortunate. I\u2019m not hating on people that have become successful, but more than 50% of all wealth is in the hands of 1% of the people. This is what creates the unhealthy work-life balance that many people experience while people like Jeff Bezos and Oprah have multiple homes which are unoccupied for most of the year. Spaces which could very well be inhabited by people that would be more than happy to live there full-time.\n\nUltimately time is money. Everybody knows that. So following that logic, if there is someone such as Jeff Bezos or Bill Gates that could never work another day in their life and still be more than comfortable, that means that proportionately, logically, and inevitably, there are going to be numerous people that will never get to experience what it\u2019s like to have more than 8 hours of down time per day (really 5-6 or even less if you count commuting and taking care of other responsibilities).",
            "Because not having money sucks more. I've fallen into a job which I 'dont mind', I do however put absolutely minimal effort in to not get fired and as soon as I leave I don't think about work at all, I refuse to look at emails ect at home.

Not a big fan of my job, but I don't think about the in terms of \"job well done\" or \"task fulfilment.\" \n\nBut I have hobbies that my job funds and that's what I focus on. I buy Magic cards I really want to build the best decks I can. I buy rare collectibles to add to my collection. I buy hard to find anime that I've always wanted. I buy video games or old consoles and stuff like that. \n\nMy job is merely a means to an end and since I started looking at it that way, it's greatly improved my mood. I just leased a 2000 Blazer that I'm taking on extra work to get paid off as quickly as possible so I can start building it into a badass 4X4 trail rider. \n\nIt doesn't work for everyone, but if there are things you like doing then focus on those to get you through the day. I've struggled with Depression since I was 13, and I'm 32 now. I've only recently taken on this mentality and it's greatly improved my work days.",
            "I used to feel that way in my 20s. Im in a field I love but back then I was in junior positions that had awful balance and terrible managers. My daughter probably literally saved my life. It started to fade when I started making over 70k, I felt like I could breethe. Once I hit 100k all of the bs mostly stopped bothering me. \n\nThe main point here is that people are happier when they dont feel crushed by making no money in a deadend job.",

So I work, and in the end I might have to work until I'm dead, and ultimately all my effort will make someone else rich, while I just barely get by.

            "I remember how I felt when I didn't have a job, I was a financial and interpersonal burden on the people who cared enough about me to take care of me, and I felt like I had no control of my life to change any of that. Wished like hell I could have a simple, relatively low-stress 9 to 5 so I could rebuild my social life and that would enable me to cover my own expenses so I could contribute with the bills and buy some cigarettes or snacks without feeling like a goddamn parasite.\n\nNow, when my alarm goes off and I have 30 minutes to get clean and dressed to get out the door for my hour-long commute to work, I count my blessings. I have some friends at work that are happy to see me and I have a little bit of money to buy things I want once in a while.

            "The secret is to half ass it. I don\u2019t get paid for the work I do but the time I spend in the office. So I just Reddit most of the day. Chat with coworkers and with friends online. Just generally don\u2019t give a shit. Watch the movie \u201coffice space\u201d. It has an important message. You only get fired if you have an argument with your boss. Not if you are almost useless at work. Of course you will have to do some work to be almost but not entirely useless but that\u2019s like one hour per day. \n\nAnd doing that gives you money for a pc, video games and more interesting activities on the weekends. \n\nDon\u2019t take your job too seriously.

            "We are simply not evolved to live in the society we've created. Hunter-gatherers \"worked\" for an average of 4 hours every day doing their hunting and gathering. The resto of the time was spent with their families and friends: their tribe, the people that they loved. Sure, they had plenty of other stressors, including a shorter lifespan, high infant mortality, deadly disease and animals, etc., but they were external stressors that the mind had millions of years to evolve to deal with. HGs weren't worried about money or politics.\n\nOur HG brains are not equipped to deal with 50 hour work plus all the other shit in life. u/poop_wagon, you are not alone, and feeling like this is completely normal.\n\nMy best advice is to take up meditation, because the structure of society is not gonna change any time soon. \"We can't control what happens to us in life, but we can control the way we experience it.\"  \n\n\n*Edited for grammar*",
            "I have no idea what you do for a living, but (and this is just a suggestion) maybe you should try doing something either more physical or something that involves creating/building something? My most satisfying job I\u2019ve ever had was being a farm hand. It didn\u2019t pay well but I always felt contentment at the end of the day. Also, I\u2019ve always felt better \u201cmentally\u201d after a long day of physically demanding work. Maybe I\u2019m alone with this opinion but it\u2019s worth a shot, especially if you\u2019re at the point where you are questioning whether you should even be alive. A carpenter or house builder always seemed like they would be satisfying careers, as well. Just my two cents",
            "You must get to the point where you do not get up for the job. Unless you omit for the sake of privacy aspects of your life (which would be perfectly legit), it sounds like main part of your day is the job. My motivation improved when I got a cat (or you can get any other pet, I just like cats) and I knew I'm getting up to play and give food before going to work. Going home from work I would not be drenched in cloud of \"this job sucks\". I would be automatically caught in \"is the cat waiting on the window, or just sleeping\" and these small little things help to improve jo psychological hygiene. Getting some hobbies that are far from work and if possible active (sitting home with Netflix or games leads often to idle thoughts) helps as well.\n\nSo I get out because of cat(s) and airsoft.

            "Because we have to. Sure I'd rather be dead but I don't want to die. That means I need food, water, and shelter which means I need money. That's where the job comes in. Some people luck out and are born with the drive others find enjoyment in work but most of us suffer through it. \n\nJust have to find your reason for pushing through the muck. Don't do it for family, it can lead to resentment. Me ? I need to be able to support my fishing habits. So while I gruel through a work day I remind myself of the fish. \n\nFind your fish and the work day might get more bearable",
            "I think you're not alone! I got to the point where I began to sob in the shower before going to work. The whole thing about worker alienation Marx talked about is real and in our time it's getting worse. Capitalism, whether you are for or against it, does have this effect on the working class, and all of us who aren't owners are workers plain and simple. The idea of a middle class , while a handy descriptor for some discussion of social values, is really just a way to keep the working class divided and our attention away from the owners who run society.\n\nAs workers, everything we do belongs to somebody else. Our creativity, our dedication, our altruistic intentions, all of it belongs to the owner class.  It's no wonder we feel lost and alone.",

            "I don't.\n\nI get out of bed each morning for other reasons. \n\nA job isn't one of them.\n\nI don't do my job because I like it. I do my job because it makes me money and that gives me the ability to do things that I do like.\n\nBut I would say, if you live in the United States, that economic system is very draining and heavy on the shoulders, it very much beats down their employees, no holiday, no days off, low pay, low benefits, it's truly awful and I don't blame anyone for being depressed in such a system, because it works hard to take away the benefits of life.\n\nI got out of bed this morning because I wanted to take a walk and think about things, life, the world, things I wanted to see and visit. Work is just something, one of the things, that I do. It's not who I am, or all that I do. I enjoy going out and helping people, so when I walk to work, that's an opportunity for me to find chances I can help people. Even if it's something as simple as picking up an extra apple and giving it to someone else.\n\nThat helps I think. Finding what does make you happy and just doing that. I feel rewarded from helping others and experiencing new things. Work just gives me money to do that.",

She works 12 hour days but only for 3 days and has 4 days to herself to do what she enjoys. She only has a high school diploma as far as I know so degrees aren\u2019t even necessarily that integral (not useless, I have a degree and proud of it, but it\u2019s not always necessary).\n\nI hope you can find your passion.

            "I tried for a decade and it just got worse and worse every day. Asshole bosses, out of touch corporate, sycophantic coworkers, pretentious team building exercises, making our lives harder just for the hell of it, every employee acting like they will be ceo one day if they kiss the right asses... I hated every single aspect of office life.\n\nSo I cut my expenses, moved back home, do a little part time freelance stuff and my stress levels have gone from 98% to almost nothing. I don't have plans of starting a family or buying fancy things, so what's the point in busting my ass and making myself miserable. Work may be life for a lot of people, but it's just not the life for me.",
            "I compartmentalize. I go to my job and basically go into robot mode. Just get it done. Then I leave work and go back into human mode. I just try to enjoy my time away from work. It\u2019s a balance and it\u2019s not exactly ideal but I look at it like I am privileged to have the opportunity and ability to work.",
            "I completely understand what you're saying here. I [24M] have been working ever since I turned 16. I moved out at 19 and have had to work full time ever since. I have been absolutely miserable at every single job I've worked at. It felt purposeless doing a job I didn't give a shit about. Plus, if you add a dickhead abusive manager who treats you like shit into the equation and he will make going to work everyday absolutely miserable. It's the equivalent of waking up every morning and driving directly to you're bully's house just to hangout for 8 hours straight.\n\nAfter bouncing around from job to job I began feeling helpless and like something was wrong with me. I've walked out of multiple jobs due to the fact that I was so miserable going into work everyday and doing something I wasn't passionate about. That's when I decided enough was enough and started on my path to get an education. I'm now studying computer animation and I am happy to say I am chasing my dreams and will one day be working in a job field I am truly passionate about.  In the meantime I found a job that actually works for me and I'm not actually miserable at. I get to work alone (no boss, no manager, no coworkers) and listen to interesting podcasts all day. I feel like I have more control over my day and my decisions and I'm trusted to do my job while no one is watching. It's the perfect job for me to be doing while I'm getting my education. Things are finally falling into place for me.",

            "I see it as a duty to society. In the end, others are working fulltime to  conceptualize, test, manage, create and finish products you can use. In all industries.Your car. The house you grew up in. With materials farmed, processed and assembled by workers. By regular people (if your father didnt build it with his own hands). \n\nFor example. I recently purchased a VR headset. Researched, developed and materials gathered and processed by hundreds if not thousands of people in the process. I've paid it with my hard earned money. That i got for being productive for society. Its not much. I dont even know where exactly it ends up but its just some industrial material thats gonna be usefull for someone somehwere else. Its a giving and taking.\n\nPeople have to stop seeing themself as something special. Were all cogs in a big community called society. The ones bigger, others smaller. Its up to you by how much you want to return to society.",
            "I think my highscool physics teacher gave me the best advice I've ever been given, and something I try to follow. If you *can* find a job you love, that's great. If you *can't*, find a job that gives you the ability to pursue the things you love.\n\nI don't like my job, but I do like that it pays me enough and gives me enough time off that I can do the things that I love to do.",
            "Easy. I like my job, my coworkers and bosses are cool, and the pay is decent.\n\nIf you're asking me this at 5AM, then the answer instead is \"Because I don't have any other goddamn choice\", \"It's too early for this Shit\", \"Stop talking to me\", or \"fuck my life\".",
            "You touched on a couple of things and I think k this is mostly a philosophical question: the answer is highly subjective since it depends on several factors, including your standards of comparison, but is in no way limited to just that domain, work. You could literally swap it for any activity and the question will stand. \n\nHave you heard the myth of [Sisyphus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus)? Long short, it's a myth about a guy who was condemned by the gods to roll a boulder up a hill only to roll it down once it got all the way up, and start all over the following day. One of the morals of the story is to be able to find meaning in the most mundane tasks.\n\nIt also depends on personal preferences, some people like work, some people like specific lines of work, and others simply don't. It's never as simple as the FB quote \"find something you love doing and you'll never have to work a day of your life\". It simply may be true or not.\n\nThen it depends on what you're comparing it to. What metrics do you use to measure something that you **enjoy**? How does your understanding compare to something that you **abhor**? When do you consider that something has crossed the threshold into being abhorrent? I think people naturally don't spend much time thinking about this but I think it helps.\n\nBut I also think the question can get expanded to other areas, such as hobbies, school, entertainment, relationships, and ultimately, life.",
            "Here's a good question to ask: What would I rather (prefer) to be doing with my time? - other then be dead - and its okay to say something that doesn't make you money, like watching TV.   \nOnce you figure out that answer, its going to guide you further into what a more enjoyable and fulfilling career, hobby, or pastime will be. If you really would prefer to just watch TV, what programs do you watch? Why do you like them? What about them are interesting?   \nDo you only watch drama? Fantasy? Do you like fantasy stories? Have you tried writing before? Etc. Etc.  \nToo often are we forcefully given this option: What do you want to do for money? and as necessary as income is, it doesn't NEED to be fulfilling either. Income is the requirement for living in a society of luxury, fulfillment is what happens when you pursue your interests and passions.",

            ">How in the hell could a man enjoy being awakened at 8:30 a.m. by an alarm clock, leap out of bed, dress, force-feed, shit, piss, brush teeth and hair, and fight traffic to get to a place where essentially you made lots of money for somebody else and were asked to be grateful for the opportunity to do so?\n\nCharles Bukowski, Factotum (1975)",

            "Sadly it\u2019s this rational that people hate their jobs and that\u2019s acceptable as the honest reason that most managers suck the life out of us and companies get away with it. I believe that if you have passions and you know where your deeper ones lie, you should work toward working in that field. I have a history of sales jobs that I\u2019ve honestly always hated sales... but it\u2019s what currently pays the bills while I return to school yet again to pivot my career yet again from tech to being a therapist. I\u2019ve avoided my whole life getting the degrees necessary, afraid of the debt as a survivalist and previous foster kid, I didn\u2019t want the debt and wasn\u2019t patient enough to press on. Now that I\u2019m in my thirties I\u2019m much better as a student and know that, officially, after working in many industries and trying to find happiness in many types of positions, that I should\u2019ve just sucked it up and pressed on to be a psychologist to help people with PTSD. Sometimes it takes guts, courage to try again, ignoring the fear of failure and even just doing a couple classes a semester in your free time from work. I\u2019ve been doing it for several years and I will continue doing it for the next career change bc I refuse to believe we have to be miserable to make money. Pretty much everyone I grew up with in my homestate stayed there. Still works at the same bar and grills, prioritized love and having babies over a passionate career. Meanwhile people like me left. I encourage whoever feels this way to yes, continue to find joy in your hobbies... and then see what hobbies have stood out to you your whole life as bringing you that burning passions, that innate joy, things you could talk to anyone about and enjoy the convo. Those are where you need to point to. That\u2019s your direction. Now thrust yourself out of your comfortable situation and do what it takes to get there. That\u2019s you dedicating yourself to self care and finding joy. That\u2019s the meaning of life. Don\u2019t give up!!! The universe hasn\u2019t given up on you.",
