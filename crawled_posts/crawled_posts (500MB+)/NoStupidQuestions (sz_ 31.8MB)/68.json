            "Fuck you. You useless piece of shit. You absolute waste of space and air. You uneducated, ignorant, idiotic dumb swine, you\u2019re an absolute embarrassment to humanity and all life as a whole. The magnitude of your failure just now is so indescribably massive that one hundred years into the future your name will be used as moniker of evil for heretics. Even if all of humanity put together their collective intelligence there is no conceivable way they could have thought up a way to fuck up on the unimaginable scale you just did. When Jesus died for our sins, he must not have seen the sacrilegious act we just witnessed you performing, because if he did he would have forsaken humanity long ago so that your birth may have never become reality. After you die, your skeleton will be displayed in a museum after being scientifically researched so that all future generations may learn not to generate your bone structure, because every tiny detail anyone may have in common with you degrades them to a useless piece of trash and a burden to society. No wonder your father questioned whether or not your were truly his son, for you'd have to not be a waste of carbon matter for anyone to love you like a family member. Your birth made it so that mankind is worse of in every way you can possibly imagine, and you have made it so that society can never really recover into a state of organization. Everything has forever fallen into a bewildering chaos, through which unrecognizable core, you can only find misfortune. I would say the apocalypse is upon us but this is merely the closest word humans have for the sheer scale of horror that is now reality. You have forever condemned everyone you love and know into an eternal state of suffering, worse than any human concept of hell. You are such an unholy being, that if you step within a one hundred foot radius of a holy place or a place that has ever been deemed important by anyone, your distorted sac religious soul will ruin whatever meaning it ever had beyond repair. You are an idiotic, shiteating, dumbass ape and no one has ever loved you. Rhodes Island would have been better off if you'd never joined us. You are a lying, backstabbing, cowardly useless piece of shit and I hate you with every single part of my being. Even this worlds finest writers and poets from throughout the ages could never hope to accurately describe the scale on which you just fucked up, and how incredibly idiotic you are. Anyone that believes in any religion out there should now realize that they have been wrong this entire time, for if divine beings were real, they would never have allowed a being such as you to stain the earth and this universe. In the future there will be horror stories made about you, with the scariest part of them being that the reader has to realize that such an indescribable monster actually exists, and that the horrific events from the movie have actually taken place in the same world that they live in right now. You are the absolute embodiment of everything that has ever been wrong on this earth, yet you manage to make it so that that is only a small part of the evil that is your being. Never in the history of mankind has there been anyone that could have predicted such an eldrich abomination, but here you are. It\u2019s hard to believe that I am seeing such an incredible failure with my own eyes, but here I am, so unfortunately I cannot deny your existence. Even if I did my very best, my vocabulary is not able to describe the sheer magnitude of the idiotic mistake that is you. Even if time travel some day will be invented, there still would not be a single soul willing to go back in time to before this moment to fix history, because having to witness such incredible horrors if they failed would have to many mental and physical drawbacks that not even the bravest soul in history would be willing to risk it. I cannot imagine the pure dread your mother must have felt when she had to carry a baby for nine months and then giving birth to such a wretched monster as you. Not a single word of the incoherent, illogical rambling you may be wanting to do to defend yourself or apologize would ever be able to make up for what you just did. The countries of the world would have wanted to make laws preventing such a terrible event like this from ever happening again, but sadly this is not possible since your horrific actions just now have shattered every form of order this world once had, making concepts such as laws irrelevant. Right from the moment I first set my eyes on you I knew you were an absolute abomination of everything that is wrong with humanity. I was hoping I would have been able to prevent your evil from being released upon this world by tagging along and keeping my eye on you, but it is clear to me now that not even the greatest efforts would have been able to prevent a terrible event in this scale from occurring. You are the worst human being, or even just being in general, that I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. Events like the infected plague apparently only happened with the goal of teaching humanity to survive such a horrible event as the one you just created, but not even mankind\u2019s greatest trials were able to even slightly prepare anyone for the insufferable evil you have just created. If you ever had them, your children would be preemptively killed to protect this universe from the possibility of anyone in your bloodline being even half as bad as you are, except you will never be able to have children, because not a single human being will ever want to come within a hundred mile radius of you and anything you have ever touched. You are a colossal disappointment not only to your parents, but to your ancestors and entire bloodline. The disgusting mistake that you have just made is so incredibly terrible that everyone who would ever be to hear about it would spontaneously feel an indescribable mixture of immense anger, fear and anxiety that emotionally and physically they would never truly be the same ever again. The sheer scale of your mistake, if ever to be materialized, would not only surpass the size of the world, but it would reach far beyond the edges of the known, and almost certainly the unknown universe. I could sit here and write paragraphs, nay, books describing your immense failure, yet even if I were to dedicate my life to describing the reality of what has just gone down here, and I would spend every moment of it until my heart stops beating working as hard and efficiently as possible, yet there is not even a snowballs chance in hell that I would be able to come close to transcribing the absolute shitshow you have just released upon the world. You are an irresponsible, idiotic, disgusting, unloved, horrible excuse for a living being who\u2019s soul contains less humanity than every ginger in history combined. The absolute disgust I feel when thinking about anything that has even a slight resemblance to anything that might have to do with you and your unholy actions is so incredibly great that when I am honest about it I think that even I do not posses a consciousness great enough to comprehend my own feelings about it. When people of Columbia fought to break free from Lungmen, countless soldiers fought and lost their lives in favor of a chance at a better future for their children, they did not give their lives to have you fuck the world up beyond repair to the degree that you are doing right now. Honestly, even when technology advances and studies on the subject become more and more accurate, I do not think humanity will ever truly be able to understand what your failure actually means for the universe. My hate for you and everything you stand for is so much deeper than the depths of Shambala that you could probably take the entire Lungmen population down there and back up around twenty million times before you would have sunk to the end of my hate, and honestly, I do not want to exaggerate, but I think that that insult was low balling it such a massive amount that all mountains in this world combined would not be able to stack up to this imprecise judgement in light of the fact that when being honest, my hate is almost certainly bottomless. There is no one in this world that has ever loved you, and especially after what you just did, no one will ever love you in the future either. There is no hope that your idiotic behavior and especially your crooked soul will ever change for the better, and in fact quite the opposite might be true. By making the mistake that you just did, you have shown me that you are so incredibly hopeless that you will only devolve into a more idiotic and wretched creature than you already are. The only possible way in which your future would be brighter than the black hole your existence currently is would exclusively be because there is absolutely no conceivable way that you would even be able to sink lower than the pathetic place your current failure has put you in.",

            "Urologist here. First off I want to clarify that most penises formed by gender affirming surgery are not always \"functional\" in the full sense of able to perform penetrative intercourse. The urethra is often transitioned to going through the clitoris, which means the new person will pee out of a sexually sensitive organ. However,  result may often not be large enough for sex. That being said the question of male birth control is a good one which I will explain.\nIts important to understand how we do female birth birth control. Women ate cyclically fertile, meaning there are times of fertility and times of infertility naturally. The basic idea is that we hijack the system and cause the infertility part to remain for longer. On the other hand, men are always fertile. To stop that we would have to break something. Breaking a particular component without breaking other components is complex, which generally requires a surgery like a vasectomy. Attempts at pill based Male birth control have either not worked or caused full on sterility in a very large amount of the test subjects.",

            "FDA requiremnets mean that you can only give a medicince if it's benefits outweigh the side effects for the patient. For woman the BC pill is accepted because it prevents what is still a very dangerous condition (pregnancy) As bio men can't get pregnant the allowed side effects for the FDA to approve are far smaller.\n\nAs for the scientific part it's because woman's bodies already have a state where they don't produce gametes. (preganancy) Thus we can simply mimic this off signal to stop ovulation.\n\nMen don't have such a signal and in fact the way the feedback mechanism in men works it will actively try to counter you using hormones to stop it meaning comparitively higher doses were needed for the same effects and thus much stronger versions of the side effects. IIRC the suicide rate was above 1% in one study.",
            "One problem is plumbing/electrical, essentially, and the other is chemistry. Very different kinds of issues to be solved",
            "Everyone keeps saying that it\u2019s the side effects that are unacceptable but there\u2019s no real context to that argument. \n\nI think what the main issue is, is that \u2018birth control\u2019 has dozens of other uses and benefits for women than just preventing birth. \n\n[Here\u2019s an article that highlights, what, 19 benefits?](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3693657/)\n\n[Here\u2019s another that talks about the shitty history of \u2018the pill\u2019 but on Page 7 takes about the non-contraceptive benefits. ](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/files/1514/3518/7100/Pill_History_FactSheet.pdf)\n\nSo I think the issue with the side effects of a male birth control are likely unnecessary for something that only has a singular purpose and a purpose that can be solved by men simply wearing condoms or using other safe-sex techniques. \n\nWhereas female hormonal birth control can help with symptoms of endometriosis, PMS, and a bunch of other things. You can\u2019t just slap a condom on to correct the lack of menstruation because of hyper athleticism or eating disorders or reduce severe cramping that can leave you bed ridden. \n\nI\u2019m sure if a male pill helped with, I don\u2019t know, male pattern baldness, erectile dysfunction, or something else it would be less impacted by side effects but, as it stands now, the options are risk liver damage, get ED, or kill your sex drive, or wear a condom and get the same effect.",

            "If we speak only of hormonal birth control (cause there is condom vasectomy as birth control for men), the primary element are that men don't have cycle with their hormones and can procreate all the time not on specific periode.\nTo have hormonal solution as birth control for men seem then complicated and with a lot of sides effects for a process that almost never causes problems.\nIn the other hand for women,  sometime periods and hormonal cycle can be help with pills to decrease pain and other problems. \nVasectomy and condom and both pretty reliable birth control solution and condom are inexpensive in developed countries so no real reason to put millions in research (they exist but not many nor well finance)",

            "Female birth control is possible because there was already biological pathways that could stop ovulation and therefore prevent pregnancy. And not even just one pathway either but a handful exploiting different hormonal signals.\n\nMales... not so lucky. If anything males are the opposite. Relatively simple hormonal cycles and a reproductive system that is essentially designed to be permanently on at all times for their entire life barring the early prepubescent stage. The only thing that can be exploited is that the system doesn't really care if it's shooting blanks the the pathway can be cut. Other methods that have been tried are similar to vasectomy but more reversable (implanted switch but has issues with leakage and having to \"clear the pipes\" after switching, and a polymer that coats the inside of the tube that shreds sperm with static forces but had issues with durability) or that attempt to mess with the viability of the sperm in other ways. Those other ways though often result in effects that aren't isolated to the reproductive system since the male hormones have system wide effects and aren't meant to be wildly altered and genetic methods targeting specific genes have the same issue of those genes being active in other vital organs.\n\nOf course this isn't to say that female hormones also dont cause issues when they are messed with due to birth control or that there are other issues with female birth control. It helps that there are multiple options available though it doesn't always mean that everything will work. But for men they are struggling to find even a single solution that won't have drastic side effects or high failure rates for large portions of users.",

            "Females have an innate on/off switch that we exploit with pharmaceuticals. The body knows that releasing more eggs and shedding the endometrium during a pregnancy wouldn\u2019t work, so we stimulate hormone levels reflective of pregnancy to prevent ovulation, implantation, etc. \n\nMales don\u2019t have a chemical cycle to exploit, so the only options are physical barriers. (I\u2019ll argue now that we definitely have male birth control, but they\u2019re all physical, rather than chemical like the popular daily women\u2019s pill). Pretty much all male options are barriers at different levels of the reproductive pathway. Condoms stop the flow of sperm external to the male and vasectomies stop the flow internally.\n\nI suppose you could count spermicidal lubricants as a chemical barrier to male gametes. The problem with reliability there, though, stems from the sexual act generating a variable amount of fluids by both partners.

Or convince them that the world is round.",
            "The idea that some conspiracy theories are right is essentially a kind of \"survivorship bias\"; we're only looking at the ones that turned out to be right, rather than conspiracies as a whole. If there's 100 conspiracy theories out there and 10 of them turn out to be right, that's a 90% false positivity rate, yet we'll all focus on those 10 times they were right.\n\nIt's the same kind of psychological effect behind \"The Simpsons predicted...\". It's looking at things retroactively. The Simpsons isn't making predictions. It's a show that plays close to society and pop culture. Given the hundreds of episodes and the infinite amount of time for any \"prediction\" to come true, it's only a matter of time until something happens that resembles something in one of the hundreds of episodes made over decades, and we jump on it like a prophecy rather than a coincidence we're only noticing because we have the confirmation bias to look for it.",

            "There's a difference if having healthy skepticism and saying 'this might be possible, I could be wrong, it needs to be supported by evidence'. What scares me is how unscientific and incapable of exerting some nuance and hesitation in their opinions people can be. What scares me is people incapable of admitting that they were wrong, and not attuning their opinions to actual evidence. Like, covid, when we didn't know anything about it, it made sense to be skeptical of it's scale. But hundreds of thousands of people die, world economies crippled, and you think every country is somehow working together and wants this? It's delusion at it's finest.\n\nConspiracies can be true, but believing in something after it's disproved time and time again, or doesn't actually have evidence to back the claim, is unscientific and frankly, disappointing. I can see the comforting and attractive nature of conspiracies, but it seems like our educational system really let a lot of us down.",
            "There's a limitless number of possible conspiracy theories. NASA is completely staffed by genetically-modified chipmunks disguised as humans. Monsanto is hiding seeds in their weedkiller agents to grow an army of plant zombies.\n\nThe difference between these ones I just made up and the most popular ones (like ones involving the moon landing or 9/11) is that the popular ones have semi-ambiguous questions that people of average intelligence or knowledge may have trouble answering.\n\nFor example, the general public may not have an answer to the question of why the flag on the moon is portrayed as fluttering on a surface with no air. People may write off, without evidence, that it must be due to a breeze from Earth. People who are capable of looking up additional information can find, from reputable sources (supported by corroborating sources), that [the flag's ripple was the result of an error in the telescopic rod's setup](https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=97589&page=1).",

Disinformation is also a thing, it was somewhat of a natural process for 'conspiracy theorist' to be a slur: call someone a conspiracy theorist and others automatically/subconsciously discount them as crazy or odd. Intelligence agencies capitalized on this, and welcome the weird shit about moon hoaxes and flat earth, it helps to bury the more serious real stuff like torture, testing syphilis on poor people, undermining governments etc. Another thing is it could be considered a bad thing if every government was 100% transparent, it would be much easier to have hostile takeovers if your enemies knew 100% about you.",

            "There's nothing intrinsically wrong with conspiracy theories. Conspiracies happen and are possible.\n\nProblem is conspiracy theories tend to be garbage. They aren't grounded in any evidence.

Take a nap.",
            "The issue is the consistent lack of evidence. Most conspiracy theories are based on outright made-up nonsense (like that 5G will give you cancer or that Bill Gates is trying to track people with vaccines). \n\nAnd even if they're more plausible, they're asserted without any evidence. The conspiracy is never \"This guy conspired with this guy\" it's always \"The government\" or \"Rich people\" because the conspiracy theorist doesn't have any idea who they're even accusing.  \n\nConspiracies do happen, but they're difficult to pull off so they're relatively rare. As the old saying goes, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.  It's not enough for something to just be *possible.*",
            "I largely agree with you, but I would also say, exactly *because* we know so much, it hardly makes sense to make conspiracy theories. This is a point by Noam Chomsky: why even begin with conspiracy theories, when *we know* for sure\u2014when in fact it is wide out in in the open and not even attempted covered up\u2014that the US government is responsible for some of recent history's most atrocious war crimes? Even some of the most far-out conspiracies don't hold the US government responsible for things that are worse than initiating the Vietnam War on illegal grounds, which we know for a fact they did. So while some conspiracy theories may be true, and most are probably less so, I think a fair question to ask is \"why bother?\"",

You'd have to have omniscient power to observe every inch of the planet simultaneously to say there are no unicorns anywhere on the planet. But if you claim unicorns exist you'd only have to show one to the skeptics to prove they exist. Likewise, if someone says the earth is flat the burden of proof is on them. It isn't enough for them to cast a little bit of doubt on every bit of evidence indicating that the world is round. They have to come up with indisputable proof that the earth is flat. \n\n\nThe primary reason people don't believe conspiracy theorists isn't because they are making extraordinary claims. It's because they typically employ an unscientific methodology in reaching their conclusions. Often times their confirmation bias is ridiculously skewed. They show an almost comical willingness to accept anything that would validate their beliefs and an unreasonable scepticism of any evidence that plainly disproves their theories no matter how valid and conclusive it is.",
            "In hindsight it feels certainly like we have good documentation of government operations but, in reality, we have less than you think.  The birthplace of modern conspiracy starts around the assassination of JFK.  At the time, information was intentionally muddied, and to top it off there were already a large set of boundaries in the way of this information.  Not only did multiple government officials/agencies have the motivation present to easily have blame cast upon them, but Lee Harvey Oswald never had his day in court.  He was murdered just days after the event.  No matter who you think is really responsible, the result of this ended up in thousands of books being written with different sources and biases, continuing to bog down the legitimate information we had about the assassination. \n\nTrust in our government to tell us the truth dwindled and continued to do so drastically over time.  It became commonplace to question our government, but this skepticism ended up becoming misguided because of who was controlling the narrative.  The far right, which thrives on conspiracy, was able to capitalize on every event the government butchered.  Ruby ridge, Waco, OKC bombing.  \n\nThe biggest misguidance in these situations, which you\u2019ll hear often, is \u2018government cover-up\u2019.  When you hear that, you think \u2018government commits malicious acts and falsifies evidence to confuse the people\u2019.  In reality, government cover up is an accurate term with inaccurate application.  The biggest crimes our government committed in these instances, that which they tried to cover up, was not malicious intent, but rather an immense incompetence in systems that failed to resolve situations.  \n\nOf course, there are times where it is malicious.  There are legitimate conspiracy theories that take only factual information and, instead of saying \u2018we know for sure this is the problem\u2019 it says \u2018this is likely the problem, it\u2019s where all the information points, but it\u2019s not enough to prove it.  Stay skeptical but don\u2019t be fucking stupid\u2019.\n\nWhen someone says \u2018Do your research\u2019, they aren\u2019t just wrong and I think we all know that.  They\u2019re wrong because he context is usually about something that research tends to debunk, not support.  There are good people doing good research on far more legitimate conspiracies, and their reputation is ruined by jackasses who turn everything into \u2018the globalist agenda\u2019 or whatever.  \n\nTLDR:  Most of the time, our government is trying to cover up just how bad it is at doing it\u2019s job.  This inherently sows distrust which allows (primarily) far right / anti-science groups to spread misinformation under a trustworthy guise.  Because we cannot trust information, most of us naturally turn to confirmation bias.",

            "Because, where we actually have evidence of governments doing shady shit, we actually have evidence.\n\nConspiracy theorists tend to fly in the face of evidence, compelling, uncompelling, anecdotal, scientific, or whatever evidence you care to name, that doesn't fit with their narrative. It is surprising that these people exist, because we expect other people to be inherently rational.\n\nIt is not logical to look at the world around you and assume that none of it is actually as it appears, to look at information you're presented and immediately doubt or believe the opposite of its contents.\n\nThere are a lot of parallels between conspiracy theory and religious fundamentalism and alternative medicine theories.\n\nTake Chi/Qi, for example. Qi theory was a framework for understanding how the human body worked, in a time when people weren't allowed to perform dissections. The Chinese theorised that we had three  \"burners\" located in the solar plexus, heart, and head, which produced a kind of \"steam\" (which you can see leave the body in cold weather), and this \"steam\" travelled through meridians in your body to make you move. They built an entire system of medicine around this. When they were finally allowed to perform dissections, or were confronted with proof that, actually, there are no Chi burners or meridians, rather than abandon the theory, they changed their stance to say that it was a *metaphysical* system. Nowadays, you talk to 10 different proponents of different elements of Chi theory (for medicine, for treatment, for martial arts), and you will get 10 different versions of how Chi works. Some will say it's bioelectricity, some will say it's energy, some will say it's heat. Some will say they smell it, some will say they taste it, some say they sense vibrations. \n\nI once watched two healing crystal proponents sit and discuss the purposes of different gemstones, and the effects that they had, and they were both in total agreement that different crystals have different purposes. Then one of them turned around and said that they do a lot of work with \"crystal arrays\", and they generally find that, unlike what a lot of crystal people believe, you can use any crystal for any purpose, and that if you turn a single crystal so that the lines are slightly different, that crystal will have the opposite effect to what you intend. Rather than rail against the blatant contradiction to the crystal theory \"mainstream\", or question the disparity, the first proponent was in awe at how high a level in crystal-ing the \"crystals for any purpose\" person was. Because these things are not about seeking facts, they are about suspending disbelief.\n\nSame for conspiracy theorists. We have ample evidence that the holocaust happened - they invent a convoluted narrative \"disproving\" it. We have ample evidence we landed on the moon. They question the footage, and pay no heed to the answers to their questions. We have ample evidence that the world is not flat. They claim that Australia doesn't exist, and anyone who's been there was deceived by government actors. There was a school shooting, and someone was there. They claim that the person is lying.\n\nConspiracy theorists claim that the Democrats were running a pedophile ring out of the basement of pizza restaurant. The pizzeria has no basement. The conspiracy theorists still make the claim, despite this easily provable fact.\n\nWe are surprised that there are so many conspiracy theorists, because there shouldn't be *any*.

I knew how much my grandmother liked jewelry, so I got them as a Christmas present for her.\n\nI gave them to her, she seemed happy, and I didn't think anything more of it until a couple of years later at her funeral. We were at the viewing, and I noticed she was wearing the earrings I had gotten her.

The interaction between people takes precedence, and ideas like grammar and formal 'correctness' take a back seat. Non-natives, on the other hand, need rules to fall back on. They need to be aware of the difference between \"than\" and \"then\" in order to make sense of the means of communication they are trying to use.\n\nSo it's not really that native speakers find it \"hard\" to recognize the difference; it's more that a lot of us just don't care about the difference and don't really have to.

So, when it gets sounded out it's written the same despite the word actually meaning a different thing and being spelled differently. It gets used interchangeably. \n\nWhen I have tried learning other languages I focus on proper pronunciation, especially minor nuances like in the English then/than.

It often inserts the wrong word, so if a person sees this on their phone, it reinforces the error, or at least exacerbate the uncertainty. The harder it is to see a pattern, the harder it is to cement in your mind which is which. This is why it's good to get kids to read a lot as they're growing up.

            "Be careful because there are a lot of privacy issues with TikTok. Like, even more than most social media stuff. But as the top comment and it\u2019s top reply already said, look for this stuff on YouTube and you\u2019ll see the names of some of the TikTok dancers and can follow them on there, too.\n\nAlso, may want to consider talking to her briefly about how most of these are just fads and go away pretty quickly. Didn\u2019t flash mobs used to be a thing briefly like a decade ago? And I\u2019m pretty sure there was something else before Fortnite\u2019s \u201cFlossing.\u201d I also remember \u201cThe Carlton\u201d back when Fresh Prince was popular.\n\nIf her and her friends like the dance stuff, you may want to suggest they try learning choreography to other dances, too. Like the old Watch Me Whip, Watch Me NaeNae or whatever, and Crank That by Soulja Boy. (Explicit song, just giving some examples I\u2019m slightly more familiar with)\n\nThey could also probably try learning choreography from some movies at some point, like Step Up. If they bring in a new dance to perform at a school talent show or something, they may start a new fad briefly or something, instead of just being part of the current one. Even if they don\u2019t manage that, I don\u2019t think it would be bad to encourage them to explore more than just TikTok dances. They can do that, too, of course. \n\nAnd props for trying to do what you can to be a cool dad, and asking for help when you need it. Both are very respectable.\n\n(Wow, this is probably the most serious post I\u2019ve made all year. Not even a hint of a joke yet. Maybe I\u2019m dying D; oh no!)",
