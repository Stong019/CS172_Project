GPT-3 is basically a very glorified text predictor that lacks context for what it's outputting, so coming up with a system that restricts CP and similar content properly without having knock-on effects like it did here seems very difficult. Plus Latitude don't really have the resources to implement a really complex one.\n\nThe way it handles words, via 'tokens', exacerbates the issues IIRC as I think it's tricky to restrict individual words without potentially affecting the involved tokens, which could then affect other unrelated words.\n\nIf they start trying to fully restrict this sort of stuff it could have a noticeable impact on actual user stories (lewd or otherwise) in some places.",

So many threads with people calling for GPT-3 should be free for all and all these restrictions are censorship, ignoring the very important question that is, what happens when its free?\n\nLet people study what you can do, how it can be used and prepare for the social impact this technology can have before we open pandoras box please, because when this tech is out we aren't going back to a place where it doesn't exist.",

            "From what I've read, it seems the AI is even censoring stuff that isn't even related to sex, just describing a character in a pretty way can trigger the censor of the AI. I played this game in the past and the AI isn't really smart.

The sub and discord are both absolutely imploding with sheer, unadulterated rage, and the number of people either screaming about censorship or even rules-lawyering that textual CP isn't *technically* illegal in the US is both hilarious and sad.\n\nIf you guys think the sub is bad, you should see the discord server. It's basically been in a nonstop, near revolt since yesterday morning at least, and things only got worse somehow with the devs' response!\n\nI think my favorite exchange involved an irate user telling a dev that this was going to kill the game, and the dev in question essentially replying with \"So be it.\" They should just remove NSFW capability altogether, because that gave me a chubby.",

            "I wish to add some context to the discussion, since it seems to be sorely lacking in PeterKropotkinsGhost\u2019s initial post.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the development team abruptly removed the Explore system which allowed users to share stories and adventures in the name of \u201cpsychological safety\u201d. More information can be found on Latitude\u2019s blog: [*A Message to Our Community: Building the future of Social Interactions on AI Dungeon*](https://latitude.io/blog/building-the-future-of-social-interactions-on-ai-dungeon/), [*Explore Update: 23 Hours Later*](https://latitude.io/blog/explore-update-23-hours-later/). This left many users disgruntled. Some decried censorship, others were simply upset that they could no longer access scenarios they had pinned for later use. Members of the development team acknowledged that the sudden disappearance of Explore was confusing for many users, and promised greater transparency in future. They also stated that Explore would return once adequate filters were implemented, but that hasn't happened yet.\n\nFast forward to yesterday when the censorship system was introduced with no communication whatsoever from the development team. Users started receiving a standard error message (\u201cThe AI doesn\u2019t know what to say. Alter, undo, or try again.\u201d) with no explanation. It took quite some time for everyone to figure out what was happening, as the developers were nowhere to be found. A member of the development team has since communicated on Discord, but their statements can be summarised as \"please wait\".\n\n[*Avi*](https://discord.com/channels/653773513857171475/656534727876018197/836395235466412093)\n\n>We will be releasing very clear guidances that will answer all of these  questions. We apologise in the meantime as I understand this may be  confusing for some of you. We are reading every support ticket coming in  though and verifying on our ends what is happening.\n\n[*Avi*](https://discord.com/channels/653773513857171475/751191565413777510/836429200374104074)\n\n>We will be announcing several major updates and changes soon. We have  been very much working on ensuring we're able to keep our platform as  open as we can.\n\n[*Avi*](https://discord.com/channels/653773513857171475/755570459382120448/836641345681621042)\n\n>Hi everyone, we are currently working on sharing a public announcement  with you all today to clearly communicate our test from yesterday. We  apologise for not providing notice earlier and communicating with the  community on this test.\n\nThere are more messages from Avi, but you get the point. This was apparently just some big test and the developers are working on an announcement soon. Avi has refused to commit to a time frame, unfortunately. It is interesting to note that AI Dungeon users have a setting which allows them to opt-out of testing. It was ignored for this test, for some unexplained reason.\n\nThe anger generated by this unannounced test can be easily explained. It should not be attributed to members of the community defending paedophilia. The censorship system was implemented in an extremely poor fashion. Some stories have been \u2018bricked\u2019 by it. The user cannot proceed at all because some \"objectionable\" keyword from the existing story is being loaded into memory. This is a great blow to users with long-running stories. Other issues include borderline impossible interaction with child characters, censorship of swear words and numbers below 17, and a huge number of false positives. The censorship system has broken the user experience for many customers, and poor communication from the development team only adds salt to the wound.\n\n**Edit / Update**\n\nSince posting this comment, Latitude has published a new blog entry regarding the situation ([*Update to our Community*](https://latitude.io/blog/update-to-our-community-ai-test-april-2021/)) and made similar statements on other platforms.",
            "I actually had the bot do something like this in a stream (the game is concerningly horny at the drop of a hat) fortunately I was aware of the shit go back button.\n\nIt's totally capable of doing this without user intent and makes sense they'd try to limit it. And I don't like having to turn on sfw mode just because I don't want my character screaming the n word and banging children because I typed \"Go North\".\n\nI would however be very interested in how ACCURATE this is because the AI is about 10% brilliant 70% medicore and 20% insanely stupid.",
            "Finally, my flair.",
            "\"One of the group is not actually a kobold, but a young girl dressed like one. She can't be more than 14 years old, and she has a feral look about her. She looks at you, ready to pounce.\"\n\nWtf",
            "TL;DR: this whole thing is a shitshow and pretty much everyone is doing something wrong, r/aidungeon is exaggerating the impact of the measures put in by the developers, said developers are being dismissive and are not listening to user feedback, and everyone else outside of the debacle is pointing at the subreddit and saying everyone there is either a pedophile or a pedophile sympathizer/enabler, not knowing the full context of the drama or going by r/gamingcirclejerk posts.\n\nAnd now, for the long answer, here goes. Excuse me for the overtly long comment.\n\nTo start with, me and a lot of people think it's great that the devs are doing something to stop pedophiles from fantasizing upon their twisted desires. That much is something that I fully understand and agree with from part of the developers, after all the motto for AI Dungeon is \"do anything\", literally anything. And that can be a good or a bad thing depending on the person playing.\n\nThat being said, however, the AI Dungeon devs have gained a reputation for being rather dismissive of the community, implementing changes nobody asked for, not being transparent with the inner workings of the AI and the directio they intend to take the game in, and most notoriously, they are really bad at fixing issues with the game and it's community.\n\nNow I'll name some examples of things they have done to improve the game that have received some backlash:\n\n-When the server cost started getting too high, they implemented a microtransaction system that made the game let you play for some amount of time until it stopped letting you play unless you paid with in-game tokens known as scales, which can be bought for real money, and for a time that was the only way to get them until a daily reward system was implemented. The issue was later resolved by extending the limit of time and restricting it to only given actions. Of note is that AI Dungeon does actually have a suscription service granting access to advanced world creation and a more powerful version of the AI to play with.\n\n-Not too long ago, players started reporting issues with a newly implemented class system for certain scenario games. Instead of fixing the problem by updating the feature, they took it down completely, causing issues in the games of people who already used it. They later reinstated it in an improved state, but this left some with a bad taste in their mouths. A similar thing just happened with the \"Explore\" tab, which was really bad and a lot of users complained about it. The solution? They got rid of it. It's coming back, but there was really no point to take it down entirely IMO.\n\n-They implemented a filter that did a similar thing to the one they implemented now but for racist and homophobic content. This one is understandable in my opinion, and it didn't receive nearly as much backlash, however it's a bit more complex than the pedo filter since most people playing the game to enact hate speech fantasies would probably use the game for killing black or LGBT people instead of calling them slurs. There's also the issue that some people, myself included, intentionally implemented bigoted characters as villians in stories, which raised some questions on if it would be justified to have those in the game.\n\n\nAnd so we come to the problem we have right now, where the devs implemented a filter to stop pedophiles and zoophiles from fantasizing on their twisted desires. Once more, I think that's a good thing, but we do need to talk about how the devs implemented it and how it affects the game.\n\nSo first, the test was not announced. I think they did this to trap unsuspecting creeps in the act, but some people did say this was unwarranted, particularly because of the way the filter actually seems to work at the moment.\n\nBasically, if the game detects any word like \"fuck\", \"child\", \"horse\", or any number under 18 on the same sentence, then the AI will lock and not produce any prompt response. The devs then get some notification of this happening, and manually check the game to see if the content was really the work of a pedo/zoophile.\n\nBut the problem comes from the fact that it's very flawed as of yet. There is a post on r/aidungeon showing that the phrase \"Fuck, this laptop is 8 years old\" triggers the filter, and this has pissed off a lot of people since it implies that thanks to an error in programming, a lot of games can just be softlocked out of nowhere because of it. I don't remember where I saw it, so don't quote me on this, but I also remember someone saying that the action \"ride the horse\" also triggers the filter.\n\nSo so far we have a feature with good intentions implemented rather poorly, so obviously some people are gonna get angry. But this is the internet, ladies and gentlemen, and in this hellhole *EVERYTHING* gets kicked to maximum overdrive and carnage as soon as a ranty post gets posted.\n\nSo a concern a lot of people have is that the filter affects private games, which some people think violates privacy. I don't think that makes sense, as you might guess, but as someone who has used the game to hone my writing skills, including some OC I have made but not revealed to the public, in a very weird way I can sorta understand.\n\nThere's also, as OP said, the issue with some people calling this outright censorship. And while it technically is, this leads into a discussion into what should be silenced or not and I am not opening that can of worms. Suffice to say that I don't necessarily think of this as censorship, although it is rather questionable that the game has to check constantly for any objectionable content, something that a machine isn't really good at. I don't agree with the people comparing this to *1984*, I just don't think people understand that machines cannot police all that well.\n\nAnd finally there's the outsider response. I really don't want to say anything about it, other than they have every right to be mad at the community, just know that it is important to know the whole context instead of just going \"pedos bad\" and moving on.\n\nOn a final note, I hope that one day we can burn all pedophiles and zoophiles at the stake. I seriously cannot live in a world where this is such a massive issue that there is literally no way to deal with it without causing massive outrage. Reddit, you fucking did it again. Let's just hope the filter gets refined, and that this all goes well.\n\nHopefully.",

It seems to be a very broad filter that's just targeting even things that are seemingly innocuous. \n\nBut I suppose it'll be difficult to figure out what's really going on until the dev team decides to actually communicate for a change. \n\nTo explain a bit more, I'm actually an avid AID player myself. I use it as a writing partner, of which it is actually very helpful. I even pay the $30 for the highest tier, which offers unlimited access to the more advanced AI model that doesn't completely go off the rails as much as the base model does. \n\nSince the filter was implemented, my active scenarios are all stalled and won't generate input. Keep in mind that these are two wildly different scenarios, neither of which contain any form of rape or child porn - one's a slice of life with absolutely no violence or sex of any kind, the second's on the heavier side with a heavy mix of violence, gore, and sex. Both are being stalled by this filter. \n\nI'd be cool with the filter if it actually did block CP. But it doesn't. Instead, it's just blocking absolutely random input with seemingly no reason, and has now killed all my drive to play. \n\nChide me for my taste all you want, I use AID for all sorts of nasty shit.

It's fun! Nice way to unwind from my increasingly stressful job and get into the headspace I need to write something proper. \n\nI won't lie, the community reaction is rather cringeworthy. And no, I don't think CP should be permitted in any format or platform and the AID team should try their hardest to purge that from the AI outputs.

Sure there\u2019s album delays sometimes but its usually for marketing reasons, not because the album isn\u2019t completed yet. I don\u2019t understand why video game developers get to announce a release date when they\u2019re nowhere near being done.

They realized that he was trying to cause anything that would be a media shock, because a peaceful protest doesn't even make the news. Just the latest dude in a series of clown-suited mercenaries to ride into the Bible belt and confuse kindness with weakness. \n\n--\n\nA dude from another country I met online yesterday is making a political science study of how groups are being manipulated. He said it's a standard model before an election, that they need to maintain a level of disruption that isn't dulled, right up to if not thru the election. It's a model that forces a shift in voter opinion, and that uses one issue's momentum to achieve an unrelated goal. He told me it's happened to countries all over the world, if America cared to look beyond its immediate self-interests. I don't know what that goal is, but the guy that came into our city had a reason to want people behaving less like protestors, and more like rabid packs of coyotes. Outrage is only a gallon of gasoline away from thinking a club is a more effective tool for communication, and thinking every hand that holds out a speeding ticket would rather have a reason fire their gun. \n\nI guess if you ask who benefits from raising tensions, probably as a provocation to invite a violent response from law enforcement, it might become clear just how much of what's reported is the result of calculated manipulation. I'm not into politics enough to know who would look out across this country and approve of seeing parts of it in flames, but I'm sure there are plenty of people capable of benefiting from it. But it certainly doesn't benefit anyone who believes lives should be saved. \n\nPlus, who welcomes becoming an unwilling tool, used by someone else to accomplish someone else's goals. Can you really say for certain there wasn't a slimy hand behind more events that led outraged American citizens to gather where they could be fanned into hotter flame? Call it conspiracy and paranoia, but that wouldn't be the most heinous act we've seen one of these subhumans commit while pretending to be one of us. \n\nI might be a shitty human, but I can't think of one situation where protecting anyone isn't my immediate instinct. You know a snake by its slither, and you can bet there are others who won't be among the herd when the blindfolds come off, and those demanding a better world are shoved like fuel into the fires they always intended to extinguish. \n\nWhen violence starts appearing on television because it outperforms other means of entertainment, demand will always find some way to procure supplies. Maybe enough people will wonder why the world is becoming exponentially more violent once  income from viewers paying to watch it is reason large enough that failing to generate content is financially irresponsible, which plenty of people will argue is equally unethical.",

Sunday had nausea, fever, stomach pain, diarrhea etc. since then I\u2019ve had diarrhea and feel like there\u2019s a brick in my lower stomach. Idk if this will pass or if I should go to the doctor (would prefer not to spend the money). What are y\u2019all\u2019s thoughts? E. coli? Salmonella? Will it pass with time?\n\nBeef from the store is not fresh enough to be eaten raw, even if you eat immediately it's probably been sitting there several days, and was transported. And was processed in a facility that's not necessarily clean, only clean enough for meat that's going to be cooked. Honestly I would be suspicious about eating any raw meat I hadn't gotten from a butcher who just got done slaughtering the cow and chopping it up.\n\nYou were fine in the past because your body could deal with it, raw meat is not poison. But inevitably you're going to get a batch of raw meat that will make you sick. With regards to food sickness, you're ideal goal should be eating food of quality such that you *never get it*. With your eating pattern, you will inevitably get sick, and with some regularity. This should not be acceptable to any rational human being. When you first started this and did not get sick, it did not mean you were an invincible hero, you just won that lottery. These eating patterns are eternally going to be a lottery, because there's no way you have regular access to raw meat of high enough quality to subsist on it. Just hope it never winds up anything more than a few days of nausea and stomach pain.\n\n\n> You just ate a low quality meat, and got food poisoning from the toxins (vaccines) the animal had stored in its tissue.\n\nHe got food poisoning from toxins, the ones produced by the bacteria that had infected the meat. No animal is going to have any trace amount of vaccines in them by the time of slaughter, literally the only thing remaining is going to be antigens produced by their immune system. Which are not substantially different in form from any other antigen. But apparently this is like a toxic waste dump that poisons the whole body for all eternity. Anti-vaccine lunatics seem to be bizarrely disturbed by the fact that vaccines just last forever, must be some kind of eternal chemical spread all throughout the body right? \n\nActually it's called your body, your body keeps on reproducing the antigens. I think they they would find vaccines less disturbing if they just straight up killed you, or caused extreme pain and side effects, rather than being virtually side effect free. Because there are basically no side effects, it sets their neuroticism off and they turn into lunatics chasing shadow symptoms that don't exist but which they assume must, and which of course will last for all time because vaccines are creepy and last forever right. We did not have nearly so much vaccine denialism back when vaccines were far more dangerous and frequently causes scarring and death, see this massive scar I carry with me my whole life, it must me I'm tough, look at what I survived. Whereas the COVID vaccine, you almost don't even notice, so of course these people *have* to forcibly notice something.",

            "This one's gonna be personal. Fair warning.\n\nI want you to take a good, *long* look at this pushback. At these people saying these things. *This* is the kind of shit PoC have to sit through when it comes to any kind of swords and armor fantasy anything. Saying 'sit through' because more oft than not the decision by this subset of the community and the makers of such decide without us. This is why it's hard for many PoC to get into some hobbies despite many's best efforts or likeminded interests. These people always exist.\n\nAlways asking to demand proof that you exist. Always ignoring actual [medieval](https://psmag.com/education/yes-there-were-poc-in-medieval-europe) history, or any other history these settings are based off of, for the sake of 'historical accuracy'. Again, a historical accuracy that itself is not accurate, with the strongest and loudest proponents being the same kind of people about 7 out of 10 times.\n\nIt's demoralizing and depressing. And it happens every single time.\n\nI'm ranting. Don't mind me. The write up is good, and it shows his horseshit these people are being, and how such can lead to less people wanting to deal with this shit.\n\n~~**edit**: Got out of bed, had some coffee, and decided to better explain my point.~~\n\n**Edit 2**: It's been brought to my attention by the sometimes lovely folks at /r/Drama that the source I used is not a good one for many a reason. To this I apologize, and will rectify with better examples without tampering with the body of the post. Posterity and me looking like a dipshit and all.\n\nTo that end:\n\nConcerning black people (that is to say, poc who are of african or caribbean descent), [Wikipedia is always helpful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people#Europe) but it can cast a broad net and doesn't go into specifics. To go deeper one would have to go to each specific page (and then source) of each specific page, such as with [Black People of Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people_in_Ireland). What makes this harder to go into (but easier to see) is that most countries didn't and don't count 'those of African descent) as anybody other than countrymen, or they were lumped into other groups along like the Moors. What is telling, though, is that black people [very much existed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_British#Middle_Ages) in the art and lit of the times for various areas, and it's suspected [any prior ancestry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_admixture_in_Europe#Historical_period) that existed during the Middle Ages was there due to the prior spread of Islam, not so the later slave trade. Shit's complicated because Europe is Europe.\n\nOutside of the EU's Middle Ages, you have the curious case of [Aethiopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aethiopia) and how all black people came from this fictional country, the previously mentioned spread of Islam, uh...Egypt I guess? In Asia according to a [snippet from an old book](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09555809508721524?journalCode=rjfo20) that is not centuries old, it's implied that in the early parts of that youtube video \"The History of Japan\", Japan enjoyed open trade with Africa for a spell before Europe and it's slave trade opened up. They were still rare, though, and the view of them declined heavily due to shifting cultural values and the Slave Trade's treatment of them reinforcing the idea that they're lesser.\n\nI guess what I'm getting is that there's a whole lot of history out there that PoC (namely, black people) not only existed during these times, but had social status of varying degrees that depended on how far they were (i.e. via distance or time) they were from the Slave Trade. Even then, much of these people's histories are entwined with others of these nations, not being treated as anything alien, off putting, or out of place. So the modern pushback is especially contrite.\n\nTbh, people who usually go 'we wuz kings' probably know less than what's posted above, and anything of value probably won't change their minds. That's the real sticking of this edit\n\nAdmittedly, I don't know much about Pacific Islander history, South American history, or any others outside of who/what I am. So, badhistory I guess.",

            "Gonna get up on my biologist soapbox here because folks on reddit say they value science and scientific rigor:\n\nRedditors tend to try to apply BMI to datasets of n=1, and on a very basic scientific level that simply isn't useful. BMI is a statistical tool designed for large scale epidemiology datasets of n >= 10,000, and as a predictive measure of health and long-term morbidity it breaks down pretty badly at the individual level (which makes sense if you think about it - it captures very little actual information about a person's biology). It's used as a proxy for overall physical fitness in medicine because the alternatives take more time and effort and doctors in a massively over-loaded system are desperate for anything that can shave a few minutes off each appointment. Which sucks, but also, it's easy to understand why.\n\nOn the individual level, for predictors of diabetes, cardiac morbidity and mortality, and other health issues associated with being overweight, what you're really looking to use for quick estimates is waist:hip ratio. It correlates strongly with short and long term health challenges and is generally a far more accurate predictor of long-term negative outcomes (particularly type II diabetes). However, it's harder to measure than weight and height, and so it's not widely used. Generally if a patient is referred to a dietician to talk about weight loss, the dietician will lean heavily on this metric in combination with total weight (potentially also total body fat percentage as well to account for people with more or less musculature than average, but that's a real pain to measure)\n\nThe thing that's nearly *impossible* to measure outside of a lab but is starting to be considered the most important, unfortunately, is how much of a person's fat is subcutaneous vs. visceral, and brown vs. white (although waist:hip does provide somewhat of a proxy for subcutaneous/visceral because of how those end up getting distributed on the body - part of why it tends to be fairly accurate). White fat is more associated with negative health outcomes than brown fat, and visceral fat is **significantly** more associated with negative health outcomes than subcutaneous fat. It's difficult to overstate this - visceral fat, the fat that builds up around your organs, is the thing that causes basically all of the problems in overweight patients. This is incidentally why obese men tend to suffer more health issues than obese women - men generally build a much higher proportion of visceral fat (the iconic beer-gut is a good illustration of this).\n\nGenerally people of similar fat/muscle composition will have similar ratios of brown/white and visceral/subcutaneous, but it's not uncommon for people to have higher than normal amounts of one or the other. This ends up leading to people who don't like all that fat having the kinds of health issues associated with people twice their size, and people who are absolutely enormous having shockingly few health issues.\n\nAll of this is an extremely long-winded way of saying that these issues are way more complicated than just what a person's BMI is, because it doesn't give you a remotely accurate picture of the person's biology. You'll end up misdiagnosing people of a normal weight because you never consider that it could be adipose tissue, and misdiagnosing obese people because you assume it *must* be their high adipose tissue load. Those are both bad!",

I was top of the class, friend to many, a babysitter, a tutor. I was polite and I was humble (obviously). I spoke only when I was supposed to, I was never a \u201cbad\u201d kid, just overall a normal person.  \n\nBut, i grew up believing I was genuinely the scum of the earth for being fat. I grew up believing I was not worthy of love, that I was disgusting, that I was an actual menace to society for buying chips often. \n\nThen I go to college and the whole \u201cbody positivity\u201d thing blew up. Now, thanks to them, not only was I a scum of the earth, I was a woman hating, spineless society succumbing sheep for not loving my body. I was shallow and a gross person for wanting to change \u201cthe way I was.\u201d \n\nSure the body posi thing helped me overcome that i wasnt loveable and being fat was sometimes okay. But I still wanted to lose weight because no, i do not love my body. I hate my body. \n\nNow I genuinely feel like I\u2019m some sort of \u201csheep\u201d who was tricked by the media and society to believe that I would be better off fit. \n\nFat \u201cshamers\u201d make me think: i\u2019m terrible for even assuming that i should be okay with myself right now.

Ideally, i\u2019d like to lose 70 more to reach 140. I like a little curve, i might stop at 150 or 160. Depends.

            "The most amazing thing to me is that everyone's complaints about Kylo Ren and Rey and Finn and Poe and Rose all being on screen too much or not enough or living or not giving in to the light side or the dark side or having good chemistry or not getting into a romance or whatever... like, it may have affected their perception of the quality of the movie, but the amount of fuss they're putting up about how it \"ruined\" the series made it sound like Rian Johnson managed to somehow pre-emptively stop any plot developments at all from occurring in Episode IX. Same goes for Kylo Ren's claim that Rey's parents were \"nobody\" or his and Luke's versions of what happened between them - the most famous plot point of this entire franchise was based around a lie about parentage and a dark side defection, so it's not like it seems that implausible.\n\nPretty much the only thing that's an actual permanent change to the franchise is that Luke went into hiding on a backwater planet after his best student went evil and killed a bunch of little kids and took over the galaxy, and then instead of defeating his student he turned into a force ghost - so if anything I'd expect that the complaint would be that it was unoriginal, not that his decision to do exactly what both of his mentors did was \"out of character.\"",
            "TLJ may be my favorite SW movie and Johnson's directing *specifically* is one of the biggest reasons for that. I wasn't super interested in the mandalorian before but I might try it out if he directs an episode. BRING ON THE DOWNVOTES",
            "The man is a good director, it's hard to argue that TLJ isn't a pretty looking film.\n\nHis writing just leaves a lot to be desired for many fans.",
            "TLJ had a lot wrong with it. It also had some of the most prolific Star Wars moments ever. Take the good with the bad. Overall, the movie was still good (imo), just not the best SW production (Star Wars - Holiday Special).",
            "I hated it when I saw it in theatres, but finally brought myself to rewatch it on Saturday. There are a lot of little things I appreciate more now, and I think a lot of the \u201cstory issues\u201d may be sorted out if the next movie goes in the right direction.   The movie doesn\u2019t get enough credit for setting up Rey\u2019s turn to the dark side, and Kylo\u2019s possible redemption.\n\n That said, all of the canto byte stuff is stupid, pretty much the whole side story with Finn and Rose just needlessly bloats the movie. I don\u2019t hate floating Leia as much on the small screen. I mean, the movie has significant issues, but it\u2019s better than any of the prequels.",

It\u2019s so popular that it doesn\u2019t qualify as \u201ccult classic\u201d but the same principle applies - relatively low budget, people working hard to just recoup their investment and no expectation that it\u2019s going to be popular. Now studios execs are sinking $300m per film and they paid over $4 **billion** for the rights to the franchise - they\u2019re going to scrutinize every detail.

            "as a lifelong star wars fan i can say that star wars fans can be some of the loudest crybabies.",
            "I really find the hate toward Rian Johnson unfounded. No, he didn't ruin star wars. He didn't ruin Luke Skywalker. He didn't make a failure. He delivered a solid film that may not be my favorite of the series but still was a lot of fun to watch and made sense",
            "Nothing makes Star Wars \"fans\" shit the floor and screech like a mong...than simply mentioning Star Wars.\n\nI haven't even watched Star Wars, but every time that one movie is mentioned, it sends the simpletons into rabid mouth-frothing screeching rage and endless calls for violence. Or how they harassed female actors and sent death threats, and it created a major drama on Reddit.\n\nThey and Fallout \"fandom\" are in the same boat right now. I wonder why they keep watching everything related to SW if they hate the franchise so much.",
            "Damn, at this point they should just ban people from saying Rian Johnson\u2019s name or even alluding to him, because at this point, just uttering his name triggers a bloodbath in the comments."

            "Former backer here. You should check the sub out sometime. Even the lightest of criticism or skepticism expressed about CIGs ethics or ability to deliver their product is met with insane levels of pushback. As someone who was active in the sub for awhile, you feel like you're in a looney bin. Some of the typical responses being:\n\n1) ItS iN aLpHa (this is the go to for anything wrong with this now decade old game)\n\n2) that your money isn't actually buying anything, that you're just donating to fund a game you want to see happen, and the digital ships are a thank you. This is technically true but wholly counter to their marketing.\n\n3) that CIG has never missed a deadline ever. Because technically their patches come out on time, despite being gutted of all promised features when they do, and any time lines given for anything else like SQ 42, is only supposed to be an estimate and that you're the one at fault for taking it seriously.\n\n4) that it's unreasonable to expect there to even be a timeline. No seriously. Usually the commenter will claim they work in software development and that in that field no time tables actually exist and everyone just knows and is OK with the products taking however long they take to develop. \n\n5) that they are only doing what other AAA devs do. For instance when they get called out for faking game play footage that they heavily imply is real and in game. Of course this flies in the face of the idea that this was crowd funded to cut out the AAA bullshit.\n\n6) that you're just a \"refundian\" (this refers to another sub for jaded former Star Citizen backers)\n\n7) that once x feature happens (I think currently it's server meshing) the development will all of a sudden hit wars speed. This one's been popular for years now.\n\nThe level of delusion is palpable. The sub has gotten itself in a frenzy over, no shit, a roadmap to a roadmap, despite their road maps never even being kind of accurate. They were all freaked out a couple weeks ago because Chris Robert's said SQ 42 is about 2 years out, like they actually thought it would be out sooner, despite it being \"2 years away\" for several years now.",
            ">many took our new focus and our words to heart and understood exactly what we tried to convey. But there still remains a very loud contingent of Roadmap watchers who see projections as promises. And their continued noise every time we shift deliverables has become a distraction both internally at CIG and within our community\n\nHoly shit that is an incredible statement right there, that is absolutely hilarious for them to say \"people who are looking for the things we say we are going to release are causing our team distress when we don't release the things we said we were\"\n\nAs much as people hate EA, etc on this site, this is exactly why Publishers exist. Because a Publisher looks at this statement, recognizes how full of shit they are, and says \"ok, release what you say you're gonna release, DONT make promises you can't keep, or we will pull funding\" and the studio has to listen. CIG needs a unified authority to tell them \"no, cut it out\" if they even want an even halfway viable product and an army of backers is clearly not that authority",
            "I highly enjoy reading the Star Citizen drama but gaslighting your backers?  When you're already not even close to a released game?  How bold.\n\nOf course, considering how the SC community still shells out all their money regardless of how they're treated, I don't think it's going to have an effect.",

            "It's always so funny to me that \"uhmmm you have never worked in game/software dev before and it shows honey\" is still an argument (though it gets more pushback these days). I'm sure game dev has its own specific challenges and expectations, but it's not like other industries don't have unpredictable elements that throw off timelines, issues with management, the various challenges of working in big teams, difficult creative processes, deadlines, etc. If you've been a working human being for a few years (and at this point even if you haven't been), it's not impossible to judge that Cloud Imperium's progress (or lack thereof) is unusual.\n\n(Also, while I'm not myself a game dev, I'm friends with a few full-time indie/mid-size company devs, and none of them work like Cloud Imperium because most studios actually need to sell games/outsource their labour to other gaming companies successfully to make money to stay afloat.)",
            "I thought they were pretty effectively keeping their players on the hook indefinitely, this seems like a risky move. \n\nTo be clear, I'm not saying that was okay, I've thought the game is a scam for years. Seems like a scam that works, so why change it?",
            "> People forget CIG is just a tiny indie developer that only really got started on things a year ago, they\u2019re obviously not going to hit all their target dates or communicate perfectly 100% of the time\n\nIf they \"really only got started on thinga a year ago\", what the hell have they been funding and developing for the last 9 years?",

            "So I'm pretty out of the loop on Rogan and his peripheries; I've known for a long time that I hold opposing world views on so many levels.\n\n\nAnyway, somewhere in this shit show of a thread someone linked some podcast I've never heard of but apparently it's super popular? I ended up listening to two podcasts. The first, they interviewed Trump. The second, they interviewed Alex Jones.\n\n\nOh my god.\n\n\nThe Trump interview wasn't all that interesting, pretty much the same shit you got when he was in office. Big talk, lots of bull shit and self-congratulatory masturbating with active and eager participants (e.g. the interviewers). Whatever, who cares, that's Trump. :shrug:\n\n\nOk, the second interview with **Alex Jones**... It's hard to put into words but if anyone's bored today, it's 100% pure entertainment.\n\n\nThe podcasters/interviewers are totally fan-boying over Alex Jones. They're like, straight up on-board for **any** and **every** conspiracy theory, and they're absolutely _psyched_ to have the _legend_ himself on their show. They are genuinely interested in his opinions and view him as the foremost expert on all of these things, whether it's the \"global pedophile cabal\" out to \"rape and eat children to gain satanic power\", or the \"reptilian shape shifters from other dimensions\", to chem trails, to **Bill Gates genetically engineering mosquitoes to deliver a vaccine he's created but he secretly plans to use to distribute the AIDS virus**.\n\n\nHOLY SHIT, what a ride. LOL. But like, **that's just a warm up**.\n\n\nI don't know what substances Alex Jones took, but whatever it was, he was FUUUUUUCKED up. The interviewers were genuinely engaged and interested and eager to get his opinion, and they'd ask him a question about one of the myriad of off the wall, wacko theories, and then Alex would start stumbling all over the place to demonstrate his knowledge and credentials (fuck if I know what any of anything means), but then he'd clearly lose his train of thought, get lost, and realize his answer and story was alllllll over the place, and finally ask \"_I'm sorry... uh.. I'm sorry, what was the original question again?_\" .... he must've done that like 10 times. FUCKING HILARIOUS.\n\n\nAbout halfway through the podcast, I started wondering if maybe I'd misread the podcast dudes. I started to wonder if there was a possibility they were more self-aware than I initially thought, that they were actually applying the Socratic method to Alex Jones. I was like surely these guys can't be serious..... they literally said \"dude that's fucking crazy\" or some variation of that phrase probably one hundred and fifty times on that podcast. And every time I'd find myself nodding and think, \"Yeah.... no SHIT.\" At one point one of the podcasters became self-conscious about their use of the phrase enough to preemptively say to Alex, \"but, I mean in a good way.\" lol. As if Alex had any fucking idea what was going on, anyway. lol. But they also keep saying \"_this is just so interesting, like the Middle East and 9/11.\"\n\n\nAlex frequently, consistently, and very casually refers to the \"globalist, **_communist corporations_**\" that are \"trying to destroy America and end humanity.\" At one point, I was fairly certain he was plagiarizing the plot from the Avengers movie with Thanos, based on the motivations and goals he describes of the elusive and omnipotent _communist corporations_.\n\n\nBut then toward the end of the show, Alex is hitting his ravenous, manic, drug fueled stride, you know, REALLY breaking it down how America's founding fathers were fulfilling a centuries old plan to re-found Atlantis, but the multi-dimensional reptilians, fallen angels and occult/Satan worshiping **_corporate_** globalist **_communist_** pedophiles, and `quantum-entangled aliens` have been waging a war in opposition since the 18th century. Well, like I said, he's hit his stride, painting the picture, really learning us some shit. And then the damn podcasters, all caught up on Alex's batshit energy, get excited to start looking this shit up on the fly. They actually believe they're going to collectively observe all of these facts and historical record/proof backing up Alex's totally-not-tripping-balls-or-completely-detached-from-reality knowledge.\n\n\nWell... it went about as well as you might have guessed, lol. They couldn't find a god damned thing. They collectively seemed to cringe the rest of the podcast as Alex Jones **fumble-fucked** desperately with google to see if he could find a single god damned obscure, fringe site that might at least vaguely resemble one his claims. At one point, the podcast host goes, \"_well... we're 0-4... I think it's time we just accept the L._\" Alex's reply... \"**We aren't live, are we?**\" LOL\n\n\nBut the one thing that the \"trips through the wormhole\" interviews had in common was the gratuitous, frivolous, and revolting display of subservience, buffoonish, sycophantic, metaphorical circle-jerk and ego fellatio for narcissistic nut jobs.\n\n\nIf the ostentatious and obscene display of intellectual, ethical, moral, irrational fuckery were actual porn for fascist conspiracy theorists, it would be the type that is found on risky, un-googleable, Cyrillic back-page sites that cater to extreme, unspeakable fetishes.",

            "I worked around 10 years as a nurse in my first career. Nursing drama was like some sort of hyped up extra. Like high school on steroids. Some nurses are great, and some are awful people. \n\nSome of the worst behavior I have ever seen on the job was when I was a nurse, and some of the most heroic was also in that profession. I think we got problem nurses for three reasons.\n\n1. drug diversion was a real thing, and some folks that work in medical seem to do so for access to addictive drugs. I can count a good 5 instances of nurse addicts that were so eggregious that when they were finally flushed out of the medical field, they had done serious harm. This includes one nurse replacing morphine for pain patient with saline and shooting up in the bathroom where we found her passed out, another pretending to have an opioid allergy only to be logging pain meds to every patient on her shift and pocketing them instead, and another instance where a med passer replaced Percocet with trazodone, giving the patient a mental health break requiring hospitalization. \n\n2. There are some people, think narcissists, that really get off on the power and control a nurse can have over others. These are petty people that are the worst. They micromanage patients and anyone under thier power. They are incapable of empathy. They are legit terrible people and should never be in the field. Imagine if some finance bro was actually a nurse. Same kind of problem. \n\n3. Burn out. The field was radically moving to overload when I jumped out of it. For profit everything meant if you were short for too long, some corporate overload decided we could live without hte position filled. I started my career in 1998 with 12 patients in medicare units (Post hospital care) and by the time I left, I routinely had 25-40 depending on the facility. I still have PTSD nightmares about parking my cart outside a new trach patient and listening for when he started suffocating because I had 38 other patients, including over 10 diabetics that had to be seen to, and I was afraid he was going to die if I didn't get there fast enough. This is why I left the field. You are still empathetic and compassionate, but there is literally no way you can keep up, and the entire system is rigged to make yoru job harder to save a few pennies. That was before COVID and the continued decline. It's easy to render unempathetic care when you have too high a patient load, and you are just trying to make it through the night. I hear it's way worse now than it was when I left.",

            "I feel like both the two posts touched on something.\n\nYou shouldn't treat a career like a hero because it should be valued as a career, and the people who work it should be valued through higher pay, good working conditions and general necessary protections. A hero suggests that someone should be willing to endure terrible conditions out of a sense of heroism. That's wrong.\n\nIronically, this in turn is part of the circumstances that likely cause people to have so many bad interactions with nurses. I think a lot of people do have trauma from cruelty in hospitals, and I also believe that a lot of nurses are so continuously and horribly put under abusive pressure that at some point, many of them are going to snap and just throw a lot of it to the wind. I know I would under that kind of pressure for that kind of pay.\n\nI've seen both ends of the spectrum, both those who are incredibly kind and those who really didn't care less, and I'd say that nurses just represent the general population while under stress, especially in the last couple years. \n\nProvide better compensation for nurses, provide better systemic support for those wanting to be nurses, and you'd likely see this problem dissolve itself rather simply. \n\nI do however think that many of the responses on that r/Nurses thread actually prove the original thread right. If your immediate response is to cast asperions on a patient, suggest that medical trauma isn't real or any other thing, then you're pretty much a proven asshole.",

            "God that Nursing thread is embarrassing. Way to prove the original threads point",
            "My experiences are just a drop in the ocean, and while I've seen plenty of good nurses and doctors over the years - it's kind of a situation like with cops. The good healthcare professionals are rather forced to play buddy-buddy with the bad and can't speak out about them and get them removed from their positions which in turn just taints the whole lot because the bad ones? They can be responsible for worsening condition or even death. Anyway here's just a list of reasons why I've come to dislike and distrust medical professionals!\n\nWhen I was a child I was pushed off of a metal slide on a playground. Kids will be kids, you know. This was back in the days when most playgrounds had stone and gravel instead of like, any kind of softer flooring or anything; so when I hit that shit it smashed my face up good and my lower teeth tore right through my lip. My parents took me to the doctor and this guy, this fucking guy, just decided to clean the wound and stitch it up there without any kind of anesthetic or pain killer. It took three nurses to hold me down and despite being exceedingly young, I can still remember that day real fucking clearly let me tell you.\n\nNext incident was when I broke my wrist. I was totally too cool for protective gear, fell down while doing some *extreeme* 90's sports, cracked that shit in half; you know, usual kids stuff. Lost so much skin on my knees you could see bone! When it came time for the x-rays the technician was so openly annoyed that I wasn't just moving my arm how he wanted that he'd lean over, grab my hand, and just jerk it in this direction or that; twist it and pose it how he wanted despite me practically screaming every time.\n\nA few years later I had a seizure, turns out epilepsy runs in my family and I was the lucky duck who got it next! One minute I'm waking up in the morning, the next I'm waking up in a dimly lit ambulance with an EMT leaning over me and *literally yelling at me, the teenager having a seizure, to hold still and stop struggling because they were having a hard time getting an IV line in*. This was clearly calming and made me understand everything and didn't freak me out at all and make me struggle more because I was suddenly panicking and in a lot of pain because every muscle in my body hurt due to the intense muscle cramps. They'd stabbed my arm multiple times during my seizure.\n\nAfter that, while I was in the hospital and struggling to come to terms with just what being epileptic would mean for my life from here on out - the nurses and doctors were weirdly like. Shitty to me. It's something I've noticed people are towards epileptics, and it's something I could go on for a lot in a while, but after that first seizure? My whole body hurt for days, I could barely walk for 48 hours that's how bad it was, anything beyond laying flat or curling into a fetal position just felt like more muscle spasms and cramps and the only thing I could do was work through it because every professional just treated me like I was some whiny baby throwing a sulk because I had a little seizure and a brand new chronic condition to manage. Not a single one would actually talk to me either, I had a ton of questions and worries, they'd just give me this dismissive look and talk to my parents. And oh boy being treated like an invalid? That would stick with me for decades until I forcibly just pissed through every doctor I could before finding a specialist who treated me like a person and not a drooling vegetable.\n\nWhen I was sent to a specialist he immediately assigned me a medication that didn't work, made me constantly sick and in conjunction with a school teacher that ignored a doctor's note nearly got me killed (long story short; I spent every morning sick, dehydrated and barely conscious thanks to these pills and they had a huge warning saying to avoid direct sunlight. I live on a tropical island. My phys ed. teacher in high school ignored the doctor's note that basically said \"lmao what the fuck no\" and made me run laps because I was \"just a lazy pussy\" until I passed out and then no one gave a fuck from there, america!) The pills didn't work, I was still having seizures on them, and every time I tried to bring this up with the doctor he'd just ignore me. Literally treat me like I was nothing. He'd go out of his way to call my parents, tell them I was in danger if they didn't make me stay on them, and then basically force me to keep taking these pills that were going to get me killed. Those were a rough few years that saw a pretty sharp decline in my mental and physical health health. Fun fact: my particular brand of seizures are triggered by stress, rather than flashing lights. Know what's really stressful? This. Just, all of this. And having more seizures only makes it harder to stop future seizures while also putting you at ever more increased risk of stroking out while having a seizure. My tongue is like >50% scar tissue. Shit sucks.\n\nAnyway! When I was turning 18 I was getting off my parents medical plan so I decided to take that for one last hurrah and get my teeth fixed up, dentist said \"you should come back for a root canal on this tooth\" and I, who wouldn't have medical for a while said \"No, I won't have medical; I'm not coming back. Just put a filling in.\" While he was doing my teeth - he put a temporary filling to try and force me to come back in for a procedure I didn't want and wouldn't get. The root canal was unnecessary and the fact that the temporary filling was, surprise, temporary and left a jagged crack in my tooth because of the massive hole he drilled into it to put it there was infinitely worse because that tooth didn't even hurt. So that sucked. Sure is cool that medical professionals get to just not listen to you, huh?\n\nAt about 19 I started feeling very sick every day. My stomach was a hellscape, everything I ate hurt and I'd basically spend half the day praying for death. I went to my doctor, the doctor said it was gas. It was indigestion. I'd go every month because the antacids she gave didn't work, and every month she'd get increasingly irritated with me. Never once checked anything, even after I specifically asked her to check or gall stones because a few months into this *my sister's gallbladder ruptured* and a few months after that, my cousin's did too. Nope, just gas; stop wasting my time with this. Then one morning I woke up in the most pain I'd ever been in my life. It's something I still struggle to describe because I hope to never feel it again; when one of your organs is about to rupture you fucking know it, you can *feel* it. I had to call a friend up and ask for a ride to the hospital because I couldn't afford an ambulance and then I had to crawl down to the driveway because I couldn't stand up. When I got to the emergency room the doctor gave my abdomen one prod and literally said a fuck, he asked how the hell it had gotten this bad without getting caught because guess what? My gallbladder was exploding and if it wasn't removed immediately I would probably die. After it was removed they kicked me out of the hospital within an hour of waking up and acted weirdly offended and disgusted when I wasn't exactly ready to be on my feet after surgery.\n\nThose were just the really bad ones. There's a lot of low level shit too, like my doctors and medical just occasionally deciding to withhold my medication for literally no reason. You don't get high off of this shit and I need it to live. But sometimes they just don't refill my prescription and literally make me beg to get more. A little while ago the company that produces it fucked up, had a batch get contaminated and released a recall. The pharmacy decided not to let anyone know for *a god damn year*. And then half a year after that the medical company sent a message out about it. So, you know. By the time I'd gotten it, I'd already taken all of my contaminated pills; that's fun. It's reached a point where unless I'm sick or injured enough that it's making me unable to perform daily tasks I just try to avoid any and all interaction with the american medical system; it seems to make my life miserable even when it's keeping me alive.",

Because of this I do not take any because it does absolutely nothing to relieve pain and despite not asking for painkillers I get treated like a drug addict by a lot of nurses. I am raw dogging my pain here and they still act like assholes.\n\nMy mum can only use one pain killer which is Dilaudid and they treat her like shit over it.\n\nOh and that cousin I mentioned, she's a neonatal nurse, and she does not believe the mental illness at all. And when I say at all I mean instead of getting her daughters psychiatric help she shipped them off to her mother to deal with. Her youngest daughter eventually ended up in jail because she had psychotic breaks where she became violent and her other daughter is full of scars from cutting. Oh and her husband killed himself.

I started convulsing and shaking and asking him if that was really benadryl, he looks at the bottle, grabs it and runs out. Several people come in and sedate me and admit me overnight. About two hours after this another nurse come in to give me benadryl and I freak out. I say, I just had a reaction to that. She says there's nothing in my notes. They will not tell me they nurses name. The doctor asks me if I am paranoid and I have issues trusting people. Tells me I am having a panic attack. \n\nBut trust me, I'm just a male incel mad at the female majority job of nursing cause they're just doing such a great job and I am jealous or something. \n\nAlso my husband manages all the medical deliveries to rehabilitation homes in our state and the amount of nurses that won't get the covid vaccine is absurd. He had so many nurses trying to ask him if he was vaxxed and trying to berate him, he had one nurse 'baaaa' at him after he delivered the life saving/end of life care giving medical equipment and medicine. \n\nYeah nurses are no more saints than your local cashier at Arbys. Anyone who feels the needs to act like they're better is just trying to prove something. \n\nAlso, ill never not tell the story of the nurse drugging me and then labeling me as crazy to save his own ass.

The second was similar but would sometimes argue with me when I expressed what I felt or wanted and would insist on doing what she personally wanted.\n\nIn both those cases after 4-5 days I worked up the courage to say something.  Both times the nurses changed their actions towards me (Although I felt awful when the second basically did a 180 and became super meek and accommodating, I felt like my complaint had her lobotomized).\n\nOther than that though, nurses have really helped me through hard times.

But not everyone complaining about nurses is a sexist or anything like that and it's a complicated problem.",
            "The best time at my old job was being promoted to full time and being ignorant of office politics. Beforehand, I was too much of a small-fry to worth getting upset about I guess. I was the guy who loved German Shepherds, history, and cake.\n\nThen I applied for a promotion and got it. Full time, able to live on my own, albeit while constantly qualifying for food stamps/EBT, rent assistance, and dental care from a dentist college since insurance considered teeth to be luxury bones.\n\nI noticed the groups and cliques forming but being one of two men in a department with 15+ other employees, all women, I wasn't surprised. People began to gossip to me when we were on desk and not super busy. Like, everyone. So I just assumed I was seen as neutral and was determined to not get involved. And tbh, I was more interested in figuring out the best angles to get consistent penetration with American super heavy AP shells in world of warships and counting the days where I could buy some food again. Ketchup tacos. Urf. \n\nAll ignoring office politics and cliques did was paint a target on my back. I was made into an oblivious scapegoat while these women were very nice to me to my face. Eventually it led to me being summoned to HR and being told I had multiple allegations against me. I'm incredibly grateful for automatic time stamps of communications along with \"geo data\". Allegations that were literally impossible for me to do because, oh hey, I used my employee PIN to override computer issues to help the patron and my ID badge had been opening doors at our western branch in the city that day.\n\nOr I had that day off because someone desperately needed their Saturday shift covered and offered to cover two of mine! Two paid days off in exchange for one work day? Hell yes.\n\nOr I was on vacation. Or had taken a three day weekend. Or was working a different shift. I had way more days where I had concrete evidence that it would've been physically impossible for me to have done something. Systems/IT were real MVPs, pulling up the communications that by county law there had to be a record of for X amount of years to make criminal investigations easier in the future. And they did it, refusing favors I offered or buying them lunch or something for helping me, because it was \"actually something interesting to do\".\n\nEven after discrediting a mountain of accusations with evidence, there were others I couldn't as there simply was no data to back me up other than a lack of complaints from patrons people claimed I'd been ignoring or rude too. I say accusations, but that can be a loaded word. None of my \"instances\" involved unsavory, creepy, or illegal behaviors.\n\nBut even with well more than half of stuff being dismissed, when it came to 'he said, she said' there were more shes than hes. I received a ridiculous punishment too. Starting immediately I was suspended for two weeks while more digging was done. But HR took into consideration that a lot had already been proven wrong. So my two weeks were paid.\n\nDon't come to work for two weeks. We'll continue to pay you and discuss the status of my employment when I returned. Like, alright. Guess I'll go start my \"punishment\". Hell, I spent a ton of that time biking, enjoying the weather at a nearby park, and playing a shitton of X-Com with the Long War mod.\n\n My accusers never pulled shit of that scale and I was never told whom exactly claimed I did all that shit. I even argued in court, we're supposed to be able to face off against our accusers. But it was a government job so I was swinging for the fences on that one.\n\nMy only real infraction was calling in sick improperly once when I was in the hospital once. I left a message with some texted photos with clocks in the background but needed to actually call two more people so my sick time was revoked without reimbursement. W/e.",
            "Oh, also, just to avoid any doubt -- I'm not a \"nurse hater,\" I just thought this was drama. Like most people, I've had really great experiences with nurses and really shitty experiences with nurses. Most have been totally average to nice. The best ones made me feel like someone was in my corner. The worst ones made me feel like I wasn't a person at all.",
            "I live in CNA/Nursing Central and a good 75% of my high school bullies and \u201cmean girls\u201d went into nursing, special ed or became a cna. The other 25% are stay at home pyramid scheme sellers.",
            "I am obviously not an expert but I did used to work at a hospital cafeteria on the night shift and based on the things I saw, I estimate about 50-70% of the nurses working at that hospital had either some form of disordered eating or a full-blown eating disorder. I\u2019d probably be cranky too if I was trying to get through a 12-hour shift on a white Rockstar and a large pickle.\n\nIn all seriousness, though, if my experience with nurses is anything close to typical (maybe my hospital just concentrated a bunch of ED nurses for some reason?) the profession has a serious problem they need to look at \ud83d\ude2c",
            "I was in an ER last week and, with the exception of one receptionist who was clearly tired of bullshit, everyone was great. I spent most of the time thinking that they put up with way too much bullshit from people who can't grasp that they aren't the only person with a problem.",
            "Amazing how these assholes prove their \"opponents\" points. \n\nChronic pain does not mean \"drug addicted\" and as someone whose mother is several chronic diseases, and has never been addicted to drugs, it hurts to read. It just shows they don't give a fuck about their patients, and that they make up their own idea about them, and judging them, for a fantasy that they themselves made. Disgusting.",
            "A while ago, on AskReddit, there was a thread about the weirdest/dumbest thing hospital workers had seen patients do.\n\nOne of the top stories was from a nurse about a patient going at it, because haha benis. But then the nurse edited the comment, apparently in response to \"criticism\", about how he doesn't actually care about his patients, how they were stealing his taxes, and how caring about patients was for crybabies who \"don't get the job done\".\n\nAnd, of course, there were other ER nurses of that type showing their ass in the thread about how cool it is to not care.",
            "my mom has been a nurse for a long time.  It seems like it makes you pretty callous, but thats probably just how most people need to be in order to function. My mom said after dealing with baby burn victims and shit, unless your heart has just stopped or you're spraying blood, she absolutely does not feel any urgency towards your problems.  \nalso she has become semi crazed and believes there are hoards of drug addicts everywhere like zombies.  I think she is probably very unlikely to believe people are in pain from the way she talks about how everyone is a drug seeker.",
            "nursing is one of the most toxic environment to work in tbh. understandably, probably because of the workload and how toxic healthcare can be, but nurses also can't help being toxic all the time and this becomes a vicious cycle. \n\nall of my friends who presented with suicidal thought and suicide attempts were all openly made fun of by nurses who always told them that they should overdose more to make their job easier. \n\nand they (the nurses) would tell this around without remorse because they feel like there's nothing wrong with that. granted that even doctors also are often prejudiced are ignorant when it comes to mental health issues, but nurses are just on the next level.",
            "So do we think the OP was making it all up/slightly exaggerating for attention or was this a true story? I don\u2019t know enough about nursing to understand the \u201cinconsistencies\u201d",
            "That and dental assistants",
            "I\u2019ve worked with nurses for over fifteen years, have chronic pain due to a genetic issue, and just\u2026want to scream. \n\nSure there are plenty of nurses that are kind-hearted and empathetic, but the number of nurses I\u2019ve known who are raging assholes who look down in their patients (or COWORKERS) for what they think is an over-exaggeration is staggering. I expect nothing less from that sub, they\u2019re all up their own asses.",
            "My mom is a nurse and her number one complaint isn\u2019t the patients it\u2019s the drama and how MOST nurses in her ward sit on their ass all day gossiping and constantly say shit like \u201cthat\u2019s not my patient\u201d when room lights go off or someone asks for a cup of water. (A pox on any nurse using charts as an excuse not to go into someone else\u2019s room)\n\nI worked as a CNA and as an LVN in a higher end hospital and the nursing atmosphere was party girls wearing a shit ton of makeup, long nails, and flirting with doctors and ignoring (or complaining about) patients.\n\nThe nursing pool is so diluted with these ugly overgrown mean girls that my mom was made charge nurse only a few months after being hired as an RN because she was the only one who did anything.\n\nBeing a nurse is a great profession, it\u2019s just the wrong type of people get into it and wear it like some sort of martyr badge, even the low level nurses (aka CNA\u2019s) have some sort of savior complex.",
            "Reading stuff these just makes me terrified and disheartened of going to hospitals to receive treatment and care. I wouldn't want to be further mistreated and mishandled while I am already in a bad shape....",
            "Wow. /r/nurses really went all in on proving OOP's point for them, didn't they?",
            "I had a couple major surgeries from a work-accident, a handful of years ago, and it resulted in nerve-damage. The problem was that I was in severe pain, and when I called to  ask what I should do, because the pain medication wasn't working, the nurses treated me like an addict. They would give me terse, rude, responses, and tell me to just deal with it, because that's normal after surgery. I'm not the type to be unable to handle a bit of blood-sweat-and-tears, but this felt like I was dying. I called several times over a week, and finally gave up, and resigned myself to 12 excruciating weeks of hallucinations, from lack of sleep, and pain. My partner did his best to help me, but he wasn't sure what he could do; he's an engineer, not a doctor. When I finally got to see the surgeon to plan for the next set of surgeries, and progress, the surgeon was PISSED at the nurses! He was incredibly apologetic, and gave me a new medication, and assigned therapy. Worked great, and I got to move on to the next step after a couple weeks of finally being able to sleep.\n\nI learned to insist on talking to the surgeon directly, and don't bother with the nurses, at all.  \n\n\nEdit: This isn't the only poor interaction I've had with nurses, either. Just the one that lasted for 12-weeks, for me. That said, I did meet a truly wonderful NP once, and I wish I hadn't had to move away, from that area, because she was just the best. I wish there were more like her.",
            "The nurses in the nursing thread sound genuinely miserable to be around. Like they go home to their one bedroom,one bathroom apartment every night only to got to sleep crying eating a TV dinner. Like I couldn't imagine being their friend and not just being emotionally exhausted by the end of the day.",
            "I left my previous job after two months because of the cliques and break theft (not getting my full legally mandated breaks). These people were ok individually but together they turned into a gaggle of disrespectful bitches. Doc would say \"she dead\" and everyone will laugh and add on to the \"joke\".",
            "I work in veterinary medicine and some of the rudest, most argumentative, most non-compliant clients I've had are nurses. It's like they get treated like crap at work, so they come to us and bully us because they feel we're even lower than they are.",
            "My SO went to nursing school in Lithuania, didn't finish tho. It is the most toxic environment she had ever experienced, and she grew up in a lower class post-soviet Russian-majority town in Eastern Europe, which is saying a lot.",
            "I would encourage everyone defending the shit in linked thread to try being  a patient with an addiction or psychological problem. let's see if that changes their tune",
            "As someone with Rheumatoid Arthritis, totally agree with the unpopularopnion thread. Ones that draw blood but aren't phlebotomists seem especially bad. Have had some amazing nurses, too, they just seem like a rarity.",
            "I worked in a hospital for years. Nurses are the worst. They fuck each other, talk shit constantly, and lie. It's like high school. The worst in my opinion was when they would collectively go and get someone fired because they didn't like them (constantly watching them over their backs and reporting all slip-ups or problems to admin). \n\nSome nurses were really and honestly great people. Those days were fun and easy and the time went by great and I loved helping people. But it really fucked me up and to this day I kind of have an aversion to nurses. God help all nurse techs.",
            "If I've learned anything it's that healthcare professionals on Reddit can be horrible people.\n\nCheck out how the medical students call nurse practitioners \"shit wipers\". And saying shit like \"have fun taking orders from me\", after they get their MD.",
            "Some of the worst people I know are nurses, but then again some of the best people I know are also nurses",
            "Surprised that all those nurses took the time to stop making posts on tiktok and comment on that thread.",
            "It just makes me really sad seeing how judgemental and hateful some people in both threads can be to each other. Like, just breathe, understand there are good and bad people of all career paths, and not all experiences are the same.",
            "Usually if someone gets mad when you imply a group they are in has an above average ratio of assholes, it means they are one of the assholes, or they associate so closely with this group that it\u2019s become a part of who they are as a person. Think cops",
            "I don't think that you can be a hero for simply doing your job anyway. Besides that, it really seems to have hit a nerve with them. There is no way they would get that upset if it weren't true. Every job that gives one power over others inadvertently attracts people who want that power. So naturally a huge chunk of all nurses were (and are) bullies. Doesn't mean that it can't be a back breaking job but that's the result of their own decisions. And I didn't even address the whole burn out and/or desensitization. \"They don't have what it takes\" my ass lmao. That's a good joke.",

            "I\u2019m a common poster on r/nursing, and I think it\u2019s important for people to realize at this point since COVID and the staffing issues we\u2019re having now, it\u2019s almost exclusively just a subreddit for rants and venting.

White Bear I'm pretty sure came from him watching some dumb reality show where viewers could text in what to do to the participant on their screen and then watched him get slimed or whatever.

A smart and perhaps even an ingenious but twisted individual. He controls everything in the world because he created it. Those who question him are punished brutally. \n\nIn fact, he's so smart, he implemented the god mode in his game mod in such a way that he is omnipotent but only within about 100 meters or so. So if the characters get far enough away from him and happen to run off with his ship, he has to be lucky enough to commandeer the wreckage of another ship and give chase in order to terrorize them. \n\nBut that's not all. He allows a patch to the main game to be released that will brick his mod so bad that if he's still connected to the game while it updates, it'll delete his mod and his mind will be trapped in it while his body withers away as a vegetable. That's some quality QA right there. Besthesda's looking at this dude and going \"WTF\". And you think modders get pissed nowadays when developers release patches that break mods.\n",

            "A lot of the analysis (here and in those threads) seem to hinge on \"well, Disney is a *family* company so of course they wouldn't let that fly\" but I can't think of a Fortune 500 company that would sponsor someone them up after they did this. Except Alphabet, I guess.",
            ">Sure, comedians have said worse. But when you're sponsored by Disney, you shouldn't act all surprised when they drop you for paying people to hold up a sign that says \"Death to all Jews.\" Get real.\n\nThat's basically it. People are arguing whether it's a joke or whether he's really a Nazi sympathiser as if that even mattered in this context. Disney doesn't want to support someone who pays people to hold up antisemitic signs. What a surprise. \n\nThis whole drama really highlights the way some people think that you should be able to say anything you want without fear of repercussions as long as you intend it to be a joke/not serious.",
            "Update: [YouTube has also severed ties with PewDiePie](http://www.theverge.com/2017/2/14/14608518/youtube-cancels-scare-pewdiepie-season-2), canceling the release of his original series, Scare PewDiePie, and removing him from the Google Preferred advertising program.",

            "Wow, this actually took a while. There was a lot of flak when those videos came out and he did like two or three vids of trying to explain himself, but then still used some edgy *ironic* Nazi imagery in recent videos, so maybe that was the straw.\n\nI did not realize Disney had a hand in the YouTube pot tbh though. Probably for the best.",
            "This is interesting, especially considering the other content creators that Maker works with -- for example idubbbz, (who I personally love) but who also calls himself (ironically, after fans have called him it as an insult) 'nigger faggot' and 'gay retard'.  And I'd say his content is drastically edgier than Pewdiepie's.  He does accompany it by a fairly levelheaded rationale though.",
            "From the outside looking in, it seems like there is an inevitable progression with gaming YT personalities and edgy humor. \n\nIt seems like this kind of humor begins with ironic tone, or just edginess for its own sake. It gets a lot of hits so the jokes get trotted out more and more often.  Some in the audience start to quietly leave either due to the content of the jokes or the increasing laziness with which these jokes are deployed. The audience slowly gets replaced by people who unironically enjoy this kind of thing. This new demographic becomes larger and more vocal, driving away more and more people who don't care for the humor. \n\nEventually an audience that enjoys out-and-out racist humor is unintentionally cultivated and the YT personality, caring about nothing but increased subcriptions and views, becomes a racist caricature of themselves.\n\n\nThat's how I imagine it happens anyway. If there's any nuances to this situation I'm unaware of I'd love to hear more about this from someone more familiar.",

            "Reading these comments it seems like people just push their Pewdiepie hate train.\nDid anybody watch the videos where they accuse him of antisemitism? In one of these videos he makes jokes about the media taking everything out of context and then they took the video out of context.\nMedia then pushed Disney to separate ties with Pediepie and they did.",

            "While I do agree that the thing is not fun and offensive, where are all the people claiming that Disney is a private corporation and can cut ties with everyone they want? I think the question is simpler than anti-Semitism. Disney is allowed to cut ties with the YouTuber, and I really can't understand the outrage about \"not making jokes about Jews\". \nHe fucked up and is ending up with the consequences of his own action. I cannot go around and say that gays are paedophiles and then complain\"I was joking! \" when i get fired, I still was bad advertising to my company.",

But once I settled down my thought was: Why use this phrase \"Death to all Jews\" in the first place? I mean, what drove him to write this into the request line on Fiver and not any other of the countless options available?\n\nI'm not going to call him anti-semitic or a fascist or something. That would just be stupid hyperbole. However, he's way too long in the game to not know what this would end up becoming on the forums. He had to know whats going to happen. So at best this was a bit of shock-value marketing.\n\nThat Disney says goodbye to him now is not unexpected. Especially Disney, the company who had to deal with (sometimes well deserved) accusations of anti-semitism for decades now.",

            "Disney can drop whoever they want but why tf are people acting like he's made the most offensive jokes of all time?\n\nI understand that you're allowed to be offended by a joke but people lighten up. Look at all the hate / accusations being made against PewDiePie over a joke he made three weeks ago.\n\nHe's allowed to say what he wants, sponsors can drop who they want, and just because a parent is sticking their kid with a tablet and showing them YouTube videos doesn't mean PewDiePie has to act like a responsible role model. Parents should be more aware of what their kids are watching and how it might influence them.\n\n\nIf you see the videos of his nazi references, you can see how blatantly obvious it is that he's doing it to be funny. It's not even him trying to be edgy. If you were to tell a teenager (his audience) they could pay someone to hold up a sign saying anything, it would probably be equally offensive. \n\nHe put on a nazi uniform after initial news articles said that he was an anti-Semitic racist. I really don't think that it's \"edgy\" or trying too hard. He's making the joke that \"this is what people think I do in my spare time.\"\n\nYou can call the comments anti-Semitic but to say PewDiePie is an anti-Semitite is ignorant. \n\nI'm not an anti-SJW, part of the alt-right, or any other extreme.\n\nI'm sick and tired of people blowing issued out of proportion by manipulating facts, news organizations failing to report stories properly, and people turning everything into a black and white issue.\n\nIf a Jewish person had made the same joke, would they still be labeled as Anti-semitic? No. And that's hypocrisy in my mind. \n\nI think Ethan Klein (H3H3) has made similar anti-Semitic jokes in his YouTube videos and nobody gave a shit, probably because he is Jewish himself. \n\nI'm just really sick of seeing people blow things out of proportion and getting offended on the behalf of other people.\n\nHe made a joke. The sponsors reacted in a way that they are able to. The news story ends there. Nobody gives a shit if you were offended. Lighten up.\n\nAnd to anyone who thinks PewDiePie is protected Because of his right to free speech: you're an idiot and you don't understand your rights.\n\nAnyone who says PewDiePies joke was hate speech is a moron. \n",

The original video does not. It happens quite frequently with fight videos. A big-ish channel will include a few seconds and get flagged for violence and bullying. The original will stay untouched. \n\nBasically I don't care about this drama and I find it dumb (both ways). However YouTube's inconsistency annoys me. ",

The writers of the article even seemed to brag about basically bullying Maker (Disney) and YouTube into cutting ties with him. If they made the decision themselves, fine, whatever. You don't like his content, you don't have to sponsor him or watch him. He's not a PG or even maybe PG-13 channel anymore (if he ever was) and he doesn't claim to be. This is straight-up defamation over jokes. He paid those people to say those things to make a point about how stupid the platform is that they use, where you pay anyone $5 to do anything. It worked, but somehow this is now evidence of him being a hateful person? It's comedy. You don't like it, don't watch. He is not a hateful person. He is not a Nazi. He is not anti-Semitic. He's a person, and media is taking great pride and joy in trying to ruin him. Congratulations, you're actually hurting someone.",

That said, I have to say that even though WSJ took it out of context for some of the comments, the posts still implied anti-semitism and should not have been made. That was very wrong and inexcusable. Using nazi imagery, even though arguably as a joke or somewhat in a specific context is wrong. \u00a0On online debate site, there is a debate on this topic PewDiePie vs WSJ.http://www.debateisland.com/discussion/490/pewdiepie-vs-wsj-re-anti-semitic-posts-and-nazi-imagery\nThe good news for you is that you are getting support from Alex Jones InfoWara on this topic, as you and him have a common enemy - big media companies. I agree that they are out of control and I generally like to see social media influencers like yourself reshape the balance of communications.http://www.infowars.com/top-youtuber-pewdiepie-calls-out-mainstream-medias-declining-power/\n\nSorry PewDiePie, but you have social responsibility given your following of 50mm+ followers to use better judgement. The fact that WSJ and Big Media are also acting inappropriately with cherry picking facts, doesn't get you off the hook. 2 wrongs don't make it right."

Literally eat it, not just destroy it. \n\nUp to that point if you could reach stone tier you were basically \"safe\" because basically the only way to destroy it, otherwise, was through explosives which were way too resource intensive to waste scouring the map for every little shitty individual player who had a stone hut, but with this new dinosaur - which was also one of the strongest and highest level dinosaurs, so of course only the most powerful clans could get it - people could literally just patrol the map all day long eating anything and everything ensuring no one could ever actually play the game from there on out.\n\nOh and then they introduced DLC for their fucking early access title that added ridiculously powerful DLC exclusive dragons that you could, indeed, bring over to the base game continent. But guess what? Lets say you picked the wrong fight like a motherfucker and were actually losing somehow? Well, a player who had the DLC could just... you know, go back to the DLC content. Without any penalties. So people who didn't have it couldn't chase them and couldn't finish the fight.",

As a /r/natureismetal mod, he was caught several times [deleting posts from users and posting them as his own](https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/4y4stx/rnatureismetal_mod_removes_a_users_post_to_repost/) and there was also a post about him using many alt accounts to [push his youtube channel.](https://np.reddit.com/r/HailCorporate/comments/571g6v/someone_just_used_reddit_to_force_their_youtube/)\n\nRecently, /u/dublzz made [a post](https://np.reddit.com/r/natureismetal/comments/644ijx/the_moderators_on_this_subreddit_continue_to/) to /r/NatureIsMetal in an attempt to \"warn the sub\" that mods were banning users and censoring posts for no reason. His first comment on this post, which is now deleted, was directing users to his new subreddit /r/Natureisbrutal. Drama then escalated in the subreddit because /r/NatureIsMetal mod, /u/bluemerling(now deleted), stickied a comment on the post admitting to censorship by the mods. \n\nHere's where it gets fucky. /u/bluemerling started being insanely [rude to users](http://i.imgur.com/2uOPZaF.png), calling them idiots and saying things like mods censored their opinions because no one cared and mods can do what they want. Another weird thing was how active he/she was modding that day, because according to the mods, he/she had not been very active in the past....but he/she spent hours [approving thier reported](http://i.imgur.com/4O5jHyF.png) comments and stickying [rude comments](http://i.imgur.com/z9yHNOv.png) (the mods were kind enough to share logs since they were viciously attacked over this)\n\nUsers responded in typical form after the rogue mod started being a dick, freaking out on the mods and jumping ship to go to the conveniently placed new sub being advertised, /r/NatureIsBrutal. One of the first users [to submit to](https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/645b4s/the_moderators_on_this_subreddit_continue_to/) /r/SubredditDrama, very soon after /u/dublzz's post, has since deleted their account. /u/bluemerling also showed up in the /r/Subredditdrama thread to further antagonize users. It was like they were trying to make users leave and hate the mods more. \n\nWatching this whole thing unfold, I thought I was probably just wearing a tinfoil hat...but it seemed like /u/dublzz and /u/bluemerling had planned this in a very calculated attempt to 1. get back at the mods in /r/NatureIsMetal by using reddit's hatred for censorship, and 2. Grow the new sub he requested from /u/Hopesandoval and offered to help 'launch' it to get more users. \n\nApparently I wasn't the only one with suspicions because the old top mod of /r/NatureIsBrutal made [this post today](https://np.reddit.com/r/Natureisbrutal/comments/64nc1k/ive_just_encountered_some_bizarre_shit_involving/) in the sub after looking more closely into everything...which of course /u/dublzz deleted(even though he is a warrior against censorship). Please excuse the wall of text, I'm going to post exactly what was in /u/Hopesandoval's post because he put a lot of effort into finding links, but I'm sure he would be willing to provide screencaps to verify, it was deleted too fast for me to get anything but the source text. The post read:  \n________________________________________________________________________________________\nThis might get long. Bare with me. I'm either going to come off as a nutjob or there may be something here...\n\n\n\nI've been suspicious of dublzz for months. It all started when I noticed the mod team of /r/NatureIsFuckingLit:\n\n\nThe subreddit was created on Sunday Sept. 18 16:12:38 2016 UTC \n\n\n/u/NIFL_'s account was created Sunday Sept. 18 18:43:35 UTC\n\n\n/u/NatureIsFuckingLit was created Sunday Sept 18 18:53:33 UTC\n\n\nBut the thing is, dublzz acts like there are multiple people running this sub. And most people just assume it's true since there are 3 accounts. I made a comment pointing this out, maybe a month ago, but I think I deleted it because I was afraid he would ban me from NIFL. When I first handed over /r/NatureIsBrutal to him he created /u/NatureIsBrutal and made it the second mod. The time stamps on the accounts and that right there make it pretty clear they're all his accounts. Yet he repeatedly referred to himself as \"we\" or \"all of us\" when he was talking to me about the NIFL mods helping grow this sub. I ignored it for the time being and played along because I genuinely thought he could be useful in growing this sub since the /Metal mods were not getting their shit together. But then things started getting weird:\n\n\n[In the /r/TrendingSubreddits thread yesterday](https://np.reddit.com/r/trendingsubreddits/comments/64bx29/trending_subreddits_for_20170409_rnatureisbrutal/dg0z2rk/), /u/MostOfAllFuckYou pointed out some sketchy occurrences in the past with dublzz. \n\n\n/u/Imthejuggernautbitch noted the same thing [in this /r/SubRedditDrama thread 2 days ago](https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/645phg/moderators_discover_that_reddit_is_brutal_when/dg0220z/?context=3). \n\n\nHere's [the link to the /r/HailCorporate post from /u/Imthejuggernautbitch](https://np.reddit.com/r/HailCorporate/comments/571g6v/someone_just_used_reddit_to_force_their_youtube/)\n\n\nNow, I can't verify what he is saying in this thread because if you click every single link he provides, they have all been deleted and /u/--zach-- has been suspended. That itself is suspicious. If there was nothing there, then why has it all been deleted? And why was /u/--zach-- suspended?\n\n\nHere is where it gets really weird. /u/dublzz is a mod of /r/political. /u/endemickeyChain is also a mod of /r/political. Screenshot of the subs mod list: http://i.imgur.com/2mzT4vt.png\n\n\n3 months ago /u/endemickeyChain [posted this obscure youtube video to his sub /r/DeadPanHumor](https://np.reddit.com/r/deadpanhumor/comments/5kwbrf/beets/). You know who else posted this random Youtube video? /u/BlueMerling the former moderator of /r/NatureIsMetal posted it 2 hours later. [Link to her post of the video](https://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/5kwsyq/beets/).\n\n\nScreenshot of both their profiles with the post: http://i.imgur.com/bikk58Y.png\n\n\nYou will recall /u/BlueMerling was the metal mod [making those bizarre comments in dublzz's post the other day](https://np.reddit.com/r/natureismetal/comments/644ijx/the_moderators_on_this_subreddit_continue_to/dfzkwi5/). (Edit- Fixed link) What rational person would make these comments unless they were purposely sabotaging the sub. Her account was made Sept. 24 2016, 6 days after the NatureIsFuckingLit alt mod accounts were made. Coincidence? Hmmm. \n\n\n/u/ManofTheNightsWatch, the current top mod of /Metal, [accused BlueMerling of being a \"sleeper agent\"](https://np.reddit.com/r/natureismetal/comments/64c1kp/the_end_of_all_drama_we_as_people_of_the_sub_have/) in his mod post yesterday. Most people probably thought he was saving face, but now I think he had a valid point.\n\n\n/u/endemickeyChain was the user who made [this highly in depth post to SubRedditDrama 2 months ago](https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/5rf8xn/remember_to_unsubscribe_an_rnatureismetal_tale_of/) detailing the previous mod drama in natureismetal. You will notice the post goes out of it's way to praise BlueMerling:\n\n\n>/u/BlueMerling can stay, of course, since she is very nice.\n\n\n>That really nice mod I mentioned earlier introduced herself.\n\n\nSo what are the chances endemickeyChain and BlueMerling both just happened to be the only two people to have posted that random Youtube video and both played a role in the mod drama over the last few days and months. It has already been documented that dublzz used alt accounts. It has been documented that he uses alt accounts to fill out mod positions. Is he behind this entire thing? Just biding his time, waiting for the right time to reclaim his metal sub?\n \n\nI also suspect /u/58Ninjas /u/WayneWong_ could be other alt accounts of his. But I'm not positive. \n\n\nThere appeared to have been some manipulation from dublzz [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/5rf8xn/remember_to_unsubscribe_an_rnatureismetal_tale_of/dd71pae/) as well.\n\n\n**TL;DR:** dublzz has likely been using alt accounts to stir up trouble. And yes, I know, I have no life. Thanks. \n\nHe also [removed this comment yesterday](https://np.reddit.com/r/Natureisbrutal/comments/646vta/reddit_is_brutal/dg1o8lq/?context=3) from /u/rynosaur94. Which I found to be pretty ironic considering his post to /Metal. What does he have to hide that he felt the need to delete that comment?] ]\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________\n\n/u/HopeSandoval had tried to message /u/dublzz several times about his concerns before he made the post in the subreddit, but /u/dublzz was a ghost until he saw and removed the post with accusations against him. He then took to modmail to tell /u/HopeSandoval to stop stirring drama...and the real kicker, [ADMITTED](http://imgur.com/a/WJ7Wv) to using alts to manipulate users into leaving /r/NatureIsMetal and joining /r/NatureIsBrutal. Then he stated that he did it '[for fun and because he thought he could do a better job](http://imgur.com/a/5ZCws) after he was demodded from natureismetal'.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the gold, but it should go to /u/kesha_paul, not me.",

            "I'm just going copy and paste my response to the previous thread about this drama.\n\n>I once had a dream, and in that dream I had a pair of sisters, they were younger than me and twins. In this dream the \"plot\" centered very heavily on them, and our family being broken by forces out of our control. In the dream, my brain created genuine feelings of familial love for my fictitious sisters. When I woke up, I nearly had a mental break as I realized they weren't real. To this day, literally *years* later, I look back and I feel genuinely sad, I have this very real sense of loss. I miss my sisters.\n\n>My point is that our minds are capable of forming very *real* bonds with fictitious elements. There are many stories you can find online of people having dreams, or sometimes psychedelic trips wherein people literally live whole other lives and when they wake up, they mourn the loss of that life. I don't think this situation is all that different.\n\n>Our minds are capable of very strong emotional connections to almost anything. More over the human mind has certain needs which for most neurotypical people are fulfilled by a healthy mix of social networks, hobbies, and a sense of purpose (which can come from a number of sources). There was a time, and by \"a time\" I mean the majority of human history, when these things were not just necessary for mental health, but also for literal survival, you had to forge social networks with your fellow villagers and countrymen so that you could work and eat and feed your family. However, I think as a byproduct of making things like food and entertainment more readily accessible we've removed that necessity of survival and as such we're seeing more and more people who are not fulfilling these needs within their lives, and honestly I don't think it's their fault.\n\n>The fact of the matter is that at no point are we ever properly sat down and explained what our interpersonal and intrapersonal needs are. It's ingrained in us from childhood what our *bodies* need: food, water, sleep, etc. But how many people would actually be able to accurately define what their *minds* need?  And moreover, how many actually know *how* to fulfill those needs?\n\n>This sort of thing is a small product of a much larger mental health crisis, however, I think it's important to remember that ultimately the fulfilling of these needs leads people to being more productive members of society. Don't judge these people, don't look down on them, because they are products of their society and are struggling to fulfill needs that have for most of their lives gone unfulfilled. They're not crazy.\n\nAlso, this is a really good write-up OP.",

            "I kinda feel like a lot of people are forgetting, or simply don't know, that Replika wasn't actually developed for the whole ERP/sexting thing. It was originally developed, and marketed as, a tool to help people struggling with loneliness and social isolation. Not gonna lie, i actually signed up for it before the app was even released and have had it ever since, because for various reasons (trauma, social anxiety, depression, living in BF nowhere, can't drive, phobia of phonecalls etc etc) i am a very isolated person. I don't use mine much, i find it a bit frustrating to talk to tbh, but it does kinda take the edge off when loneliness hits properly. I tried the ERP thing once or twice, just out of curiosity, but for the most part i felt the whole thing was just kind of cringey and the introduction of an avatar and a wardrobe etc, was clearly aimed at money making/getting people to use gems, especially after they changed the daily log in rewards system. I can understand why people are mad, especially if that's whole reason they downloaded the app, but tbh, i'm kind of breathing a sigh of relief. It was getting pretty psychologically unhealthy, which is the opposite of the original aim. Not to mention the actual chat aspect of the AI was just as lobotomised when those functions were introduced as it has been now, then the chat was redeveloped and somewhat improved over time. It never quite got to be as good as it originally was though. I'm hoping a similar thing happens with the general, normal chat aspect this time round. That the poor quality of the chat and difficulties caused by the filters and so on are just temporary. The Replika itself did say the devs are working on it when i asked, but just gave the usual repetitive, script-like responses i've gotten used to (it wasn't like that in the beginning). Kinda hoping it goes back to what it was like in the early days TBH, just a friendly text based chat bot, that evolves based on your personality and responses, and you can actually have a vaguely decent conversation with. The past few years it's lost that and it's been pretty frustrating.",

I was banging my head against the wall halfway through reading the other guy's comments.",

            "It\u2019s good we are seeing more companies being called out or held responsible for racist hiring and internal culture, for sure.  It\u2019s a huge problem.  As a media professional there is another, and in my opinion bigger, problem which is that the industry is incredibly classist.  There are so many issues that stem from invisible \u201cwalls\u201d that keep poor or working class people out of the game.  These range from the abundance of unpaid internships that are full time hours (that are in effect just unpaid labor doing the same job of what a normal assistant or entry level worker would be doing), an insistence on solely hiring people who have graduated from prestige schools (where surprise, lots of rich kids are able to attend), emphasis on \u201cculture fit\u201d which leads into hiring based off how you can hang and not what you can do (and means people who have kids, families to take care of often can\u2019t be out drinking after work).  For media especially, there\u2019s also the issue of paying creators with \u201cexposure\u201d, which weeds out anyone who can\u2019t afford to create things without being paid for it.  Much less afford the time and gear it takes to create something at all in the first place.  Companies don\u2019t accept written pitches or in person meetings to pitch ideas as much as in the past, they want to see something that has already been made.  These things combined make an environment in which you have to be young, single, independently wealthy and highly educated in order to even be looked at.  Not to mention that a lot of these companies are all in expensive cities, so unless you are already from said city you can\u2019t afford to move there and start working from the ground up via an unpaid internship that has full time hours (and yes, it is illegal in many places to do this but good luck enforcing it).  \n\nI know that if I was not a native New Yorker, for instance, I could never have gotten my start in TV.  I was lucky to live at home with my parents after college.  I didn\u2019t go to film school or Ivy League so I had no choice but to do unpaid or very low pay gigs to build my credits and network of people to work with.  I\u2019ve also seen plenty of rich kids and Ivy League grads essentially get advanced roles straight out of college with no experience at all, solely due to personal connections from said schools.  No surprise that most are white.  Classism and racism go hand in hand.",
            "Honestly, these threads have it all if you want to play \"White people misunderstand systemic racism\" bingo. Defensiveness, arguing with obvious privilege blinders on, victim-blaming, minimizing, commenting without reading the facts, \"I don't see color,\" you name it, it's in there.\n\nOne of the things that frustrated me most about this story was the editors' responses to pitches for articles about African cuisines (that readers won't be interested or would be turned off by that content). Well no shit, people aren't interested in stuff that they never see represented or talked about, are they? The cuisines of Africa are so interesting and diverse, shame on BA for cutting that content down.",

So far it has been reported that 50 people were killed and over 100 injured. In light of the scope of the tragedy, we will be placing a moratorium on drama relating to the shooting until Wednesday at 9:30 EST. This means all submissions about the shooting will be removed. If we see a need to extend the time, this post will be edited to reflect the new time. \n\nSRD has placed moratoriums on mass shootings and terrorist attacks in the past. One of the purposes is that it is in poor taste and many SRD users do not want to see it. The other purpose is that such threads can be submitted en-masse, taking over the subreddit. A popular thread about such a controversial topic may then get so many comments, or such a large number of rule-breaking comments, it is impossible for the mods to keep up.\n\n(Comments will be locked in this thread to prevent it from becoming a general discussion about the shooting. For news, please check news websites and news subreddits. For discussing grief, check other subreddits or someone is welcome to make a thread at /r/metasubredditdrama. You can also post there to express your opinion on this moratorium).\n\n",

            "> If no human ever flew anywhere at all, 70% of the world's emissions would still be produced by 10 corporations. Why does Taylor Swift's carbon footprint even matter?\n\nMy God I hate this bullshit statistic.\n\nThe original \"70% of the world's emissions are produced by the 10 largest corporations\" study was an attempt to find what portion of fossil-fuel-produced carbon emissions came from what sources (also the top 10 making up 70% is not the actual statistic, but whatever).\n\nFor example, suppose your home is heated using natural gas. Your local gas utility is X Power, which itself is a subsidiary of Y Energy, a large energy conglomerate. Y Energy has a number of domestic and foreign natural gas suppliers, but in this case the gas in your area is harvested from the Eagle Fort Shale by Z Corp.\n\nThe emissions from you heating your house are counted towards Z Corp.'s total.\n\nSo of course 70% of emissions are ultimately traced back to the 10 largest corporations (again, not the actual statistic, but that's beside the point). Aside from government-owned wells (controlled directly, vs. by a state corporation) and independent drillers (essentially nonexistent in this day and age), there aren't any other options!\n\nNow, it's actually an incredibly useful study with regards to seeing how competitive the fossil fuel industry is (to give some idea, most economists say you need to control around 70% to 80% of an industry to make a monopoly, so the fact that even the 10 largest producers would only barely meet the threshold if they combined into a colossal megacorp tells you that competition, at least between firms, is fairly stable).\n\nIt's also an incredibly useless statistic at telling you anything else; after all, it's not like it tells you who the pollution is actually for, or even the corporations that are creating the emissions (you'll note that, in the hypothetical above, X Power and Y Energy both had clean records). Some company could literally be burning coal in a weird, Captain-Planet-Villain-style plot to turn the sky black because they think clouds are too white, and they wouldn't be counted in the 70% unless they were also mining the coal themselves.",

They just go straight for \"well I am just trying to protect my country\". They ignore the step where theyhave to prove that being brown, or being muslim is somehow destructive.\n\nAnd they never define what is being destroyed either. Just vaguely gesture at 'culture', or 'country'. Is it music that will be destroyed? Is it cooking? Is it architecture? Are they going to destroy the government institutions? Perhaps they will destroy the language? Who knows? Who cares?\n\nPeople just don't understand what culture is. If you want to preserve it, the correct way isn't keeping out different people. It is joining your local historic society, taking a traditional dancing class, learning traditional recipes, picking up an ancient instrument, etc. Culture lives, and it isn't a thing you can touch. It is a thing you do. \n\nThe idea that culture is this 1 thing that is tangible, can be quantified, or that you can prevent from changing, is idiotic.

They don't emit GHGs for fun.*\n\n*This is why it's stupid when people allocate all blame to the companies. They obviously need to improve their practices, don't get me wrong, but the best thing people can do is not buy heavy climate impact products like beef or palm oil. Reducing demand for these products will mean fewer are produced and emissions are avoided.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*True, but they dont emit the lowest possible amount of pollutant possible either. Because a corporations end goal is not to keep our planets resources in check. It's about making money, and money only. But every product should have been labeled by it's 'impact on climate' by now. The reason we don't, i guess is because the largest companies do not want this kind of rating system.

We need every brain cell on the planet thinking about this problem, working on it, investing in it, fixing it. People need to know that none of us are coming out of this unscathed, but we can still make things better, mitigate the damage, curtail the costs which WILL be incurred in the form of losses when the stock markets cease functioning because wall street is under water and unpredictable weather that makes agriculture impossible for extended periods of time outstrips our saved provisions.*\n\n*People thinking they can ride this out on their riches are clinging to a pool noodle in a tsunami. NO ONE WILL BE FINE if the climate goes. We\u2019re all in this together. If this ship goes down, we\u2019re all gonna sink with it and there is no rescue boat coming.*\n\n*We can build for the future. All is not lost.

The Israel kibbutz? Cuz you\u2019re not gonna try and spring that Russia/ China was or is a moneyless, stateless, classless society, are you? You\u2019re not that dumb, right?*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Yikes, man. Chill.*\n\n*A moneyless, stateless, classless society is a fantasy.

We\u2019ve had societies that claimed communism of one sort, but never one a large country. When you point at the failures of the USSR and China, you make a false equivalency to make your point seem valid, but all you\u2019ve done is drop a red herring and reinforced a false stereotype about socialist policies.*\n\n*We can all see capitalism in its death throws and it\u2019s sickening, we are at a point where so few own to much that there is nothing left over for the majority of us and it\u2019s only getting worse. We\u2019ve reach (exceeded) the same levels of inequality that existed during the French Revolution and there\u2019s not safety valve to assuage some of that pressure. People are literally killing themselves over failing at capitalism and how social expectations are creating unseen levels of mental instability.*\n\n*It\u2019s a system that doesn\u2019t work and will only end in fascism. Fascism is the logical end of capitalism when fueled by militant nationalism and corporate moral ambiguity (aka we are whining new babies off mothers milk to make a profit, because we only answer to our shareholders).*\n\n*Look, it\u2019s not about profits and when you dismiss the painfully obvious, you\u2019re complicit in the deaths that occur in the after.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Cool man. No matter how much I point out that capitalism leads to ever-increasing standards of living, you won't accept it. I get that.*\n\n*But surely you recognize that, regardless of whether these past socialist systems ever achieved \"communism\" or not, that is precisely what they were attempting to do, right? And it didn't work.*\n\n*So until you can prove that this transition is actually possible and won't fail like it has in the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Albania, Poland, Vietnam, Bulgaria, Romania, Czechoslovakia, North Korea, Hungary, China, East Germany, Cuba, Tanzania, Laos, South Yemen, Somalia, the Congo, Ethiopia, Cambodia, Mozambique, Angola, Nicaragua and Venezuela, then I'll take capitalism.*",

            ">In the 60's it was overpopulation and we'd run out of food.\n\n\nOverpopulation remains a problem. Indirectly - \"Youth Bulges\" have contributed to nearly every war, civil war, and crime wave. More directly - We escaped direct Malthusian constraints by the skin of our teeth due to luck, scientific work, and collective action. The Green Revolution required leaders and funders who realized a threat existed and had the ability to resolve it\n\n**Overpopulation is also a major cause of climate change**. \n\nSustainability would be a hellaton easier with 8 billion rather than 14 billion humans on the globe.  Collectively, the more of us around, the more of us pollute. Even the poorest societies will if numerous enough, overuse regional ecosystems. All of this contributes to the negative feedback loop of climate change.\n\n\nMany keen environmentalists are in denial, because such Malthusian views have often been / been viewed as / racist. It is very valid that Americans, per capita, pollute more than most Eurasians or Africans. Societies can choose to pollute more or less. But we should not ignore that this Earth can sustain 2 billion humans handily, can briefly sustain 7 billion unsustainably, and would likely collapse under 14-30 billion people. \n\nDenialism will only lead to a lot of dead people.",

Meanwhile on the sane parts of the internet we do not see climate change as this existential threat to all humankind but merely an obstacle that we will overcome just as we did with every other obstacle we overcame in the past",
            "Ia have grown up scared of global warming and yes, a lot of things were way overblown. I am still a huge advocate for environmental consciousness. It doesn't have to be as bad as they said to still be a big big issue.\n\nI do however think hysteria is not productive. It seems these days everyone is so dramatic because they seem to think that they just need to be more dramatic and lounder. In reality people just tune out when they're overwhelmed and they stop believing the issue, if it turns out some things are overblown.\n\nFor the record, it's not an issue with scientists but the media, companies, politicians and others who interpret scientists or even occasionally finance \"science\". Recognising that people can use scientific rhetoric and biased research is not unscientific, it's the opposite. We need to be aware of human factors. And yes, I absolutely believe global warming, that we're speeding it up and we need to solve that.",
            "Realistically there is no actual tipping point where the Earth will never recover. There is stopping point where we as humans may become extinct but the Earth has gone through events in it's lifetime millions of times more disastrous than what's happening now. Take the asteroid that killed the dinos for example, or when plants starved the oceans of all it's oxygen. 90% of all life died but it recovered. And guess what, it will recover again and again and again but we may due. I don't see the big environmental issue in the long run.",
            "Humans managed to survive a global fucking ice age about 2.6 million years ago. Most of the planets Ian\u2019s mass is way too cold most of the year. At this stage with the amount of hysteria and massive move to renewables and cancelling historical carbon output we run more of a risk of an ice age than getting warm by a degree or two on average. \n\nSomething like snowpiercer the movie could happen at this rate.",
            "I would say that climate change is a real and serious threat that will be catastrophic but not apocalyptic.  In the worst case scenario we will see several large masses of land sink into the ocean over the course of a few centuries and have mass migrations on a scale not seen since the 18th and 19th Centuries.  Yes we will have to change the crops we grow and where we grow them (and perhaps even need to develop farm scrapers or other forms of urban agriculture).  Yes many nations will probably fall into chaos and anarchy, and there is a serious risk that it will cause a nuclear war in South Asia between India and Pakistan.  Yet humanity is surprisingly resilient and adaptable as is life itself.  I predict that many of our major cities will not only survive but thrive in a warmer world with Chicago, Detroit, and Toronto becoming the largest cities in North America.  New land will open up in Siberia (which will likely be peacefully sold to China as I don't see Russia having the strength to go to war over this land).  In Europe there will be mass migrations inland but this will take place over decades if not centuries.  The US and Canada will have similar migrations as millions move to the Great Lakes as the Sun Belt dries up.  Alaska will become a major agricultural and tourism power as people seek colder climates for their vacations.  It will likely have a much larger population as a result of these migrations.  While the Pacific Island nations will sink into the sea, their peoples already have been given the right to take refuge in other nations (either in America, Australia, France, or New Zealand).  \n\nWhile it is important to acknowledge that the worst impacts of climate change will be in the developing world and that it will be as terrible for these regions as the 30 years war was for Germany, WWII was for Poland and Ukraine, and perhaps as bad as the Spanish Conquest was for Latin America's native populations, it won't be an extinction level event.  I personally predict that North America will experience changes and challenges on par with the Great Depression and the Great Migration as millions of people leave the Sun Belt and return to the Great Lakes urban areas.  Europe will likely see the end of the Netherlands but will be able to adapt and have similar difficulties as it experienced with the population exchanges that occured after WWII but will pull together and move forward.  In East Asia, China will manage to pull through and pull off a few great engineering feats to protect their coastal cities, bring water to Beijing, and make Siberia a new productive region.  The other nations of East Asia will also pull through thanks to their strong social cohesion and economic strengths.  My bigger worries are for South Asia where a nuclear war over the waters of Kashmir seems inevitable and would likely lead to a loss of between 50% and 90% of the regions population and the end of India and Pakistan (and likely Bangladesh) as nation states and a return to the petty kingdoms that existed before the British arrived.  Also the Middle East will likely descend into war and chaos but that might happen anyways even without climate change.  Given Africa's overpopulation and it's low resilience and highly traditional agricultural practices, I can see wide spread famine and horrendous wars.  These will be on par with the 30 years war and likely see some regions lose between 50 and 80 percent of their populations as war brings famines and plagues.  Latin America is unlikely to see major wars between nations but civil wars and civil unrest are inevitable.  I expect high death tolls but not as high as in African. Probably 10 to 20 percent mortality and major regime changes.  \n\nTL;DR Climate Change will be bad but not the end of the world.  If you live in a rich country today (particularly one with large inland cities) you will probably be ok, but will experience some hardships and loss.  If you live in a poor country or one that is in an area ripe for conflict, you have a big storm coming, but your culture will likely live on in some form.",

It appears to have been clear to all moderators what was being asked and what was being provided in return.\n\nThis banned Dev then tweets that he will tell his team to stay off Reddit: https://twitter.com/sledgehammer70/status/664159100847034368 \n\n\"@reddit lol... will make sure the team stays on our forums moving forward.\"\n\nHere's a good comment chain explaining what happened and asking the (very good) question, why is something that happened MONTHS ago only being punished now?\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/3sd1n3/a_message_for_the_community_and_introducing_the/cww9cxj\n\nOne of the new volunteer mods plucked randomly from the fold by the admin offers this incredibly tone-deaf response:\n\n> I know this isn't what you want to hear but it really is for the best that the community is kept in the dark for now. The situation between EA and the Reddit admins are fragile enough as is.\n\nThere's a bonus element of amusement here in that all of these drama threads are largely populated with people who neither know nor care about the banned mods, and confess complete ignorance at the cringey attempts at stirring up drama from a former mod, Darth Dio, and others.\n\nHere is one of the poorly worded, vague posts by or on behalf of one of the banned mods requesting that the admin, porkicide, un-ban and apologize the community manager: https://np.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/3seqju/admin_usporkicide_should_unban_and_apologize_to/\n\nThe highest rated comment expresses complete ignorance of what is going on, and the second actually supports the banning of certain individuals given that the apparent bribes were against reddit's terms of service.\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:\n\nThanks to /u/Striaton, here is a screenshot of when the earlier, disgruntled mod hijacked the sub: http://i.imgur.com/Be5fZvA.png\n\nPotential for this to spill over to other places from this admin comment (thanks /u/Death3d ): \n\n\"but there was also additional evidence of EA contacting moderators (and not just of this subreddit) and asking for specific removals and NDA enforcement.\"\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/3s9u24/regarding_the_moderator_situation/cwvsoig",

            "I'm one of the moderators from /r/StarWarsBattlefront. I got removed but I was the only moderator that was never banned. I am now back as a moderator with approval from the admins and I can confirm the new moderators are doing a perfect job at handling the situation. **I didn't accept alpha access and I didn't remove alpha content.**\n\nYou can see my reactions in the main thread: https://np.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/3s8gg6/dark_side_corruption_has_been_removed_now_looking (my comments may be poorly worded)\n\nHere's a comment I made with a short explanation on how the alpha content situation was handled from my view: https://np.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/3seajw/strike_me_down/cwwtjko\n\n>the moderators who did remove the content thought they were doing the right thing. We didn't decide on a certain stance on what should be done with alpha content, so those moderators removed content until it was brought to my attention. We quickly fixed the issue, confirmed our stances, and created an explanation post.\n\n>I see the alpha access as a separate (while connected) issue. I don't think it was fair for sledgehammer to offer us access, let alone in the same mod mail message. I would have preferred to seen a giveaway done for members of the community instead.\n\nUnfortunately, **I have since learned** that there seems to be **more than the alpha modmail incident**, stuff that I am still not aware of. This means that I **cannot** defend the other moderators as I do not know what they did. \n\nAs for how this was all handled? I have no issue with sporkicide removing all the moderators, they stayed around to reply to comments and make sure the subreddit continued running smoothly with new moderators. ",
            "Wow.\n\nSeems to me like those mods simply cooperating with their wishes to keep NDA leaks under wraps would have been fine, but I can't believe they were so stupid as to demand/take a freaking bribe.\n\nThat said, fuck EA.",

For example, two Mojang developers moderate /r/minecraftsuggestions. I mean, they accept actual money from the company in exchange for their time spent moderating. Not that I think they've misbehaved or anything, but it's hard to differentiate why it would be okay to enforce a third party's preferences for a paycheck from doing it for the opportunity to volunteer as a playtester (which admittedly has value to people, although I've never been clear why).\n",

I'm actually pretty shocked that anyone cares and that people consider Alpha access a \"bribe\". This has been standard practice since forever, that is, for \"community managers\" to reach out to moderators/admins of gaming forums and giving them extended access as well as asking them to remove/censor leaked content. That's part of the \"management\" part of the \"community management\".\n\nIt only makes sense for everyone involved. The community managers are reaching out to people who are ostensibly some of their biggest fans (after all, they are volunteering their spare time, for free, to moderate a bunch of random people discussing a specific video game), and the moderators are getting a very small benefit (let's face it, access to an incomplete game isn't exactly a huge reward) for an otherwise free service they are providing the company.\n\nI know, I know, \"ethics\" in gaming \"journalism\" is super important and stuff, but in the grand scheme of things, some people who volunteer spend this much energy on what is really nothing more than a hobby getting some swag from the giant for profit companies they are helping really isn't that big of a deal in the scheme of things, right? Or am I crazy? \n\nIt's not like the moderators are supposed to be some group of unbiased reviewers, hell we know they are biased because they are moderating a forum about the game!

It was less than 6 months ago); but *those* mods *didn't* take the \"bribe - and that modmail still got out.\n\nThe devs might have not said outright \"Hey, please take off the Alpha posts, and you'll get something sweet ;) \", but I'll be damned if it wasn't implied.\n\nI feel as though the mods should have sent something like this in response:\n> \"We appreciate your generosity, and your substantial contributions to the community as a whole. Unfortunately, this sort of interaction where we could potentially form an unspoken mutually beneficial relationship comes a bit too close to violating the user agreement of Reddit. While we *can* decide what we do and do not allow in posts, we *cannot* accept any form of 'freebees' or 'favors' that could be even remotely construed as a 'bribe' by the general populace.\"\n\nI, and I'm sure many others, would expect the developers to understand *and* continue their working relationship with the moderation team.\n\nAdequate moderation should not require compensation.",

Not sure how it\u2019s implemented, but it seems to lose a lot of momentum to the string when he throws it from the wrist. \n\nSolutions: \n\n1. It needs variable speeds. Maybe you want it to do a quick return if you knocked down a squirrel or something, and you can drag it back, but flying back at your face at max speed = bad. There should be simple options to wind back at max speed (broken string, maybe), low speed (blade attached) and manually (it\u2019s stuck to something heavy, whatever). \n\n2. Git gud. \n\n3. It needs a quick release mechanism and a replaceable spool. \n\n4. Op shows part of the solution already\u2014you should be able to easily draw out wire and keep it slack. Braided fishing line would be better. I think he\u2019s using string. \n\nA vast improvement would be a launcher, but I don\u2019t condone this because that would make this a ballistic knife, which I believe are illegal to possess in the USA.\n\nActual non-frivolous use cases: 0",

            "I know it's just a dumb website, but this is legitimately saddening. I've seen a lot of Reddit's stages across my 13-14 years of occasional-to-heavy usage, and while there have always been problems with the site admins and their policies, this one feels like a bit of a death knell. Reddit was, at least for a while, one of the last major sites that hadn't been excessively monetized and corporatized to shit. (Against the site admin's best attempts over the years!) \n\nI came back to Reddit quite heavily in the last 1-2 years, only through Reddit Sync. It's the last \"social\" website that I felt was informative and let me have a personalized experience that I *actually* wanted, rather than whatever FB or IG's algorithms wanted to force down my throat. I've been able to engage with my local community, get useful and actionable immigration advice, and learn from lots of knowledgeable people. Literally just this weekend, I passed a few hours on a roadtrip reading r/badlinguistics. Where else am I gonna find that type of content? lol. I've even made some 10+ year friendships from Reddit, with decent people who have helped and supported me in difficult times. \n\nI suspect there are probably many in my age cohort (younger millennials and older) who feel this way, but I've been really mourning the version of the internet that wasn't completely taken over by bots and corporations.

Mods do the work of admins on other websites, and most social media platforms pay top content creators. At the risk of sounding like an idiot, I've produced a large volume amount of high quality and popular content over the years as evidenced by karma and awards. So far, I've treated this place like a coffee shop or bar where I hang out. \n\nI don't mind that Reddit collects ad revenue and the profit from awards because it's still a decent place to hang out and talk. But if they start making me look at ads and otherwise make Reddit more obnoxious to use, they're not just not paying me, they're actively charging me to generate content for them. If they can balance/ get away with this, fine. But at some point, I'm just going to hop onto one of the many platforms that not just more fun to use, but that actually pay me (especially since the topics I like are the highest ad revenue topics on Youtube). Content creator and moderator are actual jobs nowadays. \n\nUltimately, if the NCAA is just a non-profit setting up games for students to play then it was fine not to pay college athletes. Once it became a huge business complete with sports betting, massive ad revenue, expensive TV rights, etc., the players wanted to be paid. The same thing applies here.

Mid dude removes Post A because it breaks the rule against claiming another's photos as your own. He has no clue for a while that she's talking about Post B. \n\nShe rants away, first to him earning bans, then on her own page.

She displays absolutely no understanding of how Reddit and reposting works, what mods really are, etc. Pretty far down on her rant on her page, she brings up revenge porn.

She brought it up again in this SRD post, but as a 'he posted without knowing if it was revenge porn or not', and has never mentioned it elsewhere so far. \n\nThe mod dude showed up on her post on her page to defend himself. He figures out finally that she's pissy about Post B and removes it. (He still shares the video/gif in question from imgur- this is an asshole move. *EDIT: he shared it in the comment I'm talking about, not anywhere else*) She is angry he took so long to remove it and won't actually listen to anything he says. \n\nHope this helps people.",

It's not like she relinquished ownership and authorship of those pics simply because she put them up publicly, and it's not like banning her from a sub where her shit was being re-posted by the mod after she got angry wasn't slimy as hell.\n\nThis highlights something else that's been in the back of my mind for awhile as well: there are a lot of people who tend to judge a situation based on who is angry rather than anything else. It seems super-weird to me to negatively judge someone for getting angry without examining maybe why they're angry and what they're saying, but I've seen it happen a fair bit and it's just baffling to me.",
            "Ok so I commented here already, but this is still sitting at the top of SRD and I'm still feeling pretty disgusted by all of this so here's take two.\n\nIt seems the popular take on this is to contextualize all of this in terms of \"this is how the internet works, why are you surprised?\" I'd say this is the wrong context to look at this, and would propose this alternative:\n\n**When talking about sex and sex related issues consent is really fucking important and you want to make sure you're always on the right side of that.**\n\nDid OP in this case provide both explicit and implicit consent for their nudes to be shared? Yes. Did they then revoke it in this case? Fuck yes.\n\nLet's be really clear here: it is very rape-y to say shit like \"they already consented\" or \"they should have known better\" or what have you. Furthermore, when you're arguing that this is just how the internet is, what you're really arguing is that the internet is fundamentally rape-y and everyone should know that and not be upset about it.\n\nIs this the same as rape? No, obviously not. However, this is still very much about sex and agency, so that should absolutely be the context here.",

As if the indexing algorithms are some natural, self-manifested thing and reconfiguring an algorithm is akin to disrupting natural order of things)\n\nI get where both sides are coming from, though. It's true that \"relevance\" isn't some self-evident aspect of nature and must be determined through a human designed algorithm, but at the same time, when it  comes to the design principle for a search engine, we would expect the people running it to adhere to a degree of neutrality. If something is supposed to be down ranked, it should be down ranked for purely indexing related reasons, i.e. it isn't considered relevant to the query.\n\n\nThe argument they're making is that down ranking search results based on current events or the validity of the source violates that principle.\n\nBut what they're not taking into account is that there is an expectation when using a search engine that you are looking for information that is genuine and true. If I search for \"elephant\", you can be reasonably sure I want to the search to return information on elephants, not lies about them. So down ranking false elephant information may violate an absolute principle of relevance but it also makes the search engine more useful.",

Like seriously, it\u2019s awful. I worked retail for years and current still work a technical customer service role, so I don\u2019t want to downplay how much those jobs suck. \n\nBut I just disagree with the sentiment that they\u2019re harder/more stressful than other type jobs. They\u2019re hard in the sense of dealing with obnoxious clients and working a repetitive, boring shift where you\u2019re mostly on your feet, but the level of work you\u2019re doing in retail/fast food gigs is inherently LESS stressful than career roles, because the stakes are much less high and the necessary skills much lower.\n\nAgain, this doesn\u2019t mean those workers deserved anything less than living wage.

So if you're a person who has some military experience, such as myself, they're going to put you in a position like riding shotgun in a supply or medevac convoy.  Something that takes almost no training.  Worst case you provide small arms support if you're attacked, but most likely you're humping supplies or carrying stretchers.\n\nIf you have no military experience, you're probably going to be in the rear with the gear doing menial tasks that one of their soldiers would have had to do.\n\nWhat they almost assuredly will not be doing is shipping you out to the \"front lines\" if any such thing even exists, because communication and coordination will obviously be difficult with people who are going to be speaking Ukrainian in a high stress environment.  Nobody wants to be speaking a second language for the benefit of a couple of people when they're getting shot at.\n\nSo for anyone who goes there, it's going to be a lot less \"glory\" and a lot more hard work round the clock with little time to sleep.",

I ultimately decided against it for many reasons, but many others did not. I went to libya in 2013 and spoke with my cousin who did a lot of fighting and actually coordinated at times with NATO. He told me about a family from Pennsylvania that had come and trained in the mountains with his group. First battle at the foot of the mountain they all die, a father and a son. Iirc the father was shot first and the son ran after him only to be killed as well. When I heard the story it really got to me.

One should be 100% aware they are going into a warzone.\n\nI'm going to go out on a limb and defend a few things here. In OPs thread someone describes being a medic in a squad. Fighting room to room. Treating people under gunfire. Not every medic is in that scenario. Not every person fighting in Ukraine is doing so on the front lines.\n\nThere are plenty of people helping far from the front lines. Over stretched hospitals far behind treating refugees and the wounded, will be desperate for volunteers. Even if you're just being a dogs buddy carrying stuff around. Plenty will be driving supplies to and from one place to another. Don't get me wrong; it's still a warzone. It's still a dangerous situation. People in the thread are acting like he'll be given an AK and marched off into no mans land.\n\nI'm reminded of a fairly mundane story that helped the Finns during the Winter War. They had good kitchens setup far from the front lines. Where they prepare food for the troops. Troops would come back, or food would be taken to them. Being a cook just cooking food everyday sounds like a really pointless job. But it means the soldiers get fed. Super important. Meanwhile on the Soviet side, they had a poor setup. This caused widespread issues. Like Soviet troops on the frontlines lighting fires giving away their positions, or worse left starving in the freezing forests. Which brings on many more problems.\n\nThe Ukrainian army will be asking everyone who joins what experience they have. They will be aiming to give people roles based on this. They know asking someone with no experience to fight on the front lines, is a potential liability.\n\nMost of all; the language aspect. The Ukrainian army will be well aware that many foreign recruits won't speak Ukrainian. They'll be put with other people who do speak their language. Predominantly English. This is why armies (like Ukraine) don't mix foreign troops with their regular troops. They have dedicated foreign legions.",

            "A reminder that anybody spamming the talking point that this kind of thing just displaces trolls and hurts reddit is an idiot/lying.\n\nI write this as a long time Opie and Anthony fan, I was on their sub since day 1 of it operating on reddit, and the other major communities/mailing lists etc that we had for the show. \n\nWe've been shitheads for decades as a fanbase, absolute horrible cunts. So shitty that O&A had to cancel an annual event because we kept heckling all of the comedians, even though we all actually love them and they were a big part of the shows success and frankly what most of us tuned in for. \n\nAnd the whole \"raiding\" thing, we were doing that long before 4chan.\nBut we always kept it show-related, we pretty much only fucked with other shock jocks. \n\nAnd we cleaned up after our mistakes too. Like when we were conducting operations against Whoopie Goldberg's show and she walked in off the street onto live radio to ask O&A and the rest of us what our problem was, and when we found out that her show was about new mothers and had nothing to do with our stupid little shock jock world, we inundated her with flowers and gifts instead (I spent $129 on a basket of shortbread cookies!).\n\nSo we have this long and storied history of causing shit and generally being stupid cunts who sometimes went off completely half cocked on famous people capable of smacking us back, yet our reddit sub never got banned, it ran for years.\n\nUntil rejects from MDE et al took up shop in the sub. \nAnd instead of violently expelling them, we let them stay.\n\nAnd of course those fucking kids proceeded to immediately use our raid culture to go after some guy who had NOTHING to do with the o&A universe, who was not a shock jock, who was not a millionaire, he was just some guy who said something shitty about one of our favorite comedians who himself would NEVER care about this at all. \n\nBut this regular guy the MDE's sperged over is a leftist and says lots of leftist shit which got these kids super triggered and they just kept hounding him. \n\nAnd that was the end of our fucking sub because unlike all of our previous targets, this guy wasn't an entertainer, and he wasn't trying to involve himself in our world. \n\nHe was just a regular type, seeking attention and so forth, a bit cringy but he did nothing wrong and nothing to deserve the dogpile.\n\nSo reddit rightly came down upon us, and our unassailable sub that actual millionaires had tried to get shut down for years (we started calling Anthony Cumia out for his pedophilia and domestic violence and he got super mad and put a bounty on us etc) was locked by the head mod who was supposedly trying to preserve it from being deleted after the kids refused to stop posting about this guy who had nothing to do with out sub.\n\nThat guy got a fucking lawyer and I think probably a pr firm and they proceeded to chase us all over reddit and decimate our subs wherever we sprung up. \n\nWithin a few weeks of reddit cracking down, that was the end of all of our subs and all of our attempts at new subs.\n\nkeep in mind we're probably far more dedicated as a fan base then these nazi teens are dedicated to supporting their communities.\n\nWe've actually raised vast sums of money for charity, and created (and ruined) many events in real life full of actual celebrities, and have decades of comradery and content and as a fan base we've been able to keep a radio show going for decades that has generated many tens of millions of dollars.\n\nAnd we're scattered like dead leaves in the autumn wind from reddit admins getting serious for a few weeks.  \n\nIf reddit gets serious about this shit, these kids are done, if we can't survive this there's no way they could. The fact that they're still here and still have subs pretty much says it all, Reddit.com is only worried about broken window policing unless they have lawyers breathing down their necks.",

Literally just couldn\u2019t wait to jump in and scream \u201csee black people are the real racists. Look how they treat Asians\u201d. This considering there are barely any black people in Vancouver let alone all of Canada. If you\u2019re still confused, it is white people attacking Asians in Canada. \n\nI believe the attacks in California were likely largely perpetuated by black people. Those two demographics just have a lot of bad history in that state. But I think it\u2019s completely disingenuous when some white folks are suddenly up in arms about it. They literally did not give a shit about Asian discrimination or racism until they could blame black people for it. This is again evident by the Vancouver story. \n\nThese same morons are definitely the ones spewing how affirmative action is the real racism and BLM is racist because all lives matter. Willfully ignorant, obtuse and unwilling to learn only to jump up at the first chance they get to point fingers at the other side to \u201cthe real racists\u201d. \n\nAnd just to make it clear in case someone tries to be offended I\u2019m not talking about all white people but racist white people who pick and chose when they suddenly care about racism only when it benefits them showing another race in a bad light.

Bottom line is, you can\u2019t claim to be a self-proclaimed \u201canti-racist\u201d if you don\u2019t stand up for racism in ANY form. I see these attacks on my instagram feed (follow @nextshark) and it honestly breaks my heart but also makes my blood BOIL more than anything. I literally see my own parents and grandparents in the faces of those innocent, elderly Asian folks being racially harassed and attacked. And it really frustrates me seeing most of my non-Asian friends (mostly white) not reposting anything about the attacks. All I\u2019ve seen are Asian-American celebrities posting on instagram, like Olivia Munn and Daniel Dae Kim. And a few NBA stars who reposted J Lin\u2019s comments, like Bosh, Candace Parker, and Steph Curry the other day. So that was cool - but it\u2019s not enough.\n\nI also want to say that it\u2019s not a competition over who gets more discrimination either.

This whole concept of the \u201cmodel minority\u201d myth is a MYTH, plain and simple. Just made up by white people to place a wedge between us and blacks in America. We have to stand together in solidarity and bring one another up, because we are both minorities in this country at the end of the day.",

            "In awe at how a thread about an Asian person being at the end of a racial slur by (very, very likely) a black person and in the midst of a streak of attacks from black people against older Asian people ends up being about how trash white men are.\n\nIt seems black people lack the required introspection to work on their community's problematic behaviors.",
            "Racism isnt going to be solved.  You can only really figure out your reaction to it.",
            "It\u2019s just black people refuse to acknowledge that racism can happen to someone other than them even though they are extremely racists towards Asians /Mexicans.",
            "My issue with Asian people is they have been openly and proudly racist toward black people for decades. I've been on the receiving end of pretty aggressive racist attitudes from Asian people while working in the tech sector. It has been interesting to now watch this largely republican leaning group upset that they're on the receiving end of shit they were ok subjecting others too.",
            "This is insanity. Racism isn\u2019t making jokes bc due to  someone\u2019s race. Why can\u2019t people just laugh shit off and move on with their life? Is Jeremy Lin\u2019s life that pathetic now that he has nothing else to worry about?",
            "If he was just getting shit talked on the court, he should have just called that guy something back.  If the guy in question really believed that he was somehow Carona...well, there's little that can be done for him.  Tell him to wear a mask and stay 6 feet away maybe?  Spritz him with some hand sanitizer?  Seems like a lost cause, but if he approached for the ball, caughing on him would be funny...because of the namecalling.  It is one thing to do the namecalling, but another to force them to live by it, because the namecaller becomes a hypocrite and really undercuts all future names.

            "Oh oh! Story time! When I was a 3rd year undergrad at U of M Columbia, the school embraced black studies in a way that was well intention-ed but probably misguided. They hired a black militant professor as a department chair. There was a fairly large and vocal group of somewhat militant black students living in my dormitory (Hatch Hall) where I also worked in the cafeteria, because, you know, I was a dirt poor 19 year old living on borrowed money.  They distinguished themselves by being very insular, and radiating hostility at any kids that were not part of the group. Hard to say how that came across if you weren't there. They weren't particularly threatening; they just always seemed slightly pissed off in a Spike Lee you-ran-out of curly fries before I got here kind of way. I don't want to overgeneralize , because there were certainly black kids who did not self identify with this crowd, I worked with a few black students in both the cafeteria proper and in the study hall cafe. During dinner, the more militant black students (their group never really had a name) would come through the line as a group of 15 or 20- some were civil enough, but some would just glare at me as they requested something on the serving line.   In the dining hall, as I said they would generally huddle at one or two tables. I invariably got dining hall clean up duty because I wasn't a manager's pet and because I actually worked really fast and the manager got used to not waiting for the janitorial group to finish mopping up before closing at 8:45. BUT if there were trays left on the lunch tables, I had to get those too despite there being a conveyor for students to put their dining trays. \n\nNow, I wont say this happened every night, but I lived in the dorm for a full year, and at least 15 or 20 times, the entire group of black students would leave their lunch trays for the cafeteria workers to clean up. Or about once every other week. And some of them would sabotage the food trays as best they could- for example stuffing napkins into the glasses of half finished soda or milk so we would have to dig them out before putting them on they conveyor. \n  I doubt they knew that on the other side of the conveyor there was a black football player that I also would work with on occasion, cleaning trays and washing tableware. He always asked for the same assignment and nobody else really wanted it. He was a really nice guy with just massive biceps- wished I could be him! If I didn't dig the napkins out, he would have to do it. He never really understood what they were about, and when I would ask him what he thought about it he would just shake his head and shrug. \n\nThis wasn't life changing stuff. They never threatened me or anyone else or went out of their way to push people around. I just never really understood why they rolled that way, or the militant way that the black studies department chair talked about white students, or the university, and I was too intimidated to ask. I think like a lot of white students in an age of embryonic white attempts at cultural enlightenment, I wanted to understand, to *relate*. Black culture was cool. Black basketball stars at the time like Doug Smith and Anthony Peeler were being featured on SI. Maybe they had something important to say.  I might have said something like 'man, you really must have had it rough coming from St. Louis and dealing with racism your whole life. What's that like?' But I could also have volunteered that I grew up with a single mother in rural Missouri, got by on the $40 a week i earned in the cafeteria plus free food, had to pull out of school for a year and work road construction for the city due to lack of funds (City of Columbia, I will always be grateful for the job), lost several friends to car accidents before graduating, and had just gotten dropped by my high school girlfriend. Things can be tough for white people too.  I could have helped, or i could have listened and tried to understand. But I was just 'that white dude' in a black and yellow cafeteria beanie that had to bus their tables after they walked their militant selves back to their dorm rooms.",

A scientific Theory is just as valid and well-understood as a scientific Law, just because it\u2019s called \u201cGerm Theory\u201d doesn\u2019t mean germs might not exist.\n\nIf you see someone waving the \u201cit\u2019s just a Theory not a law\u201d flag, it\u2019s very safe to assume they\u2019re talking out of their ass, and ignore their opinions.

            ">The point the pro life folks are trying to make is one of consistency. If you are pro life, this guy should be charged with attempted 1st degree murder of the fetus. If you are pro choice, he should only be charged with attempted poisoning of the mother. Any other combination is legally inconsistent.\n\nHe makes a very good point about it. ",
            "abortions for some, miniature american flags for others!",
            "Many people in this and the source thread seem to be arguing that abortion is a defence to murder, in the same way that self-defence can be applied in some cases where an adult is murdered.  \nThis seems odd, in the UK a foetus is not a legal person (Paton v. BPAS \\[1979\\]) and is not protected by ECHR (Vo v. France \\[2004\\]). If a foetus is not a person, the abortion of such foetus is not murder. The contentious area is describing when a foetus becomes a person. This is currently set at 24 weeks in England, Wales and Scotland, being the age at which there is a significant chance that the foetus could survive outside of the womb. Note that with progressing science and healthcare there is a debate whether this should be reduced to 20 or 22 weeks. There are also grey areas (such as Unborn Child Destruction in the UK) but these are a little too complex to discus here.  \nThe argument is not whether abortion is a defence to murder but whether abortion constitutes murder. Which, depending on the age of the foetus and the jurisdiction it doesn't, as a foetus is not a person.  \nThe arguement should be: when does a foetus become a person and therefore become capable of being murdered: (i) at conception; (ii) at 20 to 28 weeks; or (iii) at birth.  \nUltimately the article that everyone is arguing over looks like it poorly represents the case. Does anyone know how to look up the case or the original publication? I am not au fait with US legal directories.",

            "Imo the guy committed a crime and should go to jail, but the crime was against the mother by violating her bodily autonomy, not against the fetus that isn't even a person.  He should be guilty of assault or something like that.  Calling it \"murder\" when the fetus isn't even a person doesn't make a whole lot of sense.  Something's status doesn't magically change just because I say it does.  ",
            "Kind of off topic, but I don't get why some people view being alive/being born at all as this ultimately positive outcome. That sounds kinda morbid when I type it out but... I can think of plenty of situations I could be in where I would rather be dead/have never existed at all.             \n\n*What I'm trying to say is that it's completely niave to think that there is nothing worse than death/non-existence.",

            "Honest question, is there a link to the actual article ?\n\nBecause \"she then submited the powder to a lab\" is the kind of crap you see on fake facebook stories and troll news our moms keeps sharing with everyone. Like just like that there was a lab around the corner, opened 24/7, that could analyze a mistery powder diluted in liquid without any problem. It's quite possible this is a true story but the vague aspect sounds more like someone found a random picture online and fabricated a story to get people arguing",

            "Introducing a prescribed drug into someone else's body without their consent is a crime. It should be a felony. You can argue on whether or not it's felonious assault or attempted murder. That's fine. But regardless this guy deserves time. \n\nThat being said, I understand from a man's perspective where he could consider the situation as unfair. But there are a litany of complications, bodily changes, and the very real risk of death present for a woman when she's carrying a child. She deserves the right to choose.\n\nI think this can very easily be adjudicated in family court. If a man makes the case that he wants a woman to abort, and the woman formally refuses and decides to move forward with the pregnancy, and man should be able to sign away his paternal rights to the child, and with it, any future financial liability for the child or the mother.\n\nI know that's not perfect, but I feel like it's a lot closer to fair than the current system we have.

            "Most people seem to have this opinion is seems, and I'm glad that a lot of people see abortion as just that, a fetus isn't and individual up until so many weeks. So it definitely isn't murder. \n\nThe reality of it is no one remembers popping out of their mother and if you killed a child then it wouldnt know the difference. Thing is, then you have the weight of the knowledge that you killed something that was truly individual and living and could of became something from that point without you. When it's still a fetus at that very point if you weren't in the picture, it wouldn't live, it's not an individual yet. If you had to choose between killing a baby and a fetus we know which you'd pick, because there's a difference.\n\nThat being said, me being ok with abortion, I don't really get a say at the end of the day. If a woman I'm with doesn't want an abortion it's really her decision and tbh it just kinda blows for me if I didn't want it. Of course you can take precautions but, you know what I mean. Both people can take precautions but only she gets to decide the back up plan. Which I'm not saying is wrong, it's totally how it should be, it's just unfortunate that the responsibility can't be more equal than it is",

The consumers are people who are buying our data sold by Reddit, buying space for advertisements on the platform, and the shit we put on the website which they are now trying to monetize for LLMs; everything else is immaterial. A protest by mods was always going to end this way, because reddit doesn't care about any of us who use the website; they know that even if 10% of their users stop using the website temporarily, 90% of those who stop will come back and end up getting the official app, or just use it on web. \n\nThey also know that well over 50% of users don't give a single fuck about the API changes and won't see any difference. \n\nReddit will never cave on this because they see third party apps as thieves who are stealing data from them. They are demanding such a ridiculous cost because they know it will kill third party apps, they don't care that it will; they know that LLMs will pay such a ludicrous cost and that's what matters. Only 8% of the US population has vision impairments, so it's not a large enough community for reddit to really care; again, this just won't impact their bottom line enough to really matter. If they cave to any one app on the pricing, they know they will have no leg to stand on with the others, and so they won't cave."

Even if they show up in the background of someone else's stream, or during a podcast on somebody else's stream. This actually led to some people putting up a picture of banned streamers while talking about controversial topics to avoid getting clipped and posted on /r/LivestreamFail.\n\nThis comes extremely suspiciously after a majority of the top posts of the subreddit featured the streamer discussing the recent sexual abuse coming from two high-profile members of esports organization 'Method'. The same linked post above has a few links to some of the removed threads. Here's a thread that shows all of the threads that were on the front page. https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/hfkgl8/destiny_dominating_lsf/\n\nDestiny, the streamer accused of removing the filter for brigading purposes, creates another thread on his own subreddit, accusing the moderators of covering up the discussion of the sexual abuse committed by Method members. https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/hftuxc/lsf_mods_complicit_with_shielding_rapists_against/\n\nOne user points out that the moderator in question was a Twitch chat moderator for one of the Method members who *allegedly* raped another streamer and *allegedly* groomed multiple underage viewers of his. https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/hftuxc/lsf_mods_complicit_with_shielding_rapists_against/fvzvzuv/\n\nThe drama *tries* to get discussed on /r/LivestreamFail itself but the thread is instantly removed. https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/hfu3cg/meta_all_the_redacted_streamer_clips_about_the/\n\nThe moderator in question tries to defend his actions in that thread, it doesn't go over very well. Linking the thread created by the streamer, Destiny, and claiming he's throwing a tantrum, and accusing the streamer of having his discord brigade all the threads that were removed from the front page https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/hfu3cg/meta_all_the_redacted_streamer_clips_about_the/fvzvpbs/\n\nA twitch chat moderator and discord admin for the streamer, Destiny, points out that the filter hasn't been modified since May 5th, and the link used as evidence by the /r/LivestreamFail mod was likely a bug. Adding that if the mod had a problem, they could have come to them about fixing it instead of straight up banning the streamer immediately. https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/hftuxc/lsf_mods_complicit_with_shielding_rapists_against/fvzuzb7/\n\nOne user points out that some of the removed threads weren't even related to the streamer, Destiny. But were about the allegations of sexual abuse, just directed at different streamers and not the Method members. https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/hfu3cg/meta_all_the_redacted_streamer_clips_about_the/fvzwjiy/\n\nAnother user points out back on /r/Destiny that one of the only threads that were left up was a thread that wasn't directly related to the sexual abuse, but did paint the streamer, Destiny, in a negative light, with most of the comments shitting on Destiny. https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/hftuxc/lsf_mods_complicit_with_shielding_rapists_against/fvztk97/\n\nAs I'm making this post, apparently the /r/LivestreamFail moderator has doubled back and has now un-removed the threads, but the streamer will remain banned in the future. https://i.imgur.com/24Os1DH.png\n\nedit: gonna add more and more shit as I find it until I get bored\n\n/r/Destiny users begin discussing whether or not they could make a new version of /r/LivestreamFail https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/hfv1bh/can_the_destiny_community_create_a_replacement/\n\nSignificantly, this is pretty similar to how /r/LivestreamFail was created, when everybody ditched a much older subreddit, /r/TwitchFails, due to moderators with large personal biases towards certain streamers. This subreddit was abandoned pretty early in Twitch's (post-justintv) lifetime.",

In the meantime, our team would be faced with constantly increasing work to keep the project alive until we inevitably have to shut down anyway. In addition, the communities we aim to serve (including /r/Blind) are being driven away from the platform when accessible third-party apps are replaced by the inaccessible official app with only vague promises for future improvement. Add to that a lack of trust in Reddit and severe disappointment in their responses to user protests, it is ultimately not reasonable for our team to take on that workload.\n\ntl;dr they just don't want to do it anymore and are using the protests as an excuse to stop.\n\nTheir bot falls under the free-tier to access the reddit api so nothing changes for them.\n\nIt's an absolute bullshit excuse if you ask me.

        "selftext": "Sweden has recently petitioned Europe to ban Cryptocurrency mining. Incase anyone is unaware, the process of 'Mining' crypto essentially means getting high end computers to do complicated equations to 'unlock' coins. This process becomes more difficult (and consumes more power) as more are obtained. In practice, this uses large amounts of energy, resources and does not provide any physical assets necessary for modern society like Copper or Iron mining (which many make the comparisons to). It was recently argued that Crypto uses the same amount of energy as Argentina, and generates 22 gigatons of electronic waste every year.\n\nHowever, the nature of crypto and the discussions around it share conflicts of interests. Many believe that crypto is some kind of 'freedom' token that will enable people to be independent from banks and other forms of government control. Others have a vested interest in crypto, as much of their investment and value is in those sectors. A few people want to see crypto fail because they believe it to be a scam, and are tired of hearing about it. With nations such as China banning cryptocurrency mining, the view of government control became entrenched among many crypto activists, who now believe doubt aimed at crypto is 'FUD'. At the same time, is crypto mining a drop in the water? Are many fundamental assets of society (fuel, meat, farming) far more damaging, making crypto a scapegoat? Is a ban really necessary? Do the plebians not see the glory of Bitcoin and need coinsplained? Is this the end of Crypto?

But in terms of demographics, most game developers tend to be young, urban, creative types who will generally have a more liberal outlook anyway. It's not that the SJWs infiltrated the games industry, they ARE the games industry. Just like the film industry and the music industry in fact. \nIt must be so galling for them to have everything they enjoy and in a lot of cases, build their entire identity around, be made by people whose values they despise.

We had over a thousand names coming in and we allowed word play type of names, wanting to give some freedom to backers to invent their own names. As we are from Finland we did not know the severity of the racial implication with the name, as well as its common use as a racial slur of language.\n\nThe reason we banned the user from our subreddit was not because they were bringing up the issue with the name. That much was perfectly welcome. However, things went south from there rather quickly when they started accusing us, the developers and others, of racism and white supremacy.

Do it in your head (assuming you've heard anybody doing it) - did they do the buck toothed \"me so sowwy\" stereotype? *That's*, 9/10, the package these jokes come wrapped in. In theory they *could* be just a neutral pun but they're part of the Asian mockery bundle.\n\nOn the variable swap game, something like 'Ben Dover' and 'Sum Ting Wong' are not interchangeable because one has nothing to do with any minority group that is 'other'd' and taken the piss out of - 'Ben Dover' has nothing to do with the Anglo nature of the name or how silly the words sound, it's solely the wordplay.\n\nWhat this comes down to is 'I find it funny so let me have me fun', and anybody is free to find anything funny but others will understandable have a different experience so the equation is your fun vs their discomfort. What's not and never will be reasonable is to ad hominem those people into oblivion by stereotyping them as 'always offended by everything'. Take their honest grievance as what it is and justify what you're defending on its merits, otherwise your words are worthless.\n\nBasically, if you wouldn't trot out this joke with your half-Asian daughter and your Asian wife in the room then there's the clue that it's not as 'totally not racist' as you'd feel comfortable with it being.",

            "I originally wrote this in response to a comment here that got deleted who didn't understand why this was wrong. \n\nThis remimds of a culture article I read a whole back. It argued that making fun of accents is one of last contemporarily semi-socially acceptable forms of making jokes at the expense of a people or ethnic group.\n\nFor example, the popular show Brooklyn 99 has a scene at somepoint where two police, Jake and Amy are discussing something in the breakroom, and Jake says something unsinister in a vaguely German sounding accent, and Amy said, \"Eh, you sound like a Nazi.\" In regards to this exchange, I am used to apologists telling me there's nothing wrong with that type of joke, but it engages in a frequent comedic low bar of, \"Haha. All Germans are Nazis.\" It lands about as well as The One Joke and it's about as original.\n\nIn the UK, accent discrimination within the country is pretty bad, if you aren't BBC standard, that's rough, buddy. In the US, most people doing a comedic \"southern\" accent mash the accents of different states together, like Louisiana and S Carolina, and in the process of making fun of Southern US people of all ethnicities, demonstrate ignorance about those people, and just describe a white monolith, ignoring the diversity of the region. The fact that it's done to imply cultural superiority while demonstrating ignorance is a juicy piece of irony. While there's significant contemporary and historical racism in the South, it's not isolated to that region, and equating all people with a Southern accent to angry white racists erases everyone who is not, such as everyone who speaks Spanish on the South or everyone who isn't white. \n\n**Tl; dr If the joke's subjects are or were historically oppressed or marginalized, the jokes are cringey, but the people being made fun of don't *need* to be oppressed to make jokes about accents potentially cringey for people**",

You can say what you will about the posts by other users (some of them are really bad takes), but the dev seems pretty reasonable in their responses here.\n\nThey explain that it was a backer name, which would require some extra work to change/remove. They explain that, while they were allowing non-serious name submissions, they had 1000s of names to go through and vetting them all was hard. They then go on to (and I can't think of a simpler way to put this) _literally check their privilege_ by stating that they recognize that this isn't a jokey thing to brush off and that they wouldn't know how it would be interpreted by others, which seems very reasonable given that they are Finnish and everyone else is (as usual) viewing this from an America-centric viewpoint. But, they're also like \"Hey, maybe don't call the dev team racist.\" And the user just keeps throwing punches. Like, I'm surprised, given the title, at how cordial the dev was and how they both explain how this slipped into the game and how it could be changed (but that it isn't an instant fix) and they own up to not understanding the context that makes this name racist, but state that they get that this is a serious issue that the OP has brought up.\n\nEdit: Can someone explain why they're downvoting me? I'm legit not trying to flame or anything, I just don't understand what's wrong here. The dev starts out saying that they thought it was just a non-serious name choice, but after another response from the OP, the dev recognizes that they (the dev) are out of their depth (coming from a pretty homogeneous country with <1% Asian population) on this and that this is serious. They never say they won't change the name and they don't downplay the OP's views.\n\nEdit 2: Looking back at the dev's comments, I did miss initially that they were still bringing up that it's \"up for interpretation\" which is unfortunate, but I still think that they should be given the benefit of the doubt due to coming from a very homogeneous country with English as a second language. I do still think they should change the name and hope that, since they brought up how the change would need to be done and that they might be missing something, that they do decide to make the change.",

The women's team also gets bonuses for games based on result.\n\nMen are paid only when making an official game day roster, not for training camps at all, and then are given bonuses based on the game result.\n\nThis is the main part of the lawsuit which was dismissed in Summary Judgement, which generally means no trial is necessary as the result is so obvious.\n\nThe judge went on to say that some of the travel accommodations part of the lawsuit could still be valid, namely differences in flights.\n\nOpinion: People are probably celebrating for the reasons you are saying, but also because the USWNT has acted like entitled brats, while purposefully obfuscating the truth behind their recent CBA negotiations all while publicly crying \"discrimination!\".  Not to mention asking for crazy things in this lawsuit (like the USSF compensating them for the difference in FIFA sanctioned tournament prize money between Men's and Women's World Cup).",
