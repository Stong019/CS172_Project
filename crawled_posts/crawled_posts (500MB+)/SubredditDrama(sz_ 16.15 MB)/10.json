Given enough time/popularity, a lot of these posts end up on /r/all and the mods of /r/trees feel that not only does this paint their subreddit in a bad light, but it also promotes and normalizes unsafe behavior. To combat this, the mods are now removing all posts which feature the OP driving while high.

            "I feel like the elephant in the room here is that THC and CBD are at this point, for most reasonable people, a proven medicine. The question becomes less ridiculous when you assume that the person driving needs the drug to help them cope with a condition they have. There are people out there on a daily dose of opioids large enough to kill me twice, modern medicine understands however that these people, (many of whom have been on these drugs for decades, because of chronic pain) Have developed something called a \"tolerance\" that allows them to function normally with a dose of opioids in their system that would leave anyone else unable to walk or possibly breath. Society does not prosecute these people and the attempts by police to arrest people driving under the influence of prescription drugs are negligible. Why? because ultimately these people can function quite well, and it is difficult to prove they would drive better while distracted by with immense pain. The reality is very similar for many medical users, (especially those using CBD) Their tolerance has raised to the point where they can treat their condition without noticeable impairment. It's a tricky issue which is not necessarily \"a bunch of stoners making justification for risky behavior\" as so many people seem to think. I'm not necessarily condoning either action, merely trying to point out the precedent which has already been set. ",

So I think generally people shouldn't be allowed to drive on it and it's a pretty justified rule. Especially cause certain strains can really sneak up on you. However, the other side is it's totally possible to drive high without problems and this is why people like to debate it. Remember you can have a couple drinks, drive, and still be below the legal limit. Weed is similar. There's just a point where it's too much but because it's kind of a subjective point, you can't monitor it the same. I do a lot of work in Denver and they have ad campaigns to keep people from driving. It's discouraged all around in places that it's legal.

If not then at least this post will track all the goings on over there. Skip down to the FUN PART if you'd like but I'm going to painstaking list all the links here.\n\nTL;DR: Admins threaten to shutdown WPD over a live streamed suicide, community is in uproar, one mod in particular attempts to use the situation to stage a coup and take over the sub by jumping higher is power over the others, gets removed and banned as a result.\n\nIt all started with a video of a 4chan regular deciding to live stream his suicide via shotgun on YouTube which DO NOT WORRY, I am not linking the original video. But if you would like to read - NOT see - about the story [KYM](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/shuaiby-livestream-suicide) covers it well.\n\nThe video of course found its way to a more permanent host and gets linked on WPD where it stays for 9 hours gaining momentum, presumably because of its high profile nature, the fact it's linked to 4chan, that it's an 18 year old, that it was live streamed by the person committing suicide and all that. \n\nVice blog Motherboard [writes an article](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/qvegg5/reddit-suicide-video) about the video. Shit hits the fan at this point and suddenly the sub is [under review from admins for violating TOS](https://www.reddit.com/r/watchpeopledie/comments/84sil5/message_from_the_mods/).\n\nNegotiations go south and one overly dramatic mod [says his goodbyes](https://www.reddit.com/r/watchpeopledie/comments/856yqr/to_all_wpd_subscribers/) (account now deleted - see below, post now deleted but can be un-censored). Lots of sadness from subscribers here, gold left and right and goodbyes.\n\nWe then [get an update](https://www.reddit.com/r/watchpeopledie/comments/85rl1m/quick_update_on_sub_status/) (again, deleted account, can be un-censored to read) saying it's mostly all quiet on the admin side, and whether the community wants to keep  the \"gallows humor\" aka the jokes people make about the dead or dying over there.\n\nPosts the next few days are focused on titling such that people share \"what the sub has taught them\" about death and a [petition is made](https://www.reddit.com/r/watchpeopledie/comments/85dhi0/someone_made_a_petition_about_saving_this_place/) with 4852 signatures at the time of this post to petition the admins to save the sub. Threats to leave reddit in protest of the admins, move to Voat, or change nothing and give admins the finger, etc. \n\nAll the while Rule 8 is switching back and forth between new rules and an original rule where a particular mod, we'll call Red, can \"do whatever the fuck they want\" (literally, this was the rule's wording). Ok...strange.\n\nThe rule changes based on admin feedback and we get [another update](https://www.reddit.com/r/watchpeopledie/comments/863vt7/message_from_the_mods_2/) and a final decision on rule changes that will allow the sub to continue.\n\nFUN PART: as things seem to be dying down (pun not intended), we get one more post today [revealing in painful detail the secret plans of the mod \"Red\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/watchpeopledie/comments/86dcpd/a_parting_shot/) to use this ordeal and screenshotted conversations to \"prove\" brigading on part of other mods, coincidentally, the mods above them in rank. The brigading part I admittedly don't understand but the point is, an apparently drawn out plot to remove top mods was underway.\n\nA [mod chat](https://imgur.com/a/lAETF) reveals the plans to present evidence gathered over quite some time to admins to remove the other mods, at one point saying such gems \"You and every mod above me are in grave danger\", \"You guys are toast if I pull the trigger\", name calling, you name it.\n\nPainful details of the coup are then laid out for anyone interested.\n\nWe get another juicy [threatening message](https://imgur.com/na5NCqf) of \"Don't even try to fuck with me **on Reddit**\" (my emphasis added, lol!).\n\nUsers discuss and Red sends [private messages to commenters on the post](https://imgur.com/a/EmGEt) ADMITTING to wanting to be top mod and continues to attack the \"top 3 mods\" - again coincidentally only the ones that outrank Red.\n\nOh and on top of all this, a supporting mod to Red **un-mods themselves and deletes their account in protest**, as well as all of their posts (i.e. the ones missing above which again, can be un-censored with ceddit). Oh boy.\n\nOh and by the way, WPD is now [looking for help on the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/r/WPDtalk/comments/86ga6x/want_to_help/) if you're interested to join in on all of the fun!\n\nSorry for the long post, will keep up-to-date if there's any interest.

Just...beyond belief.\n\nTo a lesser extent, fuck the Reddit admins as well for enabling/ignoring them.\n\nedit - I'm perfectly aware that this is the kind of venom that essentially creates and emboldens edgelords, but this is the way I see it...when you are *so* far gone that you actively dedicate time and energy to negatively affecting others, you mark yourself as unworthy of the benefit of the doubt. The people I'm referring to clearly don't subscribe to any notion of good or evil - if they believe in anything, they believe that there is nothing but nihilistic impulses which are powerful enough to enslave people. There is no justice, no karma, and certainly no shame...there are only spineless wretches who somehow take pleasure in spreading their own misery by any means necessary, and I say to hell with every cell in their worthless bodies.

But in this tweet, she also accidentally pasted in a quote about a court case that TERFs are really obsessed with, therefore simultaneously tweeting \"Fuck\" at a child, and revealing that she is, in fact, a super online TERF shitposter. Normal celebrity on her timeline, big gross bigot in private DMs and/or alt accounts.\n\nThat was like one week ago, and I think with Pride month here she's throwing caution to the wind in order to do courageous battle with the true villains in modern life: trans people.",
            "I'm not a big Harry Potter fan and don't really keep tabs on it, so I could be wrong, but I feel like every few years Rowling tweets something problematic and somehow it still causes a stir. Is this not expected of her at this point?",

            "Can anyone help me out with the twitter thread here? Are they saying we should say \u201cpeople who menstruate\u201d instead of \u201cwomen\u201d? Or is it just for a specific example/medical thing? I\u2019m not trying to be offensive, but I really don\u2019t understand.",

            "Odd  as it is to say, with one single exception, i much prefer it when authors stay quiet and just write books instead of opining about this or that. It's never satisfying and they almost always seem to have some hot takes.",

            "I know I'm pretty ignorant on the transgender issue, so I don't want people to confuse my ignorance with hatred or some sort of phobia, but why is what J.K. Rowling said wrong? Biological sex and gender expression are different are they not?",
            "Not trying to rain hell down on myself here but if a woman feels very strongly about her identity as a woman, is it invalid for her to be defensive? I at least understand the debate. I feel like she is saying that she understands that someone born a certain physical gender may not want to identify as such. I think she supports that. Understands that like LGB people, trans people are not just doing this on a whim. However, the current agreed upon identifiers categorize a trans person who no longer identify as woman and a woman is \u201cpeople who menstruate\u201d? I can see how someone may be uncomfortable with that. Hell, I\u2019d think trans people ought to hate that too!! Anyway, Women are historically marginalized and oppressed. Women, just like LGBTQ, have faced hardships and an uphill battle towards defining themselves as worthy, valid, equal and powerful. Feminists may have a strong emotion attachment toward the meaning of \u2018woman\u2019. One they have worked hard to redefine. Again, I at least understand the debate. \n  \n  \nI think back to that woman who identified as black and altered her appearance. She led her local chapter of the NAACP! Is that ok? I don\u2019t know, maybe? Is it different? I don\u2019t know... I see room for debate.\n  \n  \nJK Rowling is a blunt hammer on social media, I give you that. She definitely lets her opinion be known. Cancelling her over it seems extreme to me.",
            "Sex probably isn't even binary and I don't mean just intersex people, although maybe I do since up to 10% of the population could be intersex and not even know it.

So everyone is an animal, but they're all wearing fedoras and trenchcoats. Most of the action takes place in the US and usually centers around a particular American theme (red scare, Louisiana blues scene, Beat generation writers, etc.) The stories are very trope-y (as is expected of noir) but compelling and the artwork is gorgeous.\n\nThe second book is centered around civil rights issues, where the Arctic Nation (guess what they are supposed to be) are made of pure white animals. One of them is a [polar bear and of course chief of police](https://www.pipelinecomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/blacksad_v2_confederate_flag.jpeg), and it's the most \"cop-looking\" animal design I've ever seen. Of course they hate Blacksad, who is, well, a black cat.\n\n*But* when Blacksad goes investigating this world's [Black Panther movement](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/50/4d/86/504d8630a9955dc79d360d798e4ec4c7.jpg), he also gets rebuffed at first because the fur around his mouth is white. So there's this entire subplot where Blacksad's identity is a source of confusion because of his fur color.\n\nThey're a great read - not exactly subtle (again, noir) but really cool.

            "That OP is an absolute piece of shit, should remain banned.\n\nhere's a short breakdown you may have missed, it's 10 times better that it's coming from a user named itistrueredditisevil:\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/huxzcd/today_i_was_banned_from_a_sub_i_love_and_in_which/fyr6j1r/\n\n\n\n*Literally took ten seconds of research to confirm that your ban was justified.*\n\n*Since, for some reason, you can't understand the very clear rule you broke:*\n\n*Here's the rule:*\n\n*Must be still images. Must be screenshots of commentary on social media. No gifs, no videos. Still images only. Posts must be COMMENTS on a SOCIAL MEDIA POST. Not a screenshot of a youtube video, not a news article, not a solitary tweet, not a screengrab of another reddit thread. We're looking for actual banter, not lolrandom dickery. Failure to follow this rule may result in banning and mockery in modmail if you whine about it.*\n\n*Here's your post:*\n\n*https://i.redd.it/soiygiv212c51.jpg*\n\n*Let's break it down.*\n\n*Still image* \u2705\n\n*Screenshot of commentary on social media* \u274c\n\n*Posts must be COMMENTS on a SOCIAL MEDIA POST* \u274c\n\n*Do we really need to continue? You clearly broke the rules and you clearly knew you were breaking the rules*\n\n*So, to sum that section up, you broke rule 1 of /r/madlads with your 5k upvote post. That isn't even up for debate, despite what you make it sound like in your post.*\n\n*I was initially on your side because power tripping reddit mods are ridiculous but your ban was 100% deserved. People like you ruin subs. Your content did not fit the sub at all but people still upvoted it to the top probably because it made them laugh and they weren't thinking about what sub it was in and if it fit appropriately. If that's your favorite sub, maybe you should have familiarized yourself with rule one of it instead of breaking the rule and being surprised when something is done about it. You even specify that one of the top posts in the sub was from you and also broke the rules*\n\n*How else are they going to control their sub? They have a frequent user posting content that does not fit and it's getting voted to the front page which is misrepresenting what the sub is supposed to be and encouraging others to post the same rule-breaking content.*\n\n*Then you did it again. You're a repeat offender and you're whining about getting banned for it and trying to justify your rule-breaking post instead of just owning up to the mistake.*\n\n*Maybe the mod is a total dick. Maybe the mod would've helped you if you did read the rules and did attempt to do better in the sub. Idk, I don't go to those sort of subs. But if I was a mod I definitely would've banned and muted you too when you couldn't just own up to your fuck up. Playing dumb about the rules might be what made the mod decide not to help you and just be a dick instead. Or maybe since it's basically just a meme sub, we should just expect that the mods are children.*\n\n*But, again, you deserved the ban and might have been able to get things straightened out if your immediate response wasn't to explain why it's okay for you to break the rules and play the \"but everyone else can do it why can't I?! \ud83d\ude21\" card. I am currently scrolling through that sub's front page and every single post is a screenshot of social media. The mods clearly actually delete posts that break the rules but it's a ton of content to moderate. A post slipping through to 5k upvotes doesn't mean it doesn't break the rules.*\n\n*Sorry about everything else going on in your life but I just don't understand how you could get banned for that post and then genuinely be confused about the rules and your ban.*",

            "Jut a little context and be aware for spoilers from the TNT/Netflix Snowpiercer series based on the Snowpiercer movie based on the Snowpiercer comic books.\n\nIn the Snowpiercer universe, humanity fucked up climate change and now the last humans live inside a gigantic train that travels nonstop around the world to avoid freezing. The train is divided between classes, 1st class with the 1% and the investors on the train construction, 2nd class with liberal professionals (doctors and others), 3th class with maintenance workers and \"the tail\" with people that jumped onto the train without paying a ticket or having any work opportunity on the train. First season show us the journey of Layton, a tailie and his revolution to destroy the class system and liberate the tail from the oppression of the train operators. The owner of the train Mr. Wilford was always believed to being in the operator cabin but at the end of the first season is discovered that he was actually left behind because Melanie, the chief engineer of the train, saw that he was a fucking fascist and were going to reign in terror on the train. But in a final episode plot twist Mr. Wilford appears again in a second train, Big Alice, and connects himself to Snowpiercer. Now he has come back and wants his train back. He as crazy and sadistic as you can imagine (he likes to force people into bathing with him and force them to cut theirs veins just to save them). And fast forward to last episode he finally gained back control of Snowpiercer. Our OP said that he is Team Wilford, that is alike as saying that you are Team Sauron, or even Team Hitler. \n\nEdit: I also like to add that Layton never got to actually command the train as he wanted, a democracy with  representatives of each sector of the train, because the moment he seized control Mr. Wilford come back and Layton had to establish a martial order until they could solve the \"Wilford problem\".\n\n[Here's the incredible cold take of saying that slave owners lost their freedom of owning slaves](https://www.reddit.com/r/snowpiercer/comments/m5o4ao/spoilers_season_2_episode_8_discussion_thread_the/grcezky).

Doing unsavory and dangerous, but low skill, jobs like sticking their hands into running machinery to maintain parts. \n\nKind of like how plantations in the south wouldn't be able to run if not for the slaves.

She has garnered a (very) loyal fanbase among left-wing circles.   \n\nIn a recent video of hers, Contrapoints used the voice of well known Transmedicalist Buck Angel.

Transmedicalist are generally negatively viewed in transgender circles because they are so exclusionary. Kind of like TERFS.\n\nNo surprise, this has earned Contrapoints a lot of criticism, with people pointing our her (semi-recent) 'questionable' takes on what it means to be trans (specifically her The Aesthetic video and the twitter comments made in its wake, but that's a whole 'nother can of worms).

I didn't know she sidled up to Buck Angel. \n\nMost of the Truscum I have met, especially when I started my transition and was being swamped with the assholes on Tumblr (Used to have a great trans masculine community) were proud of their title. This was years ago, but I learned the term from the other trans guys that self identified as Truscum. They would put Truscum in their blog posts, descriptions, and proudly tell you while they were also telling you to go kill yourself because you didn't fit their idea of what transgender is. \n\nI heard about Truscum far before I heard it toned down into Transmedicalist. Same vile behavior, though. If you don't adhere to their idea of what transgender means to you, they will also come out swinging with some incredibly vile shit against other transgender folks. Transmed's try to put some veneer of acceptability over it, but at the end of the day they deny non-dysphoric transgender people, and anyone non-binary folks. If you don't agree there is a problem with you.\n\nAlso, as a transgender man, fuck Buck Angel. He was the first transgender men I ever saw in the media, and Buck Angel tried a pyramid scheme targeting other transgender folks. He has time and again said some shitty things against other transgender people. Hell, I heard him on a Savage Love podcast just brutally ripping on a very young, newly transitioning transman because the kid just wanted dating advice because he was gay, and wasn't on testosterone yet. (Fuck Dan Savage, too, for laughing and carrying on like that was okay.) Buck has a history of this kind of behavior. I was very disgusted because with all that is stacked up against us, you'd think we wouldn't do this to ourselves. \n\nNote of reference, I am a non-dysphoric transgender man that is post-transition. That means all the testosterone, all the surgeries. I live fully male, and am read as cisgendered male by pretty much everyone. I have been targeted by self identified Truscum and Transmed's for years and years now because I am very open about myself. I wrote a book, and had a blog. I watch these folks target new transitioners. They pretty much pioneered the term Transtrender, as a term of derision for anyone they think is playing at being transgender.",

Gotta ask, what exactly did he do that led to being completely blackballed?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: OK I did way too much research on this. My conclusion is that he's not a great guy (outing an ex, questionable business ventures) and he holds a super strong position that transsexual != transgender and doesn't look too fondly on the transgender part. I'm not gonna pretend I understand where he's coming from on that, but \"truscum\" seems to cover everything from genuine transphobia to honest questions about whether identification can be a bit more specific and people on twitter love to end any debate with that one word. He's no spokesperson for the community even though he tries to be but it's also a bit excessive to blacklist any member of the community who associates with him just because \"truscum\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT2: Goddammit nvm I'm still confused.",

The more \u2018extreme\u2019 ideas that you need to  medically transition and so on to be trans isn\u2019t as common of a belief as just needing gender dysphoria, but I\u2019d say it\u2019s more heard of than tucute beliefs. \nI find it uncomfortable to hear people advising others without gender dysphoria to transition as it\u2019s known to cause a lot of problems, including gender dysphoria, yet I\u2019ve seen it multiple times on Reddit, but never anywhere else. I\u2019ve even seen people get banned or have their comment removed when they\u2019ve warned people about the consequences.\nphysically transitioning is a medical procedure and you shouldn\u2019t do it unless you\u2019re treating a medical problem.",

Especially when none of her videos really talk about transmedicalism and the view is irrelevant to the topics at hand. \n\nIt's a really weird place for me to be. The fact I'm uncomfortable  defending the decision probably means I might change my mind.\n\nEDIT: reading some of the moderators rationales I find myself sgreeing: trans people shouldn't attack other trans people. People using certain terms to bludgeon a conversation and shut down another opinion in these spaces are being irresponsible and should in turn be prevented from doing that. This is different from being disallowed to call someone out for s racist viewpoint: for a start generally racism is an extra-community issue.",

Some transmeds believe you must desire medical transition (i.e. hormone replacement or surgery) or change in gender experession to be a True Trans^TM, some do not.\n\n*Truscum* are transmeds who believe in only *two* genders, man and woman. Not all transmeds are truscum! Many transmeds believe in more than two.\n\nTERF - Transgender Exclusionary Radical Feminist ; TERFs are conservative feminists who are without a doubt transphobic. No ifs, ands, or buts. They do not believe that transgenderism is real, exclude trans people from feminist circles, and even go as far as to purposefully out trans people (including minors), placing them in very dangerous situations.\n\n**TRANSMEDS ARE NOT TERFS!** Please do not compare the two.\n\nEdit: people who don't believe you need gender dysphoria to be trans are called *tucutes*. I could write a whole paragraph about how regressive and damaging these people are to the trans community. Fun fact! That \"no dysphoria\" idea was reported to have originated from a TERF's twitter.

There are so many ways a religious school can fail their students. I will outline all the different ways they can fail:\n\nMethod 1: religion imposing on the curriculum\n\nThe religious studies and rituals can and often do impose on the other subjects. From prayer times, to religious studies, to avoiding certain important subjects, there is so many cases where religious education is often substandard education.\n\nMethod 2: brain drain\n\nUsually, religious schools only or at least prefer to hire teachers of the faith that they represent. This deprives the students of teachers hired on merit which also lowers the quality of the education.\n\nMethod 3: over liberalization\n\nThis is when the school tries to get with the times. Usually this should be applauded, but when the parents want a religious education, they will move the students to the public school system if they don't get enough Jesus/Allah/Yahweh\n\nMethod 4: stagnation\n\nThis is the opposite of method 3. In this case, the school is a relative stick in the mud while the community loses interest in religious education. Often times 3 and 4 happen at the same time, which is what happened to my middle school.\n\nWith that said individual religious schools can give very good educations, but overall secular education is much more reliable and efficient. With all the money my school spent on siddurim, torahs, Shabbat celebrations, and other religious items, we could have been given a world class education.",

This referendum brought the Nazis national acclaim and recognition.

In the meantime the centre-left and centre-right were busy fighting each other. The communists were busy attacking the centre-left. The conservatives felt that Hitler would be controllable so they used him in a coalition government.

Thatwould be wrong.**\u00a0\n\nThe wholeworld, was overall recovering from economic crisis, including Germany. Hitler simply came at the right time, when things were improving and took credit formanny positive changes, like many recovery and public works projects thatcreated lots of jobs, examples include the construction of the Autobahnnetwork, were actually continuations of policies of von Schleicher\u2019sgovernment, who were his predecessors.\u00a0\n\n**To decerasethe unemployment rates, Nazis simply \u2018massaged\u2019 the statistics.**\n\nThey struck ofminorities from unemployment statistics, especially the Jews, who, from 1935onwards, were not considered legal citizens. Many women were removed too, someforcefully, others through incentives like marriage loans.\u00a0Conscriptionwas re-introduced, taking young men off the unemployment figures.\n\nI\u2019m not taking young men into the army en mass counts as a viable long-term economicstrategy (too costly)- unless they\u2019re being sent off to fight a war, oh wait\u2026\u00a0\n\nThe abovepolicy also caused a shortage of labour, which was especially damaging to the agricultural sector.\n\n\u00a0**As for Hitler actions itself\u2026.\u00a0Do you know just how messy Hitler\u2019s administrative style was?**\n\nHe would often assign thesame job to competing parties and there were so many overlapping governmentdepartments it was crazily inefficient. But hey, divide and rule is aneffective strategy to maintain absolute power as all the competing factions vieto kiss your ass.\u00a0Doesn\u2019t sound very intelligent\u2026\u00a0\n\n**Here is whathis own Press Chief wrote in 1955:**\n\n> \u201cIn the 12 years of his rule in GermanyHitler produced the biggest confusion in government that has ever existed in acivilised state. During his period of government, he removed from the organisation of the state all clarity of leadership and produced a completelyopaque network of competences. It was not all laziness or an excessive degreeof tolerance which led the otherwise so energetic and forceful Hitler totolerate this real witch\u2019s cauldron of struggles for position and conflictsover competence. It was intentional. With this technique he systematically disorganised the upper echelons \\[levels\\] of the Reich leadership in order todevelop and further the authority of his own will until it became a despotic tyranny.\u201d\u00a0\n\nOne of his problems was his ego . He believed in German exceptionalism to such anoutrageous degree that he refused to even consider the practical limits ofthings like,material science when he was laying out plans for his new Germany.\u00a0\n\nHe was also lazy, not because of his \u2018divide and rule\u2019 strategy as explained before, butdue to the fact that he was frequently far away from Berlin, in his villa inBerghof. He spent most of his day eating, sleeping, walking etc. - nothing wrong with that itself, but as the head of state, this is \u2026 less than ideal. He\u2019d rant about some \u2018grand vision\u2019 and leave the details to his lackeys.\u00a0\n\n**Here is whatFritz Wiedmann, one of his adjutants, said about him in his book Der Mann, der Feldherr Werden Wolte (more specifically page 69):**\n\n>\u201cHe disliked the study ofdocuments. I have sometimes secured decisions from him, even ones about important matters, without his ever asking to see the relevant files. He took theview that many things sorted themselves out on their own if one did notinterfere.\u201d\u00a0\n\nYeah someresponsible leader right there, folks!\u00a0\n\n**And he did several incompetent political decisions, among which was the Four Year Plan\u2026\u00a0\u2026oh God, the Four Year Plan.**\n\n\u00a0This wasessentially a plan geared towards rearmament, after Hitler fired the moderatelycompetent Schacht and replaced him with one of his cronies, Goering, who had noexperience in dealing with the economy at all.\n\nIt\u2019s a classic shift towards\u2018guns\u2019 within the \u2018guns and butter\u2019 options - no substantial rise in livingstandards, just more and more weapons. It aimed to create \u2018self-sufficiency.\u2019\u00a0Dumb methods included manufacturing synthetic fibre to reduce the amount of actual fibreimports, which ironically increased the trade deficit because they had toimportant more stuff to help with the manufacturing process.\n\nThe government relied on a prolonged budget deficit, spending more money than incoming tax revenues. There was almost an unsustainable rise in inflation, masterfullycountered through foreign policy successes like the remilitarisation of the Rhineland etc. Classic example of using nationalistic sentiments to distractthe public from real issues.\u00a0\n\nOverall,Hitler funded all his jobs, infrastructure and military rearmament programs bymassive borrowing and deficit spending leading up to 1939 on the schedule thathe will need to start conquering new territories to pay for all the bills thatwere going to come due.\n\n\u00a0If Germanydid not start the war in 1939, there would have been an economic crash anddepression resembling that of the 1920s Weimar Republic. Hitler and the Nazis would have been very hard pressed to recover from that, and the people wouldnot have been happy, no matter how sweet Hitler\u2019s speeches would be.",

            "This post is completely biased since writeups should be neutral, which is why it was removed earlier. I put it back up but if another mod removes it I'll stand by that. Please take everything OP is saying with a grain of salt.",
            "This was bound to happen eventually. NSFW subs are hard to moderate and few people are willing to do it for free. OF agencies and models have lots of financial motives to take over them and curate them to promote and boost themselves. After all reddit is one of the only social media platforms the allows OC NSFW content.",
            "I bet I can predict how this ends.\n\n1. It gains enough traction that reddit starts looking into its admins to find whoever it enabling this and fires them. This likely wont change anything with the agency as reddit wont blitz the mods on there. This is probably the least likely as I think news groups will avoid having articles about random nude subs on reddit.\n2. Reddit is directly involved in this and is being paid to allow it leading to nothing happening. This is possible but I'm not really sure if it is actually happening.\n3. Absolutely nothing happens leading to most of the subs becoming controlled by this agency and most of the NSFW side of reddit becoming a porn company.\n\nIts hard to stop this anyway. A guy being paid to manage the sub is going to be significantly more likely to do it than a guy who is doing it in his spare time. I don't like that a company is breaking the TOS to achieve their goal of domination but its isn't going to stop. If the admin is fired then they will likely just offer to take the sub or offer a payment for it. We can get as upset as we like but NSFW subs are going to be controlled by agencies at some point, maybe even the main subs.",

            "This is such a weird situation. One one hand I support OF, sexworkers and I think its fine that people can monetize their service this way.\n\nBut I hate what happened to all the NSFW subs (and seemingly innocent subs like /r/selfie for example) since the rise of onlyfans. Subs are nothing more than promotion. The amount of homemade porn, made by people who are genuinely into it for the sake of \"art\" instead of making money is getting smaller and smaller and instead everything is now just onlyfans bait or promotion. And now were getting to this shit that this post is about. \n\nSometimes I wish there was a general ban of OF style profiles and posts on all of reddit, but I know that this is waaaaay to harsh of a thing.",

            "do they even have mods at /r/politics?\n\nthe place is a shithole. It swings wildly based on the current reddit meta jerk. A well-moderated politics sub shouldn't do that, right?",

            "So some interesting shit's going down in /politics at the moment that sorta' ties into this and I figure it might be worth tacking onto here until it fully blows up into its own entity.\n\nAbout 3 hours ago the NY Times published an article about payments made to Trump's current campaign manager when he was working for Viktor Yanukovych, ousted president of the Ukraine, with the gist being he accepted ~$13 million from various pro-Russia parties to help get Yanukovych in office and negotiate a bunch of deals that benefited various Russian parties. So not only is he caught up in what seems to be a shitload of corruption, that really resonates with all the claims that Trump's basically a Manchurian candidate for Putin and other Russian oligarchs.\n\n[Somebody posts the article and it becomes a big hit](https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4xr27i/secret_ledger_in_ukraine_lists_cash_for_donald/), and in a few hours it hits the top of the sub - and promptly vanishes. Exactly what happened with a series of submissions that put Trump in a poor light a few days ago right and right before the shitstorm in the OP began. And who do you think's the mod that pulled it? [/English06 on the grounds of \"not exact title\"](https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4xr27i/secret_ledger_in_ukraine_lists_cash_for_donald/d6hwzx8) - except that the actual title is exact, and the only difference is the OP tacked on a \" - New York Times\" thing like some folks do as redundant as it is. Basically the most anal and technical use of the rule possible.\n\n[So they try again](https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4xrvwl/secret_ledger_in_ukraine_lists_cash_for_donald/) and sure enough, along comes none other than /English06 with the charge of \"Not Exact Title\" - because the OP, evidently having typed out the title manually, missed an apostrophe.\n\nSo we've got one of the other mods known to be a Trump supporter quashing submissions of a rather damning article about Trump's current campaign manager using the flimsiest and most technical of excuses, within a matter of days of another moderator revealing he was a Trump supporter after a series of rather damning submissions about Trump suddenly disappeared upon hitting the top of /politics. /politics users are pissed about the mods' actions, /the_donald users are pissed about one of their guys being removed from the mod team, and the whole situation seems primed to explode in some fashion.",

Of course, since this is a content-neutral restriction, it seemed perfectly legal to me, but I spent the requisite 10 minutes on google to find the right precedent. \n\nIn [Ward v. Rock Against Racism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_v._Rock_Against_Racism), Supreme Court came up with a [three-prong test](https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/1023/time-place-and-manner-restrictions) (they love those things) to determine whether a restriction was constitutional. These were:\n\n1. The regulation must be content neutral.\n\n2. It must be narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest.\n\n3. It must leave open ample alternative channels for communicating the speaker\u2019s message.\n\nSo, is the regulation content-neutral? Of course! Everyone\u2019s being kept from gathering in large groups, regardless of *why* they\u2019re gathering in those groups. Is it narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest? Of course! The government is trying to stop the spread of an airborne disease, and preventing people from gathering in large groups is a very reasonable way to do so. Does it leave open alternative channels to communicate the speaker\u2019s message? I mean, I\u2019m not sure what that actually means in this context (I\u2019m not actually on the Supreme Court!) but you can go out there and sit with a sign alone, or whine on the Internet like me.\n\n[There\u2019s also a line in the case](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1988/88-226) that comes up often when the Supreme Court makes these kind of calls, which is that as long as \u201cthe means chosen are not substantially broader than necessary to achieve the government's interest,\" then the regulation is constitutional. \n\nSome justices did dissent on that case, but their objections were to the fact that the court didn\u2019t apply a \u201cleast restrictive means\u201d standard, which this would likely still meet (and I doubt the guy with the trump/pence sign is standing up for Thurgood Marshall and William Brennan\u2019s interpretation of the Constitution).\n\nTL;DR Their rights are not being violated under Supreme Court precedent.",

            "Man, this is definitely a topic I have a hard time with, and I have flip-flopped back and forth on my opinion *a lot*.\n\nOn one hand, I know that I would never be able to take care of a child with developmental issues and handicaps. I don\u2019t handle stress very well, and I know I would end up terminating if I found out a baby of mine would be born with any major disabilities. That\u2019s really tough to talk about, but I know introspectively that I would not be a suitable caregiver. It would be the hardest decision of my life, but I know I would have to make that choice for myself and the child in question.\n\nOn the other hand, I have had many wonderful experiences with autistic and DS children. They can be the sweetest, purest children and adults. I\u2019ve also had some pretty terrible experiences with disabled children/adults who were violent, angry and out of control. I was able to see how much stress this put on the parents, and I wouldn\u2019t wish that life on *anybody* - especially those that do not have the capabilities to deal with it.\n\nAnd yet again, on another hand, I have some pretty firm beliefs in eradicating these kinds of health issues in humans (I say \u201cfirm beliefs\u201d even though I\u2019m not 100% sure how I feel, but my gut instinct tells me I feel this way). While studying anatomy and pathophysiology for my nursing program, it\u2019s *really* opened my eyes to just how ugly healthcare can be. Handicapped children and adults are expensive, and usually have a myriad of health issues - some of which can\u2019t be cured, and sometimes can\u2019t be controlled. At the same time, I\u2019m extremely empathetic and if *my* genes were messed up, would I even be here? It\u2019s hard to imagine all those handicapped children just *not being*.\n\nI would never force my decisions on another person, but I just know myself well enough to know that I *could not* be that parent.\n\nThis is something I\u2019ve always been afraid to ask - but is it not a bit selfish either way?\n\nIt\u2019s selfish to keep the child, because autism and DS are spectrum disorders, and it\u2019s hard to tell the severity of the disorders in utero. It\u2019s selfish to subject a child to, possibly, a terrible life filled with judgement, mistreatment and a myriad of different health issues. it\u2019s selfish to not care about the terrible experiences that child might have, just to make yourself feel better and to have the joy of a child. is it really in their best interest - or is it yours?\n\nIt\u2019s also selfish to deny someone life, when they could be completely functional and contributing members of society who *barely* suffer from their afflictions.\n\nThis is a seriously touchy subject, and I think most people are pretty divided in their own feelings.",

When I had dinners over at their house the healthy sisters of the boys had to take care of the child mostly and a nanny specialist that is also very expensive.

The child's mother had sole custody and my stepdad is clearly intimidated by her. The mom did not make sure the child got therapy or any sort of enrichment to try and help her learn basic life skills, so she doesnt know shit and just repeats what everyone says all the time. Stepdad didnt do much of anything about this because the mom would not allow him visitation is he protested anything...so he didnt. \n\nThey have her on medication because she has tantrums and is extremely strong. She wets the bed, she scribbles on walls, she bites kids at school, etc. The school called them in and told them that she does not retain anything they teach her and ive found that to be mostly true from my own interactions with her trying to teach her basic life skills. My stepdad seems to be in over his head, he is also in denial and says that his daughter is just autistic. A doctor told him that she mentally handicapped, he was extremely upset about this \"revelation\". Shes 17....hes been in denial this whole time. \n\nNot long after he got custody (and found out she is not autistic), he started drinking and staying in his bedroom, I think he is very overwhelmed with his daughter and its become apparent that he wants out. Shes about to be 18 and he has no interest in being her guardian. I think that means she will become someone else's problem, I'm not sure how that works. My mom is tired of living with the both of them and wants a divorce.  They have been married for almost 10 years. \n\nSo yeah, I dont give a shit about the pro-life argument here.

He said he\u2019d be there for us, or course, but he went much further into trying to \u201cconvince\u201d us not to go through with it.

            "Sorry for long post-\n\nI\u2019ve spent years trying to remove subconscious sexist/racist feelings from my mind. We all have issues with unconscious biases to some extent, and No one is free from society instilling you with certain values. I just try to check myself when these thoughts come up and think about why I feel this way so I can realize how irrational the thought is.\n\nSo anyway, when I read this, I got a visceral pang of disgust and revulsion  towards this girl. This surprised me as I usually don\u2019t feel this way towards similar stories, and it immediately disgusted me that my brain reacted that way. So then I asked myself, what specifically am I thinking about that\u2019s giving me this feeling? And that\u2019s the thing- there wasn\u2019t anything deeper there, just a nameless uncomfortable feeling that a girl of that age doing such a thing is repulsive.\n\nI was raised in a pretty conservative household, and teenage sex was heavily discouraged for us to do, and painted as heavily shameful when my folks heard of other teens doing it. Some of this may also just be due to growing up in the American suburbs where I did during the 90s. Not that any of this is an excuse. \n\nMy point is that sometimes we get caught up in these kinds of belief systems and it can take years and years of mindfulness to scrub these entrenched values from yourself, more than your average idiot on reddit is ever going to do. This post is not to defend them in any way, but to remind everyone that we need to make broad changes to how we think about a lot of things in society as a whole.

        "selftext": "***Multi-part disclaimer***: This drama is still very much active and I have been updating the drama as it goes along. While this is a long read, it's well worth the time to fully grasp the entire concept of what's going on. Once done, see the active drama edits at the bottom for the latest updates. \n\nFor context: Adam the Woo is one of YouTube's original travel vloggers. He left home around ten years ago, began living in a van, and traveled the country's highways and by-ways to find interesting roadside locations that wouldn't ordinarily be featured or may not be as recognized. For a long time, Adam has ran two YouTube channels: his primary [AdamtheWoo](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8VpMkDsn6QrXqhsbxMiQZg), which is the larger of the two and features a more edited, focused, and researched presentation that more closely mirrors video essays, rather than vlogs. This channel has not been updated since 2017. Adam also has his second channel, [TheDailyWoo](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsVZh7ixefe7v0wlIkhfk9g), which acts as his day-to-day vlogging channel and is updated quite frequently.\n\nAdam has also been a bit of a loner during his time in the public eye. He has had girlfriends and has introduced his family at points, but for the vast majority of the past ten years, he's relatively stayed by himself, save for the infrequent encounters he may have with friends, other vloggers or what have you. All that to say, seeing him now with someone who he is, seemingly, with is nice for most of his fans, as he's talked about wanting to retire within the coming years and have a family at some point, but has never gone through with it or made it a primary focus onscreen. \n\nSo the start of the drama started four days ago when Adam uploaded a video of himself and his new, seeming, girlfriend at Disney's Magic Kingdom in Orlando. Ordinarily, when these videos are uploaded to the subreddit, they generally consist of one to three comments, at most. [This one](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adamthewoo/comments/m96rnw/spring_break_is_busy_at_disney_world_magic/) has 36, so off the bat you can tell that this isn't an ordinary upload. \n\nFrom the jump, we see the one man war machine (hereby referred to as such) and one of their first war-mongering comments [complaining about the age difference between Adam and his girlfriend, Natalie](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adamthewoo/comments/m96rnw/spring_break_is_busy_at_disney_world_magic/groiepe/). Before going on, there are three points of interest here: \n\n* Adam is in his mid-40's and Natalie is assumed to be in her 20's, though no one knows for sure and the age keeps changing, thread by thread. \n\n* Natalie has been mentioned and seen in Adam's videos before as he gave her a ride cross-country as part of a sightseeing tour across the country. He\u2019s done these types of trips numerous times, sometimes with other people, so this is nothing out of the ordinary for him. \n\n* According to the one man war machine, it has been discovered that Natalie goes by Daphne Del Rey, has done porn, and has an OnlyFans account, as mentioned [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adamthewoo/comments/m96rnw/spring_break_is_busy_at_disney_world_magic/grqqpm3/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adamthewoo/comments/m96rnw/spring_break_is_busy_at_disney_world_magic/groiik7/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adamthewoo/comments/m96rnw/spring_break_is_busy_at_disney_world_magic/grqrmo4/).\n\nAnyways, in this post, it is pointed out that this is ***basically*** [a Chris D'elia situation](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adamthewoo/comments/m96rnw/spring_break_is_busy_at_disney_world_magic/groibbl/), though no one knows for sure the age of Natalie. It's speculated she could be 18, possibly 22, perhaps 29. Somewhere within the 11 year span. \n\nThat caps day one.\n\nThe next day, Adam uploads another video of he and Natalie at Disney's Hollywood Studios. Again, the post receives 31 comments and the flame war breaks out in earnest. [When it is pointed out that Natalie is in her 20's, the war machine arrives](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adamthewoo/comments/m9wdvn/spring_break_2021_at_disneys_hollywood_studios/grpyde8/), and continues fighting the fight, [even when pleas for the cessation of cancelling over baseless rumors are ignored](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adamthewoo/comments/m9wdvn/spring_break_2021_at_disneys_hollywood_studios/grpz7cl/). Soon after, a Funko fan weighs in, questioning whether we should [fear for the safety of the child](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adamthewoo/comments/m9wdvn/spring_break_2021_at_disneys_hollywood_studios/grp6hiz/). There's also a deleted comment here that I cannot find and does not appear on Removeddit, so if anyone can grab that, let me know. \n\nSo that ends day two. \n\nDay three begins with a video of Adam and Natalie at Disney's Animal Kingdom. This blows up to pass 50 comments, something otherwise unheard of on this small subreddit. Now things are spicing up. The war machine arrives, [now claiming Adam is grooming a 17 year old](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adamthewoo/comments/man2pb/wild_day_at_disneys_animal_kingdom_lost_my/grutfvk/) and that the rumors that they (the war machine) are a bad-faith actor, shit-stirrer and an otherwise troll are untrue and made up. \n\nAnd then the bomb drops. This same person also casually mentions that they worked some shows Adam performed in when he was with the band Guttermouth, claiming [they worked 17 tours, and he is not the person he pretends he is](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adamthewoo/comments/man2pb/wild_day_at_disneys_animal_kingdom_lost_my/grutybo/). This information seems to be accepted, as the comment is upvoted and a few people chime in with some somewhat skeptical, somewhat believing replies. This assertion is apparently taken at face value and has not, as of writing this, been argued. \n\nHowever, the goodwill seems short-lived, as there are more [comments insisting on grooming](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adamthewoo/comments/man2pb/wild_day_at_disneys_animal_kingdom_lost_my/grut2hw/), with a strange diversion where our internet sleuth determines that Natalie is lying about her age because of her [Twitter profile picture](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adamthewoo/comments/man2pb/wild_day_at_disneys_animal_kingdom_lost_my/grxo60s/). Further down, there's another comment about [Natalie being Daphne Del Rey](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adamthewoo/comments/man2pb/wild_day_at_disneys_animal_kingdom_lost_my/gruuteh/), and that sees the end of this thread.\n\nDawn of the fourth day.\n\nAdam uploads a video of himself and Natalie going to the opening of the newest Buc-ee's convenience store in Daytona Beach. The post reaches 82 comments.\n\n[The war](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adamthewoo/comments/mbee88/grand_opening_of_bucees_in_daytona_beach_florida/gry8nmj/)...\n\n[reaches](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adamthewoo/comments/mbee88/grand_opening_of_bucees_in_daytona_beach_florida/grxll9a/)...\n\n[a](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adamthewoo/comments/mbee88/grand_opening_of_bucees_in_daytona_beach_florida/grxh6m7/)...\n\n[fever](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adamthewoo/comments/mbee88/grand_opening_of_bucees_in_daytona_beach_florida/gryhkvq/) (this one is probably the war machine's alt)...\n\n[pitch](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adamthewoo/comments/mbee88/grand_opening_of_bucees_in_daytona_beach_florida/grxon1z/).\n\nThe war machine has picked up steam and is now actively searching for blood. [They attack Adam for talking to Ron Desantis](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adamthewoo/comments/mbee88/grand_opening_of_bucees_in_daytona_beach_florida/grzjszr/), [they attack another commenter for never being shown the history of their family, I think](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adamthewoo/comments/mbee88/grand_opening_of_bucees_in_daytona_beach_florida/grxt354/), [they attack both Adam for featuring Natalie in the YouTube thumbnail, then suggests Natalie is a prostitute](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adamthewoo/comments/mbee88/grand_opening_of_bucees_in_daytona_beach_florida/grxpu3g/), [they attack Natalie for seemingly being in a throat fuck video](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adamthewoo/comments/mbee88/grand_opening_of_bucees_in_daytona_beach_florida/grz654o/). It all goes to shit in a goddamn hurry. \n\nSeemingly out of nowhere, [another account mysteriously agrees with the war machine account](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adamthewoo/comments/mbee88/grand_opening_of_bucees_in_daytona_beach_florida/grxlufn/), though this is believed to a be an alt. This one also hosts discussions of whether a gay man can have a daughter, so there's that. \n\nAll of this culminates in the great final battle, as the war machine pens their own magnum opus: [Adam The Woo's new friend](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adamthewoo/comments/maymx6/adam_the_woos_new_friend/). I won't link individual comments because the entire thread is littered with drama. The war machine wages war on everyone. Any distractor, any deserter, anyone who says otherwise is met with unyielding opposition. \n\nAnd so it was...\n\nEpilogue.\n\n[Natalie has tweeted her response to the matter](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adamthewoo/comments/mbuom4/recent_tweet_from_natalie_is_this_confirmation_of/). The war machine stays silent. His deed is done.\n\nActually, I lied. The war machine rages on. [Adam has uploaded a new video today, featuring the filming locations of the movie *The Florida Project*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adamthewoo/comments/mc5brb/the_florida_project_2017_filming_locations_tour/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf). The war machine has now threatened to take down Adam... once he unlocks the comments.\n\n**Active drama edit 1**: u/Andres9924 found something interesting. Daphne/Nicole tweeted in the last hour [that she was still getting harassed by her ex](https://twitter.com/1niteinpari5/status/1374836882442452992?s=20) who, apparently, is 42 and a father. This is in no way accusatory, but it\u2019s interesting that suddenly this is happening to her and she tweets that thinly veiled tweet. Again, this isn\u2019t an accusation, but it is rather noteworthy. \n\n**Active drama edit 2**: Good evening folks. This one just came across the news desk here. It would seem that the drama is still going on and it is moving quick so buckle in. The hero of our story, the infamous \"war machine\", is now attempting some light-hearted fun, [posting a \"Adam the Woo memes thread\u201d](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adamthewoo/comments/mcgp5b/adam_the_woo_memes_thread/) to the subreddit. Whether or not this is light-hearted fun, trolling, or more mean-spiritedness is yet to be determined. Similarly, there was another post added to the subreddit, [now since deleted](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adamthewoo/comments/mcfg3s/im_done_with_utvs_fred_savage_hes_blocked/), containing what could have been a possible doxxing attempt. Again, this is unconfirmed and unsubstantiated, but there definitely seems to be more drama happening as we speak. Finally, it would also seem that the war machine account has invaded this very post, as they are still in here looking for blood from SRD users. Be on the lookout, because not only are they here, they've invited friends, or possibly alt accounts and they seem to be spreading some very odd and probably untrue rumors about Adam and other YouTubers. \n\nI'll update again, if necessary.\n\n**Active drama edit 3**: It\u2019s here. The end times are nigh. The war machine has linked a video to r/AdamTheWoo titled [The Adam the Woo Grooming Allegations](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=StktCB5XpFc&amp;amp;amp;amp;feature=youtu.be), which is set to premiere tomorrow afternoon. This also proves they\u2019re using at least one alt account, as the YouTube account releasing this video is named the same as one of the accused accounts: Dewmonic Abyss. Also, based on the thumbnail, this post will be featured as will some comments so stay tuned to see if you become YouTube famous.\n\n**Active drama edit 4**: Shoutout to u/trees91 for creating and sending me this post, titled [All The Same User: TVs_Fred_Savage, AffectionateFoot9477, Throwra10514, Delta757Fan](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adamthewoo/comments/mctmq0/all_the_same_user_tvs_fred_savage/). Judging by the post, the war machine account does seem to be using at least three alt accounts to go after people. In that same vein, another post sprouted up on the subreddit: [Last time I was here this place was dead. What happened? lol](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adamthewoo/comments/mcozsw/last_time_i_was_here_this_place_was_dead_what/). This is also assumed to be a war machine alt account as the account was created eight hours ago, as I write this. There's not a ton of drama in this post, but there are some comments quick to call out the supposed use of alts. There was another post on the subreddit [I think we all know who's twitter this is](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adamthewoo/comments/mcmyrg/i_think_we_all_know_whos_twitter_this_is/) that seems to be an attack on either the war machine or someone else, it's not definite. Lastly, and possibly most importantly, we've finally gotten word from the lone active moderator on the subreddit. /u/cocksherpa2 had [this to say about everything going on in the \"chat thread\" on the subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adamthewoo/comments/lu97po/chat_thread/gs33otu/). Anyways, that's all that has happened overnight.\n\n**Active drama edit 5**: So the fun is starting to decrease. It would seem that the war machine account has become aware of their small cult following and/or celebrity and is posting Adam's content with a super edgy comment about the two \"fucking in a kids themed hotel.\" You can look [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adamthewoo/comments/mcx91z/comments_off_theyre_at_a_hotel/), but the it's not as fun anymore.

He was not sleeping in the van as he would always pretend as you will never see any bedding and only his bass guitar. Adam didn't travel with the rest of us. He would say he needed to record his internet show then leave without helping break down gear then go get his own hotel room. Next day he would always show up late avoiding set up. He refused to do things such as help sell merch. He was always about to go film. There's a reason the band Guttermouth has never spoken highly of Adam or even about him. He says they are all friends still but I can attest they definitely are not. Mark has always stated that Adam owes the band still for certain expenses he occurred.\n\nseems like a nothingburger, right? He had a few beers and smoked some pot when he claimed he had none but was a shitty bandmate too. Or am I missing something?",

The Eternals thing is a shitty cash grab, but at least you can just ignore it if you don't like it. However, the state that the League client is in is absolutely laughable. Given the high number of employees working for Riot, it's inexcusable that the client has been as bug-infested as it has been for the last 5 (!) years. \n\nReading patch notes and seeing cash grabs be implemented instead of a bug fix for your favorite champion must feel disappointing as well.",

Hell, the term \"Whale\" in itself is from the game industry to describe people who spend thousands on a game and are specifically targeted to be charged as much as possible.\n\nDoesn't League already have micro-transactions for cosmetic skins, buying all the champions and the like?

ADCs are more relavant at least but the Jungle has a ways to go for balance purposes.\n\nI don't like the idea of the new mastery system, but just because they've been working on it for \"six months\" doesn't mean that every Riot employee has worked on it. We get patches every two weeks, some big some small, that go a long way to bring life back into some under used champs.\n\nWith that said, the skill ceiling of every character and every fundamental skill means that despite how underpowered your main champion might be, a good player can make it work.

So let's jump into the drama. \n\nWe'll start with the announcement post itself:\n\n**THREAD #1: [PCM Rules Announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/vy8174/comment/ig11ojr/)**\n\nA few users  ask the tough questions, and are not satisfied with the answers:\n\n>If I post a meme [depicting someone being put up against the wall](https://i.imgur.com/NXR1QA9.png), will I be permabanned?\n>>I think all of the images and questions you showed should be good. the \"depicting someone being put up against the wall\" is a bit edgy but I think falls within whats allowed.\n>>>What?

No matter how hard you struggle to meet admin demands, this sub is toast and so goes any authority you have on reddit with it. So bend that knee, it will give you at least another 3 to 4 months.\n>>[and thats 3-4 months of funny memes.

If we can course correct and reduce the amount of rule breaking material we will survive](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/vy8174/comment/ig1p0rs/?context=3)\n\n**THREAD #2: [Right quadrants react to PCM getting terminated](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/vygl50/right_quadrants_react_to_pcm_getting_terminated/)**\n\n>We do not kneel\n>>[cringe](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/vygl50/comment/ig24ofp/?context=9)\n\n-\n\n>We're crashing this sub with no survivors\n>>[I know you are.

Someone [posts a big wall of text that's kind of in meme form, which contains my favorite quote from the entire drama so far:.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/vyji6t/not_really_a_meme_but_a_rant_i_needed_to_get_out/) \n\n>We see people dividing into camps again, blaming fingers, with others putting fuel to the fire. The situation with the sub is merely a microcosm of what is happening everywhere else. We created a society that has a chance at being better, but we rejected it because it wasn't perfect.\n\n2.

CTH, by my memory at least (I admit I could be misremembering) was eventually shut down because of a much more vague \"threatening violence\" situation. Most of the violent language was either obviously in jest or had way more context than it appeared at a glance, but it did still happen often enough (old time CTH users may not remember/admit it but there's a very clear difference between \"John Brown was morally correct to kill slaveowners\" and \"liberals get the bullet too\"). And there was a legitimate worry that the clause about ban evasion subs would be interpreted super loosely since CTH became kind of a general leftist hangout spot instead of something specific, so theoretically *any* new leftist sub could be axed immediately. That didn't happen, but it *was* a concern. Regardless, the last few days when it was apparent that the ban was inevitable, the sub was flooded with heartfelt goodbyes and thank yous to the friends people made, the help they were given, and for the space to openly be themselves without being immediately judged with suspicion (read: trans folks were completely safe and surrounded by likeminded people who truly wanted to make their lives better). The vibe was very much \"It's been an honor shitposting with y'all\" as the sub went down in a blaze of glory. \n\nPCM, on the other hand, is specifically told to stop using slurs and quit playing coy about the most obvious fascist/white supremacist dogwhistles in the universe and it's been nothing but indignant salt, crocodile tears, and willful obtuseness non stop for a full day. \n\nAnybody who still seriously thinks that the left is the \"emotional\" wing of the political spectrum at this point is either a liar or the most useful idiot on the planet.",

And with the sub's premise of treating all political sides as equal, those people soon outnumbered everyone else since their vitriol could be written off as \"just another opinion.\n\nThese new rules were probably a long time coming, so to see such a strong response to enforcing basic decency tells you all you need to know about the state of that sub.",

I remember refreshing /b/ all afternoon with the hope that someone would make a new meme. I was a memer back when Advice Dog was the only one and I still upvote every Advice Dog meme I see becasue of the fond rush of nostalgia it brings me. Nowadays, there are many thousand on quickmeme and other meme websites. I was a memer back before memegenerator was created (the first meme website) and I had to make them with MS Powerpoint or Paint. Speaking of meme websites, I was one of the first submitters to memebase.com and still have one of the top accounts there despite having migrated to reddit nearly 2 years ago. It was on 4chan and memebase where I cut my teeth creating memes, way before I had a reddit account and way before /r/adviceanimals was created in late 2010. Back before I could get any sort of points or even username recognition, I was creating memes as a clever and easily digestible way to reflect on society, relate some story to my audience, or just be funny.\nDo you remember rich raven? No? I do. You probably don't remember depression dog, crazy girlfriend praying mantis, introspective pug, or friendzone Johnny either. I remember all of them.

            "A lot of people say \"Is it just me\" as a sort of rhetorical device, but I think I have a real case here. When it comes to the topic of Russian interference, the typical consensus is that they want to split up some nation, or that they are manufacturing societal divides in some nation.\n\nIs it just me who sees the total acceptance of that perspective about Russian cybersocialwarfare as being part of the cybersocial warfare?\n\nThere is only one kind of party that emphasizes unity over personal morals: conservative ones. \n\nThe Kremlin only has to keep the fear in the West as high as possible, and soon enough, enough progressives will bend the knee, whether voluntarily, or the conservative population will be riled up enough to apply violence to progressive elements who will be denounced as \"Russian shills\" trying to split the country. \n\nI saw a conversation in the linked post that was exactly that. Someone said that ([implied] progressive) Americans should stop being so eager to call other Americans \"Nazis\", then someone linked an article about how there *are* Nazis in the US, and then that person was derided with comments like \"shoo, shoo\" and stuff. I cannot find the conversation anymore, I really wished I saved it, but there wasn't enough meat in the conversation for me to link it to CB2 or whatever.\n\nFor reasons I cannot discern, people are being deluded that Russian does not want strong right-wing governments to take hold. Perhaps they do not understand that one half of the essence of authoritarianism is submission. It is inextricably linked with \"might makes right\". A strong right wing government is just a strong zombie. Should the leader get any funny ideas about turning on Mother Russia, an underling will be more than glad to turn him in to grab the title for himself. Should an underling get any funny ideas about turning on Mother Russia, they will be quickly, publicly made an example of, for the local leader's personal benefit which they receive for helping our Glorious Russian Liberators root out traitors.",

That being said, KPOP is diametrically opposed to punk. There is literally no genre of music more corporate, or more contrived than KPOP ( if you are a fan, that's fine, but you know it's true). So this is degrees further than a Kardasian wearing a tee shirt with a glittery Misfits logo on it. When Sid Vicious wears a shirt with a swastika on it, it's about shock. When a KPOP star wears a shirt with a swastika on it it's nothing but bad taste and offensive. Because a KPOP star was never authentic to begin with."

Disc golf is free to play (in most places) and open to anyone. That makes me think it is more a representation of the area and not the sport? I live in a college town in a midwest state so have seen a fairly diverse groups out on the course, both diverse in race and gender and in perceived political ideas. My experience the majority people I've met and am friends with through disc golf are or seem to be progressive, but there is nothing stopping bigots from also playing a game at a public park. Best we can do is call out any bigotry or discrimination when we see it, vote with our wallets, and continue to work to grow the sport by encouraging all people to go and throw some discs.",

The culprit is always miscommunication and individuals having their own pow and thus not realizing the full extent of what is happening.\n\nThere are plenty of more plausible explainations than just \"travis scott, the cameraman, the orgqnizers and the jenners are part of a death cult\". For starters people don't seem to realize things like the fact that the artists can't really see well the crowd due to lights being pointed directly at them, or that the cameramen wear ear protection and know that at a concert like that people will try to climb up the camera platforms. Or again, that the artists CAN stop the concert but they expect the organizers to cut the music if something bad is going on, so you get stuck in a situation where both parties are sitting there like \"do i stop it or do i wait for them to tell me to\". Again, those are behavioral patterns that can be seen in most large scale incidents, from Fukushima to the Challenger passing by the Heysel. \n\nI'm not defending any of the people involved because there definitely is individual fault, but the main issue is the combibation of relatively small mistakes.

There was no way he didn\u2019t notice, people were chanting \u201clet us leave\u201d at him in the first row just feet away from him. It should\u2019ve ended but instead he kept it going and even brought out more people like drake to get people even more hyped up and even more smooshing happened. Travis has a history with this behavior that he even displayed in his own movie. Perhaps the crowd would\u2019ve had more space if so many people weren\u2019t breaking in to the show- which he encouraged people to do in a now deleted tweet.",

            "Just a correction - the dress said \"tax the rich\", not \"eat the rich\". I know it's a minute Detail that normally wouldn't mean much, but in this case one is a major talking point on policy for her party and the other is just a catchy phrase. \n\nOn topic though, I saw a few posts about this yesterday and it really sparked a lot of controversial comments. It was entertaining. \n\nYesterday I learned that an annual income of approx 174k is \"rich\".\n\nEdit: there's been a lot of discussion around what is considered rich. In relation to my comment, I use cost of living as a metric, not average wages. Firstly, the perception of wage average has skewed the perception of what is rich. Given cost of living in most areas, what is considered middle class is barely above the poverty line. In the case of AOC, a some have pointed out, her cost of living is higher given the expectations of her position. \n\nIdeally, middle class would be around the 100k range (give or take 20k). Given that, while 200k would be higher tier upper class, it's hardly bordering on the \"rich elite\" status that a comment like \"tax the rich\" is aimed at. \n\nThese income values are all before tax.",

Yes, excess without moderation isn't good, but also, this is a decades old event *intended* to be over-the-top to bring in money for one of the biggest, best, and **most publically accessible** art museums in the world.\n\nFFS, the reason the Fyre Festival failed is exactly because the brains behind it were Reddit bros who didn't understand that you can't *buy* culture, anyway. It happens because groups of people come together for a common purpose. Even if - or sometimes especially if - that purpose makes little sense later (looking at you, Burning Man); you can't just *will* it into existence without huge effort, and usually very little return on your investment. That's why the biggest events are usually charitible events or awards shows or other things where the talent has motives other than money for showing up.\n\nAnd *THAT'S* why the designer offered to pay for AOCs ticket and provide her with the gown if she would go, and why she agreed to do it; because we are ALL *still* talking about ALL of it, and also....\n\n....TAX THE RICH - paying your fair share should *NOT* be a controversial statement in the year 2021.",

        "selftext": "**If at any point you get lost, overwhelmed or confused with the story please see the TL;DR at the bottom for a clearer picture.**\n\nFirstly, for context CivDiv is a trained soldier who wears a GoPro during his military postings and then edits and sometimes narrates them via text before sharing on youtube for his decently large (for the genre) audience.\n \nRecently he was fighting [**EDIT: My mistake, it is not CivDiv filming these videos but another soldier, who gave CivDiv the footage to use on his channel.**.] for the Ukrainian Army in Ukraine as a member of their foreign legion, and from this posting he recently posted 3 videos, all 3 of which recieved large amounts of interest from [r/combatfootage](https://www.reddit.com/r/combatfootage).  The first is called [Combat GoPro - Recon into Russian Position](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzfgEVwsyOQ) while the second video in the series is [Combat GoPro - Accidentally Fragging Russian Spetsnaz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOiGJSf5RPE) and finally, things come to a crescendo in the video  [Combat GoPro - Wiping Out Russian Spetsnaz Team in CQB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQeyk1BQ7LE) which is the video referenced in the [primary reddit thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineWarVideoReport/comments/10oksgm/combat_gopro_wiping_out_russian_spetsnaz_team_in/) where all this drama happens.\n\nNow, all these videos i believe are valuable documentations of current geopolitical events however they are quite lengthy and involved so to summarise things down to a more palatable size, essentially the videos follow a unit of Foreign Legion fighters - international fighters who have travelled to Ukraine to fight for Ukraine alongside Ukrainians. In these videos they encounter a Russian BMP (Armored troop carrier with a big gun, but not quite a full tank) which is filled with Russian Spetsnaz (special forces) soldiers. One of them hits the BMP with an NLAW (An antitank rocket fired by infantry) which causes an immobility kill on the BMP (stops it from moving.) This causes the soldiers inside to bail out and move into one of the houses in the surrounding area. The foreign legion fighters then must move through the area searching houses as they go in order to find and flush out these soldiers. \n\nIn the final video we see the squad approach a house that has been seen in previous videos also. As they enter the dwelling, the 'Point man' (first soldier into the house) is shot and wounded and the rest of the team posts up outside, shooting and throwing grenades into the house. Finally they clear the house and the video explains that the entire squad of russian special forces were killed inside the house. Unfortunately however the GoPro with which they are filming suddenly stops recording, and when it returns there is text over the video explaining that the housewas succesfully cleared without incident however just as they were moving out, an artillery shell landed directly outside the building, killing two of their team including an Irishman called Rory (the first Irish casualty in Ukraine i believe.) and wounding numerous others. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n**Now, the controversy:**\n\nAt first redditors took CivDiv's claims at face value and lamented the loss of those killed and wounded by the 'artillery strike' which occured off-camera, as evidenced by the [top comment here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/10ofg7d/civ_div_combat_gopro_wiping_out_russian_spetsnaz/j6eb8r4/) Soon however a user comments that [I guess the rumored negotiation was edited out if it was true. Probably thats why the gopro \"turned off\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/10ofg7d/civ_div_combat_gopro_wiping_out_russian_spetsnaz/j6ediw6/) and users begin to question the official narrative. \nNow, seperate to CivDiv and his youtube videos, about 3 months ago (right after this actual mission took place) a finnish board similar to 4chan was the site of an [interesting discussion in Finnish](https://ylilauta.org/satunnainen/130675536#192771886) - \n\nThis post is then summarised by another Foreign Legion fighter called 'Eyugenero' who was NOT present on this operation but who WAS in ukraine with many of the people from the video - and is translated by redditor hollowpo1nt [in this excellent comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/10ofg7d/civ_div_combat_gopro_wiping_out_russian_spetsnaz/j6f73q1/) which is quickly gilded and upvoted en masse as redditors begin to piece things together. \n\n>all the other guys went on a mission but the platoon leader [the platoon consists of atleast 2 different squads] tells me not to go because my helmet and plate carrier got burned in a fire just before [BMP shot their car with all their gear in it]\n\n\n>before leaving the guys come and tell us that we [the other finn volunteer who got wounded by the BMP] did \"really fucking well\" and saved all our asses from that BMP yesterday\n\n\n>apparently it bugged off when my buddy opened up on it with the Kord [.50 cal heavy machine gun]\n\n\n>apparently it then returned later and lit up our firing positions after we'd moved on from there\n\n\n>the american's squad thought we'd gotten \"lit the fuck up\" and killed when they saw the 30mm [BMP autocannon] blasting the intersection\n\n\n>one dude is in an unusually good mood and reminds us that you can always get your stuff back, but not your life\n\n\n>my squad leader tells me \"well see again\" and the squad leaves to go on the mission\n\n\n>spend the day depressed and smoking in an environment reminiscent of Metro 2033\n\n\n>the guys come back in the evening\n\n\n>ask the finnish medic with my squad how it went\n\n\n>\"anon is dead\" he answers [Rory Mason, I assume, their Irish squad leader] \n\n\n>...\n\n\n>\"okay well take your time and come over and tell me what happened\"\n\n\n\nWell...\n\n\n\n>the guys were in a firefight with some Spetznaz who had barricaded themselves in the house\n\n\n>my squad leader tried to talk them into surrendering on the edge of the house for about 30 minutes\n\n\n>at the end some Russian came out with his hands up and no gun\n\n\n>the american's squad leader shot him right in the head\n\n\n>the spetznaz realise they have no escape route, start fighting to the death\n\n\n>my squad leader tries to get out of the house\n\n\n>russians shoots him between the plates in the side\n\n\n>my squad leader dies at the hands of the finnish medic minutes later while they're still fighting\n\n\n>final words \"im dying\" and pupils shrink and lips turn pale\n\n\n>after the american's squad leader shot the russian dude, the finnish medic immediately asks the american's squad leader why he did it\n\n\n>\"fuck that guy\" answers the american's squad leader\n\n\n\n>in the morning a guy in a good mood tried to go and \"do some CQB\" in that house\n\n\n>got shot in the head with a hole in the back of the head the size of a fist\n\n\n>didn't die, apparently even obeyed simple orders\n\n\n> while evacuating fell down from the ATV when the guys didn't tie him up properly\n\n\n>is now on a ventilator in the hospital\n\n\n\nWe were just in the same hospital with him. Apparently his family is on their way here to pull the plug. Some people went to say hello to him but we didn't feel like going to see him.\n\n\n\nDuring the battle, the following happened\n\n\n\n>about the entire american squad was wounded in the firefight. One was missing half his jaw. You don't really miss these guys because they were pretty arrogant and didn't participate in the basic chores. They just injected testosterone and went nuts. The ones who weren't wounded cancelled their contracts immediately because they didn't want to die for us\n\n\n\n>a thermobaric rocket was fired into the building with some weird rocket launcher.\n\n\n\n>this one alpha dude fucked up with an f1 grenade, bounced off the wall, guy picks it up off the ground again and throws it through the window 0.5 sec before it exploded\n\n\n>same guy took a bullet in the middle of the vest the day before\n\n\n>american guy wounded in the neck, ran away from the medic at least twice\n\n\n\n\n>brazilian rpg-hero shot 5 rockets without hearing protection, couldn't hear a thing in the evening\n\n\n\n>the last Russian was the toughest, wounded 6 guys until someone killed him\n\n\n\n\nso these russians had molle pockets and ak12s and surprisingly cool clothes on. The fattest was an officer. But they didn't have proper tourniquets or optics, for example.\n\n\n\n\n>platoon leader was totally shit, got locked up in the situation and american squad leader took control of the situation\n\n\n\n>platoon leaders hands were shaking the rest of the night, blames himself for how fucked it all turned out in the end\n\n\n\n>decides that the best way to show respect to a fallen guy is to go to work the next day and do your best.\n\n\n>platoon leader left \"on sick leave\" the next day, I took his helmet and one of the american guys' vests for my own use\n\n\nHollowpo1nt then goes on to explain that the writer 'Eyugenero' is also the guy filming [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWlk_OHJQ3Q&t=500s) and that [this](https://twitter.com/Eyugenero) is his twitter account, where he also accuses the american's squad leader seen in an earlier civ div video of shooting the surrendering russian and getting one of his close friends, an Irishman named Rory Mason, Killed. [link to that tweet here](https://twitter.com/Eyugenero/status/1613641111150501890)\n\nThis Finnish foreign legion fighter known as 'Eyugenero' (who again was present in Ukraine but NOT present during this operation) claims that the American soldier that allegedly shot the surrendering Russian in the head can be seen on an [earlier civ div video at 7:22](https://youtu.be/Rpx7TWc58PI?t=442)\n\nThen he posts a clarification on 4chan /k/ board, [located here](https://boards.4channel.org/k/thread/56952631#p56954426) \n in which he clarifies the timeline and also re-iterates that no war crime was committed. \n\nFinally, somebody on 4chan leaks drone footage of the building seemingly right after CivDiv's GoPro 'suddenly stops recording'. These clips can be found [here](https://i.4cdn.org/k/1675041245057055.webm) and [here](https://i.4cdn.org/k/1675041338451881.webm) and are in my opinion some of the most interesting pieces of evidence inm this whole saga, as they seem (to me anyway) to show that CivDiv's claims that the casualties in his squad were from an artillery shell are false, as they show a deceased russian soldier with red legband laying at the entrance, and a single UA fighter being dragged to safety, with no evidence of artillery obvious at all.\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\n* Youtuber CivDiv posts combat footage video from Ukraine, (filmed 3months ago), showing a foreign legion assault on russian special forces holed up in a building. Video claims that all the Russians are eliminated without issue, but then the Gopro fails - just before artillery shell lands, killing 2 and wounding 5 others in the squad.\n\n* Posts are then found from 3 months prior on Finnish message boards describing what sounds like the same combat mission, however these posts claim instead that the Irish Squad leader Rory Mason was actually trying to organise a surrender with the trapped russians who had sent their leader out unarmed to negotiate with Rory (who was the only one present who spoke russian)\n* During these talks one of the american soldiers is hit in the head/neck and wounded by *something* (although this is not made clear in the earliest posts on the finnish boards)\n* The American soldier shown at 2:30 in the [main video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQeyk1BQ7LE&t=150s) then shoots the unarmed Russian in the head (according to these message board posts)\n* The remaining russian special forces then see/hear their buddy who was trying to negotiate a surrender get shot, and decide to go out fighting instead.\n* most of the russians are promptly killed, but the last remaining russian manages to hit 6 of the americans before being taken out.\n* After these posts are made, drone footage is also leaked (linked just above) which appears to support the claims made by Eyugenero and posted on 4chan / ylilauta\n* Final result is that it appears CivDiv manufactured an entire false narrative about a perfectly placed and timed artillery shell landing in order to cover for the rash actions of an american in ukraine which seemingly led to the death of an Irishman and an American in Ukraine, and the wounding of multiple others.\n\n\nOne last thing, many accounts of this drama miss the clarification post by Eyugenero which says that another american soldier was hit *before* the american man from [2:30] shot the unarmed and surrendering russian in the head. In that situation, cries of \"War Crime!\" could be seen as potentially having merit, however with the clarification update the situation actually becomes a case of perfidy (i believe) whereby the American shooter can be legally justified in his shooting of an unarmed combatant because he obviously perceived that they were under attack and simply acted on this in the heat of the moment.",

            "It\u2019s so hard to tell what happened. Not only do you have the fog of war, but for as long as humans have been waging war, soldiers have been misrepresenting (intentionally or unintentionally) what exactly took place. The innocuous reason is that a soldier\u2019s memory and understanding aren\u2019t always perfect, but you also have ego and other more personal concerns (being second guessed, shamed, or even penalized) motivating soldiers to tell a certain tale. I mean, just consider that recommendations for certain awards require witnesses and that gun cameras are placed on fighter planes as examples. \n\nIn this case, both sides of the debate have motives to lie. The Finnish soldiers may (understandably) be angry about the lives lost and injuries suffered and want to vent that frustration, which could lead to a biased telling of events. On the other side, no one wants to be accused of committing a war crime or recklessly getting his comrades killed in a bungled operation.\n\nI don\u2019t really know where I come out on the debate. I will say that I\u2019m surprised CivDiv and the soldier who took the video would released videos from an operation that went so poorly and painted them the participants in such a negative light because inevitably the bad things would come out. But hey, maybe the reason the guy took the WillyOAM interview was to get out ahead of this story before shit hit the fan. \n\nWe will probably never know for certain, but this highlights the importance of taking everything you see and hear with a grain of salt.",

He seems to be back in Ukraine(As of recent) but has not posted any footage. He used to help fight with the YPG/YBS(Kurdish forces that fight Turkey/ISIS).\n\nGopros have a habit of corrupting everything so it could be edited or really cut. Also, in the failed surrender footage seen in this war, there are 2-3 videos of groups of Russians surrendering and 1 Russian opening fire(Killing 2 Ukrainians in one video or even missing) but it often results in the side that is capturing the surrendering soldiers to open fire on each of them. These previous videos of this happening are also not helpful, as it increases tension further.

The proper way to protest that is for users to stop going to Reddit. If there are a significant amount of third party app users gone then decrease of traffic would hurt Reddit. \n\nThe second is mods saying they need third party apps for moderation. The most effective course of action here would be just stop moderating. If mods require those tools for effective moderating, show the users what the subreddit looks without them. Let the subs get mobbed by porn, onlyfans bots or whatever. Give the users an concrete example of what their favourite subs look like without effective moderation tools.

How he became the self titlted \u201ctop mens reddit creator\u201d with 700k Karma? How the \u201cnew hotwives\u201d who post his name in the title also go to the top spot?\n\n>here you are:\n\n>For the past few years he\u2019s been purchasing \u201cupvote bots\u201d that send his post hundreds of votes at a time, manipulating the reddit algorithm. Reddit doesn\u2019t show how many votes you have to the public within the first two hours so he\u2019ll usually time it with a speed boost to make sure nobody can see that he has in fact purchased bot votes. Just like this post here that I am commenting on. He\u2019s based on the East Coast, and will wake up earlier then everyone in order to ensure there\u2019s little competition to protect his business and main income stream. Usually on Monday mornings and also on Friday Nights on the Hotwife Page so his post \u201csticks\u201d through the weekend since onlyfans creators can\u2019t post on weekends - only amateurs.\n\n>After boosting his own post, he will then purchases \u201cdownvote bots\u201d to target other creators posts to drive them down in the algorithm, while his is simultaneously rising. You can watch this happen in real time everytime he posts !\n\n>He\u2019ll spend anywhere from $20-$100 per post. He justifies the expense because the traffic he gets from going to the top, drives OnlyFans subscribers to his page, builds his notoriety, convinces other couples he\u2019s \u201cin demand\u201d and gives him more of a talent pool to choose from to film with.\n\n>In addition to doing this for himself, he has now expanded his enterprises and is \u201cmanaging\u201d and \u201cworking\u201d only with \u201cnew hotwives and young first timers\u201d. These people are new to reddit and the community and on the naive side. He\u2019ll convince them that he is the number one mens creator on Reddit, and that by working him with and filming exclusively with him, it will grow their OnlyFans pages organically (check his post history on Reddit he brags about it and how he\u2019s going to flood Reddit with it). He\u2019ll ask for a large percentage of their onlyfans income in exchange for being exclusive with him. It\u2019s like modern pimp - except digitally and on Reddit. Red flags all over, as this is \u201ccontrol\u201d \u201cmanipulation\u201d and \u201cexploitation\u201d and then he will go repeat the process with another \u201cnew hotwife\u201d / Here\u2019s how that goes \u2026 He\u2019ll monitor the Hotwife and Cuckold forums, and message the hotwife telling them \u201cit\u2019s a good time to post\u201d and he\u2019ll ask them to make the post from their page, generally what to say, to include his username, and then he will start paying for Reddibt Upvote / Downvote bots - driving them number one. The reason he likes to target new hotwives, is because most of the hotwives in this community who have met with him, are aware of the situation and don\u2019t work with him any longer after this experience. How do I know all of this? My husband and I have wanted to live out this fantasy and we started talking to him over the summer. We met up with him for our first experience and after he aggressively pushed his management services on me saying he wouldn\u2019t release my video if I didn\u2019t move forward with it. I agreed, he made me go viral, started managing my page, and then when I wanted to begin filming with other bulls, he started to get aggressive with my husband. That\u2019s when I discovered he was manipulating the votes on my posts.\n\n>Why does no one say anything? Well, from what I\u2019ve gathered from a few other who He is managing, tried to manage, and from my own anecdotal experience, anytime it\u2019s been addressed, he sends vague threats and messages to wives and their husbands that he will target them he will downvote their posts if they go public. His favorite lines are: \u201che knows people\u201d \u201che\u2019s a fighter\u201d \u201chis upbringing\u201d \u201cwhere he\u2019s from\u201d. Another huge reason is, like he was persistent with me, he is the one filming the video, and retaining the unblurred footage of you and will vaguely suggest that he has something on you - the ultimate leverage - exposing your identity. If he manages you he also access to your Onlyfans page which provides your personal details to him to use against you. He used HungInLA88 as the example of what he\u2019ll do similarly to you if you try to \u201ctest him\u201d. Any other hotwives / couples find it odd that meeting up with him for the first time he talks bout Reddit and HungInLA88 non stop before filming. Pretty unsexy. Not an isolated incident.\n\n>Why am I sharing this? I thought he was genuine and nice but as soon as he turns on you - his real personality comes out. I also feel sick to my stomach that I fell for his stupid management proposals and vote manipulations and the lines he was feeding me. These poor couples and wives are being manipulating by a single man playing on their hopes of internet notoriety and becoming\nhotwife experience and ruining these pages. He\u2019s done this to me, and also multiple people of this community who are afraid to speak up about it out of fear of retribution. If you look at his Twitter, he posts completely different content from on Reddit, working with amateur and professional pornstars and he even talks about in his tweets that Reddit is his top conversion for OnlyFans subscribers, how he blurs his face because its his niche and it makes him more money, and is using deception tactics to milk these pages.\n\n>We are in communication with the moderators as of this morning of various subreddits and they are aware of his upvote / downvote manipulation based on the evidence we provided, the services he\u2019s using and the software tool they can use to test / confirm he is running bots- and they are monitoring him as well as the hotwives he tells to post who are also being boosted and \u201cmanaged\u201d.\n\n>This community needs to purge the toxicity in this community. Manipulation, commercialization, threats, egoism, narcissism.\n\n>If anyone else in the community wants to speak up about this, I urge you to write from a throwaway account for your safety.\n\nhttps://www.reveddit.com/v/Cuckold/comments/11g8ht3/first_time_with_uareallyweakguy_and_he_used_bots/janbv6f/#t1_janbv6f",

Cuckolding is now just a commodity to be shoveled on only fans. Long gone are the days of amateurs sharing experiences and stories of their real lives.

            "I post on /r/wallstreetbets all the time. No one in the sub has ever heard of WSB Coin. You're not even allowed to talk about small stocks and crypto coins because of the risk of a pump and dump like this. You can talk about the major crypto coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum and major NFTs like the Bored Ape ones, but usually people only talk about it in the context of crypto related stocks (e.g., Coinbase quarterly earnings came out an hour or two ago). The people in the sub tend to mock anyone who is invested in crypto coins and meme stocks. Most have gone elsewhere.\n\nBut there are many other places online like Twitter and other subreddits where people use the Wall Street Bets name. No one owns it and anyone can claim they are part of it. It's possible this is a scam on the part of some of the mods. It's possible someone impersonated them. I'm looking forward to the popcorn the same as everyone else.\n\nThat being said, they did give out WSB related Reddit avatars to people for free. I got one. Two people have offered me 0.5 ETH for it at various times, which is theoretically $900. But I have no idea how to sell it, nor do I care. I get the sense that it's like a diamond that seems valuable to people until they actually try to sell it and realize it's a worthless rock. I found it very odd that WSB, which was famously against crypto suddenly was giving them out. Notably, the mods got the dozen or so most valuable ones. I'm not willing to accuse anyone of anything because I have no idea how this industry works, but I'm knowledgeable enough to stay away.\n\nPS: If anyone wants to learn the smart way to invest for your future, go to /r/Bogleheads. Get a brokerage app (I recommend Robinhood, but Vanguard, Fidelity, and Schwab are also good).

So let them replace you. I thought you believed in this thing? I thought you were standing on principle?\n\nIt *was* users & mods against admins, until admins started to threaten to demod the powermods who participated. And suddenly, just like that, it's just users vs. admins.\n\nIn particular, the head mod of /r/unexpected who made a whiny post in /r/ModSupport literally comparing his situation with *slavery,* saying that he's forced to do unpaid labor for reddit now. And like, dude, no one is forcing you to do a single god damned thing. You can just quit. And he had the gall to say \"No, it has to be me, otherwise I'll get replaced by someone who cares less than me\". Just own up to what it's really about: you care more about your reddit position than you care about this protest. But we knew that from day 1, and so did spez. All he had to do was threaten the powermods that they would lose their positions, and immediately they no longer wanted to play pretend revolutionaries.\n\nThis is why the protest was doomed to fail from the start: because it relied on reddit powermods to do the principled thing when push comes to shove. What on earth were you expecting?",
            "I wonder how the mods feel thinking they were doing this for the community they loved, just to watch the community clown on them and get angrier at them than they ever were at Reddit admins.\n\nI still wouldn't be surprised if Reddit replaced them anyways. They showed that they aren't on the same side as Reddit admins. I doubt Reddit admins are going to keep around mods that they think will rebel against them a second time.",

At this point, after everything, and not just everything in the last week but everything in the last 15 years, do you really want to keep working for this platform for free?\n\nTell them to suck and egg and replace you. They can't do it to every mod team at once, and if they do, then leave for Lemmy or kbin or something. There's no point keeping your modships under the admins of this site when they act like this. This is going to get worse. Much worse.",

Fine, but take a page out of /r/pics and let the community go wild.

            "To clarify, admins aren't *forcing* them to do anything. Instead they're saying that an indefinite blackout violates reddit policy under the \"failure to moderate\", an offense that can lead to mods being removed and replaced.\n\nIf you're new here, the \"failure to moderate\" policy is a relatively new one added at the protest of powermods (many of who are involved with the current fiasco), who demanded that reddit silence communities known for \"hate\" and \"misinformation\" - a noble cause for sure - but they were forging a weapon that could be used against them later\n\nI'd personally keep the blackout going until they removed me - I'm a big fan of RIF - but then again I'm not a powermod. I have a career, a family, a few hobbies - plenty of reasons to get up out of bed every morning. But to many powermods, modding is important, and to some, it's all they have.\n\nSo, just like steam and most of the remaining subs, when given a choice between third party apps and their ability to do something that makes them feel good, they will act in their personal best interests and crumble",
            "Wait, noooo, I thought that mod's policy was to continue the blackouts 'till the end, regardless of consequences! \n\nSeems that they don't care for their cause as much as for their trivial powers in their  communities. What a shocker!",
            "Idk how people legitmately expected anyone else, lmfao. This can't even be called a \"\"\"protest\"\"\" - not when the people they're protesting can literally just cancel the protest.\n\nIf people want to actually accomplish anything, they need to nuke their subreddit. Get a bot and delete every single post in their reddit, delete the CSS, delete the automod tools, demod every single person then delete their own reddit acount. Of course, that's *still* going to accomplish absolutely nothing, but at least it would actually affect reddit in some tangible way...",
            "That subreddit's top-listed mod is moderator of **18 subreddits**. At least half of the remaining mods are moderators in 2 or more subreddits. \n\nThe press is already well aware of the ongoing controversy regarding the API changes/charges and and has been covering it all week (NPR) including interviews with Apollo's Selig first, and later, Reddit's Huffman. \n\nOP angling for some kind of shame/call-out is gonna end up with a big, wet, limp, metaphorical noodle. The ire and outrage is legitimately contained among a fairly contained vocal minority. The press coverage (including admin intervention) isn't moving the needle. \n\nThe blackout stunt was poorly considered, a complete flop, and lacked teeth or stakes. The more potent strategy (boycott) is the one that no one wants to undertake. Anything short of a large scale boycott, including account and post history deletion, is worthless. (Awareness has already been achieved as of Monday... And nothing has budged.) \n\nReddit choking out 3P apps and disingenuously refuting accusations to the opposite is problematic. Reddit forcing developing AI technologies to pay-to-play to access Reddit for training (and monetizing the result) SHOULD BE done. But Huffman is throwing the baby out with the bath water by killing 3P apps simply because Reddit wants full control and oversight over the site and it's operations (including ads and revenue generation.)",

They gave them an ultimatum: Open willingly and remain mods, or be removed and replaced with a new mod team.\n\nThe mods bluffed Reddit, and Reddit called that bluff.\n\nDespite the complaints the mods have about the API policy changes making their already thankless job even harder, and for all their bluster about how the site would crumble if the the mods walked away, they caved immediately when faced with the possibility of losing their mod status.\n\nNobody should be surprised that Reddit has begun going down the list of blacked out subs, starting with the biggest, to get them reopened one way or another.

There was speculation that something happened at the time, as she stopped appearing in videos suddenly. However, seems that she was harassed by the community at the time, and has been silent about the situation. Until now.\n\nWarning: Sexual harassment, self mutilation\n\nWith the current drama that started with the Gamer's Nexus video, [Madison has come forward](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinusTechTips/comments/15shoyx/madison_on_her_ltt_experience/) with a series of tweets about her experience as an employee at LTT. The tweets ([direct link to the thread because the reddit post is screenshots](https://twitter.com/suuuoppp/status/1691693740254228741)) are pretty serious, detailing how she was overworked, sexually harassed by several employees (they asked how she f\\*cked, to twerk for another employee, grabbed several times), mistreated by upper management (her work called dogshit, incompetent) and regular employees (called a f\\*gg\\*t, r\\*tard, etc). She also states how she purposefully cut open her leg so badly that it required medical attention just so she could take a day off without being harassed for a reason why. ~~She also posted a screenshot of~~ [~~Linus himself bragging~~](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinusTechTips/comments/15shydq/screenshot_of_linus_bragging_about_getting_away/) ~~about getting away with a crime if nobody speaks against him.~~  (Stealth edit here All he said was you'd know if he committed a crime because it would be reported quickly publicly).\n\nThe whole thread is damning, and really depressing.

We won't be giving any names for what I hope are extraordinarily obvious reasons, but what we can do is give you the following guidelines for problem solving and conflict resolution.  \n>  \n>Sorry that this is all boring and corporate, but here we are. Number one, always stand up for what's right. We're only a team as long as we're all working together and working for each other. That's the most important one. Number two, always reflect on your own personal experiences and use your common sense. Few things in life are truly black and white. Number three, always wait to hear both sides of a story before passing your own judgment. Be cautious when you know that one side is bound by legal and ethical disclosure guidelines, when the other is not. Carefully consider what it says about the character of someone who would engage in that type of gossip against someone who has no power to defend themselves.  \n>  \n>Number four, always encourage openness and transparency. If you have a problem, you need to speak up. We want to fix it. If you receive feedback about somebody else at this company, the first response is, have you spoken with this person? Followed closely by, you need to speak with this person. We don't solve interpersonal issues here, or really anywhere in your life, if you wish to live in a drama free zone, by engaging in water cooler politicking. So, if for any reason that individual is not comfortable approaching the person they're having a conflict with, we have a chain that they're supposed to follow.  \n>  \n>So first, you advise them to take the problem to their manager. Followed by me or Yvonne, followed by our third party HR firm. I hope that you all trust that we're here to make this a safe, fun, and productive workplace, and we won't tolerate mistreatment of any of our team members.  \n>  \n>If you have any reason to believe otherwise, then I refer you again to point number four, which is to address the issue with the individual directly, or bring it to me or Yvonne, or bring it to our third party HR firm. Since I'm not at liberty to share any details about what occurred, uh, all I can do is ask that you trust me and Yvonne.  \n>  \n>Um, some of you know us very well, I've been here a very long time, um, some of you have not been here for as long, but I like to think that whether you've been here for nine years or nine days, you're here for a reason and you believe that we are utmost to run this company with integrity and compassion.  \n>  \n>Um, We can't solve problems we don't know about though, so on that note, I'd like to invite anyone who has concerns about a fellow team member or about a manager to submit their feedback either by speaking with their manager, me or Yvonne directly, or if you would prefer to provide your feedback anonymously, we have an option for that as well.  \n>  \n>It's the manager and co worker feedback form. Uh, Yvonne, if you're not aware of it, show of hands who is not aware of it. Hey, a lot of people aren't aware of it. Good, so now we all know. There's an anonymous form, if for whatever reason you're not comfortable, (inaudible) you can talk to me or Yvonne directly about it (inaudible) in the general chat.  \n>  \n>It's a safe space to provide us ideas for improvement, or if you're consumed by the holiday spirit and you want to say nice things, you can do that too. Does anybody else have any questions?  \n>  \n>Not a single questions? Wow, that must have been a really good speech.  \n>  \n>(speaker 2, James)You gonna dance on that table, or just stand on it?  \n>  \n>(speaker 1, Linus)That's it! So, um, Yvonne, did you have anything you wanted to add?  \n>  \n>(speaker 3, Yvonne)(inaudible) Somebody said (inaudible) if you guys want to sanitize your hands, help yourself with free (inaudible)?  \n>  \n>(speaker 1, Linus)Yeah, that was actually just totally random timing. It came up the stairs a moment ago. Dennis is on it. Alright. Thank you everyone. Have a wonderful and, uh, productive rest of your day. And weekend.\n\n[A user points out how James makes a sex joke in the meeting of HR and Sexual Harassment](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinusTechTips/comments/15t1mzn/comment/jwhjesk/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).\n\n[Another user points out how this meeting was posted 6 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinusTechTips/comments/15t1mzn/comment/jwhjn7f/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and the [community had a different reaction](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinusTechTips/comments/11dltrr/unreleased_meeting_december_9_2021/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=1)\n\n[Another user states how Linus is not really shocked at the Madison allegations now as he claimed in the The Verge article](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinusTechTips/comments/15t1mzn/comment/jwhhuz3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n[Another comment points to the community reaction to Madison's leave from 2 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinusTechTips/comments/15t1mzn/comment/jwhxm7g/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n[Another post with Madison's reply to the audio of that meeting](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinusTechTips/comments/15t5dv7/madison_responded_to_lmg_investigation/)\n\nSeems like this situation could still evolve, so don't piss on the popcorn (I'm running out of popcorn)\n\nBonus 3: [User points out how Louis Rossman's comment on the Gamer's Nexus video feels like a parent's \"I'm not mad, just dissapointed\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinusTechTips/comments/15suz2m/comment/jwgb3bh/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n# Update 3\n\nReddit admin moment: they have removed the posts of the Madison thread\n\n# Update 4\n\nReddit restored the Madison thread post, so it was appealed.

At some point you're just doing the thing you're \"mocking\" and it isnt mocking anymore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInb4 \"the repetition is the actual joke, not the joke itself.\" No, Im including that, thanks. When the ONLY difference between you \"ironically\" earnestly plugging your overpriced merch to soar profits while underpaying employees and Logan Paul earnestly plugging his overpriced merch to soar profits while underpaying employees is the irony, theres no difference at all. You're getting the exact same rewards as Logan, but I guess cuz you didnt \"mean it\" its better? No, i dont think so, personally. Its the same point idubbbz brought up in his video on Sam Hyde, when you live in meta-irony, you've just circled back around to being genuine. The outcome is same as if you were, because theres just too much overlap. You might be ironically plugging the merch, but you arent ironically raking in the profits. A small nitpick, I'm aware, but even when I was a small fan of LTT i would cringe at these shitty attempts at \"satire\". Idk if anyone employs that word correctly nowadays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd again, Im not against a company earning money to stay afloat. Not at all. The channel gives free content due to their ability to make money off of merch and sponsors. No problem with that at all. The part I despise is the attitude around it, the same attitude that led them to making those same merch jokes in their *fucking apology video.* When you live in meta-irony, you've circled back around to just being genuine. You've now just genuinely plugged merch in a monetized video responding to a pretty serious callout from GN (and yes I know this was before Madisons post, but also making the lewd jokes is a terrible look and makes it very easy to believe her allegations) and youre now profiting off of tragedy. Despicable. But no, it couldnt possibly be that the culture of your company is the problem. Its that you, idk, read the room wrong.",

        "selftext": "The LDS Church operates a free, comprehensive genealogy website called Family Search. Unlike ancestry.com or other subscription based alternatives, where each person creates and maintains their own family tree, the family trees on Family Search are more like a wiki. As a result, there is sometimes low stakes wiki drama where competing ancestors bicker about whether the correct John Smith is tagged as Jack Smith\u2019s father, or whether a record really belongs to a particular person. \n\n\n[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genealogy/comments/178tvdn/familysearch_worst_scenario/) titled \u201cFamily Search, worst scenario\u201d is not the usual type of drama. The OP writes that he has been researching \u201csince 1965\u201d and has logged \u201ca million hours on microfilm machines\u201d to the tune of $18,000. Enter his \u201cevil sister\u201d who discovers the tree and begins overwriting the names and data, essentially destroying all of OP\u2019s work. OP laments that Family Search\u2019s customer support has not been helpful. \n\n\nSome commenters are sympathetic and offer tips on how to escalate with customer support. \n\n\nThe tide turns against OP however, when commenters seize on a throwaway line from the OP that some of the names in the family tree that the sister deleted \u201cwere in the middle\u201d of having \u201ctheir baptism completed\u201d. To explain, some in the LDS Church practice [baptism of the dead](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptism_for_the_dead). This has led to controversy in the past, including when victims of the holocaust were baptized. Some genealogists don\u2019t use Family Search, even though it is a powerful and free tool because they fear any ancestors they tag will be posthumously baptized. \n\n\nBetween when I discovered this post and when I posted it, the commenters are now firmly on the side of the \u201cevil sister\u201d who has taken a wrecking ball to a 6000 person tree. \n\n\nAll around, it\u2019s very satisfying niche hobby drama.",

He is best known for being a debate bro\u2019s debate bro, regularly streaming himself overwhelming opponents with dazzling displays of facts and logic. He also has a lengthy history of [controversial takes about the ethics of possessing child pornography, pedophilia, and age of consent laws](https://www.reddit.com/r/Enough_Vaush_Spam/comments/q9gkx3/vaush_is_obsessed_with_paedophilia_and_child_porn/), which his community defended in the past as being taken out of context or part of a bad-faith cancellation attempt by conservatives. Despite clips of these statements bubbling up occasionally, they tended to fizzle out with only minor controversy.\n\n# The Folder\n\nOn February 6th, Vaush was streaming a male fashion segment when [he unintentionally opened a desktop folder named TO BE SORTED](https://www.reddit.com/r/perfectlycutscreams/comments/1akm6p0/wrong_folder/), which, in the half-second its contents were visible, could be seen to contain:\n\n* A folder marked \u201cTaxes\u201d\n* Several non-pornographic images of Rauru from *The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom*\n* Various art of horses having sex with very young-looking girls.\n* Japanese VTuber Natsuiro Matsuri.\n\nThis last entry proved to be the hardest to defend, as the character is canonically 16 years old. It was also likely what caught the eye of Ethan Klein.\n\n# The Podcast\n\nEthan and Hila Klein are co-hosts of the extremely popular H3 Podcast. Three days after the folder incident, Ethan and Hila devoted most of a [4 hour podcast episode](https://www.reddit.com/r/h3h3productions/comments/1amyw1o/discussion_megathread_taylor_swift_celine_dion/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) to meticulously examining both the contents of the folder, which were confirmed to contain art by a known lolicon, as well as a massive compilation of Vaush\u2019s statements about CP and pedophilia. Anticipating the Out Of Context defense, they were fairly careful to include surrounding video of each clip; nevertheless, some Vaushites visited r/h3h3productions to voice their concerns that context was indeed being missed.\n\n>[the vaush thing is taken way out of context - he was arguing that people do not feel the same way ab child labor and exploitation. he has since said that it was an absolutely horrible way to explain that but yeah: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfvvWw63Yh0&t=859s](https://www.reddit.com/r/h3h3productions/comments/1amyw1o/comment/kpp3qtc/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)  \n>  \n>Agree 100%. I'm really disappointed the gang went into this without showing the full context. it appears they brushed the surface with their research.

People are now calling him a peado. Make fun of the horse porn. Make fun he was stupid enough YEARS ago to use this argument.
