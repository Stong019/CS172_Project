The walls aren't straight. The earthquake in 2011 cracked a lot of the plaster. The lifts require blind faith to get where you want, and there is no inner door. I have two children who have claimed the living room as their own territory. They won't even let me watch the TV. My 12 year old Skoda Fabia is literally on its last legs as the suspension is giving in due the abuse from Sofia's potholed and cobbled roads. However, this won't be changing until Phoenix Point is released with all the love and attention it needs.

            "[removed]",
            "Finally people are realising how anti consumer epic is, the rest of the people acting like they know better are misinformed even in this post. It's not just about a launcher, epic launcher is anti consumer.\n\nThere is no actual one Upside to buy it on EPIC either.\u00a0 doesn't mean people want to ditch where all of their friends are, where all their achievements are, where all their games saves have been saved, where you can make an informed decision in buying a game reading\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff the user reviews instead of paid media, where you can \ufefflook up stats of the users before buying an online game.\n\n\npeople are reasonably very angry about this and a lot of console gamers seem to be confused as a why PC gamers seem quote/unquote so entitled, let me make an anal\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeffogy say you really like Call of Duty and you own a ps4 well what if two weeks before launch Activision announced that the next Call of Duty game is going to only be on the Xbox one for the first year and then it'll go on all platforms and that the reason this happened is because Microsoft bought the rights for the first year of call of duty, this means that in order to play Call of Duty you would have to play it on an Xbox one you have no choice there is no competition.\n\nI really want to stress I made this analogy with a third party game this is not something epic games is making this is a third party title and makes sense the EA's games would be on their own platform, it makes sense the Ubisoft games would be on their own platform, but for a third party game being restricted to a specific store is not good for the consumer people defending this seem to mistake it for being good competition this is not good competition, the developer and publisher aren't leaving Steam that's not what's going on \n\nEpic Games is buying games to force them to be an exclusive on their platform, what would be good competition is if Metro Exodus was on both steam and the epic store, this is actually something we need, we need another company to really push valve to make steam better but this is not how you do it, again people are not leaving steam because steam is bad, Epic Store does give developers more profits and if this is the only reason they were leaving that would be great but it's not, people are not willing to leave steam and lose all the sales they would have made on Steam to make less sales on epic, that cut does not make up for that, so epic has to pay people to make their games and go on their store, exclusive deals like this aren't necessarily new to the gaming space on consoles but they are pretty new to PC gaming and this is why people are so upset, we DO NOT want this to become the norm, this is not good for consumers and this only benefits epic games\n\nPeople aren't upset just because they have to download another program people are upset because this is a whole bunch of bullshit the consumers shouldn't have to deal with to make all this worse the epic store is flat-out terrible compared to Steam, now keep in mind steam is not the world's best thing but comparatively it looks like the work of God\"Gaben\", epic store doesn't have cloud saving, reviews, message boards, achievements, in-home streaming, family sharing, there's no Linux support, there's no community pages, there's nothing like big picture mode, it is complete garbage in comparison, to make things worse it's forced DRM and ALWAYS online(you can't play exodus offline on Epic regardless of it being a fucking single player game.), this is why it's bad for the consumer we aren't going over to their store because it's a better thing than Steam, we're going to the store because we are forced to, nobody wants this, because it's enticing in comparison, it looks awful in comparison.\n\nAnd this is why you're seeing a lot of claim from people saying \"well I guess I'm just not gonna play a metro Exodus for the next year until it comes to steam\" or the other comments saying \"well I guess I'm pirating Metro Exodus\", which let's be real that means they're going to pirate it beat at once probably never play it again probably never buy it, these are people that would have 100% bought the game on Steam if it was on Steam or perhaps if the epic store was actually any good they'd buy it over there instead and give a bigger cut to the developer, but as it stands right now it's a trash fortnite launcher that people are being forced to use and all of this is because Deep Silver is greedy and wants money right \"now\" like most publishers do, the blame 100% goes to both Epic Games and Deep Silver for this, epic games for being incredibly scummy and really having an over aggressive marketing strategy for a product that's subpar on top of that it's a product I don't trust.\n\nIt seems to be selling a lot of information to people and people seem to reporting their accounts getting hacked rather quickly I don't trust my information in the store at all, now a new store is going to have some growing pains but at the same time Epic Games is not a small store and this clients been around for a little while because a fortnite, so they should have been working things out to, add on top of all of this the head of the epic store is one of the same guys that ran telltale into the ground, not only did he do that but he was also present as a marketing consultant for the dying days of Atari Midway accolade, I'm not sure how this guy manages to continue getting a job higher up but he always seems to fail anywhere he goes.\n\nEpic right now has a very aggressive strategy, I don't think it's really going to pan out for them I feel like more people are just going to boycott it but we'll see in the future and if it fails I doubt epics going to give up on their store maybe they'll start doing things the right way.\n\nPeople are to blinded by this and tell other people \"it's jus another launcher\"\n\nNo you dumbo you're being misled. ",

            "This siding with epics thing was so incredibly dumb of their part. What was they thinking? ",

            "All this talk of exclusives and nothing about PlayStation or Xbox or indeed Nintendo.\nI would love to play Last of Us or the Unchartered series but I've got a PC.\nIsn't it the same thing. One platform buys the rights to a title and nobody cares. Epic buys rights to a title and everybody loses thier shit? \nI honestly don't see what the big deal is. ",
            "Gamers, \"Steam is a monopoly that needs competition.\"\n\nAlso gamers, \"I'll never not use steam!\" ",
            "Unpopular opinion ahead:  \n\n\nIt's not a big deal for this game to be on the EGS, was a good business move for the company, and better for consumers if EGS offers competition to Steam.  \n\n\nSteam has a monopoly on digital games sales, I get wanting to have everything in one place but honestly it's not that big of a deal. The devs have also stated launcher is not required to start the game.  \n\n\nSome complaints are that you can't play offline, that it has security issues, and that china is stealing your info.  \n\n\nYou can play offline, this feature wasn't available in the 1st week so I believe that's where this info comes from.  \n\n\nEGS has 2-factor like steam, if you're not using 2-factor in 2019 you're at risk of being hacked. Use 2-factor.  \n\n\nFrom what I can tell, the information from steam seems to be when you merge your friends list.. so not sure why this is a big issue.  \n\n\nI understand that people want to have all their games in one library, but also understand that it means that all of your eggs are in one basket--for me this seems terrible anyway.  \n\n\nCompetition is healthy in any market. Steam sales? You bet EGS better have even better deals to compete, that's the beauty of it.  \n\n\nJust my 2 cents. Bring them downvotes bois."

I don\u2019t know the answer to that question, but my sense is that the family gave the gifts because they thought the fieldworkers were less fortunate. Perhaps they felt that the low pay, the difficulty of the work, the low status of menial labor in our society, or the tenuous legal status of these workers was unjust.\nI believe that charity is a poor substitute for justice.

No One voluntarily just moves to Juarez to live from US for the cultural experience, at least not during the cartel wars.  But no one ever talk shit to us. They helped us and gave us guidance when they knew we were about to have trouble. They never bitch about anything. After all this culture of hard working. This is 60 to 70 hours of bust your ass work and the average middle class worker.  Like a mid level police officer or nurse 300$ per month.. US.  Never bitch, still living life. The women especially with the trafficking and femicide and cartel wars.  You go to work and not sure if they would even make it home taking the bus 3 hours a day to get to work to make only 300 per month or less.  These are the hardest working people I've ever witnessed. Over all nicest and truly appreciate life.  I think it's the family culture and the tight community that they have that keeps them in love with there life.  So I don't know if anyone feels that they ever would take advantage of anyone first off that is a honest hard working person and that person is just doing the best they can.. I shouldn't have to even say this because to be honest. There shouldn't be a rule book that or a law that makes you do the right thing. It should be a natural  emotion",

Looks like their mods might be aware of what's coming as well.\n\nEdit: Some people are misunderstanding what I'm saying. My suspicion is the main reason the_donald hasn't been nuked yet is they are the largest subreddit for a political candidate during an election year and the admins don't want to invite that press coverage. If the hilllaryclinton subreddit was also being shitty they would probably be protected by the same principle until after the election. Once November 9th hits  getting rid of the_donald becomes much much easier and while it still might get some press coverage it can't really be portrayed as Reddit the company taking sides during an election.

            "I would like to start by saying as a co-founder I love /r/the_donald and (almost) all the people in it. Despite some old rumors I have never said anything bad about Trump and challenge anyone to find me doing so. I will be voting for him in November as I did last week in New York. \nThere's been a lot of modding/demodding and weirdness at /r/the_donald the last few days. It's been an interesting ten months but the it's over for some of us, so I am going to give the full story of what has happened while demonstrating little cissy and JCM do not have the subs best interest at heart, and have covered up really serious stuff from their own users, because the Navigators do deserve to at least know what happened.   \n\n4/23 - Overnight the head moderator of /r/the_donald (/u/jcm267) de-mods the #2-4 mods (lil-z, NYPD-32, and gumbledog) leaving Ciswhite and the remaining group and then deletes his account. No pre-warning or explanation was given to the sub in general or anyone involved specifically. JCM returns to Reddit with a poorly concealed sock: /u/jerk_stores.   \nBelow is the PM chain of JCM telling the story himself completely unedited:  \nhttp://i.imgur.com/nP2P1Mu.png  \n\n>It's a long but I fucked up, said a lot to a person who now appears to be that fucking tranny((1)) (I still haven't ruled out Hillary troll, Cis being a machiavellian asswipe, or someone else entirely). The least damaging thing I could have done for the subreddit at this point was exactly that.  \n\n((1))I'm making an assumption here but by \"that tranny\" I believe he means the individual who [posted a youtube ultimatum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwuPivtLAiU) for The_Donald to shut down. That's a whole shitshow on its own if you want to watch that. It's telling that even he can't be sure that Cis isn't running some convoluted operation here.   \n\n>No... I've been in email contact with someone. He had me going... long story is he was colluding with me to \"fire\" cis. He initiated the colluding. I gave away inner details about the sub. Doxxed no one (((2))though by tying Cis to his sockpuppets he thinks he might get doxxed). He presented himself as a white nationalist who happens to be in the media. I didn't agree with the racism, but he got me to agree that there's a racist presence in the_donald. When I calmed down and thought about it I realized I shouldn't be listening to this guy, I told Cis about all of this (I knew he would take it well, the guy is a psycopath), and proceeded to ignore the troll.  \n\nAll in this one paragraph JCM admits:   \n\n1) To engaging in a conspiracy against other The_Donald users  \n2) Handing out private information about the sub/mods/users when solicited by a complete stranger.   \n3) He didn't doxx anyone (but maybe did?)   \n4) This was swept under the rug and concealed from the other mods and the users.   \n\n((2))Little Cissy is terrified that his real life will ever be tied to his Reddit stuff so he uses sockpuppets, even if they're obvious. He's used them multiple times before to smear people. It's interesting because he isn't hiding that he's a Trump supporter IRL, or that he mods the_donald, or that he was the (now deleted) account(s). He was hiding that he was Ciswhitemaelstrom. Perhaps he knows it's not ideal to have a law student attached to a psychotic online pseudonym and all their rapey endeavors.  \n\n>Yesterday he sent me a PM asking when we could start with his \"plan\" and I told him that I had thought about it and we'd be staying the course at /r/the_donald. He sent me a \"seriously?\" PM and I said yes. A while later I got an essay from the guy and the tone had changed. He was fired up so I don't think he intended to take the mask off, but the writing had the same crazy/emotional tone as the tranny in the video. He was going to put everything he had together and put it to his \"contacts\" in the media. He was still presenting himself as a big shot. Another tell, he said that I had until 11:59pm tonight my time to reply. Well, that makes \"one week\" from the tranny video doesn't it? I know this tranny isn't the big shot he presented himself as but what he got from me would get to certain sites possibly some as popular as Gawker.   \n\nHe continued to receive ultimatums. Honestly, the threats seem really empty based on the information provided which makes the extreme lengths he took seem even more bizarre. What was he coughing up to this total stranger?   \n \n>I really screwed up. If I had simply dropped myself and made you top mod the \"this guy is a coward\" narrative would have stuck. I had to promote cis. We had to do damage control. Chat with Cis about it if you want his POV but please do not mention it to others. ESPECIALLY NewJerseyFreakShow that guy can't keep a secret to save his life.     \n\nThe cover up was already decided by jcm and cis some time before this PM but here he is giving an explicit cover up order to another person (me), telling me to keep it from the other mods and people I associate with on Reddit.     \n\nTo this day no one knows what type of information was given and who it was given to. When the de-moddings happened people were starting to ask about it and Cis was telling those in mod mail to let it quiet down.     \nYou may be a bit confused at this point. The first logical question is: How does JCM go from trying to fire Cis and handing out personal sub info to those two supporting eachother? It appears some sort of deal was made, we will never know the true details of it but we can figure out some of the concepts. JCM admitted flatly to me that this was a TRP takeover:    \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/8Z5jCzk.png   \n\nAnd you can see the deal forming further here:   \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/6ObWOLI.png   \n\nThe TRP mod gets top modded overnight, has the second TRP mod (GLO = GayLubeOil) ready to go, a couple others, then yet another JCM account (not jerk_stores) .. you know, the guy who just tried to betray people and consulted with anti-/r/the_donald trolls.    \n\nI imagine the arrangement went something like this: Cissy and JCM agree to keep this incident quiet, JCM transfers control to TRP, then TRP re-mods JCM as a lower mod and gives him lip service despite what he did. And just as I thought that today this post appeared:    \nhttp://archive.is/ZuoQw   \n\nIt's a really canned response that reads like he's reading a ransom note with someone standing just off camera. Circling the wagon of a guy who admitted to a colossal fuck up against the sub seems really bizarre. As far as cash goes that obviously can probably never be confirmed one way or another. The interestingly timed \"donation\" post seems a little less like coincidence at the moment. Cissy also heavily deleted comments by subscribers upset with the entire thing. Around half the comments look like they were removed:    \nhttps://r.go1dfish.me/r/The_Donald/comments/4g3twr/a_good_friend_of_mine_had_her_house_and_car/   \n\nSo there you have it. It was an interesting ride and now my part is over and everyone knows. The top mod and former top mod are into some really fucking weird shit and they colluded very clearly to make arrangements to keep fellow mods and the Navigators at large in the dark. Little Cissy has predictably started on the \"he's just butthurt\" talking point. I was never top mod of the_donald and never expected to be. It's a simple matter of respect and it's not there. I don't expect anyone to be happy with me but now they'll know the weird position I was in.   \n\nEdit: The support has been really nice, thank you. I've heard from SRD folks, former enemies, and some the_Donald members. I'm glad some saw this.",

Texas would have to buy and man embassies worldwide- that is, to whatever extent they'd even be recognized, itself likely an uphill climb.\n\n* Current Texans are American citizens and would be able to flee.

Obviously from business stand point Disney does not want behind the scene drama to explode in public that leads to the entire Mandalorian S3 getting cancelled.

            "Online leftists really need to learn a thing or two from the far right evangelicals. Sure, in primaries or local elections they will vote for complete nut jobs like Marjorie Taylor Greene, but if their preferred candidate doesn't win, they will still come out and vote in large numbers for the furthest right figure on the ticket. They understand how to get things done, how to place more center leaning figures in positions where they will not stand in their way when it comes to pushing far right ideas. \n\nAlso, I think Natalie's point in the video on how actual voters are is really important. Especially in terms of the Senate. Sure, Kamala Harris or Elizabeth Warren can push for much more leftist proposals and bills without severe risk of political backlash, but someone like Theresa Greenfield (if she wins) can't exactly go full BLM socialist agitator and still expect to keep a seat in Iowa. \n\nIs that unfair, is the senate undemocratic, is the electoral college rigged, yes, yes, and yes. But if you want to change that system you have to first win some amount of control and start getting some basic changes through. Get DC and Puerto Rico statehood, expand the supreme court, if your state has the National Popular Vote Compact on the ballot them vote for it, and in every democratic primary push for the furthest left candidate you think can still win in your district/state. Imagine if every major metropolitan area in the US was sending up candidates like AOC, if we had a leftist block like what the right has in the \"Freedom Caucus\", if we got more left leaning senators in deep blue states. The right has spent 40 years building up an electoral machine to get right wing judges, right wing policies, and right wing figureheads in place. \n\nIs it fast, is it impactful in the immediate timeframe, probably not. But all those LGBTQ+ people under threat from a conservative Supreme Court, or anyone who wants an abortion, or anyone who wants union rights, etc. etc. will thank you for a Biden presidency.",

        "selftext": "As the title states, nearly a year ago now the subreddit known as /r/animemes banned usage of the word \"trap\" when referring to characters that are femboys, trans, or girlish looking boys. The users went on a multi-month long crusade against the subreddit mods that ended in doxxing, real life harassment, the subreddit shutting down for an entire month, and finally with an exodus to a new subreddit named /r/GoodAnimemes. Technically, /r/animemes is still around and now has more members than it did even before the exodus, but /r/GoodAnimemes is also thriving.\n\nOnto present day, as some may know from some of the other SRD posts, June is officially pride month. I'm sure we'll have many many drama posts to come, with many surprises, but this one sure didn't surprise me one bit. Like was said in the title, /r/GoodAnimemes decided to give a quick nod to LGBTQ+ pride month by setting the subreddit's banner to a flag with multiple gay, lesbian, trans and non-conforming anime characters. Well... the humble denizens of a transphobic exodus subreddit didn't like that. Here's an image of the subreddit banner if you want to see it yourself. https://i.imgur.com/9NqIxrW.jpeg\n\nI'll start with my personal favorite, a post by a user named... NoTomboyGfWhyLivee... with some amazing commentary on the banner change.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/goodanimemes/comments/nq88pw/3_3_monthly_meta_post_for_june_2021_3_3/h09svte/\n\n>...\n\nSince we're starting slow, I'll include some people who simply claim to think the new banner is gaudy, crowded, or hard to see what's even on it.\n\n>[Definitely rethink the icon. It\u2019s a bit overcrowded as it is.](https://www.reddit.com/r/goodanimemes/comments/nq88pw/3_3_monthly_meta_post_for_june_2021_3_3/h09w2r3/)\n\n>>Yeah, feels tacked on at this point. It was already full.\n\n>[I don't like the new sub icon, don't mind having a rainbow in it but i can't tell what's in the picture without squinting and a lot of other subs changed to similar things , can't we get a more clear icon ? with the character more visible ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/goodanimemes/comments/nq88pw/3_3_monthly_meta_post_for_june_2021_3_3/h098cnh/)\n\n>>I dont understand why they decided to cover up the icon with something that has nothing to do with anime\n\nA simple complaint about visual clarity takes a sudden turn though.\n\n>>>Exactly my concern. Being specifically a weeb is entirely disconnected from Pride Month.\n\nSomeone replies, with heavy downvotes. Pointing out that many of the mods are LGBT themselves.\n\n>>>>Because it\u2019s a nice gesture, especially considering the entire mod team is some flavor of queer.\n\nA user (assumedly) chimes in with some vague concern trolling.\n\n>>>>>And why does this specific month get a nice gesture when so many other didn't? Where was the Black History month banner and icon? International Women's Day? Are we only pandering to this specific group because a lot of mods are members of it? So we give special treatment to people just because the mods are a part of their group? Isn't this the same political bs we wanted to escape when we made this sub?\n\nAnd another user starts the claim that the mods are just pandering. I'm guessing they're uh pandering to themselves...?\n\n>>>>>It has to do with the founding of the sub many of our users have extreme distrust towards this kinda of pandering harmless in itself yes but gives bad impression still\n\nThe original downvoted person replies again by pointing out that they could use the banner to 'prove they aren't transphobic like everyone things they are'.\n\n>>>>>That\u2019s the thing tho - due to that extreme distrust it seems as if the sub has a thing towards the LGBTQ community, and comments on any post mentioning traps seems to devolve into transphobic stuff fairly quickly. This both clears up the sub\u2019s stance (that LGBTQ people are cool), gets assholes to leave, and just looks nice as a whole.\n\nUsers chime in by saying they don't care to clear up they aren't transphobic (probably because they are, and refering to trans people as \"transgenders\" isn't helping).\n\n>>>>>Who cares about clearing up the sub's stance? That's just a nicer way of saying pandering to people outside the sub.\nWe know we arent transphobic; transgenders on the sub know wwe arent transphobic. Why should we care what anyone else thinks?\n\nWhile this comment thread has many many more replies, I'm going to move on since it gets very repetitive with people going in circles.\n\nOne user starts out by saying that the subreddit mods are somehow doing corporate pandering, and that they're tired of seeing gay people everywhere.\n\n\n\n>[I get that it\u2019s a huge thing, especially in the west where most of us probably live, but after being blasted by all the Pride Month stuff all day only to see the new sub icon and banner, just, yeah. I thought the sub icon had just changed to a straight rainbow. Made me remember when Reddit was black for a long while.](https://www.reddit.com/r/goodanimemes/comments/nq88pw/3_3_monthly_meta_post_for_june_2021_3_3/h09t8g2/)\n\n>[I\u2019m here for anime memes, so I would appreciate it if we could remain that way. Corporate-type appeasement is mostly made fun of, so I really hope this is like a one day or week thing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/goodanimemes/comments/nq88pw/3_3_monthly_meta_post_for_june_2021_3_3/h09t8g2/)\n\nA moderator of the subreddit replies\n\n>>Why do you all think this is a corporate thing? We aren't a corp, just a bunch of weebs.\n\n>>>I know that, obviously it isn\u2019t some corporate power move for money. It just seems cheap and pandering, like what most corporations do during Pride Month. I find it annoying for that reason.\n\n>>>Now should we do a full on Pride Month event? No, like you\u2019d said we\u2019re a bunch of weebs here for anime memes. I honestly don\u2019t see how it relates in any big way to weebs specifically so it comes off as maybe even appeasement.\n\n>>>Edit: I was trying to be vague in the whole appeasement thing because it might not be, but to me it 100% comes off as useless pandering appeasement. Just thought I should give my honest feelings on the matter.\n\nThe mod comes back and gets heavily downvoted again for making it very obvious that it's just an attempt to show the world how 'not-transphobic we are' (to a massive failure).\n\n>>>>Thank you for your opinion. We felt with our past history, this is a good way to let people know our stance on the LGBT.\n\n>>>>>Given our past history, why are we trying to pander like the old sub did?\n\nSomeone else chimes in that it's just a banner, and not banning people for transphobic like the old sub did.\n\n>>>>>>The old sub made a content moderation decision without putting it to a vote that impacted everyone then tried to paint its users as bigots for disagreeing.\n\n>>>>>>This is literally just a logo change for 30 days. It\u2019s not that bad, and they\u2019re certainly not on the same \u201cpandering\u201d level.\n\n>>>>>>>idk the mods advertising a political stance on the sub seems like something that should probably have gotten a vote, if you ask me\n\n>>>>>>>>i dont see how this is political? We are just celebrating pride\n\n>>>>>>>>the sub will run normally, except we will have a few cute flags up,\n\n>>>>>>>>i fail to see the issue? we didnt need a vote to change the banner at halloween?\n\nhere it comes\n\n>>>>>>>>>If you don't see how it's an inherently political stance, idk what to tell you...\n\n>>>>>>>>>>It is just ... a flag?\n\nI'm honestly not sure how to interpret this next post, if it's for or against the argument, but people are upvoting it so I wouldn't be surprised if it's confusing everyone else as well.\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>I\u2019m not entirely sure why you\u2019re surprised by people having this stance, considering how the sub was founded.\n\nThe thread continues into the slow ascent into insanity elsewhere. No wait, I meant the \"slow descent into wokery\". \n\n>[And the slow descent into wokery begins. Whether you like it or not, mods, rainbows and pride month are political. We need consistently used and enforced checks and balances so that this doesn't become a situation where mods are taking a mile from giving an inch.](https://www.reddit.com/r/goodanimemes/comments/nq88pw/3_3_monthly_meta_post_for_june_2021_3_3/h0afek9/)\n\n>[I'm saying this in good faith as I love this sub.](https://www.reddit.com/r/goodanimemes/comments/nq88pw/3_3_monthly_meta_post_for_june_2021_3_3/h0afek9/)\n\nA mod responds\n\n>>We will not apply any rules to pander to a certain group of people, so dont worry there, all we wanna do is, show lgbt folks that they arent alone, especially here in the anime community.\n\n>>You wouldnt believe how many lgbt people ive talked to from here since this sub's creation.\n\n>>The subreddit itself will still work the same way it did yesterday, all we changed is the icon and banner\n\nAnd someone continues the idea that the banner is pandering and political. Also goes into some unhinged rant about swaztikas, inclusivity and diversity.\n\n>>>Which part of rule 3 didn't you understand when ya'll fucking wrote it?\n\n    3. No Politics\n\n    This is an anime subreddit, so please keep politics away from here.\n\n>>>The community never asked you to pander to a political group, period. Whether it's \"just\" an icon and banner or something more. Are you gonna pander to white supremacists and neo-nazis next month or is this just certain political groups you guys wanna recruit into this sub? Gonna put a bunch of swastikas all over the banner? Yeah, didn't fucking think so.\n\n>>>Not everybody deserves to be a part of a community. \"Inclusion\" is not a virtue. If a group of people need you to plaster political propaganda all over a fucking anime meme sub before they'll join it, they can fuck off. They don't belong here and we don't need them here. It's their job to lurk and fit in.\n\n>>>>This has absolutely nothing to do with pandering to any political group.\n\n>>>>Sure, LGBTQ+ stuff can be seen as political, but its first and foremost part of people's personality and everyday life.\n\n>>>>Pride month isnt celebrating the political side of it, but the people who had the courage to come out to their families and friends and live their life as who they are.\n\n>>>>>Personality? Everyday life? What? Who cares if you\u2019re gay? Of all the gay people I know, their sexuality never plays a function in how we talk. There was no discussion about this. You guys keep saying \u201cit\u2019s a way to show we\u2019re pro gay\u201d. Where\u2019s the \u201cwe\u201d coming from? A select few people who decided to advertise some idea? Does the sub not advocate it\u2019s non-hostile attitude by simply not being hostile towards anyone? This sub isn\u2019t based on any sexuality or political sphere, by doing this you\u2019re putting words in other peoples mouth and advocating what no one agreed to. You\u2019ve made it politically charged by taking a stance\n\nAnother user isn't subtle about his bigotry whatsoever and says \"you don't see me demanding pandering to my bigotry!\" like it's some sort of accomplishment.\n\n>>>>>Then remove political symbols from the sub banner.\n\n>>>>>You know what's part of my personality and everyday life? Seeing pride month symbols and propaganda shat all over all of my hobbies and hating every second of it. Not holding my breath that you're gonna be pandering to me anytime soon, though!\n\n>>>>>Inclusion is not a virtue. Validation is not a virtue.\n\nThere's more to this guy's unhinged rant but I honestly couldn't care less to read the rambling of this absolute loser that the subreddit seems to be in complete agreement with so I'm gonna move on to another post comparing a subreddit changing it's banner to 'corporate wokeism'.\n\n>[I'm disappointed you guys fell into the attention seeking corporate month.](https://www.reddit.com/r/goodanimemes/comments/nq88pw/3_3_monthly_meta_post_for_june_2021_3_3/h096dvy/)\n\nBut wait... Someone recognized that user! Maybe some of you remember the drama where the founding mod of /r/goodanimemes turned out to be a massive racist, and transphobic. Context here: https://www.reddit.com/r/animecirclejerk/comments/i7abpb/this_moderator_stepped_down_completely_unrelated/\n\nTo nobody's surprise, this user is downvoted, for correctly pointing out that the person's opinion should not be trusted.\n\n>>Aren\u2019t you the guy who got demodded for being a raging racist, and proceed to say Trans people are \u201cdelusional\u201d? I feel like your opinion on LGBT rights would be somewhat biased.\n\nDespite the fact that the person himself replied to confirm that it is indeed him, one user is skeptical.\n\n>>>I looked at his account and it\u2019s 30 days old with little activity, almost none here. I highly doubt it, but this is the first time I\u2019ve heard about this.\n\n>>>Rather then who he is I think we should focus on what he actually said. I don\u2019t think everyone that upvotes or agrees is a raging transphobe.\n\n>>>>Likely not, but it\u2019s good to have a reference on why this guy is saying what he is, because during the Revolution a lot of genuine assholes got the reigns on the community and got the mob to attack fairly innocent parts of reddit.\n\n>>>>(For reference - both top mods of GAM were removed, one for saying the N word like it\u2019s going out of style [Outback] and the other for having 1488 in their profile. The guy who organized the freeze operation went on trans subs calling them tr\u2014nys. A lot of people involved used the excuse of \u201cfree speech\u201d to spout hate speech.)\n\n>>>>On the 30 days old thing - might be a new account. I know this guy from the GAM discord, back from the first week of it, [and he has yet to change his views](https://i.imgur.com/beWTfRO.jpg)\n\nThe accused member then responds with a straight up transphobic slur, the one that ends with -ny, not p. Although automoderator picked it up, a person immediately points out the transphobic slur.\n\n>>>>>I don\u2019t hate tr\u2014nies\n\nand the accused member defends himself... (not downvoted btw)\n\n>>>>>>It's a shortened form of transgender I don't see the problem\n\n>>>>>>>It\u2019s one of the most well-known slurs in recent history?\n\na user named \"IHateTrainDander\" (hmmmmm) chimes in by claiming that we think everything is a slur now.\n\n>>>>>>>>Apparently everything is a slur now\n\nBack to the slur, a mod gets downvoted for pointing out the rule they used to justify deleting the comment\n\n>>>>>No politics\n\n>>>>>>Ban me\n\nThe mods are now straight up refusing to ban an openly transphobic user.\n\n>>>>>>>thats not how it works, to prevent mod bias, bans are done automatically using a bot\n\nand the guy is actually offended that he isn't being banned. worst person you know just made a great point....\n\n>>>>>>>>Dumb way to run it\n\nOnto more comment threads, I'll highlight a few one liners.\n\n>This sub is supposed to be apol\u00edtical, lets keep it that way\n\n>Pls no Trap War 2: Electric Boogaloo. I don\u2018t want to move sub again.\n\n>You know, for all the people who strongly defended the word Trap not being a transphobic slur and just a part of the anime culture, there's a lot of vocal backlash here over putting a rainbow in the sub icon for one month. To be clear, I think the exodus to this sub was the right decision, but I'm seeing maybe there's a line that many here stepped over in doing so.\n\n>Sounds like hypocrisy don't you think? You wrote rule \"No Politics\" and yet you just doing what you want and bring politics into this sub.\n\nSome users are now urging **another** exodus.\n\n>Fuck all the mods, fuck this place, I am leaving, and I urge everyone who feel the same way to do the same. They have proven themselves to be cucks time after time, no more.\n\n>>yeah, imma dip tf out too\n\n>>k bye\n\n>Man this comment section is a shit show. Maybe you mods should respond to the negative feedback so ya know, something can be solved? But whatever, youll probably just lock the comments at some point. Theres literally thousands of memes making fun of corps and other entities for doing this (pride month stuff) and then yall do it. Like it or not, its 100% political in the United States (where most redditors are from) therefore it breaks rule 3\n\n>Looks like this sub has become just as shitty as animemes with their lgbtq bootlicking\n\nI want to point out that this next comment is currently at negative FIFTEEN downvotes.\n\n>[Happy Pride everyone!](https://www.reddit.com/r/goodanimemes/comments/nq88pw/3_3_monthly_meta_post_for_june_2021_3_3/h096m1b/)\n\nAnd this next one is negative SIXTEEN. (Gumi is the subreddit's name for the automoderator btw)\n\n>[Good Job Gumi. Happy Pride!! Luv U all](https://www.reddit.com/r/goodanimemes/comments/nq88pw/3_3_monthly_meta_post_for_june_2021_3_3/h098ah6/)\n\nAnother user gets downvoted for disagreeing with all the complaints.\n\n>Feels like people who have issues enough to post complaints about a simple rainbow filter should feel free to go to the other sub. Far as I can tell they haven\u2019t done that alleged \u201ccorporate\u201d action yet. If you actually mean it when you say your issue is the presence of a rainbow and not the recognition of LGBT existence you should have no issue simply following their rule to not use the word \u201ctrap\u201d so you don\u2019t have to see ROY G BIV\n\n>For the rest of us, happy pride! I\u2019m gonna jerk off to so much hentai this month. Also I do agree with the person that said you should up the contrast of the background image on the icon.\n\n>>This sub was specifically created because the mods on the old sub did this kinda pandering political stuff.\n\n>>The mods here aren't supposed to do stuff like this with no input from the users\n\n>>>Thats where you are wrong.\n\n>>>It happened because the old sub changed their rules to appease to LGBT folks.\n\n>>>We literally only changed the sub icon and banner tho, so there wont be any change in operation of the modteam whatsoever.\n\n>>>>sooooo...\n\n>>>>Virtue signaling?\n\n>>>>>Is it really possible to call it virtue signaling if we are LGBT ourselves?\n\n>>>>>>Yes.\n\nBack to the original comment, some users are showing their discomfort with \"politics\" being on their anime meme subreddit, and again concern trolling by bringing up black history month. Then for some extremely odd reason brings up pedos being hunted???\n\n>>Some people don\u2019t like having Pride Month intersect with an anime meme subreddit while no other recognition months have had any effect. There was a precedence set, especially with how this sub was founded. LGBTQ subs exist and they recognize it plenty. Why do we have a leave the sub made for anime memes?\n\n>>By all means enjoy Pride Month, but this kind of hostility is entirely unwarranted. Sounds a lot like the Pedo Witch Hunt where even slight detractors were instantly labeled pedophiles.\n\nLet's top this thread off with the weirdest fucking take so far.\n\n>I wonder what the middle east logo looks like\n\nAnyways. That's all there is to this thread for now, but that's not the end of the drama just yet. Some members have moved on from the meta thread to show their discomfort with the pride month banner to the entire subreddit. The user starts a petition thread claiming that the mods of the subreddit need to apply a more fair interpretation of the no politics rule.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/goodanimemes/comments/nqhtk3/i_dont_care_what_they_are_this_is_not_the_place/\n\nThe thread is a bit short, so I'll start with the one liners.\n\n\n\n>[I come to this subreddit to get away from all the political bs.

It's akin to a child protesting how their friend gets x or y.\n\n    Reddit:  \"Why do I have to go to bed at 8:00?  Google's parents lets them stay up until 9:00\"\n    Parent:  \"Well, I'm not Google's parent.\"\n    Reddit:  :: pouts ::\n\nFor cloud services, Google and Amazon would gladly take Reddit's money for being inefficient.  I comprehend what they're trying to say, but they're shoe-horning half-baked parallels.  Reddit doesn't discuss value their customers will receive.  Instead, they ignore reasoning and immediately skip to invoicing.  **JUST GIVE US MONEY!!!**\n\nAlthough, in the case of Google or Amazon, if they see a competitor/service which has high usage, they'd just outright buy it or ~~steal~~ develop their own version.  That's been the norm with many companies for eons.  Don't like something or \\*really\\* see a start-up or commodity as eye candy?  Buy it!  Can't buy it?  Steal it.  Can't steal it?  Crush it.  \n\nMuch of this sounds like reddit suffering from both sunk cost fallacy and being stubbornly cheap.  On one side, reddit (or any company) may monetize their API access.  Yes, they're a business and that's within their right.  \n\nBut don't play a surprised Pikachu face when people demonstrate valid criticism.  With the sunk cost, reddit wants people to use their objectively inferior app.  It seems like they have no desire to ~~copy~~ develop tools their competitors adopt -- because money.  Nor will they unconditionally acquire their competitors through a buyout, again, because money.\n\nThis sounds like reddit being too frugal for their own good.

The general consensus is that it is likely heavily filled with Trumps supporters and their rhetoric was far beyond the bounds of normal Sanders supporters that most of us know in our lives.

You are clearly totally compromised at this point, whether by money, naivete, or straight up threats to your family's lives, and you will be very lucky if i don't vote Trump just to ensure you and your new masters fail spectacularly.

There are A LOT of misleading titles, lack of article reading, and just an overall ignorance of how American politics work. People make fun of Facebook for this quite often, but I think reddit can be just as guilty of it from time to time.",

It's in my best interest to further these task forces that would have never existed under trump. \n\nAlso, Trump really really sucks, and as much as I'm sure Biden will continue shooting kids in the middle east, atleast he'll not do all this \"I'm the god king of America!\" Nonsense that the current American fascist party are doing. \n\nI get that a lot of people don't like Biden, and I'm not going out of my way to put his bumper sticker on my car or go to any of his rallies becasue he's a garbage man, but he's so much better than the alternative. And as someone who cares about policy, I'm interested in seeing how far these task forces go.\n\nI'll never tell you how to vote, I get the whole \"don't vote shame me\" thing, but just really think about who you're going to support and what you can and cannot change with electoral politics. Do some direct action, get up an join an organization, and when it comes time to vote, maybe try and vote for the candidate who you'll really think does the least amount of damage. \n\nAlso yeah Bernie has been saying that shit for forever and these people are foolish to think he'd never support Joe.",

For example, I do use Google products like sheets, gmail, Google Drive, docs, Hangouts, etc. Could I find open source alternatives for them? ehhhh, kinda-sorta... but they have wildly different interfaces, of wildly different quality, and don't always play nice together, etc. Also, many open source companies are going the route of large companies as well and are getting bought up. But, I don't think this is a simple good vs evil situation. Another example, I think a vast majority of kids are being schooled from home right now via Google Classroom which is a \\*free product during lockdown - Teachers I've spoken with have said it's a great suite of tools for teaching remotely, so they would not want to see Google taken down.   \nHaving said all that, there have to be distinct limits to one company's influence, power, ability to monetize, etc. How that will be held n check is a great question, and deserves a lot of discussion and legislation.",

        "selftext": "Backstory: Back in July, 2020 the competitive Super Smash Bros scene underwent a deluge of accusations and confessions revealing numerous instances of rape, sexual assault, sexual harassment, abuse, grooming, misogyny, racism and more. \n\nOf the many abusers that were outed was Gonzalo \"ZeRo\" Barrios. ZeRo was the king of competitive Super Smash Bros for Wii U. He went on a guiness world record making run of undefeated tournament wins and cemented himself as an eSports legend. For the entirety of Smash Wii U's competitive lifespan ZeRo was the undisputed #1 player and most renown personality. ZeRo was a brand ambassador for Nintendo, a Twitch Partner, top 5 Smash personality and was known the world over. Even so far as competing on live television during Evolution 2018. \n\nTo go into further detail about ZeRo's illustrious career could take an entire novel. As stated before in July 2020 ZeRo was exposed for grooming a 14 year old girl who was a fan of his over Skype when he was 19. ZeRo initially denied the allegations multiple times and made numerous twitlongers that tried to exonerate himself but he eventually confessed once the evidence was undeniable. \n\nJust as many other abusers ZeRo was banned and exiled from the community permanently and in the process rightfully losing everything he worked for since he was 13. This brings us to today where it was reported by ZeRo's former fianc\u00e9 Vanessa that ZeRo attempted suicide.\n\nNow the Smash scene still has an issue with defending abusers especially the scene on reddit. The thread below shows how some people believe that ZeRo's suicide is proof that cancel culture has gone too far and people were and still are too hard on ZeRo.\n\nFor me personally while it is saddening to hear that ZeRo is in such a place I do believe the shaming, banning and shunning of him was 1000% justified. ZeRo groomed a young girl and had forever traumatized her and proved that he was willing to let her get thrown under the bus and harassed by lying about his abuse. He deserved to lose his career and is lucky he wasn't legally charged. While I hope he recovers it cannot be understated that his punishment was justified and that his current actions are result of his actions alone. \n\nThread: \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/md0lq1/vanessa_zeros_former_partner_shares_that_gonzalo/gs72z2f?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/md0lq1/vanessa_zeros_former_partner_shares_that_gonzalo/gs6v4k8?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/md0lq1/vanessa_zeros_former_partner_shares_that_gonzalo/gs7akej?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/md0lq1/vanessa_zeros_former_partner_shares_that_gonzalo/gs7m8e3?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3\n\n\n\nHope I did well for my first SRD post.

But the guy took it in the wrong direction and polarized it so much that the only possible outcomes are you see what he did as redeemable from the beginning and are allowed to feel remorse, or you're unforgiving and should just shrug at him trying to kill himself. There's a whole spectrum of thoughts and ideas and very complex emotions in between that are just invalidated by being thrown into two bins.\n\nI think it's ingenuine to dismiss the idea that you can be hesitant to forgive someone on a personal level while also wanting them to forgive themselves and become a better person who is mentally healthy.

Some of those jobs might even use some of their existing skill set.

The internet has no sense of that distinction and often goes too far. \n\nBut complaining that \"cancel culture\", the system and methods of holding a wrongdoer accountable in the public sphere, goes too far is just horseshit. It is likely very painful and upsetting that to the wrongdoer that their entire world and identity implodes and falls apart. But what about the victim(s) and the hell they have to endure as a result of actions by the wrongdoer? What about the pain, grief, and fear they have to go through following the incident(s) and the damage that does to them for the rest of their.life?\n\nThe anti-cancer culture crowd wants their social icon to go back to the way things were. They invested too much in their fandom for their idol and they don't want that enjoyment to go away. They want the golden high life back for their idol so that they don't have to feel guilty over their support and promotion of the wrongdoer. They feel betrayed.\n\n**Cancel culture as a tool for valid criticism and awareness is here to stay.** But the harassment component needs to be equally criticized and condemned. \n\nIt's fine and good if the wrongdoers reputation is destroyed. They need to make amends and start over. That's taking responsibility for your actions.

I think he needs serious mental help, both for the suicide attempt  and for what he did to minors. Then, I want him in some office job where he's just another regular joe, or alternately on the front lines of an organisation that helps children, if he truly wants to try and earn his redemption. 20, 30 years later, well I don't know.

Any sub or website that tries to be open to everyone is going to learn really quick that social media warns and bans people for good reasons most of the time. Advertise your relative lack of rules and you'll attract people who don't want to follow *any* rules.\n\nPCM was founded on this idea that a sub that focuses on content, not discussion, on a site that rewards popularity, could claim to be open to all political sides and *not* get eventually taken over by the people kicked out of the popular political subs wanting a platform instead of refuge. Add to that the soft encouragement to use predrawn assets to depict your side as perfect and the other side as strawmen, and you get the worst of the worst of internet politics, where \"discussion\" is just taking turns to lie about the other sides. On top of that, the most despicable of takes get put into this quantum state, where it's a joke if someone disagrees, or a good point if it gets some form of approval. And that approval itself is done half-jokingly so they can claim agreeing with racism was being done ironically while subconsciously excusing it.\n\nThe memes I've seen come out of that sub have at best had great generalizations, and at worst been downright hateful. The idea of the quadrants probably gave people further validation, where they felt like they belonged to group, and could disguise their half-baked political ideologies and actual hatred as just more banter against the other groups. It's yet another example of how, with the expansion of the internet, people get informed of opposing opinions far less than they find places that already tell them what they want to hear.",

Said some things that made me feel guilty and I might delete this thread if he asks me to.  I guess the damage is done though.  Nice job dicks who harassed him, he seems like a nice enough guy.~~  \nSaid to keep it up but he wants nothing to do with TEFG anymore.    \n\nThe Evil Farming Game is an old computer game that involves a farm, hiding the murder of your wife from police, and other vague creepy details.  \nIt was first mentioned online 4 years ago in a sub for finding video games;\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmyjoystick/comments/4h5w1w/this_game_was_kind_of_like_harvest_moon  \n\nThis got some attention for some reason, and people began to hunt. People were communicating with OP, mentioning games they find which are similar to either have them confirmed or ruled out. Nobody can find it. A couple of years pass and another post is made, this time by a different person. It seems to sound like this fellow is looking for the same game!  \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmyjoystick/comments/a6wfbm/pc_evil_farming_game/  \n\nThis fueled the fire even more. People were wondering just what this \"Evil Farming Game\" was, why it was made, if it even exists. The gaming mystery caught some traction with a couple of popular youtubers and was featured in a couple of videos. It was around this time, a year ago that /r/ThatEvilFarmingGame begun.  \n\nA community which spent a year naming possible games, following leads, being trolled here and there with \"broken laptops\" and just waiting for the day \"Sparta\" (OP of the first post) confirms \"Yes this is the game.\" The Subreddit grew to 10,000 people in a year and even branched off onto Discord. At some point someone decided to start a project of re-Creating this game based on the details known. The whole thing started to form it's own little cult based on the idea of this vague game.  \n\nTons of threads, searching and speculating.  \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ThatEvilFarmingGame/comments/k5ousd/idk_if_i_found_something_but_it_might_be_worth/  \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ThatEvilFarmingGame/comments/jc6u6g/i_believe_the_evil_farming_game_is_confused/  \nDozens of this nature. It's all guess work from everyone, they only have a small list of games they know it's not.  \n\nAfter some time most users seem to reach the conclusion it doesn't exist.  \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ThatEvilFarmingGame/comments/ihp5yr/we_all_know_its_fake/  \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ThatEvilFarmingGame/comments/ijjuke/can_we_stop_with_all_the_troll_posts_and_this/  \n\nOne day a suspiciously low quality, yet credible picture of a game was posted. With it were matching known details and some new ones.  \nFor the first time there were also detailed descriptions of the game play mechanics, which sounded like a playable game. It was topped off with the usual story of \"on a friends old PC, better evidence soon. There have been many open ended promises of the like over time and people were jaded. However this thread had a ring of truth to it, for what it was.  \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ThatEvilFarmingGame/comments/kt6dcf/this_has_to_be_it_right_the_premise_is_exactly/  \n(Actual screenshot)  \nhttps://imgur.com/AVQw8P8  \n\nThen it was deleted after only a day. The OP telling the moderator that they feared doxxing, knowing how big it would be to reveal the actual game. They would report back with real evidence soon.  \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ThatEvilFarmingGame/comments/kt9cjl/why_the_op_deleted_his_post/  \n\nDeleting it like that seemed to add credibility to it and gave people hope that this time the game would be found. This person wasn't looking for fame. They deleted their entire profile. The original story of how the game was found and how the screenshot was taken was flawed under a microscope, but also completely plausible. A few other people came out and said they had played this game before, or it was familiar. It was looking to be promising.  \n\nA lot of speculation occurred.  \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ThatEvilFarmingGame/comments/ky0kfj/what_do_you_see_in_the_screenshot/  \n\nThe general consensus being if it was a real game it maybe even THE game. The moderator of the sub was in communication with \"Sparta\" (OP of TEFG) allegedly. He sent the screenshot over.  \n\n>\"I can't tell, not good enough quality.\"  \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ThatEvilFarmingGame/comments/kxk5dd/not_a_lead_for_the_game_i_am_sorry_about_being/\n\nThis provoked a lot of questions, naturally.  \n\nMost people agreed that despite the low quality picture, the game itself was quite clear. Clear enough that it SHOULD have gotten a clear yes or no from the only person known to have played it.  \nPeople began to question the moderator more. They questioned this alleged \"Sparta.\" They questioned the whole premise of That Evil Farming Game.  \n\nUntil the game in the screen shot surfaced they were in limbo and questioning everything once again.  \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ThatEvilFarmingGame/comments/kt9cjl/why_the_op_deleted_his_post/gj41mmm/  \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ThatEvilFarmingGame/comments/kx48zw/someone_somewhere_is_lying/  \n\nThere was one user who became particularly active at the same time the OP of the screenshot disappeared.  \n\nThis person made a very long thread breaking down why they thought the screenshot was plausible. They were also grilling the moderator pretty hard with questions the Mod couldn't seem to answer, across other threads. This user was apparently trying to establish the credibility of the alleged \"OP\" and the Mod's communication with him, and knowledge that it was in fact the same person.  \n\nThis user would post a paragraph of 4 or 5 clear questions and the moderator would reply with very vague answers to 1 or 2. There were claims made of the moderator having an alt, or more. This user claimed to be getting downvoted 3 times in quick succession on replies to the moderator within moments of the moderator replying. Some posts deleted.  \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ThatEvilFarmingGame/comments/kx48zw/someone_somewhere_is_lying/gjdbgqi/  \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ThatEvilFarmingGame/comments/kx48zw/someone_somewhere_is_lying/gj9z6vd/  \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ThatEvilFarmingGame/comments/kx48zw/someone_somewhere_is_lying/gj83tlt/  \n(Image in reply: https://imgur.com/a/EVbADTF )  \n\nThis person was very determined to find hard answers.  \n\nIs the screenshot real? Is it The Evil Farming Game? Is the moderator even in communication with OP? How do they know it's actually OP? Why can't OP ID the game?  \n\nA popular theory is that it is some sort of scam to promote the game being built to \"recreate TEFG based on known details.\"  \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ThatEvilFarmingGame/comments/k92j7i/i_am_starting_to_think_efg_is_a_advertisement/  \n\nIn a twist, this new and active user came out and made a thread: after a week of asking dozens of questions which had poor answers and writing a books worth on the subject of TEFG.  \n\nThey admitted to being the one who spent hours fabricating the screenshot.  \n\nThey had burned a 6 year old, 50k karma account which originally posted the screenshot and story to add more credibility to the whole thing. They made a new account just to question the whole idea of the game, make people think about it. They had also left breadcrumb's of evidence along the way expecting it to turn up. It was another more clear screen shot, with a fabricated email conversation posted in the comments of one of the screenshots imgur links.  \n\nThe post had proof of deleted posts mentioning how it's probably marketing. They revealed that they had spent the month on and off coming up with the idea as a way to \"investigate\" if the game was real. They stressed they were doing it in nature of \"investigating\" and not as a troll job, hence admitting it. After a long break down of a lot of \"evidence\" of all sorts of things the fake they were met with mostly mockery or hostility. They edited the post to simply say \"I misunderstood the purpose of this sub. Yes, I deleted my own thread.\" Before deleting the thread and vanishing.  \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ThatEvilFarmingGame/comments/kzb5hm/the_truth_about_the_screenshot_and_the_results_of/  \n\nAfter some time this user came back. They had posted a long breakdown of the situation the day after the screenshot was posted. The thread got a lot of traction. This post was now edited to include a more condensed version of \"the investigation\" along with admitting to falsifying evidence up top. The user claimed they had done it all for their own curiosity. For the purpose of the hunt and that they were satisfied with their answer; \"the game never existed.\" They deleted the original \"grand reveal\" of apparently a months work of investigation due to the hostility. Only revealing the truth of the forgery in an edit on the old thread and a couple of replies to old comments.  \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ThatEvilFarmingGame/comments/kts7og/new_to_the_hunt_just_some_thoughts_about/  \n\nWhat do you think? A long con troll? A real investigative tactic? Does the game exist? Why does someone care so much? Why did I spend all afternoon going through this?",

            "This just makes me think of that legendary Clock Man thread from Bungie.net.  \nBack in 2012, the user Commander Santa described an animated short they'd seen on TV as a kid.\n\n[Here's the original thread](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Post/3393860?sort=0&page=0) and description of the short:  \n> This short animation was terrifying as a child. The scene is still burned into my mind (28 years later). It's of a young boy sleeping in his bed. Above his bed is a ticking clock. All the lights in the room are off and it is very dark. Suddenly the clock begins to slow down it's ticking and eventually it stops...on midnight. When the clock stops a Greenish/Bluish man climbs out of the clock. The boy wakes up just in time to see this man dressed in black grab him out of bed and kidnap him by carrying him through a window. The \"Clock Man\" takes the boy on some kind of terrifying adventure and brings him back to his bed before sunrise.\n\nSome people recognized the description and many shorts were suggested as possible answers, but none of them were what the OP was looking for. Eventually people started believing that the whole thing was an elaborate troll post (me included tbh) because it went on for so long, and it became one of the most well-known threads on The Flood (Bungie.net's off topic section). \n\nThen FIVE years later, [the short suddenly shows up on YouTube](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Post/240315673?page=0), and it turned out that the whole thing hadn't just been an elaborate troll by Commander Santa this whole time.",

            "This happens sometimes in the lost media community. Someone talks about something they remember, other people say they remember it too, but with no evidence of its existence it could just be a large Mandela effect where people's imaginations wished it into existence. This sounds like it's a similar to what happened with a supposed lost anime called Saki Sanobashi. A 4chan user posted they remembered this anime on the deep web with a few reference photos. A few other people say they remember it, and over the years there are large search efforts to find it, a search subreddit was created, even some animators making concepts of what they think it could be. Then one day on the subreddit, a user came forward claiming they were the original 4chan poster and said they just wanted to mess with people and never thought it would go this far. Since it was an anonymous 4chan poster, the only evidence they could bring was the images from the 4chan post being saved from his phones from years ago. There's a split on the people who believe him and the whole thing was made up, and the ones who say he's a fake and the anime might still exist.

Provides a very interesting tweak to the Russia story and likely is enough to show that Trump himself isn't a witting Russian puppet, but likely had allies with inappropriate relationships with Russia, as well as being willing to take what was given regarding election interference with Russia.\n\nTLDR: Trump dun fucked up the game",

            "I can see why TD is going crazy, here's the possible likely scenarios.\n\nThe gas attack happened and Trump attacked because of it. In 2013 he said Obama should not do anything after Obama said a chemical attack was his thin red line. This makes Trump look like a liar, Trump always tells the truth so this can't stick.\n\nThe gas attack was a hoax and Trump attacked not knowing it was a hoax. This makes Trump look weak and incompetent. They tried to say it's the (((deep state))) that tricked him, but that still makes Trump look weak and incompetent so it's not going to stick.\n\nThe gas attack was a hoax and Trump attacked even though he knew it was a hoax. This means Trump is part of the (((deep state))), but we all know he's not a pawn in their international game of tic-tac-toe, so this can't stick.\n\nThe crazy one most likely to stick is that Trump did not order the attacks (originally it was that the FAKE NEWS lied about the airstrikes until Trump said they happened) and that the military did it all on their own for no reason. It means Trump doesn't look weak because he was hard at work at the golf course, and it doesn't make him look like a liar because he didn't order the air strikes.\n\nWe'll have to see what the trollbots have in store for us because I don't see them spreading any of these scenarios. Putin has too much too gain if Trump ordered the attack, but the trollbots can't make Trump look incompetent because there is still more to be gained outside Syria. It's risky for the trollbots to say nothing, without their guidance the Trump supporters will be forced to create their own scenario (the last one I gave) to fit their view that Trump is an omnipotent god that never lies. They'll wonder why Putin is yelling at Trump for what the evil military did all on it's own.",

            "\"I do a shitty job at being a mod so I'm quitting and it's all YOUR fault!\"\n\nI noticed this wasn't one of the mods who was in the GR video so I was curious if this was a sort of humble resignation because the community was exposed as being absolute shite (again). But no, turns out it's just another petty asshole who takes things way too personally because someone liked a game they didn't like. I seriously feel like if that subreddit had an even halfway decent moderator team, NONE of this would have happened. That subreddit is in serious need of new moderators who actually know what the f\\*uck to do with it.\n\nThe funniest part is that Evil-Kris is going on about how nobody is hearing \"their side of the story\" but...they HAVE no side of the story! They've said NOTHING beyond an embarrassing post that amounted to nothing more than \"Boyfwiendweviews didn't accept our apowogy and that makes us weally weally sawd....\" \n\nNo, Evil-Kris. Nobody is out to slander your community. Truthfully, nobody really gives a shit. Not even its mods. It's not even one of the more annoying hate subreddits. The only reason why it ever comes up in conversation is if the community (and yes, I am saying \"the community\" because when one guy is backed up by so many members, including the most important ones, it's not \"just one guy\") tries to start shit with other people, which happens EVERY TIME someone speaks positively about The Last of Us 2. You could have stopped this from happening; there is no reason why TheRealRogerEbert's post should have been up, and there is no reason why you or any of the other mods shouldn't have contacted that user to get more information about the supposed death threats he was receiving. Instead, the mods of that subreddit chose to lie about GR and shift blame to them for calling your community out. When the shit finally hit the fan, ya'll cowardly locked the subreddit and removed anything that would make your community look shitty (didn't work though; it still looks shitty). You've done fuckall as a mod anyways, so honestly, that subreddit isn't losing anything of value with you leaving. Also, I know you said you don't read hatemail, but I have a feeling you're reading this whole thread. Because you seem that petty. I mean hey, you're petty enough to be a part of /r/TheLastOfUs2, you're petty enough to throw that shitty comment together, I'm sure you're reading this now.\n\nI'd like to close this little rant with a very accurate description of the mods of /r/TheLastOfUs2 from our good friend Evil-Kris.\n\n> The shameless lies of lazy, immature egoists clawing the walls in their desperation to find ways to escape the reality of having a 'real' job, is what it really is, with no qualms distorting the truth in order to preserve their internet 'fame' and get some controversial content for their flagging fanbase, who sadly soaked up their tall story like bread in a sloppy bowl of Borsht.\n\nIn all seriousness though, I genuinely do hope Evil-Kris gets some help or maybe a little bit of perspective. Take a break from the internet for a while; realize that this game and this petty drama isn't worth getting so hung up about. It's not that big of a deal.\n\nAnd if anyone from that subreddit that genuinely cares about the community is reading this, please, advocate for a new mod team. The team you have now are just kind of assholes, and I don't think they understand how to moderate well at all. If they did, this wouldn't be happening. Also, if you do have \"your side of the story\", please say it. You've said pretty much nothing about \"your side\" so far. It'd be a good opportunity to \"expose the lies\" that GR made, but it seems like the only real lie is that they sort of exaggerated how much time you guys have spent on them? I guess that's sort of a lie???? I dunno. At the very least I'd like to know why you took their review of TLOU2 so damn personally. I mean, I hate Pokemon OR/AS, but I'm not calling any positive review of it \"condescending\" and failing to properly moderate my own anti-ORAS subreddit.\n\ntl;dr - Get some actual damn moderators.",

It's takes small steps exposing them to new opportunities, for example, I'm about to go and see a young (20 y/o) guy who spends most of his time in his room gaming usually only to leave the house for a weekly game of D&D. Today we are going to work out how to make a dice tray out of recycled materials. We'll need to go to the recycle center and paint store, come up with some creative solutions, do some research online, and figure it all out using basic tools. It's fun, he loves it, and he loves sharing the things that he makes with his D&D crew. We've already made a dice box, game mats, and a phone holder, and started learning CAD. Smalls steps in skills development but massive leaps in confidence.\n\nAnother young man I work with doesn't leave the house except with family. I introduced him to abstract photography and now we have weekly outings shooting around town. His creativity is off the hook and I often find myself envious of his ideas even though I have been a creative for more than 25 years.\n\nThese guys have abilities that go unrecognized and anything we do and every kindness we show them only goes to help them discover who they can be.\u201d",

Maybe the weird goony cretin has some major brain problems you don't know about.\n\nBut there are limits to everything. Take, for example, the story of a guy I'll call Greg. That's not his name, it's just really easy to call the Gregs of the world fuckers; I make no apologies to any Gregs out there. Greg was a friend of a friend and got invited to a discord server we'd set up to accumulate our  friends from across various games we played - so yes, there were a lot of neckbeardy shut-in sorts in this place, whole lot of weirdos and strange pitfalls to navigate to keep everyone happy. But Greg was a special sort of fucked. He was miserable and did his best to make sure everyone else was miserable, he refused to offer even the slightest sense of social grace to anyone else so any time he entered the chat he'd belch or eat loudly into the mic, talk over everyone and try to constantly take control of the conversation to redirect it to whatever he wanted to talk about even if literally no one else knew what that subject was and clearly didn't care, and he would constantly pick fights with people who were literal authorities in subjects he knew nothing about. Zero respect for anyone else, always smugly saying respect had to be earned. Yet he was also the first person to throw a tantrum any time someone didn't show him proper respect, or somehow slighted him, or even joked about him in any way. When people started actively avoiding the server and chat because he wouldn't stop talking about how much he wanted to fuck little anime girls, he started saying we were conspiring against him and threatened to kill himself, eventually rage quitting the server when it came out that he had been pestering every woman in the server for nudes - and using the same \"oh woe is me I have depression and will kill myself if you don't give me what I want\" act to get what he wanted from many.\n\nThat's the abridged version - but my point is that the Gregs of the world are the bulk of the shitheads who post in places like the various incel dens on reddit or hawk their terrible bigoted opinions in the usual offmychest style subreddits. They're the neckbeards people shit on for being gross, slimy assholes. They don't want help because they're convinced they're the only ones who don't need it. The internet is full of Gregs and every single one just *wants* you to bend over backwards to pat their ass and tell them they're just a woefully misunderstood sensitive soul because that just feeds into their fucking complex.",
            "I think that if you can help someone without the significant detriment of yourself (mentally or physically), then that's an option. No one is technically obligated to help others, but you'd think that people would because of empathy and having the ability to take on that commitment and responsibility with that person.\n\nEveryone deserves help. No one is obligated to help (unless it's their literal job). That is the actual conflict here. \nIt is the conflict of individual resources and energy to help someone else out. It takes commitment and it means taking on another responsibility. \n\nThe same way reaching out to friends is not mandatory, but almost necessary to maintain relationships. Reaching out and hanging out takes social energy. It becomes a commitment to reach out and support. And it's hard, especially when you feel isolated and alone. \n\nDepression and anxiety can be a real kicker and without support, it's incredibly difficult to dig yourself out of, with and without anti-depressants. \n\nI think it would be good to develop programs to help these people find better ground, but as an individual, I think it's ok to take a step back and ask yourself if you can afford (mentally, physically, financially, etc.) to support someone else in need.

How else can they really care so much?\n\nThey say getting that strong in an apocalypse is unrealistic but seem to glance over the idea that a male protagonist is a bit overweight in the same environment.

Even when Nate's partner is a 60 something thin-ish old man that smokes cigars but can still mostly keep pace with him even if he can't make all the bigger jumps.

        "selftext": "## Background:\n\n**What is Premier Student Housing (PSH)**? It is a Los Angeles based [property management company](http://premierstudenthousing.com/) that operates in several apartment complexes in the Westwood area under the moniker \"Axiom Apartments\" near the UCLA campus. The company claims to delivery luxury housing at an affordable price, but many [Yelp reviews](https://www.yelp.com/biz/axiom-westwood-los-angeles) allege incredibly incompetent management and several maintenance issues, as well as shady business practices.  They also seem to have a history of harassing former tenants online and [responding to negative reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p9l5ua/bruinwalk_response_from_psh_sounds_awfully/). PSH operates four or five complexes that predominantly serve UCLA students.\n\nHousing in Westwood and near UCLA is typically in short supply and high demand, which makes the scramble for housing a yearly anxiety for Bruins. The area is home to some of the highest [rents in the country](https://www.latimes.com/business/real-estate/story/2019-10-09/westwood-california-highest-rents), and students often sign leases out of desperation or urgency. Landlords are therefore known for shady practices due to the long line of tenants that can replace any single unhappy tenant despite negative reviews and a long list of reasons not to rent with them.\n\n**What is a shill and bot**?\n\n*Bots are automated Reddit accounts controlled by bot software.*\n\n*A shill, also called a plant or a stooge, is a person who publicly helps or gives credibility to a person or organization without disclosing that they have a close relationship with said person or organization whom they often have a vested interest in.*\n\n**What is RED LOBSTER?** Red Lobster Hospitality LLC is an American casual dining restaurant chain headquartered in Orlando, Florida. According to their tagline, it is a \u201clively chain restaurant serving American seafood standards amid New England-themed decor.\u201d The closest location to Westwood is in Inglewood 23 minutes (13.1 mi) away via I-405 South, although there are reports that there was a Red Lobster near Westwood 20 years ago.\n\n\\-----------------\n\n## How it started:\n\nOn August 21, u/catsinthemainframe posted [an extensive negative review](https://redd.it/p8j8o6) about her experience living in the Axiom Apartments at [555 Levering](https://reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p8w3fc/me_seeing_all_the_premier_student_housing_memes/h9tsb1k/) as a warning to potential tenants  not to rent there. Among her claims, she alleges that PSH does not vet roommates, has moldy and humid units, expensive utilities, horribly unprofessional management, slow maintenance, terrible plumbing and more. One of the biggest claims is that there's excessive water damage throughout the building which makes it unlivable in many ways. Since then, PSH has gone on a rampage with their alt accounts, accusing anyone who either sympathizes with OP or speaks out against PSH of [being OP on an alt](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/paa76u/a_shady_landlord_deploys_an_army_of_alt_accounts/ha4549a/).\n\n## What happened next:\n\nPretty soon the thread gained traction and made it to the top of r/UCLA. Hilarity ensued when [students began](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p8j8o6/avoid_premier_student_housing/h9vp949/) to call out the surge of pro-PSH accounts that replied to the thread to [discredit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p8j8o6/avoid_premier_student_housing/h9rg85t/) accusations of [shilling](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p8j8o6/avoid_premier_student_housing/h9qzyo6/), [push back](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p8j8o6/avoid_premier_student_housing/h9r87jb/) on the post's narrative, [share positive \u201creviews\u201d](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p8j8o6/avoid_premier_student_housing/h9r7lvr/) of PSH, [question](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p8j8o6/avoid_premier_student_housing/h9r6kpd/) OP\u2019s story, or simply be [rude](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p8j8o6/avoid_premier_student_housing/h9r4jsa/) and [obnoxious](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p8j8o6/avoid_premier_student_housing/h9r61sd/) to OP. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/lzlgx8/axiom_westwood_apartment_hunting/gw4mrxo/) hilariously encapsulates what the community was up against.\n\nThe PSH shills [threatened](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p8j8o6/avoid_premier_student_housing/h9rebtm/) [lawsuits](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p8j8o6/avoid_premier_student_housing/h9r8bz2/) against OP and anyone who propagated claims against Premier Student Housing. They even made absurd claims like [nobody who is 29 could ever be a UCLA student](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p8j8o6/avoid_premier_student_housing/h9rg042/), and that therefore OP had to be lying. One of the shill accounts, [u/Fearless-Cellist1666](https://www.reddit.com/u/Fearless-Cellist1666/), even went as far as to pretend to be OP's former roommate. Intimidation against the OP resulted in threats by PSH shills to [call OP\u2019s parents,](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p8j8o6/avoid_premier_student_housing/h9r8sbk/) presumably to get her in trouble and coerce her into deleting her story.\n\n>You should know that management may be able to find out who is making these fake complaints, and that they could contact your PARENTS. There are consequences to spreading fake rumors. I highly doubt you would want your PARENTS contacted.\n\nIn another thread, Attorney u/immigratnthrowaway explained the [stupidity of trying to sue](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p8qsvc/premier_student_housing_iykyk/h9vwzvf/) someone over this. They believe that it wouldn't at all fare well for PSH.\n\nu/Hugefootballfan44 posted about how they called out PSH for their [fake reviews and shilling tactics](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/nj3bxa/housing_questions_and_roommate_search_megathread/gzx5vzi/?context=3) months ago.\n\nMany students wondered whether these accounts were automated bots, but u/prikaz_da astutely pointed out the more [likely scenario](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p8j8o6/avoid_premier_student_housing/h9r93pl/): that they are single-use shill accounts made and owned by PSH employees.\n\nu/BadingBadongPingPong explains how most of these accounts in question follow [similar username formats](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p8j8o6/avoid_premier_student_housing/h9r91f9/) and are likely the alts of the PSH landlord and other employees. The username formats are aligned with those that are generated by Reddit when you create a new account. And although this element is not necessarily indicative of an account being affiliated with PSH, it does shed light on the laziness of PSH for failing to come up with creative usernames and instead using the suggested usernames, since most of their shill accounts follow this username format.\n\nu/omparadigmshift then [explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p8j8o6/avoid_premier_student_housing/h9rg4bb/) that \u201cit's incredibly obvious only a technologically illiterate incompetent boomer of a landlord would do something like this\u201d and that the accounts are similar in their syntax, grammar and typos. And then went on list out every shill account that posted in the thread and how they were likely in violation of Reddit\u2019s TOS.\n\nIn another thread u/UCLAecondude, a UCLA alum, [shared their story](https://reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p9n7nr/the_premier_student_housing_starter_pack/ha1pwsr/) and experience with PSH and how happy they were for them to get their deserved negative recognition.\n\nFurthermore, in now removed posts PSH shill accounts doxxed OP\u2019s twitter account and insisted that a few vague tweets were evidence that the entire story was made up even though the tweets proved nothing. You can see them talking about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p9n7nr/the_premier_student_housing_starter_pack/h9z3tkf/) through another shill account.\n\nStudents like u/Zekkenn even spoke about [creating support groups](https://reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p8w3fc/me_seeing_all_the_premier_student_housing_memes/ha3x4za/) for those unfortunate enough to be stuck in a lease with PSH. And yes, they are [serious about it](https://reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/pae2ls/premier_student_housing_resident_support_group/).\n\nThe drama and memes escalated so quickly within 48 hours that even regular users on r/UCLA were [confused at to what exactly had occurred](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p98kca/someone_make_a_timeline_asap/) here. Imagine being away from the subreddit for two days and then logging on to [see this on the front page](https://reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p9pgcp/hey_rucla_im_running_to_red_lobster_does_anyone/). As a result, [many bewildered](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p9pgcp/hey_rucla_im_running_to_red_lobster_does_anyone/h9zt01u/) students  [begged for context](https://reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p9n7nr/the_premier_student_housing_starter_pack/h9z1njy/) from those lucky enough to see it all go down in real time.\n\n## The Memes:\n\nSoon after the original expos\u00e9, memes began to pop up on r/UCLA that poked fun at the absurdities of the debacle. The comments section of some of these early memes became battlegrounds for more exchanges between PSH shills and r/UCLA regulars.\n\nThe [first meme](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p8lvd9/wish_my_inbox_luck_guys/) was posted by u/BadingBadongPingPong. As expected, a PSH shill followed up with more [lawsuit threats](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p8lvd9/wish_my_inbox_luck_guys/h9rdtlr/). u/LaserPigeons, who posted the [top comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p8lvd9/wish_my_inbox_luck_guys/h9rbg4h/) in the thread, talked about the absurdities of (now shadow banned) PSH shill u/OpenChallenge2 backtracking their threats & using a \u201cUCLA Student\u201d flair as a method of signaling credibility, which OpenChallenge2 [replied](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p8lvd9/wish_my_inbox_luck_guys/h9rc0b3/) to by upholding their claim of being a real \u201cUCLA science student.\u201d\n\n>Are you 5 years old? I was literally trying to help the kid by telling them what their irresponsible actions could lead to. You're not very bright, are you?  \n>  \n>And yes, I am a student. A science student at UCLA.\n\nWhile with the same account and in the same thread also stating:\n\n>There's a lot of bad info going around and people are spreading it. HOWEVER, have you guys ever heard of something called a LAWSUIT? Yeah, it's not a good idea to make things up. Trust me.\n\nu/BlakersGirl and u/Luciditi89 then [point out the incredulity](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p8mn6t/yeah_its_pretty_interesting_stuff/h9roh6u/) of any \"student\" ever being so adamant about defending their landlord to the point of threatening lawsuits.\n\n[Memes](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p8ms3u/premier_student_housing/) about UCLA science majors then sprouted up.\n\nMore memes followed. u/Bismark20 [posted one](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p8mn6t/yeah_its_pretty_interesting_stuff/) about the nonexistent \u201cUCLA science\u201d major. And when u/Primarilyrants [responded](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p8mn6t/yeah_its_pretty_interesting_stuff/h9rghh9/) to it by making fun of OpenChallenge2 for threatening to call someone\u2019s parents, OpenChallenge2\u2019s reply birthed another meme:\n\n>I'm going to say this again! It's actually hilarious that everyone thinks I'm affiliated with PSH. What's funny is that I only saw this topic after getting home from RED LOBSTER. I only commented because I wanted to talk about my own experience with Premier, which was overwhelmingly positive. If only people weren't so gullible so as to believe EVERYTHING they read, this would not have happened. College is supposed to teach you how to critically THINK.\n\nThe head scratching and random reference to Red Lobster left everyone in tears. And it is still not clear what point was being made by bringing up their trip to Red Lobster, [as pointed out](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p8mn6t/yeah_its_pretty_interesting_stuff/h9sth38/) by [u/Luciditi89](https://www.reddit.com/u/Luciditi89/). This non sequitur would go down as one of the biggest memes of the entire scandal as people began posting [RED LOBSTER](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p8tcnw/red_lobster/) across [r/UCLA](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCLA/). Users then started changing their flair to \u201cScience \u201924\u201d or \u201cRed Lobster\u201d in response to the ridiculousness of it all. Red lobster [memes](https://i.redd.it/rfe8bnke8ej71.png) shortly followed. A meme about UCLA getting a [new sponsor](https://reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p9j9u4/new_jordan_jerseys_looking_better_than_pshs_future/) for their athletic wear. UCLA [changing](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/paepvh/ucla_announces_a_new_and_improved_college_of/) its name. [Donald Trump](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/pahcvw/when_someone_asks_me_why_i_go_out_to_red_lobster/) and Red Lobster. [Housing advice](https://reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p90owm/some_advice_for_students_renting_apartments_for/) for students with a cryptic message.\n\nSomeone even managed to [successfully Rick Roll](https://reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p934r9/water_damage_causes_mold_at_psh_axiom/h9ynwty/?context=3) a PSH shill account.\n\nWe also saw [Parody ads](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p8vfc8/great_apartment_for_science_majors/). [Copy pastas](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p8r34v/seriously_you_guys_need_to_cut_it_out_already_its/). More [copy pastas](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p8tiqb/this_is_what_i_have_to_say_to_all_you_losers/). u/JTD783 even [designed a lovely t-shirt](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p96zlo/i_will_call_your_parents/). A [PSH Starter Pack.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p9n7nr/the_premier_student_housing_starter_pack/h9z3tkf/) Memes about [lawsuits](https://reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p9u7d3/psh_really_just_wants_a_fight_dont_they/). We saw [memes](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p8w3fc/me_seeing_all_the_premier_student_housing_memes/) from students who recently signed leases with PSH. The latter thread saw more [shilling and weak attempts to quell the backlash](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p8w3fc/me_seeing_all_the_premier_student_housing_memes/h9td4sa/). As well as more students sharing [PSH horror stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p8w3fc/me_seeing_all_the_premier_student_housing_memes/h9v5w2h/). u/Greybag exposed PSH for their [aggressive marketing tactics](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p8w3fc/me_seeing_all_the_premier_student_housing_memes/h9uvp50/) on Facebook. You can see more lobster and PSH memes [here](https://reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p9szay/i_will_just_say_that_i_am_a_science_major/), [here](https://reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p9t5xu/alignment_chart/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p97ulc/when_someone_claims_you_arent_a_ucla_science_major/), [here](https://reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p9rssr/meanwhile_at_red_lobster) and [here](https://reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p9pocr/premier_is_affordable_anyways_anyone_want_tacos/).\n\nu/omparadigmshift even visited the property and [documented evidence of extensive water damage](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p934r9/water_damage_causes_mold_at_psh_axiom/) at 555 Levering.\n\n## The \u201cBots\u201d:\n\nAs comments in support of PSH quickly populated the original thread, this alerted many r/UCLA [regulars](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p8j8o6/avoid_premier_student_housing/h9r91f9/) who found it suspicious. It turns out that accounts promoting or defending PSH are nothing new to r/UCLA. There seems to be a presence of PSH shill accounts on r/UCLA dating back to early 2020.\n\n[One user](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p8j8o6/avoid_premier_student_housing/h9r59dr/) pointed out how easily one could find this past activity.\n\n>Google \"reddit, UCLA Premier housing\" And have fun looking at all the accounts with 2-3 karma points and only 4-5 posts in their entire history.\n\n## A history of shilling:\n\nIn [Example 1](https://redd.it/ezovds) from February 2020, we see shill accounts like u/Sam1999LA, u/Ryder2217 and u/ThinInterview3 respond to a thread where the OP questions PSH\u2019s professionality. All three comments talk about how amazing PSH is and go into detail about their \u201cawesome\u201d amenities. It is clear that these accounts are shill accounts created specifically to promote PSH.\n\nIn [Example 2](https://redd.it/fezavt) from March 2020, we again see u/Ryder2217 and u/ThinInterview3 reply to a post where commenters share negative reviews of PSH.\n\nIn [Example 3](https://redd.it/ko23d3) from January 2021, u/Imaginary_Bed_6499 posts a thread alleging that PSH assigned them a mentally-ill roommate and did nothing when concerns of unsafe living conditions were brought to management\u2019s attention. The post also alleges claims of manipulative managers, stolen packages, bad Wi-Fi, expensive utilities and more. u/Apprehensive-Cap9632 and u/New-Brain5568 then sprang into action to shill for PSH, even attacking a rival complex to take the heat off of them.\n\nThis is a common theme with the shill accounts; they regularly attack neighboring apartment complex *Ophir Terrace* and its manager Linda. It seems evident that they suspect anti-PSH posts originating from this Linda person and her team. When in reality it's more likely that the source of bad reviews comes from somewhere more obvious: unhappy tenants.\n\n[Example 4](https://redd.it/lzlgx8), originally posted by u/jargon3327 in March 2021, is also rife with suspicious PSH shill accounts and the OP later edits their original post to surmise that much of the activity in the thread must have been PSH management using throwaway accounts to shill for PSH. The new accounts are u/Apprehensive-Cap9632, u/Witty-Measurement658, u/New-Brain5568 and u/PracticalFee7792.\n\n>So at the time I'm writing this, this post is about a month old and I'm very, very confident that no one would viewing this in r/ucla's main feed. Tbh it didn't even get that much traction when I first posted it. Yet, in the past 24 hours three different users with suspiciously identical user tag syntaxes (see below, they're easy to point out) posted in staunch defense of Axiom and Premier. Imo these are most likely throwaways for Axiom/Premier to defend their name by dropping self-written reviews in the most ludicrously obvious way possible. Good thing I didn't sign with them.\n\nYou can see more in [Examples 5](https://redd.it/mk6ims). A [shill post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/mk6ims/apartment_hunting_tips_please/gw4jfun/) by u/Apprehensive-Cap9632 even attacks Axiom's former manager, which is evidence of the current manager's pettiness and probably suggests some inner-politics within Axiom's management team. u/New-Brain5568 makes an appearance as well. In another thread you can see more examples by u/Weird_Study9055.\n\nIn the end you have PSH accounts like u/Fancy_Cranberry5414 claiming to be [actively pursuing legal action](https://reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p8qsvc/premier_student_housing_iykyk/h9ykhen/?context=3) against OP and that they have \"big evidence.\" Spoiler: they don't. They've since gone and complained about everything that happened [on other subreddits](https://reddit.com/r/byebyejob/comments/p5jnxc/thoughts_and_prayers_to_those_hurt_by_cancel/h9z0x1r/?context=3) as if this wasn't all self-imposed and their own fault.\n\n>I am sorry to hear this. I hate cancel culture. My business was a target of it and everything was lies lies lies and deceit.  \n>  \n>They have nothing and remember that is when they resort to slander, then people join on only because they want to bring you down to their level.  \n>  \n>They are sad excuses for humans and will get bad karma in the end.\n\n**Note:** A complete list of suspected shill accounts can be [found here](https://reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/pa6zzi/subreddit_drama_the_rucla_premier_student_housing/ha41pda/).\n\n## Author's thoughts:\n\nIt is quite alarming how many accounts Premier Student Housing's management has made to keep up their shilling. They maintain at least 20 accounts that all espouse the same exact views. Many, indeed, share the same grammar and syntax errors which suggests a single author, but a couple of them are a little more coherent. So, I think it is likely that the bulk of these accounts are operated by a single manager, most likely an older woman who manages some units within the Axiom Apartments and that many on the subreddit are familiar with. She even references herself in the alt accounts. There may also be 1 or 2 managers helping out with this campaign. Axiom seems to have a group of 4 or 5 managers according to Yelp posts, so I'm assuming they're all involved to some extent.\n\nYou would think that in light of such backlash and negativity they would get off of reddit and perhaps address all of the complaints listed not only on the original post but in past posts and on Yelp as well. If they spent as much time monitoring Reddit for negative reviews as they did doing the necessary upkeep of their properties, they probably wouldn't have this problem. Many Yelp reviews expressed how they failed to respond to urgent emails or address tenant complaints in a timely manner. It's really clear why this is. They spend all of their day shilling on Reddit, looking for bad reviews with accounts that can be discerned by anyone with half a brain to be fake.\n\nAlso, this is a textbook example of the Streisand Effect in action. If they would've said nothing, it would have probably been a 10-comment thread, forgotten after one day. But instead, they chose to pick a fight and now memes and complaints about Premier Student Housing will forever be indexed by google for potential tenants to read. They continue to expose themselves as incompetent and unprofessional, basically affirming all the negative reviews on reddit and yelp. There were only ever a few options for them: don't respond and absorb the marginal cost of another bad review, respond like morons and pour gasoline on the fire, or be responsible landlords and fix all of their issues by humbly accepting the feedback. We know what route they chose and subsequently how dumb they are. Premier Student Housing: please do better and grow up.\n\n## TL;DR\n\nby u/Prikaz_Da\n\n>If you haven\u2019t figured it out: Someone posted about their negative experience with a property management company, and the company seems to have encouraged employees to make accounts in order to combat the negative PR. They\u2019re evidently pretending to be students and coming up with awkward cover stories. These efforts have backfired spectacularly, as everyone is parodying their posts now.",

So here we are. \n\nTrust me, I don't like centrist Democrats much more than I like centrist Republicans (though I definitely like both of those groups more than far right wing fanatics). And I'm a proud leftist who wants many of the same things as Bernie preaches. If there was another viable political party for me, I'd be in it. But there isn't so here we are.

Whereas 9/11 the trauma was psychological, 2016 seemed to have triggered trauma of an ideological nature among young Americans. \n\n2. That reason is what I think inspired the phenomenon of the personal devotion of Bernie, instead of what should have been the political devotion of the ideals he embodies. A lot of Bernie supporters feel a very personal relationship with him. Most of the context of what I read on here are more about defending his honour or slights against him, while defending attacks on his policies or the implementation is almost an afterthought, even often gets framed as ad hominem. While most people would disagree when called out on it, reading the general trends, it does feel like that if given Bernie the man or the Bernian ideals but without the man, many would choose the former.\n\n3. As for Clinton? She definitely gets a double standard when it comes to these things, and also bad faith arguments like \"she put Trump in the presidency because of XYZ\", but on the whole I'd say she gets judged in the same Lens as Bernie: as a person before the ideals she embodies. I can't attest for her supposed lack of moral fiber, but I guess I don't really care either way, just as I don't care how personable or upstanding Bernie is. Their policies were similar enough, and both showed competence and the ability to be held accountable. More bitter races happen with less vitriol from the public.",

Before yesterday he was ranked at the second highest comment karma of all time as archived [here](http://www.karmawhores.net/user/Unidan). \n\nOn Wednesday, Unidan gets into a slapfight about animal terminology. The argument itself is pretty inane, but revolvs around referring to jackdaws as crows. Unidan is a biologist who specifically researches crows, so this apparently stikes a nerve. This is [posted](http://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/2c31hk/unidan_gets_mad_about_crows_and_jackdaws_in_an/) to /r/subredditdrama and he [shows up himself](http://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/2c31hk/unidan_gets_mad_about_crows_and_jackdaws_in_an/cjbm4jw) in the thread, and everything seems to be all in good fun.\n\nA couple of hours later, Unidan is [shadowbanned](http://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/2c5cxa/unidan_shadowbanned_after_jackdaw_kerflufle/).

Do you have any idea what's going on?\n\n>from Unidan[M] via /r/babyelephantgifs/ sent 6 minutes ago Haha, truly no idea, I sent a message to the admins as I'm a bit confused.\n\nSpeculations abound, with news of the ban even [making its way](http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2c6eqj/unidan_banned/cjce8jm) to /r/conspiracy.

He probably clicked the np link back to the original thread from the SRD thread, switched over to normal participation reddit to say something in the original thread and got in trouble by a bot for it or something. They'll probably reverse the ban when they realize he was already part of the original thread.\n\n>Yeah, there was a ton of pissing all over that thread. A lot of people probably got justifiably banned and unidan got caught in the dragnet.\n\n>I feel like there's gotta be a ban-bot. So many users get Bob'd then re-instated after ~24hrs. Likely he just tripped that and he'll be back in a couple of days.\n\n/r/adviceanimals thinks that he was banned for, uh, getting too angry and thinks it's somehow the fault of the teenage girl he was arguing with. So they immediately deploy [le reddit armey](http://archive.today/gTwlK) on her. All of [her posts](http://archive.today/FubKp) are downvoted below -100 points.

It really shows poorly on his work ethics, ~~and I hope it affects him in real life~~ (Harsh comment that was spur of the moment, I don't really want a guy to lose his job or get his life fucked over that). He showed that he is not above gaming the system to show is opinion is right, shows that he is biased in his opinion (downvote people he was arguing with). Tell me a guy like that can be trusted not to cheat on his research result to get the data to lean in his favour, and be able to have a genuine scientific debate, because hey, if he deems you are wrong, he'll try to silence you! Not saying that he is or implying that he is, only that this incident is casting a big shadow on the value of his word and his ethic. \n\nAnd before you say \"It was only 5 upvotes, no big deal\", he acknowledged that he knew it had weight. And if I recall correctly, quckmeme got banned site wide for vote manipulation and they weren't using a lot more alts.\n\nEdit: Formatting and clarifications, Sorry for the poor english. Also, after seeing what my post looks like, holy shit I am taking this too seriously, but I believe with reasons since it not only affects reddit but also the scientific community.\n\nEdit 2:\n\n>Tell me a guy like that can be trusted not to cheat on his research result to get the data to lean in his favour, and be able to have a genuine scientific debate, because hey, if he deems you are wrong, he'll try to silence you!

Her friend definitely doesn't attribute \"twitter bullying\" as the cause of her suicide, and if anything says that his behavior was probably a factor. \n\nHe's a bigot using a dead woman as a shield because she can no longer speak for herself.",
            "It's a good thing Chapelle offended a bunch of people because it's the only reason anyone is paying attention to this special. Legitimately one of the most boring and unfunny standup specials I've seen in a long time. I Guess the new trend in comedy is 'don't put any effort into being funny, just make fun of a politically sensitive group of people and complain about people being offended about it until people stop paying attention to you, at which point pick another group of people to make fun of and repeat the cycle.'",
            "Dave Chappelle is a millionaire. He is not getting 'canceled' by people. He said things, put them out there for the world to see, that hurt and offended a group of people. Those people dissagreed with them. That's freedom of speech. So is their request is to take it down. If Netflix were to take it down, that's not an attack on free speech. That's a private company doing what it wants, not the government - it's not an attack on free speech. \n\nI haven't seen the special but I do know that making jokes about Trans people is literally the lowest bar. It's Ben Shapiro humor. It's appealing to the lowest common denominator, it's like making a fart jokes but you also get the added benefit of rallying homophobes and TERFs. You get the wrong people laughing. They are one of the most marginalised communities, with the highest suicide rates. Its kicking someone when their down. \n\nPeople that say not to get offended by jokes, their just jokes, so on and so forth - no. If you make an offensive joke and it's not funny then you've just made an offensive statement. The problem with this special, is seeminglt Dave Chappelle made a bunch of offensive trans jokes and a group of people laughed - everyone else didn't. So he made a bunch of offensive statements.",

A joke like that is political by proxy, but Chappelle's \"joke\" is just political ranting with a veneer of humor. Which is fine!

At $25m, Netflix would need Chappelle's special to bring in 100,000 new subscriptions for two years or more to justify that price tag. People are correct to raise questions over this.)",

            "Honestly, can comedy please move past the \"You can' say \"X\" thing, anyway here's a joke about \"X\" thing. OOO people are going to be mad because I said \"X\" thing.\" Its lazy and getting really stale. So many comics just lean into anti PC comedy but it is so played out and honestly is trying to move anything forward. If you look at the Bo Burnham special it is completely different and is both real, funny and offensive at times but in a completely different way. The idea that comedy should offend is fine, if the point of that offense is to push the boundaries of \"comedy\" and to push for positive social change (think Lenny Bruce) and not to just get an easy laugh. Anti-trans jokes ae not examining anything, being anti PC isn't trying to push anything. Insulting Minorities has been a thing for as long as jokes have been a thing, the positive offense throughout comedy history has been about systems or institutions that were Taboo to insult (IE. Government, religion, military etc.) The point of the offense was to force a conversation about these systems and maybe start a positive change. Dave saying \"I'm Team Turf\" is kind of the opposite of this. The default reaction for most normies is being transphobic so its just affirming that position. There are jokes you can make about PC culture that pushes the boundary in a positive direction and not the lazy reactionary take. The problem is the comedians would have to actual learn about the things they are joking about which is hard and many don't do anymore. \n\nTL'DR: Anti PC jokes are played out and lazy. Saying its pushing boundaries is false and is just an easy way to pander to get an easy laugh but at the expanse of any positive social change.",

            "In my opinion, America is just at a strange point with how various groups can both bully and simultaneously view themselves as victims, and Dave is basically the epitome of that. \n\nThis was less a comedy special and more just a soapbox for Dave venting about how furious he is that white men (who get much of Dave\u2019s attention/scorn across many specials) can change their gender and be supposedly more victimized than black men. \n\nYou can tell from the way he\u2019s discussed race politics across multiple specials \u2014 (his vivid recanting of Emmett Till killing, for example) vs his how he\u2019s discussed gender politics (just recently figuring out that feminist = someone who believes women deserve equal rights) \u2014 that he doesn\u2019t actually, in good faith, WANT to understand gender politics to the same degree. \n\nI don\u2019t think his biggest beef here is with trans people, but they\u2019re just sort of what the culture wars are focused on as the moment as the people that you CANNOT joke about. And so Dave insists on wanting to joke about them, and is arrogantly insistent that his experience as both an elite comedic talent + as a man living in a marginalized body in America will allow him to tiptoe the line of going too far/being funny/making salient points. \n\nIdk, I\u2019m rambling, but it just reminds me of the saying \u201cIf you come at the king, you can\u2019t miss.\u201d If you\u2019re going to base a special around a contentious political issue, you better be funny and you better really understand what you\u2019re talking about. To me, this special just wasn\u2019t very funny, which for Netflix/Chappelle is probably worse than it being ultra-offensive. And I don\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t funny in a way that I was offended and shocked and turned it off. It just wasn\u2019t surprising comedy like he usually delivers and the basis of it was all points he\u2019d made on prior specials.

They have gotten significantly better since the first Uncharted (which btw, is very very rough if you go back to it nowadays) but the basic loop just was never interesting. I think TLOU2 has great characters and interactions between them, but the basic story is ok I guess? Never really saw what led everyone to proclaim it was the greatest story ever told in gaming or whatever. I found it a little heavy handed with the whole \"Killing people is bad!\" thing especially when there is no choice in if you kill people or not. I think if you want to make a story that goes into how killing others is bad you have to make the player choose to kill and then show the ramifications that come from it.\n\nHaving 2 protags was interesting and honestly I wish they had switched between them more often then they did. \n\nThen of course there is the whole horrid working conditions that ND made their workers go through.\n\nBut in the end caring about the Game Awards is really funny since that thing has always been a joke since it began.",

But it isn\u2019t really, it just means it\u2019s the most consumable.

            "I don\u2019t like the Last of Us very much, because as a big film guy I find the story to not be anything special. It\u2019s a decent summer movie with some very pretty set pieces, but the movie is constantly paused every 20 minutes for some underwhelming third person gameplay. There are so many movies I could watch and have a far better experience. Something I can\u2019t necessary say for great games like DOOM.\n\nI kind of feel like it exists in the wrong medium. It so desperately wants to be prestige cinema. But trying to tell a great story in a video game by basically just being a movie feels very limiting to the medium as a whole. The ceiling of video games should be more than just \u201cworse cinema\u201d and TLOU being so successful makes me worried we\u2019ll see more and more games with that label.\n\nOn account of disliking the first game, I\u2019ve never played the sequel. But it really annoys me that the criticism I\u2019ve been hauling at the series for years now just makes everyone think I\u2019m a Capital G Gamer.\n\nEdit: Grammar.",

I can't even enjoy looking at drama about this because all of the valid shit is mixed in with the vile homophobic transphobic garbage. \n\nEvery single person I know after the announcement was tweeting \"CONGRATULATIONS HADES ON WINNING GAME OF THE YEAR\" so I guess that's the more passive, non-argumentative way of saying \"this was probably a fix\".

            "So I played Last of Us Two this year so I knew what all the hullabaloo was about. I'll say this: if a person complains about the \"social justice warriors\" or \"the industry trying to ram LGBTQ characters in\" then they are stupid and might want to self-reflect on their own bigoted opinions. That being said, I think the story and the gameplay of the game suffered greatly compared to the first one.\nThe first one was stunning, had interesting gameplay and a story that felt heavy. The second one had THE SAME gameplay. Like same items and actions and I noticed that when Ellie stealth-killed anyone it was done the exact same way every time. Also the story ended up feeling like a chore for the full second half of the game. Honestly the best part of the game was Ellie and Dinah's relationship. If the game took a right turn into a relationship simulator without even zombies that started Ellie and Dinah I would have loved it. They're relationship was so pure and beautiful and perfect. Instead I spend hours playing as this lady who killed Joel who I'm probably supposed to get attached to but I really didnt and then Ellie decides to let Abby go after losing a couple fingers and after abandoning Dinah? Come on. From the moment it shifts over to Abby's perspective in the game I felt like I was going through the motions to figure out what happened in the end and in the end I was like, \"eh. Okay.\"\nEven if Naughty Dog had done something like Mass effect 3 (vanilla) and given me 2 or 3 very scripted decision based outcomes I probably would have been happier with the game. But instead Ellie sacrifices everything and murders countless people in order to punch Joel's killer a couple times in the face and then call it a day.",

We knew it would win, and we knew these people would lose their god damned minds.",

            "This is 100% a bait post that will be used as a screenshot in bi/pan lesbian discourse. Here\u2019s some context\n\nRecently, there\u2019s been some weird discourse over \u201cbi/pan lesbians\u201d on twitter and people arguing over the definition of lesbian. The people against bi/pan lesbians are in support of a lesbian being a \u201cnon man attracted to a non man\u201d, while the supporters argue the def is queer attraction to women. This queer attraction of women definition could even include guys too, especially trans men according to many of the supporters\n\nThe discourse is pretty much ongoing with both sides on Twitter competing in a shitslinging fest and has only intensified because the mods of a LGBT wiki sided with the bi pan lesbian supporters. I\u2019ve seen an anti bi pan lesbian gimmick account tweet this one bait post from r/AITA where the OP asks if he\u2019s an asshole because he asked out a lesbian due to hearing about bi/pan lesbian, and this caused a lot of anger among the antis with something that clearly looked like bait (OP of the reddit post participated in lgbt discussion before with weird opinions, I should find the post lol) EDIT: [here\u2019s the post lol](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E7eFpoMVkAENbWJ.jpg)\n\nFor this post, I\u2019m sure it will be used in the drama on Twt since OP\u2019s definition of lesbian (non men liking non men) is totally backfiring on them. IMO, I disagree with the concept of bi/pan lesbians, but the gaining popularity of lesbian being non men liking non men is a bit weird to me because I feel like it treats Nonbinary people as Woman Lite TM\n\nTLDR this is a bait post for bi/pan lesbian discourse as the anti-bi pan lesbian people argue the definition of lesbian is non men liking non men, while supporters of bi pan lesbians argue it\u2019s a queer attraction to women",

He tries to appear as if his views are \"nuanced\" but really he just has no opinion and plays up to the other person on the show. Perfect example was how critical he was of Spotify when the black keys are on and then.....joins Spotify exclusively. On top of that, the last two times I listened to him I was driving somewhere and by the time I got to my destination, he was STILL reading unskippable ads. I pay for Spotify to have no ads yet Joe Rogan puts 10 MINUTES STRAIGHT of unskippable ads at the start of every show. Absolutely eat my ass Joe Rogan , you greedy cunt.

I know the Right wing meme about \"open and honest\" discussion but a few years back Joe actually could have both people like Alex Jones on and people like Bernie Sanders, and have legitimately interesting conversations with both of them.\n\nHe has (had) a very friendly conversational tone which draws things out of people in a way lots of other interviewers don't. He did tend towards a few views I didn't really like in a couple areas but he very much had his own opinions and always pushed back against guests who said outrageous things (Candace owens is a great example.)\n\nThe problem started with covid, it totally broke his brain. It was going downhill a little before but the start of covid is where it got ridiculous. He's gotten too popular and started losing touch with reality. I mean, he always was a little \"rich guy\", having a float tank in his basement and whatever, but after moving to Texas is when he really lost touch with how reality is.\n\nThroughout covid he kept filming and kept going on about his private doctor and how he can get a test whenever he wants, and that led to is anti mask, anti quarantine sentiment. He just generally I'd a very out of touch rich dude and he's picked up more terrible opinions which aren't offset by his previous open-minded and fun attitude towards his guests. It feels like he's lost his curiosity, and that's what really made his podcast good.\n\nThe Spotify deal is just a big symptom, he was going downhill before it. I lurk the JRE sub and have done for a while and the criticism has been creeping in for years already, and for good reason.",

Really bad look. \n\nThat being said, he's not a mayor, or a governor. He's a US senator, most of whom live in Washington DC for most of the year. Congress wasn't in session, and he wasn't needed for any official duties. \n\nBesides the bourgeoisie optics, it really doesn't matter that he left. There was nothing for him to do officially. \n\nGotta say though, AOC was the much smarter politician. She reached across the isle and raised millions of dollars for people who aren't her constituents, and generally don't like her... I guarantee her actions gave her a lot of mileage with Texans, and might have people thinking differently",

            "I'll say it once and I'll say it a million more times, cancel culture is a conservative idea.\n\nEver heard of \"right to work laws\" they are laws always pushed by republicans and mainly in republican states that make it illegal to be in a union and makes it legal to fire your employee without giving a reason.\n\nThese \"right to work\" laws are, imo, the entire reason our economy is so supremely fucked up, we are under this notion that the rich give us the \"right to work\" and we have to slave away for decades in order to just survive. Unions are the things that give democratic socialist countries like the scandinavian countries 22 dollar minimum wage when the government has no minimum wage laws. But the conservative ideology of \"right to work\" actually prohibits you from being in a union and just gives the owner \"the right to take away your income and let you starve on any form of whim\". Unions and workers right actually stop this thing and allowing bosses to have no repercussions for ending someone career results in the scarce and shit job market and economy we see today.\n\nThese right to work laws also are just a work around to anti-discrimination laws. This cannot be explained more and if you don't understand this part idk what to tell you.\n\nSo \"cancel culture\" by definition is actually about using your economic standing to \"vote\" with your money by spending your money on companies and products that you support. In a free, libertarian, conservative economy, you would be able to do this freely. You have your experience and share to others how your experience went, good or bad. \n\nThis \"cancel culture\" for the entirety of history has existed (just think of literally any punishment or fine, they could be defined as cancel culture because they do something and you ostracize them for it)\n\nFor history this \"cancel culture\" attitude has been utilized by the rich in order to exploit the poor due to their \"freedoms\" but now the moment it's turned against the rich and powerful via the internet and can actually have some form of impact on people who aren't dirt poor, the entirety of people are outraged. \n\nThey are outraged people who were untouchable, are now able to be touched, even if it's just a scratch when they deserve a firing squad. For history we are in a struggle of those in power and those not, \"cancel culture\" has just been used by the powerful to put down the nonpowerful but as now the tables have turned, all these stupid shitters who have been exploiting people can be called out and y'all know how much conservatives and libertarians, aka regressives, hate accountability.",

Half the time it\u2019s so they can peddle that all capitalism is unethical and the other half it\u2019s so they can justify their own shitty consumer practices. Perhaps it\u2019s even both some of the time.\n\nI get why they do it, though: it\u2019s easy.

            "As a game dev and POC with over a decade in this industry, I can tell you that this is only the tip of the iceberg for this company. I actually interviewed at Blizzard last year. I was initially excited to possibly work on a franchise that I had always been such a fan of.\n\n(One of the harsh realities of working in this industry is that you don't always get to work on your favorite franchise. You go where the work is until you have enough seniority to pick and choose.)\n\nI can't tell you how disappointed I was during those interviews. Every single person I talked to just seemed so burnt out and disengaged. Most of the devs whos work I had admired had already left the company. Many more were simply let go. What was left was just a collection of demoralized people bidding their time until they could get out as well.  Many more who were just resigned to punching in and punching out to pay the bills.\n\nSpeaking of compensation, its already well known in the industry that Blizzard is notoriously low paying. They have always coasted on the fact that so many people want to work there that they can get away with the lower pay. \"Think of the doors it will open for you in the future!\". They try to make up for the uncompetitive wages with bonuses but every year that bonus check gets smaller and smaller. Word of this has also gotten out and has made it harder and harder for them to attract top talent. Blizzards response to this? Find cheaper labor abroad. Blizzard has increasingly been leaning on low paid outsourcing work to fill their positions. There are now entire departments staffed with \"outsourcing managers\" whos only job is training the replacements of their colleagues. This obviously has caused some internal tension.\n\nI had lunch with the team mid way through the interview day. They opened up a lot more about some issues behind the scenes. They told me stories that were honestly sickening. Harassment, bullying, and discrimination. You only don't hear about it because the victims are usually too afraid to speak up for fear of being black listed. Those that were most aggregiously victimized are simply paid off and forced to sign an NDA.\n\nIts a shame because Blizzard used to be such a respected developer. So many people got into this industry with a dream of working at that place in particular, only to get there and find out it was gutted years ago. The logo still hangs above the door but it's not the same company.\n\nNeedless to say,, I ended up turning down their offer.\n\nTldr: This has been know by those in the industry for years about Activision Blizzard and its only the tip of the iceberg.",

Unlike Gore, Trump has literally nothing gong for him. He lost the popular vote by over 6 million (and counting). He became a rare incumbent loser President, joining other such losers as Carter and Ford. And he lost the electoral college not by a few hundred votes in a single state, but by an electoral margin that Trump claimed in 2017 was the greatest electoral college win since Reagan. Oh and Biden, he's received the largest share of the American population's votes in at least 100 years. And he's received a larger share of the population than any President running against an incumbent. You have to be a pretty big loser to be blown out like that in your reelection.

That's the vibe I get here; OP knows, or should know, exactly what they've done to piss people off, and even hints at it in their replies, but focuses so much on their feelings about being ghosted they don't bother to give the other side.\n\nThe \"missing 'missing reasons'\" post went on further to take some psychological stab at how it's a mechanism for people who place emotions at the forefront and shape their reality to justify how they feel, but that felt a bit psychobabbly for me.

No reason to be upset or be kicked.  Probably not what happened.  \n\n\"I want to roll a religion check to see if I attack the thief in the party after she pickpockets a nobleman\" - Pretty bad, disruptive to play and hostile to the table.  Usually followed by a 'but it's what my character would dooooooo.\"  Far more likely to be what occurred, but usually that just requires a talking to and it's fixed.  \n\n\"I want to roll a religion check to see if my character does 1 whole rape/says a racial slur/some other meaninglessly vile act because I follow the god of chaos/slaughter/lust/what have you.\"  - Most likely what got them kicked from the table, if /r/rpghorrorstories and the immaturity of OP is any indication.  \n\n\n--------------------------------------\n\n\nOutside of the wilder speculation, anyone who admits to side-tracking the game is simply stating that it got so bad that even they noticed (or was warned about it).  Who even knows what the hell that could be- anything from trying to bone-down for way too long and making others feel uncomfortable to arguing with the GM about simple things.  \n\nThe GM saying \"You can roll but you will fail\" is totally acceptable- at best, I'd word it like \"What do you intend to accomplish with this roll?  That's not possible, but on a success, you could potentially discover something that could lead to a correct path.\"  I.e. a high athletics check on a magically locked door and strongly secured door might provide knowledge about the school of magic that locked the door, reveal the direction of the mechanisms that govern the lock, or tell information about the dungeon they're in (perhaps water begins dripping from overhead, implying they could go up a floor and swim down into the room.  Fail forward.  But not every DM can do that, especially with a particularly incapable player, especially one who is confrontational. \n\nBut also, the type of players willing to pay even $5/hr per player are ones who give a lot more damn about the RPG, which is why I charge in the first place.",

It says jartek was removed by the admins after other moderators discovered he was going to sell exclusive advertising rights to True Trading Group.\n\n- The /r/wallstreetbets description [is updated](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/690023781799952494/697323748012982292/unknown.png) to \"Jartek do bad. Ari do gay. Mods no like. Mods tell Admins. Admins no like. Jartek is kill. Ari is kill. Dobby is free elf.\" [Archive](http://archive.is/KzNUO).\n\n- [Haupt confirms what we already know](https://i.redd.it/msyefjcb7ir41.jpg).\n\n- Latest intel: /u/StormWillPass, and probably /u/jartek and /u/Arigold212855, [have been suspended](https://i.redd.it/ugds6egb0jr41.png) from Reddit for a year. [Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wall_Street_Bets_/comments/fx04wc/confirmation_from_ustormwillpass_of_suspension/).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n- There was a mod coup to keep the sub out of the hands of a slimy organization, and now they're private while everything gets cleaned up.\n\n- For \"retards\": Jartek do bad. Ari do gay. Mods no like. Mods tell Admins. Admins no like. Jartek is kill. Ari is kill. Dobby is free elf.\n\n**More information**\n\n- Speaks Booleans' [YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFn5m64rEzQg5_9Acd9tz0kLGhQ5gsPPn). **I recommend this**.\n\n- [A conversation](https://imgur.com/a/HGBW8rJ) with /u/Arigold212855, one of WSB's (*Edit: former*) mods where he admits he's a part owner of TTG (True Trading Group) and that /u/jartek is his \"business partner\".\n\n- /r/Wall_Street_Bets_ went private to make sure it wouldn't get banned for being a copy. It reopened when they realized that wasn't what was going on. The mods are not associated with /r/WallStreetBets.\n\n- /r/BannedWallstreetbets is also private, but this may not have to do with the situation.\n\n- /r/WallStreetBets mod [says they're doing a mass unbanning](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallstreetbets/comments/fwwbwk/wsb_shutdown_venting_thread/fmr1rsp/) of people who spoke out against /u/jartek.\n\n- /r/wsb mod steps down due to /u/jartek's actions.

Someone will make a DD post saying \"buy $60 XXXX puts expiring 4/17,\" then you can go check the options volume and that one specific option will be selling like crazy with an inflated premium, despite the fact that all the options at similar strike prices are basically worthless. It's usually pretty clear that the reddit author is writing these options.\n\nWSB is a fun place. The memes are good, and it's funny as shit to follow. But, it bums me out that a lot of bright-eyed noobies go there, not knowing that 99% of people are joking or scamming, and they get their life savings wiped out believing that certain moves are \"sure things.\"\n\nSure, part of the responsibility is on people not to be stupid and put their life savings in options, but still.

All of that is pretty cut and dried.\n\nBut if the pornography in question is a drawing or a painting or something, I'm not sure who we're trying to protect from being harmed, and I wonder about the legal basis for banning it.  \nIs it disgusting? Sure, but there are lots of things I find disgusting that aren't banned.  \nDoes it encourage pedophilia? I don't know. Pedophiles haven't seemed to need much encouragement in the past.

This is not being shoved into our faces and we're not being forced to watch it ever. \n\nIt's also an undeniable fact that there are pedophiles around the world who watch these things and it helps to suppress their urges to engage in *real* child pornography or predatory behavior which harms *actual people.*\n\nIn reality, is lolicon really harming anyone? It's certainly not harming the fictitious characters nor the people *willingly* watching it. I get why it's controversial, but all in all it's a work of fiction.",

        "selftext": "Some quotes from the [article](https://www.dailydot.com/irl/steam-adult-visual-novel-ban/) linked by OP:\n\nFrom the devs:\n\n>Some visual novel fans believe Steam may be purposefully targeting  not just adult visual novel titles, but MangaGamer in particular. Games  journalist Benny Carrillo claimed Steam pulled yuri (or woman-loving-woman anime) visual novel *The Expression: Amrilato*  by misleadingly claiming the game \u201csexualizes minors.\u201d While Carrillo  acknowledged the game features a censored topless bath scene with a  17-year-old character that could technically meet Steam\u2019s rule against  material that \u201csexualizes minors,\u201d other games with similar or more  explicit sexualized depictions of underage characters\u2014such as *Gal\\*Gun* and *Akiba\u2019s Trip: Undead \uff06 Undressed*\u2014have not faced removal from Steam.  \n>  \n>At the time, MangaGamer implied the issue was rooted in homophobia  against lesbian relationships. \u201c\\[T\\]he only conclusion we can draw from  the feedback we\u2019ve been provided with is that Valve now considers chaste  romance between two women inherently \u2018sexual\u2019 and thus inappropriate  for all audiences outside an adult context,\u201d MangaGamer public relations  director John Pickett said of the situation, according to Carrillo\u2019s  article.\n\nHere's the quote from Valve:\n\n>After contacting Valve for comment, Valve\u2019s Vice President of Marketing Doug Lombardi said\u00a0*Bokuten*\u00a0was  removed after discovering an external patch that activated adult scenes  with underage characters. \u201cIn our initial content review, we missed  content\u00a0hidden in\u00a0the game\u2019s depot that features adult content with  underage characters,\u201d Lombardi told the Daily Dot. \u201cWhile not accessible  in the game itself without an externally acquired patch, we were  distributing that content depot through Steam, therefor\\[e\\] the game  would not have passed our content review. We\u2019ve notified the developer,  and improved our content review process to avoid this in the future.\u201d\n\nSo...pretty clear that Valve removed it because users could enable \"adult content with underage characters.\" The devs went on to dispute this fact but didn't deny the underage content, just that users has to download it from outside of Steam....which Valve clearly doesn't care about.\n\nAnyways...enter Reddit to debate the topic!\n\n[Here's the full thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/i10vid/steam_bans_adult_visual_novel_months_after/)\n\nAnd on to the...erm...debate!\n\n[Well 16 in the majority of the world is legal so](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/i10vid/steam_bans_adult_visual_novel_months_after/fzuastm?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)\n\n[People fucking complain if you change the age by 1000 years.

            "I was on the side of MangerGamer here when it first came out, I follow a lot of VN localisation people on twitter and many of them were furious about this decision because they spent months doing their best to remove the content that's against steams ToS. Redrawing CGs, removing scenes, and doing a good bit of rewriting. So hearing that Steam removed it months later really kicked up a frenzy, however I don't think people realised that some of the content slipped by an was still in the games files on steam which changes things.\n\nSteam has been notoriously inconsistent regarding visual novels as of late, even ones that aren't hentai often fall under heavy scrutiny and since Valve works on a \"one strike and you're out\" policy the publishers don't even get a chance to remove what was bothering them. Not to mention that they for some reason seem to ignore the slew of \"HENTAI PUZZLE XXX\" shovelware assetflips with stolen artwork that DO violate their rules.\n\nIt's just annoying. Whether or not you think it's justified in this case is up to you but it's just annoying knowing that instances like this are going to make jp publishers more hesitant to bring their VNs over even, if they're perfectly SFW.\n\nI guess i'm just annoyed that when valve does erroneously prevents a VN adhering to their ToS from releasing on steam, people are just going to assume valve was correct because of this incident.",

            "> While Carrillo  acknowledged the game features a censored topless bath scene with a  17-year-old character that could *technically* meet Steam\u2019s rule against  material that \u201csexualizes minors,\u201d\n\nIm fairly certain that meets almost all rules against sexualized minors.",
            "Honestly, the dumbest part is that if they just made the character 18 instead of 17 they wouldn't have had a problem. The fact that they made her 17 purposefully just shows there's some fuckin pedo shit going on. Like, \"Maybe this is close enough to get people who are into underage girls off, but not enough to prompt concern.\" Jokes on them, they got called on it anyway.",
            "So I'm not going to defend the game or the developers, but I want to point out that there are definitely other games on Steam in similar situations that haven't been banned. I wonder why Steam chose to ban this one while continuing to ignore the rest of them.",
            "So just like... Don't publish the game on Steam? It doesn't meet Steam's requirements so just publish it somewhere else, like on your own site. It's not illegal in most countries including the U.S. and most of the EU so the only conflict here is that they chose to put it on Steam.",
            ">didn't deny the underage content, just that users has to download it from outside of Steam\n\nI think some people are misunderstanding the consistency of Valve's stance on this. They removed it from their store because it *already contained* underage content. The external patch just *enabled it*.\n\nSteam does not distribute moddable games, such as Skyrim, with underage content *already in the game*. The issue is that the VN already had the illicit content, and Valve failed to catch it. There is no inconsistency here.",
            "I actually was planning to buy the visual novel that is the focus of this post, and since I'm \"part of the community\" in a way, I think there's also some missing context. MangaGamer has been getting targeted by Steam pretty hard, which makes it all that more frustrating when stuff like games that are LITERALLY CALLED \"Hentai Loli 3D\" and blatant asset theft games are still up. Plus it doesn't help with other ongoing situations like Amazon removing Light Novels they don't like off their site. \n\nAlso, if the game passed the review process, why did they come back to it? Yes, I do realize the 18+ CGs were still in the game *files* even if they shouldn't have been there. But what was stopping someone at Steam from sending an email saying, \"Hey, we found this in the game files, please remove it.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI personally don't really give a crap whether the characters are underage or whatever, I just wanna enjoy the story. It just really hurts to see that companies like MangaGamer which are giving us official translations for previously untranslated visual novels are being screwed over by stuff like this.",

            "Well nudity is not the same thing as pornography ... but why not just make the character over 18 and avoid the controversy in the first place.",

And another one comparing it to \"censorship of violence in games by old people\" in another link. *In the context of Steam removing underage sexual content.*\n\nThese are some dense fucks.

            "It seems really specious to me to say that an external patch can disqualify a game for sale, but visual novels are so dime a dozen it's hard to give a shit. \n\nOne issue with doing business with somewhere like valve is that they can decide what they do and don't sell, for good or ill.",
            "Oh man I didn't even get to the worst stuff before bailing, the people in that thread are beyond stupid.\n\nThey refuse to acknowledge anything that weakens their points, even the most basic facts or sensible views just get buried in downvotes.\n\nApparently all scenes from games with nudity or sex is erotic. And if you try to argue that not all of it is explicitly made for the sake of being jerked off to then you're wrong and also something something slippery slope everything will be banned on Steam if that was true?",
            "Everyone\u2019s into different things and I try not to be a hater.  But those games always came across as trashy as hell to me.  I played doki doki literature club when that game was a big thing, and I can see how the genre can be appealing.  But these super explicit games seem like a real freak show to me.",

There is a reason we are moving AWAY from this mindset, while there are some desperate people still trying to cling on like some sad fucks who can't face reality. If they want to go back to the time before EU with your politics, then why the fuck are you in the EU still?

Every single country has issues with domestic abuse, rape, etc. Yes there are specific issues for refugees and immigrants, but it's not like every other people are saints. Also, I do believe a country should decide how many immigrants they want. But when it comes to refugees we have all made commitments to how many we should take.

It's only democracy when things go their way and others become their puppet.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Dude, a Union in this case is a federation of countries who see an advantage in working together because they have similar culture, politics, interests, visions for the future etc. If one country has no interest in this union because the don't share said culture and interests - why are they even in the union?*\n\n*The only reason left is money, isn't it? Why else would you want to stay?*\n\n>*full puppet on western Europe.*\n\n*Sure, because western europe is one, uniform entity with the exact same opinion, just like a dictator. I don't even believe that you're stupid enough to think that, you just went out of arguments, right?*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*When Hungary join the union the government gave significant power of their country away to EU. But they didn't give all away. And the power they kept for themselves they should exercise it as they see fit without EU interference.*\n\n*What's the point of having a political system and voting, democracy and other bullshit if they aren't allowed to do anything and fully governed by Brussels with its dictatorship? As far as I know, the EU deal didn't come with being a colony. I don't think Hungarians are telling the Dutch to how to run their country.*\n\n>*because western europe is one, uniform entity with the exact same opinion, just like a dictator*\n\n*They are the ones who make all the significant decisions of EU. It's not a secret. Hungary, Greece, Poland etc aren't making them.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>*And the power they kept former themselves should exercise it as they see fit without EU interference.*\n\n*And that's what they do. The get critisized because they work against they EU, but they exercise their own laws.*\n\n>*fully governed by Brussels with its dictatorship*\n\n*Again, neither \"western europe\" nor Brussels is a uniform entity. The european parliament consists out of politicians from every EU-country, Hungary too. I have no idea where you're getting at with that retoric.*\n\n>*They are the ones who makes all the significant decisions of EU.*\n\n*Because* ***they*** *are the majority. And if you forgot it: In a democracy the majority rules. A small country like hungary shouldn't normally have the power to veto every important law. But they do. And yet you still cry about a supposed dictatorship. Would be kinda hilarious if it weren't so sad.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit : Linked the 2nd subthread and italicised the quotes.",

            "r/Unpopularopinion isn't even about unpopular opinions, its about opinions that are popular among the alt right, that people want to feel persecuted for having.  Because right now, if I made a post saying \"Microtransaction's effects on peoples enjoyment of games is massively overblown, and games have only gotten better, not worse since thier advent.\", it'd get down voted, regardless of how true it is (Completely btw, fite me), but if I said \"Political Correctness is bad\", it'd get massively upvoted despite the fact that [that is literally one of the most popular opinions in the U.S.,](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/10/large-majorities-dislike-political-correctness/572581/) \n\nedit: Clarity",

A truly unpopular opinion just wouldn't get upvotes, because people upvote for agreement and not for fitting the sub.  But anything liberal would eat downvotes from chuds for \"not being unpopular\" and normal people would say \"well i guess it deserves that because it really doesn't fit the sub.\"  \n\nSo alt-right bullshit that 33% of the US unfortunately agrees with (and many other countries it appears) are popular enough to get upvotes but not popular enough to be \"popular.\"\n\nToo bad there's not a good place to express truly unpopular things?  I guess maybe decent moderation could've avoided this fate too.",

            "/r/Unpopularopinion mod here, in case anyone cares. Before anyone asks, no, us /r/unpopularopinion mods aren't altright , and aren't trying to push some type of agenda in our sub.\n\n\nFirstly, I just want to say that the AHS OP (/u/deceptiveideas) reached out to us exactly once, asking about the popular opinions that often get posted to our sub (and no, I'm not going to post the modmail thread). Young_Zaphod essentially said that he'd do what the users want for the sub, which is to not heavily moderate it (of course, users hate literally any type of moderation because it's censorship in their eyes, you could remove a comment that denies the Holocaust and someone will say that we're pushing a narrative, but I digress). Is this a good strategy? Nah. Do I think he made good points in that modmail? Not really. But at the same time, we get the exact same type of modmail multiple times a week, constantly, asking about why our sub gets so many popular opinions. Eventually you kinda reach the point where you don't really care for them anymore, and you don't have the time or effort to put work into your responses. I know from experience that we don't just moderate by letting the users decide. Because if there's one thing that I've learned from moderating on Reddit it's that the users don't know what they want.\n\nAlso, over the past few weeks, we actually have been attempting to improve the quality of the sub. We've introduced a filter that removes a lot of the political bullshit we get, and then we can manually go through the rest. The issue is, we get so much absolutely horrific posts that it's difficult to differentiate the trolls from the actual idiots, so some posts end up getting through. If you think the front page of r/unpopularopinion is bad, you should see the unmoderated queue. Oh dear god it is fucking horrible.\n\nNow I'm not trying to say the sub is good quality. Generally the sub is very, very bad quality. Due to the nature of the sub, we end up getting a ton, and I mean a ton of sexism, racism, homophobia, etc, etc. We remove most of it, but obviously shit still gets through, usually due to us not being active at the time it's posted (we do have lives, after all, there's always going to be a few hours of the day where nobody's active, it happens in every sub). The way I see it, there's 2 ways to fix the issue. One, we could filter every post and have to manually approve it, which would be an enormous strain on the moderating team (/r/outoftheloop used to do this, and I know from experience that the sub was damn near unsustainable because of it), and would result in less posts overall. Or two, we could make an automod filter that filters out practically all politically leaning posts; we're doing something similar at the moment.\n\n\nTl; Dr, we're very aware of the state of the sub, we are trying to fix it. I feel that AHS OP made some really big leaps in our judgement through 3 messages that young_zaphod sent, but at the same time he wasn't entirely unjustified in those leaps. We are attempting to make the sub better. We unfortunately cannot stop the sub getting filled with altright assholes, but we can hopefully stop them through ***the power of automod***.",

Do I even need to point out that this automatically assumes that actresses claiming assault or harassment are doing so about consensual encounters that they regret?

If this clown gave a shit about female sexuality he might know that.\n\n I'm not a victim of sharia-style oppression because I put a fucking undershirt on when I go to the Renaissance fair- I'm a woman who has fully embraced her sexuality that has decided she wants to wear a fucking undershirt because my tits are for *me*, and if I want them covered, I'll damn well cover them. \n\nIf an artist  decides that *their* character should have an undershirt, that is their prerogative. Saying that depictions of women need to have cleavage to be feminist and non-oppressed has got to be one of the dumbest things I've ever heard and I watched the entirety of Trump's state of the union address.",

            "First comment of the first thread I open: \"censorship is a slippery slope\". \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis reminds me of [this story](https://www.polygon.com/2016/3/28/11321138/overwatch-tracer-pose-removal), which is probably the first time I learned to actually lean back and not give into internet outrage. The Cliffnotes version is that a mother of an approximately 12 year old girl objected to Tracer, an Overwatch character, being given a suggestive dance which flaunted her ass. The mom's argument was that Tracer is a more innocent, silly, childlike character, and such sexuality doesn't fit her character as well as it might with others.\n\nThere are tons of sources on this story, from online articles to Facebook news stories to Youtube videos, and all of them are condemning the mother for \"forcing PC Blizzard to change their character.\"\n\nIf this weren't written in Clickbait-ese, however, literally the whole story is that a mother (and self-admitted fan of the game) made a suggestion to the company that this taunt move was too sexual for Overwatch character Tracer, who is one of the least overtly sexual females in the game. She even suggested the move possibly be given to a different character, someone who used their sexuality more. I like to think Blizzard took the suggestion at face value, and incorporated it. But if you ask the Internet, \"**SJW FEMINIST MOM FORCES BLIZZARD TO CENSOR THEIR GAME**\".\n\nChange does not always equal censorship.",

He answered:*\n\n>> *I would say that of all my books\u00a0Lolita\u00a0has left me with the most pleasurable afterglow\u2014perhaps because it is the purest of all, the most abstract and carefully contrived. I am probably responsible for the odd fact that people don't seem to name their daughters Lolita any more.* ***I have heard of young female poodles being given that name*** since 1956, but of no human beings.[[71](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lolita#cite_note-71)]*",

It\u2019s actually easier to learn Spanish here than English. Lolita is a sweet nickname for women called Dolores. The name Dolores means in Spanish \u201cone who suffers.\u201d It alludes to the Virgin Mary and the suffering she felt throughout her life. The name also means charismatic, sweet, and resilient- all qualities my pup has shown.

I've been an anime fan for more than a decade so I also know about lolicons. If I heard someone call their dog Lolita I'd assume it was a hypocoristicon or they just really liked the book or the fashion.\n\nAnd what the hell was that comparison with Hitler supposed to show?
