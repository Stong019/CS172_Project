            "This is an old story from 2 years ago. A trans male student was allowed to use the boy's bathroom, so he took a pic from inside the bathroom, while violating no privacy of other students, to celebrate his victory. The pic was posted to social media, where other cis male students threw a hissy fit and decided to go into the girl's room to do the same. They happened to barge in on one girl in the bathroom by herself.\n\nNow put yourself in that girl's shoes. She's just doing whatever she needs to do in the bathroom when a bunch of teenage boys barge in for no apparent reason. Do I need to spell out what that could look like to this girl, who has just had her privacy violated by a group of boys who had no business being in there in the first place? She was rightfully defending herself, because she had no idea what they were really doing in there. The school instead decided to [expel](https://twitter.com/savannahmoisan/status/1116817585389989890?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1116817585389989890&ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc) this girl, reversing the decision later that month.\n\nWere the boys blocking her from leaving? I have no idea. The other possibility, one that I think is most likely what happened, is that she was going to leave, when she saw the door open, saw the boys, and went into a fight or flight response, because she didn't know what they were going in there to do.",

I'l give my two cents even if it doesn't help much. \n\n\u2022 The first most obvious thing is that this whole situation has no bearing on the transgender bathroom debate. A trans person was loosely involved and these were just some dudes going to a women's bathroom to be obnoxious. \n\n\u2022 Second, and I really do want to know this from someone with more info, as far as I can tell, the only source from the original article that said anything about the boys blocking a door is the Alaskan lawmaker talking about the event. This would seem to indicate that the whole idea of the boys blocking the doorway is just a bs political move to further the dumbass trans debate.\n\n\u2022 The last thing to even discuss at that point is whether you think the girl was justified in kicking a guy's nads for going into the women's restroom, which really is up to you. I think that it's a perfectly normal reaction , especially if cap'n crunched berries had his phone in his hand when invading the women's bathroom, whether people blocked the door or not. I can almost see the argument that school's have a no tolerance policy on violence, but that doesn't mean that the no tolerance policy isn't bullshit and always has been though. So at face value, in the best case scenario for the guys: a guy walked into a women's bathroom with the intention to take a selfie and got kicked in the jewels. Really doesn't sound that debatable anymore.",
            "I don't know if it's cause I'm an egg or relate in some other way, but these stupid anti-trans sentiments really piss me off far more than anything else. If someone's being homophobic or sexist I can just brush them off as a brainless dimwit, but when people start blaming trans people for something they aren't even remotely related to, it gets me seething.",

As far as him being an imperialist, there is no one in the past and probably no one in the future who will occupy that role that is not going to be an imperialistic killer.  Even Jimmy Carter had innocent people killed.  It was under his administration that the US started supporting the mujahideen in Afghanistan.

Seems kinda insane to me considering it was the US that destabilized the whole region in the first place and there\u2019s gotta be some onus (at least in my mind) on them to try and fix it. \n\nNot trying to engage in drone strike apologetics since obviously a ton of innocent people died but I can\u2019t imagine how a president could navigate the quagmire of the middle east without getting blood on their hands.\n\nAnd also that snarky comment about someone being \u201cscared of ISIS in their bedroom\u201d really irked me.\u201d I may be misremembering but the bombing campaign under the Obama administration didn\u2019t really open up until ISIS started full scale genociding the Yazidis in Sinjar.

It is true that the majority of hispanics do not identify eith the term and an overwhelming majority of older Hispanics have never heard of the term before. But a lot of young Hispanics use the term outside of schools and colleges. Obviously the majority of young Hispanics don't identify with the term but its growing. Sometimes I feel the aggression towards Latinx is to mask people's transphobia and misogyny (nearly all of the people I've heard who've complained about latinx are guys, a lot of straight and conservative) because a lot of the people who are pushing to use the term are Hispanic women and machismo is still prevalent here.

I admire his philosophical discussions and his ability to remain unflappable in the face of aggressive questioning, and to stay on topic. Admittedly, without ever diving too deeply into his political leanings, i knew there were certain things he and i dont agree on, but, like with anyones religious views, i saw them as a personal choice and would never use them as a single all-encompassing, defining characteristic to write off the person as a whole.\n\nI joined his subreddit thinking id find people like me, who were interested in his philosophies and wanted to talk about how they beat depression or found themselves in quitting a job and pursuing a passion. The entire community was a far right circle jerk. It was such a weird experience because i had no idea they associated his talking points with their beliefs. It was all about how schools are poisoning the minds of the young and donald trump is a victim of bullying and how the left is climbing the ladder to fascistic regime.\n\nI was expecting a meet and greet of people helping each other help themselves, instead i walked into a deeply, DEEPLY conservative political rally.",

They have many perfectly valid complaints, but instead the discussion being about the legitimate issues they have with a pandering, money grabbing developer taking shortcuts the vast majority of discussion I've seen is racism/xenophobia ranging from outright to thinly veiled about how terrible China is. \n\nThe Chinese government is problematic and ubisoft is shitting on the game, no argument there.

This denotes a complete lack of self-awareness, and world awareness. People are just clueless.  \n---> And it's hilarious when you think of how many times western games have been censored by their governments (in famous cases even) - and yet they seem to forget this, that games in the western market have been censored plenty times already to appease that market audience (which is partly *themselves* who are complaining about the chinese censorship, ironically).\n\n* people seem to have no clue why companies exist - which is to make money. And not simply 'make money', but make *the most money*. This is why ALL of the games they love even exist in the first place. It was no different then, it's no different now. Adapting a game to appease an audience (and/or laws that are in place in that market) is NOT a point out of the curve. It's nothing new or out of the ordinary. It's just capitalism doing its thing. There are no morals involved in this (there was never any). Just a company trying its best to turn the most actual sizeable profit.",

That\u2019s neither here nor there, though.\n\nMy point is\u2014despite my *personal* political beliefs, 50% of our funding came from the city, 25% from businesses that paid for exposure (fluff pieces, basically). And the rest we raised from events, pub-crawls, and personal donations.\n\nPoint is, I personally knew the creative professionals I managed and content publishing I oversaw, was all made by Left-of-Center to Far-Left individuals. I made our code of conduct and publishing guidelines clear on day one: \n\nNO POLITICS. \n\nOur project, and therefore our paychecks, were drawn primarily from a combination of state, business, and city grants for the express purpose of generating interest in the development and events of the city and surrounding area.\n\nAnyone who was signing to create content for a check from those funds knew the score straight-up, from jump. Left, Right, Center, didn\u2019t matter. The unless the development, business-owner, city leader, feature-subject, or event we were promoting had a political cause *they* wanted highlighted as part of their coverage, NO PERSONAL POLITICS OF ANY KIND WOULD BE PERMITTED.\n\nThere was no penalty for people\u2019s personal social posts, or freelance gigs they wrote elsewhere, newspaper, or local TV coverage of my staff and any cause they wanted to promote. But when they wrote, designed, made video content, interviewed, whatever, for the city promotional magazine, IT WAS ONE STRIKE AND YOU\u2019RE OUT.\n\nYou want to be in political advocacy? There is a wealth of opportunity to get involved in a range of issues, races, candidates, and PACs. We were paid to promote positive content about the City. \n\nWhile you are at work, taking money for a specific job. You do *that* job and *only* that job. Save your UBI and elimination of driver\u2019s licenses rant for the bar.",
            "\n> No they don\u2019t, also not wanting a kid =/=  holocaust. I\u2019m now pretty sure you\u2019re gonna say that isn\u2019t real btw...\n\n\u201cNot wanting a kid\u201d doesn\u2019t even fully cover birth rates, nevermind all of what I said. Why is it that white people committing suicide and overdosing at much higher rates than anyone else is never an issue that the left ever is willing to even acknowledge? Are they scared that they are caused by \u201cprogressive\u201d policies that fuck over white people every single time while dumbasses like Bernie and AOC claim to give a shit about working class people?\n\n> For anyone keeping score, this guy is probably a fascist based on that Hungary compliment. Also 3rd world California? Pray tell, what are you typing this on buddy? Schottky diodes and transistors came straight outta Cali.\n\nYeah, Hungary is TOTALLY \u201cfascist\u201d.... \nI feel sorry for idiots like you. This country is on borrowed time and everything you think you know will get you killed. LOL\nAnd btw, bringing up Silicon Valley and nothing else in the most populous state in the nation proves my point. Even Beverly Hills is turning into a shithole. Nancy\u2019s home is neighbored by a pile of shit.\n\n\n> Oh my bad, lol. See you\u2019re forgetting that we aren\u2019t in the pond you\u2019re the big fish in. Here only ideas matter and it\u2019s pretty obvious yours are half baked.\n\nYeah, so many \u201cideas\u201d everywhere here.... Oh wait, you are serious? You actually think bashing Republicans 24/7 while Democrats literally support communists and terrorists destroying your neighborhoods while they demand that their houses are safe when you have never even had a Republican mayor or Republican House rep qualifies as an \u201cidea\u201d? LOL\n\n\n\n> No, you just parrot YouTube vids. Also IQ is a child\u2019s test and is heavily influenced by cultural factors. The same person can take the test twice and get radically different scores.  While we\u2019re at it, how\u2019s that skull measuring going?  You have to have knocked out at least a couple more since we started.\n\nI remember when you idiots used to insist anyone who disagreed with you was parroting Fox News when you never even watched Fox. Nothing has changed from the pathetic projecting left wing. Funnily enough the Democrats have mentally declined so much that proven idiots like Don \u201cDid it disappear in a black hole?\u201d Lemon and Brian Stelter are considered almost geniuses by the average Democrat now and Democrats regularly quote them without a hint of self awareness.\n\n> My man. If there are 70 dogs and 30 cats, but the legislature is 99 dogs and 1 cat, are you seriously suggesting that it\u2019s canine-icide for there to now be 85 dogs and 15 cats?  Oh nm you already said that it is.  Jesus dude, what are you just pissed that whites don\u2019t 100%control everything?\n\nI love when left wing idiots just pull statistics out of their ass and think constructing analogies based on bullshit statistics somehow proves their point.... \nI remember when I actually had to be careful accidentally delving into some topics that I wasn\u2019t as interested in when debating a leftist, but those days of YouTube personal message debates and public town internet forum debates when you were getting swarmed by cocky and somewhat informed leftists are long long gone.\n\nFirst of all, your 99 to 1 is bullshit and your 85 to 15 isn\u2019t even accurate just in Congress. After Biden it is highly likely Democrats won\u2019t have another white candidate for decades, if ever again, despite currently being the largest political party; just like the Democrat mayors in majority black or mixed cities only are ever white now because of flukes. Let\u2019s talk about the local governments that are destroying their cities like Portland or Seattle or the state reps and federal reps of a state like Minnesota. Let\u2019s talk about how the only way some states or cities have white representation is if Republicans somehow win despite some of these cities and states still being majority white. Let\u2019s talk about how overrepresented black people are in sports to the point that they think the only white players on the field should be black for uniformity sake, along with the coaches. Let\u2019s talk about how black people and black families are not only robbing white people and white families of appropriate representation in internet ads or television ads, but literally everyone else too. And of course, we could talk about how the only guaranteed white character on a tv show or a movie now is the villain(I wonder why....)It is a fact that black people in the western world are the most overrepresented of any race and yet when other races demand more representation it is guaranteed to come at the expense of white people and still it is black people who want more somehow. It is highly probable that in 20 years there will not be a single white person on national television if white people are not afforded our own channels(which Democrats cannot afford to allow). We have gone from almost every commercial being 90% white in the 90s to every commercial being 50% white on average in the 2010s and 2020, and that is not even counting billboards, posters, music, voiceovers etc that are completely dominated by black faces and voices. In reality white people control NOTHING because our representation and power is always negotiable while Democrats have nothing to gain by negotiating in good faith.\n\n\n> Uh huh, statues about what, exactly? (I don\u2019tKnow why I bother,  he never answers these)\n\nHistorical figures? WHITE historical figures from across history in America and much of Western Europe. It is funny how the media can get away with saying they were all Confederates to supposedly smart leftists over and over again....\n\n> Surely, not like the Tulsa firebombing you mean... or the lynwood vikings running rampant, or the Red Summer, or...\n\nOr any other time when we didn\u2019t even have widespread use of televisions or cameras and people were still able to get away with countless crimes we will never hear about....\n\nWhat is CNN\u2019s excuse again?\n\n> Wait, are you using a Dutch colony that relatively recently ended apartheid as your particular example of European diaspora?  You definitely are insane. Brah, that\u2019s like saying that the recent scotus rolling on Oklahoman Indian reservations is a diaspora of Americans in America.\n\nA ethnic or racial diaspora is the members of that group throughout the world outside of their homeland. White Americans, White people in South America, White people in South Africa etc are all diaspora from Europe. Native Americans are pretty much limited to their North American homeland and don\u2019t have a major diaspora, so Oklahoma doesn\u2019t count, no.\n\n> Please, tell me what Evidence I need to show you for you to change. You need only request and I shall provide. I\u2019m tired of chasing goalposts man. This thread is only 4 comments deep and we\u2019re already insanely far from where we started how the hell could I have addressed every point with evidence?\n\nThere is no evidence you can show for me to change because my worldview is based entirely on facts. I am talking about changing your mind. It is indisputable that Democrats and leftists around the west not only stand to gain greatly politically from fucking over white people at every opportunity, but that they actually revel in fucking over white people. There are millions of quotes I can pull up from prominent Democrats and mainstream leftists in the west saying shit so racist towards white people that you would swear it came from the Jim Crow South. Meanwhile black people whine about \u201cdogwhistles\u201d that idiot left wing media people made up. The DNC convention was more than enough proof that white people don\u2019t matter to Democrats anymore with many of the speakers being openly racist against white people.\n\n> The trains and apartments are for the Irish people you dumb fuck. Jesus Christ are you only considering rural whites as \u201ctrue irish\u201d? I don\u2019t know why I bother asking, of course you are...  Just like the intermarriage thing white supremacy puts itself at a statistical disadvantage on purpose to prove a point. Are you saying that the people who live in Dublin aren\u2019t Irish?\n\nDublin is full of immigrants, idiot. It is a mini London already. The reason they are destroying rural lands is to expand cities so they can increase immigration even more.\nAnd why the fuck are you unable to talk about the subject of European indigenous rights without throwing out terms like \u201cwhite supremacy\u201d? Do you realize how fucked up it would look if you flooded other former colonies of England with immigrants you told the people there that they were racists for complaining about literally being colonized AGAIN? White supremacy is a fucking strawman. Black supremacists are not only a lot more numerous throughout the world, but black supremacist theories are basically everywhere.\n\n\n\n> Nazi is an ideology not a race. If someone talks like a Nazi, and promotes nazi shit, hangs out with nazis, then what the fuck do you want people to call them?\n\nNo, it is a fucking buzzword that triggers braindead leftists into committing violence, racism and greater criminality because an authoritarian force that is actually traditionalist can completely destroy the authoritarian left if left alone for long enough. A \u201cNazi\u201d  in almost all cases today in America is simply someone who disagrees with Antifa terrorists or anyone willing to concern themselves with the rights of white people. Meanwhile in Europe a \u201cNazi\u201d is any white person who is foolish enough to think they have rights, much less a white person who correctly points out that they shouldn\u2019t have to give their ancestral homelands to people who come from countries with actual tyrannical authoritarian fascist parties and leaders"

Presumably Marxist economist Richard Wolff, who's latest lecture was sponsered by /leftypol/, is no longer welcome on /r/socialism. \n\n**Update 3:** New wave of Purges have begun. Mods declare not one step back from the cat-eared menace as appeal/protest threads are quickly being locked and deleted.

Oceania has always been at war with catgirls.\n\nalso of interest, I've made a [**Small album of memes related to this drama**](http://imgur.com/gallery/wrBij)\n\n**update 5:** Artist makes [annoucement](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C2Fl9AUVEAAn2bX.png:large) after a day of silence. follow her on twitter [@catgirlspls](https://twitter.com/catgirlspls). Some hack news outlet decides to [follow the drama](http://heatst.com/tech/redditors-embroiled-in-battle-over-the-appropriateness-of-anime-cat-women/)\n\n**update 6:** many mods have quit or been removed. Many new ones and some old ones have been added. some like /u/Detroit_Red/ who have no post history.",

But I quickly learned to not describe myself like that because the \u201cConservative\u201d party isn\u2019t really about small government or individual liberties as a whole.

            "\"Even our moderation team is very diverse!\" I'm surprised they didn't take a page from the donald and claim to have the most diverse mod team on Reddit.",
            "Can someone please explain to me the rationale behind being a conservative? I'm not even trying to be an intentionally dense libtard cuck, I'm honestly curious. In their subreddits and the way they talk about themselves, it seems like they generally try to claim to be the cold, hard, rational \"don't care about feelings\" logical group but I genuinely struggle to understand how they can support their general ideology. There are two points that surely even the most indoctrinated have to admit: \n\n1. Our collective knowledge and understanding of just about every single topic, subject, concept etc has only grown over time. People born 100, 200, 300 etc years ago were demonstrably less intelligent and their societies were *significantly* measurably worse in countless different areas. And \n2. Things chance. Society, technology, attitudes etc advance and progress to the extent that today's world is fundamentally different in a number of different ways to the way it was 100 or even 50 years ago. Just the internet alone has changed just so much about the way that society works alone that it seems ridiculous to even compare society today to 50 years ago in regard to certain topics.\n\nSo given that we can hopefully mostly agree on those two points, how can one justify the general idea of what it means to be a conservative? Sure, as an example, maybe it made sense 80 years ago to have much lower taxes on fuel and lower emphasis on public transport but let's look at what has happened since then in accordance with the previous points:\n\n1. Scientists have since just about conclusively proven that climate change exists, that mankind is contributing to it, and that it is an enormous existential threat to both mankind and the living world at large. \n2. Society has changed: These days the population density has exploded to the point that enormous numbers of people need to travel in the same congested areas. Technology has advanced: Electric cars, great public transport alternatives, better solutions for public transport infrastructure etc.\n\nSo the one point from a conservative that I might understand is that we of course shouldn't just tear up the roads and make cars illegal overnight. People have invested in cars, people's lifestyles have adjusted to them, we don't want to make the market too turbulent for industries etc. However, as shown above, not only do we now understand that we probably should have initially had a different approach to the issue but the issue has also changed dramatically on a fundamental level, so why should we as a smarter society propose the same solutions to different issues which we also understand better? Like even though I understand that we need to be careful about how society progresses, people in those threads were still using the US constitution in arguments, as though it is the ultimate set of logical axioms. That bitch is over 200 years old. \n\nNot only were the people who wrote it far from the smartest people who ever lived, not only did they only have a far lesser understanding of sociology and politics than scholars do today, but also their society was entirely different to current day's and the issues they faced are barely even applicable. They literally have a clause in the constitution that the president has to be born in the US just because they were afraid of a member of the British royalty coming over, regaining popularity, and reestablishing the US within the Commonwealth. Why are people still using this ancient document as an argument for anything? I just really, really want someone to explain to me simply why people uphold this ideology without using any subjective or emotional reasoning about preferring the way life used to be or some bullshit because for the life of me I cannot fucking understand it.",

Butter everywhere.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Disclaimer:** I'm not a native english speaker and grammar might be pretty bad. I'll try my best though!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**PROLOGUE: CONTEXT**\n\nAsmongold is an extremely successful streamer who rose to fame by playing World of Warcraft (WoW) on Twitch. His stage persona mixes some massive ego, exaggerated reactions and [revolting lifestyle](https://i.redd.it/zf9ic70nzs411.png) (he defines himself as a professional neckbeard) with some genuinely witty commentary and fun competitions/interactions with his followers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHis popularity has skyrocketed over the last year. His subscriber count has increased massively, his clips are frequently featured on /r/LivestreamFail and his constant bashing of the current state of WoW, which resounds with a large part of the playerbase, has made him a respected voice on this matter for the community.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**PART 1: TIME FOR A CHANGE**\n\nWhile Asmongold has dedicated his whole streaming carreer (and life) to playing World of Warcraft, the game is nowadays well past its prime. Despite that, Asmongold has consistently managed to rock some serious numbers (around 30K viewers) playing a game which is considered dead by Twitch standards. This is because his viewerbase mostly doesn't care for the game, but it likes him a lot. We're talking thousands of people willing to watch him kill the same mobs over and over for hours hoping for a rare mount drop. That's some serious dedication.\n\nBut alas, the current state of WoW is so bad that even the most dedicated streamer decided it was time for a change. After some months floating the idea, Asmongold finally made the official announcement: he was going to play different games, and he was going to start with the by far most requested one.\n\nThat game's name? Dark Souls.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Annex 1: Thou shall respect Dark Souls***\n\nJust a little clarification here for some context: the Soulsborne (Dark Souls + Bloodborne) fanbase is notably toxic. They tend to treat the trilogy (DS2 doesn't count Kappa) as some sort of deity that you MUST respect and you MUST play the right way and you MUST not use the ways the game offers you in order to make the playthrought easier.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**PART 2: A ROUGH START**\n\nAsmongold started his Dark Souls playthrought the usual way: by dying a gargantuan amount of times and not understanding shit about this admittedly cryptic game. His stream buddy, known as McConnell, promptly made fun of him and everything was great, and everyone was laughing, and the stream numbers were solid, and there he goes rolling off a cliff again, and... wait, why isn't he getting better at this?\n\nTurns out Asmongold doesn't just sucked like any of us playing DS for the first time: he sucked way more. He missed obvious bonfires (checkpoints), he refused to understand basic gameplay mechanics, he spammed heavy attacks to death in a game that's all about timing and waiting for an opening... he was overall really bad. And he was getting mad, and the chat was getting mad, and his subreddit was getting mad, and McConnell, probably fearing Asmongold would eventually give up in Sen's Fortress (one of the game's most frustrating areas) told him about a better weapon to use.\n\nThat weapon's name? The [Zweihander](https://img.fireden.net/v/image/1484/89/1484899940493.png) .\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Annex 2: The meme sword***\n\nThe Zweihander is downright OP in Dark Souls, period. It's moveset has an absurd range, it's damage is waaaay too high for a starter weapon (you can get it in the first 5 minutes of the game) and it scales very well. Most notably, it's a big part of the [Giantdad build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyA8odjCzZ4), which is one of the biggest (and honestly, most stale) memes born from the game.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**PART 3: PROGRESS, BUT AT WHAT COST**\n\nWith this weapon, the game became much easier and Asmongold was able to swiftly storm through it, beating most of the bosses without much of a hassle (while still dying to gravity a decent number of times) thanks to a strategy that can be summed up as \"Wearing heavy armor and spamming heavy attacks until either you or the thing that's in front of you are dead\". People were mad, like REALLY mad that he was going to eventually beat the game using this very basic strategy.\n\nThis was also the time where the cracks on Asmongold's persona began to show. He grew increasingly frustrated, he started to frequently insult his chat and, most notably, he became borderline depressed after dying over and over for 5 hours to Artorias, a boss with a quick moveset that completely countered his slow and inmobile gameplay.\n\nEventually, Asmongold did beat the game, and announced he was going to follow up with Dark Souls 3. Fans were delighted: \"DS3 is a much quicker game! He won't be able to bruteforce thought it! He will have to learn to dodge!\", they said.\n\nThey were wrong. Or were they? Yes, they were, but not completely. I mean, keep reading, I can't create suspense.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**PART 4: A LESSON NOT LEARNED**\n\nAsmongold's DS3 playthought started somewhat successfully. He killed a Crystal Lizard and the Uchigatana Boi, two early game traps for new players, on the first and fifth try respectively. He still made a lot of mistakes, though, and the chat started to develop a toxic routine: If Asmongold failed, they laughed and screamed things like \"LUL DIES ON THE TUTORIAL LUL\" or \"OMEGALUL SO BAD OMEGALUL\"; if he succeeded, chat would spam \"GOOGLED\" and \"OVERLEVELED\". It was really bad, and you could feel it was taking a toll on the streamer.\n\nOnce again, Asmongold chose heavy weapons and heavy armor as his strategy, and most notably, he used a big, frosty hammer.\n\nThat hammer's name? [Vordt's Great Hammer](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/darksouls/images/5/56/Vordt%27s_Great_Hammer.png/revision/latest?cb=20160613005146) .\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Annex 3: The meme hammer***\n\nit's a big hammer that does a lot of damage and staggers and is somewhat op holy shit how long have i been writing this shit i just found it funny what am i doing with my life\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**PART 5: HEAD, MEET WALL**\n\nAsmongold basically trivialized most of DS3 content with that hammer, and people were mad. \"Just wait for Abyss Watchers!\" Bam, dead on the 2nd try. \"Pontiff will surely be his doom!\" Boom, destroyed. \"Dancer, maybe?\" Pew, Dancer got hammered.\n\n\"Only Nameless King can stop him now before the DLC\", they said. And... yeah, they were finally right.\n\n[THIS DUDE](https://cdn.gamerant.com/wp-content/uploads/dark-souls-3-the-nameless-king-1.jpg.optimal.jpg) has no chill. He's notoriously difficult, and really quick, and Asmongold couldn't handle him. And shit finally hit the fan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**PART 6: THE MELTDOWN**\n\nSince yesterday, when Asmongold failed to kill Nameless King after 40 tries or so, things got ugly really quick. [He announced on Twitter that he might stop playing Dark Souls](https://twitter.com/Asmongold/status/1082080766803222529), which was received with massive amounts of criticism on his own subreddit, /r/Asmongold, which has since gone private.\n\nCritics took their anger to another subreddit, /r/RealAsmongold , which is absolutely melting down and where you can find most of the subreddit drama. It doesn't help that Asmongold has been [a vocal advocate for freeze peaches](https://clips.twitch.tv/EvilRepleteLardSpicyBoy), and now that people have been banned left and right of his chat and his subreddit has gone private, that does seem a bit hypocritical.\n\nTo add salt to the wound, [another streamer, EsfandTV, managed today to kill Nameless King after more than 90 tries.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/adg9hz/esfand_does_what_asmongold_cant/) He was a good sport about it, and McConnell ([who was criticised by a very mad Asmongold on stream](https://clips.twitch.tv/GiantHungryPanTinyFace)) cheered for him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EPILOGUE: I CAN'T WRITE ANYMORE**\n\nThis took way longer than I expected but I want to highlight that soon we might face the saltiest and most buttery stream in months:\n\n[Wont be on today. Tomorrow I'll try to kill Nameless King again, if I can't do it, itll be my last Dark Souls 3 stream](https://twitter.com/Asmongold/status/1082351636184481798)\n\nWho knows, maybe soon the flames will fade, and only dark will remain.

He draws critical acclaim by making statements with no real basis behind them. \n\nI've tried tuning into his stream a few times and haven't been able to last more than maybe 5-10 minutes. Most notably was his stream for the launch of BFA when he was going for server first to 120. The dude literally had a team killing mobs for him so he could ride around and turn in quests, barely put in any real effort for the achievement he was going for, and was getting incredibly butthurt when people in chat were chiming in to say another streamer was ahead of him.\n\nPlus his teeth look stupid.",

Whether it\u2019s a Persona for his streaming career or not, it\u2019s bound to attract those kinds of people to his show, and they\u2019re going to act like that right back to him. \n\nEdit: also great write up, thanks!",

He's always been a cheeky twat on stream while offering some actually insightful hot takes on WoW in general. But with Battle for Azeroth being a miserable epxerience, objective low point and and overrall mess, he became alot angrier and vitriolic in his streams, like to the point it became very uncomfortable to watch because it seemed like he could keel over any second from pure rage.\n\n\nI really don't understand how anyone can think building an online community and experience around being an ass (who occasionally acts normal and actually has good discussions) and toxic is a good idea and think that it won't end in an explosion of debauchery.

While Dark Souls II has arguably more egregious issues than the first, the fact that Asmongold was motivated to *skip it entirely* is complete and utter *bullshit*. Even though Dark Souls II had an even worse production cycle than the first one it **does not** deserve that disrespect and still has plenty of quality content to offer despite its flaws. \n\nAnd no I\u2019m not only referring to the DLCs. They\u2019re exceptional but even the base game has highlights. Highlights that even stand toe-to-toe with the other two games, Bloodborne, and Demon\u2019s Souls. \n\nAnd it all sprung up from that hack Matthewmatosis\u2019s hour long nitpicking video. Every time DS2 comes up people just repeat the bad arguments and nitpicking he brought up. \n\nAnd it makes me so fucking mad because I can\u2019t do **shit** about it.

Quick recap before we get to fresh drama:\n\n[Part One](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/hr42ci/rwaltdisneyworld_creates_a_nocovid_park/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) a known COVID \u201ctruther\u201d mod decides to ban any comments showing concern about the park reopening during a pandemic. Sub becomes a safe space for COVID deniers and users are banned without breaking any rules if they show any concern or disagreement with the head mod around COVID. Mods start banning people just for posting in SRD and mods past drama comes to light. This drama got so out of hand there was actually a Newsweek article published about it.\n\n[Part Two](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/hx6my6/disney_drama_update_frequent_rwaltdisneyworld/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) frequenter poster shares a pic of his family in the park as Florida hits its COVID peak. OP DOES NOT like people discussing the safety of going to the parks in the comment. Taunts a healthcare worker describing the seriousness of the hospital situation in the surrounding area. Starts attacking people in the comments claiming they are racist and telling folks to suck his balls. Anyone arguing with the OP or showing concern about COVID is purged by the mods and his comments blatantly breaking the rules are left up. Some bonus drama as OP quits Reddit and takes to twitter to complain about how unfairly he was treated due to racists(?!) on Reddit with no mention of his disturbing comments.\n\n[FRESH DRAMA](https://snew.notabug.io/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/io9fa6/happy_labor_day_from_mk/) OP from the second drama is back after a long hiatus! Looks like he intends to act like nothing happened. A few users bring up his previous bad behavior which received no punishment from the mods despite clear rule breaking and making the front page of reddit on SRD. Lucky for him the mods have his back!! Head mod removes any mention of his bad behavior immediately trying to scrub any evidence of mention that it happened. Comments clearly not breaking any rules are removed and users start receiving threats from mods of permanent bans for not denying reality.\n\nWill update with some individual testimonials with their mod interactions...\n\nEdit: fun fact when this mod gets called out for removing comments that don\u2019t break any rules she usually allows them again and the claims it was automod.

I am more likely as a person to give someone who is openly presenting themself as a woman or fem adjacent a chance when writing stories about women going thru sexual violence.  In the same way I would give more space for error to men or those aligned when writing about sexual violence against men.  This is ultimately just an example, but it's a detail of where it becomes frustrating to be openly lied to on something that is very emotionally charged.

He later elaborates by saying he wants to commit suicide through blood loss in a [sacrifice](https://www.reddit.com/r/morbidquestions/comments/74ru8j/what_are_some_ways_i_could_sever_the_stump_of_my/do0n6cr/) to god. Overall this is probably one of the worst things I've seen on this site, but the drama was undeniable. The users of /r/morbidquestions seem torn between showing sympathy and being supportive to outright anger. These two factions get in fights all over the linked threads. Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger [also](https://www.reddit.com/r/morbidquestions/comments/74ru8j/what_are_some_ways_i_could_sever_the_stump_of_my/do2z352/) makes an appearance reminding users to not be so pessimistic.\n\n\n**Concluding thoughts:**\n\n\nThis thread was difficult for me to get through, there's no shortage of people in there telling him to get help though; which I appreciated but also definitely a helluva lot of hate thrown his way. To the mods: if this post seems like its just pointing out bad behavior let me know and I'll revise it, I've tried to just stick with the more drama related parts of the thread and in my summary.\n\n\n[Here is the full thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/morbidquestions/comments/74ru8j/what_are_some_ways_i_could_sever_the_stump_of_my/)\n\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n**Some other meta threads about this:**\n\n\n- [/r/worstof](https://www.reddit.com/r/worstof/comments/78eyzj/redditor_with_a_severe_mental_illness_seeks_help/)\n\n\n\n- [/r/enoughinternet](https://np.reddit.com/r/EnoughInternet/comments/7509jm/redditor_seeks_advice_on_how_to_remove_whats_left/)\n\n\n\n**Eye bleach:**\n\n\n- [Black pug being nervous](https://i.imgur.com/GnStjlN.gifv)\n\n\n\n- [German shepherd helping a kitten up stairs](https://i.imgur.com/Dj6OKRS.gifv)\n\n\n\n- [A golden retriever saves a baby deer](https://i.imgur.com/I72CeYe.gifv)\n\n\n\n- [A kitten snuggling a bird](http://i.imgur.com/5Ne5GHU.gifv)\n\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\n#   The End",

Why ?\n\nAfter a while I also found this [old post](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/w8vcr8/requesting_rfrogbutt_banned_due_to_being/) and I know how to use reveddit you'll able to see that removed comments were saying the same stuff and also got banned! *(why?)*\n\nI found a [post where some girls were complaining](https://www.reddit.com/r/onlyfansadvice/comments/xu2gy3/about_the_reddit_subreddits_situation_please_read/) because tons of subreddit where gettin banned and also for some reason on of this \"special mods\" comes from nowhere to defend his behavior  when no one talked about it.\n\nIf I'm correct that could be one of the biggest drama on reddit and It could be also make the NSFW disappear from reddit.\n\nMy opinion?In those 2 years that team was gettin models for their agency and promote them in their subreddits and why not? at the same time banning other girls (*competitors*) as I saw from their website 1milliongirls all of their models make atleast 75.000$ a month and they took a % from that (a real  good business)\n\nI don't know why lately they're trying to monopoly all NSFW but the most worrying thing it seems  there's corruption on reddit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: you're able by your self to see how many subreddits they got in the last week\n\nUpdate 6-10 \\*(13:00 GMT-4)\\*One of the moderators, for some reason unknown to me, blocked me.Also, again for reasons unknown to me, they started deleting a few posts and comments\n\n&#x200B;\n\nr/Stacked  Only 25 Posts in 24 hours.

Just follow the trail. Click on r/frogbutts, find phoebs and follow her trail and you will see she is listed as a moderator for almost every sub.

As he was first starting to transition into this well-renowned influencer (early UFC days, beginning of his JRE podcast, etc), his talking points and interviews were very compelling and provocative. But he gradually began to grow beyond those well-intended conversations into what we see today: just another talking head appealing to their fanbase.\n\nAnd you see this happen all the time when it comes to the \"talk-show celebrity\" trope \u2013 either people become the thing that they chastise the most, or they always _were_ that, merely playing a role for the sake of creating content, influencing others, and building a fanbase.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut ultimately, the 'machismo' vibe his content is built upon usually doesn't admit that they were wrong.

We don\u2019t exactly fit the \u201cwholesome 100\u201d vision that Reddit corporate has adopted for the site in light of their upcoming IPO. They have been removing some of our best posts and banning some of our best users for frivolous reasons. Several of our moderators have been banned recently, without warning, for seemingly no reason at all, including the creator/owner of the sub. \n> \n> Reddit is taking actions against us without any explanation at all, either before or after the fact, so it looks like they will probably just take the subreddit soon and give it to their favorite powerjannies, as is tradition. Mr Positive didn\u2019t really care, but now the admins have banned his girlfriend for no reason whatsoever, and there\u2019s no way for her to even appeal. [Here is proof they are two different people posting in good faith.](https://imgur.com/a/pcgxqCM ) [Here is the ban message.](https://imgur.com/a/moj21r3 ) Just my opinion but women shouldn\u2019t have to worry about being banned because Reddit doesn\u2019t like their boyfriends. That\u2019s not very wholesome 100 at all. It could happen to you.\n> \n> Anyway I\u2019m sure most of you don\u2019t actually give a shit and I wouldn\u2019t blame you, **but as Martin Luther King once said: \u201cInjustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.\u201d**\n> \n> We would also like for you to know that we now have a standalone platform with a shitload of exciting new features, for all your cringe and cringe-community needs. We\u2019ve been talking about it for half a year now. Mainly we just want a space where we can have a less serious/more fun environment with content and culture that is not being slowly homogenized with the rest of Reddit. We also think it would help to have a better place to host the more controversial content that we get here. We have been getting brigaded heavily by other subs. Some fairly tame posts have been getting 400-800 reports. And yes, I am serious. If we don\u2019t review each and every one of these, AEO (Reddit\u2019s paid thought police division) takes action against the sub.\n> \n> Come join us at https://cringetopia.org/. It\u2019s shiny. It\u2019s new. It\u2019s really exciting software. You\u2019ll like it. Or stay here if you want. r/cringetopia as you know it is probably over, though.\n> \n> Long live Cringetopia.\n\nAnd to promote their new site, they set automoderator to spam reply to almost every comment on the sub with an ad.\n\nThe whole thing is pretty cringe.",

The meme text says this:\n\n>Top: Me, a Michgander\n\n>Bottom: Watching seccessionist Texans deal with two inches of snow\n\nThe [top comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/ll237c/we_even_have_our_own_electrical_grid/gnn2i4w/) points out Michigan has secessionists too:\n\n>Dude, your seditionists tried to kidnap and murder their own governor.\n\nA couple of comments are Texans mocking their own grid, and a Chicagoan [suggesting](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/ll237c/we_even_have_our_own_electrical_grid/gnniipi/) running the water so pipes don't freeze:\n\n>Some advice for TX from Chicago: y'all better run the water in your pipes or you'll be looking at some in-the-wall explosions. It only needs to be a steady, pencil-thin stream of water.\n\nThe rest of the comments immediately devolve into outrage and self-pity about redditors mocking Texans, including [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/ll237c/we_even_have_our_own_electrical_grid/gnn2v4q/) just five comments deep:\n\n>Haha families are without power and freezing - Take that rednecks!  \n  \n>>Well they were told to upgrade their power system for winter weather multiple times and chose not to. Just like California didn't rake their forests or whatever stupid fucking reason they gave for denying federal aide. I think they deserve help and feel bad for them, but the hypocrisy is pretty bad here. I guess it's good we don't have a vindictive regime at the moment.  \n  \n>>>The interior of my house is currently 42 degrees. My power went out on Monday at 2:14 am. There are no signs that it will turn on again soon. I have 2 children, a dog and 3 fish tanks.   \n>>>The fish and coral are long gone. The kids are cold. But fuck, they're probably hypocrites that propose secession at every opportunity. \n>>>Fuck idiot politicians.  \n>>>This victim-blaming \"lol-look-at-the-cold-people-that-are-cold-Lol-People-are-dying-What-idiots\" bullshit is beyond unhelpful.\n\n>>>>Sir this is advice animals\n\nOutraged [comment thread 2](https://www.reddit.com/user/ilikenap) pointing out reddit's intolerance of other views:\n\n>This is the kinda stuff that makes me hate Reddit. There\u2019s absolutely no compassion for anyone anymore that may potentially share a different view than you. I don\u2019t know how many posts or comments I\u2019ve seen now about how Texas deserves to suffer because of Ted Cruz or because they are a red state. First off, Texas is purple as fuck. Second, there are people legitimately suffering because there is no power to warm their homes. It doesn\u2019t matter that there should have been better preparation. This type of weather is unheard of here, and saying things like \u201coh well it\u2019s your fault because of this\u201d does absolutely no one any good. The focus should be - how can I help? But no, everyone on Reddit wants to just tell Texas to fuck off because it\u2019s what... funny? People aren\u2019t just without electricity, they are without water too. Water plants have gone down and now there is a boil water warning issued in some cities. Unless you have a gas stove, how are you supposed to boil water with no electricity? You people seriously need to wake up and learn some compassion.\n\n>>Exactly this. Texas infrastructure isnt meant for this. Part of it is poor planning, sure, but this is a record breaking storm in texas. I've lived here all my life and I've never seen weather like this here. A whole lot of us use electric heat pumps for heat (which cant handle the 1 degree weather we experienced overnight), and have electric stoves. This does fuck all when your power is out.\n\n>>Texan here, I have been without power for 27 hours luckily we have bottled water stocked up from hurricane season and we had a small about of fire wood to use so I\u2019m fine, I want to say thank you for you comment it\u2019s everything I want to say when I see memes or comments about this and I have not been able to put it into words\n\n[This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/ll237c/we_even_have_our_own_electrical_grid/gnneql2/) explains that most Texans aren't secessionist and hey, it's unfair to judge because nobody knew that weather and climate could change like this:\n\n>1- most of us aren\u2019t secessionists\n\n>2- we aren\u2019t set up to deal with weather this bad, or lasting this long.\n\n>I\u2019m 35, and in all my years I can\u2019t ever remember when the weather dropped to single digits here (looking up weather info, it\u2019s dropped to -7 before, but I couldn\u2019t find where). We deal with dry heat here in the desert, usually 110+ in the summer. We don\u2019t have snow ploughs, no one has tire chains, and having people lose power for 3+ days with no access to heat is a serious concern. I consider us lucky that we bought an older house with a gas furnace that doesn\u2019t have an electronic thermostat control.\n\n>Side note, I\u2019m on day 3 of not being able to work, since my job also doesn\u2019t have power. Wherever y\u2019all are, stay warm\n\n>>First of all I hope y\u2019all stay safe down there.\n\n>>I can understand why there isn\u2019t plows and snow removal equipment, but what I can\u2019t really understand is why your power plants are going off line and y\u2019all are getting your electricity shut off. Like they really don\u2019t have a contingency plan to keep the power on if it\u2019s cold for a few days?\n\n\n>>>That sounds like regulation and Texas isn't into that. They'd rather just under-plan and rely on FEMA to bail them out every time they get burned.\n\nOne commenter shoots back with the recrimination that the North can't handle tropical storms like Texas:\n\n>And the north couldn't handle a Tropical Storm, while the south deals with multiple hurricanes in a season. Infrastructure and preparation is all that matters.\n\nAnother mocks edgy teens for making memes, and suddenly Texans care about the homeless:\n\n>Oh wow people on the internet who are mean spirited you are edgy and impress everyone. There\u2019s a lot of homeless here suffering. But fuck them right.\n\n>It\u2019s not just the homeless. I have a newborn and this is terrifying. Over 24 hours with no power and now 12 hours without water. I\u2019m glad this asshat from Michigan thinks it\u2019s funny though.\n\nSome chime in to try to say they're compassionate, but Texas' governor sucks and people keep voting for him:\n\n>I'm from Connecticut and I have nothing but sympathy for the people in Texas. Heck, I've lived here for 40 years and people STILL don't know how to drive in the snow! And Texas doesn't have the infrastructure or basics to deal with cold weather.\n\n>The person I don't have sympathy for is your governor, who is a completely spineless little ass, first asking to secede from the union and then begging for federal aid in this situation.\n\nOne commenter points out that northerners apparently can't deal with hurricanes:\n\n>And the north couldn't handle a Tropical Storm, while the south deals with multiple hurricanes in a season. Infrastructure and preparation is all that matters.\n\n>>Yes, you\u2019re right, Louisiana has always had an excellent series of non-breachable levees, which have always protected New Orleans exceptionally well.\n\n\nThis gem of a thread:\n\n>\"WE DONT NEED NO COMMIE REGULASHUNS!!!\"\n\n>>Every time I see a preventable natural disaster or yet another chemical plant going up in TX, due to negligence, arrogance, and cocksure stupidity, I can't help but shake my head and laugh.\n\n>>>Texas has no power and people are cold. \"Oh no! Anyway-\" -Non-southerners.\n\n\nApparently reddit's horrible trolls don't care when people die. Also covid is different so no fair comparing:\n\n\n>People are dying and all you fucking trolls care about are the lolz. Already confirmed deaths due to freezing temperatures.. but just keep up the chuckles you fucks\n\n\n>>Thoughts & prayers\n\n\n>>People died across the country because places like texas wouldn't take a pandemic seriously\n\n>>>Fuck off with your blanket statement.\n\n\nMore name-calling of redditors and libs:\n\n\n>It's at least six inches in my yard. Also, laughing at someone else's suffering is bad karma. I hope you have a great day. Dick.\n\n\n>>This is Reddit. Nothing but a liberal circle jerk. It\u2019s black and white with zero room for shades of gray.\n\n\n\nAnd finally, gripes about redditors politicizing the climate/weather:\n\n\n>How sad is it that everything in your life has to deal with politics\n\n\n>>Every single time other states required aid Republicans made it a political issue. Look at the CA wildfires for example. Difference is that Biden will actually help Texas out regardless if they voted for him or not\n\n\n>>>Then dunking on republicans and not an entire purple state would make more sense\n\nedit: post removed by mods",

And that is not even factoring the taste of such food. Being able to make a single dish that most people would enjoy is an impressive feat. Don't believe me? Would you feel comfortable serving your food in a restaurant? Not a gourmet one. Just any random restaurant. Would you?*\n\n*If not, you can't cook. Not really. Being able to microwave hotdogs and make Mac and cheese doesn't mean you can cook. And shaming others who probably have similar or equal levels of skill to you isn't helping anyone. Most people can only make a couple decent dishes. You aren't special for being able to do that.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [A](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/nvjbr1/cooking_is_not_a_difficult_task_saying_you_cant/h140wm5?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n*Sorry, but you're wrong. Again, being a home cook and a chef are different things entirely. Here's a quick list of super simple food you can cook at home that makes delicious meals, and can be very healthy.*\n\n*Spinach salad with grilled chicken Spaghetti with ground turkey red sauce Chicken and brown rice with mixed veggies Crockpot pulled chicken on a tortilla with salsa Teriyaki chicken over white rice Baked potatoes with broccoli Baked tilapia with lemon butter and quinoa Fried pork chops with roasted brussel sprouts Baked carrots with a drizzle of honey (this can be a main dish)*\n\n*Following a recipe for any of these would be super hard to mess up. Worst case is you overcook something a bit, which you can just reduce cooking time next attempt and never have the problem again. Herbs and spices are usually listed and premeasured for recipes. Hell, even just ordering Hello Fresh with everything you already need in the box is still cooking.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Being able to follow a recipe doesn't mean you can cook. Just because I can throw a punch doesn't mean I'm a boxer. Throwing punches and making food is essential for survival. The capacity to do these things doesn't make you unique or special.*\n\n*According to your definition, anyone who can microwave a hotdog can cook. So, everyone can cook. There has to exist a dividing line of competence that separates those who can and those who cannot cook. Being able to cook food that most would enjoy seems like a generous line to draw. Just being able to boil noodles and call it spaghetti doesn't mean you can cook.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*cook*\n\n*/ko\u035dok/*\n\n*verb*\n\n*prepare (food, a dish, or a meal) by combining and heating the ingredients in various ways.*\n\n*Yes, being able to follow a recipe is being able to cook.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Is microwaving a hotdog cooking to you?*\n\n*I'm glad you can Google a word. Can you critically apply those definitions in the real world to get a more accurate idea of what those words mean? Or can you only regurgitate a definition you found off of google?*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I think all you eat are microwaved hotdogs, man.*\n\n*Like; why do you keep bringing them up?*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I could say microwaving pizza or microwaving any food really. It's just an easy example to use when responding to 10 people who don't understand my argument.*\n\n*\"Like; why\"*\n\n*Lol.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [B](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/nvjbr1/cooking_is_not_a_difficult_task_saying_you_cant/h141mtq?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n*You are so fucking wrong and your whole post screams \"I'm a terrible cook.\"*\n\n*Cooking is easy as fuck if you do it more than once a week.*\n\n*Man, I fucking hate your whole post. Fuck your attitude.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I can't cook.*\n\n*I can make a wide variety of authentic Mexican recipes, but I can't cook.*\n\n*Again, not a good response. Cooking is easy if you consider Microwaving a hotdog or burning toast in a toaster cooking. But that isn't cooking. Cooking takes skill, time and dedication.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>*Cooking takes skill, time and dedication.*\n\n*No shit, it's just like any other skill.*\n\n>*I can make a wide variety of authentic Mexican recipes, but I can't cook.*\n\n*Then you have no idea what you're talking about, at all. \"I cook food but I don't cook.\"*\n\n*The fuck are you on about?*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [C](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/nvjbr1/cooking_is_not_a_difficult_task_saying_you_cant/h13xz6x?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n*There\u2019s a huge difference between being able to bake a pork chop with some garlic salt and pepper on it for you and your partner to eat and something that other people will pay for in a restaurant.*\n\n*I\u2019ve worked a fine dining kitchen. I also have aunt and uncles that can cook just fine. I would NEVER serve their food in a restaurant and neither would they, but nobody will ever complain when invited over for some classic tacos and rice and beans or a meatloaf with roasted carrots and mashed potatoes.*\n\n*Home cooking does NOT equal restaurant quality cooking and it\u2019s asinine to think it does. OP is right. There\u2019s absolutely nothing difficult about following literally any recipe from the Internet with simple easy to find ingredients. If you don\u2019t know how to buy a chicken breast and throw a few spices on it then cook it in a pan on your stove top you\u2019re lazy. Period. It doesn\u2019t need to be gourmet, but home cooking is easy if you just take two minutes to search up literally any YouTube video you want to follow.*\n\n*Saying that you have to be willing to make other people pay for it is ridiculous.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*No it is not.*\n\n*It would be like me saying because I can throw a punch I'm a boxer. Or because I can grab someone I'm a wrestler. Punching and grabbing are fundamental skills for human survival. When a kid gets angry he will punch and kick you. That kid isn't a fighter. To be able to be considered a boxer or a wrestler, you need years of training. You need to be skilled enough to teach others fundamentals.*\n\n*Being able to microwave hotdogs doesn't mean you can cook. Being able to make food is essential for human survival. Therefore, there is a skill threshold that separates those you can cook, and those you cannot.*\n\n*I would definitely complain at the tacos you made me. I have the ability to make authentic Mexican recipes that have been passed down to me from my great grandmother. Just being able to season meat with cumin and chili powder doesn't mean you can cook tacos. It means you can make tacos decent enough to satisfy your family.*\n\n*Using your definition, everyone can cook. It's arbitrary and not helpful. Being able to identify those who can and those you cannot cook is beneficial to our society. So we must have a line that divides these groups. Being skilled enough to satisfy most people seems like a generous baseline to divide people. If you disagree, you have to concede that someone who can only make burnt toast with peanut butter can cook.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [D](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/nvjbr1/cooking_is_not_a_difficult_task_saying_you_cant/h14we0d?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n>*Cooking is very difficult.*\n\n*Nope. Gourmet cooking is difficult. Normal every day life cooking is easy. One pot, one pan, a knife, oil, salt, pepper, carbs (potatoes, rice, noodles, bulgur, couscous), some vegetables and some form of meat (or tofu) and maybe some seasonings is all you need to make really nice and easy dishes. Cooking is more than michelin star restaurant.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*No one is talking about gourmet cooking.*\n\n*Again, if microwaving hot dogs is cooking, or course cooking is easy. I would like to set a higher bar, however.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Why the need to set the bar high?*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Not high at all.*\n\n*For boxing we would set the bar this high. For practically any label we would. People just like to feel special and pretend they are 5 star chefs because they can follow a basic recipe.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*By definition, boxing is a person who takes part in boxing, especially as a sport. So even if they are a bad part time boxer, who loses to average Joes, they are still a boxer/boxing, right?*\n\n*By definition, cooking is preparing (food, a dish, or a meal) by combining and heating the ingredients in various ways. So if I heat ground beef in a pan with some spices, I'm a cook/cooking, right?*\n\n*So why the need to scrap the actual definition to gatekeep? To make things more elite? I'd agree if you said someone is a bad boxer or a bad cook, but why fight so hard against the actual definition of what they are?*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [II](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/nvjbr1/cooking_is_not_a_difficult_task_saying_you_cant/h13xlub?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n*Wow someone is entitled.*\n\n*Some people haven't grown up cooking and for them cooking is a challenge. Sure there are resources out there but that doesn't make it easy for everyone not to mention having to get the balls to go shopping for the items and hoping you do it right, and the cost.*\n\n*Not everyone can afford a fully stocked fridge much less a healthy one.*\n\n*I went shopping today to try to make gumbo for the first time. With some equipment it cost over $100 and I have to try to cook rice as well as the main food and I have to cook it for hours.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Wow someone likes to make assumptions about what kind of life people had growing up. \ud83d\ude43*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*~~numbnuts~~*\\*, you did the same thing with your post.\\*\n\n*here I'll act it out since it flew by you,*\n\n*you: if you say to me, \"I can't cook\" then you're too lazy to try.*\n\n*me: Wow someone likes to make assumptions about what kind of life people have. \ud83d\ude43*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Wow you sure like to make assumptions about people's nuts. \ud83c\udf30*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Jesus, I'll edit out the insult, because that seemed to be the only thing you retained out of that response.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*My name isn't Jesus*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*then you shouldn't be handing out blanket judgements.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Lmao owned*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe sheer 'am I reading, wtf' energy from it is just too good.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [III](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/nvjbr1/cooking_is_not_a_difficult_task_saying_you_cant/h153mp6?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n*Cooking is really only easy if you know what does what and what not to mix with what.*\n\n*Some people grow up without anyone teaching them anything about cooking.*\n\n*Sure people can Google stuff and just follow recipes real easy but it\u2019s a lot like other skills learned at a young age. It\u2019s always more difficult to figure out when you\u2019re older.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*It's not more difficult.. old people are most more resistant to change set in their ways and lazy. They are capable of doing it all.. they choose not to.*\n\n*They're like reverse children as they regress. They don't wanna you have to force them.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Yeah, old people.*\n\n*I said older people.*\n\n*Like your 33 year old neighbor Craig, not your grandma Margie.*\n\n*Learning skills you haven\u2019t learned before is way more difficult at an older age than if you had learned when you were younger.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Again this is not because of a biological impediment it is a choice. You're referring to the incredible benefit when you're very young. Learning at 35 is basically the same as learning at 65 it's just 65 year Olds choose not to do it.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*You keep saying that like I\u2019m here trying to defend someone\u2019s decision to never learn how to cook and I\u2019m not.*\n\n*I\u2019m simply saying it\u2019s more difficult. Not impossible.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*And I'm saying it's exactly the same to learn to cook at 25 as it is at 65 and not more difficult except by choice. We're disagreeing, that's ok.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*We aren\u2019t disagreeing because you keep making points against an argument that I\u2019m not making.*\n\n*I\u2019m not talking about the difference between a 25 and 65 year old.*\n\n*I\u2019m talking about the difference between a 10 year old and a 25 year old.*\n\n*Also stop editing your comments to suddenly fit the argument. Just admit you were creating strawmen based on assumptions.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [IV](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/nvjbr1/cooking_is_not_a_difficult_task_saying_you_cant/h13k6y6?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) (this one is my favourite)\n\n*Can you anonymously send this to my girlfriend please.

I\u2019m actually looking out for you.*\n\n*You may think this is a joke now, but it\u2019s actually pretty toxic. I know men who have been married for 20+ years who make similar \u201cjokes\u201d and are completely controlled by their wives. They are always afraid of upsetting her.*\n\n*Maybe I\u2019m over estimating the situation. But I\u2019ve heard these types of \u201cjokes\u201d far too many times. And it\u2019s always from men who are in miserable relationships.*\n\n*That\u2019s all. Just something to think about.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Literally I put this as a joke so people would laugh. Why does every other person on Reddit read into shit so much lmao Jesus Christ*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Congrats. You told the same exact joke that men have been saying forever. Very original.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Yeah and apparently you still haven\u2019t been able to catch on to the \u201csame joke\u201d that\u2019s been around forever. Lighten up a bit eh pal*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*What can I say, I like to question the status quo.*\n\n*I\u2019ve made my case. Do what you want.*\n\n*I\u2019ll lighten up, but maybe you should just think a little more seriously about the words that come out of your mouth.*\n\n*Every joke has some truth to it.

It's kind of ridiculous how easy it is to change your car's oil. You just need a jack.And honestly you could do it without that if you just slide under. Same goes for plenty of house things. Cooking.

There's so many resources available today for everything.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Yeah, tell that to all the mechanics who've had to fix up after what is apparently a simple procedure everyone should know.*\n\n*Condescending prat.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Dude changing the oil is not complicated. I mean like, it's not complicated at all. Thse are all the necessary steps involved. They're detailed in the manual sitting in the glove box of every car sold showing you exactly where they are.*\n\n*The steps are:*\n\n1. *place pan to catch oil.*\n2. *Loosen drain bolt with a wrench after which you can use your fingers.*\n3. *Let oil drain.*\n4. *replace drain bolt*\n5. *fill with oil per normal.*\n\n*You're calling me a condescending prat cuz I think people are okay unscrewing/rescrewing a bolt? If you want to go to the next level of complexity you can change the oil filter too while you're at it. That's a no tool job you do with your hand. Unscrew old oil filter. Screw new one on. It flat out is a basic ass skill that everyone should know.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Cross threading, over tightening and thread stripping, ridiculous placements requiring A frames and other tools a regular person isn't likely to have.*\n\n*No, you're a condescending prat because you're here saying everyone should just know everything you do and do it perfectly without issue or they're somehow failing because they don't.*\n\n*And it's not just in response to this post, it's an overall attitude you seem to have.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Dude please. It's a bolt. lol. Come the eff on. You do NOT need an a-frame to change the oil what are you talking about? The horrors of stripping a thread? Come on. Everyone has the capacity to screw in a bolt. Please.*\n\n*It had nothing to do with me. The point I made wasn't that I was special or super at all. It's that I'm an ordinary person and was able to just pick a bunch of this shit up so others can too because it's so incredibly basic.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*My previous car had the bolt in a place where it was unsafe to just use a single jack. It required an A frame to prop the car up safely. You should really talk to a mechanic about the amount of times they've had to undo the damage \"a simple bolt\" has wrought in the hands of the uninitiated.*\n\n*You really don't get it.. You think you're not special because this is all normal to you, the concept that people don't have the opportunities or time you can indulge is beyond you. Let alone the concept that there's many people that don't.*\n\n*People take so much for granted, then act like jerks that other people don't have what they do.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [B](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/nvjbr1/cooking_is_not_a_difficult_task_saying_you_cant/h13o4x3?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n*I love all these people that say: \"you just have to be willing to learn\"*\n\n*Like the opportunities to learn just drop in everyone's laps?*\n\n*\"oh they did for me, they should for everyone\"*\n\n*Well they didn't, no matter how much they should have.

            "I love cooking and think basic cooking is pretty easy, but I try not to project my own experiences onto other people and try to understand their perspective. When someone says they can't cook, I interpret that more as them saying: \"I have high anxiety over the possibility of failure and having to live with the results of that failure\". If you make a mistake you've wasted time, money, and you're either still hungry or have to eat something unappealing. That can be a stressful idea to a lot of people, so they quit before they even try. \"Avoidance\" is a coping mechanism to deal with stress.\n\nTake for example, computer literacy. Growing up with computers in the late 90's/early 2000's I always thought it was strange that the adults in my life couldn't do the most basic things with computers. It's not hard to learn, I thought, and these adults aren't stupid. Just click around and see what pressing different buttons does! What I eventually realized is that these adults had high anxiety about \"breaking\" something on the computer that they wouldn't be able to easily fix. Kids aren't really worried about breaking things (that's what they do!) so they have far few reservations about clicking that mystery button, and because of that, learn computers early and quickly. I believe computer literacy and cooking skills are similar in that the biggest barrier to learning is stress.",

These are the things you learn IF you mom or dad knew and happened to want to teach you or IF you picked up the elective or IF you needed to learn it to survive. It is NOT THE STANDARD to know these things. So while on a micro level you not incorrect that any given individual that may not know any one of these particular skills should know them. To take such a position that anyone is lazy is essentially ignoring the entire complicated nature of growing up in American culture. You are disregarding macro to focus on the micro and being an ass in the process. \n\nConsider this: you can pull a list of all those \"its so easy you're lazy if you dont know\" skills and pick out a random person.

All with the expressed purpose of stopping the certification of the election of the President. not a coup not violent.. get fucked moron.\n \n> Didn't say it wasn't violent, but the capital rioters were definitely less destructive than what we've seen since last May.

            "I don't get it. Literally nothing about this sub is saying that games are inherently bad, or that gamers should stop gaming. Anything can become addictive or compulsive. When did gamer culture become so overly sensitive to every little thing? Its just like trying to talk to people about realistic female characters or the inclusion of minorities in gaming. Everytime anyone raises a genuine issue within the culture or the industry it seems thousands of angry gamers reach for their keyboards and pitchforks to tell people how awful they are for trying to ruin games for everyone and how dare they brutaly attack them and their pass time. No one is attacking anyone. No one wants to take games away from us. Nothing is perfect. Gaming is no exception to that. And we all know that gaming has had and continues to have its fair share of controversy in the past when people genuinely have tried to restrict the selling of games, accuse games of inciting violent behaviour in children, deny that games can be a medium or artistic expression and etc. But come on, don't you think that in the wake of real attacks on gaming, we are now perhaps a little over sensitive when it comes to these things? To the point where people can't even tolerate the thought that some other people might not like games. This is pathetic. We are not a comunity of angry, short temperd children.  We are mature grown ass adults. You do a disservice to this entire community, and its people like you with your endless childishness and vitriol that will undo all the progress we've made and return us to the days when video games were thought of as nothing more than playthings for children.",

Plenty of times I could have done better at school because I was playing a certain game too much and hell even an epileptic seizure I had was attested to be caused by flashing images on a game.\n\nPoint is, helping people stop playing games because it conflicts with real life problems is a good thing.

Before he did, he leaked all the moderator chat logs for that subreddit, from 04/19/2018 - 01/06/2019.\n\n\n[Full chat logs](https://lsfmodspepega.github.io/)\n\nThe leaks revealed that the LSF moderators have been attempting to dox one of Ice Poseidon's web developers. [Said dev is banned on LSF.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ice_Poseidon/comments/ads64k/top_lsf_modscreators_docksing_ice_developers/)\n\n[Link to dox attempt here:](https://imgur.com/a/UPC0K9K) \n\nThe Target of this has said this was because he started the /r/LiveFails subreddit.

Any questioning of this leads to a ban. Theory outlined [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ice_Poseidon/comments/a11wzl/lsf_mods_saw_djs_post_on_top_of_the_sub_and/), where a clip of IP friendly streamer DjPanz was removed.

[Which can be found here](https://imgur.com/a/Hi3LRQk)\n\nI want to thank the moderators of /r/SubredditDrama for helping my improve my post and making sure it is in line with the rules of this subreddit.\n\nAlso a thanks to /r/Ice_Poseidon and /r/IPCJ for finding some of the info in this leak.\n\nPlease post comments below as the leaked DM's are massive in quantity and there is probably some information that I missed\n\n\nAs of right now, 3 moderators have left the team on /r/livestreamFail yet there has been no official response\n\nUPDATE: A LSF Moderator shown in various screenshots has responded to claims in an IP thread in which he defends his actions, admitting that he did doxx someone, for \"sending him a threatening PM\" [Reddit Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ice_Poseidon/comments/ae9o3m/1_of_the_mods_implicated_in_lsfs_efforts_to_doxxx/edngzvk/)\n| [Imgur Album](https://imgur.com/a/lQJaePf)",

(The Cx network are a group of livestramers based on youtube who work together). A lot of people who read this post may not understand the amount of cultural influence /r/LiveStreamFail has on the streaming world. Getting a clip of your stream to that top of that subreddit ensures 100s to 1000s of new viewers. They were purposely trying to suppress an entire group of streamers (most of whom had never broken any rules) because they don't like the dude who runs the network they're on. The LSF subreddit has 400k subscribers. That's an insane amount of influence that is 100% being manipulated.

            "I want to apologize for my negative behavior in all of this, but I put the logs out with my own communications to make myself equally culpable. I try to be very thoughtful about my actions and behavior, but it can be difficult to keep that mentality when you have (internet) power and are communicating in a private setting, but that doesn\u2019t make it any more correct. My intent may have been correct or not malicious to myself alone, but intent generally only matters to the person committing the action, or making the silly racist joke or moderating decision.\n\nThe goal of this all was to get ImNatt and Kebab removed as moderators at the very least, if not wipe the entirety of the mod-team as it is mostly inactive aside from myself, and I was being forced to compromise on poor moderation decisions and rules, usually under the threat of \u201cstop arguing, we\u2019re the seniors and we\u2019ll remove you as mod\u201d in PM\u2019s. Being told that while being the most active moderator who gave a shit about the subreddit was really starting to take a toll on my mental state. The last day or two in the logs was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back for me.\n\nFrankly, I forgot about all of the doxing and other contentious stuff, but I still should have done more to prevent it. It\u2019s difficult to speak up when you\u2019re the bottom guy though. I suppose it comes down to if it\u2019s okay to doxx people privately with the intention to not share it publicly. That will likely be a personal decision for people evaluating this situation though. It\u2019s certainly more on the side of being the wrong thing to do overall though. \n\nHonestly, the rest of the moderation team aside from the two that I mentioned are generally very nice, good, and reasonable people, including Raptor. (Chanman has an\u2026 interesting history but you\u2019ll have to take my word he was always a kind, friendly person for the most part. He\u2019s been missing for 6 months now though). As I mentioned above, I think perhaps all of us let the power and anonymity of moderation and what were private Discord logs affect our decision making. \n\nThis is getting rambly so I\u2019ll try to wrap this up. I hope LivestreamFail is improved as a result of this, since I have genuinely cared about the community and tried to make it the best I thought it could be for the past 8 months, and have poured a lot of time and effort in to it. I probably should have handled this differently or spoken privately to some of the other mods about changing the mod culture / getting some of the inactive / toxic moderators removed, but hindsight is 20/20. I\u2019ve felt fairly helpless for the past month or so, and I don\u2019t like feeling such negative emotions over something as ultimately pointless as internet moderation. \n\nI hope at the very least other moderation teams learn from this. \n\n---\n\nPS: /u/Good_Guy_Dev had absolutely nothing to do with this, he just runs the mirror site and doesn\u2019t really communicate with the mod team. He is a legitimate saint of a person. \n",

Before, between 2015 and 2017, Ashooh was Deputy Director of the Atlantic Council's Middle East Strategy Task Force, working directly with and under Madeline Albright and Stephen Hadley. As Bill Clinton's secretary of state, Albright oversaw the Iraq sanctions and the Oil for Food Program, denounced as \"genocide\" by the successive United Nations diplomats charged with carrying them out. In an infamous interview with 60 Minutes. Albright casually brushed off a question about her role in the killing of half a million children, stating \"the price is worth it.\" Meanwhile. Hadley was deputy or senior national security advisor to the government of George W. Bush throughout the Afghanistan and Iraq invasions, surely the greatest crimes against humanity thus far in the 21st century.\r  \n\r  \nAshooh appears to be as hawkish as her bosses. Her particular area of expertise is the war in Syria, regarding which she has been among the most belligerent voices, constantly calling for more American intervention to overthrow the government of Bashar al-Assad. In a 2015 interview with AlJazeera, she praised the U.K. government's decision to bomb the country, claiming that the British public was \"coming around\" to the idea of war. A shocked interviewer asked \"how will the British airstrikes \\[on\\] Syria...make the British public any safer?\" Ashooh replied that it was \"generally a positive decision\" because \"it goes a long way in improving international consensus on the way forward on Syria,\" although she lamented that there wouldn't be \"much improvement in the situation without ground troops.\" There will be \"no political solution without a military element,\" she predicted, essentially making the pitch for war.

It's a hot button issue what the fuck did he/yall expect?",
            "So I will pitch in as both a person who was very interested in this game from it's announcement and have both seen the mechanics (current state which is VERY rough) in action along with having played \"legacy\" games such as SWAT or Rainbow Six (Original series such as Ravenshield).\n\nThis game is so far from offensive in that particular level design. MW2's \"No Russian\" is FAR more offensive if we are going along that route. That level pretty much encourages the shooting wholesale of civilians for pretty much no gain (however I understand that it was very important to the storyline and it's a damned videogame that is flagrantly fake so I don't freak out over it).\n\n\"Ready or Not\" would in this instance have you playing in a PvE scenario as an actual SWAT unit. That is to say SWAT in real life is a LIFE-SAVING unit; they are not there to go \"shoot the bad guys\". They are there to use their extensive tools and additional training to force a suspect to surrender due to overwhelming force or if absolutely necessary eliminate a suspect if they are a serious threat to innocents. There would be ZERO PvP in that instance and I see that the detractors have zero understanding of what is a very niche and incredibly complex set of game mechanics. \n\nLet's Break it down: \n\nPart 1: Dynamics of survival\n\nThis game is VERY realistic. If you stand in a doorway there is a good chance you will die. One shot from a firearm in game can and will absolutely kill you. You aren't just using a pistol like James Bond; you are making full use of a SWAT team arsenal. That is to say no frag grenades, but plenty of cameras, drones, 9 bangers, etc. Basically much like SWAT 4 you have an equal number of lethal and non-lethal options available for each team member to use. I would say about 80-90% of a level is setup and planning with the remainder being the actual moments where you secure a suspect. In total of lets say a 15 minute game you might spend about 1 minute actually \"in the action\". And in seconds you can win or lose a match. The dynamics are very unforgiving and go from 0-100 real quick.\n\nPart 2: Shoot No-Shoot\n\nOne fundamental mechanic nobody here seems to understand is that this game (much like SWAT 4) actively punishes you for \"run and gun\" game play. In some cases you aren't even supposed to shoot an armed suspect unless your TOC declares them hostile. It is absolutely something that incentivizes the usage of non-lethal methods (and rewards players as such) very much like how SWAT units normally work. In the case of a school shooter level if you go John Wayne and waste the guy before even trying to make him surrender you absolutely get punished for it. In real life they didn't waste the Dallas shooter until after they had tried negotiating with him for almost 4 hours. Now obviously you won't actually die but the game is designed from the get go to push players towards finding ways to secure as many suspects as possible. And it absolutely will force you into a shoot no-shoot scenario when you enter a room if you can't see certain things which, again, will punish you if you make the wrong choice.\n\nPart 3: Playerbase and Application\n\nNow I can safely say this isn't some MW2 shock value level and this isn't GTA or Manhunt where you do very illegal or crazy shit. As for the playerbase I can't speak to everyone but a lot of the guys who I interact with that are interested are not there to jerk off to dead kids. Most of us are notably older (I am one of the youngest being in my mid-20's) and several of us met at a very serious shooting course/TECC. I think I can speak for a few of us and the reality is very simple: I don't care for the arbitrary political influence being exerted for clicks and I don't like arbitrary outside interference without knowledge or context. Kotaku wrote that article as clickbait because they absolutely are a bag of dicks. But some of the communities response has been inappropriate. However I would point out how extremely inflammatory and unnecessary the article was and how it took the ENTIRE game out of context. In game you would be acting as part of a life-saving unit; not Rambo blowing up a school. And the drama and attention it has attracted HAS brought a cesspool of morons who fundamentally have zero experience with such a niche game (it is beyond complex) and have devolved into arbitrary cancellation because \"reeee\" over something that is fundamentally not understood by them. Reading a shitty article does not entitle someone to understand the game in its entirety just like how reading a shitty facebook article doesn't make you an expert on fucking vaccines.\n\nTo anyone who bothered to read this I highly recommend playing SWAT 4 or the Original Rainbow Six if you want any idea how niche and complex this game is. I am not here to go \"hurr my game is complex so I am better\", I am just pointing out proper context which makes the level much more in-line with what the Dev's are trying to achieve. It's like trying to properly min-max a division in HOI4 but instead of crunching numbers on industrial work you're considering if a flashbang and a 40mm beanbag will force a guy to drop his gun. Also HOI4 is also kickass but way too addicting.",
            "It\u2019s not really a genre that I\u2019d play, but I wouldn\u2019t necessarily have any real objections to the idea.\n\nHowever, you\u2019d have to be pretty damn obtuse to not realise how terrible the optics would be and why the publisher wouldn\u2019t want to touch it with a barge pole. \n\nThere\u2019s probably someone out there planning on a mod to let you play as the shooter already. The \u201cVideo games bad! Think of the children!\u201d Lobby is pretty bipartisan and would be all over this, as well as the media, hoping to grab some easy views. All it would take would be for one of America\u2019s Next Top Shooters to be found to own a copy of it and the publisher would be in a world of shit. Even with the potential publicity boost that a big controversy would bring, it really wouldn\u2019t be worth it for them.",
            "This is a fake drama.\n\nNobody knows why devs and Team 17 split. Remember that whatever deal they had probably involved money so it's not something that happened overnight.\n\nKotaku article is just a clickbait like all Kotaku articles and nobody blames kotaku for anything. Kotaku wrote their article after Team 17 split and even Kotaku have no idea why that happened. They are speculating because it's Kotaku. Kotaku has nothing to do with actual journalism.\n\nWhile school shooting scenario is controversial it depends on how devs handle it. Remember that Ready or Not is not a game that promotes violence. You are actually penalied for using it. You can't just shoot a civilian. You can't even shoot a perp if he just holds a gun. \n\nBasically you fail school shooting incident if you hit a baystader. Or you shoot the suspect when he or she is not a threat.\n\nFinally - remember that Read or Not is released globally. And school shootings mostly happen in America. So just because Americans are upset because someone touch this topic does not mean it should not be touched.\n\nThis scenario can also show people what is going on during that scenario. It might make people talk. So i think it will do more good than bad.\n\nAdvice for Americans: instead of being upset that someone is showing your problems - they to do something about those problems.",

            "I'm a nobody, and my opinion on this matter is irrelevant, but I'm going to share it anyway.\n\nMy understanding of this situation is based almost entirely off of this link shared in another thread: https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/JonTron. \n\n----\n\nSo, I've watched JonTron for a while. I liked him on Game Grumps, and I've liked what he has made on his own channel.\n\nWhen the drama rose up around him a while back when he was on stream with Destiny (or podcast or whatever it was), I was bummed. It sucks when a content creator you like turns out to be a racist or misogynist or whatever kind of shitty person people can be. I was bummed when I found out Orson Scott Card is a racist. I was bummed out when I found out Kevin Spacey is a sexual predator. \n\nWhen JonTron came out with a response, taking back some of what he said, I was all too eager to forgive him. I wanted to believe that he didn't really hold white nationalist views; he was just arguing, poorly, that people should be able to discuss some of these topics without immediately being labeled a racist. Alright... That's a bit... Iffy?... But I guess I can see the point from a purely Free Speech sort of view.\n\nI had basically put it all out of my mind until today, when I came across this post.\n\nSo, earlier today, I see JonTron on my YouTube feed. I'm excited. I watch the video. I get some laughs. Everything is fine.\n\nThen I come across this post, and read through the sub-posts. I figure, _Ah, people just can't let that thing go, can they. He retracted what he said._ But as I read through it, I see some references to stuff I don't recognize. His tweets, or comments with Sargon of Akkad.\n\nThen I come across this link: https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/JonTron. I read through it all, and I'm just more and more disappointed.\n\nAnd now I'm at the point where I have to accept, _No, JonTron has swallowed that alt-right propaganda, hook, line, and sinker._ I'm still shocked, because, as is mentioned on that RationalWiki link, he seems otherwise progressive.\n\n> Jafari has provided a cautionary tale in how alarmingly effective alt-right propaganda has become in recent years, especially considering Jafari is someone who has done the following:\n>\n> * Voted for\u00a0Barack Obama\u00a0twice\n> * Used to support\u00a0Bernie Sanders\n> * Happily uses a person's preferred pronouns\n> * Voted in favour of\u00a0same-sex marriage\n> * Is the child of two immigrants\n\nI don't think JonTron is the sort of \"deep hatred\" racist that would approve of racial violence or anything like that, but I do think he is this sort of unknowing racist, a corrupted rationalist who has bought into a lot of lies and manipulation that were designed as veneer to cover up racism. I think he was duped like a lot of other people in this country who voted for Trump. Fascists have been using these propaganda tactics for generations, and they are frustratingly effective.\n\nI hope that JonTron, and almost half of America, can realize they have been deceived before it's too late (if it isn't already). \n\nSo, once again, I'm bummed because there is yet one more content creator whose media I like, but now I don't get to enjoy because I don't want to support toxic views and behavior.

I paid attention, cared, and used my vastly expanded knowledge of the political sphere to form new thoughts. And, well, they\u2019re racist. I hate that word, \u201cracist\u201d. It\u2019s used so loosely nowadays, and I barely pay attention to it anymore. What Jon said, however, about preserving the gene pool (among other things), hurts. I\u2019m white, but I have quite a few differing races flowing through me. My ancestor worked hard to get here, and it hurt me to hear someone I look up to say those things.\n\nI think Jon\u2019s a great comedian, and I will always hold his past work dear, but, just like films with Kevin Spacey that I love, they\u2019re tainted. Hate to say it, but I don\u2019t even think a proper apology where he systematically goes through each and every statement to amend them would help, because I feel like it\u2019d be disingenuous after such a long time.

The irony, of course, is that the response to the pandemic is political, and the pandemic itself has been politicized. This leads the sub to the hair's breadth discussion zone of a virus but not how we respond to it. As a result, they have a long standing policy of locking threads covering the daily briefings (when they had them), discussions on policy, even presidential demands to decrease testing. IDK, seems relevant to me and most posters on the sub. Mods just seem to think people are capable of discussing the horrors of 130,000 dead Americans, but not how we got to this point or how to avoid another 100,000 dead Americans.

It's being marketed as a spiritual successor to the well-loved *Fallout: New Vegas*. Fans of the *Fallout* series were very excited for it.  \n\nEpic is the company behind *Fortnite*, and lately, they've been establishing themselves as a storefront for digital PC games, competing against Steam by securing one-year exclusivity deals for several highly anticipated upcoming games by offering publishers and developers a bigger revenue cut and (in some cases) upfront cash. Gamers do not like the Epic Games Store due to a number of reasons, including the lack of certain features, security issues, and simply not being Steam. There is also the fact that many of these games were originally advertised on Steam, only to be pulled very late, implying that Epic swooped in at the last minute to buy exclusivity. [The Epic Game Store has appeared on SRD a few times already](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/search?q=epic+store&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all).  \n\nToday, *The Outer Worlds* has just been announced as one of several upcoming PC games that will release on the Epic Store first, followed a Steam release a year later. In TOW's case, it's not quite exclusive, as it will launch of both the Epic Games Store and the Windows 10 store.

Just because \"they're\" not exposed yet or talking  about it, doesn't mean it isn't already happening. What's even more  laughable is that your info isn't really that precious to anyone.  Someone on YouTube made an excellent exposition of how your ID info,  PayPal or credit card info being leaked from an online store is more  harmful to them than any (if any) short-term gain they might get. Want  to be safe? Don't put personal stuff on your social media accounts. Now  that's what people should be worried about. (The recent senate hearing  with Facebook's Mark Zuckerburg are just the tip of the big, scary  iceberg.)\n\n\u200b\n\n**2. Epic Game Store customer service was professional and treated me well**\n\nI pre-ordered Metro Exodus on EGS. Less than a day later, they  announced regional pricing. I asked for a partial refund as per their  own announced statement of automatic partial refunds but for some weird  reason the rep said she can't do it (Weird?!). So, angry me asked  politely to have a full refund since the game isn't even out yet and  that's within my rights. They did it. Within the hour. Every single time  they replied to me was within two hours at most of me sending them a  support ticket and/or email. That is something I cannot say about Steam.  Steam is ... Steam when it comes to customer service or changes or  anything at all. By the way, I ended up buying the Gold Edition of  Exodus on their store, because point #3.\n\n\u200b\n\n**3. Epic Game Store has regional pricing**\n\nThis is incredibly important. I cannot stress it enough.\n\nSteam doesn't allow regional pricing for my region.\n\nUplay >>a store I love by the way because they're the same  awesome people who brought me literally thousands of hours of  entertainment through terrific games for years (For me: Assassin's Creed  series, Far Cry series, Splinter Cell series, Rayman Legends, Valiant  Hearts, The Division 1 & The Division 2)<< doesn't have  regional pricing for my region!\n\nLo and behold! Epic has regional pricing. Want Metro: Exodus Gold  Edition for almost half the price on Steam (and don't care about cards  or achievements)? You got it!\n\n\u200b\n\n**4. Steam got too big and too stale**\n\nMonopoly is never a good thing and Steam has created a soft monopoly  on games. Being the online library where all your games are REGARDLESS  OF PLACE OF PURCHASE makes Steam into a draconian entity. What happens  if/when they have technical problems, change in the board of directors,  sold away, ...? It baffles me that this is never brought up.\n\nEver heard of the saying, Don't put all your eggs in the same basket?  Well, Epic is yet another basket I can put my games in, which gives me  more ease of mind.\n\n\u200b\n\n**5. Justice for developers/store hybrids**\n\nSteam is a seller/intermediary and game library that we are forced to use. Polished, yes, but they do NOT create games.\n\nUbisoft actually creates games. Super entertaining and gorgeous games, too.\n\nEpic creates games, Fortnite is not my cup of tea but it's theirs. Unreal engine is theirs too btw.\n\nHow is it okay that someone who has nothing to do with creating games  twists the arm that feeds it, so to speak?! Taking a huge third of the  profits for showcasing games and storing them on servers and  maintenance?! Hmmm Well, the business types in companies that actually  create or at least help create games finally had enough with this ...  whatever it's called. Good on them.\n\n\u200b\n\n\\[/rant\\]",

Some highlights (please note this is just highlights, there's a lot more back and forth on the original post): \n\n_______\n[Drama thread 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/ljpi27/id_like_to_live_debra/gnfctub/)\n\n> She could have did that in private. Some people like me are very squeamish about needles. Makes me feel faint and triggers panic attacks. I know I'll get down voted for this. *(Editor's note: this prediction was quite accurate, sitting at -209 at the moment)*\n>> I feel like their discomfort is not outweighed by the diabetic\u2019s literal right to stay alive, which is kind of the point of the post lol\n>>> smh/...I am not saying that she doesn't have the right to stay alive, but does that mean they should just do it anywhere they want without warning others like me? Panic attacks usually put me in the emergency room. I do feel for people who have to deal with illness, but they should also understand that there are others with conditions or phobias too, and should consider that before whipping out a needle without warning. A warning would have been considerate.\n>>>> Well don't you live in a nice little world that's all about you? So special!  \n>>>>Youre talking about your panic attacks and how maybe being squeamish would trigger that. You realize you're comparing that to type 1 diabetes???  \n>>>> Your lack of perspective and empathy is really shitty. Shut up, Debra!\n________\n\n[Drama thread 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/ljpi27/id_like_to_live_debra/gnewclt/)\n\n>I see both points of view. Needles and injections don\u2019t bother me even if it\u2019s in an unexpected location like a classroom. I used to work with a fellow that had to give himself insulin injections in the bathroom during office hours and I barely even noticed. On the other hand, if Debra or others are disturbed by it then couldn\u2019t that girl go to the bathroom for the shot? I\u2019m pretty sure she will live the additional sixty seconds it takes to walk down the hall.\n\n>> This person is trying to keep from letting their sugar levels from harming their vital organs, eyes, fingers and toes. If that makes you uncomfortable get fucked\n\n>>> Doesn\u2019t make me uncomfortable at all. I used to have to give insulin injections and do blood tests. My point was that there are people that can become ill from seeing bodily fluids. If such a person is present and it\u2019s not an emergency, it just doesn\u2019t seem that taxing to walk to a private area to administer the test or injection. God you\u2019re a whiney little cunt... calm down\n\n>>>> Or how about you just fucking look away? Why does the fault fall on the person trying to protect themselves from dying and not the person investigating what they are doing? Mind your own damn business\n\n>>>>> It doesn\u2019t bother me you illiterate shit sack. As I\u2019ve said to the other 30 people I\u2019ve triggered, if I were a diabetic and it wasn\u2019t an emergency, just a regular shot 20 minutes before my meal, I would do my best to handle these things in private for the benefit of other people that might be put off by it. I wouldn\u2019t sit there and think \u201cI\u2019m sick so if somebody is made uncomfortable by this then they should go fuck themselves\u201d\n\n>> Yeah, a bathroom isn't really a hygienic place to give a shot.\n\n>>> It\u2019s an intramuscular shot that can be administered standing up over the bathroom counter. Not a huge risk of infection. Also classrooms are covered in bacteria so let\u2019s not act as though it\u2019s a far more hygienic location.\n>>> Edit: I am aware it\u2019s subcutaneous injection, I simply wrote the wrong term. I apologize to everyone.\n>>>> Type 1 26 years. I am not about to take my shot in a bathroom, thanks for playing.  \n>>>> I use a pen. I can put on a fresh needle, inject into my arm and be done in less than 30 seconds. I do not want to put my pen down on a bathroom surface at any point.  \n>>>> Pansy ass snowflakes can just cope.\n>>>>> You may not and that\u2019s your prerogative but many people do use the bathroom to administer their injections. The bathroom at our office (same place I worked at with my diabetic friend) had a discarded sharps container across from the sink.\n>>>>>> Yes, we are forced to because precious snowflakes feel icky poo when they see needles.\n>>>>>> It's fucking ridiculous that any person over the age of three needs me to hide behind closed doors to test my blood sugar or take a shot. \n>>>>>>> Well go start an organization or keep fucking whining on Reddit. Jesus Christ. \n\n_____ \n[Some parts really spiraled out of control](https://i.imgur.com/67fCSgQ.png)\n____ \n\nAnd as a bonus we had [some grammar nazis show up](https://www.reddit.com/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/ljpi27/id_like_to_live_debra/gnewgx9/):\n\n> Injecting the work \"like\" in every sentence is a hallmark of someone who should never be taken seriously.\n\n>> People that focus more on the way people speak rather than what they say don't deserve to be taken seriously.\n\n>>> I agree, you should focus on what they are saying rather then how they say it.  \n>>> That being said, I still personally find it incredibly annoying when someone overuses ''like\" in a sentence.\n\n>> I don\u2019t know why you\u2019ve been downvoted.

I've walked across my place of work to the employee room, grabbed my kit, walked across the establishment, waited in line for a stall in the customer bathroom, injected, and walked back to the employee room. \n\nI can't count the cumulative number of minutes I've spent inconveniencing myself to administer my insulin, but I can guarantee you it's longer than it takes to simply turn one's head in the other direction and just... not look.\n\nHere's the thing about disabilities, the non-disabled HATE to see them. Diabetes is very much an invisible disability, and that's all well and good until someone (discreetly) whips a needle out. You wouldn't stare at someone's missing limb or tell them to go away because it \"disturbs\" you, so why would you do the same to someone who is simply trying to live as close to a normal life as possible and not have to inject insulin before a meal while sitting on a toilet seat.\n\n(I do want to say that considering diabetes a disability is kind of a grey area.

If I am in a situation that requires me to take insulin I'm not going to wait. It is bad enough I have to pay ridiculous amounts of money for a hormone that normal people get for free. The last thing I want to put up with is some stranger pestering me about trying to stay alive. Just mind your own business. If you really dont like the sight of needles or blood then don't look.",

I'll try to keep my story short.\n\nA friend of my brother's started having a seizure in our yard so we were trying to make sure she was okay and, you know, didn't hit her head on a rock or anything. Neighbor sees through her window, and starts freaking the fuck out because \"what if my child looks out the window and sees somebody DYING???\"\n\nMy brother repeatedly told her that it's not fatal, it just happens sometimes, takes a minute or two to subside and she'll be normal again, block your window and mind your own business. Yet she came out of her own damn house to continue screaming at us anyway. My dad heard the shouting and actually came out to call her out for her shitty behavior and said something like \"So you thought she was dying and you complained about your kid seeing it, instead of doing something useful like calling 911?\n\nSeriously... it's more effort to screech at your neighbors (and even go outside to continue yelling!) than to distract your damn kid away from possibly looking out the window...",

            "So maybe I\u2019m in a unique position to discuss this since I\u2019ve experience panic attacks and I\u2019m a type one diabetic(since I was 14 months old). Thankfully I am not needle squeamish at all(as someone who\u2019s been jabbing herself her whole life how could I be?), but other things trigger my anxiety.\n\nUltimately? It\u2019s up to the person who has anxiety to either avoid triggers or develop coping mechanisms to  deal with their anxiety. What I\u2019m trying to say is; you getting triggered by me injecting my medication through a needle is not my fault nor my responsibility. I, for instance, get very anxious when faced with people raising their voices(for any reason). It\u2019s panic attack inducing. I would not tell people to speak in a constant level tone or whisper when I\u2019m having a bad day. I would remove myself from the situation or practice my coping mechanisms. It\u2019s up to me to control the symptoms of my anxiety, not the responsibility of other people to avoid triggering them.\n\nNow it\u2019s perfectly reasonable for someone who is squeamish of needles to express this to a diabetic. I wouldn\u2019t be offended, I get it. But that person would need to understand that when a diabetic needs their insulin, they are not obligated to bend to your will to make you comfortable. You, however, can turn your head away. \n\nPeople are allowed to be comfortable, but your comfort and anxiety doesn\u2019t top MY health and well-being.",

I said that she could say sorry, and she said that she can't be sorry for something that she said when she wasn't in the right mindset. \n\nI have other examples, but it's basically what you see in this post, \"The world needs to adjust to my problems no matter how it affects them...but I'm not going to do anything to help with that problem because I'm already suffering more than you can ever imagine\"",

            "VR discourse really bothers me. I\u2019ve been in VR research for the last year and a half (PhD program, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m finishing it though). In that time I\u2019ve read a number of articles about how much more immersive VR is over flat, studies techniques to make it *even more* immersive than it is, and read many studies that suggest that this immersive quality is useful (to change peoples behaviors/reactions, combat phobias, as pain treatment, for mindfulness, etc). For the most part, early be adopters and other lay consumers have been cheering on these findings. But the second the conversation becomes about sexual harassment in social vr spaces, or negative aspects of more immersive violence simulators is brought up you get entirely shut down and people act like you\u2019re being silly. \n\nYou can\u2019t simultaneously champion the positive effects of VR and heightened immersion while also acting like there couldn\u2019t possibly negative effects that work through the same mechanisms. If VR can make people less racially biased or more pro-social or whatever; why is it crazy to imagine that it could make people more violent or sexually aggressive? These concerns are entirely reasonable, and it\u2019s still early to say for sure either way on the matter. We are learning new things about the psychological effects of vr (and video games in general, for that matter) literally all the time. \n\nAlso, groping someone in a video game is not really analogous to teabagging, imo. It\u2019s more like when people were doing virtual lynching in Red Dead Online. It\u2019s specifically targeted and makes the platform more hostile to a specific group of people.\n\nedit: I guess I shouldn't be terribly shocked, but I have also been reported to Reddit's suicide hotline.",

So every time we teabagged someone in halo, that \"victim\" needs an article written about them about how there are no safety protections in place for virtual groping?\n\nFor context, (1) - the meta verse incident is different from what this jackass is referring to, and (2) 'she feels like his hand was groping her' - the context is fairly important:\n\n> When Aaron Stanton heard about the incident at Meta, he was transported to October 2016. That was when a gamer, Jordan Belamire, penned an open letter on Medium describing being groped in Quivr, a game Stanton co-designed in which players, equipped with bow and arrows, shoot zombies.\n> \n> In the letter, Belamire described entering a multiplayer mode, where all characters were exactly the same save for their voices. \u201cIn between a wave of zombies and demons to shoot down, I was hanging out next to BigBro442, waiting for our next attack. Suddenly, BigBro442\u2019s disembodied helmet faced me dead-on. **His floating hand approached my body, and he started to virtually rub my chest. \u2018Stop!\u2019 I cried \u2026 This goaded him on, and even when I turned away from him, he chased me around, making grabbing and pinching motions near my chest. Emboldened, he even shoved his hand toward my virtual crotch and began rubbing.**\n> \n> **\u201cThere I was, being virtually groped in a snowy fortress with my brother-in-law and husband watching.\u201d**\n\nThat's pretty fucking blatant and it is wild to downplay this story that much in the comment. \n\nAt this point I don't know what scenarios are worse:\n\n1) That the commentator didn't seem to understand what happened at all and didn't read it\n\n2) That the commentator did understand but lied anyways. Like blatantly lied. The article isn't about the Metaverse incident it is bringing up context of sexual harassment in VR not to mention that shit ass analogy trying to downplay it and forcibly link this to teabagging in Halo. \n\n3) That the rest of the subreddit piled on upvotes and awards either because they didn't read the article OR they didn't care cause fuck women right?\n\n4) Or this was a brigade. \n\n(3) scares me the most. It was a two line comment and it was trivial to debunk it if you spent less than 30 seconds skimming the whole thing yet virtually none of the responses mention this. At all. \n\nTo anyone else without context, VR is fairly intimate (that is what the tech is designed for - to immerse you fully into the virtual environment). If someone is right in front of you it **feels** like someone is right in front of you. Try some VR goggles at the various stores - they usually have an Oculus or HTC Vive lying around to demo and you'll see what I mean.",

That said, it's difficult to have a conversation about lockdowns when the most vocal groups criticizing them are the \"muh rights\" and \"COVID is a lie\" crowds. For example, one of the main rallying people in my city for the voice of small business owners is less about supporting small businesses and WAY more about \"COVID is a conspiracy.\"\n\nTo further the issue, the same people who claim to not want lockdowns are the exact same people who aren't doing what they should to prevent them. Just because you aren't in lockdown doesn't mean you should act like life is 100% back to normal. Are lockdowns the *perfect* solution? No. Are they a good solution? Possibly, we don't know yet for sure. If you look at the UK, there was a *sharp* drop in infections shortly after lockdown, going down to roughly half now. It's a question of whether or not that was the best way to drop infections.",

            "This is truly a \"both sides\" argument, where the truth is somewhere in the middle (not all arguments are like this, but this one definitely is, don't #enlightenedcentrism me.\n\nClearly as many posters here point out, there are many examples of where a government will impose restrictions on an individual. And pure libertarianism is just incompatible with the way modern societies operate.\n\nBut I keep seeing this shitty seatbelt example rolled out as though it's some sort of slam dunk, but it's just a shitty: incomplete argument: Firstly proving that there are examples where we as a society have determined over a long time that we are willing to let the governent infringe on in individual liberties is easy, but doesn't help us on the most important point: **what is the threshold?**\n\nIf it is demonstrable that masks save lives during covid, it must also be true that wearing masks forever would reduce lives lost to influenza. Influenza kills about 60k people in the US each year, much less than the 250k killed by covid so far this year, but still a large number. So on the assumption that you don't believe masks should be worn when the covid pandemic ends, where is your threshold? And what should a government's threshold be? Is it 65k? Is it 100k? Is it 200k? It's not as though we're orders of magnitude apart here. Perhaps your threshold is \"when hospitals are in immediate danger of being overrun\". Perhaps it is \"if there is a remote change of hospitals being overrun in the medium term future\". Perhaps your threshold is specific to your area or hospital capacity.\n\nThe reality is that most people haven't adequately considered their personal threshold on such topics, or even that there is a threshold that exists. Rather masks/covid restrictions and similar interventions have been adopted into the culture war and get the same amount of nuance that other culture war topics get.\n\nThe seatbelt example is specifically shitty because seatbelts are entirely to save oneself. Whilst covid restrictions are restrictions on personal liberty for the benefit of others. Particularly in the case of the young and healthy, who's liberties are being restricted despite negligible risk to their own health. Perhaps this is justified, I personally think it is in some circumstances, but can also see very good arguments against it, and appreciate that ultimately we can only differ on thresholds."

It seems like former Escapist guys like Yahtzee and Jim plus the Channel Awesome dudes like ~~Angry Joe~~, and maybe a couple others like ~~Pat~~ and James Rolfe are the only ones not getting embroiled in stupid shit. Yet.\n\nHonestly, I think part of the problem with these guys is they have no agents, no PR guys or anything to to tell the how to react when situations like the WSJ article on Pewdiepie happen to them-- they just go ballistic, and since they're a community they go *concertedly* ballistic.\n\nedit: Nvermind, Pat's done a couple of dumb things too.\nEdit2: And Joe tried amplifying this latest fiasco, so cross him off too.

They cheer and cackle like demons at the gate of hell while big and multi billionaire corporations fill their pockets, exploiting the pain of families victims of gamers.\n\nWhile this happens, more and more blood flows between our streets.

As we're a monarchy a governor general who represents the English queen decided to impeach old Gough, with pressure from the American government in order to install a conservative.

The right to privacy is fundamental to all other rights we may have. It shocks me to see people supposedly progressive who are so fine with the government observing your genealogy. \n\nWhat if a stores Terms and Conditions that applied to every purchase was that your credit card number goes to the government. What if a retailers terms of service was selling your likeness to companies and the government. What if renting an apartment meant that the landlord could install hidden cameras anywhere. Would you say, \u201coh just don\u2019t masturbate, or use the restroom in your building,\u201d? As far as I\u2019m concerned these are breaches of privacy, even with informed consent, and shouldn\u2019t be allowed. \n\nSome of you will read this as defending rapists which is yknow, dumb.

People can settle and start a family in that time, and now its more severely impacting others lives that may do more harm than good. For something as serious as rape, the consensus is usually that the harm caused by that action justifies the harm caused 14 years later, but for a minor theft for example, it wouldnt.\n\nThese are topics that should be able to be discussed, and are important to discuss, outside the emotion triggered by specific cases.",

It all started when an ATG mod [reminded boys](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTeenGirls/comments/cqe5fz/boys_please_refrain_from_answering_questions/) to not \"answer questions directed at girls\". She said that for certain posts, almost 70% of answers are given by boys. A lot of commenters seemed to agree, so far.\n\nThe problem didn't stop though, and another mod [provided evidence](https://imgur.com/a/sqIkU5I)  (in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTeenGirls/comments/ct8z4r/the_rumors_about_the_boys_thing/exjd1xs/)) that too many boys are taking over.\n\n> The male majority is the issue. The male majority commenting and spamming the comment section is the issue.\n\n>  Yes I know that. It's in the name \"Ask Teen Girls\". However, when the comments aren't guys answering those questions, it's not an issue since they're not trying to pretend to be a girl and answer the question or answer the question at all. Just because it's a sub to ask teen girls stuff doesn't mean it should be a sub where ONLY teen girls can comment.\n\nEven some users aren't happy with it: \"[Why are so many questions here answered by males?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTeenGirls/comments/ct46w3/why_are_so_many_questions_here_answered_by_males/exihgql/)\". Initially some users [suggested](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTeenGirls/comments/ct9t3v/does_anyone_think_that_this_system_will_work_for/) some solutions for it, but the mods ultimately decided to ban top-level male commenters as a whole for certain posts, pinning comments reminding boys to not comment.\n\n> Because males feel like they need to butt in in a female area. [...] We're working on the issue and will come up with a solution here very soon.\n\n[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTeenGirls/comments/cufrq9/why_do_girls_get_mad_when_their_boyfriends_say/exv1ufc/)'s an example - people aren't happy with it. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTeenGirls/comments/ctndgb/gamer_girls_what_is_your_favorite_game/exmc04b/?context=3)'s another example.  [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTeenGirls/comments/ctgjcd/how_do_you_expressrelease_your_anger/exlqysi/)'s a third example.\n\n> Fuck off, we can reply too\n\n> That\u2019s a good way to get your ass banned.....\n\nPeople then started asking: [What do you think of this sub banning male commenters?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTeenGirls/comments/ct8s8r/what_do_you_think_of_this_sub_potentially_banning/). \n\n> Said this before and I'll say it again. It's not like guys are trying to disguise their answers as if they're a girl. If you ban guys from commenting altogether, I can guarantee you they'll be a bunch of accounts pretending to be girls which would be much worser than how it is now. Right now most actual answers are from girls but the comments from guys are usually just making jokes or are answers to non gender specific questions.\n\n> Hey mod here, rumor is fake. We're just worried about the female/male ratio\n\nThe drama leaked onto r/AskTeenBoys, where some users questioned why girls aren't banned from commenting but boys are from ATG: \"[Why does the other sub have a comment restriction for the other gender but this one doesn't?\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/askteenboys/comments/cui998/why_does_the_other_sub_have_a_comment_restriction/)\n\n> it is a bit odd but i can understand the reasoning behind it. questions were specifically asking for girls' perspective and boys kept on commenting. (and yes me commenting here is a little ironic too)\n\n> According to a girl who came here from there, it\u2019s because the mods are on a power trip as of late, and would choose to stifle discussion for power\n\n> Also, one of the mods there (who\u2019s the biggest reason this is the case it seems) is essentially a female incel, and if that\u2019s the case it makes sense she wouldn\u2019t want men contributing",

            ">Over the last decade, people have been increasingly critical of right wing social narcissism. They're not offended if someone calls them \"cracker\" so what's wrong with calling someone \"nigger\"? They laugh at gay jokes, why can't those miserable \"SJW\" do the same? And they'd love it if some random woman on a train grabbed their dick so what's wrong with a sneaky little grope now and then if it's not hurting anyone?\nBut these kinds of shitty views are getting increasingly indefensible as the modern world gives the people getting bullied by them a voice. They're no longer confident in their ability to be openly fuckwitted, feigned ignorance isn't good enough anymore.. what's a casual racist to do?\nWell, some of them go the JonTron way. \"But what if... What if I was actually right?\". If science and statistics can prove that black people are stupid and violent because they're black people then nobody can call them an asshole anymore right? It's not racism, it's facts.\nBut there's always Option B, which is the favourite of toddlers everywhere -- start pointing fingers. \"Yeah I may have done something wrong but that kid did something way worse first\". Someone else is the true villain and by some tortured logic they're now absolved.\nJust like the murderers and rapists in prison kicking out the teeth of a paedo, they've created some situation where their \"goodness\" is relative instead of objective because objectivity doesn't do them any favours.\nAnd so here we are. The orange idiot with his ill-fitting suit and someone elses billion dollar bank account has launched a war of attrition against the free press. He's advocated war crimes and torture. He's fired, forgotten or fucked over anyone who might stand in his way. His plans are stupid, racist, sexist, homophobic, immoral and going to happen if the country likes it or not.\nBut have you seen those leftists? They worship some woman who sacrifices babies in pizza shops and they're trying to control what I think and they punched a Nazi and that's not a good thing any more and they're the ones who are really racist along with black people who also do all the crimes and we had a gay guy and they wouldn't let him talk and that's homopjobic and you know they remind me of Hitler but not in a good way like Hitler, like the bad stories about Hitler they made up so they could secretly be Hitler themselves.\nAnyway, that but they also have reddit accounts.\n\nslowclap.gif",

            "Gotta say, I have seen a lot of people defending his views, and criticising people for allowing his \"politics\" (I'll get onto that in a minute) to affect their enjoyment of his show. \n\nSo I am a bit surprised that these views are being defended as not racist, I suppose this might be because I live in the UK and here what he said would just end his career and haunt him forever. However, many people are supporting him. Just weird to me, the UK is pretty fucking far right at the moment but nobody has truly been this outright racist without being lambasted. (Except say the Daily Mail).\n\nNow the second point, people are defeding his actions claiming that this is a political view and is a perfectly fine viewpoint to have as a political alignment. But nothing of which he said is political, it's not about policies or parties, it was discrimminating between people due to their race. Based on facts that were either wrong or he was misinterpreting. \n\nNow finally, I think I have to defend those no longer wishing to watch his show. Not many people are comfortable with supporting (either financially or just through views) a person who is, worst case, a racist or, best case, very far right wing and a bit misguided on what is correct\n\n**Ninja Edit**: I also would like to say I'm trying to remain unbiased, but I'm Irish and I definitely cannot agree with his views on colonialism. It did nothing good for the world, especially not Ireland.",
            "Man, there are some disingenuous motherfuckin charts thrown out there trying to defend racisism.\n\n [This dude's](https://np.reddit.com/r/jontron/comments/5z3dql/_/dew3ote?context=1000) chart is tracking numbers of homicides to try and say that black people are more violent. Number of homicides would be the number of victims, not number of bad guys. So, if one guy kills seven people that is seven homicides. Also, homicide means that a person died due to human causes. If a drunk/negligent driver kills a family of 4 in a traffic accident, in many places that's listed as 4 homicides, even though it's not murder. Plus I want to know where this chart is from. It doesn't cite a source. It also says it is by \"county\" which tells me would be a study of a particular state, and not the country altogether. I'm sure this guy didn't search the state with the worst possible representation of black people to push his narrative, no...\n\n[This guy's chart](https://np.reddit.com/r/jontron/comments/5z3dql/_/devzjoo) is just as bad. First it divides each group by race first, then divides them by wealth. That probably wouldn't be much of a big deal if it wasn't going all the way back to the 80's. This sets back both the black and Hispanic communities, as they had a very large wealth disparity from whites over this time frame. There is still a large wealth disparity, but it just gets worse going back. Plus, that's just way too pointed a group to make any sort of broad statement about race. I mean look at what it says, it is looking at people who \"eventually went to jail\" (I guess at some point in there lives) who were born only between the years 1957 and 1965. It then takes that specific group and divides them up according to race, then divides that group based on how much money they had in freaking 1985 when they were 20-28 years old. That is so specific it's a niche of a niche. All that and it just looks at incarcerations. It doesn't specify why. How many were for weed, or non violent offenses? That's a stupid chart to use to push an agenda of \"violent black people\".",

            "People just don\u2019t know what self defense is for sadly. You have to believe to be in imminent threat of death or bodily harm, this interaction wasn\u2019t that grave threat because 1) gun guy left came back with the gun means he was safe enough to stay in doors and call cops, plus he escalated the situation 2) warning shot means he didn\u2019t fear for his life, when faced with imminent threat you slug the threat not posture 3) after the scuffle gun guy and teal guy were quite aways away and teal no longer pursued there was like 1-2 second where gun guy aims the gun at teal guy and shoots teal guy despite teal being frozen still (probably realizing if he kept fighting for the gun he might die). It may have been legit if the gun was fired during the scuffle not after it, but gun guy would probably still be dinged because of 1 & 2 is probably illegal brandishing of a gun. And if you are doing something illegal that provokes others self defense no longer applies. But it wasn\u2019t during the scuffle. That\u2019s my current take on this situation.",

            "Ah this is always a messy one - a number of entangled dilemmas.\n\nSo we have:\n\n* the 'right to dress revealingly without shaming'\n* potential 'asking to be raped' victim shaming\n* how much freedom parents should give their teenage kids\n\nand the biggest of all..\n\n* teenage/adolescent bodies - physical development being out of sync with psychological development\n\nIssue #1 is murky because while I certainly don't think social shaming is good for adults and much less for kids, I also don't think the opposite extreme of 'all dress styles are beyond reproach' is a great mentality.\n\nIssue #2 is pretty cut and dry for me at least, the personal responsibility will always be on the sex offender, not the person who they found appealing.\n\nIssue #3 I don't feel qualified to speak on in this instance\n\nIssue #4? Yes that's one I can't help but give my thoughts on because fallacies make my head explode and this is one of the biggest cases of collectively missing the mark for noble reasons that don't actually help the matter by obfuscating the actuality.\n\nNobody should be ogling minors because, ogling generally not being good aside, they aren't of a psychological age to give informed consent to sexuality. We as societies seem to have agreed though that because they're kids and not adults, it's only some fringe perverts that would even find a teenage body anything to notice. The line is far blurrier than that, because there's no solid line on a physical level, that's not how the transition from child to adult occurs - there's a whole space in between where everyone will transition at different rates and go from mostly resembling a child to mostly resembling an adult.\n\nDuring this phase, females are going to have features that are 60/70/80% woman and so on a purely biological level, that's likely to catch the eye of a man who finds adult female features attractive. I say \"catch the eye\" because there's no perfect terminology, I'm not talking about 'checking them out' but seeing and noticing. From there it comes down to whether a person reacts appropriately or not, but the experience is going to be unsettling for most men *because* of the resemblance to a woman's body.\n\n**I think this is a large part of where the angry rejection comes from - some is from concerned parents worried about sex pests but I'd venture most is from men who feel guilty and conflicted for turning around, looking at an attractive figure in revealing clothes and then realising it's a minor.**\n\nIt's understandable but it's misdirected, because the problem is not that they're capable of dressing attractively, it's in how somebody might respond behaviourally to that sight. The other frustration for me is that it's projected onto this shady other ('the pedos') when this is a near universal thing, and I say that as a man with almost exclusively straight male friends whom I've known since school - every single one has at one point or another supported my interpretation on this, though most would declare it non-canon and get angry if you were to acknowledge it.\n\nThey don't consider themselves 'a pedo' and thus that reaction cannot occur, but it did occur, so now what? That's the dilemma and that's why this evokes such a response. I'll note that this has never once occurred when it's been an obese teenage girl, only a conventionally attractively bodied girl. The same concern, likewise, is never voiced when it's a male.\n\nUnfortunately there are, of course, those shady 'others' who will raise this legitimate fallacy for the purpose of justifying sex with minors, making it very difficult for anybody to acknowledge this without suspicion of ulterior predatory motives.",

The UK government is bowing to Israeli pressure, they WANT the instability in Lebanon. Of course I am angry at the way they handled the situation, but they want to install a puppet government that will bow to the French and Americans.

Here it is:\n\n>On the other hand, I think it's a bit ridiculous how much people focus on this, given that A LOT of our ancestors moved here without knowing English first. Nobody forced language requirements on Germans and Italians back in the day, and plenty moved here, didn't learn the language very well, but their kids picked it up. Hell, I've heard of Irish people who moved to the U.S. and pointedly refused to speak English because they were finally in a country where  it was *legal* to speak Irish. It's always been this way, so I'm not especially concerned about the Asian and Latino immigrants we mostly get now. I think people need to accept that naturalization is always going to be like a two-generation process, because that seems to be roughly how it's always worked.\n\n>I do think we should provide more resources to help people learn the language, but I'm not overly concerned with forcing them into it. Not knowing the language already hurts them a lot more than it hurts me anyway, it's not like they lack incentive.\n\nThis was in response to a post about a comment by Obama to the effect that it's okay to want immigrants to learn English before they come to the U.S., which the sub was very excited about because if Obama said it, that meant they weren't racist I guess.\n\nThis was the first and only time I ever commented in r/conservative, and it looks like I was banned specifically for \"brigading.\" I didn't even know where I was, I just clicked on something in r/popular and commented.",
