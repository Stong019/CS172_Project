Reproducing some of it here for those who can't access it. \n\n> Dear Mods,\n> \n> We want to let you know that your community has been quarantined, as outlined in Reddit\u2019s Content Policy.\n> \n> The reason for the quarantine is that over the last few months we have observed repeated rule-breaking behavior in your community and an over-reliance on Reddit admins to manage users and remove posts that violate our content policy, including content that encourages or incites violence. Most recently, we have observed this behavior in the form of encouragement of violence towards police officers and public officials in Oregon. This is not only in violation of our site-wide policies, but also your own community rules (rule #9). You can find violating content that we removed in your mod logs.\n>\n>...\n>\n> Next steps:\n> \n> You unambiguously communicate to your subscribers that violent content is unacceptable.\n> \n> You communicate to your users that reporting is a core function of Reddit and is essential to maintaining the health and viability of the community.\n> \n> Following that, we will continue to monitor your community, specifically looking at report rate and for patterns of rule-violating content.\n> \n> Undertake any other actions you determine to reduce the amount of rule-violating content.\n> \n> Following these changes, we will consider an appeal to lift the quarantine, in line with the process outlined here.\n\nA screenshot of the modlog with [admin removals](https://magaimg.net/img/8ax3.png) was also shared.\n\nAbout 4 hours after the quarantine, the previous sticky about it was removed and replaced with [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/c5vgga/rule_1_violence_and_what_it_means_help_us_help_you/) one instructing T_D users about violence\n\nWe've recieved a modmail from a leaker in a private T_D subreddit that was a \"secret 'think tank' of reddit's elite top minds\".

[Negative media attention](https://thenextweb.com/opinion/2019/06/25/you-cant-offer-to-murder-cops-on-reddit-unless-youre-on-r-thedonald/) results in Reddit taking action.\n\n[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/2fpdax/time_to_talk/ckbga2v/) is a comment from u/ImNotJesus almost 5 years ago that summarizes how the admins respond to damaging content. It remains accurate even today.\n\n>Here's why I'm angry.  \n>  \n>You're doing the **exact same** thing you do every time there's bad press. Deal with it at the last possible moment (like [/r/jailbait](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbait/)) once there's bad press forcing you to do so. Then you play it off like some moral revelation and use free speech as the reason why it doesn't set a precedent. It is **identical** to what always happens.  \n>  \n>[Here is the blog post](http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/pmj7f/a_necessary_change_in_policy/) from when you banned [/r/jailbait](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbait/). Note the exact same thing. \"We've decided that it's time for a change\" that happens to coincide with [Anderson Cooper doing a story about it on CNN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversial_Reddit_communities#.2Fr.2Fjailbait).  \n>  \n>To be clear, I understand *why* you're doing it. I understand that a lot of companies do the same which is **totally fine**. Just don't then make a blog post about how wonderful free speech is. If the blog post said \"We actually wanted to keep allowing them but got too many notices from lawyers for that to work so we had to ban them\" that would be *fine* by me. The doublepseak and hypocrisy is what's annoying me. You can't take the moral highground on this when you've let [/r/photoplunder](https://www.reddit.com/r/photoplunder/) stay open for however long it has.  \n>  \n>This is just what happens when your stance is that anything goes. If you allow subreddits devoted to sex with dogs, **of course** people will be outraged when you take down pictures of naked celebrities. It would be impossible for that to not seem capricious. If you allow subreddits like r/n******, **of course** they're going to be assholes who gang up to brigade. The fine users of [/r/jailbait](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbait/) are sharing kiddy porn? What a **shocking** revelation. The point is, you can't let the inmates run the asylum and then get shocked when someone smears shit on the wall. Stand up for standards for a change. Actually make a stance for what you want reddit to be. You'll piss off some people but who cares? They're the shitty people you don't want anyway. Instead you're just alienating the good users who are sick of all of the shit on the walls.",
            "I'm seeing numerous comments on both /r/Conservative and /r/the_donald saying how they should report Reddit to various government agencies, and I can't help but find it completely ironic how these \"small government\" and \"free market\" people *immediately* jump to the government when it comes to wanting the government to stop a private company from enforcing their Terms of Service on a group of individuals who have routinely and blatantly violated those Terms of Service for several years.\n\nIt's almost like they either have no idea what their ideals are, or they simply have no ideals are really just pathetic assholes in every way imaginable.",

            "Quarantined? That's it? Well, I guess it's better than nothing. T_D is fundamentally worse than many subs that have been banned in the past for violent rhetoric, by the way. For anyone wondering, a full ban would be more than justified. Here's the reason why:\n\n - [r/T_D promoted the charlottesville fascist rally that culminated in a nazi terror attack that wounded dozens and killed three.](http://archive.is/3X8PB) This was stickied by the mods at the time. Denying that this was a fascist rally would put someone *well* outside the realm of reality. It was organized by two famous neonazis: [Richard Spencer and Jason Kessler.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unite_the_Right_rally) T_D was literally complicit in what even the Trump administration has deemed [a terrorist attack.](https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2017-08-14/jeff-sessions-calls-charlottesville-attack-domestic-terrorism)\n\n - [T_D thinks that the gay rights movement is trying to take away their freedoms, and that it will eventually lead to normalizing child rape](https://archive.is/QroHe)\n\n - [Accoding to T_D, black people need to just get over slavery.](http://archive.is/OG9Mq)\n\n - [T_D openly mocks a person who self-immolated, linking the actual video of the individual burning to death](https://archive.is/2MfbK)\n\n - [T_D openly attacks a trans kid, and talks about how \"hets are innately repelled\" by trans people, among other wonderful things](https://archive.is/B6RLz) This is, of course, common for the sub. Its history of anti-trans hatred goes back to its beginnings.\n\n - They hand a hand in radicalizing Lane Davis (u/Seattle4Truth) who murdered his own father over politics.\n\n - [\"Diversity is not strength\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/bxf7wp/the_tower_of_babel_is_a_metaphor_a_united_people/) - essentially an argument in favor of ethnostates and ethnic cleansing\n\n - A guy whose post history includes a lot of [weird fixating on Jews](https://archive.is/5mk5a) has [this to say about black people](https://archive.is/4tVlc) in yet another thread attempting to minimize the NZ terror attack with whataboutisms.\n\n - [A woman isn't a congresswoman because she's a Muslim.](http://archive.is/VSmWv) Also, they're really insistent that their brand of religious hatred and raging xenophobia isn't racism because that, you know, makes it so much better. \n\n - [Muslim immigration was apparently to blame for the Christchurch shooting, not the white supremacist gunmen.](http://archive.is/YZlaz) Look at the big brains on these upvoted users. This sat at fourth from the top the day it was posted. [Here's a later snapshot as time went on and more comments got posted](http://archive.is/DQPxp) attempting to justify it.\n\n - [T_D reposts white supremacist propaganda and it gets to nearly +2000.](https://archive.is/lK9XX) Those comments are amazing. It is apparent that this is not just some sub dedicated to president Trump.",

Essentially, today Donald Trump expressed sentiments that could be considered pro-gun reform ([this is another, perhaps more apt interpretation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/811gsu/rthe_donald_is_imploding_following_trumps_progun/dv01jns/)). He suggested standing up to the NRA, he called a senator \"afraid of the NRA\" and he also said, on national TV, verbatim: \"Take the guns first, go through due process second.\" (as they might say - \"wew lad\")\n\nRight-wing pro-gun people are incredibly upset with him. Especially in this thread, where his reddit user supporters are airing out their grievances with his words, and calling him out, and /r/the_donald users are turning on eachother like never before. \n\nThe threads provided are just some of the drama. Explore the whole comment section. \n\nAdditionally, because of the crazy heavy-handed moderation going on there right now, some of these threads may be deleted. If so, let me know and I can update this post so it doesn't link to nothing. \n\nEdit: [Here is the ceddit link to the thread](https://www.ceddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/80z30g/live_president_trump_meets_with_bipartisan/) - currently, 316 comments out of 1308 scanned have been deleted by mods. This is glorious drama. \n\nEdit 2: Here is [the archived thread](http://archive.is/T26lA) from shortly after I made this post. Lots (maybe all?) of these comments have been deleted since, ***there's some real gold in here folks*** so it's worth perusing for some good laughs after getting your fill of the current thread (will also be nice to have later, as - at this rate - the /r/the_donald mods will delete every comment in the thread).  \n\nEdit 3: ok ok sweet *jesus* - It's been emphatically demanded by a dozen people that I put an epilepsy warning before the gif in the link in edit 4. And I just gotta say, if you're epileptic you can't just go clickin on links in reddit threads like some kinda fuckin cowboy. Some of us were taught to wear bike helmets, and some of us were taught to treat the internet like a mine field of deadly gifs lol - you gotta look out for yourselves ok, flashy gifs are everywhere and you gotta keep your head on a swivel, no one can do that for you, you're fucking warriors. \n\nEdit 4: We're on the front page - \"[*GET IN HERE - IT'S HABBENING*](http://www.fairfaxunderground.com/forum/file.php?40,file=259632,filename=image.gif)\"\n\nEdit 5: Someone PM'd me saying I should put a warning about the gif in Edit ~~3~~4 for people with epilepsy.  So, essentially /r/The_Donald's drama is literally giving people seizures. \n\nEdit 6: Someone sent me [this Removeddit link](https://www.removeddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/80z30g/live_president_trump_meets_with_bipartisan/) where you can see deleted comments / refer back to once the mods over there shit-can this whole thread - appears to be working better than the ceddit link. Enjoy.\n\nEdit 7: [removed comments](https://www.removeddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/80z30g/live_president_trump_meets_with_bipartisan/#): 825/2314 (35.7%) praise the lawd\n\nEdit 8: This could be [one of the best highlights](https://i.imgur.com/oSPUUye.png) from their entire thread (yah their mods deleted these too). \n\n**Final Edit**: Well the censorship-maestro r/the_donald sorority-selection-committee soccer-mom mods have [officially announced my post hurt their feelings](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/8163qc/rules_for_thee_not_for_me/) and graced us by *personally* participating in the drama. These being the mods who deleted [944 comments (38% of the comments)](https://www.removeddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/80z30g/live_president_trump_meets_with_bipartisan/#) from their TMZ-tier dramatic thread last evening (***most the comments were from longtime /t_d users***, easily confirmed by clicking on the users who had their comments deleted in the removeddit link in Edit 7), and who banned *who knows* how many long-time /t_d members - 18 t_d regulars confirmed who commented in this thread alone - including [one with over 200k karma in /t_d alone](https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/811gsu/rthe_donald_is_imploding_following_trumps_progun/dv010ze/) - several of whom were banned for *literally* posting *exact* quotes of things Trump *actually* said *in the meeting* their post was about (they're really not sending their best folks, SAD!)\n\nThus - for the many /t_d users saying \"those were just shills and trolls who got banned and/or whose comments got deleted!\" - and all others curious - simply refer to this Final Edit (or the entire damn archived thread lol) for dispositive, entirely conclusive proof they silenced & culled their own longtime members just for saying they support the 2nd Amendment and disagreeing (in many cases, respectfully) with Donald Trump. \n\nGlad everyone could come together to behold this hilariously embarrassing spectacle together. \n\nKindest Regards, and God Bless America.

He's all over the place. Tomorrow he will probably be pro-gun, and then Friday he will be back to pushing gun control. He does this on other issues as well.

        "selftext": "The_Donald has [gone private](/r/the_donald). \n\nHere is the text of their reason for posterity\n\n>At 8:41pm ET on 5/19/2017 Reddit removed three The_Donald mods because we refused to comply by a special set of rules that were solely imposed on this subreddit to marginalize the only major community which doesn't conform to the echo chamber of Reddit and corporate media.\n\n>Our mod team continues to stand strong in support of free speech, equal treatment and application of the rules for all subreddits. We are temporarily private in a show of strength against these unfair and unequal rules.\n\nFor context, /r/The_Donald has clashed with the admins for quite a while, and had several rules imposed on it, like [being banned from linking to r/politics](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/57e8bc/the_reddit_admins_have_asked_rthe_donald_to_stop/). It is also speculated that the algorithm for r/all being redone and the ability to filter r/all were specific acts taken because of and against the_donald. This crackdown from the admins also comes after a new set of [much stricter rules for moderators](https://www.reddit.com/help/healthycommunities/). While resentments between t_d mods and the admins have been simmering for a long time, there are some specific recent events that have led to this which I detailed in a post yesterday, copied here\n\n---\n\nYesterday, [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6bq61e/hey_admins_try_setting_this_post_to_0/) post daring the admins to change the score  appeared on r/all for a few hours despite showing a score of 0. Many users inside and outside of The_Donald assumed the admins had actually manipulated the score. (Although it's worth noting there's no evidence of this and it could be related to the same glitch that caused the entire frontpage to be r/the_donald. Others are speculating that the post had a positive score before reaching r/all and being downvoted by non t_d users, and then it took a while to disappear from the listing). A similar thing happened with a [second post](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6bs8fo/and_they_reset_it_to_0_reddit_is_really_showing/). To my knowledge, the admins have not responded to these accusations.\n\nToday, a t_d mod stickied a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6bx71r/announcement_we_keep_reddit_alive_but_reddit_is/) ( [mirror](http://archive.is/ysbVu) ) condemning the restrictions admins have placed on the subreddit and threatning that t_d users will leave. The moderator promotes reddit clone Voat, which yesterday announced it may shut down due to lack of funds. Another user is promoting [both Voat and his own site](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6bz637/hey_centipedes_ceo_of_gab_here_why_are_you_still/) as an alternative.\n\nA few posts are cropping up on [like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6bxmnh/hi_admins_there_is_a_soft_rule_here_we_cant_link/) in defiance of the rule against linking r/politics. There are a lot more posts like this in the anti-trump subreddits but they're not worth linking because it's just circlejerking.\n\nOther subreddits have so far reacted with derision. An iamverybaddass [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/iamverybadass/comments/6bxmpf/rthe_donald_mods_are_very_badass/) mocking the t_d mod. Rebuttals from trump supporters are buried in the controversial sorting. [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/iamverybadass/comments/6bxmpf/rthe_donald_mods_are_very_badass/dhqimiz/) [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/iamverybadass/comments/6bxmpf/rthe_donald_mods_are_very_badass/dhqhm2n/) [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/iamverybadass/comments/6bxmpf/rthe_donald_mods_are_very_badass/dhqjhdm/)\n\nThe current #1 post on r/all is [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/MarchAgainstTrump/comments/6byo2a/number_of_people_who_dont_mind_the_donald_is/). A stickied comment accuses Voat of brigading. There's no drama in this thread because it's been overwhelmed with trump opposers.\n\nEDIT 9:45 EST: [t_d mods are announcing that the poster of the complaint and the top mod of t_d has been suspended for 3 days](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6c0i4y/ohsnap_has_been_suspended_they_will_not_divide_us/). As of right now, OhSnap's complaint is unstickied and showing as [removed].\n\n---\n\n**UPDATES**\n\n9:55 EST: kaminsky_ has provided me with [this screenshot](http://archive.is/3qj11) of the \"rising\" page, and told me it was taken after the first mod was removed from the_donald\n\n10:00: Here is a [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/OsMgLEi.jpg) posted to Voat of the alleged message from the admins to the mods of t_d. (I say alleged because I can never know if a screenshot is real or not)\n\n10:04: the_donald users are reacting in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskThe_Donald/comments/6c7zuc/megathread_reddit_admins_remove_leading/) thread\n\n10:12: here is a [post](https://web.archive.org/web/20170520012136/https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6c7oss/first_universities_then_the_internet_then_they/) made by a moderator shortly before the subreddit went private\n\n10:46: The message in the_donald has been changed, promising an update at 9 EST tomorrow\n\n>At 8:41pm ET on 5/19/2017, Reddit Admins removed three The_Donald mods without warning. This was punishment for our refusal to comply to a special set of rules that were imposed only on this subreddit and prevented our members from fully enjoying reddit or our mods from defending users against harassment.\n\n>We are temporarily private in a show of strength against these unfair restrictions. Check back at 9 PM EST tomorrow for an announcement. \n\nand here is a comment from wearytunes, who is lurking their discord\n\n>The general plan seems to be:\n\n >Post in pro-trump communities, link to discord, then upvote\n\n  >go to /r/all/rising and upvote userpage posts and pro-trump content.\n\n>The second is obviously because the admins would have to play whackamole with accounts.\n\n>The first is a bit more devious. They're explicitly trying to implicate as many pro-trump subs as possible, hoping that the crackdown from the admins will so wide that it forces all trump supporters onto voat.\n\n12:22: As the_donald users flee to voat, the current userbase is none too pleased and there is a bit of a war (and some damn buttery popcorn) between [voat's subreddit](https://voat.co/v/thedonald) for Donald Trump and the [official replacement](https://voat.co/v/thepedes) made by the t_d mods. It would seem that the t_d users are losing this battle as there are [many posts](http://i.imgur.com/QHfFaV7.png) on the front page of voat right now that are critical of them\n\n1:28: Since t_d went private, users and mods have been organizing on the aforementioned discord and talking about possible plans for a response. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/r17A26A.png) is a screenshot from that discord. I don't know of anything being a solid plan right now, since I assume anyone in that discord is free to make suggestions.\n\n1:42: A mod of the_donald [says it will be open tomorrow](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/6c8c59/the_donald_has_gone_private_in_protest_of_their/dhssprr/?context=1)\n\n1:30 PM: the_donald is public again, before the expected 9 pm announcement. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6cbkhm/announcement_the_future_of_rthe_donald/) is there post about it which is pretty boring. The drama ends not with a bang but a fizzle\n\nIf you would like anything to be added to this post, PM me. I'm going to turn off inbox replies.\n\n---\n\nPlease respect commenting guidelines.

            "/r/the_donald started out has, and always has been, a glorified /r/circlejerk but for people who are actually and unironically delusional. \n\nThey complain about the left needing \"safe spaces\" but ban anyone who conflicts with their opinions. They can't even *really* defend the president their subreddit is named after, because all the posts they make conveniently don't directly talk about him. They're always just saying \"yeah but look how bad *this* person who isn't relevant in the political sphere anymore was!\" Even if they weren't anywhere near as bad/bad at all. \n\nThey blatantly breaks rules. Vote manipulation and witch hunting (ironic given what they accuse the \"MSM\" of doing to Trump) are just two of them. They actively post personal information of journalists, protesters, etc. To engage in targeted harassment. \n\nThey have no way of actually defending Trump. Again, their posts are all about his \"enemies\" and not the man himself. This is why whenever people try to challenge or criticize them, they're banned. They're not looking for political discourse, they're looking for an echo chamber where they can be as bigoted and insane as they like without much/any restraint. \n\n",

            "A few disjointed thoughts I've had about t_d and related information circulating about Trump:\n\n* The more fire Trump is under, the less constrained t_d gets. Which is really saying something, considering the sub's average temperature / level of restraint. I'm not trying to imply causation, but I personally see some degree of correlation.\n* /u/spez did something dumb a while ago. Okay, that's not fair: he did something indefensibly dumb a while ago. Because of this, t_d members really, **really** like to pick on him. Even when there is literally zero evidence that it's him doing these things. Is he involved? Probably. But they literally have zero evidence that he personally made the decision to de-mod those specific people, and that doesn't matter to them. For all we know, he's recused himself from any actions taken related to t_d (which I don't think is the case, but would potentially be a really smart thing for him to do).\n* I'm really not jealous of the position that the reddit admins are in. My perspective is that they've been backed into a corner by a rabid dog. Simply put: if they ban the sub, they give the mods of the sub literally everything they could have ever wanted: a reason to tell their users to wreak havoc across the entire site. A reason to yell, a reason to scream, a reason to warp reality and smear it across every corner of the internet that they can find. At the same time, by banning the sub, they essentially become brietbart. Which is to say, brietbart wouldn't allow a post critical of Trump. If banned, there would be room to say that reddit doesn't allow a community supportive of him. Two sides of the same \"controlling the message\" coin. By not banning them, the dog is still there.\n* So, they're doing what they can about it: they're removing the mods who are breaking the rules that they've laid out. Their accounts have been suspended, **but not banned.** They can come back to the site if they please. They can post to t_d if they want. The current mods can sticky their posts, or not. The subreddit itself is still around and kicking.\n* Really, the admins appear to be giving t_d users and mods almost excessive amounts of slack. Other accounts have been rightfully banned for far less. Frankly, the insinuation from one of the former mods that he'd shoot the admins is something I'd consider reporting to the police (primarily for record keeping). Yet, for some reason... a three day suspension is deemed sufficient.\n\n\nThe t_d sub has really given me a lot to think about when it comes to freedom of speech. We have a sub that literally prohibits free speech while they scream about how their speech is being violated by a third party who literally has no obligation to facilitate their speech at all in the first place. Meanwhile, this third party continues to choose enable that voice that keeps screaming \"YOU'RE SUPPRESSING OUR FREE SPEECH.\" The irony (ignorance?) here is simply astounding. Frankly when I think about it I get really, really confused as to how we even got here in the first place.\n\nTo be clear on this: yes, reddit collects ad revenue from the sub, which could be construed as a reason to keep them around. t_d prohibits anything that isn't supportive of Trump, which is the basis of my \"prohibits free speech\" statement. Lastly, preventing stickies from being on /r/all isn't suppressive of their speech. Is it fair? No. But does it prevent them from saying what they please? No. Are specific topics off-limits? No. Can they keep posting a series of centipede pictures, implying that the CEO of the site should be anally raped by a centipede? Yup.\n\nIt boggles the mind.",

            "[Donald Trump: The Man Who Doesn\u2019t Lose](https://www.reddit.com/r/donaldtrump/comments/jpz0nb/donald_trump_the_man_who_doesnt_lose/)\n\n>All over the internet, MAGA superstars like you are shriveling faster than Bernie Sander\u2019s dick when asked to split a check at an Applebee\u2019s. Cuckservatives are already jerking off over the prospect of Biden resuming bombing the Middle East and deploying your sons to Afghanistan to die while he accepts millions of dollars and dozens of schoolgirls in kickbacks.\n\n>Apparently everyone has forgotten the most important thing about Donald Trump: THIS MAN DOESN\u2019T KNOW HOW TO LOSE. Losing isn\u2019t even in Trump\u2019s vocabulary. In fact, sources close to Trump say that he had all of the White House dictionaries edited to replace the word LOSE with Hillary Clinton. (Side note: the word RAPIST was replaced with Bill Clinton.)\n\n>So you\u2019ve got two choices. You can gobble down communist propaganda from the MSM like you\u2019re Kamala Harris at a sperm bank. You can believe Reddit and Twitter, which China has pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into. You can let Jack Dorsey fuck your wife. You can neatly package your balls and mail them to a feminist liberal with hairy armpits, neon hair, and venereal disease. If that\u2019s the route you want to go down, then start the soy infusion right now, because you never understood the MAGA movement to begin with.\n\n>Or you can remember that Donald Trump is the smartest man in the entire fucking universe, and the most important person to walk this earth since Jesus Christ. You can remember all the million times when it looked like things were over, yet Trump managed to pull out a victory from the jaws of defeat. If Trump were to see you wringing your hands and weeping over a potential Pedo Joe presidency, he\u2019d think so low of you that he wouldn\u2019t even deign you with a Sad! tweet.\n\n>There\u2019s a reason Donald Trump hasn\u2019t conceded the election. That\u2019s because he knows he\u2019s going to win. We\u2019ve seen him in action enough in the past 5 years that we shouldn\u2019t lose our trust.\n\n>I feel like the swamp has belched out a swarm of mosquitoes which are sucking the life out of my fellow patriots. If you want to succumb, then lie face-down in the mud and we\u2019ll come back to revive your desiccated corpse with an infusion of 100% MAGA Energy. Then, you can tell your grandchildren how you floundered when the weight of uncertainty was on your shoulders instead of standing tall and manning the meme cannons.\n\n>Men don\u2019t flinch in the face of evil. Trump never has. Neither should you.\n\nThis is the cringiest load of Donald fellatio I've ever read",

None of his contact information was published in the article, 2) He's an elected official, and the scrutiny placed upon him was because of his position as an elected official, where he does have to represent his constituents, which includes both men and women, which is why him founding TRP is relevant. \n\n**Final Edit:** Okay, I think I'm done updating this thread!

Like yea man, the fact that you have a FUCKING SIGN above your door that says \"By entering this house you consent to audio and visual recording\" makes me think you are 100% good stuff, not a creeper, just a handsome super alpha male. Jesus Christ the lack of self-awareness is baffling.\n\nIt's best exemplified by the part where he says you should text your one night stand asking if she had a good time and made it home safely. You know, not out of any actual concern for her as a human being or out of anything, but as a desire to have a fucking PAPER TRAIL to protect yourself from accusations. That he doesn't get that he's doing a good thing for 100% the wrong reasons demonstrates the lack of self-awareness going on.",

            "r/NoNewNormal and /r/ivermectin have been promoting the use of an anti-parasite drug that is approved for humans because they believe misinformation that is can prevent or treat COVID-19. \n\nThey believe this because there was a study conducted exploring the use of ivermectin to treat COVID-19, which has [since been retracted due to many flaws](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02081-w).  \nBecause this is an anti-parasite drug, it can be prescribed but is not available and not intended for us as an anti-viral drug for COVID.\n\nThe [FDA says that Ivermectin and should not be taken to treat or prevent COVID](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/why-you-should-not-use-ivermectin-treat-or-prevent-covid-19).  Even the [drugs creator Merck is warning](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-merck-antiparasite/merck-warns-against-using-anti-parasite-drug-to-treat-covid-19-idUSKBN2A42L1) against its use for COVID as well.\n\nUsing this drug for unapproved use is **incredibly dangerous** and has great potential for overdose or interaction with other medicines.  From the FDA link above:\n\n>Even the levels of ivermectin for approved uses can interact with other medications, like blood-thinners. You can also overdose on ivermectin, which can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypotension (low blood pressure), allergic reactions (itching and hives), dizziness, ataxia (problems with balance), seizures, coma and even death. \n\nHowever, since these people have been convinced it is their latest COVID-19 cureall and they can not get it through legitimate means, many are [now raiding tractor supply stores to take horse, sheep, and dog worm medicine that has ivermectin as its active ingredient](https://www.thedailybeast.com/demon-sperm-doctors-new-bogus-cure-has-covid-truthers-eating-horse-paste).\n\nThis is even worse because the animal medicine they are using is about 2% Ivermectin with the vast amount of other drugs components undisclosed and used for those animals.  [Here is an example of the classification data on just one of the horse pastes that these people are being encouraged to take that is 95% undisclosed and has a long list of hazards for human use](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E9OHK1FWYAAdH31?format=jpg&name=large_ including infertility and damage to organs.  \n\nThe number of people raiding these farm stores for animal medicine is leading to [several hospitalizations and flooding of state poison control centers](https://www.npr.org/2021/08/23/1030208101/mississippi-livestock-drug-ivermectin-covid-misinformation).\n\nThe fact is that Ivermectin has no proof it can treat or prevent COVID-19.  Taking human-approved Ivermectin is dangerous without doctor's advice and can lead to hospitalization or death.  Taking **Animal Medicine** is hugely risky, not okay for human consumption, and can damage your fucking organs or kill you.\n\nIt is long past the time for the admins to shut down these communities promulgating COVID misinformation.  By doing nothing, the Reddit admins are allowing users to advocate for dangerous drugs that could kill those who take it.\n\nMore details here:\n\n* [r/NoNewNormal advocates for taking an anti-parasite drug Ivermectin, which can cause seizures, coma, or death - Reddit admins needs to shut this sub down before it kills people that follow this advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/ozbfr7/rnonewnormal_advocates_for_taking_unproven_and/)",

That won't fly.\"\n\nI'm not going to go piss in the popcorn, but just so we are all on the same page: No, the responses are not \"shut up and take it.\" They're just ignoring the responses, which are:\n\n> 1. Demographic gains by trump. (Only declined in white males)\n\nDebatable, but it doesn't matter if the volume of those demographics doesn't stay consistent, [which it didn't](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/demographic-shifts-2016-could-be-enough-defeat-trump-it-s-n1240724).\n\nAdditionally, Trump had *fewer votes* last election. Additionally, *more people voted* this election. Meaning that even if trump picked up some demographic support (again, debatable), the already proven and still retained dem lead had more of an impact. Biden was polled to win, Biden did win.\n\n> 2. The enormous down ballot victories by Republicans\n\nEven many Republicans don't like Trump, but otherwise stand behind Republican policies and agendas. This is directly caused by Trump being a cruel, bumbling fool. (I can absolutely support those statements with evidence and you all know it) \n\n> 3. Trump gaining 10 million seats and loosing (for perspective Obama lost 3 million in second term)\n\nI don't even know what this means. I googled \"Trump gains 10 million seats\" and nothing relevant came back. Regardless, whatever he's referring to, it's probably a misleading representation of data, like everything else here. If he means Trump picked up more overall votes, that's probably because more people voted *overall*, in part due to the highly polarized nature of the election and in part due to many more states making voting easier because of Coronavirus.\n\nIf that's what he does mean, then let's be clear: His argument is that Trump getting more votes is evidence that Biden cheated, and Biden getting more votes is evidence that Biden cheated.\n\n> 4. Biden, who couldn't get 15 people to a pancake breakfast that normally seats 30, got 10 million more votes than Obama. 15 million more than Clinton.\n\nCORONAVIRUS. GOD DAMN. Biden's rallies were *intentionally* limited because of CORONAVIRUS.\n\n> 5. Forensic analysis of votes.\n\nThis isn't even a statement. I don't know what this is. These are just words mashed together. But there have been recounts, and Biden is still confirmed as the winner.\n\n> 6. The results from Bellwether cities\n\nHighly polarized election. This shit'll happen. You can't call an election based on just a few cities, that's not how it works. (Plus didn't several of these *accurately* predict Biden's win, too?) e: plus, plenty got it wrong for Clinton in 2016, too. Bellwether cities are just a neat statistic, it's foolhardy to think they actually have any solid predicting power. This seems to be a case of selective information reinforcing a bias.\n\n> 7. Election rule changes just prior to the election\n\n**CORONAVIRUS**. These rule changes allowed MORE votes to be counted. This is not fraudulent. This is not an error. These were legal changes caused by extenuating circumstances.\n\n> 8. Push for mail in balloting (which is know to be dangerous if not done correctly)\n\n**CORONAVIRUS**. Also, more people allowed to vote doesn't mean the election was rigged, even if you think it was. Also, no, studies and reports even from trump's commission have consistently found no cause for concern on this.\n\n> 9. Anecdotal evidence.\n\nI won't even bother.\n\n> 10. The sudden affirmation of the \"the most secure election in history\" after months of telling us trump was going to cheat\"\n\nThe affirmation by Trump's cybersecurity team, you mean? Listen, if you want to claim a part of Trump's administration is lying, I won't stop you. But that's not evidence that the election was rigged.\n\nAnyway, I know I'm preaching to the choir, but there **are** explanations for these things, whether or not Republicans like them, whether or not Republicans accept or acknowledge them.",

There\u2019s no evidence my 8th grade history class cheated on our finals.  Our teacher left the room for 15 min and everyone cheated. The only way to stop cheating is to monitor and make cheating difficult.  No mail in voting.  Require id and proof of citizenship.  Look for irregularities.  If someone who has had 2 failed runs for presidency suddenly receives more votes than any president in history due to mail in votes then you know there has been massive fraud.  Just saying it aloud is all the evidence you need.  The election was stolen.  Only an idiot or a liar is saying anything to the contrary.",

Not a single thread about that on r/all.\n\nMoral of the story: Don't get your news from reddit, people.",

            "I like Bernie a lot, but I think the \"Bernie Bubble\" of reddit, and particularly r/politics added to some of the voter apathy in the polls. With his supporters appearing arguably more enthusiastic and urgent this election season, LESS of them showed up to vote than 2016. The only way to get your voice heard is to vote and talk to people who don't agree with you, not to circle-jerk online and assume Sanders HAS to win because \"look at all these upvotes.\"  \n\n\nThe funny thing is Biden's campaign knew they didn't have to appeal to young voters, they've said they're a historically unreliable voting block.

            "The problem with /r/Politics is that those people don't understand politics.   Most Americans consider themselves to be both liberal and conservative in various ways.   Almost all people are not whole one or the other.    Even when they are mostly one or the other, they think of themselves as mostly being a happy medium.  \n\nAnd it's that core American perception that they are both Conservative and Liberal in near equal amounts that makes the American electorate what it is, a bunch of liberals who often think of themselves in a conservative context.  \n\nAs such, Presidential Candidates from the Democratic party always tend to come from the moderate faction of the party.   In the 1930s  and 40s when FDR was elected several times.....he didn't win as a left wing extremist.  He won as a moderate from the center.   In the modern world here FDR would be classed as part of the extreme left of the Democratic party, but he wasn't coming from there when he was elected.  \n\nIn the 1930s there were at least 200 Democrats in Congress and the Senate who were to the left of FDR.    In today's Congress there are fewer than five people who are to the left of Sanders.   Sanders isn't electable because he doesn't come from the middle of the political electorate.   \n\nIt took 70 years of shifting political winds to move FDR's views to the far left. \nIf you want to make him electable as President, then you need to get at least 100 other Congressmen and Senators who are to his left elected to office.   And that would take DECADES of political work to move/push the American electorate back to the left.   The Sanders people have a big job to do, but they don't want to do the heavy lifting.  They want results now and only now and never in the future.  As such, they are their own worst enemies.",

I've been lurking in your subs over the past few weeks and many of you were convinced that it was basically a done deal. Well about that...\n\nAlso now instead of bashing the \"MSM\" Trump-style you'll understand why they were always aggregating the other candidate's votes against Bernie alone. Not just because the establishment doesn't like him (although that doesn't help) but mainly because that's how people actually vote: Bernie is seen as a rather extreme choice and struggles to unify beyond his hardcore base. He managed to win while the centrist vote was split across many candidates but as the smaller ones drop out he becomes unbeatable because Bernie is not seen as a viable choice by many voters.\n\nTrump was in a somewhat similar position but with a very important twist: the hardcore MAGAers were older on average and don't just make memes online, they actually vote.",
            "Anyone predicting Bernie's doom has been downvoted to hell for months now. However, it really wasn't that hard to predict.

The event scheduler says that crowder got \"Cold feet\". The \"Cold feet\" meme is born.\n- **The Challenge:** Sam Seder issues an open debate challenge to Crowder which births this truly [top-tier meme](https://twitter.com/KnowNothingTV/status/1333235714587234306). \n- **McInnes:** Gavin McInnes (a white supremacist) wants Seder to appear on his show. Seder would normally refuse but McInnes already has Crowder scheduled and McInnes offers the opportunity for a debate. Crowder instantly cancels.\n- **6/14/21:** Crowder has a debate scheduled with Ethan Klein. 30 minutes before the debate is scheduled Sam Seder ends his normally scheduled livestream early. Crowder's *dad* calls Ethan and cancels citing a \"medical emergency\" with Crowder's pregnant wife. Crowder re-schedules the debate for noon on 6/21/21.

Admitting that he has been following What Seder is doing and where he is. Possibly admitting that he used his pregnant wife as a prop to dodge even the chance of running into Seder. Crowder spends a few visibly shook moments on camera and then flees.\n- **Damage control:** Some hours after the debate Crowder must have pulled in some crazy favors because he suddenly announced an interview with Don Jr. at 7AM the next morning.

When he obviously fails, he retracts to comedy, his safe space. Being called a comedian is perhaps Crowder's most powerful dream. So much that he calls himself that...and the silence around him is painful. Nobody else refers to him as a comedian, so he comes across as desperate. A child crying. You can see this broken man's dreams to be a comedian. To be in front of a laughing crowd. It almost hurts to see how he tries to insert a reference or copy someone else's style in his speech. But he's just not talented. He doesn't \"have it\", and he seems to be at some extent aware of this...I almost feel sorry for him. Crowder for me is the worst because he's so fragile and human and scared that it almost feels bad to be critical of him.

            "To anyone reading this who was a user on that subreddit:\n\nYou don't need to be a chad to find affection from the opposite sex. You just need to care about yourself.\n\nImagine if you ran a restaurant and didn't care about the quality of the food. You just said \"eh whatever\" and sold rotting, stale produce with your meals. You should not be surprised if the customers don't come. Nobody owes you their business. From the consumer's perspective, all they want is a nice meal. If you're not offering one, they're not going to buy. They don't have any obligation to share their business around to ensure that all restaurants have customers. They are looking out for themselves, and they will continue to simply eat where they like the food.\n\nYou have to care about what you're selling before you can find a buyer.\n\nNow the good news is, unlike a restaurant, you only need one customer. This is a lot easier to attain than a profitable business.\n\nBut **you have to care about what you're selling.**\n\nIf you don't exercise, if you eat like garbage, if you don't have any interesting hobbies or passions, then why would anyone want to be a customer?\n\nYou don't need to like football. You don't need to have a six pack. You don't need to have been born with Ryan Gosling's face. You...the you that's reading this...already have everything you need to be loved. You just need to love yourself first before anyone else will see you as worth loving.\n\nReplace sugary drinks with water. Walk or cycle when you go somewhere that's walking or cycling distance. Shower and shave every couple days. Buy clothes that fit you.\n\nFind a community of people in your area that shares an interest or hobby with you and go meet them irl. It doesn't matter if it's all dudes, this is about you feeling good about yourself.\n\nIf you do these things you'll start to notice yourself feeling good about yourself. It happens almost magically. Get your blood flowing and exercise your social muscles and the endorphins will follow.\n\nIf you just keep doing these things, eventually you will encounter someone who sees in you what you see in yourself.\n\nBut if all you see in yourself is someone who's getting screwed over and is sad and lonely, why do you expect anyone else to see something different?",

If you allow subreddits like /r/niggers, **of course** they're going to be assholes who gang up to brigade. The fine users of /r/jailbait are sharing kiddy porn? What a **shocking** revelation. The point is, you can't let the inmates run the asylum and then get shocked when someone smears shit on the wall. Stand up for standards for a change. Actually make a stance for what you want reddit to be. You'll piss off some people but who cares? They're the shitty people you don't want anyway. Instead you're just alienating the good users who are sick of all of the shit on the walls.\n\nEdit: To be **very** clear, I'm not defending the 'there are other bad subs so we should be okay' position a lot of them are taking.

The twitch staff member who presented the twitch stream responded to criticism by joking around on twitter inflaming** r/LivestreamFail **even further.** r/LivestreamFail **is now calling twitch hypocritical again on another thread because of how they banned the \"OG bathtub streamer\", Velvet\\_7, permanently a year ago.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve just learned that the new feature isn\u2019t actually new and that twitch was probably just reminding everyone it existed. I was aware that a similar feature existed but thought this was another new feature implemented for sexual content specifically. I\u2019m sorry for not being thorough!",

            "I quite enjoy the dichotomy that this controversy throws up. You've got Twitch going on about how important it is to have women's voices in gaming, which is true, but they're clearly saying it for self-serving reasons. Then you've got the videos pointing out the massive disconnect between this message and the content twitch delivers, which is also true but is being used to feed a misogynistic fuck-pile of hate. So you've got all these different sides saying things they don't care about to win a different argument altogether, and then they gather on the worst places on the internet to debate it. No wonder it's turned into such an amazing clusterfuck.",
            "I can finally put \u2018not interested\u2019 for xQC??? THANK GOD",

            "A streamer named Miko (I think) was videocalling with one of these bathtub streamers and that girl said:\n\n\"First part of the stream you just show a leg or an arm or something and wait. Then you get in the bathtub and see more and more viewers come in. Then, after about 3 minutes, you see viewership drop.\"\n\nPost nut clarity lol.",

            "Wtf is with people saying they are in a hot tub when they're clearly in a kiddy pool? Can't they just say \"chilling while wet\" or something, at least that would be accurate",
            "It is interesting that they say that sexually suggestive and nude content isn't allowed, but allow some of the hot tub streams to happen. The point about \"what happens if a minor does it\" is interesting because, like those weird spaces on Youtube, this could lead to some big problems with pedos flocking to those streams.  \n\nTwitch is definitely fucking up here and just trying to stick to their guns. This doesn't excuse some of the blatant misogyny and slut shaming that is going on, though.",
            "Y\u2019all remember when Twitch was just that cool site where everyone streamed their games and r/livestreamfail was dedicated to actual fails/mess ups on a livestream and everyone was just having fun?\n\nwhat damn happened to make Twitch fall down this hard",
            "Maybe I'm just old and clueless, but it sure seems like most of these problems would be solved by putting the sexualized streamers in an \"Adult Content\" category, away from the \"Just Chatting\" category. Maybe make users verify their age before being able to see the channel, if you want to be really strict about it.",
            "I don't know much about twitch but it seems reasonable to have some kind of \"hot tub section\" away from the main stuff, I think? If that's the content they make its not a big deal but it does seem slightly out of place seeing it among the \"just chatting\".",
            "I was looking into Amouranth, think she must be a genius showperson, like Madonna, carefully managing her image and personna to cleverly manipulate male psychology. I looked for the banana hot tub video to see her in action and was just ridiculously unprepared for anything, just kept looking for props and setting things up.\n\nHer ass was in frame the whole time, though, so maybe she is a genius after a fashion.",
            "Twitch should just add a NSFW function that doesn\u2019t outright punish content creators...\n\nThat way we\u2019re not at each other\u2019s throats since Twitch has shown time and time again whenever they move the goalpost they\u2019ll have hundreds of people not get caught up that should cuz they play favorites with any rule that comes out.\n\nLet people make the content they want so long as it\u2019s not outright toxic as fuck or breaking any laws.",
            "The problem is that advertisers should NEVER be the vetting voice for content, because their priorities are fundamentally incompatible with our priorities...but they almost always **are** the vetting voice for content at the end of the day.  A world where advertisers fund everything that reaches us will necessarily be harmful along many axes.  Just as in this situation, you will have a \"principled stance\" that wants Advertiser Friendly Content but also Eyes At All Costs.  The Venn diagram where those meet is a nonsensical heap for *anyone else* who is not the platform or the advertisers.",
            "Lol they banned someone because their child appeared on stream while they were afk for a short duration and didn't really do anything concerning, but don't ban the girl who went lived and spread her vagina on stream. Priorities am I right lol this is basically becoming a cam girl site.",
            "Also a lot of streamers have Onlyfans and Pornhub links in their accounts, so kids watching Twitch are definitely exposed to pornographic content. There was a guy streaming in public and someone with no knowledge about Twitch, asked about what he was doing. The streamer proceeds to show him what Twitch was, and the first video that pops up in the homepage is a hot tub stream. It just shows how new customers might get deterred, if they believe Twitch is a gaming streaming site but then the first thing that they see are women in bikini. Twitch lacks consistency in all of their rules and I think that\u2019s where most of the controversy revolves around.",
            "Jesus christ I can't believe chicks can make money off that shit. There are really men out there paying these women to sit in a hot tub lol",
            "What about rename the \"Just Chatting\" category to \"Just Fapping\"?",
            "Tbf the \"not interested\" feature on youtube works as much as a stiff in the morgue. Ive had to mark \"not interested\" in every goddamn late night show thats on the air because i dare to watch last week tonight with that english fuck ONCE. No i dont want to watch  seth weekend update talk about trump. Or colbert, or the jimmys or whatever other clip of theirs youtube gets paid to push. Pass.",

Being able to filter out that content seems cool, though I just don\u2019t watch \u201cjust chatting\u201d streams in the first place, so the whole issue has been non-existent for me anyway.   \nThe entire thing feels like a \u201cdon\u2019t like it, don\u2019t watch it\u201d scenario.",
            "The only thing twitch needs to do is then just updating its ToS to 18. What am i missing?",
            "LSF out here acting like boobs will crumble western civilization on the daily and I'm just worried about the health hazards of staying in a hot tub or pool for hours every day\n\nRemember folks, making young men coom on the internet should be a safe activity first and foremost",
            "I think what people are missing about Twitch's rule and sexually suggestive content is that they think sexually suggestive = anything sexy.\n\nInstead, twitch defines sexually suggestive as simulating sex acts, like pantomiming a blowjob.",
            "The only problem I have with twitch is their double standards. A male streamer had to take his shirt off because he spilt a hot drink on himself, he got banned for a few months. \n\nA female stripper wearing a bikini in a hot tub suffers no consequences.",
            "So confused and out of the loop. Are people really freaking out that they might see someone in a bikini once in a while?\n\nEdit: I guess people are salty because they got banned for less racy stuff?",
            "Honestly I dont get why people are mad about hottub streams. I mean, if they dont like it, they can just not watch it. And if the girls doing them want to show themselfs to get money, I dont mind it either. I dont get why ppl watch it too and I never watched it but the point is I dont bother someone earning money of it. And dont come with the argument that there are underaged kids there, if you are old enough to watch twitch actively, you probably already were on a porn site too. So if you dont want 12 year olds to watch this, you might also bann all porn sites etc and make a second internet for kids.",
            "Just putting this out here.\n\nThe \"Not Interested\" 'Feature' is not new.\n\nIt has been on the website for quite a long time, but it doesn't do anything. The frontpage will still show a variety.\n\nThe recommends are only dependent on what you watch so you wouldn't br shown something you didn't watch previously anyways.",
            "lol why do they have to be the moral horny police at Twitch?  I had no idea Twitch users treat the platform like a bastion of 21st century purity and virginity, especially confusing to me after seeing 10 seconds of any twitch chat stream.",

It's not exactly \"Cyberbullying? just turn off your PC\" here.\n\nI guess a system where you get to filter certain tags would help but oh wait Twitch stopped giving people the option to pick their own tags and now everyone needs to beg if they want a new one to use, huh.",
            ">I tested with a virtual machine, in an incognito browser, whilst connected to a VPN\n\nYou can almost guarantee they didn't, but claiming they did fits the narrative.",
            "The ultimate irony of all of this is that the only reason why there are so many tiddy streamers is because these idiots kept watching them in the first place.",
            "Thumbnail is Mia Malkova by the way",
            "...why does anyone care about this?\n\nThey seem so upset that someone's using their tits to get money from horny saps.\n\nAs if their life is impacted by this sad turn of events.\n\nOhhhh, are they the ones giving away their money? This makes a lot more sense, now. They want Twitch to save their smutty souls.",
            "I say let them stream sexually suggestive content.\n\nIt\u2019s inevitable that there will always be lewd when there is a streaming platform.\n\nAnd an endless supply of thirsty dudes giving them money like Onlyfans."

He should have been the head mod in the first place but previous Subreddit Drama in early 2020 left a close personal friend of the original founder, who was removed by the admins for attempting to monetize the subreddit by selling investment classes run by noted losers of money, as the head mod.  The actual head mod is generally inactive and has only recently returned to, apparently, personally profit off the recent growth and notoriety of the subreddit.  WSB in scrambles.   Additional notes/context from u/fufm  Only other points I would add..  \u2022\t\u2060He is really the only true voice that communicates consistently with the people \u2022\t\u2060He has demonstrated again and again that his motivation is to make the sub a better place, with no regard for personal gain \u2022\t\u2060His ideas are actually good. Like for instance, his angle on the Twitter thing was to make it an auto-algo generated thing based on overall trends in the sub. Infinitely better idea than the cringe factory bullshit they were posting there initially. \u2022\t\u2060He actually gets the sub\n\nRemoved Mods from wsb from u/DeathHopper:\n\n&amp;amp;amp;gt;Here's a screen shot of the recent mod changes: [CLICK](https://i.redd.it/2fp8kndqfef61.jpg)\n\nMegathread about the removing from mods in correlation with market pumps from u/brave_potato:\n\n[click](https://www.reddit.com/r/gme_meltdown/comments/lc76mt/the_mods_of_wsb_a_coordinated_amc_pump/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\nFrom u/frostfall_:\n\n&amp;amp;amp;gt;Zjz statement that was removed by new wsb mods:\n\n[CLICK](https://i.imgur.com/38SdlE3.png)\n\nNew Users made mods with full permission from u/MaiClay:\n\n[click](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/lcaede/rwallstreetbets_is_being_taken_over_from_inactive/glz4v1t/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;amp;amp;amp;context=3)\n\nu/Tentings explaining whats going on for the uninitiated:\n\n&amp;amp;amp;gt;To try to explain it rather briefly in case you don't feel like reading other sources, the original founder/mod of the sub was forcefully removed by admins last year after he attempted to monetize the sub by creating a real \"e-sport like\" trading competition, and he began shilling a trading group business that was rather shady (which he was found to have ties with).\\&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\\&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;Fast forward to now, one of the top mods who has shouldered most of the responsibility for the sub, maintaining bots, interacting with the community, doing most of the mod duties, etc was stripped of his mod powers by the highest ranking mod of the sub. This higher ranking mod is a personal friend of the original founder, has been extremely inactive for the past year or so, and has only returned once the sub gained mainstream popularity. The mod that was ousted made a post that was hastily deleted stating that the highest rating mod and company have been making deals with outside entities in what is another attempt to monetize the sub in the way of movie deals, something to do with the Winklevoss twins, funneling all outside inquiries to private email addresses, etc.  \n&amp;amp;amp;gt;  \n&amp;amp;amp;gt;All in all, just Reddit drama. But the sub seems to have issues with top mods periodically attempting to monetize on recent attention.  \n&amp;amp;amp;gt;  \n&amp;amp;amp;gt;Edit: To add to this, all this occurred late last night when the majority of users were asleep. As of right now the sub is beginning to pick up in terms of activity due to people waking up. The current mod team (that ousted the mod that was held in high regard) brought on a bunch of new mods who have accounts that are less than a week old. These mods are now doing a rather effective job at deleting and banning anyone that brings up this abrupt change in leadership, and any mention of the mod that was kicked. With that said, most users over there are unaware of this change of leadership and unaware that the \u201ccaptain of the ship\u201d is \u201cselling out\u201d the subreddit. And of course, half the sub just doesn\u2019t care and wants to talk about GameStop.\n\n[u/disabledsexrobot (lol) did step down as mod to support u/zjz](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbetstest/comments/lchqc6/due_to_recent_events_i_have_chosen_to_no_longer/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\n&amp;amp;amp;gt;Today has been a really bad day.

It was fun while it lasted. u/zjz as a prevoius subscriber and moderator alongside you in wallstreetbets, thank you for all the incredible hard work you put into the bots that made it possible to moderate a sub of that size.

But one can **not** say that all sociopaths have the same mindset. I personally know quite a few conservatives that are reasonable and willing to reason with a radical liberal. And they reason with such patience and kindness. But I want to clearly point out that being a sociopath is a person with a medical mental illness. It is **not** an description to call just anyone that seems to have insane ideas. If you are offended at all by what I say, please understand that anger is a secondary emotion.

Revert it.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/<subname>/wiki/revisions/config/stylesheet\n\nJust look for the last revision before the fuckery, and click \"revert here\".\n\n* Go to the edit stylesheet page. Remove their uploaded trump fuckery. They uploaded 3 images: biden, trump, and C.  Delete them.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/<subname>/about/stylesheet/\n \nLuckily they didn't remove images on the RPDR sub so it was easy to revert to the old style.\n\n\n* Go to the sidebar history. Revert it if they made changes.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/<subname>/wiki/revisions/config/sidebar\n\n\n* Go to the description history. Revert it if they made changes.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/<subname>/wiki/revisions/config/description\n\n* Go to the automoderator history. Revert it if they made changes.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/<subname>/wiki/revisions/config/automoderator\n\n* go to the submit_text history. Revert it if they  made changes.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/<subname>/wiki/revisions/config/submit_text\n\n* they also fucked with new reddit. So go to https://new.reddit.com/r/<yoursub>/?styling=true. I don't see a way to revert changes there, so I just hit \"reset to defaults\" \n\nAt this point, you should be more or less back to normal. Admins can fix any ordering with the modlist fuckery, so just get people added and figure the rest out later.\n\nI'd also recommend knocking everyone's mod perms down to access, flair, mail, posts for the time being. These are coming in waves, so there are probably more compromised accounts out there. The perms can always be redone later.",

Reddit should have had a policy in place that addressed conflicts of interest like this. If they hire a minor celebrity (like a streamer or youtuber) that person should instantly have NO professionally based interactions with relevant subs, etc. This individual should never have been allowed anywhere near UK Politics (also in light of her shitty father and questionable husband, said only because they claim 'hacking', although his fanfics are still *there* and can't be ignored, she never should have been allowed near children based subreddits, if for no other reason than just to ensure that as many people's hands stay clean).\n\nAnyway, all this to say; the individual that claims doxxing and targeting is problematic, but Reddit's dealing with it all, whether through not ensuring clear parameters, or whatever, has made this whole situation **so** much worse.",

Not long after, they looked for new mods, I applied and got accepted. During a few months, we went back and forth with mods and rules. Two or three times, the head mods removed their account and left it to the next in line.\nAbout three of four months ago it was my turn to take over the throne. The head mod removed himself and everyone else except for me. I reinstated the two other mods we had since they did a good job and I didn't feel like adding new ones.\n\nLife and the sub went on. I kept strictly to the rules I had put up, which also gave me a lot of shit from people who got banned. People thought they had the right to post pictures just because they didn't like the person in particular, but because he or she had a face that made you angry (such as Bryan Silva or a smug bunny we had as sidebar pic for a long time).\n\nWhen I woke up about ten hours ago, everything had turnt to shit. My inbox was packed as well as the mod mail. Looking it up, I couldn't believe what was happening.\nThe people from FPH had literally gone berserk. After putting the sub on lockdown and messaging a reddit admin, I removed at least 150 posts with pictures of Ellen Pao. At the same time I continuously received numerous of mails, both encouraging, nice words, help offering as well as threats and other hateful things.\nI've received well over 200 PM's together with at least 500 comments spanning three threads.\nAs written above, I have talked with a reddit admin who wished me luck in getting this sorted out. I messaged him (or her, I don't really know) and asked if I should remove the whole sub.\nFor those interested, my latest post can be seen here.\n\nEven though a lot of people have supported me and given me credit for taking it easy and not attacking the people (seriously, somebody gilded my linked post), it's the constant harassment that has gotten to me. I've had constant anxiety since I got home and I've thought about removing both the sub and my account.\nI don't post this to get pity thoughts from you. I post this because I just wanted to say that I don't stand behind any of the things people have posted on my sub for the last twelve hours. I don't care about what Mrs Pao \"has done\" and I don't care that FPH has been removed. In one way I am actually glad that FPH was removed.\n\nI don't know what more to write. Thank you for reading and have a nice day.\n\n--------------------------------\n\nI got a message saying that since I locked down the sub, people can't see my post. Didn't think about that.\n[Here](http://i.imgur.com/5H2YXFq.png) is a mirror.\n\n-------------------------\n\nThat is one of the reasons why I like reddit. I can have intelligent discussions, I can make friends, I can look at beautiful people, I can joke around with people etc. But with those \"privileges\" comes all kinds of jerks.\n\n---------------------------------\n\n**I have sent a request to /u/powerlanguage to remove the sub. I feel there is no need to continue with it. I have done my best but thinking it all through, I do not want to be seen as a person who spreads hate and misery even in small dosages.**",

            "You know what, I can sum up this entire story in a little anecdote.\n\nSomewhere out there, there exists a restaurant full of peoples of all kinds.  Academics eat there.  Stoners eat there.  Music lovers eat there.  Gamers eat there.  Everyone eats there, because the food is catered to their taste.  Usually, management doesn't care about what is being said or done by people, as long as the law doesn't come in and shut the place down because someone wanted their hot dog with 11 year old buns.  People all over this restaurant come from all different breeds.  As such, each table may range from relatively quiet, to snarky, to loud, to obnoxious, and so on.  True, some tables may be saying offensive stuff, but there's an unspoken rule to simply not go to those tables if they offend you.  However, some tables do get a little too loud and a little too offensive at times, leading to them being warned and kicked out.  Well there was this one table in particular that did get a little too loud, a little too obnoxious, and a little too offensive for some people's tastes.  The management who own the restaurant decide \"You know, these people are just making others look down on this place.  Less new customers, less people wanting to associate with us.  Fewer return customers.  Hey Pao, go kick them out?\"  So Pao does.\n\nHowever, these people aren't like your every day people.  They show no sign of decency.  They do not leave the restaurant, but instead start smearing shit on the walls, stealing other people's tables, pointing out other tables, and eating other people's food.  When these people are asked to leave again, they are FURIOUS.  They shit smear harder, steal more tables, bring in their own tables, and start throwing racial slurs around and brandishing swastikas and signs declaring the end times.  These people start branding censorship as their banner, crying out against an apparent tyranny in the restaurant.  The owners sit in the back, yelling through a megaphone asking them to leave.  Alas, they do not, and instead walk out and back in.  To anyone passing by, the restaurant is now a shit covered den of hate and toxicity.  In the real world, the cops would be called.  On the internet, there is no one to turn to.\n\nNow I have a question:  People who keep participating in this, why?  Why must you ruin the site for everyone?  Why must you throw a tantrum just because things didn't go your way.  The door is open, the path is clear towards it, yet you insist on trying to destroy the site.  This isn't how one should act.  This is barbarism committed by people who will not face any results from their immaturity.  And no matter the reasons you suggest, and no matter the \"revolution\" you claim, in the end your fight is nothing more than a fit of rage committed out of ill will.  You all are being the worst kind of people.  Yet you act justified.  Good.  Job. ",

As a former mgtow reader, good fucking riddance.\n\n\nI first joined back in circa 2013, when it was more of a support group that was against the idea that men must get married and have kids to have a successful life, or \"man up\" and be some kid's new daddy.  It was about breaking that mold and personally accepting that its ok to live your own life, never feel pressured to get married, and have your own cool hobbies.  \n\nThere was \"women hating\" bullshit posts even then, usually from bitter divorced men too immature to move past the \"anger phase\", which I would downvote and move on.  It wasn't what the sub was about.\n\nAs time went on, more people joined, specifically from the T_D and Conservative crowds.  All of the thoughtful posts were blasted out by \"hurr durr women bad\" and \"women belong in the kitchen\" trash posts.  Downvoting or reporting for removal was futile.\n\nEventually, I got banned last year because I didn't jump on the Greta Thunburg hate train with a comment like \"imagine being scared of a teenage girl\".  It was long over due that I unsubbed and, since then, I haven't missed it one bit.  I outgrew it as a person and had 'gone my own way'.\n\nIt really evolved into a trash sub and I'm glad they're quarantined.\n\nEdit: If there's a lesson to be learned from this, subreddits that focus on a specific topic and the moderators fail to moderate distractions/counterproductive posts, it will eventually turn into a shithole subreddit.",
            "You know, it's funny. When I originally heard of MGTOW, I thought it was a great idea. Society has spent more than a century redefining women's gender roles, but hasn't done much for men leading to a list of contradictions 3 miles long. I grew up having this idea of what a \"real man\" was being ground into me intentionally and it was toxic as hell. I managed to survive and spent years redefining what it should mean in light of what a \"real woman\" means now. I've never really seen anyone else do that so I was excited by the prospect.\n\nAs an example, a while back I had a conversation with a girl having problems in her relationship. He was raised with the old idea that men are obligated to be the breadwinner and take care of his family. She was in school, had money, and he was broke and couldn't afford to go see her a few states away. She offered to pay for his plane ticket, and he refused. Society has encouraged her to achieve anything she wants, but forgot to tell him it's ok to not live up to that standard, and allow the woman to care for or provide for him. Instead he was having a pavlovian response of shame for failing (no, not simple pride) and it was hurting their relationship.\n\nBy all rights, it should be just as ok for a man to be a house husband or stay at home father just as much as for a woman to be a stay at housewife, or sahm. Equality should mean equality, but it still doesnt. Not really anyway. I could give other examples, but it would be kinda redundant. Things are changing obviously, just at a really slow pace.\n\nAs it stands I try to push for equality in my own life as much as possible, and it has worked out pretty well for me. I was really dissapointed when I found out how many incels were part of MGTOW, and what it really stood for.",

This episode pissed me off. The amount they downplay covid and act like it\u2019s nothing is infuriating. I work at a hospital, and it\u2019s bad. I have a friend that is a nurse in New York, and she said they had 80 people die in one day at her hospital. There was dead bodies scattered across the halls and it was the craziest thing she had ever seen. The part that really got me was when Brenda talked about the guy at the coffee shop telling him he can\u2019t come in without a mask. Rich \u201ccomedian\u201d Brendan Schaub knows the truth, not the thousands of scientists and doctors that are in charge of dealing with this. What made me sad was that Joe was just agreeing with all the bullshit Brendan was saying.\n\nand finally\n\n>First 2 minutes and it's already too much for me to handle.\n\n>Joe is a walking and talking contradiction. Acting like the virus is nothing bad.... while he's testing himself on a daily.\n\n>Still not getting the point as well. It's not about the morality rate. We knew about the mortality rate being relatively low when compared to certain more deadly viruses. The problem lies in the strain on the fucking health care with ICU's being overcrowded. You don't need to die to be in an ICU. There's still too much people being admitted into hospitals due to Covid. Most of them will survive, but that isn't the problem. They still need fucking care. Open up everything, get more ''non deadly'' cases... but treat them where? In the overcrowded hospital? I wonder if there's a way to prevent those overcrowded hospitals... oh wait, a lockdown maybe? Hmm I wonder.\n\n>Just keep confirming your own bias by sucking on Elon's cock, who's a genius engineer and CEO and not a fucking virologist. While he's worrying about his business and money.\n\n>Edit: and before someone tells me a lot of hospitals are ghost towns and because of that it isn't that bad. I'm referring to ICU's, ICU's aren't a bottomless pit. The hospitals, that are ghost towns atm, are also in partial lockdown because a lot of regular care (non-urgent) has been postponed. I've also seen this as a anti-covid argument, so damn silly. People don't seem to want to look up the reasoning behind something. ''So we're in a pandemic? They say on the news that hospitals are overcrowded but the hospital around the corner of my home is a ghost town! So it must be fake news!'' Idiots jump to conclusions and listen to their favorite idiot podcast host to give it meaning, while they all end up in an endless loop of misinformation and ignorance.\n\n\n\nThe podcast episode is a shitshow of misinformation. Both multimillionaires arguing the importance of opening up so they can make more money. \n\nHere is a small snippet to bring some context to how much of a big idiot Brendan Schaub is when it comes to COVID-19  - https://streamable.com/xc94xb\n\nWe have pictures like this - https://i.redd.it/0lr2uvpahox41.png\n\nAnd other threads popping up like this one: \n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/JoeRogan/comments/gg9uqm/jre_mma_show_95_with_brendan_schaub/",

I'll assume most readers here are familiar with the QAnon movement, but if you want to see a pretty decent summary from an insider's view, here's a copypasta from a fervent Q believer on Conspo: [Q anon is a military PSYOP and it has been a HUGE SUCCESS!](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/jq4zc7/has_qanon_reacted_to_the_election/gbk76uh?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nThroughout the last three years, Q has continually reiterated to his followers that Trump is the one man who can save America, and that his re-election is assured despite the powerful Cabal which opposes him. Q has pretty consistently focused on the inevitability of Trump and America's salvation, while the actual QAnon movement itself is more a \"big tent\" group and has factions who believe John F. Kennedy Jr. faked his death and is working undercover for Trump, or that Trump will soon unveil proof of alien life or an infinite energy source, or that all debt globally will soon be erased and initiate a post-scarcity society, or that Hillary Clinton and other key Dems torture small children to drain adrenochrome from their brains to give them eternal youth. But despite these wide-ranging beliefs, devotion to President Trump has been a constant, and the movement has been united in the belief that his 2020 re-election is guaranteed.\n\nAccordingly, the events of the last week have proved problematic for the movement. I pulled up more than a dozen threads in r/Conspiracy discussing the fallout, with comments ranging from Q doubters saying \"told you so\", to former believers saying they've lost faith, to ongoing believers reassuring them that this is all part of The Plan, and they have zero doubt the President will soon take decisive action (theories vary as to what) to claim his victory. Let us dine on popcorn:\n\n* [First, There are no qanon guys. There is Q then there are anons who get the bread, who bake the bread, who leave the crumbs and who provide the sauce.

Do you mean to say that you think he will win in  court (btw they all keep getting thrown out for lack of evidence of  election fraud)? If nothing significant happens, Biden will be sworn in  and be president on Jan 20. **Q predicted Trump would win the election and  carry on with the whole plan to jail pedos (aka The Storm), arrest  Hillary, etc. but that clearly can\u2019t happen now.

I created a user account called Mr.X (this is when tailor made fan-websites with really dedicated forums were still big) and slowly convinced almost everyone that I was either Matt Bellamy or a friend of theirs called Tom Kirk who does all their multi-media/BTS stuff, I'd post vague shit smattered with interesting references and plausible things that only the Band could know (but that you could work out if you added 2 other known things together) I'd post 10 second audio clips of instrumental 'Demos' that I made and called them things like 'Church of the Sub-Genius' and 'Secret Wars'. Once you find out how easy it is to fool people you become quite invested in it and addicted to the status/power of people hanging on your every word, i'd research everything I could, the more I gathered the more convincing I came across. I didn't even think about how it would actually play out in the end, It was all about the next post, become more and more convincing but in very psychologically subtle and machiavellian ways, I'd see more and more people buy into what I was saying, as a creative exercise it was exhilarating. This all resulted in the things I was 'teasing' being featured in the NME as part of a big profile piece of the Band and what they were up to. The beauty was that, because I had consistently demonstrated so much knowledge about goings on, the naysayers seemed like the uninformed ones, which legitimised my whole operation even more. Any way it all came to an end when the album was released and nothing I teased had come to fruition, the fan-base were super pissed and someone even found out who I was and messaged my Mr.X account with my real name. I expect something similar will happen with Q."

Capital gains tax is how the poor thinks the upper class lowers their tax burden. In actuality, it's how the upper-middle class lowers their tax burden. It's mostly professionals and stemlords in high CoL areas who are making just above six figures getting a portion of their salary from shares of their company. It halves their tax burden if they hold their investment for a while, which is nice, but it's not even close to the pro league in terms of dodging taxes. If this tax wants to make some real revenue, it should apply the higher rate to everyone making six figures or more.

            "Okay someone explain this to me. Because I\u2019ve seen people claim it\u2019ll be taxed based on income, which is fair. However, the worry in the agriculture community is how will this affect us? \n\nLet\u2019s say our farm comes on hard times, and need to sell land. Before, we had what\u2019s called a stepped up basis. Whatever the price was for the original purchaser is the \u201cbasis\u201d, and when you went to sell they adjust it or step it up to the current market value. So you sell the land, your basis is the current price, meaning avoiding capital gains taxes. In large it was done this way because farmers are land rich and cash poor. We prefer farming the land, as opposed to selling it all and cashing out. Many farms are worth tens of millions, but you sure wouldn\u2019t know it because the money isn\u2019t in a bank account. It\u2019s like living on top of an oil deposit but not being allowed to drill. \n\nHere\u2019s the worry, if the stepped up basis goes away, that will suck but farmers will deal with it. But, will the capital gains from the sale of that land be considered income? And thus put the farmer at the 39.4% tax rate? It doesn\u2019t take much land at this point to get to a million. \n\nLet\u2019s say the farmer is in Iowa. They sell a quarter of land, which is 160 acres. They\u2019re needing to pay for a family member to live in a nursing home, for an example. The farmers ancestors bought that land for $5 an acre in the early 1900s. The value of it now is exactly the land average in Iowa of $7560. With the stepped up basis, they\u2019d be showing no gain on the land, thus paying no capital gains tax. Without, they\u2019re looking at $7555 x 160 acres. That\u2019s $1,208,800 they owe the new capital gains tax on. That\u2019s $476,276.20 in taxes they now owe off a sale of land. \n\nIs my math here right? Or do I have something wrong that the gains tax would be based on a previous tax report? Also, I have not had the chance to read into this proposal, will this be including the rumored unrealized gains tax that\u2019s been floating around? For anyone who knows what that is, it\u2019ll be damning for family farms within a generation.",

But now, an elected official whose controversy is public record and covered accurately by several respectable newspapers, gets a lot of wide-ranging special treatment because they are actually employed by Reddit. And that employment is not being questioned.\n\nThe opinion du jour these days is \"accountability\". Plenty of people in high places, like those who'd represent Reddit, would love to see a burger flipper or a bus driver \"held accountable\" for saying something offensive on social media, and that us plebians on the web should watch our backs and forget about tolerance or free expression as values. But when it's one of them, they suddenly deserve a right to be forgotten. Hypocrits.\n\nFor what it's worth, I think Reddit should take a harder line against doxxing, witch hunting, and public shaming because it makes the site a negative place and less enjoyable for all. But on the flip side, if a more realistic, fair standard for what constitutes these things did exist here, I am certain that this incident would cross the line.

Memes specifically about videogames would not be allowed as not every teenager...plays videogames.\n\nUser creates a petition post calling for all users of r/teenagers to not post on Monday as a protest against the new rules. Gains 10k+ upvotes before being removed. Users began to realise that the post was removed and were very upset, creating [posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/cp0ua7/mods_removed_the_petition_to_not_post_on_monday/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) about it's removal. \n\n> IF THEY TAKE ONE DOWN 2 MORE SHALL TAKE THEIR PLACE!\n\n> CORRUPTION\n\n> Those in power always go to censor the youth first\n\nUser who created the petition post that was removed posted a [response post](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/cp4yzm/they_took_down_my_protest_post_of_10k_upvotes/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) that has gained 90k+ upvotes. Many spinoff subreddits like r/Republic_of_Teenagers and r/Teenagers_Rebellion have spawned as a result of this. \n\nThe mods made a [clarification post](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/cp4a2t/clarification_on_the_recent_announcement_about/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), but users are still upset and still want to protest. Users are now [voting for new mods](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/cp1nmd/we_kind_of_won_the_war/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), with many \"volunteering\" out of the kindness of their hearts to be the head mod. \n\n> Btw, this ain\u2019t a meme. This is a serious rebellion\n\nUsers are apparently going to [mass downvote accounts](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/cp5u1y/im_sorry_little_one/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) that dares post on Monday. Some are now saying [that they won't post ANYTHING](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/cp0tud/you_say_post_nothing_on_monday_i_say_screw_that/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) until the rules are changed back.\n\n> I doubt itll work for even an hour. Someones bound to fuck it up\n\n> > We downvote em\n\nEDIT: Edited the formatting of post and put everything in order so it makes a lot more sense for users just making their popcorn.\n\nEDIT2: Users of r/teenagers who are supporting the mods are spamming so the protest is interrupted. All posts in new at the moment are all being heavily downvoted.\n\nEDIT3: A [change.org petition](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/cow4he/heres_a_petition_to_remove_this_awful_rule/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) has spawned, calling for the rule to be reverted.\n\nEDIT4: u/PillowManExtreme created a great [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/cp8uqb/how_can_we_solve_the_current_crisis/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) trying to figure out a solution to the current issues the subreddit is facing. It's being downvoted by protesting users but I think it's really worth reading.\n\nEDIT5: Still no response from the moderators, although it appears that the sub has for the most part returned to it's normal state.",

People doing some \"basic research\" is how we got to where we are today, where people are believing crack pot demon semen doctors.\n\nYou should trust the consensus of a group of people who went to school for 8+ years to study this specific thing.

The ol' JAQing off method and arguing in bad faith, spreading conspiracy around an already targeted figure when we're currently dealing with a massive anti-vax grift. And of course, trying to phrase that as \"just asking questions bro, it should be people's choice bro.\"\n\nWorse is that he tried to trojan horse it behind the treatment of animals used in medicine (and I don't know the validity of the claims being made). You *know* that's arguing in bad faith. Why? Because if you have a genuine problem with the humane treatment of animals for medicine, buckle the fuck up, because the fabric of our society is stitched together with the meat of animals. Not just food, but for any byproduct that goes into our body. It's an uncomfortable but worthwhile discussion to have. \n\nBut he's not arguing for the ethical treatment of lab animals, just spreading lies. \n\n/pol/ really is concentrated brain rot, my god.",

As long as Vinesauce Joel never does anything stupid I'll be fine. I can't imagine what I'd do if Swede boi turned out to be as bad as Jontron.  \n\n\nEDIT: Well seeing how his comments section is filled with Anti-Vaxxers and now Transphobes I am definitely jumping off the ship.

            "Oh there are loads of worse stuff in that article. Broadly:\n\n* Trump has basically no liquid assets. He has pretty much sold all his stock assets in order to pay off debt, and any time he got money from other sources (such as the apprentice) he used it as a down payment on loans to buy more property. Most of this property is underwater, taking out more and more debt to make payments. It would not surprise me if his net worth is close to being negative.\n* He has been paying his family members \"consulting fees\" in the range of tens-hundreds of millions of dollars and writing those off as loses, which is pretty much the same thing his daddy did with him.\n* Most of his newer businesses, i.e. the golf courses and new real estate projects since 2005 (when he went on a buying splurge with the apprentice money) have consistently lost money before depreciation (the excuse he uses) was even taken into account. His few actually profitable businesses were generally inherited from his father or are from Trump Tower (which is already paid for and as a large building in Manhatten makes good money on rents). \n* There is a bunch of shady dealings with lobbyists using exorbitantly priced rooms/venues from his company for basically no reason. This is  even more extensive than previously thought.\n* His ass got saved by Obama's recession relief package. It allowed him to carry back loses further than two years, which netted him a much needed ~$70 million refund. In addition it allowed him to defer paying taxes on canceled loans from the recession (which are normally taxed as income) until 2014, which would have pushed his business under if he had to eat those taxes during the recession. \n* The audit he is currently under is related to the above. To claim the refund from 2005-2007 he used him abadoning his stake in his Atlantic casinos to count as his loss. However in the tax code you can only do this if you receive nothing else from the business or bankruptcy, but he received a 5% stake in the restructured company after the bankruptcy, meaning all those refunds+interest would come due (~100 million dollars).\n\nSmall note on where the NYT is getting this from, it seems they got most of the tax information from someone high up in the Trump Organization, as they do not have Trump's full personal finances, just which business losses he was claiming for those finances. That being said something like 95% of Trumps assets are in the Trump Organization, so this is a distinction without much of a difference. It really means all we are missing is an actual approximation of his net worth. \n\nTL:DR- The Trump Organization is a giant Rube-Goldberg machine juggling a bunch of flaming chainsaws, passing debt around and declaring losses while stuffing the few profits into tax havens to keep the business afloat, and virtually every business venture Trump has gotten into has failed and is underwater, and when that debt comes due he is screwed.",

Jo is a brilliant (and very eccentric!) woman who was extremely passionate about the atrocities being committed against the Uyghur's at the hands of the CCP. She used to take regular field trips out to Xinjiang so she could observe directly and campaign against the human rights abuses being done to them, and you could tell whenever she spoke on it how close this issue was to her heart.*\n\n*Well, after almost 30 years of being a nuisance, in March of this year, [Jo was one 9 UK politicians and academics targeted by the CCP for the crime of \"lies and disinformation\"] (https://thechinacollection.org/statement-sanctioned-scholar-jo-smith-finley/), having political sanctions placed on them banning them from ever travelling to Chinese-claimed territories and seizing property/freezing any assets they may have in China.*\n\n*Rest assured, everything that they're saying about what China is doing to them is factual.*",

It\u2019s a lie. \n\nTrussell also states in that clip I mentioned earlier that these right wingers are just using Joe to spread themselves, and I believe that\u2019s 100% correct. By seeming relatively likable on Joe\u2019s podcast, it exposes people to these idiots with such fucked up ideology without delving into their actual racist or extremist ideas. Then, later on, they can slowly dip their toes into the horrible narratives being pushed.\n\nI 100% believe Joe is a means to an end for these people. He\u2019s played a part (although unintentionally) in the radicalization of many fragile people.",
            "He makes it seem like he's just the cool reasonable guy who is moderate but he is going further to the right. Also if absolutely no one of an entire gender are interested in your show, it may be a crap show.",
            "The problem for me with the JRE is that it\u2019s a mixed bag.\n\nI genuinely used to like the show because Joe has interesting guests from time to time and you can learn a lot of cool things through these relaxed conversations he has with people. Some of the best episodes are with sleep doctors, neurobiologists, a few athletes, historians, journalists, scientists. That\u2019s the good side.\n\nThe bad side is that the good side is a minority of the show. The majority is him having a million comedians on who bring in false information, his meathead friends who just nod and agree with everything he says, or the far too common uninformed person who spouts these ideas without any actual data or proof of what they are saying. \n\nPeople get mad at me all the time because they say \u201cit\u2019s his show he can have whoever he wants on\u201d. Ok fine. But he can\u2019t pretend he\u2019s not creating his own echo chamber of ideas. Then, when he completely does a 180 on the whole \u201cI\u2019ll never be censored because I work for myself\u201d no one bats a fucking eye. It\u2019s fine he sold out, I can\u2019t think of anyone who wouldn\u2019t for $100M. But to not even criticize him for it just goes to show that a lot of his fans don\u2019t want to admit what they know about him. He\u2019s a bit of a phony.",
            "A lot of people may disagree, but maybe it's blessing in disguise that Joe got involved with spotify. This is a way for Joe to be held accountable when he spouts misinformation, and misinformation does cause harm. Just the other day, Joe spread the lie that leftists and antifa people are causing the wildfires in Portland. The Portland authorities had to get involved to debunk that claim. Although Joe did apologize, he already caused damage, and his fans are already defending him and saying he shouldn't have apologized. Spotify doesn't want to get sued for defemation and lying, so it's not a surprise that they are going to input standards to make sure this doesn't happen again. It does make me nervous that we are putting a little bit of faith in a capitalist corporation to hold Joe accountable, but honestly, he needs it.",
            "You want that big money you gotta put up with big money's requirement you offend no one and be fully 100% marketable at all times. \n\nYou see this with true crime and Parcast, where they do very workable, reasonable episodes that are careful to never say anything that would rile someone up. Listening to one of their podcasts is like eating cheerios for breakfast...it's there, it's fine, but it isn't ever going to be amazing or life-changing.",
            "Who would have thought the people who thought Joe Rogan was an intellectual were mentally unstable? It\u2019s okay to like the JRE but he\u2019s a glorified talk show host, not some intellectual freethinker"

In the sub, your hair is considered curly if it has any texture to it, including the slightest wave. There is a rule, \u201cno curly gatekeeping.\u201d An OP complained that there is curly gatekeeping on Twitter, as if this was news. Seriously, anywhere but in r/curlyhair it is generally accepted that your hair has to have a certain curl to be curly.\n\n>[if your hair doesn't go into spirals, it's not curly. The wavy community NEEDS to come to terms with that](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/csf0eh/tried_to_look_into_2c_curl_tips_on_twitter_and/).\n\nThis post was met by a comment detailing how the subreddit is actually unwelcoming to black women because\n\n>[\u201cwhen it comes to black women speaking on their own personal movement (the natural hair movement) you guys tend to step in where you\u2019re not needed... to people on the outside, when Black women do what the woman in the tweet did, it can seem like gatekeeping, but i urge you guys to realize that Black women have always been kept out of things that seem basic to you guys... it\u2019s even more exhausting to enter a place that claims to be for everyone with curly/textured hair, but still feel like an outsider when you see people try to downplay (and sometimes ignore) discrimination that you know you and everyone who looks like you faces.\u201d](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/csf0eh/tried_to_look_into_2c_curl_tips_on_twitter_and/exfbhcf?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)\n\nThus the mods decided to recruit new moderators to address the lack of diversity in the sub, specifically why black women don't post to the sub. My name is no longer on the [announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/faks7v/meta_welcome_new_moderators/) but my proof is all the [mod flairs](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/fwyf2z/maybe_no_one_will_see_but_still_doing_cgm_for/fmufq4d?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) I used in the past.

Everyone on the sub uses their own definition of big chop, whether it is a long hair to shoulder length hair cut or longer than 3 inches. But in the natural hair community, it means going from relaxing curly hair straight to cutting off all the relaxed hair \u2013 you're left with a few inches at most and skipped transitioning into your natural hair texture. I was on board for correcting the sub about this term and educating people about the natural hair movement.\n\nSo the mods made this [post about education](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/ffexc7/meta_an_open_conversation_an_open_dialogue/). I wrote the parts referencing a book. The post talked about how POC suffer through discrimination because of their hair.

Sure they may have been bullied and that\u2019s valid, but they shouldn\u2019t be the face of the movement. They can sympathize and stand in solidarity, but the mods/posts here being majority non-POC is a huge issue and inaccurate representation of the people. no one is gatekeeping curly hair, any race can have it. but the representation of the movement SHOULD be \u201cgate-kept\u201d in a way. you can\u2019t have majority white people being the face of a natural POC hair movement because they don\u2019t know the struggle. I for one am a POC with wavy hair, I don\u2019t claim it to be curly. I don\u2019t take up space talking about the \u201cstruggles of acceptance\u201d I faced or whatever the fuck.

I am white and have wavy hair. I personally do not feel a white woman with curly hair shouldn\u2019t be able to call her hair curly. Because that\u2019s what it is. Yes, POC often have different hair types and textures than a white woman, and I have extreme empathy and sadness for the struggles and discrimination they have endured and do endure still. No white woman will ever fully be able to understand those struggles I\u2019m sure. I do however believe that curly hair is a hair type that any race can have.

This action was [noticed](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/fu5vya/why_all_the_hate_about_a_big_chop/).\n\nThen came this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/fuwavw/meta_rule_changes_for_inclusivity_include/) which made respecting cultural terms a rule and included an [infograph](https://i.imgur.com/a1fdnBW.png) on whether your haircut is a big chop or not, and at the end it asked if you were a POC. I was now confused, none of the mods told me we were going to moderate race. When I mentioned this was not going to be well received they told me we'll cross that bridge when we get there.

Big chop has been used by women all over the planet to mean chopping off a large amount of hair. Anyone, ANYONE telling another person they can't use 'natural hair' nor 'big chop' is an absolute moron. I do not care what anyone's race is but stating those words are \"culturally sensitive\" is a crock. Calling a Negro the \"n\" word is wrong, calling a Caucasian the \"c\" word is wrong and so forth and so on with the other three human races but saying you had a big chop cause you cut off 12 inches of hair is not wrong no matter your race.\"Hair journey\" is one of the more dumb terms I've heard.

They claimed their implementation was open to change but everyone who said just remove the part about needing to be black was told no. When I talked about discrimination in latinx communities, the mods said they couldn't fix it and would not give the same shout out they gave black people to latinx, instead pushing that latinx has anti-blackness as well.\n\nThis has already led to some cringe.

At the risk of posting drama I'm involved with, I'll try to keep it short and neutral. I decided to finally voice my concerns, that this was getting a bit racist and that we shouldn't moderate race. At first, they didn't seem to understand why I was against it even though I could use the terms as someone with black ancestry. They then told me that racism was about power and that you can't be racist towards white people. When they asked me to define racism, I showed them the dictionary definition of racism, to which I was told, \u201cYou know how many racists show me that everyday?\u201d And then one of the main two mods told me to talk only to her since it was too painful to two of the new mods to hear from me (one of them is inactive, I had forgotten they were a mod). After reciting a bunch of pre-made responses, she repeatedly asked me \u201cwhy is racism so bad?\u201d and  shot down every reason I gave as wrong even when I started linking articles about racism. She said this is no different than not allowing people with straight hair to post on r/curlyhair although my stance was as long as it is on topic it should be fine. When I asked about the black people who said they wanted this, the only direct feedback I was given was from one of the new mod's discord. I didn't actually see any PMs from black people wanting this. And when I said not all black people want this, I was told that I was cherry-picking.

            "The comment about black hair being political is accurate, and it\u2019s a much more meaningful and sensitive topic within the black community for wholly legitimate reasons, but the sub is r/curlyhair, not r/blackhair or even r/naturalhair. That\u2019s what gets me. Black people *don\u2019t* have a monopoly on \u201ccurly hair\u201d as a broad category, and if the sub is mostly American (as is the case with most of Reddit), then yeah, you would expect like 60-70% of the posts to be by white people. I absolutely understand and even agree with the desire to increase diversity, but I disagree that gatekeeping and outright alienation is the way to accomplish it.\n\nThe infographic may as well be a parody of itself. It reminds me of that \u201cyourfatfriend\u201d account where it\u2019s so deep up it\u2019s own ass that you can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s all a big troll taking advantage of people who are earnestly trying to be \u201cwoke\u201d.\n\n(Though, at the risk of being hypocritical, I do think some people\u2019s \u201cwavy\u201d hair is reeeeeaaaaaally testing the definition of even wavy, let alone curly... and the ones who talk about being bullied over their hair like it\u2019s *discrimination*?)\n\nAnyway I\u2019m just going to sit here and wait for them to devolve into colorist arguments about what qualifies as \u201cblack *enough*\u201d. It reminds me of a time that Halsey (a singer) caught flak for growing out her natural hair which is dark and distinctively curly. People accused her of wearing a wig and of cultural appropriation, saying she isn\u2019t allowed to have hair like that because she\u2019s white... except 1. It was literally her own hair, growing out of her head in its natural state, and 2. Her father is black and it\u2019s no big secret that she\u2019s biracial, even if she is white passing.",

            "I'm a native american descendant who looks white but practices the religion and takes part in my culture. I was raised with the rule of not cutting my hair--my dad's mother had hers down to her feet when she died. When my dad lost his mother, he began cutting his hair because it was something that connected them. He felt such intense sorrow about it that he felt like a different person, so he decided to keep his hair short to signify that. \n\nWhen I lost him, I went a few years and my hair stayed long. I got married with long hair. But it never felt right. My personal connection with my hair was gone because of my grief. I was something different because I had lost my dad, my connection to our long hair tradition, and that meant I understood how he felt. So I cut it off and have kept it short since. I love my hair short, and I feel a personal connection to it. When I cut it, I burn it as is tradition, but I cannot fathom growing it long again--it connected me to the memories of my father and he took a part of me with him. \n\nAnyway, when I did, I referred to it as \"the big chop\" because I was going from hair that had NEVER been cut as per my culture, to chin length. It was a spiritual thing to cut my hair, and it continues to be part of my daily mourning of my dad. It's how I represent his loss effecting my life. None of my leaders see this as wrong, and they considered the phrase accurate. \n\nHowever, I had a friend of a friend tell me I wasn't allowed to say \"big chop\" because it was a black phrase. She explained it to me and I understood where she was coming from, and in my culture you never put chemicals in your hair, so I understood and related to the struggle of having people judge you for natural hair choices. I was weird because I didn't get highlights or dyes or use straighteners and blowdriers, things like that. Cutting her hair was a way to reclaim who she was and reconnect to her family line--I loved that. It was so familiar. My cutting of my hair was my connecting with my father's spirit because every time I cut it and burn it, I offer it up to mother earth as a representation that he's still with me in my heart. \n\nHowever, when I told her this, that my use of the phrase was of similar nature, because it was a discussion of cultural values, she told me I was \"too white\" to have those. As if black people were the only people who were allowed to have cultural significance in their hair. As if she had decided that my upbringing and practice didn't matter because I look whiter than her stereotype for a Native American. And let me tell you, I get that shit enough from white people. I don't need other minorities telling me that I'm not allowed to be a fuckin minority. \n\nI understand the phrase has a cultural significance for you guys, I do, but it does for me too.

            "I joined that subreddit around 4 years ago when I started trying to learn a lot more about my hair. For reference, I'm a Mediterranean guy with 2c/3a hair. I learned some things at the beginning, mostly about sulfates, silicones, etc. I also saw a lot of bad tips, such as not scratching your scalp in the shower (which would leave my scalp incredibly itchy for the next day).\n\nI tried to get involved a bit, but I noticed a heavy bias toward attractive white women. If a person was attractive (especially a girl), they'd be voted to the top, even if their hair wasn't that nice. There would also be some pity posts of people not doing well at all, but upvoted to be nice for trying. I was on the sub to look at and learn about hair. I would see very nice hair pics barely upvoted because the person wasn't very attractive at all. Also, again, there was the bias toward women, but I understand that since hair care is more closely followed by women.\n\nI eventually unsubbed when I realized 80% of the stuff on that sub is bullshit. People were literally cracking eggs on their heads and getting upvoted for it. Instead of blow drying on cold and low, $80 diffuser attachments were being advertised. Terrycloth towels and sulfates are the devil, and you're a spawn of Satan if you even look at them.\n\nAfter some time, I actually undid a lot of my learning from that sub. I went back to silicones. Turns out a lot of that non-water soluble shit actually provides some good hold for your hair which is really helpful if you have short/medium hair that you need hold for. Ya, my Devacurl gel formed nice curls, but fuck your hair if there's the slightest breeze of wind. Frizz-galore. Also, super shiny. My hair looks far better with higher-hold products with silicones in them, and I get way more compliments. I kept the silicone-free conditioner and the no-poo (twice a week), as well as a bit of scrunching. Forget about the plopping, the s2c, the diffusers, the pineapple, day 2+ hair, silicone-free product, hair t-shirts, and eggs. Fuck eggs in particular. If you crack eggs in your hair, you're dumb. I'm sorry. Eggs are food, not hair product. Your hair isn't a bodybuilder. It doesn't need protein and macros by way of cracking eggs in it.\n\nI checked out the sub once more a couple years later to see what changed and if there was anything of value for me. There wasn't. I don't hate the sub by any means, but there is a lot of silliness that goes on there. People are too hung up about the sacred rules and do-nots.",
            "Tbh I have avoided using those terms for a long time. I understand that as a person of Caucasian descent, I have no clue what it\u2019s like to have my life be made more difficult because of my race, and I never will. After reading about the history of the beauty industry\u2019s systematic attempts to quash ethnic beauty, I was heartbroken about what ethnic women have had to endure over their hair. It\u2019s awful. \n\nThe stigma against wavy/curly hair IS rooted in racism full stop. I can talk about my own hair journey but not the natural hair movement, and that\u2019s as it should be. I think sometimes people need to remember that it\u2019s okay to take a backseat and just listen to those who have struggled with injustice their entire lives. Just like I expect men to take a backseat in the discussion of gender equality, I take a backseat when it comes to issues of race.",

I know a lot of women going on their natural hair journey after years of processing, and I picked up the whole 'big chop' thing as an associated term but when I saw white girls who have been bleaching their hair to death finally embracing their curls, I'm all YASS GIRL DO IT.\n\nAdmittedly, I've done the whole 'well that's more wavy than curly' bit (think: Patrick Bateman 'your'e more strawberry blonde, aren't you?') but I never was like THIS B*TCH doesn't even KNOW! \n\nI thought we were all a community of curly hair of ALL textures, willing to create and share a common language with which to discuss a hair type that is FINALLY getting serviced. \n\nGuess I was wrong.",

            "Wow, this is.... thorough. Great job, op!\n\nI mean, sure as someone with really kinky 4bc hair I probably wouldn't join just scrolling down and looking at the photos commonly posted or reading about the \"curly girl method\" (which, being honest, would probably destroy my hair. Pineappling? Scrunching. Noooo thank you.). It just doesn't look, \"afro/kinky hair\" friendly. Sure there might be a few posts, but why join that sub with a few posts from black people (that don't really seem helpful) when I can go to another sub catered to my hair and people who also share the same texture, you know? \n\nI  also don't think this was a good way to attract potential subscribers or educate people. \n\nPersonally *I* wouldn't want to talk about black hair politics (which IS a thing. Black, afro textured, hair has been \"political\" since slavery and it still is seeing as we still have people getting fired from their jobs over their hair being \"unprofessional\") in a sub full of white and non black POC who wouldn't necessarily understand, would possibly get defensive, and who I would have to educate them all the way through. Basically what the girl was kiiiiiinda saying at first. It's tiring even thinking about it lol. If I wanted to I'll just go to a more niche sub like r/blackladies , r/blackhair , or even r/naturalhair to talk about stiff like this and hope that the sentiments bleed over a little. \n\nTbh, I think with the audience in that sub, I would have opted to walking on eggshells more rather than being so direct just to avoid the sub imploding on itself. I get both sides. Big chop to some people is a very liberating if not a huge social and political term or step for them, so seeing people using the term \"wrong\" I guess can be annoying and to those who take these things more seriously, offensive I guess. For those who still may not get it, those who are taking this movement seriously, it may feel as if people are again taking away from a movement meant for black people and black empowerment. But again, I personally wouldn't use that sub as an education zone because a lot of the people there don't want to be educated in the first place. And you can't force people to learn, they'll just become deflective, if not cold and bothersome. It's not worth the time or the blood pressure lol. \n\nAnyway, someone also telling you you can't use a long time used vague term such as \"big chop\" because it's now suddenly racist must be confusing and would catch almost anyone who hasn't heard of the BHM off gaurd. \n\nIJS, personally if I were a mod who wanted to encourage more black people to join, I would start by posting more black friendly content. Content that wouldn't scare the average black girl who's just trying to find advice away. Even if the posters aren't posting that type content, maybe a mod could have opted to do that themselves. Like post Youtube videos from black Youtubers, post more infographics made for *kinky/afro* hair. Protective styles, afro hairstyles. Hair health methods and videos catered more towards 3c-4c hair. Maaaaybe every once and a while, post a moderated megathread for new opinions on the politics of black hair. If big chop was the issue, maybe come up with a NEW term, then encourage others to use that one instead of big chop(Without banning it of course). Hell, maybe even taking a poll in what some of the black/mixed members would like a to see to feel more included would have been better.",

The angle Isayama took instead, with Eren being just a normal 19-year-old kid who had way too many responsibilities thrust onto him, had to put on an aloof front to distance himself from the people he cared about, and gradually went low-key kinda insane from all the memories blending together combined with the knowledge that he had to force his childhood friends to kill him is a much more believable development of his character. !< I'm not saying the ending's perfect; but, in my opinion, it managed to avoid a lot of the pitfalls that this kind of ending opens up.

            "Obviously the ending was rushed and no one can really argue against that, but at this point getting so upset at it is pointless. There were far worse ways to end the series. Imagine if everyone stood around the main character and just said \"congratulations\" or something, now that would be terrible. Good thing no anime ends like that",
            "...I liked the ending. I thought it was the logical conclusion that the story was building up to. To *not* end it in the way it ended would have been a betrayal of the entire manga's themes and overall message, IMO, so honestly I don't get why so many people hate it so much?

Tbh, I was expecting the ending to be even sadder than it was.",

Wel of course everyone in that sub hates it and has to explain why. \nA podcast a really enjoy gets destroyed in its sub daily for all sorts of terrible reasons.

            "I left that sub because the constant hate was just getting to me. for me this chapter felt like it wrapped things up pretty well. honestly fuck the ship wars and thank you isayama for making every month something for me to look forward to",
            "It helps to understand that first, titanfolk is an echo chamber when they're pissed. \n\nSecond, there are \u201cactive quitters\u201d on there that have been making claims this series has sucked for a while and yet they continue to read, as if they expected the final chapter to meet their expectations and magically fix everything they\u2019ve complained about for the final part of the story. In other words, they were setting themselves up for disappointment but are currently projecting that they cared about the series still, lol. With a mindset like that, no ending would\u2019ve convinced them to change their minds. That said, has any series had a turnaround ending after a pattern of \u201cterrible\u201d chapters suddenly gain back \u201cfans\u201d like this group?\n\nThird, we also have many using game of thrones\u2019 demise as some sort of competition for what series sucks more, even though that is unnecessary and serves to fuel more hate into their chamber. \n\nWhat can we expect now ? I expect many to believe MAPPA will pull a 4d chess move and give them the ending they want. It also helps to understand that a fair chunk of these users spoil the anime-onlys about the manga\u2019s development, further giving you an idea of the characteristics of the vocal minority that have the stage right now. This is what happens when you don\u2019t keep an open mind for an ending and enter an echo chamber where all you hear is \u201cyes! yes!\u201d to oftentimes, theories that are ingrained in delusions or just simply ideas that are held so close to the heart as if they must be true. That said, there are many great users there with well formed theories that didn\u2019t come true, but I wouldn\u2019t expect them to make a giant tantrum over it. I can agree with their dissent, but not to the embarrassing display that the community have put the focus on right now.\n\nFinally, understand that this is still an immediate reaction, and the more \u201ccleaner\u201d criticisms will come in time because, well, this finale needs time to process. I don't expect the hivemind to change their minds, but I expect some things to calm down. This is not a series that is easy to digest in one go. It very much benefits from rereads and there is no one who can claim they've caught onto all the tricks up Isayama's sleeves. That alone means this is an ending that benefits from reflection deeper than immediate feelings. I\u2019ve already found valid criticisms amongst the cesspool, and that\u2019s what I want to learn more about as a sincere fan. If anyone new is reading this brigaded post feels convinced the series sucks, you\u2019ve been successfully convinced by a group of people who never loved (nor understood) the series to begin with and only wanted everything on their checklist fulfilled."

            "Back in 2015-2016,  the mods who ran The\\_Donald were using hacking, using bots, using whatever means necessary, etc., to promote their propaganda and submissions to the front page.   Their endless spams were taking over the front page of Reddit.  It was so annoying to see the front page being filled with their garbage that  I just blocked the subreddit.\n\nThen I remember started reading one admin announcement after another, one warning after another, that the mods of The\\_Donald had been caught botting, cheating and hacking, to push their submissions to the front page.   (I was no longer seeing anything from The\\_Donald on my front page because I had blocked them, but those announcements and warnings still caught my attention.   I thought that, right there and right then, the admins should have shut down the subreddit and perma-ban its entire mod team.   Yet admins kept letting them off, again and again, because The\\_Donald  was the \"sem-official\" subreddit for the GOP presidential nominee (and later the President.) The admins  kept threatening that they would take action, shut down the subreddit and ban its mods, if the admins caught the mods cheating again; but the admins never had the balls to follow through.  At some point, even the mods at The\\_Donald knew the admins were just bluffing and did not have the balls to mess with them, because they felt the President had their back, so they were openly flaunting it, \"yeah, so we hacked Reddit, and we cheated and used bots to rate up our posts , and we broke all your rules.  What are you gonna do about it?\"  ... well, absolutely nothing.\n\nWhich in my mind really undermined the credibility and impartiality of Reddit.  (Kinda like how Twitter does not have the balls to ban Donald Trump after he has openly violated so many rules on Twitter, the same violations that have gotten countless other celebrities banned.)  The irony was, it would have been better for the reputation of Reddit if the admins had not made those public announcements and warnings... and then failed to take actions as they had threatened that they would.  It just made them look weak.  Ever since then, I have thought very little of Reddit and its admins.  I simply have no respect for them.   So that it seemed like the admins are too cowardice to take direct actions, so they have been dismantling The\\_Donald  via indirect means.     While I am thankful that that swamp of a subreddit is being drained, it does not change my mind about the admins.  (Also feel the same way about Twitter.)",

It was deleted and she was blocked because she USED TO BE fat. I was told that FPH is all about hating anything that is, or was remotely fat. Which is fascinating because some of the people I've had giving me shit in that sub's defence, so far I have seen that every single person raising against me, is exactly that. Was, or is fat. So by their own \"standards\" should have never been allowed in that sub as posters or commenters. \n\nFPH is no tragic loss, they don't have some higher, well intended purpose being denied to them.

Back when it was around 40k, the incessant slapfights between it and /r/neoliberal could be safely ignored, but Chapo is getting to a point now where in a year it'll be impossible to ban (or rather, it would be an enormous pain in the ass). The admins don't want a /r/the_donald situation in which /r/chapotraphouse becomes large enough that banning it would render the site temporarily unusable. While Chapo will never be that big in sheer subscriber count, it's one of the most active subreddits for the amounts of subscribers it has; the amount of shitflinging from banning it is therefore amplified.\n\nThe second aspect of this is that chapo is becoming so large that it is capable of effectively \"brigading\" threads without any direct co-ordination on the subreddit. By this I'm referring to stuff like the police dog situation, in which any meaningfully upvoted thread on /r/aww and other \"cute\" subreddits gets a shitload of \"40%\", \"ACAB\", and other anti-cop rhetoric. While screenshots of this often get posted to /r/chapotraphouse, the vast majority of the time this is AFTER the thread has already been \"brigaded\" by chapo users scrolling through /r/all or the specific \"cute\" subreddits. This behavior is not against the TOS, but it is incredibly annoying to /r/aww mods and therefore concerning to the admins, because the \"cute\" subreddits are the easiest to manage and please, and more importantly, the most advertiser friendly. When chapo users fuck that up, there's a problem.\n\nNow I don't want to imply that there isn't TOS violating stuff on /r/chapotraphouse. I don't think anyone denies that. But given the sheer amount of similar stuff on /r/the_donald, /r/libertarian, and elsewhere that goes unpunished, it seems more likely to me that there's other motives at play here. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.\"\n\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/bp39gb/chapotraphouse_gets_a_call_from_the_admins/enofk3k/\n\n\nIn the end, Chapo was becoming a problem because by dint of its sheer size, Chapo users were engaging in stochastic brigading that was pissing off Reddit's cash cows. I don't think quarantining actually solves that issue, but a ban might, and a quarantine leading to a ban is a possibility here.",

Refer to [this list](https://np.reddit.com/r/GoldTesting/comments/3bypzz/amageddon_tracking/) for current data.**\n\n\"Suddenly\" was how it seemed when a bunch of main subreddits were locked, but now the locks are coming in a cascade. I guess this is going by **AMAgeddon** and **Victoria Day**.\n\nHere's some context. The /r/IAmA incident can be discussed [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/3bwgjf/riama_set_to_private_over_mod_firing/). Here's an [explanation](https://np.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bxduw/why_was_riama_along_with_a_number_of_other_large/).\n\nThanks to /u/justcool393 and others for the [live feed](https://np.reddit.com/live/v6d0vi6c8veb).\n\nSorry /u/IT_Wolf, I ran out of room in post so I removed the [neat table](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/3bxjyu/list_of_subreddits_suddenly_going_private/csqyyeb). Some of these subreddits are NSFW, and I have no idea what some are.

I can already tell.\n\nStatements from each default subreddit:\n\n##**Askreddit**\n\n>As a statment on the treatment of moderators by Reddit administrators, as well as a lack of communication and proper moderation tools, /r/AskReddit has decided to go private for the time being. Please see [this](https://www.np.reddit.com/r/IdeasForAskreddit/comments/3bxj7n/megathread_subreddit_shutdown/) post in /r/ideasforaskreddit for more discussion.\n\n##**Gaming**\n\n>Due to an unexpected Reddit administrative personnel change /r/gaming joins a group of default subreddits going dark temporarily in an effort to resolve the situation. Our apologies for any disruption this may cause.\n\n##**Art**\n\n>I've made /r/art and /r/crappydesign private at this moment because I think a protest is in order. I used to mod /r/iama and worked directly with /u/chooter- and I've seen the decline of reddit throughout Yishan and subsequently Chairman Pao's regime. Perhaps all of this is the straw that broke the camel's back. /u/chooter was one of the best employees reddit has ever had- and we as the community need to say- we've had enough.\n\n##**History**\n\n>In light of recent developments in reddit staff change and our own troubles in getting the proper support we need from reddit as a company we are setting this subreddit private. We will open up to the public again once we have figured out what course we want to take in the future. The events of today have contributed to this decision but are not our main reason for taking this action.\n\n##**Movies**\n\n>Due to an unexpected Reddit administrative personnel change /r/movies joins a group of default subreddits going dark temporarily in an effort to resolve the situation. Our apologies for any disruption this may cause.\n\n>Check out /r/flicks in the mean time\n\n##**Science**\n\n>Due to an unexpected Reddit administrative personnel change /r/science is temporarily private so that we can resolve the situation, our apologizes for any disruption this may cause.\n\n##**Videos**\n\n~~Will give a explenation later on.~~ \n\nAfter lengthy discussion, the /r/videos moderators have decided to join several other large subreddits in 'going dark' to protest the lack of communication between the reddit staff and the volunteers who keep the site ticking over.\n\n##**Gadgets**\n\n>In light of recent developments in reddit staff change and our own troubles in getting the proper support we need from reddit as a company we are setting this subreddit private. We will open up to the public again once we have figured out what course we want to take in the future. The events of today have contributed to this decision but are not our main reason for taking this action.\n\nFor further information on this ongoing issue, please consult [this thread](https://www.np.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bxduw/why_was_riama_along_with_a_number_of_other_large/)\n\n#**Books**\n\n~~Will be going dark soon. [More info](https://www.np.reddit.com/r/books/comments/3bxv9i/when_this_post_is_15_minutes_old_rbooks_will_go/)~~\n\nIn response to our users' wishes we have turned the lights off for 24 hours - we will be back online again at 6:30pm PST, 3 July.\n\n##**LeagueofLegends**\n\n/r/Leagueoflegends will not go 'dark' as it not really affiliated to the drama. [More info](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueOfMeta/comments/3bxtyx/mods_stance_on_the_recent_dark_out/)\n\n##**Documentaries**\n\n~~Expected to go down soon.~~\n\nWe have decided to join several other subreddits in going dark to protest the lack of communication between the reddit admins and the volunteers who help keep the subreddits running.\n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience, and hope to be back to our normal state as soon as possible. For an explanation of what is going on, please see this outoftheloop thread. Also - please check out /r/doctalk for discussions on documentaries and for requests!\n\n##**Music**\n\nWe have chosen at this time to set /r/music private. Communication and support between admins and moderators has been deteriorating and basic tools such as moderator tools and modmail are sloppy at best, with constant promise for improvement never coming. Communication has also been lacking as evidenced by today's mishandled firing of /u/chooter. Please see [this](http://redd.it/3bxduw) thread for more information.\n\n##**LifeProTips**\n\nPrivate in protest\n\n##**TodayILearned**\n\nYou learn something new every day; what did you learn today?\n\nSubmit interesting and specific facts about something that you just found out here. (Not really relevant.)\n\n##**DIY**\n\nHas been set to private, no message.\n\n##**Funny**\n\n/r/funny has gone private to participate in the currently ongoing strike regarding communication between admins and moderators. See here for details.\n\n##**Jokes**\n\nUsers, we heard you loud and clear.\n\nAs a statement on the treatment of moderators by Reddit administrators, as well as a lack of communication and proper moderation tools, /r/Jokes has decided to go private for the time being.

I don't think many will take kindly to that. This is a \"fuck you\" gesture from reddit, intentional or not. \n\nIt can go a few ways at this time I think.

I'd keep that in mind as a possibility because I think the way reddit is being run now, they really don't give a shit what their userbase says. And I don't think that should go unpunished.

This also means millions of people have no reason to visit the site, so the number of pageview, and thus ad revenue, will drop significantly. \n\nAs a user driven platform, Reddit has to consider the user's response to change in the site.

We mods are also under an obligation not to allow our subreddits to participate in witchhunts or to link people's personal information/dox, and every thread about this drama is full of people's dox. We have no way of knowing whether or not the accusations are true, but in order for you and us to stay in line with reddit's terms of service, please do not vote in the linked threads, comment in the linked threads, message anyone involved, try to find the real name of the man in the video, post his information, call his employers, etc. Basically if you're trying to \"spread the word\" or get justice for something, don't do it. You will be banned from here and from the entire website.\n\nWatch and enjoy the drama, but do not participate.\n\n[Here is a screenshot of the original post](https://i.imgur.com/Gk7OhBt.png). We are using a screenshot because the original post made it very easy to find out the real names of the people in this video, so please don't link the original or any mirrors of it. The video is of a fight at a restaurant/bar that appears to show a man instigating a fight and then being wrestled into submission.\n\nThe post became massively popular and hit r/all, and the alleged instigator of the fight from the video was identified and his name posted en masse.\n\nThe mods at r/iamatotalpieceofshit began deleting many of the comments on the video, potentially due to doxxing, and finally the whole post itself. \n\nAt some point accusations began cropping up the man from the video had paid the mods to take down the post. Allegedly the mods at IaaTPoS responded to these accusations by [taunting and trolling users](https://i.imgur.com/a4PEFCx.png) and stickying a post about it. (Screenshots of this stickied post are appreciated so we can link it, but PLEASE black out any personal information). The SRD mod writing this post has personally tried to find any proof or backup that they were *actually* paid and cannot.\n\nSoon copies of the post began spreading, many being deleted, and the ones that stayed up having repeated posting of the alleged instigator's name. Posts about the drama itself have become [quite popular](https://i.imgur.com/MbaoULG.png) Once again, we can't link you these because the mods of those subreddits have yet to clean up the doxxing in their comments.\n\nA feedback loop began to form where all the other mods of reddit were accused of participating in a cover up so users tried to post about the drama even more, and this is where we find ourselves now.\n\n/r/iamatotalpieceofshit has been made [private](https://i.imgur.com/RNDvlSB.png) with the message \"Temporarily closed while we take out the trash. Back soon.\"\n\nOnce again, please don't post personal information or link to threads that have it. Your comments will be deleted. We also apologize for the amount of bias in this post since normally writeups have to be totally unbiased, but as mods we wanted to be 100% honest with you about what is actually happening as best we understand it.\n\nUPDATE: \n\nThe subreddit is still private but the message has changed to this\n\n>Temporarily closed to prevent harassment/doxxing. Coming back soon. Watch this video.\n\n>https://old.reddit.com/r/iamanutterpieceofshit/comments/ge2g6w/rich_drunkard_punches_and_headbutts_staff_for_not/\n\nThe original poster of the thread at IaaTPoS has been suspended by the admins for 3 days.\n\nEDIT: An admin got back to me about what counts as doxxing and harassment. Saying his name is not doxxing, but linking to places that show his personal info or direct you to harass him is against the rules. Because the harassment itself has become newsworthy, any news reports you can find will probably link the directions to harass the man. Because of this, even though it is not doxxing to say his name or link news articles, we will be removing them out of an abundance of caution. We take harassment and witchhunting very seriously, so even if you believe this man is awful and deserves justice, SRD will not be the venue for giving out that justice.",

Because of the doxxing, some mods purged their post history and others just flat out deleted their account (example, u/evasionsnake)\n\n\nZeeDownfall is a part of the team and explains what's going on [in this AMA](https://www.reddit.com/user/ZeeDownfall/comments/idlafv/the_ranimemes_breakdown_ama_with_zeedownfall/). You'll noticed that Zee is one of the people that purged their post history. Zee is still in the good graces of the animemes community due to trying to cooperate with them. \n\nBut some people try to [dismiss](https://www.reddit.com/user/ZeeDownfall/comments/idlafv/the_ranimemes_breakdown_ama_with_zeedownfall/g2a2o6r?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) the notion that the mods were truly doxxed, with some [claiming](https://www.reddit.com/user/ZeeDownfall/comments/idlafv/the_ranimemes_breakdown_ama_with_zeedownfall/g2a59ws?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) that the doxxing is being overexagerated.\n\n\n HOLOFAN4LIFE also speaks out [explaining in detail why he is no longer a mod](https://www.reddit.com/user/Holofan4life/comments/idm5bu/clarifying_why_i_was_kicked_off_the_animemes_mod/). \n\n Side note: the community got more pissed today as one of the mods enabled the crowd control setting as an anti brigading measure. This caused a lot of comments to be collapsed in an effort to hide them. The situation was previously made worse when it was revealed that SrGrafo, a mini reddit celebrity, revealed that the mod team treated him horribly, resulting in the Chloe mascot to be replaced with Sachi. Chloe the character migrated to r/chloe.\n\n\nSide note 2: admins have somewhat become involved in this mess. The current pinned post on r/goodanimemes tells users to stop making war memes or else their sub will get banned because of brigading. This rule is not up for debate and in this case, the users agree with the rule change.\n\nSide note 3- da linkster is a mod and apparently threatened to commit suicide on discord over this. Everyone tried to talk him out of it and he's seemingly ok for now\n\nAs of right now, the subreddit is expected to remain closed for the next 2 to 3 weeks. It is highly likely the subreddit will die as even the mod team is internally collapsing. According to Zee, they all think this might be the end.\n\nEdit, ZeeDownfall has just stepped down.\n\nWANT TO CATCH UP ON THE DRAMA?

This situation was weird, started off as a reaction to the ban and then turned towards backlash at the mods over how they handled the situation with them admitting to using bots to \"shadow ban\" users who weren't active before the controversy (not really shadow banding but it achieves the same end goal of users commenting but they don't realise that nobody sees their comments but is still counted by the comment counter), them banning weekly events that focused on one specific character or theme right after promising to not make any changes like that without consulting the community first, etc. R/animemes went from losing 1k per day to losing between 5k to 10k members per day after the mods' actions. And now it turns out that some people took it too far and doxxed the mods, I'm honestly shocked that they didn't inform the community about the doxxing, we only know this isn't some rumour because a mod decided to break the silence after the mods voted to make the sub private despite his disagreement.",

Not to mention the mascot of the \u201cgood\u201d sub being \u201cTrappu-chan\u201d.\n\nThis really comes down to the fact that, despite constantly shouting that \u201ccontext matters\u201d, the user base of animemes was unable to accept that the world outside of anime exists, and in that world the term is regularly used as a slur against transwomen. That is the context in question. \n\nI\u2019m glad the mods are standing their ground, and not giving in to the \u201cfree speech\u201d temper tantrum. I hope that the mods get to use this time to clean up the sub. Hopefully it\u2019ll be a healthier and better place with those who were so deadset on using a slur. \n\nI don\u2019t think that every user of goodanimemes or \u201crevolutionary\u201d is a transphobic bigot, but I do think that they were more than happy to die on a transphobic hill. It\u2019s all incredibly disappointing. I thought that this move would be a positive one, but it instead managed to burn one of my favorite subs to the ground.",
            "Reddit really is becoming its own demise, isn't it.",
            "So for those who is new to this drama and wondering how that word can be a slur, let me explain.\n\nThe word implies that the person who is being described with this word, is deceiving people.\n\nAnd they call transwomen, non-binary or femboys by this slur. However non of those are tricking anyone, in fact they are being more honest with how they look.\n\nIn case of transwomen the word isnt only transphobic, but homophobic as well. It heavily implies that transwomen arent women, but gay men dressed as women trying to deceive straight men into having gay sex with them or for momentarily gay attraction.\n\nAnd if you didnt notice this the word invalidates transgender peoples' identify and calls them gay men. This is the stereotype this word is feeding.\n\nSome animemers said that they only describe fictional people so its not a problem. Well, it is, because people will see the similarity between fiction and reality and begins to call real people by that slur. Also very few characters are actually trying to deceive others using their looks in regular anime and its almost only accurate in hentais, so the word is mostly inaccurately used too.\n\nAn example would be if someone says they only call fictional characters the \"hard R n-word\" not real people so they  cant be racist and so its not a problem.",

I did however, support the revolt when I became aware of certain info. \n\nThe whole ordeal was petty. Mods and users alike. Someone just had to take it that far, huh?\n\n\nThe way I saw it was like the whole consumer group of walmart boycotting everything but specific items. Yeah, the franchise is still getting revenue from the customers but the store would ultimately lose profit from the boycott. In short, don't upset your customers.",
            "Why didnt the mods just do their job and take this up on a case by case basis instead of a blatant ban of the word? Was this some sort of wide spread issue of people *intentionally* using the word as a slur or just trans people from outside looking in, seeing the word, and wanting it banned?\n\nIf its a slur why isnt the word trap banned here or many other subs?",
            "Imma give my view here. This started out because the mods banned the word \"trap\" (a character troupe in which a character is drawn female/extremely feminine but identifies as a guy and exclusively a guy ) people were mad at first and made posts demanding the change reverted since the mods never actually asked for community input neither was the change necessary as anime and the community always had a line drawn between trap and trans characters. The problems got worse when after a couple days nothing changed and screenshots of the mods slogging the community arose. At this point people were just pissed and then the rest were split between karma whores and observers. About a week later people looked into why some of the well liked mods left and it turned out that they left due to bad relations with the other mods  which made it worse. This was the time that I left so I can't provide much else in detail. There were numerous trans people saying the mods were wrong which of course made things worse.\n\nI'll end this off by saying this: the people who doxxed the mods and did shit to them are NOT part of the anime community and are scum. People are too dumb to understand the difference between trap and tran are also NOT part of the community. All I ask is that you kinda just stop using this as a chance to hate on weebs and maybe look into thing before you start slogging millions off thanks\n\nEdit: I should add that I hate the troupe and find it weird how popular it was but still, people are entitled to their likes as long as it isn't morally wrong",

            "This is getting more serious than it has any right to be. Oh my lord.",
            "The whole situation is honestly depressing. The rule change was a somewhat poorly executed attempt by the mods to be more inclusive, but led to a break in the community. I'll admit I supported people against the ban, because it seems pretty irresponsible to expect a community to change immediately and then enforce a blanket ban. Then things turned to a whole debacle involving other subreddits and horrible communication between mods and users. Trust towards the moderators was pretty much discarded after even more missteps on both sides and resulted in this just nuclear explosion of toxicity.\n\nI feel ashamed of the members of the community who would bring this to the level of doxxing and forcing mods off of the website. EvasionSnake was one of the best creators of oc content in the anime community and the loss of them hits really hard. Even though I think the ban was a bad idea, no way can I support what the mods have been through. I just hope that the community I've had a lot of fun with can fix things and be better.",

Apparently 24yr old Bulgarian actress Maria Bakalova, playing the character of Borat's daughter, claiming to be a conservative Eastern European journalist, met with former NYC mayor and Trump personal attorney Rudy Giuliani (age 76, thrice-divorced). During the encounter she took him to her hotel room (filled with hidden cameras) where they had a scotch and chatted, and at some point Rudy lay down on the bed and stuck his hand down his pants. Following which Borat ran into the room in an outrageous drag costume and shouted \"she's 15, she's too old for you!\" Rudy realized it was a setup and called the police, who concluded no crime had been committed.\n\nThe issue has been hotly debated over the last couple days, as to whether Rudy did anything wrong or this is just planting rumors, knowing that the initial shock will outweigh any later debunking. There are some allegations of hypocrisy about rumor-planting, particularly as this is coming during the same week while Rudy is claiming to have incriminating information allegedly found on Hunter Biden's laptop, which is burning up the conservosphere but meeting skepticism elsewhere.\n\nEven on the sub r/Conservative, with 737 comments and 1.5k updoots, not everyone is thrilled with how America's Mayor is coming across on this issue.

Perhaps, reddit admins thought they could help prevent any shooting from occurring by banning the sub.

I hate useless arguments that are low key just \t~~about semantics~~ a semantics/lack of clear definitions issue. Some people do it on purpose, others get caught up in it, but it's frustrating either way because it goes nowhere, means nothing, but still riles everyone up. \n\nIt's hard to imagine being so dumb that you'd vehemently argue about something so vague and subjective. These people are foaming at the mouth but can't even define the basic aspects of what they're so gung-ho about. I don't see how the levels of \"badness\" for these things even matter much. The capitol was bad, 9/11 was bad, the Civil War was bad jfc.",

Past lack of women's/black rights, a civil issue, again not an attack on democracy as a whole. \n\nThese fanatics wanted to kill elected officials and install Trump permanently.

As for the other ones, they may have been related to democracy, but most of them weren't \"attacks\" in any real sense. The only events that fit the criteria of being an attack on democracy are assassinations of presidents.",

This is a direct attack on the constitutionally laid out process of counting the electoral college vote and core the principle of American democracy: **the peaceful transfer of power.**\n\nYour political affiliation should be superseded by protecting the peaceful transition of power, which the Capitol rioters used their actions to show they denounce and wish to destroy.\n\nThe criticisms that Biden doesn\u2019t understand or value other acts of war against America are done in ignorance to the context and severity of what happened on January 6th.",

It\u2019s different than rioting. And unless you believe in conspiracies, it\u2019s different than 1 person killing a president.

            "Oh good, a topic tangentially related to my dissertation. Time to wade in as an almost historian who focuses on censorship. \n\nThe attack on the capitol was not the worst attack on American democracy since the Civil War. It just seems that way to established liberal white people because it\u2019s one of the first times we (white liberals) have been exposed to a threat- or rather, the metaphor of a threat- that could plausibly impact our participation in democracy, should it evolve from a metaphorical and illegal act into an actual and openly legal one. \n\nI would argue instead that the worst \u201cattacks\u201d on democracy are the worst because they are sustained by the state and essentially unchallenged even by those who pay lip service to the evil nature of those sustained \u201cattacks:\u201d Japanese internment during World War II, Jim Crow, the long term oppression of indigenous populations, mass incarceration of black men, and near criminal negligence of the state in the face of both the crack epidemic and the AIDS epidemic. All of those things have not only limited the civil liberties of large, marginalized swathes of the population that our democracy is supposed to ensure, but work or have worked to prevent these same populations from participating in democracy- not only by making voting harder, but by failing to educate in a way that leads to informed voting, and by providing no upward social mobility to ensure better representation and visibility in our democratic politics. All of these things should make us at least as angry as the capitol attack does. \n\nOther \u201cattacks\u201d on democracy I think are dangerous because, unlike the attack on the capitol, they succeeded or succeed in impeding genuine participation through social or political pressure, or because they interfered/interfere with the democratic process:\n\n-McCarthyism\n-Russian intervention in the 2016 election \n-The abuse of mass surveillance by the NSA\n-and finally, a weird and perhaps too localized one, but the introduction of apps that consolidate an individual\u2019s voting records and registration -gathered and reported imperfectly, I should add- to facilitate social pressure around voting. I get the idea in theory, and think voting is important, but it lends itself very easily to abuse. I saw people publicly shame others for voting in a way they inferred from their party registration (that ended up being wrong) or to bully others into voting under with the clear intent to pressure them vote in one direction. Or sometimes to tell people they shouldn\u2019t vote based on their registration history with an opposing party. Is it legal? Sure. But it\u2019s really not in the spirit of the privacy we\u2019re ostensibly afforded in voting.",

But since it was Trump, and not Clinton, the conspiracy theorists sweep it under the rug. They could have discussion for YEARS about this if they were willing to be at least a little bipartisan.",

            "r/conspiracy is a shithole for sure, but this whole Epstein thing reeks of suspicious shit. You\u2019ve got some of the most powerful men in the world connected to this guy, including 2 US presidents and a bunch of millionaires and billionaires. Plus he had just tried to kill himself 3 weeks ago, and was most definitely gonna expose a bunch of his pedo buddies, so the fact that this dude wasn\u2019t on camera 24/7 with at least 1 armed guard looking at him makes zero sense. I want to know why they thought it was a good idea to take him off suicide watch.",
            "It's a shame /r/conspiracy is completely compromised by Trumptard-loving mods, and only Clinton-blaming anti-Clinton theories will be allowed to survive. Anything anti-Trump will be buried, shilled, removed for rules violations, etc. \n\nI used to love talking conspiracy theory, I was an Art Bell fan back in the 90s and 00s.

            "According to recent news we know that he was taken off of suicide watch around Thursday. Approximately a week ago he attempted suicide by consuming painkillers and alcohol which is what led to suicide watch to begin with.\n\nSuicide watch typically lasts a lot longer than a week. Especially under these circumstances. Prisoners who attempt suicide typically don't get released from suicide watch (which is generally solitary confinement) after upwards a month. \n\nThere is absolutely something unusual about this. Given the fact that he nearly succeeded in his prior attempt they knew he was at high risk of self inflicted injury. Yet for some reason they took him off near immediately only for him to kill himself just 2 days later?\n\nThis entire situation is deeply layered in controversy and potential foul play that anything is possible. Something leads me to believe that Epstiens sudden suicide will be a conspiracy theory passed down through generations. I hope we have answers before then, but knowing that there are powerful, politcal, and wealthy people who are trying to save thesmelves, I doubt it.",

The decision to \u201ccancel\u201d a content producer, especially on the internet, I think is treated pretty lightly by either side. For the individual it can be a pretty challenging internal debate. So when I did decide to stop watching JonTron I did think about if I could go back to old videos and would it even make a difference but it came down to if I personally could appreciate something created by someone with just so much blas\u00e9 hate, and I just couldn\u2019t \n\n\nTLDR: JonTron\u2019s been here before, the choice to cut him out is genuinely difficult especially with online parasocial relationships.

            "Not JonTron but in the thread\n\n>There was a study or something like that done I think somewhere in Europe that theorized that CP that had been previously made could be used as part of treatment for pedophiles that would generally reduce the likelihood that they would actually go out and hurt a child. The idea requires consent of the victims in said videos or pictures. All he said was that if it was found to work and with consent of victims then that would probably be fine to him because in that case no new CP was being produced, consent was given and it was proved to ultimately reduce the amount of sexual violence against children.\n\nWtf this is so totally fucked up.  The idea of approaching people who were already victimized as children and asking them to allow their rape or molestation to be officially disseminated to the same kind of monsters that abused them is fully nauseating.  Especially because I remember seeing a post from a girl, I think it might have originally been in r/creepypms but it was crossposted some other subs, who had videos of her being abused still circulating that was messaged and harassed by guys who were viewing those videos saying they wanted to do horrible things to her or mocking her or one recognized her in public.  Wouldn't theoretical consenting adult victims with CP that had been made \"legal\" be more exposed to those same kind of gross messages made worse by the fact the pedos would stand on the idea they were okay with their abuse being consumed and giving pedos pleasure?   This is so much worse than the drawn CP debates or the ones about legal adult porn actors engaging in roleplay to provide \"therapeutic material\" to pedos.  At least in those situations children weren't hurt to make the stuff, but this plan would use real children and their real trauma.  Fucking gross.",

            "Broken was a typical person who loved to spend hours on a website. He was subbed to all the good subs and regularly posted and commented as well. He liked to answer questions, upvote good memes, and talk about various things that are relevant in his life. He enjoyed getting upvotes, comments, and gildings from his online friends. He felt like he was part of a big community and a website that cared about him for 10 years straight. \n\nBut Broken also had a problem. The website that had become part of his daily life had changed. Gradually, paid shills, bots and algorithms took over and continually looked for ways to make Broken angry, all so they could improve a thing called engagement. It became overrun by all the things that made other social media websites terrible. \n\nSadly, as the website became worse, Broken became isolated, anxious, and depressed. He felt like he had no purpose or direction in life. The algorithms and manipulation caused him to care far too much about his online persona and how others perceived him. Then one day the website decided to disable the one thing left that made it tolerable at all. \n\nThat day, Broken decided to do something drastic. He deleted all his posts and left a goodbye message. He said he was tired of living a fake life and being manipulated by a website he trusted. Instead of posing on that website, Broken decided to go try some other platforms that don't try to ruin the things that make them great. \n\nPeople who later stumbled upon Broken's comments and posts shocked and confused. They wondered why he would do such a thing and where he would go. They tried to contact him through other means, but he didn't reply. Broken had clearly left that website, for all hope was lost.\n\nThere is only but one more piece of wisdom that Broken wanted to impart on others before he left.

Thread ends up being an echo chamber for covid deniers and the rest of the [sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/hq910m/reopening_megathread_71320/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) is pissed.\n\n\nEdit: mods are now banning people that are posting in this thread from /r/WaltDisneyWorld. I have received messages from numerous people with proof confirming this. I got banned myself for creating this thread.\n\nEdit: a mod purged the entire thread and deleted almost every comment. Lots of users were banned and it seems like it was exclusively people that disagreed with the reopening. We also have people that got banned just for posting in here with no explanation from the mods. Not surprising considering [this](https://m.imgur.com/a/m89uDvC) is the mod doing the banning.\n\nEdit: if anyone sees this thread today - mods of /r/WaltDisneyWorld are now claiming myself and other users were banned because of hateful messages we sent to them through mod mail. This is a lie. I have screenshots to prove it and would love for them to provide evidence of this. The only message I sent them ever was asking why I was banned which got no response.

And it worked, too, our numbers went way down and we're now phasing into opening things back up.  Meanwhile, the rest of the country is still fucked because they never closed anything down.",

            "My experience with r/WaltDisneyWorld https://imgur.com/a/m89uDvC",
            "That comment where the mod doing most of the banning tried to say Disney should open if concerts, malls, sporting centers, and such can open made my head hurt.\n\n1: Most big gathering places should be closed right now, and if they aren't going to close they should take precautions like having limited entry, reminding guests to wear face masks, tsking temperatures before entry, and putting out things like hand sanitizer stations and in the case of bigger companies that can afford it maybe disposable mask and glove kiosks.\n\n2: Disney World isn't a small concert hall or a big shopping center, it's the largest collection if themd parks in the world with visitors coming in from almost every country. Not only is there likely to be more people at Disney World but there's also too much ground to cover, even for a company as large as Disney. There is no way they could ensure the safety of any guest, no matter what precautions they take the clientele is too large and too diverse in how they take care of themselves. If any top chart musician was to hold a concert today, there is no venue that would be a fraction of a fraction as dangerous as Disney World at any regular day given the current conditions.\n\n3: Even if you won't die from Covid-19, other people can, and if you were to put other people at risk because your risk factor is so low that's just selfish. People aren't afraid of Covid-19 just because a small but noticeable percentage of people have died so far from it, peopld are afraid of how contagious it is, with so many ways to spread and asymptomatic spreading this \"little\" virus has put all of humanity in a position it has never been in before. If you're not going to protect yourself, fine, but please have some empathy for the people around you and the people they will be around.\n\n4: Saying \"not many people have gotten sick\" is a blatant lie at this point, entire families are testing positive for Covid-19 and the number is rising almost exponentially. People saying \"Do your own research\" are a fucking joke, your days of Google searches, searches on a platform with an algorithm dedicated to finding out what confirmation biases they can get out of you for the sole purpose of keeping you invested in web pages longer so you can see ads ran through the same platform bringing you to the original page and in turn subtly implant the idea that you need to buy a product because you saw it when you felt a dopamine rush from seeing things you already agreed with, are a fucking joke. Wanna do your own research? Get away from Google, Yahoo, Bing, and whatever else is out there, find a few non-fiction books like journals and research anthologies by people who studied for years in the field of what you're looking into, get yourself a copy or find one either as an ebook out there in the internet, an audio book where someone reads it to you, or an actual book at a library or bookstore, and if you don't like the results from what professionals have said do your own actual, factual research by investing time into that field of study and performing actual tests yourself! And for fucks sake, anyone who says anything about \"big pharma\" can personally lick the genitals of internet trolls and shock value journalists who are making bank either in lulz or actual money off of your own insecurities! Sorry for getting heated and swearing, but meant everything I said, reply here if you want, I'll ignore DMs so don't use it to hide from other people in this thread who either took what I said on the cheek or are waiting for the shitshow to begin.\n\nAnd finally, 5: I am joining this subreddit, first time posting here and even seeing this sub and I know this is corny as fuck putting this kind of thing at the end but I honestly lost the ability to care for that. This entire drama around Covid-19 is just bubbling all my hatred for Anti-Vaxxers, MLMs, Cults, and Political Fanatics all at the same time. Covid-19 isn't a political issue, it's a biological issue, stop treating it like a bargaining chip and actually help yourself and everyone else by keeping yourself healthy and making sure other people stay healthy or stay away.",

Licenses for pump-action shotguns and semi automatic rifles and pistols are available to those who have a legitimate purpose for them and who are qualified. I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019d be willing to give up a few tacky, tryhard military-purpose weapons which poorly substitute accuracy, reliability and ease of maintenance for a higher fire rate and a few rails for you to clip your strobe lights and bayonets to while you play soldier, if it meant my own people across the country could be safe from that extra, much unneeded risk of tragedy at the hands of some pathetic cunt in need of a power trip. \n\nI see a lot of people pinning the blame on Australia for the shootings, which frankly is fucking ridiculous. The man who shot those people was born in Australia. That\u2019s all he can claim. He is not an Australian, and the fact that he had automatic weapons in New Zealand means New Zealand customs and security are at fault here. The man left a huge trail, communicating with his followers over social media, as well as 8chan, yet NZ anti terrorism failed to see/be notified of any of it. He live-streamed his killing for *17 minutes* on NZ social media before the stream was shut down. \n\nAlso, to extrapolate from your limited dealings with Australians on a social media platform to the conclusion that Australians are all racist is blatantly racist in itself, and ignorant. Yeah we have racists and extremists, but so does every country. It\u2019s like saying everyone in the south of the US is an unwashed, uneducated, racist confederate extremist. Also, the convict joke is throwing stones in a glass house. Let\u2019s not forget who\u2019s whip-streaked backs your country was built upon.",

Ignoring all the censorship and policy debate for a second, it seems like most of that thread have an encyclopedic knowledge of accidental death videos, snuff films, ISIS beheadings, and other brutal videos online which should leave any normal person shaken and scarred. The description of a scandinavian girl having her head sawed off while calling for her mom pretty much ruined my day without having to actually watch it. \n\nI can't even tell if this is political, most of the comments are from the\\_donald users, but isn't worldnews usually like that? What kind of person with at least an average amount of empathy would want to watch innocent people die? Which leads me to the conclusion that watchpeopledie had a heavy overlap with the alt-right as higher empathy, more sensitive individuals are usually liberal but I'm probably reading too far into this.",

            "I have no idea what is going on, but pretty sure the shooter wanted shit like this to happen .",
            "Just to play devil's advocate since all the comments here seem to be supporting the ban:\n\nI believe this is actually a power grab by our ISPs and they're using violent websites as a scapegoat to set precedent when it comes to having the right to control content that customers view.\n\nI think this issue closely overlaps the net neutrality debate that has been occurring in America for the past few years, and wouldn't be surprised if ISPs in Australia eventually start playing around with the idea of charging us for the right to access certain content (think \"entertainment\" packages for sites like youtube and netflix, \"social media\" packages for twitter and facebook, etc). \n\nI really don't like where this seems to be going.

If you haul big stuff 4 times a year it is cheaper to rent a trailer and tow it. Also station wagons use less fuel than SUVs and have more trunk space on average while often having 90% of the offroad capabilities which rarely makes a difference as both can drive on forest roads but both can't really offroad but that doesn't matter because statistically SUVs are not bought with the intent of being used to their U of utility. Most are just gas wasting idiots complaining abound really cheap gas not being cheap enough. Now if you drive an SUV and need it because you regularly haul some stuff on open fields with trailers than that is a good reason but some people just by shitty wasteful oversized cars, which is fine as long as they don't complain about gas when they conciously made the choice to use a lot more than necessary.

In each of the subreddits I have listed above, IRLOurPresident is the creator and head moderator. All other listed moderators on each of these subreddits appear to be \u2018empty\u2019 users. No comments, no posts. These mods exist only for show. IRLOurPresident is the controlling presence and has the ability to set and control a narrative.

Otherwise the top post would block the new post for an extra couple hours which limits how quickly and how high you can reach on /r/all. He's been doing this for years.

        "selftext": "**tl;dr: Fox News host Tucker Carlson claims that a source mailed him massively incriminating documents about Joe Biden's son that would totally sway the election for Trump, but unknown actors stole the only copies of the proof from his mail. Even the sub** r/Conservative **is skeptical about this story, with some saying it's evidence that spies are frantically suppressing the truth, or it's a Tucker ruse to force Biden to a misstep; others saying it's the most obvious \"my dog ate my homework\" in political history.**\n\n**UPDATE**: allegedly UPS found the missing package of \u201cevidence\u201d today, and Tucker [immediately announced that everyone should leave Hunter alone because Hunter is just a sad dude with drug problems.](https://www.thedailybeast.com/tucker-carlson-suddenly-says-its-time-to-leave-hunter-biden-alone)\n\nBackground: for anyone who hasn't been following the news, a week and some ago the New York Post broke the story that Hunter Biden, son of former VP and current presidential candidate Joe Biden, has been linked to serious crimes (at minimum corruption and bribery) by a laptop of his acquired under somewhat confused circumstances. Questions have emerged about the story, as supposedly it involves the California multi-millionaire Hunter dropping off several water-damaged Apple laptops at a tiny repair place at a strip mall in Delaware near Joe's home. The story is too complex to go into, but suspicious aspects include the shop owner is legally blind and can't guarantee it was indeed Hunter who dropped off the laptop, among other people he sent copies of the hard drive to Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, lots of odd twists. \n\nSo those who are skeptical allege that in actuality, hackers (possibly foreign) stole legit emails and photos from Hunter's iCloud for credibility and then mixed in fake incriminating materials and then loaded them onto a hard drive so as to have a plausible background story without admitting to the hacking. On the opposite end, those who believe it's real are convinced this is the \"nuclear bomb\" that destroys Joe Biden and wins the election for Trump, and the story on fringe media and discussion has rapidly expanded from the HD showing evidence of corruption and bribery (including kickbacks to Joe), photos/videos of Hunter with sex workers and using drugs (which nobody denies he's done in the past), and moved deeper and deeper into claims the HD shows Hunter molesting his underage niece, and allegations it shows Hunter *literally* cannibalizing Chinese children.\n\n**NOTE: do not do not do not link directly to any Hunter materials from Reddit, as at bare minimum they involve stolen personal intimate images, potentially show illegally-acquired hacked materials, and (probably not true but just to be safe) allegedly show crimes against minors. People linking to Hunter content from Reddit have been immediately and permanently banned, don't do it.**\n\nFor further context, just to address a common argument about Hunter (as neutrally as possible), while opponents say Hunter has received high paying jobs from foreign governments despite zero qualifications, to be fair he's a graduate of Yale Law School, was Executive VP at a US financial firm, worked on e-commerce programs at the US Department of Commerce, was appointed to the board of directors of Amtrak by President George W. Bush and became vice chairman, and has done a bunch of lobbying and investment activities. So it's totally fair to question the degree to which Hunter has leveraged his birth advantage, but it's also not like he was flipping burgers for crack money prior to this.\n\nOn to the popcorn: Fox News initially declined to cover the \"Hunter Biden bombshell\" or \"hard-drive from hell\" because Rudy Giuliani wasn't providing the metadata to confirm the contents are real. But some Fox News hosts *were* willing to report on the fact that the New York Post is talking about it. Tucker Carlson claims his sources in Washington DC obtained absolutely verifiable documents and mailed them to his Los Angeles office, and the package was intercepted and the documents removed. r/Conservative falls to debating how plausible this story is over a number of posts tonight:\n\n* [**I'm kind of upset at Tucker/Fox for sitting on this.** Since we know that they have copies, they must be published now!

No experience in the specific industry of the company you are being a director for is required, and it might even be undesirable.\n\nA board of.directors reviews the decisions of the officers of a company.  They are designed to be a sanity check on a company's operations.  They are supposed to review the company's actions and make sure that they are in the best interests of the company's shareholders.  They're a check against self dealing by the officers of the company.  If they can see areas where the company could be more efficient, or if the company is investing in a risky project, the board is supposed to stop it, or alert share holders.\n\nThe point of this is that the argument that Hunter Biden has no experience in the energy sector is totally irrelevant.  He graduated from Yale law, so I imagine that any company would want at least one qualified lawyer on their board.\n\nAs an example Hugh Johnston is the Chair for the audit committee on Microsoft's board of directors.

It shouldn't be treated as an opinion, because its actively hurting innocent people.  Being in one of these groups basically forces you to have to care about politics, because these \"policies\" decide whether or not you are safe and whether or not you can live your life.  Its different if someone is Republican and their ideologies are to keep production domestic and to allow more freedom with certain things like gun laws and stuff, but like, when it comes to my HUMAN FUCKING RIGHTS, that's when it's not okay.",
            "But nobody \"cancelled\" him. He did something a bunch of people didn't like and they said as much. That's it. Did some big publisher drop him? Did steam drop his games?

Millions of dollars in pocket, btw. \n\nAs usual what people claim is cancel culture is nothing more than consequences to a person's actions.

            "[This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/fivenightsatfreddys/comments/o1lfwo/scottgamescom_update/h226ned?context=4) brilliantly sums up my distaste for anyone bashing or blaming Twitter for \"cancel culture\".\n\nI swear, 2/3rds of people who decry \"cancel culture\" couldn't get the definition right, even if they looked it up in the dictionary.",
            "Wait, a dude that started out making low budget Christian games is a Conservative?\n\nCouldn't have seen it coming.\n\nThe plot thickens when you realise that one of the main causes for him developing the Five Nights at Freddy's series is because said games were heavily criticized, and then one of those critics later came out as trans. It's like a culture war bingo.\n\nEdit: Cleared up some confusing syntax.",
            "You'll take note to look at the post history of the people defending him...  Not ironic what other subreddits they post in.  (:",
            "the thing is, he claims to have received lots of support for the games from LGBTQ people, but he also donates to organizations that invalidates the existence and maybe even harms the lives of LGBTQ people",
            "So I feel like it needs to be stated that *Scott Cawthon was not doxxed* this entire controversy stemmed from when someone looked up his political donation history - and by law political donations *must* be publicly available information. So it isn't doxxing to note that he gave nearly fifty thousand dollars to republicans.\n\nNow, it's important to note that not all republicans are the same. Some are more hateful than others, which is why it's also vital to specify that he deliberately maxed out his donations to republicans who *explicitly* attempted to subvert the democratic process through a violent coup, are actively attempting to make being gay *illegal* through things like Anti-Sodomy Laws or otherwise simply get off on torturing LGBT+ children by openly supporting, promoting and encouraging anti-gay conversion camps while also attempting to reduce women's bodily autonomy and health care by making abortion illegal and reducing their access to things like birth control or basic care services like Planned Parenthood. Oh and then there's the anti-trans things which go beyond bathroom bills and into things like trying to make it so any attempt to give aid to a trans minor, almost never done through irreversible treatments like surgery mind you, will be a federal crime and making it so no one can afford or cover surgery and healthcare for trans related procedures and care. Oh, and there's the whole trans athletes thing. Despite the fact that trans athletes do not excel in sports, despite what reactionary media would have you say, republicans really, *really* want to instate policies that would let school staff enforce \"genital checks\" on students at will. So sure, give fifty thousand dollars to the weird, hateful, torture fucks that want to just openly molest students. Cool, dude. Real cool. But hey, he's pro-life. Loves them babies, really wants them to grow up so they can be molested so he can remove all funding and care that goes into the victims of that sexual abuse and punish them for being victims, as per the republican party line.",
            "Cancelling someone you like for a good reason is not \"cancel culture going too far\". If they did something fucked up like this, they don't deserve a platform. A lot of the fandom for his games is from the LGBTQ+ community so it makes zero sense to support and donate to someone who goes against the people who support him so much.",

            "I fucking hate this whole misappropriation. Being held accountable for your actions is not cancel culture. Nobody is stopping you from saying or believing something, but those words and beliefs don't exist in a vacuum.\n\nPeople can CHOOSE not to buy your product if they don't like who you associate with or what you support. Just like you can CHOOSE to say whatever racist, misogynistic, or other bigoted bullshit you want (or, you know, maybe choose not to?). And thanks to the fuckers people like this put in power, businesses count as people too, so they're free to withdraw their support also if your beliefs are unpopular or otherwise harmful to THEIR bottom line.\n\nThat choice is the very definition of freedom of expression. Freedom of choice is not freedom from consequences. That's not cancel culture. It's the actual free market you claim to hold above everything else, actually operating freely. It's not just what you want that matters, it's what everyone wants. Funny how it's only these people who scream cancel culture when they don't get their way, but when they're denying services to people or oppressing those they disagree with, THAT'S just the market at work.\n\nFucking hypocrites.",

            "Retiring as a response is just a PR move so he can play the victim. Nobody forced him to retire. He was slowly moving in that direction regardless. People called him out for having dumbfuck beliefs, so now he's doing what Republicans do, play the victim when they're called out for being terrible. He will probably make a lot of money talking about how he was canceled, woe is me,woe is me."
