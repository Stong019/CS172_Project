He probably clicked the np link back to the original thread from the SRD thread, switched over to normal participation reddit to say something in the original thread and got in trouble by a bot for it or something. They'll probably reverse the ban when they realize he was already part of the original thread.~~\n\n**EDIT: Apparently, it was for a whole different reason entirely.**\n\nFrom admin /u/cupcake1713: \"He was caught using a number of alternate accounts to downvote people he was arguing with, upvote his own submissions and comments, and downvote submissions made around the same time he posted his own so that he got even more of an artificial popularity boost.

It was a really stupid move on my part, and I feel pretty bad about it, especially because it's entirely unnecessary.\nCompletely understandable catch on the side of the admins, so good work for them!

            "Wow I cannot believe this. Still, I put a lot of work into Unidan's obituary and I am glad to be able to post it. Sucks for him, I guess! But awesome for me.\n\nAhem.\n\nBiologist, scientist, ab model, and super user /u/Unidan was shadowbanned today, after ~~losing a battle concerning whether or not a bird is a jackdaw or a crow~~ breaking all of our hearts and using alt accounts to upvote himself like a jabroni. How dare u. HOW DARE U. His account was 4 years old.\n\nWhen speaking about /u/Unidan, it is impossible to separate the man from the mythology that has surrounded him. I am referring, of course, to Unidan's extensive -- almost terrifyingly extensive -- sexual history. Don Juan, Wilt Chamberlain, Gheghis Khan, all well known for having a tremendous amount of sexual partners, may as well be considered virgins, as they all fall well short of Unidan's voracious sexual appetite. His tireless, almost unceasing efforts to bed as many women (and men) as are possible under the physical and mathematical constraints of the universe as we know it are well known. What is not well known is the exact number of people with whom Unidan has had sexual contact. It is believed by scientists and macro-statisticians to be well over 100,000, perhaps as many as half a million.\n\nPart of the reason why it's so difficult to deduce an exact number is that most of the people with whom Unidan has slept are still recovering from exhaustion and the inability to speak after such an incredible amount of sexual pleasure, and thus cannot add to the data collected by unidanologists. This has been termed by doctors as \"Unidan sexual pleasure coma\" and has been compared to over dosing on heroin, methamphetamine, and kitten snuggles all at once. Certainly an incredibly serious medical condition. But worth it. My God is it ever worth it.\n\nIt is this legacy - as well as countless legions of legitimate and illegitimate children - that /u/Unidan will undoubtedly leave behind in the wake of his untimely shadowban. Fare thee well, Unidan, may the orgy pits of heaven be always greased and full of buxom, willing partners, and may ye recover quickly from the indelible sexual conquests found there.\n\nEdit: to reflect the true circumstances of Unidans shadowban. Yanno, they say it's better to have loved and lost but from where I'm sitting it's really hard to see that. ",
            "*Jackdaws gather, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my ban. I shall take no gold, mod no subs, father no child comments. I shall wear no flairs and win no glory.

The (now-ex) moderator did allege support from other parts of the mod team, as well as claim to be in contact with the admins [\\(5\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/simpsonsshitposting/comments/rahjdi/update_after_conversation_with_admins_i_may/) [\\(6\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/simpsonsshitposting/comments/rah6xq/an_illegitimate_coup_is_taking_place/) [\\(6r\\)](https://www.reveddit.com/v/simpsonsshitposting/comments/rah6xq/an_illegitimate_coup_is_taking_place/), so what's happening behind the scenes still seems a little muddy.

While it is possible the ex-mod is lying, it should be noted that have always been very open about their fascist sympathies, and were still let on the team, so another moderator(s) sympathising or wanting them to torch the sub isn't a huge stretch. On a final note though, the subreddit has been getting some very nice anti-Mussolini memes, which is a fine silver lining\n\nBonus: [Ex-mod comes into this thread demanding its removal](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/radkz4/moderator_in_rsimpsonsshitposting_comes_out_as_a/hnio4io/) [\\(r\\)](https://www.reveddit.com/v/SubredditDrama/comments/radkz4/moderator_in_rsimpsonsshitposting_comes_out_as_a/hnio4io/?ps_after=1638830206%2C1638833339&context=0), states it was the admins, not other mods who removed them\n\nFinal edit: Both the ex-mod and moderator who invited them have been removed from the /r/simpsonsshitposting team now, along with the entire mod team, with the [admins removing all mods and restricting submissions](https://www.reddit.com/r/simpsonsshitposting/comments/raoawy/submissions_are_restricted/).

            "I post this breakdown whenever anti-Asian racism comes up, so here it is again. Also, thanks OP for being on top of this story.\n\n\\-----\n\nOrientalism is not a specific set of racist stereotypes, but rather a distinct system of racism. For complicated reasons involving economic and geopolitical factors at the time, European exercise of imperialist power in Asia was a bit different than elsewhere in the world. While of course this happened to some extent everywhere, European ingress into Asia required more negotiation with and participation with the native social and cultural systems, as opposed to outright conquering and imposition. They got around to conquering and imposition in the long run, but they did so in a way which forced them to engage directly in a highly complex millennia-old culture. This naturally created some cognitive dissonance: how do you justify rule over someone else on the basis of their inferiority, when everyday you're being forced to confront the complexity of their culture? The answer was Orientalism, or the theory that 'civilization' could be split into two types, the intellectual, rational West, and the mystic, unchanging East.\n\nThis is significant, because it produces a fundamentally distinct system of racism. Racism against African and Indigenous American people is often grounded on the (fallacious) premise that they are barbarous, and do not have true civilization. Racism against Asians is typically grounded on a different premise, that they have civilization, but that it is mystic civilization. It's not that cut-and-dry, of coarse. For example, you definitely see Orientalism at play against cultures like the Aztecs, and there are certainly tropes of barbarity employed against Asians sometimes. But broadly speaking, an observable distinction exists. This can often foster problems in modern antiracist activism, because our perceptions of racism are grounded in studying the history of the development of racism against people of African and Indigenous American origin. So for example, antiracist activists will observe attitudes towards Asians along the lines of, \"look how civilized they are,\" and come to the conclusion that actually racism against Asians isn't so bad. But that fails to take into account that most atrocities against Asian people have specifically been justified on the premises that Asians embody a 'dangerous' mystic civilization.\n\nOrientalism views Asian culture as unchanging and monolithic. This is the other side of the coin to the perceived mysticism of Asian culture, which is meant to differentiate it from the perceived rationalism of western culture. 'Mysticism' also decontextualizes Asian culture from its context. The West is seen as rational, therefore the things that happen in the West are explicable by studying them in nuance. But the East is seen as mystical, meaning that things just sorta happen there (this is if you're looking through the racist lens of Orientalism). Meaning that the East supposedly can be explained simply through observation of what happens there. The East becomes responsive not to its own history, but to the context of the Western gaze. Thus, the East becomes monolithic, because it functions largely as a proxy for the West to enact its own ideas about itself.\n\nThis monolithic nature to Orientalism comes to play quite often in western discourse. The East becomes either a monolith of the abuse of power, or a monolith of victimhood at the feet of the West. But what the East can never be, at least in the context of Orientalism, is the product of complex historical and cultural systems which incorporate imperialism both internal and external, systems of power both internal and external, and both internalization of globalized western culture as well as continuity of existing indigenous culture.\n\nThat can sound difficult to navigate. But the thing is, it really shouldn't be nearly as intimidating as it sounds. We view Western culture in its full complexity *all the time*. Answer this: *My computer monitor is a square, all squares have four sides, how many sides does my computer monitor have?* If you answered four, you just used a syllogism. Syllogistic logic was first detailed in a formal fashion by Aristotle, who also had some interesting thoughts concerning the Athenian polity, an institution involving slavery and deep misogynies. That doesn't inhibit our ability to apply syllogistic logic, and the idea that we can't distinguish the two things probably seems absurd. *This is the Orientalist bias at play*. Years of history has programmed us to default into *distinguishing* elements of \"Western\" culture while *homogenizing* elements of \"Eastern\" culture. The rational West set against the mystic East.\n\nAnd syllogistic logic isn\u2019t actually as universal as you might think it is. There are other equally significant models of formal logic. For example, dharmic philosophy standardized its first models of formal logic around the same time as the Greeks did. They then went on to solve many of the same basic logic problems as the Greeks, and at roughly the same pace. Here\u2019s the catch. Both schools got the same answers *despite* the fact that they work in fundamentally different fashions. Greek formal logic is based on syllogistic logic, formalizing the meaning of an expression. In syllogism, the answer given by solving the expression will always be correct, but expressions are limited in the kind of problems they can solve. Dharmic formal logic is based on technical logic, formalizing the organization of an expression. That's kinda like ignoring whether a sentence makes sense in favor of whether it\u2019s grammatically correct. Technical logics require you to accept prima facie that no correct answer is guaranteed, but that the process of answering will yield information, if not a valid solution. Less reliable, but vastly more flexible.\n\nIt\u2019s incredibly cool that something as \u2018common sense\u2019 as syllogism turns out to actually not be as common sense as you might think. And that matters historically. Algebra, one of the foundational concepts in all modern mathematics, was essentially formed out of the merger of Greek algorithmic logic with Sanskrit formal grammars under the rule-based organizational framework of Islamic jurisprudence. Algorithmic logic descends from syllogistic logic. Sanskrit grammar is intertwined with theories of technical logic. As for Islamic jurisprudence, that\u2019s a deeply complex cultural tradition in its own right. It\u2019s a tragedy of Orientalism that only \u2153 of the perspectives which went into creating Algebra goes appreciated. Everyone likes to bring up Arabic and Indian contributions to mathematics as an antiracist \u201cfun fact\u201d, but reducing the full breadth of Nyaya technical logic and Arabic jurisprudence to a small piece of trivia is actually only replicating the underlying racist bias of Orientalism. Now consider what it would be like if these elements of culture weren\u2019t just bits of trivia, but the way you see and interact with the world. Perceptions of Asians can often feel like an existential threat to those of us who are simply attempted to live as we have always lived, and be seen as real. It's not about credit. It's about being made to feel like aliens for the things which are as intuitive to us as: *if a then b, and if b then c, then if a then c*.\n\nPeople often feel overwhelmed when faced with the complexity and nuance of different types of racism. That's *totally* understandable and it's a very natural. But it's also a function of how racism against Asia operates. Because the complexity in question applies to pretty much all cultures. And yet it tends not to trigger the same sort of dread in conjunction with \"Western\" culture, or forms of racism that are more immediate to the West, as it does for the \"East\". This is a really deeply situated bias, and I'm not ascribing it to any single person *personally*. In fact, even among Asian people there's still internalized Orientalism. It really is inescapable. But I think that identifying and confronting it can help to challenge that fear of facing a complex world, and lead to better, more informed stances in the long-run.\n\nMy cultural background is in the Sahaja tradition, and in my family, I'm the only person of my generation who is trained in the tradition. Of the older generations, there are only three people left, and they're getting quite old. By the end of this decade, it's likely that I'll be the last of us. This despite young people in my family being proud of their identity, and my family putting emphasis on protecting our heritage. Why is it fading? Because of the crushing pressure that gets put on us to assimilate and conform, a pressure that I think goes unrecognized. As Asians, it might seem like we're treated better, but the moment we embody complexity or nuance, the hammer really comes down. I'm not trying to establish a competition between myself and those of other identities. This stuff is contextual. I genuinely don't think that it can be compared. But I also think people need to appreciate that violence against Asian people is way more normalized than they realize. It goes unnoticed because it's more polite and therefore invisible. But we're talking about the eradication of entire cultures here. That's plain old violence, and it takes a mental toll. If antiracism can't see ethnic cleansing for what it is, how can it call itself antiracist?",

First off... vote bots and the actual people just blindly upvoting everything help explain the upvotes, which isn't even getting into the fact that upvoting a post =/= being supportive of LGBT rights. \n\nSecond off... 90%? lol get fucking real. Maybe that many might *tolerate* it (which I also doubt), but it's delusional to think there were that many people actually supportive of LGBT rights on r/t_d.

            "On an tangential geologic note:\n\n500 million years ago and prior (the Proterozoic), rivers were, by and large, [braided](https://i.imgur.com/Vg3EAaZ.jpg). This was because the continents were not colonized by any forms of life, particularly plant life. Without plants, the runoff from storms would choke rivers with so much sediment that they would result in the above braided form. It is only after plants began to colonize the continents that braided river forms became the exception to the rule. Braided rivers, like the one linked above, can still be found in places where the plantlife is unable to counter the effects of large runoff - particularly in the tundra.\n\nBack to your regularly scheduled drama.",
            "The continuation of skepticismm regarding 9/11 is a failure of basic science education / understanding. \n\n1) As weird as it is to think about, skyscrapers are designed so that one floor (with the exception of the central support beams) support only the floor directly above it.\n\n2) Every building element has a fire rating. A period where the material burns, while maintaining structural stability. Steel beams do not have to melt to lose structural strength. They can weaken due to fire. No melting required.\n\n3) Jet fuel was not the only fuel. There were cubicles. Paper. Walls. Even the \"fireproofing\" material will burn given enough temperature. \n\n4) skyscrapers are designed to collapse in on their own footprint.\n\n",

            "Except buildings are mostly hollow, and have a great deal of mass that is perfectly balanced and engineered specifically to keep itself vertical against wind and earthquakes. Also, a great deal of inertia which comes with such great mass, which the \"new physics lad\" is not comprehending.\n\nAnother note: on a small scale things like steal and concrete have a higher strength to mass ratio. So the relatively small weight of a smaller structure is less compared to the strength of the materials building it.\n\nMassive skyscrapers however are an absolute feat of engineering to overcome the limitations of the materials themselves. And it all relies heavily on all parts sharing load in specific ways.  \n\nOnce a section large enough is weakened enough to completely fail, the entire structure is in jeopardy. it'll cause one floor to begin falling onto the one below, especially with so many floors above the impact site straining the weakened section. One it starts collapsing it's done. It's not going to stop, the forces are too great. And on it goes, causing it to fall mostly straight down, **Exactly because** of the weight. There is not enough resistance below it to cause 10s of 1000s of tonnes to divert course, air be damned. ",

            "I actually learned this in my stormwater management and design course in undergrad for my Civil/Environmental Engineering degree. However it has been a couple of years so I am paraphrasing and only referring to papers written by the author leopold I can find online. I remember having a HW questions regarding river meandering and I couldn't just use google for the \"correct\" fluvial/river morphology answer my professor was looking for, unless I looked the author specifically (Quoting my professor: \"streambed instability is an acceptable answer from 2nd graders, give me a future engineer/post-grad answer\"). BTW the author Leopold (Founding father of river morphology), who's novella (I forget the name but Leopold was one of the authors) is an excellent read if you're into river morphology. The things discussed in the book is not common knowledge that can be easily found on google.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nELI5 ANSWER TO RIVER MEANDERING\n\nThe EILI5/google explanation for why rivers meander is due to streambed instability.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIN DEPTH RIVER MORPHOLOGY/FLUVIAL PROCESS/STREAM DYNAMIC ANSWER TO WHY RIVERS MEANDER\n\nThe more in depth fluvial process explanation (and it has been a few years so don't quote me), is due to the fact rivers have a tendency to acheive two states simultaneously. They have a tendency to assume forms that minimize expenditure of energy, as well have a tendency to assume forms that make energy expenditure uniform. IIRC, my professor said that these two states cannot be acheived simultaneously even though the river will try to assume both forms, therefore it causes the river to meander. From Leopold 1964, \"for a river to maintain uniform expenditure of energy along a river it would result in a nearly straight, moderately concave longitudinal profile\". Whereas (IIRC from class), to minimize expenditure of energy, it would take the path of least resistance, which may or may not be a straight path. Therefore, by attempting to assume both forms simultaneously (which is impossible), the energy expenditure causes the river to meander.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I'm out of work I can review my notes and re-read sections of the book to confirm everything I just said. So take the above with a \"grain of salt\" until next edit.",

On average, a person preoccupied with money problems exhibited a drop in cognitive function similar to a 13-point dip in IQ, or the loss of an entire night\u2019s sleep.\n\n>But when their concerns were benign, low-income individuals performed competently, at a similar level to people who were well off, said corresponding author Jiaying Zhao, who conducted the study as a doctoral student in the lab of co-author Eldar Shafir, Princeton\u2019s William Stewart Tod Professor of Psychology and Public Affairs. Zhao and Shafir worked with Anandi Mani, an associate professor of economics at the University of Warwick in Britain, and Sendhil Mullainathan, a Harvard University economics professor.\n\n>\u201cThese pressures create a salient concern in the mind and draw mental resources to the problem itself.

Yes, a self-reporting questionnaire or similar tool could be used to capture these data, but ultimately it would be viewed as subjective data not substantive enough to withstand the rigor of the scientific method. That is why surrogate endpoints are often used. In oncology clinical trials the gold standard endpoint is overall survival or how long did the intervention extend the life of a patient. However bc of the many problems with capturing OS (time, money, loss to follow-up, other interventions during or after a trial, etc) researchers often use surrogate endpoints such as tumor response or progression-free survival, etc. In this case, being a minority is a surrogate endpoint for \u201cexperiences racism\u201d.

            "Not an expert on the topic, but what about minorities that live semi homogeneous communities? Like a Muslim in Dearborn vs a Muslim in rural Ohio or possibly an Asian in Chinatown vs an Asian in Omaha? Is it the general stress of being a minority in an area dominated by a different race? What could solve this? Enforced diversity in different areas? Segregation? And on being poor, is it all poor people, or is it better for poor people with support structures? Is the poor caused by stress or the stress caused by poor? Really interested in this topic.",

Whenever you tried to find good and honest information on games the articles were trying to find the good things in the games and called dog shit trash \"suboptimal\" or \"not as good as the previous ones\" or \"an *okay* game\". So people never knew what to actually buy and spend time on playing. I'm all for changing the tone in journalism. You don't have to directly insult people but if someone says something stupid say that what they said was stupid. If someone is being an asshole tell them that they're acting like an insensitive asshole. If something is bad call it bad.\n\nThis expectation for people to always be nice and civil just poisoned any sort of honest discourse and feedback. Getting loud or cussing does not mean that \"you lost the discussion\". And if there's nothing positive to say you shouldn't say nothing, you should still say that it's bad.

The current voting system has people voting out of fear against the candidates they hate, rather than for candidates they really like and agree with...Democracy is not a question of who do we hate the most.\n\nThis is actually I've been wanting to see, and seeing *anybody* talk about it excites me. This is well said; I wonder what other thoughts she has on the topic\n\n> It is on the ballot as a referendum in the state of Maine for use in statewide elections. \n\nI had no idea! How exciting! Instant runoff in the US is a real possibility, now \n\n>The Democrats refused to let the bill out of committee - and they continued to do that every time the bill was refiled. Why is that? It's because they are taking marching orders from the big banks and fossil fuel giants and war profiteers. \n\nOf course, the fossil fuel giants and war profiteers are subordinate to the lizard people who live in the Earth's mantle, and they are often at odds with the Illuminati, who support a more progressive climate agenda but want to deregulate the financial sector.

They are inept and stupid but they can still feel bad about that.\n\nTo play a little devil's advocate here - OP's Covid stats are whack, but it does seem a lot safer to have a get-together with coworkers who you spend a lot of time with day-to-day than to visit extended family, especially those who were commenting that they travel 4-5 different places during Christmas to catch all the family visits. That was the whole concept of 'social pods.'\n\nAlso, many were saying how weird it was for OP to throw a party for their coworkers, like no one wants to hang out with their coworkers after work unless it was an obligated get-together. Just because that is true for you, doesn't mean it is for everyone. I've worked places where coworkers had a separate party together other than the work-sponsored one because we liked spending time together. It is just a culture and people thing.\n\nJust because OP is wrong, doesn't mean your presumptions are true. All the people yelling at OP and calling them an asshole over something that was dumb and frankly not that big of a deal is a little ironic.",

What you're referring to as pedophilia, is in fact, ephebophilia/pedophilia, or as I've recently taken to calling it, ephebdophilia plus pedophilia. Pedophilia is not a paraphilia unto itself, but rather another base and immoral perversion of a fully functioning child molestation system made useful by the ephembephilia justifications, equivocation systems and vital rationalization components comprising a full mental illness as defined by the DSM-V. Many child abusers run a modified version of the pedophilia system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of ephedrinephilia which is widely used today is often called \"pedophilia\", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the pederast system, developed by the Kiddy Diddler Project. There really is a pedophilia, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Pedophilia is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other perversions that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an unethical ideology, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a completely degenerate mentality. Pedophilia is normally used in combination with the hebephebelebephilia operating system: the whole system is basically pedophilia with ephebephilia added, or pedophilia/ephebephilia. All the so-called \"pedophilia\" distributions are really distributions of ephebephilia/pedophilia.\n\nI\u2019m posting this again as it was made at great cost. CCW!",
            "This reminds me a lot of the whole Hans Reiser thing.\n\nFor those who don't know, Hans Reiser was a Linux programmer/businessman who developed what was at the time a popular file system for Linux.  He killed his Russian mail order bride wife (and mother of his children) and didn't do a great job of covering it up.  It was *so obvious* he was guilty -- there just wasn't any other plausible explanation of the evidence.\n\nBut the Linux community was largely convinced he was innocent, and that he had been framed, and that the cops just thought he looked guilty because he was kind of a weird dude like they were kind of weird dudes.\n\nIt was that day that I realized that programming nerds had our own O.J. Simpson.  They swore he was innocent until the day Reiser cut a deal and led the police to where he hid his wife's body.\n\n(Aside:  Reiser, of course, testified in his own defense and tried to explain away all the evidence as though the jury would be stupid to believe it.  He wasn't as good of a salesman as he thought he was.)",

People are saying Stallman did all kinds of nasty shit like coercing colleagues into have sex with him, but I haven't seen any proof of that, which, of course, might as well not exist at all regardless of the veracity of the claim.

And if you're going to counter someones point but you're criticizing the way they structure their argument as opposed to their actual argument on the internet, on a jennifer lawrence subreddit.... it makes you look a bit douchey.

You know, did they have a good support system in place to help them navigate it, or were they thrown to the dogs and suffer inordinately for it and form defensive mechanisms as a result?\n\nThe latter often results in trauma and some deeply unhealthy behaviors which doesn't present \"strength,\" in many way these sorts of walls make us weaker and more susceptible to future failure because we become unable to be vulnerable enough to cope well.\n\nCase in point: A lot of these dudes do not cope well. They're not stronger for it. They're just more defensive - and that sort of defensiveness even animals recognize as weakness. Strong characters are confident and secure, they don't need to ask themselves how they'll exert their power because they don't feel powerless.\n\nThere's a reason the top comments are examples of people trying to point out the absurd weaknesses of others and demeaning them for it - it's a way to elevate yourself by putting down others.\n\nCourse I'm sort of doing the same - but I guess the difference is I don't blame them. We're in a shit situation and helplessness is so common a feeling and I don't blame people at all for not having developed good methods of coping - we're not taught that shit.\n\nBut it ain't making us stronger.",

An example would be our capitalist world view or the ideal of strife and success being two sides of the same coin.\n\nReally though, the only thing that makes cultures more powerful or more successful is access to resources. The more access you have, the easier it is to become stronger. A combination of access to iron, the ability and need to build powerful navies, and theft of knowledge due to things like the crusades are really what has made the West so powerful over the ages, which has nothing to do with our cultural ideologies... not to mention how we could have acquired that knowledge peacefully if we just communicated with the Muslim groups in Jerusalem rather than destroying everything.

Rampant abuse of children because daddy is drunk and mummy has her own form of PTSD from dealing with daddy. Entire families falling apart. \n\nNowadays we have medication, counselling, and (where needed) in-patient treatment. We can't help everyone because of budget cuts and a continuing stigma of mental health treatment but damnit we are *trying*. And then you get knuckle-draggers like these chucklefucks who wander around going hurrr durr durrrrrr kids these days don't know they're born duuurrrrrr like the point of society is for everything to get progressively worse instead of better.\n\nMy dad would have killed himself had he not met my mum and had she not gotten him to a doctor when he had the first of many breakdowns.

            "I\u2019ve thought a bit about this. It\u2019s fantastic that we shed light on mental illness these days; I remember when it was more of a stigma. Things have changed significantly just in the ten years I\u2019ve been working in the mental health field. It\u2019s not the professional side of society that\u2019s been going off in the wrong direction; in general that side has been progressively more supportive and caring about mental illnesses. \n\nBut there really does seem to be a sort of popular embrace of mental illness and weakness that, I think, is counterproductive. Well, at least if the Internet is any evidence. It seems like people are looking at mental illness as a community or in-group, and taking it as a positive thing. (I hesitate to use the word positive, but I can\u2019t think of a better one.) It\u2019s similar to the way some parts of the deaf community insist that deafness is not a disability, but rather is a part of their identity and shouldn\u2019t be cured even if it\u2019s possible to do so. I probably risk attracting flack for saying do, but I think that\u2019s a bad perspective; I\u2019m all for community (especially when a group has been abused in the past, like the deaf have sometimes been). We ought to heal where we can. And that\u2019s the thing about mental illness; sure, we can\u2019t cure it, but...shouldn\u2019t we *try* to make it better? There\u2019s a segment of the Internet that doesn\u2019t seem to agree, and is actively against the idea of self-improvement. That\u2019s very unfortunate. If you live with depression, anxiety, ADHD, bipolar, etc., why *wouldn\u2019t* you want to feel better, function better, etc.?",

            "The irony is always rooted in their ignorance. At least, you hope that that many people aren\u2019t bots or willful puppets.\n\nIt is simple. Russian leaders started calling Ukrainians fascists to push back against Ukraine\u2019s desire to strengthen economic ties to the rest of Europe. Putin\u2019s regime finds this closer relationship between Ukraine and NATO countries threatening because it considers NATO a threat to Russia\u2019s modern imperial ambitions. Far-right Russian militant nationalism (which is at least fascism adjacent) is how Putin consolidated power. That far-right ideology depends on rebuilding Russia\u2019s imperial identity. \n\nRussian leaders continued this narrative to justify its initial invasion to secure Crimea after Ukrainians ousted Russia\u2019s client president. Russian policymakers increase this propaganda anytime it seeks to initiate aggressive warfare against its neighbors to support the necessary narrative to convince the Russian people that war is justified. Russians are sufficiently interested in Putin\u2019s imperial strategy. Russians are also automatically hostile to anything that resembles territorial ambition because of the legacy of WWII. \n\nThe Putin regime has worked for decades to associate itself with the Soviet Union and to exploit the narratives that are important to Russian identity. This might be why so many ignorant leftists are fooled into supporting Russian propaganda. One of those narratives is the horrific tragedy of WWII committed specifically against the Soviets and Slavic peoples by Nazi Germany. Ever since, Moscow, in whatever form with whatever ideology, has cried fascist to justify its own expansionists ambitions. Putin, like the Soviet leaders before him, exploit this historic trauma to cover up his own misdeeds. \n\nIronically, the leftist who claim to be anti-war only help to promote war by forwarding the narrative that Ukrainians are fascists. This narrative exists exclusively to support Russia\u2019s war effort.\n\n[A lot of nations who experienced the horror of WWII that were in or enveloped by the Soviet Union have big problems with neonazism including Russia. They simply never dealt with their own issues with antisemitism after the Holocaust. Jews continued to experience special persecution in the Soviet Union. The Soviets didn\u2019t allow any analysis of its own complicity in WWII. Putin has worked hard to reverse Russian attempts to grapple with this complex issue. Leading parties across East and Central Europe have tried to downplay or erase their own complicity on the Holocaust. The problem is complex and diffuse].",

I also told him I saw him as a dad, and he always used to say how intelligent and mature I was, and was also very liberal with hugs when I needed comfort. See the red flags? Well, I didn't. \n\nHe kept pursuing me even after I had graduated and was in a happy relationship, going as far as kissing me, then grabbing my chin and kissing me again when I turned my head away from him. I guess I was too blind to see how fucked up this is. He also had phases where he was extremely emotionally distant, not replying to texts, and then again phases where he'd squeeze me to death and tell me how much he loved me. \n\nAll the while, I wasn't interested in a romantic or sexual relationship at all, and just wanted a father-like figure to talk to, so I didn't cut ties for a LONG time. He definitely used my vulnerability for his own pleasure, and honestly, it still kind of fucks me up five years later.\n\nSo honestly, when you're in this kind of toxic relationship, you don't even realize how shitty the other person actually is to you, and how creepy this behavior is.

Reddit edgelords were already hating on Captain Marvel before Avengers: Endgame. They didn't like the 'female empowerment' vibe from the first trailers for her own movie and it all continued from there.\n\nAlso, since when do people hate on male actors simply because their character isn't compelling in the MCU? The first Thor and Captain America flicks were pretty pedestrian compared to the films that followed it. I don't recall people irrationally hating on Chris Hemsworth as a result. Captain Marvel was actually pretty good for a first intro by MCU standards. Better than Black Panther or Guardians of the Galaxy? No. Better than Captain America: The First Avenger? Absolutely.

            "Brie Larson, always bifurcating people.",
            "I gave a talk recently at an event with a lot of judges (I\u2019m not one), and afterwards passed along a hello to my wife from an old friend of hers who was there, but who had no connection to the legal system. My wife asked why her friend was there, and I explained it was an event giving judges a chance to meet leaders in the local Black community. \u201cThen why were *you* there?\u201d, my wife asked. My daughter immediately piped up \u201cHe\u2019s a sixty year old white male! He\u2019s entitled to be wherever he wants!\u201d\n\nMy daughter was joking. Apparently some people genuinely think everything really *does* have to be for my demographic.",
            "There\u2019s like only 3 good MCU movies.",
            "> For example, her comments on Captain Marvel being able to lift Thor's hammer were not taken lightly by the fans. Thor himself had to go through character development to become worthy of the hammer. It took many years and many movies for us to see Cap, one of the original heroes, lift the hammer. Saying a character that has yet to prove herself in the universe could lift the hammer made her seem not serious about the movie universe and she only cared about making her own character a powerful feminist.\n\nOk, this is bull.\n\nCaptian America, IMO, has no character development in at least the first 4 movies he appears in. Possibly in all the movies he appears in. From the very start of The First Avenger, he is shown to be an upstanding guy. That never changes in any of the films. The closest he comes to character development is being the catalyst for change in other characters, like bucky in the winter soldier. \n\nI'm not saying by any means that it's inherently a bad thing and if you disagree that fine. I'm willing to change my mind on this. But this redditor predicating their dislike of Brie Larson on Captain America's character development feels disingenuous. \n\nSecond, I think the reason Thor has had such major and such obvious character development is at least partially because part of his shtick is that his hammer requires that he is \"worthy\". Separately, I'd also say Mjolnir makes the development quantifiable, which helps the development he has really stand out to the audience. \n\nTo get to the point of the matter: Did Captain Marvel have NO character development in her solo film like this commentor suggests? No. Throughout her movie, she serves as a protector of a group people, in the same way any armed service member is. She starts out with the Kree fighting against the Skrull because she is kept ignorant of the Kree's real motivations. She's plucked out of her normal environment, exposed to the Skrull's POV, and finally seeing the situation from both angles, decides to fight WITH the Skrulls against the Kree. It's a complete 180\u00b0 turn. \n\n(Hmm, could the fact that such a powerful military-associated figure chooses to help refugees instead of the governing instituion that continues to harm them have something to do with why some people don't like the movie or character? The world may never know. /s)\n\nIf you don't like calling that character development, you could even say instead that her character is revealed in the film- not unlike Iron Man in his first film when he is removed from his life of insulated luxury and thrust into an environment where his weapons have caused destruction. There is definitely a parallel there between Iron Man and Captain Marvel origin stories. And yet it's only a problem for the latter and not the former. \n\nI think the real answer to the OP's question is that Brie made a comment before the release of Captain Marvel where she said that the audience for their movie wasn't men and that more seats should be added to \"the table\" - aka that women and minority voices need to be included more and listened to. The hate train has been running ever since. The other reasons redditors listed in the thread are part of it, but if people hadn't made up their mind that they hated Brie in March 2019, then no one would have cared about her body language in that interview with Cheadle and Hemsworth. It wouldn't have mattered as much that she suggested her character could lift Mjolnir.",
            "Losers with irrational hate for actresses are the worst type of losers.",
            "It's easy to see why there's so much hate for Brie Larson. She played the most realistic liberal character in anything Dan Harmon's done. The rabid 'Rick and Morty Purist' fuckwits are exposed to her in that context and they can't separate character from actor so they're on the hunt for sociological 'evidence' the second her name is mentioned.\n\nEDIT: wait am I thinking of someone else",
            "I get it I didnt like Captain Marvel either. Brie Larson hate is greatly exaggerated",
            "What I find weird is that astrosharma guy stanning/white knighting for white people. Dudes fuckin Indian, born and raised lol. \n\nAlso funny how the idea of context is completely lost on these people. Yes replacing a word changes it\u2019s meaning, but it wouldn\u2019t make sense since the context and history of film critics wouldn\u2019t line up with the criticism. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t wanna hear was some 40 year old Blackman has to think about [movie outside his demographic]\u201d doesn\u2019t make sense. What profession only gave black men the legitimate, prestigious culture influencers/critics for decades, and even after desegregation still hold a majority in that profession? I can\u2019t think of one honestly. If there is one then we can compare apples to apples. But as it stands these brainlets don\u2019t understand how the quote critics what has been more or less the status quo for decades.",

            "I like how he says Wonder Woman was great,  and Capt Marvel sucked..... yet the later clearly made ~$350 million more money.   And Black Widow, which he  also cites.... hasn't even been released and we have no idea how it will perform yet.    if that's how he defines people hating a movie, then he's crazy... anyone who wants to hate me and in return force me to take $1.2 billion dollars from them, I'm just saying I'm here and willing to accept the payment right now.   However, if you don't give me the $1.2 billion, then you aren't allowed to hate me.  And I'm happy to sue your ass if you if you try and hate with out paying me first.  \n\nHeck, this week only, I'll let you hate me for a one time payment of just $1.0 billion!   Think of it, you'll be saving a cool $200 million in hate expenses.   Don't miss out on this wonderful deal! \n\nSome terms and conditions may apply. Offer void in the state of Tennessee.",

            "Time to chuckle at the remnants of r/braincels trying to stroke their oversized ego. It's as if they don't understand what dating is, so they just act like an asshole to the nearest woman and \"ask\" themselves, \"Why can't I get a girlfriend?\" The answer is always that they're acting like a misogynistic asshole, and nobody wants to be married to a misogynistic asshole. But alas, they never seem to consider that their own behavior is the reason why nobody wants to be their girlfriend.",
            "Always find it funny when die-hard fans who also happen to be misogynists suddenly hate the writing for a franchise which has always been poorly written. There\u2019s bad writing all throughout the marvel franchise yet suddenly when people can blame it on \u2018representation\u2019 they start to notice it.

Which is entirely understandable. \n\nBearing in mind people seem to forget many actors and actresses have done much worse things and they still watch their movies. Just a case of her just not seeming to be very likeable in person and a comment that IMO shouldn't have been said.",

I get it. She was cool and good at her job. Reddit is a corporation; they are privately owned and can fire/hire who they want. They aren't going to disclose the reason. That's between them and Victoria. They could have handled AMA better when she did leave, but they didn't have the contingency in place. Mistakes can be made, so long as they learn and fix.

Do these people think Reddit is their state representative?) that has 160,000+ signatures at this point to fire the woman who made this post, I found it hilarious that she was gilded 13 times.

[This gif basically sums up my reaction perfectly](http://cdn2.sbnation.com/imported_assets/1720529/jaguars-fan-gif.gif).\n\nSecondly, I'd be willing to bet that at least half, if not more than half of those signatures are from people on voat still butthurt over the FPH ban.  I really don't think most people are that invested in this site.  I kind of have to agree with the guy who says that he doesn't care where he consumes content from - whether it's reddit, digg, or the next big thing.  I get a feeling that MOST users are the same.  \n\nThird, I can't figure out why everyone is so angry at her (besides the FPH users who are just irrationally angry people).  The straw seems to have come from Victoria's firing, but really I can't help but feel like that fell on Yishan more than Pao.  The way I see it, is he let the volunteers do the majority of the work by running the sub while using it as an official source of publicity. /r/IAmA is kind of a weird official/unofficial hybrid of a sub-reddit.  \n\nAt some point, someone should have realized the state of it and made it a little more official, whether it meant paying some of the moderators and making them low level admins, requesting some of the admins become moderators to help exchange information, or just taken the sub-reddit and made it policy that all reddit supported AMAs have to go through that sub (which I understand would have left the other subs out dry - but this 3rd solution, while harsh, would have also given them more flexibility with how they handle their biggest source of publicity).  \n\nEither way, it seems that a lot of general frustration at Reddit is being directed at her, which isn't necessarily fair, but that's how it goes.  When you're at the top, all the negativity gets directed at you and that's just how it is.  I think she's handling it well honestly, and I hope her apology is in good faith and not some cooked up PR response.

She made an apology, leave it at that, and stop going on national media talking about how it is a small minority of people upset (even though it is, it still pisses those people off when you point it out so it is not helpful.) \n\nI am just tired of all this drama. Pao will not resign no matter how many times she is downvoted or what online petitions you make. I am sick of the whining about Pao, and I am sick of the people whining about the whining. (Am I now whining about the whining about the whining?) I just want to go back to watching gifs of children falling over and argue about why console gamers are unwashed, I don't want to hear about Pao any more. ",

Muh freeze peach to harass.\n\nEdit for additional effort: it is interesting that that everything they've been doing to clean up the site, make it more accessible for more people, and to hopefully stave off another bout of making the news for being a den of illegal or gross activity, that's \"ruining it.\" Just like how there are hundreds of posts per day directing hateful shit towards the admins, but that apparently isn't something they dislike that they'd censor.

Aftercare is arguably also the most important part of a healthy BDSM relationship.

One commenter even claimed that it was actively difficult to contract HIV and therefore if these men fell ill then clearly they had to really be trying to catch it.\n\nAll of these comments were made with the clear subtext (and sometimes explicit commentary) that these men deserved to die of an illness because of who they were. I read a lot of garbage on reddit, including quite a bit of hateful commentary from very angry people, but reading that thread right after it was posted was like traveling through time back to the 80s, in the worst possible way. \n\nThose comments were initially upvoted.

Most of them get upset at the mention of a condom and others will just ghost you. \n\n\nI was once invited to an orgy and when I asked about protection the host told me that they \"encouraged\" others to use them but not many actually would. Needless to say I was just uncomfortable with the idea of having unprotected sex with multiple strangers. I would say that about 86% of the time other guys will just ask that I am physically clean, as in just out of the shower, for sex. But not for HIV/AIDS.\n\n\nIdk what it is but (again this in only my PERSONAL experience with this) most gay men I speak with about this just don't want to use protection. The exception being cheaters (which i always decline cause of my experience with being cheated on and other personal reasons), bisexual men in open relationships with a woman, and younger bisexual men. \n\n\nI've noticed that younger bisexual guys in their 20s are more willing to use protection that older gay men above the age of 40.

Maybe because my mom was a libtard SJW but I remember plenty of talks about the context Rodney King, Strom Thurmond, OJ Simpson, Cabrini-Greene etc. I listened to the adults around me argue topics like how Clinton's \"reforms\" of welfare would hurt black people, the criminalization of the crack epidemic, racial profiling etc. \n\nMy mom did medical needs foster care while I was growing up and was a big proponent of reunification. Sometimes if a parent was unable to get a ride for visitation or to a class, my mom would drag us all out to drive wherever. Usually somewhere very poor.

Let's look at some of the stuff, shall we?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**OP defending himself:**\n\n**Context**: someone stated that \" Every individual has a skewed version of reality. The Islam youexperience is vastly different from the Islam I experience. \"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Skewed version of reality? The fuck?  \n>  \n>What I'm experiencing is the real Islam. What you are experiencing is Muslims who escaped from these Islamic shitholes countries so that they get more freedom. You are the one experiencing the skewed barely-named Islam, even the real Muslims in Islamic countries downgrade them and look down upon them while calling them \" whores\" and all. What you are seeing are not Muslims, just people identified as Muslims. If Islam was really good, they wouldn't escape from their Islam shitholes to go to USA. Think about it.  \n>  \n>And no, no real Muslim is understanding of LGBT. Go to any Islamic country, don't even think about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Context**: someone asked witch country is OP from\n\n>See? This is what I'm talking about. Americans who try to tell me something I already live.  \n>  \n>Why does it matter which Islamic country? Did it matter when feminism start? Did it matter when LGBT started? Why does it matter now when I'm talking against Islam?  \n>  \n>It doesn't matter which specific Islamic country. When I say Islamic country, I mean generally Islamic countries. Although pretty different on strict levels, we still all have share the Islamic sharia that is largely applied in all of them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**People calling OP out:**\n\n**Context:** Op pulled the *they are not real muslims* card\n\n>This is a straight-up No True Scotsman fallacy. Unless you are an expert in the classifications of Muslims, you cannot decide who is and isn\u2019t a Muslim. Muslims who live in islamic countries are not \u201cmore muslim\u201d than those who do not, since barriers to travel exist and people cannot freely travel around the world to live where they want to.  \n>  \n>Western leftists refer to western muslims when talking about the Islamic religion. These western muslims tend to support progressive ideals, as they are also a minority. You would be *very* hard pressed to find a western leftist who supports the extremely right-wing regime in many Islamic countries, since it runs counter to their ideology. That said, if you do have proof of prominent (read: has reasonable influence) left-wing/liberal people actually supporting right-wing authoritarian regimes, you should provide it. Without that evidence, your argument attacks someone who doesn\u2019t exist.  \n>  \n>I don't think we'll be able to change your mind if a) you aren't providing any sources for those things \"left-wing and liberal people believe in\", and b) it sounds like you're taking minority opinions and pretending they're a consensus of the entire massive group.  \n>  \n>At this moment it's just fighting strawmen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**People even begin to debate if OP is an actual muslim:**\n\n>Based on reading your post and responses here, you\u2019re either:  \n>  \n>A Charlie Kirk plant trying to convince everyone \u201cthis is real Islam, this is why you should fear them\u201d.  \n>  \n>Or  \n>  \n>2. The ultra-conservative Muslim you\u2019re portraying the whole religion as, you just aren\u2019t a fan of committing violence and rape *yourself*. Believing that anyone who doesn\u2019t adhere to a religion as-written, to the word, isn\u2019t \u201creal\u201d is the definition of ultra-conservatism, or as you\u2019d refer to it, as extremists. All the other religions you\u2019ve mentioned have moved on from the ultra-conservative values (for the most part) and have more liberal branches, same with Muslims who have emigrated.  \n>  \n>In the end you are whatever religion YOU say you are, full stop.  \n>  \n>Edit: Just to give you a comparison, there\u2019s a subset of Americans who would shoot someone with a hijab or any hint of Islamic garb on-site. They say anyone who believes that Muslims aren\u2019t the enemy, is gay, believes that there is any room for a socialized public good, or that gun ownership may need a little bit of regulation isn\u2019t a \u201ctrue\u201d American. Are they the true Americans because they say so?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**OP is upset on his (multiple) edits:**\n\n>EDIT:  \n>  \n>Honestly, I feel like made a mistake making this post. I was stupid to think I could make western people understand what ex-Muslims are living in Islamic nations. When you were given a choice and support, we were given a Quran to read and Hijab to wear and a knife if we refuse. So different it's probably impossible to understand until you live in it.  \n>  \n>People will call me a teenage edgelord, I don't care\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>EDIT 4: Some people are saying that I'm trying to change my minds. Well, this subreddit is called [r/changemyview](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/) and the point is that one party makes an opinion and someone else tries to change it, OP has a right to defend his opinion too until he changes his mind.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>EDIT8: Please, for god's sake. No exceptions. Like \"I'm a Muslim and I don't agree with France terrorism...etc\" and all. I couldn't care less about that because I know the truth and the proof(Although rare because of left-wing influence) is still there. Some Muslims always act as exceptions(Like I'm a Muslim and I don't agree with that law that literally exists in Quran) so that they delude and mislead the others from other countries into liking them. Been through it, experienced it, never again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>EDIT10: Ha! Shia are saying that this is bullshit in their subreddit. Might I tell you what Shias believe?

Not because of any danger of censorship, but because it signals what the potential pattern might be going forward. Reddit did not need to accept this money, there were others they could take investments from, why did they choose this company?\n\nReddit executives have stated, plainly, that they stood for free speech and have now accepted money from a company that helped build the censorship state in China. People should be aware of that.\n\nSo yeah, overreaction or not, this is something that needed to be acknowledged and I'm glad it was, even if it was much more gruesome than it needed to be.

Heck, there are guys out there right now who are getting elected into important government positions despite being exposed as child predators, sexists and racists.\n\nBut yes, a Chinese company investing in reddit is the big issue. Do people not realize that China has big stakes in a lot of popular companies already? League of legends, Fortnite, SkyScanner all have far bigger Chinese company ownership stake, and for a far longer period, and what exactly has changed? Not to sound like a conspiracy nut, but if there was ever such thing as a \"distraction\" from bigger issues, this is literally the perfect topic to push. ",

            "This is all completely bonkers.\n\nTencent is a private company that is emphatically ***not*** run by the Chinese government. But even if you were to claim that all Chinese companies operate at the mercy of the Chinese government (which isn't wrong, per se), then it's also worth acknowledging that Tencent, just like all publicly-traded companies, is technically owned by its shareholders, the largest of which is actually a media group in ***South Africa*** (Naspers).\n\nBut ignoring all of that and holding fast to the notion that accepting an investment from Tencent is equivalent to condoning state-sanctioned human rights abuses, it should be noted that Tencent is a ***massive*** organization -- one of the 10 largest in the world by market capitalization -- and its venture funding arm has made investments in a host of popular US technology companies that I'm certain these scandalized Redditors support without a second thought, including:\n\n* Activision Blizzard\n* Epic Games (i.e., Fortnite)\n* Kik\n* Lyft\n* Riot Games (i.e., League of Legends) -- Tencent actually wholly owns Riot Games\n* Snapchat\n* Spotify\n* Tesla\n* Tile\n* Uber\n\nThose are just the names that jumped out at me among their US-based direct investments. Needless to say, their portfolio includes investments in larger investment vehicles that are themselves invested into a variety of companies (including many not captured on my list), as well as direct investments in companies from around the world -- including many popular Asia-based organizations like JD.com and Flipkart.\n\nTencent is such a massive, prominent player in the technology investment community that it would be very hard to avoid using the services and products of companies that have directly or indirectly benefited from an investment by Tencent.",

That said, I'm getting many of the same \"coordinated brigade with an ulterior political agenda\" signals here regarding Reddit's anti-China sentiment that I have gotten with alt-right shilling and astroturfing in the past. I generally find myself asking who stands to benefit (i.e. from increased tensions with China) before I allow myself to be subsumed into the manufactured outrage complex, and in this case I definitely have the suspicion that there are political factions on both sides (in China as well as the US) who would seek to cultivate more hostile or belligerent attitudes between the two nations who are increasingly competing to be the premier economic and military power of the world.",

They said, if I don't show them my penis, it's because I don't have a penis and I must be a girl. I was like 10!! That's straight up sexual harassment. But because it's a locker room, and I'm \"expected\" to get naked in front of others, somehow I'm the asshole in that situation. If I told a teacher, they'd tell me to just get naked and stop worrying about it.\n\nI feel like this whole trans locker room debate is kinda side stepping the real issue to shit on trans people.

With that being said\u2026 \n\nShe said that there were children in there.

Not only that I don\u2019t want my daughter exposed to someone\u2019s penis! I was with a trans woman and I would lose my shit if she was just walking around naked with her dick in my daughter face. Regardless if they identify as male or not! How insane is it to have ppl say \u201coh well, this persons gender identity is more important than your daughter being exposed to a penis\u201d.  So this person can just walk around little girls with their dick just swinging all over the place and it should automatically be okay because of their gender identity?! \n\nWhat\u2019s crazy even more is that forcing this kind of situation to be considered ok is the very reason why all these right leaning conservatives threw a fit about allowing trans in the bathrooms of their gender. Remember how lgbtq supporters all said how fucking ridiculous and reaching for straws that was. Well look how going too fucking far the opposite plays out. This doesn\u2019t help the situation, in fact this makes someone who supported the right for trans to use their respective bathrooms like myself reconsider  if this type of shit isn\u2019t going to be monitored and handled correctly. This is exactly what ppl were afraid of happening. Children being exposed to this sort of thing. That being sexual anatomy. Now i have to step over to the other side and say, if this is allowed what is to stop some perv who calls himself trans to get off on exposing himself to little girls?",

Some eat early, some eat later. If you go to a early eating friend to play, the host was probably not notified and may have too little food to feed one more person. If you know somebody comes over, you cook enough. And then the guest's parents need to know that their kid is eating out and cook a little less. Very simple but remember, no mobile phones existed. You stayed outside if the weather was good until dinner.\n\nAnd you always had to be home for dinner. No excuses. You could call and say you were a little late because you were at a friends house. Mostly no problem there. But heating food without a microwave is not fun and glory. Eating later is better in that case, if it's possible.\n\nSo a perfectly normal thing with reasons not understood by non-Swedes created a perfect storm for nothing.",

            "https://imgur.com/a/IyZPKAs\n\nI got married in a really small town in Sweden. I say town, but it's more like a village. I think maybe 35 or 40 full-time residents\u2014two of whom are my current husband\u2019s parents. His parents have a big yellow house there(yellow circle marked on the map). Very remote very few houses. (One of which is another yellow house marked in green on the map.)\n\r\nAnyway, The village has a big community center with a giant yard where we were going to get married (outside-pink circle marked on the map). And we were pretty much putting all the decorations and food together ourselves( friends and family). Lots of Americans flew in, including my best friend and his husband. We're setting up decorations and fixing it up for the wedding early in the morning there. My best friend woke up late and came to join us. We told him that my future mother-in-law was offering breakfast in the yellow house and pointed him that way. You can probably see where this is going. \r\nHe comes back an hour or two later, regaling me and his husband of this wonderful breakfast with ice cream and pancakes and whipped cream etc. And I was sort of aghast that my mother-in-law had time to do that in the couple hours since I\u2019d seen her because she'd seemed pretty harried before to be honest.\n\r\nAnd we didn't think much about it after that because we were all very busy after that. But a little later the family that lives in the little yellow house nearest the community center started telling this hilarious story about an American who just stopped by and said \u201cI was told to get breakfast here\u201d and since they were an older generation and didn't speak very good English they didn't really get it, but they offered him breakfast and fed him stuff that you get for like big special occasions.(apparently their children were there to visit) I had no idea who these people were. I have never met them. My husband barely knew them. They weren\u2019t invited to the wedding.\n\r\nSo yeah terrible Swedish hospitality that never feed guests.

I was also raised in rural Sweden so maybe that is a factor aswell?\n\nThe fact is that this is not at all as common as some people make it out to be.

This was the case with my house where I'd have a couple of local friends round after school every night but hardly ever went to theirs. I'd usually eat after they'd left, and they'd go home for their dinner. I used to feed them snacks from my kitchen until I saw that it was being treated like a caf\u00e9 (one friend literally called it that), and this put unreasonable financial burden on my mum who was a very generous single parent.\n\nSo there's some distinction between the traditional guest hosting and adolescents hanging out at a host house for a few hours each evening, if it's only ever the one person's home that acts as the social spot. I had another friend where the situation was reversed and his place was the communal destination - I never expected to be fed there because it'd be like four of us packing in his bedroom on a Friday night.\n\nWhen we were children though, either you'd go home when it's time for dinner at your own place or the hosting family would feed you and this would be pre-planned among the parents.",

It simply wasn't part of public discourse until Congress launched an investigation and exposed it.\n\nSimilarly, anyone who claims that Snowden finally exposed the NSA's surveillance capabilities is simply proving that they weren't paying attention before.

It's a writer's room situation. Danuser isn't even Lead Narrative designer. \n\n\nNathanos' art was not made by Denuser. That's an entirely different department that he has nothing to do with.\n\n\nThe questline that people are bitching about is not implemented by the story team. The offending event in question - Nathanos holding his own against a character that recently powered up and should really be kicking his ass - was implemented by the game dev team. It's essentially Nathanos and another character in the background autoattacking each other as set dressing for the Alliance player fighting something else nearby. The game devs are notoriously bad at translating story into gameplay and that is just one example in a long, long list of examples.\n\nHe also gets shit for being a subservient second to the current genocidal maniac woman leading the Horde faction but there's been implications that he's questioning his loyalty, so that might sink the theory that he's a self-insert because the writer has the hots for said maniac.\n\nTL;DR this dude is fond of this character and the edgy queen he serves but literally could not have been responsible for what WoW players are angry about.

Even if Nathanos is a self-insert and those tweets were serious (and not, you know, just the writer getting into the mindset of a character for fun which basically every good writer ever has done) IT DOESNT MATTER.

Main story is intriguing and I have to always remember to do side quests so I don\u2019t blow through the storyline. The design and details of the city are damn awesome. Only things that lack are the ai of npcs, bugs, and optimization",
            "The entire cyberpunk subreddit is a dumpster fire right now, all of the posts can be separated into two major categories:\n\n1. This game is dogshit because _________.\n\n2. Is anyone actually enjoying the game? I\u2019m enjoying it. Are you enjoying it? I don\u2019t understand these people that say they aren\u2019t enjoying it. Why not just enjoy it like the rest of us? It\u2019s a new game, it\u2019s bound to have bugs. Doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t enjoy it. I\u2019m 6 hours in and really enjoying it. It really makes you *feel* like Batman.",
            "Yeah. I left that sub so fast. They're a bunch of idiots and someone screeches at you whether you like the game or not. Just to be clear, I very much enjoyed the game.",
            "Never fails to amuse me when \"gamers\" get angry over a game being buggy and broken because while a lot of people will congregate to say they've found one too, not everyone will have the same experience.\n\nThere was a game six years ago I've forgotten the name of now that was supposedly buggy as hell, but I never personally encountered a single bug in the whole time I played it. Yet, stating as much saw the wrath of a thousand hormonal teens come down upon me for not having the same issue that they had.\n\nAnyway, best way to avoid a buggy game? Buy it months after release date. Any issues will be fixed and it'll be cheaper, too. Maybe it'll also stop the raging hyperbole on top of that.",
            "I upgraded my pc a bit at the beginning of the year. The game looks great for me. I have plenty of fun and I cant wait to play again. \n\nSure there are bugs but I didnt experience a gamecrash or gamebreaking bug yet. \n\nI get a strong Witcher vibe from it - great storytelling interesting quests but occasional stupid bugs and bad mechanics. I think if you arent overhyped you can only love this game.",
            "Honestly I don't see what the big deal is regarding bugs in games these days. Most games come out with bugs, and they're almost always patched up soon enough. I remember when Arkham Knight was an unplayable mess, now it's a solid game. People need to calm the fuck down about bugs, especially in a game that's as anticipated and watched as much as Cyberpunk 2077. There's no way they'd get away with releasing a buggy game and just forgetting about it.",
            "Are all of the game reviewers giving this game rave reviews paid shills as well?\n\nWere the gamergators right all along about 'game journalists'?",
            "From a marketing standpoint, it would be completely idiotic for CDPR to **not** be astroturfing reddit, especially after all the negative PR they've accrued over the last several months.",
            "Gamers these days are thoroughly entitled and throw around the word \"incompetent\" referring to the dev team of the game in question, and act like the presence of any bugs or issues is unacceptable. Literally every game I've ever played has dozens to hundreds to thousands of these people in the subreddit/forums.\n\nMeanwhile if you ask them to point out a game that was perfect and has never had bugs they can't come up with an answer. So to them, *every* studio and dev team are incompetent because they fail to release a flawless, perfectly optimized and amazing game.\n\nPeople with zero understanding of development or the scope of these projects simply shouldn't act like they are some sort of authority on the subject. It's obnoxious.\n\nBugs are inevitable, and understandable. And it takes time to fix them. The less common the bug, the more time it's going to take to figure out *specifically* what causes it, and figure out a fix. \n\nThey would be raging just as hard if every product or patch were delayed indefinitely until 100% of the bugs could be solved. That's not feasible. Things are going to be released with issues.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt doesn't take a shill to point out how childish and stupid these people are being, it just takes someone with even an ounce of understanding of how development works. It's not even my field, I just took a few classes in college, but that's all it took to see how bugs happen, and how they are solved. Magnify the scope 1000x and it's easy to see how these games end up with bugs that can't be nailed down easily.",
            "Well thanks for making learn what a shill was",
            "I've been playing on PC and after a few hours of gameplay, driver updates, setting experiments, and patience I got it running well enough to play for long periods. Running it on a 2070 RTX card too. All ultra, runs about 40FPS most of the time. Here's what I can detract from it so far;\n\n- Far from perfect launch, bugs out the ass.\n- Visually impressive.\n- Core gameplay loop is exactly what I wanted/ needed right now.\n- Acting and characters, good.\n- NPCs are easily one of the worst parts of the game.\n\nOverall, yeah, it's a buggy mess and I'm sure it'll get fixed but it's not worth defending to the grave. Hardware will determine whether or not you get to enjoy this game and that's not a good thing. It's good to accept that something isn't good, don't take trash from AAA companies and defend them for it. This launch was bad and it clearly wasn't worth the employee abuse that got us here and I hope that it goes to show to everyone that crunch doesn't make good products.\n\nMy only advice to everyone having issues with the game, if you have an old hard drive turn on slow hard drive mode and it'll fix you LOD issues at the cost of a few FPS.",
            "Honestly game was par for cdpr and actually cleaner at launch then witcher 3 was. Playing on ps4 and some visual glitches with vehicles in cut scenes and the prostitutes and 2 random crashes in 14 hours of gameplay. I remember my friend saying witcher 3 was untouchable for 2 months ag launch",
            "Dick physics. They have dick physics but nothing can render properly. How do you do dick physics before figuring out render distance.",
            "I checked that sub last night to search for the solution to a particular quest, then noped the fuck out of there. That sub is in full meltdown mode and you can feel the sweaty teenage angst of 15 year old GTX 960 owners raging.",
            "I saw some post with a screenshot from Skyrim and everyone was circle jerking about how it looked better than CP2077. Skyrim isn't densely populated in any city, ladders don't work in the game, and there's a lot less fine detail in the town layouts. People are blowing the bugs out of proportion. I've been playing on 5120x1440 with ultra rtx settings and DLSS on. 2080ti and it plays great, I can see with the technology they used why it would be having a hard time on the previous gen consoles but they're 7 years old and were already outmatched by mid/high level of hardware around that time.",
            "Gamers are always some of the angriest people I've ever met who don't really have any legit reason for being so damn angry all the time.",
            "When I first fired it up, in the garage at the start I had an 'uh oh' moment. Checked the framerate and was getting 30fps,so to the options I a go!\nAutomatically it set everything as ultra, despite being on an i7 4790k and gtx1070, few seconds of dialling things around and I'm playing at 60fps.\nReally should spend more time tweaking at the settings, but idgaf, I'm enjoying it!\nOnly bug I've seen so far was when walking to my apartment first time some dude walked through a closed gate from the market area, mUh iMmErSiOn, tOtAlLy rUiNeD(!)\nBut really if I came across anything else bigger than that, I'll submit an error report and wait on a patch hoping it fixes it, otherwise I'll continue enjoying it!"

Heck she even shows up in his room late at night and tells him it's ok to grope her a little on his birthday. \n\nThat's not a tale of redemption, it's just the author wholeheartedly wanting to share his kink with the world.",

He is fully aware and cognizant of his existence. \n\nQuotes like this make me realize that some people simply cannot comprehend the idea that maybe you don't have to sexualize people (though we all know they only do it to women) all the fucking time. It is his RIGHT to be attracted to CHILDREN because what ELSE can he have?? He must have sex NOW!",

And I\u2019ll admit I thought it was a solid show the first episode. Really great animation and fun side characters. I gave them passes on the first episode pervy jokes because they were pretty obvious and watching the Mc have that weird lecherous grin on his baby face was funny. And with each episode the animation stayed great and the characters they introduced were fun as well. But it just got more and more perverted. Like the mc making creepy comments all the time, eavesdropping or spying on his family/teacher. But again having a creepy pervert character isn\u2019t weird in anime, him being the mc is tho. But then I watched like the 5th or 6th episode where he let a little girl get the crap beat out of her and then at the start of the next episode he finds her sleeping alone in a barn and says \u201chey if you don\u2019t wake up I\u2019m going to attack you\u201d and proceeds to grope a 10 year old girl while she\u2019s asleep. \n\nI stopped right there.

Had to stop that one. \n\nAnime is a medium for storytelling. Some stories are terrible. Some are supposed to be a tragedy. It\u2019s really frustrating to see all cartoons be judged because creepy ones exist. It\u2019s actually really sad that people have so much trouble with healthy boundaries that they would dismiss a whole medium like that.

(flat chested wamen)\". I don't want to spoil too much so i left names hidden. \n\nThe anime itself is getting a really good & faithful adaptation of the series though. The animation & art are really good. The music is pretty good too. The intro shows explores the world and has cool scenes, different each time.  A few of the positives of the series though is the magic system (could be a con too because the main characters are written to be special bc genetics lol), lore and the large world.",

            "How brave of him to make callous responses in a locked sub where no one can call him out.",
            "I 100% do not agree with the mod in question, but I would just like to point out that complaints against the new Trek shows are NOT just from alt-right trolls. I'm extremely left wing (honestly don't understand why any right-wing conservatives might like Trek) and I dislike the new ones. I really got the feeling that the showrunners have no interest in the world/message of Trek, or its progressive and Utopian ideals. The world of Trek, or at least the Federation, was always a socialist post-scarcity society, Kirk literally said that there is no money in their world in ST4 (every time they deal with currency it's always a foreign currency like Latinum for the Ferengi). Everything can be replicated from thin air, of course there's no scarcity. Now in ST Picard (a sequel instead of a prequel) shows trailer parks in the heart of the Federation? Disregarding fandom-specific continuity and details, there is a lot to be said about the questionable political statements of ST Picard.\n\nThe show claims to be pro-refugees and anti-xenophobia, except it portrays the Romulan refugees as racist, xenophobic, literally infiltrating the Federation government, and creating a doomsday weapon in secret. The show also claims to be supportive of android rights, except the androids are literally trying to wipe out all life in the universe. I'm not sure how familiar with sci-fi this subreddit is, but if you've seen Ron Moore's (another old Trek veteran) Battlestar Galactica reboot you'll see how much better that show managed to portray androids in a sympathetic and even likeable manner. Similarly, the show portrays women and homosexual characters almost exclusively as violent and angry arguably to the extent of almost psychopathic. The showrunners want to convince its audience that it's progressive and fails completely to convey that, whether deliberately or accidentally. The show shows that women, gays, minorities, refugees, and androids as violent and diabolical to a comical degree.\n\nCompare this to TOS, being one of the first popular TV shows to show interracial kissing in the '60s (Plato's Stepchildren), and devoting a full episode to talk about the failings of racism (Let That Be Your Last Battleground), or TNG with its discussion of the choice of sex/gender in the '90s (The Outcast), new Trek (I'm arbitrarily making the distinction as post-Abrams/Kurtzman Trek) wanting to pat its back for following progressive trends (and even then, badly) is just pathetic, when Trek has in the past spearheaded progressive movements. To those that say \"don't watch it\" or \"don't bitch about it,\" I don't really do that, and you can check my comment history if you want, but I want to convey that there is plenty to dislike about new Trek even if you're not a right-wing troll.\n\nAnd finally, I again will stress that I 100% disagree with the said mod. I probably will end up quitting r/Star_Trek if nothing changes. I love old Star Trek, its progressive messages and hopes for a better tomorrow. It gives me hope in a way new Trek does not, and hope is very much important, perhaps now more than ever.",
            "I can understand not liking the new Treks, hell I don't, but the extent that people will go to hate on them is absurd. It's like Fallout for me, I'm not a huge fan of the new games but I'm not gonna try and dox the devs.",

Currently watching Voyager.  I *know* Discovery and Picard don't match the quality of TNG and DS9, or even VOY/ENT, which were all fantastic series.  But you know what series didn't match those either?  S1 TNG.  S1 DS9.  People shit hard on TNG when it came out, it wasn't as good as TOS, wasn't \"real trek\".  People shit hard on ENT and it got cancelled RIGHT when it was getting freaking amazing.  I'm still bitter about that.\n\nSo yes, I know Discovery isn't peak trek.  I don't need to hear it over and over and over again.  By people who keep telling me they stopped watching it.  I'm happy to critique certain aspects, I think they failed to adhere to the prime directive in like, the absolute worst way at the end of Season 1.  But we can't have even THOSE discussions if the only discussion we have is the show is trash, and believe me, that conversation was SUPER present ALL the time.\n\nI want the shows to be given a chance to evolve and grow.  I really hope by the time we get to Season 4 of Discovery, we are ranking it up there with all the other Treks. You know, give it a chance to \"grow the beard\", a term that refers to shows improving over time that came FROM Star Trek because of how much TNG grew in quality over time.\n\nI want to be able to talk about the show and watch it grow with people without people shitting all over the place all time time.

            "here is My take.\n\nI felt Discovery season 1 was not great not that bad(trek has a history of bad first seasons since TNG premiered). Season 2 was much better. \n\nI like parts of Picard but not overall.  Lower Decks is too new though I did like the 2nd episode better than. The first.\n\nI have some  problems with current Trek. It's has nothing to do with social justice issue(honestly the Stametz and Doctor relationship is probably one of the best parts of discovery). It has to do with a lack of adhering to the Lore of the seriers(continuity) in both storyline and technology elements that point to the current shownrunners especialky Alex Kurtzman not understanding what Gene Roddenberry was trying to say. Kutzman has stated in interviews he was more of a Star Wars fan than a Star trek fan and It shows.\n\nNote Discovery, Picard and lower decks are stated to take place in the main timeline(the Shatner as Kirk timeline not the Chris Pine as Kirk so called Kelvin timeline)\n\nMy issue with Burnham is not that she is a woman of Color. It's that she is Spock's previously unknown adopted sister. That just screams Member berries to me. I mean they already did Spock having a brother he told no one about in 1988's the final frontier.\n\nWe already had one change in the Klingon make up they decided to change them again for some reason. They also directly contradict some previously established Klingon cultural traditions inn the first episode of Discovery(Klingons do not recover their dead from battle, they view the body as a shell)\n\na lot of The tech on the Discovery is stuff that we see in the shows set a century later(holographic interfaces, holodecks, clothing replicators) all of which are stated to be new 80 years later in the TNG era.\n\nThe Space battles are happen far too frequently and the ships are flying all over the place phasers rapid firing. Compare this to the battles in Wrath of Khan, on the episode Balance of Terror which are more like submarine battles(which would be more accurate to a real space battle in terms of shop movement).\n\nSpock States in the Episode of the original series \"The Tholian Web\" that Starfleet has never had a mutiny in its history up until that episode yet a decade before there was one and it was his sister who did it and it is established as common knowledge among Starfleet personel(everyone on Discovery knew Bunham as the famous Muntineer).\n\nPicard is a continuity mess to even internally.\n\nRomulus was destroyed their Empire is pretty much gone. How the hell would the super duper secret, not even the Tal Shair knows about them Zhatw Cash get the resources to build the 200 highly advanced ships we see in the last two episodes much less crew them and still be so secret that even ex Romulan intelligence agents from the Tal Shiar  who are Picards caretakers in France think they were just a myth.\n\nThough do like how they gave us an explanation for the two different types of Romulan make horsemen in.previous series as an ethnic difference with the Richland with the heavier brow being from A specific continent on Romulus.\n\nA more minor nitpick, smoking was something Gene Rodenberry was vehemently against having characters do in the shows. He stated this in multiple interviews yet we see both the pilot and the woman who calls Picard JL smoke all the time.\n\nGoing back to holographic controls the Discovery crew uses them all the time yet Picard struggles.using them join the show set over 100 years later.\n\nPicard being treated like crap by the chief of Starfleet operations aka Admrial Pottymouth. The man saved the Federation and earth more times than everyone except Kirk and he is treated like deal by them.",

            "Lets go through this and cover all the basics.\n\n**Who is Cleetus McFarland?**\n\nHe's a car youtuber. Cleetus is kind of a stage persona for a guy who started out as a social media manager for 1320video (a drag racing youtube channel). [A short joke created the \"redneck\" persona of his.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPxz1VjDLs8)\nThe content changed from being stupid stuff like turbo whistles and other gimmicks to be a pure bred drag racing channel. Just before the pandemic he bought a small racetrack (Desoto Speedway) for somewhere around 1 million dollars and renamed it Freedom Factory.\nHe's always had events called Cleetus and Cars. Kind of a crazy whacky race day.\n\n**What has happened now?**\n\nCleetus held an event at Bradenton Motorsports Park. Seemed like no cares in the world about COVID, lots of people and no masks. He also made a disclaimer in his video where he pretty much said that COVID is not a big deal and if you are scared stay at home. [Here is a small snippet of it](https://v.redd.it/zpmm44o34x061). He quite quickly disabled comments. He also posted [this on social media](https://i.imgur.com/vIDa7HI.jpg) and [also this](https://i.imgur.com/l0EUkcT.jpg). He later removed his content and seemed to purge his social media from negative comments. \nThere is also a young guy who got quite burned on the event. During a burnout contest a radiator hose broke loose and sprayed the driver with boiling water and steam (the radiatior was relocated to the passanger seat). The car looks unsafe (a car-kart of sorts). And no real tech inspection would clear having the radiator where it was without a firewall or shield. The driver was wearing shorts and ~~t-shirt~~ hoodie (with helmet). Rumor says he was airlifted and put in ICU. [Cleetus posted this](https://preview.redd.it/prh0q8os11161.jpg?width=431&auto=webp&s=174c35ec058f1316350475408700c37285c32c29)\n\n**The Drama**\n\n* People are pissed over the lacking tech standards.\n\n* People are pissed about ignoring COVID.\n\n* People are pissed about Cleetus response.\n\n* Moderator (and founder?) leaving the Cleetus sub and deleting his account.

Had there been no Anschluss and no world war, it would have fallen apart in 1940-1941.\n\nSimilarly, bringing structure to the education is extremely deceptive about what actually happened.

The poverty and oppression of one group (blacks) propped up the success and prosperity of another (the new white middle-class). \n\nThe same with the Nazis. When you reappropriate millions of dollars worth of property and industry while removing millions from the work force and forcing them to be slave labor, its no wonder that you can make your economic numbers look better after a decade or more of hyperinflation, depression, and reparation payments. And that's not even taking into account the pillaging they did of Europe, their reappropriation of foreign industry, and their dismantling of rival governments and economies.\n\nEdit: Of course, blacks weren't the only oppressed racial minority in 1950s America.

The moment they took on someone who had their shit together they got their shit kicked in, and they had to take them on because they were desperate for resources!

I don't know anything about the streamer so maybe she makes enough to support herself, but most 18-year-olds don't. \n\nHow do they expect someone to turn 18 and immediately support themselves? They don't know how to pay bills, lease, etc., and will need guidance + a guarantor. They likely don't have well-paying jobs and are also likely in college. They don't have the resources to support themselves. She may be an adult on paper, but she's really still a teen. \n\nAnd it's absolutely her parents' job to support her until she can support herself.

We have had a few foreign transplants tried to start an anti vax movement but nobody was really buying it and it has petered out. I dont think anyone cares about chem trails or whether jet fuel can melt steel beams.\n\nEven in respect to the mask mandates. In India there hasnt been an anti mask movement or the whole COVID denial nonsense. There hasnt been any opposition to the mask mandate unlike the USA, the only issue has been that people stopped wearing masks ( at one point) since the number of cases reduced.\n\nThis is interesting considering that countries like the USA have better education levels and quality of education. Access to information is also better. There is a better healthcare system also.\n\nHowever, we also have our BS, where the govt for a short while touted cow urine as a possible COVID cure, but that is on the course for our present government. That has been wideky ridiculed and the government also seems to have backtraked on it. We have also had a Chief Minister direct that Nitrogen be converted into Oxygen and that also has earned him ridicule.\n\nIm saying this not just in response to the present post but also other posts where someone claimed to have suddenly fallen sick after their son got the covid shot (turns out they went for a barbecue and got food poisoning) and the one where someone kept spraying vinegar at their kids.",

Not at all comparable to George Floyd, that was stupid, but I can see where the person making that comparison was coming from - the right vilified George Floyd to justify making fun of his death, and the left seem to be doing the same for her (albeit less so).

            "> She feels that my mom and stepdad look down on how we parent.\n\nOP's wife is a fucking psycho, and OP doesn't sound much better.",
            "The deleted OP text, for context:\n\n>For some background my mom and my wife had issues from the beginning. It took years for them to even be able to be civil. We are both huge on family so my wife knew I was never going to just cut my mom off, but I did stand up for her. \n\n>My mom got married around the time we did and had two more kids. My younger sisters are around the same age as my son and daughter and that has always been a point of contention with my wife. She feels that my mom and stepdad look down on how we parent. I don\u2019t think they have been rude about it, but when the kids are all the same age it comes up sometimes. \n\n>My wife tends to get annoyed when my mom gives my sisters something that our kids aren\u2019t allowed to, and she thinks my mom is snobby because my sisters are barely allowed electronics and my mom is super against any form of daycare. I think my mom and stepdad are just out of touch. He was born with a silver spoon and never had to work that hard, has lots of free time, and my mom is a stay at home mom with housekeepers. They take my sisters out a lot and my kids are jealous because we don\u2019t have the time or money. My mom also refuses to babysit because our kids aren\u2019t well behaved and doesn\u2019t really care that we are working on it. \n\n>I also have a 17 year old stepsister \u201cAmber\u201d she is ok but keeps her distance from my wife and I. She is very close to my mom and kind of possessive of the two sisters we share. She has been rude to my wife but my mom says it is just teenage hormones and her and my stepdad don\u2019t discipline, they just talk to their kids a lot.\n\n>Ok sorry for all that backstory. So we recently were at a theme park with all the kids. My wife and I had been in the changing room with our kids and no one knew we were back. Amber was walking in the parking lot with my two little sisters and the seven year old says she feels bad for my kids because we don\u2019t seem like a happy family and she would be sad if my wife was her mom. Obviously that is one of the worst things a woman can hear and I tried to comfort my wife. Amber who had her back to us and still didn\u2019t see us, respond that it\u2019s because we don\u2019t know how to parent, our kids are animals, and she tells my mom to just be done with us.\n\n>My wife just snapped and punched amber in the back of the neck. She fell and scraped her knees but was mostly fine. She said her neck hurt but I feel like she was also playing it up for her dad. My stepdad went full on ballistic, called the cops, called my wife every name in the book. I understand it was totally wrong but I don\u2019t think the police had to get involved. He stopped my mom from cleaning Ambers knee because he wanted it to look bad when the cops got there.\n\n>My wife was arrested and is being charged with assault, which is worse because she is a minor. I called my mom and begged her to do something but she just says it\u2019s up to Ambers mom and dad. Now my stepdad is saying my wife can never be around my sister again, my wife blames my mom, and I don\u2019t know what to do. My mom is being smug and acting like my wife deserves this, but these charges could really effect our lives and her job opportunities.

            ">Someone who lost it in the moment ?\n\nIt's wild to me that the 'defense' depends on this line of thinking. It's not like people who don't assault children don't understand being enraged. Rage and anger and annoyance are a normal human experiences that we all deal with. \n\n'Losing it in the movement' means you *failed* at civilized conduct, you should be *embarrassed* and *remorseful,* and yeah, if you consistently can't get your temper under control, you should be isolated from society as a whole, or at least from the people that trigger that reaction in you. I hate prisons as much as the next leftest, but like... 'I just lost it' as a defense for assault, in my opinion, isn't a view held by functional member of a society.  It's not a view that a healthy society should even tolerate, a group of people that who can so easily justify extreme violence like that is just a lynch mob in waiting. \n\nIt's kind of super surreal to me that this view of violence is just starting to become mainstream and is still a point of contention (heartening to see how downvoted it is though). It's not even that I think violence is always un-justifiable, just that the bar *needs* to be higher than 'a teenager with their back turned said something I didn't like so I lost it.' \n\nLike in full honesty, this rant is so long because it's directed at my past. It's not a view I've always held, I used to have an insane temper that I thought didn't actually speak ill of my character because I 'mostly' kept it under control and was 'mostly' a good person. It's *easy* to fall into this line of thinking if you're steeped in violence, if it seems like violence is the only possible solution, if enablers are constantly telling you that you're a 'good person who just lost it in the heat of the moment.' This 'violence is always justifiable if I get to a certain level of angry' mentality plagues societies all over the world, throughout all of time. That doesn't make it okay, it just means it's a disease that humans are prone to and something we can and should recover from if we ever want to advance, as individuals and as a species.",

It's should thoroughly address anything a pro-ivermectin person is saying about it.\n\n----\n\n3 studies the ivermectin pushers have been present everywhere as \"evidence\"\n\n1. [The FDA-approved drug ivermectin inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2 *in vitro*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354220302011) (*\"See! ivermectin works!\"*)\n2.

[Review of the Emerging Evidence Demonstrating the Efficacy of Ivermectin in the Prophylaxis and Treatment of COVID-19](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8088823/) (*\"It's been proven to work in the field!\"*)\n\nBut let's take a look at these 3 and only use a high school level understanding of science.\n\n\\#1 **The FDA-approved drug ivermectin inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2** ***in vitro***\n\n> reports suggested that ivermectin's nuclear transport inhibitory activity may be effective against SARS-CoV-2.\n\n> To test the antiviral activity of ivermectin towards SARS-CoV-2, we infected Vero/hSLAM cells with SARS-CoV-2 isolate Australia/VIC01/2020 at an MOI of 0.1 for 2 h, followed by the addition of 5 \u03bcM ivermectin. Supernatant and cell pellets were harvested at days 0\u20133 and analysed by RT-PCR for the replication of SARS-CoV-2 RNA\n\n> By 48 h this effect increased to an ~5000-fold reduction of viral RNA in ivermectin-treated compared to control samples, indicating that ivermectin treatment resulted in the effective loss of essentially all viral material by 48 h.\n\nSo cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2, left two hours and then bathed in a 5 \u03bcM solution of ivermectin. 48 hours later the COVID had been wiped out. \n\nBut what kind of dose is that? What is a 5 \u03bcM solution? \n\nA 5 \u03bcM solution is 5 micro (\u03bc) moles (M) of a substance per Liter. The molecular weight of ivermectin is 875.1 g/mol. So this solution was a concentration of **4375.5 \u03bcg/liter**.\n\n\\#2 **Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of Escalating High Doses of Ivermectin in Healthy Adult Subjects**\n\n> Subjects (n = 68) were assigned to one of four panels (3:1, ivermectin/placebo): 30 or 60 mg (three times a week) or 90 or 120 mg (single dose). The 30 mg panel (range: 34 7-594 microg/kg) also received a single dose with food after a 1-week washout. Safety assessments addressed both known ivermectin CNS effects and general toxicity. The primary safety endpoint was mydriasis, accurately quantitated by pupillometry. Ivermectin was generally well tolerated, with no indication of associated CNS toxicity for doses up to 10 times the highest FDA-approved dose of 200 microg/kg.\n\nSo though the maximum FDA recommended oral dose is 200\u03bcg/kg of body weight people could take a 30\u00b5g dose once every 3 days for a short period of time (which represented 347-594 \u00b5g/kg oral dose depending on the participant) or a single 120mg dose (1404-2000 \u00b5g/kg) and be fine a week later.\n\nBut that's just the oral dose. You pee most of that straight out. The first study is talking about the concentration applied directly to the cells.\n\nThankfully Figure 3 in this paper is *Mean plasma concentration (ng/ml) profiles of ivermectin following single oral doses of 30 mg* (1ng/ml = 1\u03bcg/liter) This graph shows the concentration of ivermectin in blood after a 30mg dose peaking briefly at 250ng/ml at 7 hours after the dose. But it is down to 50ng/ml at 12 hours after and 30ng/ml at 48 hours out.\n\n30ng/ml is 1/146 the concentration used in the first study. And that's already 1.5-3x the FDA recommended dose. Assuming oral dose and blood concentration scales linearly (it doesn't) **you would need to take 219-438x the FDA recommended dose**. Which would very certainly make you very dead.\n\n----\n\n\\#3 **Review of the Emerging Evidence Demonstrating the Efficacy of Ivermectin in the Prophylaxis and Treatment of COVID-19**\n\nThis one is a meta-study in which most of the data is based on the study [Efficacy and Safety of Ivermectin for Treatment and prophylaxis of COVID-19 Pandemic](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-100956/v4) which is actually just a garbage fire. It has mismatch between the data and conclusions, impossible data, fake data, and plagiarism.\n\nThere are wonderful takedowns of it here:\n\n- [Why Was a Major Study on Ivermectin for COVID-19 Just Retracted?](https://grftr.news/why-was-a-major-study-on-ivermectin-for-covid-19-just-retracted/)\n\n- [Some problems in the dataset of a large study of Ivermectin for the treatment of Covid-19](https://steamtraen.blogspot.com/2021/07/Some-problems-with-the-data-from-a-Covid-study.html)\n\nMy favorite excerpt:\n\n> Where the copying is not verbatim, the author\u2019s appear to have employed techniques more commonly used by students to disguise plagiarism, for example, by using synonyms or changing one or two words.

Ivermectin definitely has medical uses - it is one of the most well studied antiparasitic drugs in the world approved for human use. Its so common that its one of the drugs you learn about even as a medical student. Commonly used to treat hookworm infections for instance. It\u2019s not some obscure veterinary-only drug like much of the media sold it as.\n\nThat being said this guy and the people that support him on the covid argument are just plain wrong about their arguments. Watching his interview with sanjay gupta is illuminating and really shows just how willfully ignorant rogan is on this topic. It\u2019s funny how a lot of people on the right use that interview to credit rogan, but if you watch the interview little of what he says makes medical or scientific sense and he performs a lot of mental gymnastics to defend his antivax position.",
            "I don't understand why it's so controversial to say that these two things can exist simultaneously:\n\n1. Joe is a dangerous hypocrite for downplaying Covid to millions of people but then when getting the virus, gaining access to a battery of drugs and treatments that are inaccessible to 99% of the population.\n\n2. CNN is 100% guilty of lying about Ivermectin and lying to their audience that Joe took horse dewormer instead of doctor prescribed Ivermectin. Then doubling down when called out on that despite being caught in the lie.\n\nBoth of these things are true.

In that case talking about people taking horse paste is an entirely legitimate claim. \n\nI think some people are concerned that making fun of using Ivermectin may stigmatize its use in valid medical settings (like treating parasites). It is kind of over the top that someone who explicitly states that Ivermectin is not effective against Covid and that Joe Rogen is an idiot for taking it is getting downvoted that hard just for stating that it has uses outside of horse medicine. \n\nAt the same time, some people seem to use this argument to portray a veneer of being reasonable until a little probing shows they are also anti-vaccine or pro Ivermectin for Covid.\n\nSome people are using horse paste to treat Covid which is ineffective and dangerous. Some people are taking human dosage Ivermectin to treat parasites like River Blindness and that's effective and doesn't need to be made fun of.

This causes players to physically interact with each other. There are limitations to how far away from points of interest called pokestops and gyms (in the real world these are things like statues and art and unique businesses).   \n\n\nLast year due to covid, the creators of the game Niantic extended this interaction radius from 40m to 80m.

Of course this is cheating and you risk your account being banned. \n\nA way to circumvent this is trying to appear human in your mouse movement and play time etc. So I began to learn how to make my own scripts eventually coming to a wall as my I.P had been flagged and Jagex (the company making the game) sent cease and desists stating that I was to never make a script by myself or with another human again.\n\nI was distraught I wanted to become the best bot maker there was but lacked the legality to do so. Then I suddenly had an idea. \n\nI began to train my dog in Java scripting it started off slow trying to use his paws on the keyboard but eventually he mastered the movement and began to code. \n\nHe first made me a simple script for woodcutting which soon become the most popular and technologically advanced script there was in terms of anti ban. \n\nAs his script portfolio began to increase so did his skills, he had became such a amazing scripted he made an expansion pack for the game that injected itself into the main game. \n\nEventually I was contacted by Donald Trump himself in 2008 as he noticed my dog had solved fusion and wanted to patent it make me rich.

Although it had its flaws and significant bugs at release, the game developed a cult following with fans patching the game and adding new content over the last 15 years. There have been rumors of a sequel for years and in 2006, White Wolf was purchased by CCP (the devs of EVE Online) who were developing an MMO based on the universe until it was cancelled in 2014. The following year, Paradox (developers best known for their grand strategy games like Crusader Kings) aquired White Wolf. Yesterday, they finally announced Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 and drama quickly followed.\n\n[With news that the game will be set in Seattle and discuss politics like the tech boom's impact on the city and allowing the player to heavily customize their character including choosing their pronouns](https://www.vg247.com/2019/03/21/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-political-character-creator/), some people aren't happy.\n\n\n[Keep politics out of my video games](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/b439yy/comment/ej3vc6w)\n\n[Stop pandering to the woke crowd](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/b42zdq/comment/ej45i9s)\n\n[Does painting a certain viewpoint as bad alienate half your audience?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/b42zdq/comment/ej3xwwo)\n\n[Someone isn't a fan of the option of choosing your pronouns](https://snew.notabug.io/r/Games/comments/b42zdq/comment/ej45rki)\n\n",

I'd like to keep my guns, legalize marijuana, allow more paths for legal immigration, keep illegal immigration to a minimum, fund Planned Parenthood, ensure a woman's right to make her own choice about abortion, shore up some loopholes in tax regulations, have a strong military, not call people by fake pronouns (Christ, as an English teacher, it drives me up a goddamned wall; we have gender-neutral pronouns already and the entire fucking point of a pronoun is that it's easily used in lieu of a name as an identifier-- ugh-- this is the one left-leaning thing that makes me want to a punt a fucking baby), and so forth. I'm fucked with voting, because it depends entirely on the issue. I have to admit, I'm more likely to vote for Republicans when it comes to economics/agriculture and more like to vote for Democrats when it comes to social systems/education.\n\nThis is said:\n\n>Plenty of others are already giving you a well-deserved drubbing for your /r/ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM but I think this is probably worth diving into a bit, if only for illustrative purposes.\n\n>First, and most obviously, you aren\u2019t a fucking moderate. A moderate isn\u2019t someone with a mixture of hard left and hard right beliefs. A moderate is someone who favors measured responses to issues (as opposed to risking overreaction, or doing nothing). Your particular hodgepodge of political beliefs doesn\u2019t paint you as a moderate. It paints you as someone who hasn\u2019t done the difficult but necessary work of critical self-examination to arrive at a coherent belief system. There is no underlying political philosophy that informs your stances. You just picked whatever beliefs sounded superficially smart in the moment.\n\n>Second, hating on personal pronoun choice is a really weird hill to choose to die on. Of literally all your positions, it is likely the one with the least potential personal impact on yourself (and by a long shot). There are plenty of great arguments for pronoun choice (which I\u2019m not here to explain for you but which you owe to yourself to do the research on), but the strangest facet of this is definitely your insistence that, as an English teacher, you can\u2019t stomach a language evolving as social change occurs.\n\n>The most influential English teacher I had made a point of drawing attention to a poster on the wall of the classroom, with this E.B. White quotation on it:\n\n>\u201cThe living language is like a cow-path: it is the creation of the cows themselves, who, having created it, follow it or depart from it according to their whims or their needs. From daily use, the path undergoes change. A cow is under no obligation to stay.\u201c",

But gMendez the owner of the old server was one of the worst people I've ever had to work with. He'd demote people for questioning his decisions, he'd promote random people to staff who he liked, he did not **CARE** about the community. His last message on the server was from over 2 months ago. The server was something I worked 13 hours a day on, every day, for the last 3 months. I put my life into that server, just for mendez to do this. He approached me a few days ago asking if it was possible to **sell** discord servers. Something that put me, and the entire staff team into a panic. We tried looking into possibilities of getting the server, however he wanted upwards of several thousand dollars for it. It seems he sold, or he just didn't like my attitude. I received no warning, no message, nothing. Just a demotion. This server was set up by the ENTIRE staff team, mods, middlemen, raid helpers, giveaway helpers, and coaches. All banded together to get this server together. I apologise if you disagree with my actions, but I'm not allowing a man who would **DOX** me to take over the server that I loved, the community that I loved.\"\n\nPoor guy dude, fuck gMendez honestly.",
