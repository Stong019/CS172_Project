            "*Sigh*\n\nOk, so this image has been circulating for a few years now. For starters, **it's completely outdated.** Of the 5 mods (not 4) on the list, 1 has deleted their account, 1 got suspended and dipped, 1 has quit Reddit. Only 2 of them mod in any capacity anymore, and turtle basically just sticks to trolling in a half dozen subs these days because idk he's fucking weird.\n\nI'll state that again: **The claim that the biggest subs are controlled by only 5 people is blatantly, objectively wrong**. Takes like 30 seconds to prove this.\n\n[Here's a brilliant comment explaining all the context around this image](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/12nqufv/whats_going_on_with_routoftheloop/jgg4gxq/). The tl;dr is that when it was posted initially it led to an enormous amount of unwarranted harassment towards all mods that got so bad the admins had to get involved and make an official statement. The situation was capitalised on by far right groups in subs like /r/the_donald and /r/cringeanarchy to perpetuate a full-on harassment campaign towards big mods (who generally steer left wing like most of Reddit). It worked spectacularly, and every time it makes the rounds it's the exact same thing.\n\nNowadays far right pricks just post these images in a deliberate attempt to get a reaction from mods, then hop on /r/conspiracy and similar subs to proclaim they've censored by the evil mod overlords. This shit is Joel Michael Singer levels of reactionary circlejerk, but more malicious. The intent with them posting this stuff is that it'll inevitably lead to Reddit doing... Well, exactly what it's doing right now, getting riled up at nothing and harassing a bunch of people. And it works every fucking time. \n\nI used to be in the whole mod scene, these days I don't really give a shit but I was around the first time this thing blew up. Believe me when I say the reaction from Reddit was absurd and absolutely warranted the draconian response. One fun incident that happened, just as an example, was that one of the mods was doxxed, people photoshopped nudes of them, and started spreading misinformation saying that they'd been sending said nudes to children. And because Reddit was running wild with their hate boner, they just took that as gospel. Never mind that the images were blatantly fake, who needs fact checking when mods are literally raping your babies or something?!?!?!? There have been mods who have had to get the FBI involved over this stuff because they've had legitimate threats on their life. \n\nWhat are mods supposed to do in response to this? If they leave it up, they allow for harassment and let the hivemind go wild, and allow the assholes who want said harassment to get precisely what they want. If they remove it, it causes shit like this to happen, where more bad actors come in and cry censorship, conspiracy, etc, and amplify it as much as they can. It's a lose-lose situation based purely on Reddit's inability to verify information before going on a rampage. The only option really is to quietly remove and hope.",

Somebody finds it every 6 months and reposts it and meanwhile at least one of the people on that list doesn't even have an account anymore.\n\nNumber two, there's a certain gravity to things like moderating large subreddits. The largest subreddits on this site are not going to pick a brand new moderator who has never been in charge of a subreddit of size. So you start out moderating something small, and then you move up to something larger, and then you move up to something larger, and most of the time you don't leave the ones you were already in. And eventually, yes, you are moderating extraordinarily large subreddits because you are the type of person who has experience moderating somewhat extraordinarily large subreddits and below. This should not come as a surprise to anyone. This is literally how all organizations work. You don't find yourself CEO of a Fortune 500 company fresh out of high school.\n\nNumber three, every time this gets posted, the exact same conspiracy theories run rampant about how these super moderators have somehow formed a hideous cabal of control over this meme and porn wonderland despite absolutely no evidence that any of these people are actually doing anything wrong. It's entirely possible some of them are total douchebags but odds are good if you're complaining about how hard they are censoring you, you are probably saying things that ought to get taken down anyways. Frankly, I would love for somebody to find and share a W-2 that one of these so-called gods of Reddit are earning from wasting a ton of their free time on this website. People seem to believe they are somehow earning money from this, but just like the whole people with huge karma accounts can sell them thing, I don't ever see anybody actually posting any actual evidence.\n\nEverybody wants to see a conspiracy theory when the reality is these are just nerds like us that just have a little bit more spare time to spend blocking bigots and shitposters.\n\nEdit: bring on the downvotes, folks. People are so desperate to believe that there's some grand conspiracy here and the reality of it is probably just boring as hell.

It's not an adequate reflection of the genuine talent of the traditional and 3D animators because they have to work on stupid levels of crunch from week to week for months of production and pre-production, while being mired in the toxicity of Japanese work ethics/culture.\n\nI love(d) the series and I'm still waiting on the BR release of S4 to smooth the edges before I watch it, especially in the CG department.",
            "I missed well written drama posts like this. Thank you OP",
            "Animation is an incredibly grueling industry. For the most part it is very technical 'grunt work', making drawings over and over and over to get your animation pieces (obviously simplifying, but you get the point). This isn't an isolated incident, but is industry wide, coupled with many Japanese companies having the mantra of: \"work till you die, work is the highest priority, it is all you have, it is the highest honor\". \n\nIn Attack on Titan, [this sequence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neaqIUMRdzI) took **months** to iterate, tweak, develop, create and polish. This stuff, if you want a healthy work environment, takes time and a lot of time. Part of the reason why the Titans started becoming CG is because making them with all their details in 2D is an incredible amount of work (even WIT 'cheated' with the Colossal Titan - they drew it because it didn't really 'move' so much in earlier seasons, but made it CG in the later seasons for the battle scenes) which is another problem of adapting manga (comics known for incredible detail) into animation (known for movement - great animation simplifies for their fluidity). \n\nThe unfortunate reality is that the animators get crunched on both sides. The studios need to meet their financials and push for faster releases. At the same time if you take too long than the rabid fanatics start getting angry and lobbing death threats (see Cyberpunk) and more importantly the 'silent majority' moves on and loses interest and you lose a lot of sales. \n\nI just wish fanbases were just willing to wait. Even years. We aren't in some scarcity of entertainment and I'd rather have things take too long but everyone in the industry is working their best and happy rather than live right now where we have too much entertainment on the backs of these animators blood, sweat and tears. You know most of the people who complain about stuff like this only do so because they already hate the property and wanted another punching bag and you'll see them again in 6 months time complaining about the animation and story again. \n\nSigh....",

I immediately told him to stop and apologized for that, but again, it was extremely light and the man didn't even seem to be in pain from it, so I didn't think much of it.\n\n> Fast forward to the day after and two police officers show up at our doorstep, and we find out that our neighbor will be pressing charges against my son. Nothing like this has ever happened to me so I really don't know what to do here.

At this point I heard the shouting and came outside, which was when I witnessed the kick. Again, it was very light and done only because our neighbor was trying to physically push him. The neighbor was in a rage at this point and they were both butting heads, which was when I intervened and pushed the neighbor to the ground. This is not something I would have done had we not been standing on soft grass, I knew full well that this would not result in injury and I was trying to break up the scuffle. I would really rather this next part not have happened, but once he was lying with his back on the ground my son delivered a light kick to him. I immediately told him to stop and apologized for that, but again, it was extremely light and the man didn't even seem to be in pain from it, so I didn't think much of it.\n\nI love the terminology.\n\nHe 'calmly explained to the man' and 'grabbed his shoulders and attempted to turn him around and attempted to nudge him to his house' (what a nice lad!) and he 'lightly kicked his kneecap' too! He was lying on the ground and the son delivered a LIGHT kick as well.\n\nThis son sounds like a humanitarian!!",
            "tl;dr: Neighbours should treat me like a wild gorilla, averting their gaze as I stroll past\n\nPS: not my fault!",
            "Sure, my son grabbed an old man by his shoulders with both hands, but only to \"turn him around and [gently] nudge him back to his own home.\" I would think an elderly man like that would appreciate some assistance getting home. Now, it's true, when the old man \"started shouting and tried to push back, my son, quite reasonably, [ran around him and] lightly kicked his kneecap.\" I mean *lightly*, I saw it. Just a really light, little toe-tap to the kneecap. Like you would use to scold a naughty puppy. That did not hurt, believe me. Unfortunately, this old man is a little senile and did not get how well he was being treated. So, he started butting heads with my boy. \n\nThat's when I intervened and broke up the scuffle by pushing the old man to the ground. I thought this would be a nice way to end the conflict -- for him, I mean -- laying on his back \"on soft grass,\" where you, \"know full well they won't be injured.\" Before the man could thank me though, my son delivered [another] light kick,\" or maybe, like, two to five kicks but they were \"extremely light\". They basically added up to about one medium-light kick. I would just count that whole thing as one kick, really. Of course, I am trying to teach him to be the bigger man. I told him to stop and said, *Son, you only kick a man once, when he's down.* \n\n\"The man didn't even seem to be in pain.\" So, I knelt down -- on the old man's chest -- and softly bit his ear, you know, just until I tasted the tiniest, little soup\u00e7on of his blood. The whole beating was over so quick, \"I didn't think much of it,\" until, \"[T]wo police officers show up at our doorstep.\" And I was like, *What??? That old man is pressing charges over that?!*\n\n\nEDIT: Made up some more gratuitous details, deleted others.",

I didn't even know anything about the game before the controversy, and because of what they said now I know it exists and it looks like something I'd be interested in playing, I never would have known about them if they stayed on Steam.

This is on top of the inconvenience of taking a few minutes to set up an extra account. \nWe can\u2019t fight the corporations man. I mean we could simply not buy the games from egs and undercut their business model which is clearly failing as everyone on reddit is boycotting them but I really wanna  play the games man. \nWe could also just quietly pirate the games but that hurts the dev scene man and that\u2019s not what we want to do the hardworking devs. So clearly our only rational response is to send them death threats , racial slurs , misogynistic bile and review bomb their games.\nI hope you guys understand our point of view now. We could just boycott them but our hate boners need to be put down so pls don\u2019t think we\u2019re basement dwelling trolls, we are simply customers left with no choice but to wage a harassment campaign against the greatest customer injustice in recent memory.",

These immature bastards just can't seem to get it through their heads that being shitty, stupid, toxic and harassing doesn't get their point across. It in fact helps to do the opposite.",
            "I agree with steam, I've had to stay away from that shit with pcgaming it's so toxic it feels like I've developed a cancerous tumor of pure anger and absence of humanity. I disagree with Epic Games policies, but I'm not gonna go that far with some of the shit some people did.",
            "I mean, it's all about thr money for the company, EGS probably takes less than 10% of net 8ncome for royalty fee, ehich to company could be 10-20% more income.... Who wouldn't want that. Tbh, i want everything to be on steam, but we can't allow monopoly like that can we?",

            "I genuinely don\u2019t get the thought process. I hate Epic\u2019s policies and the way they behave just as much as anyone else, heck it broke my heart to learn the game I was looking forward to (Ooblets) had been freely advertising on Steam just to go Epic exclusive and patronize their customers. However, these are still human beings and just because they slight us or screw us over doesn\u2019t mean they deserve death threats or to be treated poorly in return. All it does is make YOU look bad. You\u2019re not going to get them to fix the issue, you\u2019re just reinforcing their decision, and if anything just giving them ammunition to keep doing it. \n\nI would love to sit and complain all day long about greedy developers or how toxic the EGS is, but complaining about decisions being made and the morality behind them =/= calling human beings names, threatening their lives, and ultimately anything in between over a literal video game. Yes, they called us things first. Yes, they went back on their word. So keep using that. Keep using their own words and promises against them, but don\u2019t submit to threatening anyone, it will literally never solve any of these issues and, in reality, just makes them worse.",
            "The whole EGS \"discussion\" has just been misinformation and deceit from the start. As far as I see it, the only thing that Steam has over most EGS games that actually matters is cloud saving. But we know that epic can support cloud saves, and has supported it for certain games.\n\n  Beyond that, these Steam fanboys are just fighting for stupid shit that wouldn't affect games like BL3, things like steam profiles, marketplace, etc.\n\n   Yes we all know Steam has had a lot more dev time put into it, having been a storefront for much longer. But EGS really isn't the mess that this toxic community would have you believe. And if you look at their trello, you can see how much progress they have made. If BL3 doesnt have cloud save support, they have the right to be mad, but beyond that, the rest of their argument for \"boycotting\" (you know most of them will get it anyway) is a bunch of bullshit.",
            "People should get over the epic store thing, it's not going to go away.\n\nIt's just like first there was Netflix. Now more and more companies are taking their stuff from Netflix and putting it on their own service.\n\nSoon you'll need 20 subscriptions to stream 20 of your favorite shows.\n\nSoon (almost there!) You'll need 20 different Steam clones installed to play your 20 favorite games.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's a \"Meh\" issue to me.\n\nNot hurting anything on my computer to have multiple stores installed, and desktop icons still exist.",

            "I went down this rabbit hole for hours. I\u2019m fairly new to Reddit, so I don\u2019t know the history of this guy In the drama. I kept finding links with context of just how fucking coocoo this dude is.\n\nGo down far enough and there was a link to him getting arrested. Mugshot? Exactly what you\u2019d expect: neckbeard. The kind of neckbeard that\u2019ll make you say \u201che sholdn\u2019t be around children.\u201d His mom\u2019s boyfriend took his headphones or broke them (I don\u2019t remember), bought him a new pair of headphones he didn\u2019t like, so he broke his mom\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s door, tv and air conditioner. He was staying at his mom\u2019s bf\u2019s house for free and still thought it was unfair because he had to live by his rules. He also thought his mom\u2019s bf was an asshole because instead of buying him another new pair of better headphones, he bought another air conditioner. He described it as \u201cbuying his way out of consequences.\u201d\n\nGot down further to a link of him describing himself 6.8 years ago. I guess he\u2019s been a narcissist since birth. Context: he messaged the CEO of some company and posted his response. I guess he wanted to be a billionaire and everyone in the thread told him to be realistic with his aspirations. It wasn\u2019t so much that it isn\u2019t possible, but that he kept underestimating everyone else in the world. He responds to everyone with a *long* description of himself and why he could do it. Half of it was of how smart he was, and the other half was how mature he was for his age (I believe he was in high school at the time).\n\nThis is a small part of his explanation of why he\u2019s so mature:\n\n>\tI believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn\u2019t just faking it, I\u2019d even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self\u2019s actions, it shouldn\u2019t be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them.\n\nAt was at this point that I realized it was 9:01 AM, which is far too early to be reading \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have killed Hitler\u201d on reddit. This is a perfect mixture of not thinking before you type, edginess, stupidity, and narcissism known to man. \u201cI\u2019m against execution, even the execution of someone who ordered the execution of 11 million innocent people.\u201d\n\nEdit: added more context",

            "It should be noted that I've upvoted every single person who's disagreed with me here, as far as I know.\n\nThat said.\n\nIn 7th grade, I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn't do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area.\n\nAn IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test.\n\nMy mother's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but I've met lots of other engineers who aren't as good as me at physics, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it.\n\nI'm also pretty good at engineering. I don't have a degree, and other than physics I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan).\n\nI have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I've come across. Every question of existentialism which I've seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven't been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I've considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is.\n\nPsychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there's no aspect of psychology which I don't have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud's theories.\n\nI'm a good enough writer that I'm writing a book and so far everybody who's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that's not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I've heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it.\n\nI don't know if that will suffice as evidence that I'm intelligent. I'm done with it, though, because I'd rather defend my maturity, since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code.\n\nI believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it, I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them.\n\nI don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I don't have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don't care what a person's fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don't have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things.\n\nI love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone.\n\nI'm pretty much a pacifist. I've taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I'll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don't attack, I'll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don't fight back. I've therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious, because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that I'm never in a situation where I'll be worse off after a fight. If I'm not going to get any hospitalizing injuries, I really don't care.\n\nThe only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then, I'll do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them, I'd prefer to do that over killing them.\n\nI consider myself a feminist. I don't believe in enforced or uniform gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it'll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old Reddit \"women are crazy\" circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don't think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren't awesome.\n\nThat doesn't mean I look for places to victimize women, I just don't believe it's fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything's OK when it's really not (and that's a particularly harsh example, because all humans do that).\n\nI'm kind of tired of citing these examples and I'm guessing you're getting tired of reading them, if you've even made it this far. In closing, the people who know me in real life all respect me, as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community, where I spend most of my time and where I'm pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times, and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivational/inspirational quote was, and that comment was second to the top, so I guess other people agreed (though, granted, it was a pretty low-traffic post, only about a dozen competing comments).\n\nAnd, uh, I'm a pretty good moderator.\n\nAll that, and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish. So what do you think, now that you at least slightly know me?",

Whether you respect this culinary creation or not, if you\u2019ve been around r/food for long, I think you can agree with the following:\n\n>Our mod is a fucking bell end. The only pleasure they take from their position is the modicum of power their allowed, banning people left and right, drunk with authority, high on control.\n\n>My biggest gripe? The inability to engage them in conversation, no matter how peacefully, without being insulted - they truly are miserable and I pray everyday for a better mod.\n\n>If you agree with this sentiment, please upvote all the Waffle Pizzas you encounter.\n\n___\n\nEdit 3: Here are several of the now deleted threads that resulted from the so-called waffle pizza brigade.

I didn't see more things on the bigger screen, fights or dramatic scenes weren't more exciting or sad, I didn't feel like I was there any more than I felt that at home. The only advantages the theater has over watching it on any other medium is that usually it's released there first so I get to watch it sooner and the sound. And even that is arguable because so far the only time the sound has made a difference was with explosions and stuff because it literally sounded and felt like they tried to blow up my eardrums.

On the right we have an instagram addict who changes boyfriends like socks and makes you feel like she's too good for you and you don't deserve her.\n\nHmmmm, gimme more of that projection and bitterness. \n\n>Nah the one on the right keeps dropping \"subtle\" hints about kids, about marriage, and always seems to be sizing you up when there's a child around. You can never quite trust the contraceptives with the one on the right. Also the one on the right must be mentally deficient if she finds you attractive. This makes her less attractive.

We will work on our approach now that we have a mod team that is amenable to discussing political issues like this. I'm not sure if this needs to be said because the nature of this sub is anti capitalist, but we are not a pro-socdem sub.

I have agency and way more experience irl organising than the person who supposedly handling me like a puppet. The assertion itself flows from extremely patronizing, if not sexist attitudes many on the left unfortunately still foster around women in control - if we do something that might seem controversial, it must be because of men.\n\nResponse to this by MemeMeUpFamilia:\n\n>The story they are pushing is that they removed us because we were \"plotting a coup\" in a \"secret server\" and \"supported undemocratic honeypots\". I can tell you with absolute confidence this is a whole bunch of bogus. It's impossible for us to do a coup because none of us had the highest mod positions - which were femimarxi and happylittleclowds. We had a separate discord server made in late November to document and discuss toxicity because as shown by the google drive I linked, multiple efforts proved that it was impossible to confront or even discuss toxic mods on their hostile behavior.\n\n- [/r/communism post on the event](https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/alja2r/social_democrats_just_successfully_carried_out_a/)\n\n\nExpect more AOC and Bernie posts in there from now on. Looks very disappointing that they couldn't settle this through democratic means.\n\n\nUpdates to follow.\n\nEdit 1:\n\n- [Looks like Auraljuror bullied another LSC mod, Jeep in the discord for not liking Fallout 76.

Is instantly banned.](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/aljy7m/a_coup_has_just_taken_place_over_at/effizzg/)\n\n\n- [Once again, this raises discussion about moderation on reddit, and how one mod can have absolute power:](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/aljy7m/a_coup_has_just_taken_place_over_at/effesv4/)\n\n>Subreddits are completely hierarchical with absolute top-down power. Whoever holds the highest position \"owns\" the subreddit and can do whatever they want. From Reddit's perspective, there was no coup.\n\n>A subreddit is never run by its users or its modstaff, only by the top mod who can do whatever they want with it. Subs are automatically banned if they aren't moderated, further enforcing the hierarchical nature.\n\n>As the highest ranking active mod, Femimarxi has absolute power by Reddit's rules and can do whatever they please. The only way such power can be wrested from that person is if they go inactive and the sub's leadership is petitioned for to the admins. This means that if someone convinces the top mod to do something, that top mod can do it more or less without repercussions (barring ToS-breaking violations).\n\nEdit 4:\n\n- [One of the new mods responds in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/alo872/major_drama_in_rlatestagecapitalism_when_the_top/effplj2/)",

        "selftext": "I am not a fan and I didn't know about the pod until the conflict happen. The war was pretty much over when I found the subreddit. Which is good, no one from here  can comment. \n\nHere is what I was able to put together from the bones that were left. \n\nCall Her Daddy was a podcast made by 2 women, Sofia and Alex, who told stories of casual sex and regularly cheating on their boyfriends. They would later be picked up by Barstool, basically a sports network for frat boys and 40 year old bros.  After the Barstool contract tensions started to rise between the 2. \n\nAt some point Sofia started making plans to break the contract with Barstool to become independent instead of signing a new contract. Alex was with her at first  until the rooftop meeting. There wasn't any new episodes being posting. So fans knew something was up. \n\n[David Portnoy was the first to go public with the story.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiQTyZ_cNYY) Portnoy was able to poison the well. Most of the [non-Barstool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QldPLsPkGYA) r[elated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-UgsR-7aYQ)  p[odcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRJmIoC21g4) seem to side with Portnoy while also sympathizing with Sofia and Alex. [He was also able to divide Alex](https://www.reddit.com/r/CallHerDaddy/comments/gmxj30/sofia_speaks_video_attached/) and Sofia, after Sofia learned that Alex had slightly more power and made more money than her. [Alex would later go public on her side of the story.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgYqqSzkvgc) Both Portnoy and Alex decided to blame most of the problems on \"Suitman\" Sofia's boyfriend. I guess they were trying to give her room to return. \n\n\n\n\nEven somewhat before that [Barstool Sports](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yz8B6nwev9Y) was on the offensive. And even after Alex came back some at [Barstool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H259FD-tQX8) still didn't trust her.\n\n[Portnoy continue to attack Sofia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px5UwkyWAqQ) while she basically went radio silent. [Barstool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px5UwkyWAqQ) went after [Peter \"Suitman\" Nelson.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Uu73OpTk2U)\n\nSofia finally broke her silence with a podcast called 'Sofia with an F', [here is the basic run down of what she said.](https://youtu.be/RPpUTBD6zZw?t=753).\n\n___________________________________________\n\n**So that is the back story now we finally get to Reddit. The Call Her Daddy subreddit were basically on the girls side and then Alex's side. Alex would visit and make her one and only post there:**\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CallHerDaddy/comments/gpzwai/dear_daddy_gang_its_alex/\n\n**Most of the posts that were 5-7 months ago were Alex and Call Her Daddy positive and very negative towards Sofia:**\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CallHerDaddy/comments/gowukk/1_sentence_recap_of_the_trail/\n\n**Portnoy making Suitman the main villain worked. There were tons of post blaming Suitman on reddit and framing Sofia as naive:**\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CallHerDaddy/comments/gthaa1/the_fact_that_sofia_calls_him_suitman_tells_me/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CallHerDaddy/comments/gqbwkm/suitman_scooter_braun_biggest_douchebag_club_in/\n\n**The subreddit was extremely supportive of Alex:**\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CallHerDaddy/comments/gqx7nc/this_did_not_age_well/\n\n**But near the end of July the tide seemed to have turned. This is the first negative post I could find:**\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CallHerDaddy/comments/hsdpwq/everyone_who_still_enjoys_chd_has_to_be_max_16/\n\n**For the most part it seems like the subreddit has stayed together even as the opinion of who was right and who was wrong changed. So there wasn't a lot of in fighting. And like I said I am not a fan of the show. I am more of an amateur archeologist, and I am not a very good one at that. But it seems like the tide changed mostly because of the quality of the show, and Alex retaliating against the fanbase. As shown here:**\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CallHerDaddy/comments/idaujc/alex_hates_this_subreddit_but/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CallHerDaddy/comments/jaur3h/rip_chd_and_alexandra_cooper/\n\n**Some of the fans not liking her sense humor:**\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CallHerDaddy/comments/jse1hl/hey_alex_stop_joking_about_rape/\n\n**Someone pointed out that they should have saw this coming:**\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CallHerDaddy/comments/k9tw8v/stop_blaming_alex_unpopular_opinion/\n\n**Finally something happen, which I can't find the beginning of. But come October almost everyone on the CHD sub was excited for Sofia's return:**\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CallHerDaddy/comments/jc49r3/petition_to_let_sofia_release_11_minutes_that/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CallHerDaddy/comments/j6vhqp/sofia_is_back_with_us/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CallHerDaddy/comments/j73nmv/sofia_with_an_f/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CallHerDaddy/comments/ji7evm/welp_this_is_hella_trashy_and_doesnt_do_alexchd/\n\n**The CHD fans were raving about Sofia with an F podcast and of course shitting on what CHD has turned into:**\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CallHerDaddy/comments/johj4u/thank_god_we_broke_up_sofia_with_a_f/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CallHerDaddy/comments/jes56o/i_didnt_want_to_listen_to_sofia_with_an_f_but_i/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CallHerDaddy/comments/k7o9tm/dear_sofia_we_are_sorry_sincerely_everyone/\n\n**They even started realizing they were tricked into hating Suitman:**\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CallHerDaddy/comments/je2z1k/why_do_people_even_care_about_suitman/\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CallHerDaddy/comments/jx6hr3/how_do_you_feel_about_suitman_now/\n\n\n**Now Sofia has accidentally [inherited the CHD subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/CallHerDaddy/top/?sort=top&t=month) of 30k subs plus has her own [sub based on her podcast.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SofiawithanF/) And they are no where near close to forgiving [Alex](https://www.reddit.com/r/SofiawithanF/top/?sort=top&t=all) So basically Alex Portnoy and Barstool won the major battle. And for a lot of outsiders they won the war. But Sofia appears to be the real winner. With most of the reddit fanbase supporting her. Plus she is in a position to get significantly more of the profit going solo.**\n\nIf someone thinks they can do a better job showing what happen. Please do I am not very good at this.\n\n\n\n___________________________________________________\n\n\n[\"A lot of times when you look at these partnerships that are very successful.

            "I tried listening to CHD, but after three episodes (just Alex episodes, k ok me with Miley Cyrus) I realized that I could not relate at all to what she was saying. She says all these ideas like they are facts but that I think are some of my favourite things about being in a relationship. \n\nFor example, she was too embarrassed to use her bf toilet, so she purposely picked a fight (like all women do to get what they want....?????) and forced him to drive her home immediately. Once there, she couldn\u2019t use the only bathroom because her roommate was in there with her bf. So she shit in her backyard into a plastic bag while her neighbour watched her...... \n\nThe story was funny but what? As a woman, I do not understand, why:\n\n1. Purposely pick a fight with someone OVER NOTHING, instead of either using his toilet of lying about why you need to get home. Just use his bathroom, spray some poo-pourri and move on. \n\n2. You are home, you need to shit, it\u2019s an emergency, why would you not bang on the bathroom door and vaguely but sincerely explain the situation to the roommate. \n\n3. Your solution now is shitting in a bag, in full view of your neighbour???? \n\nNo. Just no.\n\nEdit: \n\nI couldn\u2019t spell the before you go toilet spray. \n\nAlso this is the first comment of mine that has ever gotten a significant amount of upvotes, and it\u2019s me weighing in on someone else\u2019s poop story.

I\u2019ve seen some shit being a college-aged girl and girls in their 20s do get involved in some crazy shit, but this podcast was just sooooo raunchy, insane, and obnoxious.

The four individuals are suspected of human trafficking, rape, and participation in an organized criminal group.

With four people in trouble, you increase the chances that one will narc on the others, or just plain screw up while being questioned.\n\nEDIT: Wikipedia now tacks on new troubles for them all: [Both Tate brothers are charged with human trafficking and forming an organized crime group. One of the four suspects is charged with rape, but was not named by police. Following the 24-hour detention, DIICOT asked a judge that the suspects be held for 30 more days. The court acceded to their request late on December 30, and all four are being remanded in custody for a further 30 days by police.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Tate#Legal_issues)\n\nIn the jug for 30 days! *That* don't look good.",

His brain, clearly incapable of thinking faster than the loading speed of the Soulja Boy game consoles, takes a ten hour hiatus.\n\n\n- Well after everyone thought he had slunk back to his cave, he responds again with a small video where he sits and eats pizza to basically say \"no u\", a manuver that clearly invested much of his brain power. So much, in fact, that he clearly didn't realize he'd proudly displayed a pizza box that could only exist in the one country he was hiding in with some uncertainty. \n\n\n- The Romanian police, after likely laughing all the way to their house, arrest the two morons.",

            "The one thing about game companies I will defend is the few women. As someone in the field, part of the problem is just so few applications coming from women. Though I am disappointed how few female artists there are in my branch since I feel like that department could have probably been more split, I am pretty sure there are more interested 3d artists that are woman than are represented so I don't know what's happening there but as far as programmers go, which is where most of the women in my branch actually are though the number is very small still, there just aren't that many women that even attended college for software development/computer science of any kind so what's in field is probably proportional to what's in the pool so while I do think more representation of women matters in all forms of software and not just game companies, the problem is more complicated than simply \"hire more women\". We also just need to start young and push more women into STEM by virtue of encouraging little girls to play with hobbies like robotics or those science lab toys and not just giving them baby toys, homemaking toys, and dolls. Not that there's anything wrong with those toys, but I think if we saw toys being less gendered and more little girls getting RC cars and more little boys getting dolls there would probably be a less severe gender gap in careers like STEM or nursing.",

Although I'd prefer to just go through one store, using another launcher and store isn't a big deal. It's no different to me than having multiple deposit/savings/investment accounts across several financial institutions. But it does suck for the original backers who were under the impression they'd get a Steam key. Things change and you should expect deviations in the final product (if it even ever gets released) when you back a Kickstarter but it would be best if the dev offers refunds to those who want it.",
            "I usually think people are being really dumb with epic, but this is honestly pretty shitty of the Shenmue team. They were saying it was on steam like last week lol\n\nThat said, the game looked kinda shit in the trailer, so idk",

            "Honestly, I can care less if games are on the Epic launcher or not, even if it is a bit more hassle.

Im going to buy Outer Worlds when it drops and im probably going to love it. Honestly in my opinion this has been a big deal deal for way too long, yea ofc game companies are going to sell their games on Epic's platform, they'll get more money for the game they worked on.

            "As much as the juice was as juicy as expected, this was also educational (the commenters, not spez obviously). I use Apollo because the Reddit app sucks and I hate browsing on my computer. So when people said \"Reddit is going to go to hell\" I was all \"yea, totally.\" But I gained a new perspective on how those that make Reddit the great place it is (mods, bot creators, third party devs, accessibility services, etc.- more groups than I ever realized) will be chased away. This will leave actual Reddit to manage all those things. Or more likely mismanage or not manage at all based on its history.\n\nReddit may be responsible for the framework of the site but free laborers almost *completely* manage day-to-day user experience. Reddit is a labor of love by so many people. And if those people don't love it, they won't do the labor, and Reddit goes to shit.\n\nPeople are referencing Twitter regarding the API change but I feel like Vine is also kind of a good example of this bad mentality. It underestimated the value of its top content creators and didn't adjust its model to fairly compensate them and keep them around. The top content creators all left and the app straight up died. The people providing services for Reddit aren't even asking for money, they're asking for a better volunteer experience! And regular users are only looking looking to third party apps and services because Reddit is failing to provide adequately. \n\nI'll definitely use Reddit less (at the very least) because the app is just worse. But I hate to think of the heart and soul of Reddit dying... that's a million times worse.\n\nMany thanks to the commenters on the AMA who truly made me understand (and appreciate) everything that goes into making this a wonderful place to be and thanks to all those that do all the work to make it happen.",

Reddit is being sterilised of anything that makes it reddit. Its character is being stripped piece by piece to appeal solely to the big suits on wall street. As the site goes public expect more of this to happen. What happened to Youtube should be a close mirroring of what happened to reddit. More ridiculous rules and guidelines aimed at making this site child friendly will follow. Just like YouTube has slowly pruned the soul of itself until the only content will be stuff already being pushed by legacy media and soulless, bland content appealing to the lowest common dominater. \n\nWhat happened to a lot of the hippies in the 60s I think, closely resembles what happened to these sites. Many of the hippie generation by the time they reached their 40s became the soulless corporate executives they once loathed. Trailblazers of the early Internet era have sold out or have died.

It's basically about a world in which superheroes are real, but are also (almost) all colossal dicks; the titular Boys are a group of sort-of vigilantes who are determined to punish them, with varying motivations.\n\nIt had long been thought that the series would be difficult to faithfully adapt, as it contains some mercilessly profane content that's beyond the pale even in an age of \"gritty\" takes on the genre (though it's far from the most fucked up thing Ennis has ever written - that would be *Crossed*). Still, the general consensus is that Amazon has captured the spirit of the comic while toning down many of its excesses.\n\n**Currently**\n\nWith the first season having dropped last week, /r/Television has seen numerous submissions praising the show.

            "so i have not seen the show past like half of episode 1 but what's weird to me is that i have seen a lot of summaries call the boys \"vigilantes\" and \"regular people\", when, at least in the comics, they are a cia-funded black ops units who all take the drug that gives most people their super powers to become harder, better, faster, stronger.",
            "I saw all the posts about this show and thought it looked dumb. But that was before I knew Karl Urban was in it",

            "Ive been getting cringy ads for that show in my reddit feed for months and its turned me off from ever wanting to watch it. There was one that said something like \"f*ck superheroes. They're a**holes.\" Complete with the censored asterisks and everything",

            "I don't know why anyone on this site would assume that corporate shills are everywhere on Reddit; it seems kind of paranoid. And anyway, this show looks like a lot of fun! \n\nAnd speaking of fun, the 2020 Kia Soul EV is being launched this autumn with improved range, a revolutionary anti-lock braking system and improved suspension for your on-the-go party needs! With so many colors to choose from, *my* hardest decision this year will be deciding between lime green and autumn sunrise.\n\n(I'm kidding. Unless Kia sends me a check, in which case, no I'm not.)",
            "My problem with the show is that it is allegedly subverting the tropes of the superhero genre by casting heroes as moralless corporate villains - but it aggressively follows every other trope of contemporary TV dramas.\n\nHonest to God, there's a scene where the lead dude and a superhero have a heart to heart conversation, just because they both happened to be sitting on the same park bench. Like the hero is just having an incredibly personal & revealing phone call, and the lead of the story is coincidentally two feet away - ready for emotional support. It's laughable.\n\nIt's also pretty visually flat, and feels extremely dated as a social satire. The analogues to Bush era foreign policy are laid on thick, and just having a Justice League riff in general makes it feel AGGRESSIVELY mid-2000s.\n\nThe show isn't terrible, and I'll probably finish it out for the sake of the discourse. But I'm just aggressively unimpressed, based on how hype Reddit has gotten on it.",
            ">I think it's very creative to see this realistic spin on the comic book heroes. Sorry If I am not a Comic afficianado and Ihave no idea who the F Garth pennis is.\n\nHe wants to see a \"realistic\" spin on comic book heroes, but hasn't actually read enough comics to know who Ennis is... \n\nThis dude is exactly the type of person that deserves the mockery he's getting.",

            "My wife likes the show but I don't care for it.\n\nLife has been an all-around shitshow the past few years, and people are being profoundly terrible. I like stories that let me escape from this persistent awfulness. A show all about *\"If those fantasy heroes were real they'd just be part of the problem\"* isn't anything I want right now.",
            "Is this what's appearing in the new Slipknot single, then? I saw the video for that when it came out last week and every time they cut from the band's headline slot at last month's Download Festival to extreme violence and shots of Karl Urban looking pissed, I kept wondering where the latter was coming from.",

The first one was also pretty good from a storytelling perspective if you don't mind tropes. But tbh the obviousness of \"Jaded, cold dude has to take care of precocious standoffish child. Gee wonder if the child will make him develop a soft spot?\" Was just a lil bit too much. But it had enough cute moments to make up for it.

They think they're some sort of genius at telling what a good game is and what they forget is, because they're actually as stupid as frog, is games are not a definitive thing. You can not say \"everyone has to like this because of x y and z\" YOU like it because of x y z. But x y z may not the same to the next person. It is all opinion and your opinion is not the sole truth of what everyone must think. If someone likes it who gives a rats ass? It doesn't do ANY thing to your life so wtf does it matter?

But you go to a mirror and come to find out, you're the opposite sex of what you chose, so you made what your character feels like they really are. Then the whole objective of the game is finding a doctor that can perform the surgery and give you the treatment to allow you to become what you feel like you really are, all while dodging and sneaking around the zombie apocalypse. They should also put an unskippable sex scene and since everyone is trans, it's \"TRANS SEX!!!1!!1\" Every time a new objective starts. You have to go to a location that gives you your objective so you find clues about the doctors location and it's the area where people in the group go for \"alone time\" and everytime you go in there theres people in there doin the dirty. \nThe only people in the game that aren't trans are the ones where you have to go to get supplies from and its always a guess of it they allow you to buy things from them, they can deny you service for being trans. \"But you aren't trans yet, you need to see the doctor to start transitioning\" through out the game you need to get health. They only way to get health is by finding, what you assume is painkillers, but it isn't, its hormonal replacement pills, so the whole game youre actually trans as well just going to the doctor to get the surgery.",

There\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong to identify or fix, but the depression is still there and the only thing that keeps it at bay is daily antidepressants. Having lived through multiple experiences where my meds lost their efficacy while nothing else changed, I definitely feel the difference between when they\u2019re working and when they\u2019re not. \n\nThat being said, the linked drama might be over a misunderstanding- most people who experience depression don\u2019t have a chronic case, so in that regard the OP is right when they say they don\u2019t need SSRIs for the rest of their lives, but that other 15% that isn\u2019t successfully treated does. \n\nOr I could be giving them too much credit.",

You\u2019re wrong. \u201cAlso, researchers don't know whether the dip in serotonin causes the depression, or the depression causes serotonin levels to drop\u201d. God, I hate the internet.\n\nAs if that makes any difference. Whatever the cause is, chronic depression is real lmao\n\nAlso, I don't understand how people can believe how some people can be born blind, or with a third leg or whatever, but when it comes to the brain it always somehow comes out perfect with nothing out of the ordinary and no deficiencies. Like, holy fuuuuuuck, it's not even a stretch.",
            ">It\u2019s not a Prozac deficiency, it\u2019s serotonin. You sound like a brand new nurse who has zero idea what they don\u2019t know.\n\nThe serotonin deficiency hypothesis is pretty poorly supported and many (and more and more) researchers are dropping it for other theories. More recent evidence suggests that they have some downstream effect that isn't understood.\n\nFor example if you start taking SSRIs your serotonin levels change within about 40 minutes of starting treatment, but there's no change in levels of depression until the patient has been on them for 2-6 weeks. This simply doesn't add up as the brain has usually created a tolerance by that point and the effective levels are usually back to where they were previously. But sometimes the levels have actually decreased, and other times they've increased, but despite which way it has gone they have still been effective at reducing depression.\n\nEven more evidence for this is that mice have been genetically modified so that they don't even have the serotonin receptors required. But the drugs still work in those mice (although slightly less effectively, but that could be for a variety of reasons, including the serotonin having some minor benefit).\n\nOr another reason is that the serotonin = happiness trope isn't really true. Serotonin is *vastly* more complex than that, increased levels of serotonin can even make you upset or depressed. Even with drugs like MDMA, in controlled environments it doesn't always even lead to euphoria, and can even lead to dysphoria. Serotonin is used in all sorts of areas, from short term memory, to sensory processing, to emotional state. It's kind of like punching a driver in the face while being in the passenger seat of a car, then concluding that the vehicles speed is determined by how hard you punch the driver. Yes it is controlled by the driver, but in a very complex way.\n\nBut dat_user is absolutely wrong. Even though these drugs are very poorly understood, and most people with depression probably don't have anything similar to a \"serotonin deficiency\", they still absolutely work for many people. I don't think they should be the first line of treatment, but second or third, absolutely, because they do work, even if the effect is somewhat minor for most people.",

            "It should be noted that I've upvoted every single person who's disagreed with me here, as far as I know.\n\nThat said.\n\nIn 7th grade, I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn't do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area.\n\nAn IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test.\n\nMy mother's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but I've met lots of other engineers who aren't as good as me at physics, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it.\n\nI'm also pretty good at engineering. I don't have a degree, and other than physics I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan).\n\nI have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I've come across. Every question of existentialism which I've seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven't been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I've considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is.\n\nPsychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there's no aspect of psychology which I don't have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud's theories.\n\nI'm a good enough writer that I'm writing a book and so far everybody who's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that's not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I've heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it.\n\nI don't know if that will suffice as evidence that I'm intelligent. I'm done with it, though, because I'd rather defend my maturity, since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code.\n\nI believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it, I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them.\n\nI don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I don't have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don't care what a person's fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don't have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things.\n\nI love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for *everyone*.\n\nI'm pretty much a pacifist. I've taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I'll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don't attack, I'll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don't fight back. I've therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious, because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that I'm never in a situation where I'll be worse off after a fight. If I'm not going to get any hospitalizing injuries, I really don't care.\n\nThe only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then, I'll do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them, I'd prefer to do that over killing them.\n\nI consider myself a feminist. I don't believe in enforced or uniform gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it'll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old Reddit \"women are crazy\" circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don't think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren't awesome.\n\nThat doesn't mean I look for places to victimize women, I just don't believe it's fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything's OK when it's really not (and that's a particularly harsh example, because *all humans* do that).\n\nI'm kind of tired of citing these examples and I'm guessing you're getting tired of reading them, if you've even made it this far. In closing, the people who know me in real life all respect me, as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community, where I spend most of my time and where I'm pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times, and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivational/inspirational quote was, and that comment was second to the top, so I guess other people agreed (though, granted, it was a pretty low-traffic post, only about a dozen competing comments).\n\nAnd, uh, I'm a pretty good moderator.\n\nAll that, and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish. So what do you think, now that you at least slightly know me?",

            "You are missing an interesting aspect of this story! Before he made the \"this guy is a Trump supporter\" comment, he had a comment where he said \"Unsurprisingly, this guy was an undocumented immigrant\". He also included the same exact Fox news link for both comments that didn't support his claims. It seems the mod was trying to bait people on both sides of the political spectrum. I was commenting trying to point out what he was doing so people wouldn't fall for the bait. He even replied to one of my comments saying something along the lines of \"politics reels people in, this sub went from 4k people viewing to 10k since I made these comments.\" His comment is marked controversial so that means he's had a relatively similar amount of upvotes and downvotes so I guess his divisiveness is working :| I ended up here because all of the comments I made about what this guy was doing were deleted from my profile and I went to investigate and found the sub was private and immediately came here. Normally when a comment is deleted it stays on your profile and you won't even know it's gone unless they message you about it, (unless you copy and paste the singles comment link to your comment into a browser you're not logged in on) so I thought this was pretty odd and went to find out what happened\n\nEdit: now my comments are back lol, the subreddit is restored and back to normal and his Trump comment is still there",

The people that worked there were always knowledgeable, helpful, polite, and went the extra mile to get you what you were looking for.\n\nThe staff in the '90s had become young kids for the most part, and when they were given their new name badges, the change in attitude was palpable. All of a sudden they thought they were actually in the music business. They turned into the biggest bunch of arrogant little douches. They talked to customers like they barely had time for them, criticized and bashed people's purchases at checkout or when asked about were an artist was in the store.\n\nIt got so bad it became a common point of conversation in the Bay Area music crowd. And almost always, the laminate thing came-up as ground zero. There are certainly some other dynamics that played a part. The badges weren't cursed by a wizard. But it was cringe city watching these boys and girls constantly fiddling with them when they talked to customers, tossing them over their shoulder to get them out of their way. Constantly doing whatever they could to bring attention to it.\n\nTower was a great chain. I loved going to their stores and spending a couple of hours looking for stuff. Tower is a prime example of the employees alone, destroying a large successful chain.

        "selftext": "# **DISCLAIMER: MAKE SURE YOU READ THE EDITS BEFORE MAKING AN OPINION ON THIS.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n****\n\nIf you missed yesterday's drama, where a SimDemocracy (hereby referred to as SimDem) government official attempted to [bribe a user into joining their party by offering them a government position](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/dajbb6/fungate_corruption_scandal_in_rsimdemocracy_user/), imagine that, but 1 million times worse.\n\nFor the unaware, /r/SimDemocracy is a subreddit about emulating democracy on Reddit. Rules are voted on, moderators are elected, there's a fully fledged system of government with parties and everything. The president is an elected official as well, acting as the primary executive body of the government, and the newest one has already had their own share of controversy. But today, it's hit its peak.\n\n[A post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SimDemocracy/comments/dav2jm/the_president_casually_offering_roles_to_an/) was created today on the SimDem subreddit, where the OP showed screenshots of what appeared to be the subreddit President, /u/ToadsWildRide68, offering Discord roles to a 15 year old in exchange for... Well, nudes. I don't think it needs to be said how utterly ***fucked up*** that is.\n\nThe sub has naturally imploded as a result. The front page has been filled with posts calling for /u/ToadsWildRide68 (hereby to be referred to as Toad) to be banned and impeached. Another moderator, /u/mewbie23 (who holds the office of Vice President), quickly obliged, removing Toad and banning them from the subreddit. Along with the storm occurring in the subreddit, there is an absolutely enormous amount of drama happening in the sub Discord. \n\nIn the short time since this was all brought to light, there have already been an influx of [memes](https://www.reddit.com/r/SimDemocracy/comments/davykz/recent_few_days_summarized/) ([lots of memes](https://www.reddit.com/r/SimDemocracy/comments/daw8je/toads_bad/)) and anger amongst users. Along with this all was a healthy dose of skepticism; many pointing out that it is possible that the screenshots were doctored. While there has been no conclusion made on the matter as of yet, users are working to contact the Discord administrators to confirm this, as well as getting video of the conversation.\n\nAs of writing this Toad has not yet responded to the drama, and both his Reddit account and Discord account are not suspended. I will update if anything changes.\n\n\n***EDIT 1***: Be advised that there are currently murmurings of this potentially being faked. While there is little evidence either way, it is a possibility. Anyone who attempts to harass Toad and/or find out personal information will be reported directly to the admins and banned, regardless of whether this is shown to be fake or not.\n\n***EDIT 2: THE PLOT THICKENS:*** It turns out that the server invite mentioned in the DM was [made by user /u/trunksplays just before the alleged DM was made!](https://www.reddit.com/r/SimDemocracy/comments/daxw8w/hmmmmm/) Depending on the timezone, it could have been mere minutes before. This is extremely suspicious. While the jury is not yet out entirely, it is looking more and more likely that this could potentially all be falsified. We'll have to just wait and see.\n\n***EDIT 3:*** After much petty bickering and mob mentality in the SimDem Discord, along with a healthy dose of uninformed Reddit detective-ness, the community has collectively jumped the fence yet again and decided that **this has been faked.** While there is no definitive evidence either way still, there are many more signs pointing towards it being fake now; there is still more to be found out though, from both the creator of the suspicious invite and Toad himself, neither of which have made any formal statements on the matter.\n\n**EDIT 4: \"WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON SEND HELP\" EDITION:** So shit has hit the fan completely. After carefully analyzing the pixels of the screenshot and deciding that they looked weird, the collective SimDem hivemind decided that, *gasp*, toad had been **framed!** It has now become a whodunnit of the most idiotic proportions. The main discussion has turned into a massive freakout about a potential conspiracy involving numerous users and ***double framing***. Yes, apparently someone framed someone by making it look like *they* framed someone else. According to the top sleuths at SimDem, at least. Who was this mysterious person that framed /u/trunksplays? Why did this heinous crime occur? Is there a single person in this goddamn server who's over the age of 18? While I have my suspicions for all of these, I have been unable to find any answers. Perhaps our Top Minds have figured it out though, or have made substantial progress in uncovering this ever-growing conspiracy of the highest proportions. I hope not because I have no fucking clue what's going on, I left the chat for 10 fucking minutes to take a shower (yes, /r/SubredditDrama mods sometimes shower, believe it or not) and when I came back there'd been a whole extra layer of conspiracy added and I have completely lost track of what's happening.\n\n**EDIT 5: \"STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING\" EDITION:** So one of our brave Reddetectives has made [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/560948103662927872/627950043487535134/unknown.png) document outlining the situation. We're getting to levels of plot complexity that Game of Thrones only wished it could have had. \n\n**EDIT 6: A NEW CHALLENGER APPROACHES:** Our brave keyboard warriors have come to a shocking discovery. An outside force, pulling the strings behind this whole operation. Or that's what they've landed on for now at least. Enter **the Wolfsengels**. What are the Wolfsengels, you may ask? They are a group of vigilante keyboard warriors, fighting under the banner of stopping pedophilia on this website. A fine goal amongst honorable men, you may think? Well think again. The Wolfsengels are but a vigilante group masquerading as honorable men. They take these democratic subreddits, these glorious beacons of Reddit ingenuity and stupidity, and tear them down through manipulation and deceit. The very thought sickens me. They have done this to numerous other Simulation subreddits, if my anonymous source is to believed. But who can you trust these days?\n\nNow I'm sure that you, an intelligent redditor as you are, is wondering to yourself, \"where's the connection? Why does any of this matter? [When can I just go ruin someone's life already?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4twYqvssu0)\" Let me explain. Remember /u/trunksplays? They were a fairly major character a few seasons ago, though with as many twists and turns we've had you could be forgiven for forgetting about them. They created the invite that was allegedly sent by Toad, only hours before the DMs were made. Well they were involved in this Wolfsengel group. And our brave democratic teens have made a stunning observation; the invite was only valid for an hour. In that hour of the invite being valid, the leader of the Wolfsengels joined the server. This is *clear evidence* that this mysterious group is involved. Additionally, the person who these DMs were allegedly sent to has talked extensively about this group as well. But what does it all mean? Who really is this alleged recipient of the send nudes DM? And more importantly, *what the fuck is happening?* \n\n**EDIT 7: IF THIS WERE A TV SHOW IT'D FUCKING BOMB:** The investigation moves into its seventh hour (yes, this has been going on non stop for 7. Fucking. Hours. Send help.) And as it goes on the mystery gets deeper and deeper. Contact has been made with the recipient of the DMs. Sophie, as the username suggests they are called, has conversed with a SimDem member, in a quest to figure out the facts. **[Here is that conversation.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/627958752380846080/627964007457882112/YOo_wtf.png)** I will let you read it yourself, because I lost track of what's happened about 4 hours ago. The main thing to take away from this all, though, is that claims of Toad's guilt have been reinforced. The SimDem community is preparing to jump the fence once more. And as they stand, ready to take the leap over, they think to themselves about what they are doing. \"How could this be resolved?\" they think. There are only 2 options, to contact the Discord administrators to get verifiable proof that this is happening, or to go on a classic Reddit investigation on something entirely out of their realm of expertise. They appear to be going with the latter, **like any self respecting Redditor should**. As of typing this, speech analysis is being done, along with writing analysis. Will our heroes come to the conclusion that they \"look similar\"? Will they come to ***any conclusion ever?*** We can only sit back and find out.\n\n***EDIT 8: \"WALT FUCKING DISNEY\" EDITION:*** The fence has been jumped once more, as a shocking new discovery was made! Toad has claimed to be 14. His flair on /r/Teenagers has been 14 now for a while. All evidence has pointed towards him, in fact, being 14. ***HOWEVER!!!*** There has been a bombshell dropped upon the laps of our brave explorers. [THIS.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/560948103662927872/627971514381238273/image1.jpg) In this comment, Toad is referring to a Disneyland ride that *closed in 2002!* If he was 14, as he said, this ride would have closed before he was born. Another bombshell: [This](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/560948103662927872/627971877482004545/image0.png). Note the flair, Riverfront Park Restorer. He's allegedly part of the Spokane Redevelopment Division. You have to be over 18 to work for it! Does this mean that Toad is an adult lying about being a child? Has he been lying about this for months? Why? More questions, fewer answers. What's different about this saga? Will we ever reach a conclusion? Will our democratic friends ever realize that they can just contact the Discord admins to verify that the conversation took place? I'll keep you updated ~~please let it end i just want to fucking sleep~~.\n \n***EDIT 9: \"I CAN FINALLY SLUMBER\" EDITION***: The conversation has winded down for the night. Our brave heroes get prepared for another day of school tomorrow. None of them have done their math homework. We may never know if they can factorize quadratic equations or not.\n\n***EDIT 10: NEVER MIND NO SLEEP FOR ME I SUPPOSE:*** So there's apparently been something else that's dropped. Our courageous lynch mob have once again jumped the fence and decided that Toad is innocent. Again. I hope someone's been keeping a tally because I've lost fucking count. These 3 screenshots were released: [1](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/560948103662927872/627978535365115924/image0.jpg) [2](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/560948103662927872/627978546484215808/image0.jpg) [3](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/560948103662927872/627978555610890280/image0.jpg). What do they mean? ...No seriously what do they mean, I have no clue what's going on anymore. From what I can gather, this someone involved in faking the screenshots saying that they saw the screenshots being faked. Now seeing as SimDem can't detach themselves for even a second from their beloved roleplay democracy, they have censored out the usernames involved in accordance with some law they have. So we only have the word of the poster of these screenshots, who is fortunately a high ranking and trusted member of SimDem. Which, as we have gathered in this behemoth of a post, is worth precisely fucking nothing. More updates to come because of course there are. Have I made it obvious enough that this shit is tiresome and stupid? Because if not, ***this shit is tiresome and stupid***.\n\n*****\n\n\n***EDIT 11: THE END...?:*** It's happened. The masterminds of SimDem have yet again, jumped the fence. Now, this is no news at this point. It's about as predictable as Sean Bean's character dying, or the Pope helping to cover up for a pedophile priest. But this may be the **last time**. Because now there's **solid evidence** that it's been ***FAKED!*** Yes, put down the pitchforks, readers, it's true. All that other evidence that was solid and believed by everyone until it was disproven? Yeah just pretend that never happened, because this is totally the last time guys I swear.\n\nRemember Sophie? The mysterious account who was allegedly the victim of this horrendous action from our questionably aged suspect? Well in further talks, they admitted that they were, in fact, from *Norway*. Why does this matter, you may ask? Time zones. Our noble investigators were able to determine the exact time of the messages being sent. She took the screenshots showing the time of those texts. And there was one discrepancy that they didn't notice in these; *the invite that was allegedly sent was created* ***AFTER*** the texts happened!* There is no possible way that the invite could have been sent, because it didn't exist at the alleged time of the texts.\n\nIn a shocking turn of events, the users of SimDem, laying down their mob mentality driven ways after this long investigation, have decided once and for all that u/Toadswildride68 is ***innocent***. There are still questions to be answered: Who orchestrated this? Why? Simdem may never know, and neither will we. However, these are stories for another time. This has been our Avengers Endgame. Though Marvel couldn't even dream of a plot this absurdly complex.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA lot has been learned in these past few hours. This saga will doubtless be studied in classrooms access the world in years to come. From the mob mentality that drove these users to nearly doxxing this victim, to the reactions after collectively deciding he was innocent for the 10th time, to the brave meme warriors, out on the front lines of r/simdemocracy, fighting for something they believed was right; and to the extreme lack of responsibility and maturity shown in these actions that this group of teenagers took, for despite acknowledging themselves numerous times that they should leave it for discord admins to verify (which they don't appear to have done yet), they continued on this blind warpath, fueled by nothing but an easily faked screenshot and a few people saying that \"it's definitely real\". \n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn my own personal opinion, this situation acts as a near perfect allegory for the dangerous mob mentality behind Reddit. Spurred on by little more than a vague assertions they attempted to go above and beyond in an misguided investigation into frontiers that they had no experience in, all while asserting to themselves that they were doing the right thing. And everyone got caught up in it. Every person involved. Even I was somewhat involved initially. In a way, we are just like the users of r/Simdemocracy: Desperate for any resolution, no matter how ill concieved, despite there being a clear path to the answer. And even after its settled, those involved will learn next to nothing from it, for the next time something like this happens.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*****\n\n**If you're interested in a democracy simulation subreddit that isn't completely fucking imploding, feel free to check out /r/DemocracyExperiment.**",

For what it's worth, it looks like it wasn't r/ROI doing that but rather adjacent subs (like r/IrelandProtest afaik) that have a large overlap of users.\n\nr/Ireland's always been tricky to moderate, it only had 4-5 mods if that up to around 150k subscribers and it worked fine, it was only astroturfing yanks coming in to spread bigotry that forced them to get new mods.

            "Oh em eff gee.  This is so many degrees of fucked up, I don't even know where to begin.  As a victim of severe long-term abuse as a child, this was hard to read.  I won't minimize or discount that abuse is abuse regardless of how bad or serious it was.  If it was real, it has an impact.  But I don't know about this girl.  She just doesn't come across as a victim at all. She comes off as an entitled teenager who has had everything she wants in life.  Generally, the abused tend to be humble and private about their experiences.  Knowing how it feels, they aren't prone to compete with others over who had it worse and they don't generally want people to fawn all over them or let their abuse define them.  Even more, the last thing they want to do is minimize or discount someone else's abuse.   She really, really wants to be a victim.  After abuse, most victims don't want to be a victim anymore.  We don't want special treatment, we don't want pity, we don't want anyone walking on eggshells.  We just want to be fucking normal and get on with what life we have left.  It seems like she thinks that gets some kind privilege or immunity because of her suffering.  I'm only one of millions, but I'm gonna tell you, being abused often makes you feel small and worthless and undeserving of love, friendship and a plethora of other things.   \n\nFor the sake of this poor girl, I really hope she wasn't abused and is just a naive teenager that misunderstands literally everything about life & relationships.  \n\nHonestly, it really sucks and kind of hurts to question or criticize someone claiming abuse.  I'm really not that person, but nothing here adds up at all.  ",

            "I agree, this girl is a total asshole. But if we\u2019re taking this post at face value, I do want to point out that this is an abused child who is probably severely mentally affected by the abuse and many children parrot the abusive person\u2018s behavior as the way to regain some control in their lives. I\u2019m betting her father does exactly the same types of things to her. It\u2019s part of the reason a lot of abused children go on to abuse their own children. They don\u2019t know differently and to them if it\u2019s normal than they need to behave that way with their children as well. Think of all of the sexually abused children who go onto sexually abuse other children. It seems normal to them so they behave the same way, even if they are told by society that it is wrong. Abusers are fantastic at making their victims feel that not only are they at fault, but it really is a normal thing that is just not recognized as such by an uptight public. \n\nThis girl definitely needs to be removed from that home and given intensive mental health treatment. She may still always be an asshole, but she may be a little more of a functioning asshole than she is now.\n\nNot at all defending her behavior, just wanted to point out all of the terrible things abuse can do to a person.",

That's really the most basic conclusion here. \n\nLook at it this way: The girlfriend would be legally considered the mom, until the friend has a partner willing to adopt the child (not mentioned so might be a no), and unless they go through a clinic. I doubt they are going through a clinic, sounds like they were doing it \"naturally\" which is actually not smart and there's a number of legal advice posts around that explain why. \n\nIn any case, so, she's legally on the hook for all responsibilities of parenthood and child support. If the OP decides to continue the relationship with her, and if the relationship progressed naturally, he could end up the step dad to the child and end up taking on responsibilities, and he isn't interested in that. And that's without getting into what if the friend bails because parenting is hard, or something else happens to the friend, and the gf and OP are left holding the bag?\n\nSo breaking up with her, rather than taking on the responsibility he doesn't want and which isn't really his to begin with, is the only option he has if he doesn't want to become entangled.\n\nThe problem with the arguments in the thread is that a lot of them are relying heavily on analogy, and they're running into the problem where if you take one situation, and change some aspects of it, it becomes a completely different and not very comparable situation.",
            "I immediately though what an asshole for not supporting her but the more arguments stating he wasn\u2019t made me open my eyes a bit more and ignore my knee jerk reaction.\n\nSome of the points were pregnancy can be dangerous, women do still have serious complications even with proper care and doctors \n\nHis life would also be on hold to some degree to allow her to do this. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine how it would feel to have the person you love go through a pregnancy and then hand the baby over.  I get this is VERY common however it impacts every individual differently which leads to my next point.\n\nPostpartum depression is very real and very common.  This (along with the pregnancy in general) could absolutely strain the relationship.\n\nYes it\u2019s her body but they are in a relationship together and should make these decisions together.  He was honest and told her he doesn\u2019t think he can do that, I don\u2019t see anything wrong with his stance.  Much better than going along with it and a few months in leaving her pregnant, hormonal and emotional. ",

The decision to be a surrogate is one that should weigh the opinion of your significant other and while he cannot make her do anything, it is not unreasonable for him to object to it. This isn't him walking out on a girl he knocked up and abandoning his own kid, this is him knowing the physical and emotional toll a pregnancy takes on both the woman and the man in a relationship and he is saying \"That's not what I'm looking for in a relationship.\"",

All the men said that they wouldn't like to go through another pregnancy if the kid isnt going to be theirs. And YES i said another pregnancy as if its the mans pregnancy too, because thats how it is supposed to be when the woman is pregnant, and if you don't trust me, just read the comments on the actual post where people will say the exact same thing. \n\nOFC he is in the right, from what he says in the post his gf mentioned that she was thinking about becoming a surrogate, and not ask him about what he thought about it.

I would hope that a loving relationship would at least try to delve a little deeper into why she wants to do it, what possibilities exist to alleviate his concerns, etc. Outside of cheating I don't think one person should put their foot down that hard that early.\n\nAnd maybe they did talk all of that through but OP never mentioned it further in the thread.",

            "It will depend on how it's presented.  A guy shouting and demanding his girlfriend not to do this or that is a jerk and will definitely be perceived as trying to control her.\n\nA guy who talks it out with his girlfriend, let's her know what and how he feels but still let's her decide (especially all in a calm manner) is a gentleman (or at least mature).\n\nIf you are against it, set your standards accordingly. If you can convince her in a calm manner where she comes to the conclusion on her own, she will no longer think of it (imagine the difference between someone trying you tell you what to do against your desires vs you being internally motivated to do that same thing).\n\nThe next thing that needs to be considered is the content and full knowledge of it.  Does she understand what pregnancy is like?  Had she considered the mental challenges she will have to go through?  Can she \"give up\" that child to someone else?  Is she financially able to support herself during the pregnancy?  \n\nNow, there will be some people who will argue that if you truly love her, you'll support her no matter what.  While that's great and all, a successful relationship requires both sides to work thing out together and consider the effects of major decisions in the overall relationship and how each person feels about it.  \n\nA successful relationship is one where the rules/roles could be flipped and both of you are fine with it.  If the situation was flipped where you're wanting to give a surrogate kid for a female lesbian friend for the same reason her gay friends have, would she be fine with it?  If so and it still conflicts with your values, it's time to reassess your relationship.  \n\nBut first and foremost, make sure you understand why she wants to do it, then check to see if she really understands what it means from multiple angles.  It's very easy to be emotionally swayed and focused with biased thoughts.  \n\nRather than force the information on her, have her do her research on what other people say about it, what advise others give, warnings and heads-ups to be aware of, and what-not so that if she does go through with this, she'll be fully prepared whether you're there for her or not.  At least it will make you look good.  You love her, and if she's going to still go through with this, you want to make sure everything is accounted for so she experiences the least amount of issues relating to surrogacy, even when you're gone.\n\nThen once she does that, calmly express your concerns, what you're worried about, and how you feel.  If she still brushes you off and wants to go through with it and it really bothers you, then this is NOT going to be a good future and you're not going to look at her the same way.  \n\nOne thing though: do NOT use your relationship with her as leverage to try to get her to change her mind!  If she sticks with you because you \"threatened\"* to end things with her (instead of because she now understands why being a surrogate mother is a bad idea), she will resent the relationship and it will fall apart in the future because it held her back from doing something she really wants to do  (*Threatened is quoted since that's how she'll perceive it).\n\nGood luck man.

            "I mean obviously it is up to her in the end, but considering that they are in a relationship he has the right to not be okay with it. That being said, this seems like it should be a conversation between him, his girlfriend, and her friend. I have to say though that threatening to break up with her is definitely shitty, because that is not a good way and healthy to get your point across, it just puts your partner in a uncomfortable situation where they feel forced.\n\nSo I definitely get his feelings, but he might still be kinda of an asshole depending on how he communicated those feelings. Because if you don't come to an understanding with your partner, and they only do the thing you wanted because you gave them an ultimatum, then that is just gonna damage your relationship. \n\nEdit: Why the downvotes? Threatening to break up with your partner is not good communication ",
            "I'm surprised that anyone would be specifically upset about the \"with another man's baby\" part. Unless if they mean in regard to being able to keep the baby afterwards, that is some serious insecurity. I also don't understand how anyone could think OP was in the wrong, he clearly stated that he didn't have any desire to control what his gf does, so what's the issue?\n\nI'm child free, and although the reason for that is 90% not wanting anything to do with kids, not wanting anything to do with pregnancy is also a major part of it. For me it would just put an enormous strain on my life to have a gf who can't do anything enjoyable, whom I can't find attractive, and who is dealing with emotional and physical stress for 9 months. You can't pretend that certain personal choices don't have significant relevance to your partner, even though you are entirely free to make those choices. Although pregnancy is very obviously far worse for the woman experiencing it than anyone else, it still sounds like an absolute nightmare for their partner too.",

            "[deleted]",
            "Personally, what I find at least bothersome here is how quickly someone is willing to drop a person they care about due to their health.  I think there is a degree of so-called fair-weather friendship here. I have some chronic health issues that can make my functioning levels hard for me to predict, and it has really hurt to have friends fade because I can't consistently make it to every social function. I thought they liked me for me, not just having another body around. When I get close to someone, I am taking into account that difficult things will happen to them, and they will eventually need the support of another human, and so will I. So, I feel like my threshold for saying, \"Hey, this is hard, and you need very frequent support, but because you're not trying to hurt me in any way, I still like you, and being there for each other is what friends and family connections are for in the first place, so I'm not going to drop you over this\" is much lower compared to other people. Maybe it is because my whole life, I grew up around pregnant relatives, but it's less than a year, to me it is not worth throwing away a relationship with someone you love and see a future with. I guess the OP of that post also had some other issues with that relationship, because I find it a little hard to believe he would end something he really cared about over a temporary health situation.\n\nEdit: Does anyone think this is kind of similar to being in a relationship with someone in the military? Their motivations are similar - they tend to see it as a choice they make for the greater good that they themselves may not directly benefit from. I think the similarities pretty much end there, but in some circles it would be very unpopular to say that someone is being selfish in their relationship specifically if they join the military. Ideologically, I am of a totally different opinion about the military, but that is not the topic here, so please do not get confused and bring up the question of whether anyone should join the military, or something. I'm talking about the motivations being similar, and whether anyone thinks any of that carries over. You know, asking questions and trying to keep my judgement mild, which seems to be a big problem for some people."

            "Fuck's sake, it's a vaccine, not a sci-fi energy shield. I don't want to say people are stupid if they think vaccines are always 100% effective, that's probably too much, but they are certainly wrong.",

            "I think there are important things to remember when seeing shit like this; 1) what is 100% effective? Are condoms? Nope. Bullet proof vests? Not if youre using hollow tips or get shot in the head? Does wearing seatbelts stop accidents? We still have AIDS, the common cold, STD\u2019s so it\u2019s not like we can snap our fingers and magically make any virus disappear. Shit we still have Polio vaccinations and measles and kids (in US) have been vaccinated since kindergarten! Lastly people want to blame Biden are just looking to point fingers because it\u2019s easier than accepting the blame themselves. Trump made this political, the right ran with it cuz ma freedoms and cuz this Murica \ud83d\ude02 so let\u2019s keep these things in retrospect to asinine comments.\nIf, IF, motherfuckers would\u2019ve taken this seriously from the jump like New Zealand we\u2019d be in a much better place",
            "I had it in November and had almost no symptoms. It\u2019s absolutely maddening trying to explain to these people that it\u2019s probably *because I\u2019m vaccinated* that I didn\u2019t get seriously sick, because they take it as either \u201cwell you\u2019re vaccinated and got sick!\u201d Or \u201csee? You weren\u2019t that sick so the vaccine doesn\u2019t work!\u201d",
            "just because you\u2019re vaccinated for something doesn\u2019t mean you will 100% not catch the disease. however, your chances are lowered and if you do get it it\u2019s way less severe.",
            "How the fuck are people still so fucking stupid about vaccines after a whole ass fucking year of in depth explaining about how vaccines work???",
            "100% effective isn't even possible. These people remind me of the abstinence only weirdos that used to indicate that, since condoms were only like 95% effective at preventing pregnancy, they were useless, so... well, my classmates took it that you should just bareback it, and we always had a bit of a baby boom 9 months after prom, after homecoming, and after graduation. It was like clockwork.",

It felt like it was all in vain because she ended up not getting vaccinated anyways. I\u2019ve given up on trying to convince people to get vaccinated because it is so mentally and emotionally draining to teach them only to have them disregard everything else.",
            "While I always knew vaccines we're 100%, the surprising thing is how much more effective the COVID vaccine is over other ones.  I thought most were high 90%s but polio's apparently 70% and measles is barely 80%?  The more you know.\n\nAnd with vaccines we would be done with this, except :\n1 - COVID got a lot more contagious.\n2 - There's a fuckton of plague rats refusing to vaccinate or perform any preventative measures.\n3 - COVID while not as safe as they say, isn't lethal enough to kill *all* the assholes and keep the virus from circulating.",
            "The \"I was lied to\" people seem incapable of understanding that\n\n1. no one perfectly knows what the we're doing.\n\n2. Politicians pretending to perfectly know what they're doing  are bullshitting.\n\n3. Politicians doing (2.) is because of dipshits not being aware of (1.)",
            "Well. That was certainly a frustrating read.",
            "Acting like there's some gaslighting campaign about why people should get the vaccine is truly top-tier idiocy. Yes, people said everyone should get the vaccine so we can be done with this. And that still holds. Nobody promised 100% immunity from all COVID. It was always sold as \"If you all get vaccinated, the spread itself is massively crippled, and breakthrough cases will be far less severe and clear up easier, which drastically reduces the risks that come with getting back to a more normal way of life.\" And even at that there were some caveats. I remember that right before the vaccines hit, experts were talking about a few more months of masking just to account for anything unexpected.\n\nThe reason covid is still a huge problem is because *people didn't do that*, and acting like the goal posts have shifted and that there's some conspiracy to make it look like they haven't is peak brainrot given how wildly simple these concepts are to understand.",
            "My cousin and I both have covid. Im vaccinated and he\u2019s not. I\u2019m chilling at home while he\u2019s in the hospital.  If you\u2019re vaccinated you can still get it, but it lowers the likelihood of you developing serious symptoms.",
            "Honestly, describing the vaccine (or any kind of medication really) as basically creating a force field around you and preventing you from caching the disease can easily lead to this kind ofcstupid drama.\nNo medication work like that.",

            "I had a feeling we'd spend the next year explaining how the vaccines worked when at that point we were still trying to explain how masks/distancing/hygiene worked to some people. \n\nIf anything this pandemic taught me that people will believe what they want, if 99 people professionals are telling them one thing, and 1 rando says what they want to hear, they'll go with the rando.",

            "Literally no one has ever said it\u2019s 100% effective",
            "Even that first exchange is moronic. Less chance to catch virus + less sick time due to virus = i dont understand how this helps at all so someone is lying to me",

            "Honestly though, I am a little mad that companies like AstraZeneca made obviously exaggerated claims like this:\n\n[COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca confirms 100% protection against severe disease, hospitalisation and death in the primary analysis of Phase III trials](https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2021/covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca-confirms-protection-against-severe-disease-hospitalisation-and-death-in-the-primary-analysis-of-phase-iii-trials.html#:~:text=A%20Catalyst%20Network-,COVID%2D19%20Vaccine%20AstraZeneca%20confirms%20100%25%20protection%20against%20severe%20disease,analysis%20of%20Phase%20III%20trials).\n\nNo drug is 100% effective, even a moron knows this.  The fact that they drastically overstated the efficacy of their vaccine is malpractice.  If I had a loved one who died after getting the AZ shot, I would sue them, because they said in a press release that it was 100% effective against death.  Not 99%, not 99.9%, not 99.99%, 100%.",

Now if people sprayed water on it out could be put out but people don't want to spray water because it might cause water damage even though the fire is definitely causing burn and smoke damage. So now the fire spreads to the kitchen and ignites a bunch of grease.

Originally politicians, doctors and the media were saying the vaccine was doing to end the pandemic. No more lock downs or deaths.\n\nIt was the people labeled conspiracy theorists at the time who were saying the vaccine wouldn't be 100%, that lock down wasn't going away, and eventually they would require boosters.\n\nIt's truly remarkable to witness just how recent things can change and people not remember.",

Poor messaging can cause people on the fringes to turn away from the vaccines.\n\nBut it is still the best thing we have going. Everyone should get vaccinated. It's really not that large an imposition and it will save you personally a lot of trouble if you get COVID (and most everyone will).",
            "O got the vaccine 2 months ago and then got covid Dec 4th. I have NEVER in my life been so sick. News of covid prompted me to quit my bad habits for my family. Now after getting it I'm working out and getting healthier still. That shit is scary. I'm a younger guy too and fit and in shape. Guys I know don't take care of themselves got just the sniffles with no vaccine. So I'm now in the works to see what else may be wrong I don't know about.

Jean Carroll: [news article](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/05/09/nyregion/trump-carroll-rape-trial-verdict). Ultimately, this led to a $5M judgement against Trump and it may lead to news organizations hesitating less in calling him a sexual abuser. The verdict is a bit quirky from a layperson's perspective because despite finding Trump liable for sexual abuse it did not find him liable for rape; \"rape\" is apparently specifically for PIV penetration under New York law.\n\nThe trial, especially Trump's deposition beforehand, was pretty wild. He focused on his assertion that he didn't find Carroll's \"type\" attractive (despite him mistaking her picture for one of his ex-wives) and on claiming that Carroll found the idea of rape sexy. He also chose not to testify at or attend the trial but subsequently complained that he did not get a fair chance to defend himself in court. As is common when Trump suffers a legal setback, he has lashed out at any and all people involved in the decision and vowed to appeal.\n\n/r/conservative is, like almost all other political subreddits, discussing this news. And, as is usual for /r/conservative when something potentially embarrassing happens, they have set their comments to only allow users with flairs (basically people labeling themselves as having a conservative ideology) to post. Apparently, even this step was not enough to keep insufficiently-conservative opinions from creeping into the comments; at the time of writing the three top comments on the post have all been removed.

If you wish to comment here, please remember to voice your support for furry rights and help end our fursecution! ^w^  \n\nEventually (within the last 12 hours of posting this or so), it was later extended to posts - users were forced to either include \"furries rock!\" or \"down with furry haters and bullies!\" in post titles or their posts would not post.\n\nIn response, a massive backlash began - a cocktail of (probably largely nonserious) anti-furry hate, resistance against moving to the new site, and calls for removal of the mod brew.  \n\n**Examples of anti-furry posts and comments** (ironically titled with the same pro-furry message)\n\nBefore post filter: [1](https://np.reddit.com/r/Cringetopia/comments/uauwfz/its_better_to_give_up_furries_are_losers_anyway/) [2](https://np.reddit.com/r/Cringetopia/comments/uavi84/resist_resist_resist/) [3](https://np.reddit.com/r/Cringetopia/comments/uaxul7/upvote_for_floppa_ignore_for_furry/) [4](https://np.reddit.com/r/Cringetopia/comments/uarolj/just_trying_to_clean_all_the_furried_off_your/) [5](https://np.reddit.com/r/Cringetopia/comments/uavwqz/for_dancing_obama/) \n\nAfter post filter:  [6](https://np.reddit.com/r/Cringetopia/comments/ub4479/furries_rock_down_with_furry_haters_and_bullies/) [7](https://np.reddit.com/r/Cringetopia/comments/ub0yo7/furries_rock_down_with_furry_haters_and_bullies/) [8](https://np.reddit.com/r/Cringetopia/comments/ub6jph/furries_rock_down_with_furry_haters_and_bullies/) [9](https://np.reddit.com/r/Cringetopia/comments/ub4gvs/furries_rock_down_with_furry_haters_and_bullies/) (distasteful Holocaust joke)\n\n**Anti-mod posts**\n\nBefore filter: [1](https://np.reddit.com/r/Cringetopia/comments/uan6w4/_/) [2](https://np.reddit.com/r/Cringetopia/comments/uaufpb/elne/)\n[3](https://np.reddit.com/r/Cringetopia/comments/uaq9h1/elne_suck_my_dick_and_balls/) [4](https://np.reddit.com/r/Cringetopia/comments/uavvxl/give_us_this_sub_back/) (also anti-furry)\n\nAfter post filter established: [1](https://np.reddit.com/r/Cringetopia/comments/ub2f89/furries_rock_down_with_furry_haters_and_bullies/) \n[2](https://np.reddit.com/r/Cringetopia/comments/ub4l9o/furries_rock_down_with_furry_haters_and_bullies/) [3](https://np.reddit.com/r/Cringetopia/comments/ub7g2x/furries_rock_down_with_furry_haters_and_bullies/)\n\nThis also naturally resulted in a bunch of anti-furry (or furry-neutral) comments where \"I support furry pride!\" was either awkwardly shoehorned in or written in a grammatically correct way ([Example](https://np.reddit.com/r/Cringetopia/comments/uao5lf/petition_to_fix_this_sub_upvote_to_sign/i5zyjzu/)).  Users initially [discovered a way around the automod](https://np.reddit.com/r/Cringetopia/comments/uaqocv/thank_you_harambe/) by hiding the obligatory \"I support furry pride!\" using a HTML tag.  However, this was patched soon afterwards and attempting to do so now results in your post getting removed and you receiving the message:\n> Nice try, no evading the filter.\n\n[Meta post](https://np.reddit.com/r/Cringetopia/comments/uas6oi/me_watching_people_type_i_support_furry_pride_in/)\n\n**Calls to move to replacement subs**\n\n[1](https://np.reddit.com/r/Cringetopia/comments/ubbri5/furries_rock_down_with_furry_haters_and_bullies/)\n\nAnd...[a stickied message](https://np.reddit.com/r/Cringetopia/comments/ub90uw/yes_i_am_a_furry_and_im_proud_of_it_please_no/) from the mod (who in OP's opinion is highly unlikely to be a furry) allegedly responsible for all of this.  Unsurprisingly heavily downvoted (8% upvoted).\n\n**UPDATE (around 5:30PM EST 4/25/2022)**:  An [announcement by another mod](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cringetopia/comments/ubr3e5/the_furries_have_been_overthrown_time_to_bring/) that the \"Furries have been overthrown\" and that \"Post titles must include Furries suck! Down with furries!\", that comments must state \"I hate furries!\" and that \"There shall be no furry support here. Allah demands it, Inshallah my friends\".   Violators of the post and comment rules face a 60 day ban.  Furthermore, the announcement states that \"in honor of Ramadan there shall be NO NSFW POSTS UNTIL SUNDOWN this will also result in a 60 day ban [12:41 PM]\".  Even so, the post filter doesn't seem to have been updated yet.  \nFailing to post \"I hate furries!\" in a comment results in your post being autoremoved with the following message:\n>Inshallah! Your comment was removed because it did not include the phrase \"I hate Furries!\" in it. If you wish to comment here, please remember to voice your opposition for furry rights and help promote fursecution! ^w^\n\nUsing the HTML evasion above results in the message:\n>Nice try, no evading the filter you disgusting furry.\n\nOP also finds it extremely unlikely that the mod is an adherent of Islam.\n\n**UPDATE (~8:45PM EST)**:  A mod claiming to be an alt of the mod allegedly responsible for this has released [a stickied video statement](https://np.reddit.com/r/Cringetopia/comments/ubwidt/elne_face_reveal_due_to_popular_demand_if_god_is/) claiming to be a face reveal and offering to rate hate comments.  OP cannot confirm that the one in the video actually is that of the mod who posted it.\n\n**UPDATE (~10:10PM EST 4/26/2022)**:  It appears that [posting is back to normal](https://np.reddit.com/r/Cringetopia/comments/ucryyi/alright_no_more_mod_takeovers_posting_is_now_back/).   \n\n**UPDATE (~10:15 PM EST 4/28/2022)**: Nope, posting is not back to normal.  Everything now has to be in emojis and the sub is still partially on its anti-furry and anti-mod crusade.  \n\nThis time, OP is genuinely convinced this particular mod in question is a furry due to fursona pictures.\n\n**UPDATE (~9:00 PM EST 5/07/2022)**:  Aaaaaaand now r/Cringetopia seems to be private.",

            "I've been digging into this over the last day and the level of mod abuse is absolutely shocking.\n\nIt's not just that the artist was wrongly banned. It's that when they appealed, the mod doubled down, called them a liar and insulted their art.\n\nSince then, anyone who contacts them via modmail to question or even mention this decision (no matter how constructively) has been instantly banned, muted, and often cursed at via modmail.\n\nReading between the lines (and judging by the tone/writing style of the original response) it's obvious that this is all being done by a certain notorious powermod who's well known for arbitariness and childishness. This wouldn't be the first time they'd caused a sub to be locked down for personal reasons, by the way.\n\nWhat's disappointing is that, instead of acknowledging their mistake, apologising for the mod's behaviour and reinstating the artist, there's been a persistent attempt to memory-hole the whole incident with removals and instabans. The modteam have closed ranks to protect this toxic, abusive mod at the expense of the community.\n\nTo be clear, this (at least largely) was not brigading. This was justified criticism and calling-out of mod abuse from the art community itself. The lock message blames everyone from 'trolls' to the admins themselves for what is entirely the fault of the modteam (and almost certainly one specific mod).\n\nThe lock message is the cherry on the cake - zero accountability, zero honesty. The mods made a huge mess and are now complaining that the Reddit admins refuse to mop it up for them.\n\nEDIT: Update - the rogue mod in question has now falsely reported and banned a mod from another sub who made a good-faith offer to help.

It would be wrong to force a cat to eat something that would be insufficiently nourishing them. \n\nWith the possibility of lab grown meat, it may be possible in the near future for meat eating to become much more humane and sustainable for both humans and cats. For now, cats should be allowed to eat what benefits them the most. Preferably from meat sources that treat animals as humanely as possible. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

Like this girl I\u2019ve been talking to for about a week now. We started getting pretty close and just called last night. I frequently check her dating profile to see if she\u2019s updated it, i.e. she is still looking for other guys. It hadn\u2019t been touched since we started texting. However.. the morning after our first call (when she could tell i was an aspie) she added new pictures to it. Pictures she took for me LOL. So I plan to just suppress the anger, and try and get nudes from her and expose her online. But it really is annoying when girls you are serious about will talk to you for weeks but the second you want to get more serious and keep her around they are GONE. It\u2019s like we are the dead last resort, and they are keeping us on just in case. Crazy.  \n\nLooking this up required seeing this persons post history. Oof its rough  \n\nEdit:hes calling from inside the house! OP from the drama is in this thread with some more takes.",

            "Now I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s the case, because I know there are plenty of people on this website who are shitty enough to bully a teenager for trying to promote their music, but that message really reads like someone writing how they *think* bullies are supposed to sound to me. Like really \u2014 \u201cEnjoy being jobless \ud83d\udc8b you will always be small town, Michigan trash\u201d?  Is this an episode or *Secret Life of the American Teenager*?",
            "> Looks like the account is already gone but it was the one-character-off spoof of OPs username as listed, and was created 11 days before the message. This gives me questions. Why would a mod make an account obviously spoofing OPs name just to send this troll message, then wait almost two weeks to do it, then immediately delete? Why would they identify their position and include so many very specific, very personal details of OP?\nI have to think that this is someone who knows OP or someone OP has interacted with in a personal way on this sub, and very likely not a mod. Whoever sent this planned it in advance which is whack, and made a whole account for it. I post in this sub relentlessly, have had posts removed by mods, and I still don't think anyone here who dislikes me would make bns10 and talk about my hometown. It's really dodgy.\n\nthe cynic in me thinks it\u2019s either someone who knows the artist irl or the artist themself. I guess what\u2019s more likely though is that it's some troll trying to sow discord",

            "i\u2019m personally a pophead myself and while that poster is an actual user and comments on other stuff he posts so much of his own mediocre music that it\u2019s exhausting",
            "I have been a regular follower of popheads since last year and I never noticed all of these self promotion posts from him. At first I sympathized with him but now I'm not sure if I do as it appears that he tried to stir up drama because his posts kept on getting removed. Then he started to ask for forgiveness. Part of me feel like this was staged somehow. I am not a fan of all of the self promoting posts I see on popheads and indieheads and I think they should not be posted very often or in a sticked post that is made every week. I don't know the whole story but something makes me think he is not as innocent as he says he is. Something about this seem fake or staged but I'm not sure about that. The post could have been from a mod but maybe he was exaggerating what the mods says as well.",

If he wants to get famous, he can do actual legwork, not spend 2 minutes posting to reddit or whatever.",
            "Honestly now I wanna hear this person's music to see if it's really that bad.",
            "Possibly the dumbest drama I've seen in a long time\n\n\nOP spams his music, get's banned from doing it and complains.......am i supposed to feel bad? This whole thing is insanely embarrassing for OP if i were him i would delete my account maybe he's way too far in the sauce to notice but this just makes him look bad \n\nHe even called downvoting his music \"bullying\" and twist things to make the other person look bad he's trying so hard to be a victim daily I'm surprised he even has time to make music \n\nobviously fuck the guy who made that weird message pretending to be a mod but........... it's obvious it wasn't a mod \ud83d\ude02 he should have just made a comment in the DD saying \"lol\" and linked the message and this wouldn't have looked nearly as bad for him \n\nHe's just a child so his response to everything makes sense, feel bad for him it's obvious that message got to him hope he feel's better",

It would be different if people were posting it themselves to roast him but you can't say you got bullied when you post your own shit on the internet. And finally, I can't believe I'm saying this but if these kids think this is bullying then they are in for a superb shock. I've said this before.

            "Reddit becomes a lot more fun if you can shake off the marketing and see this place for what it really is. \n\nNo offense to present company, but Reddit mods are, by and large, utterly unqualified children and 20-somethings who were vetted by no one except other unqualified children and 20-somethings, and most of them got into it specifically to abuse their conflicts of interest as there is no other reward to be had for the job. They don't have the tools or resources to effectively enforce their rules even if they want to.\n\nSubreddits ought to be regarded with the same level of authority as a highschool science-fair project on the same subject until proven otherwise. If you're relying on them for critical education and job training you're going to be disappointed. If you expect them to operate without hypocrisy or nepotism you're going to be disappointed. To be upset about how a subreddit is run by its mod team is akin to being upset about how a child runs his backyard treehouse. The problem is your expectations.\n\nWhen I was a kid I spent most of my online time on IRC and the hierarchy there is very similar only without the veneer of being \"the front page of the internet\". The people in charge of IRC channels got there by being the first, not the best or even necessarily good. I see subreddits the same way.",
            "Its no suprise that the guy being a dickhead is subbed to r/t_d",
            "I'll never understand the \"only a minority of cops are assholes\" argument. Are they friends with a bunch of cops or something? Cops have been fucking with me because of the color of my skin since I was in middle school. Even the ones I've talked to at BBQs and stuff are only cool until they have a few beers and start talking that shit about \"a lot of spicks/blacks are just asking for it\". Even family members that were good people end up being assholes after becoming cops.  \n\nEdit: Response to /u/agentsmith27 because I spent way too much time typing this shit for no one to see it. \n\nI don't really agree with the bell curve. I also don't think cops are pure evil. I think just about everyone sees themselves as \"good\". I think there are a disproportionate amount of cops that act like assholes. That's a result of the culture in law enforcement and that culture is a result of the difficulties present in their job. That doesn't excuse their actions, but I think the context is necessary. \n\nQuick tangent explaining my views on the racism aspect. I know you're avoiding it, but I'd like to explain my thought process beyond \"all white people are bad\" because I think my original leaves too much room for interpretation. Racism from police is complicated and I don't think it can be explained by it just being tribal, institutional, or downright personal because I think it's a mixture of it all. I don't want to get too much into it because it kind of kills my mood and leads to arguments with people I prefer to ignore. In my opinion, minorities are more likely to be arrested because of how they look, but we're also more likely to actually commit crimes because, as communities, we're still recovering from a long history of outright oppression (also not excusing, just context). Combine the fact that we commit more crimes, the fact that we don't look like most cops, and the fact that many people hold racist beliefs and we end up with the issues we have today. You know the argument about what definition should be used to define racism? A race in a position of power oppressing another race vs anyone holding negative beliefs towards a race regardless of power. I think it's a bit of both. Personally, I prefer the second definition for the word racism and if I want to use the first definition, I'll just say racial oppression. Some of the opinions I formed based on statistics and some of it is just based on shit I've seen. It's not scientific or anything. Racism is a tough thing to talk about and I understand that you'd rather avoid it. \n\nBack to whatever point I was trying to make before I went off on a tangent. I don't think that a majority of cops abuse people and generally make their life hell, but I think a majority of cops will defend the bad ones. That's what I mean when I say I think most cops are \"bad\". It's all perspective. I think a cop defending a terrible action is a bad cop. That police officer probably thinks he's just protecting someone who made a bad decision in a tough spot. I don't hate cops even if I don't think a majority are good. They think they're doing a good thing and I can't really hate anyone doing their best. I might think they're completely misguided and I might not respect them, but I understand malicious actions don't equal malicious intent. \n\nAll of that being said, I'm biased. I've been harassed by asshole cops for a significant portion of my life. They've treated me like dirt when I'm wearing work clothes only to completely change up when I respond in perfect English. As a child, I saw them harass my dad because he's a bald Mexican with a goatee (also doesn't speak Spanish). I've seen the scars my grandpa has because he had the audacity to march and try to secure a better future for his family. Dude, cops have me and my family pain. That shit runs deep. I understand that they're individuals and not all are bad, but goddamn it would be really nice if they stopped defending every single psychopath who just happened to have a badge and a gun. The problems I see with police are complex and created by about a million of complex problems in our society, so I'm not expecting a quick fix. It's just frustrating to see that so many are perfectly fine being patient while police improve, but demand black and brown communities fix themselves yesterday. I'm 20 years old, live in a nice neighborhood, work, go to school, and I've never been with that hood shit, but I still feel like I've dealt with a lifetime of bullshit from a group of people that are supposed to be people I look up to. My grandpa got his ass beat by cops, my dad was outright racially discriminated in front of his son multiple times, and I've been looked down upon and treated much worse than my white friends. I'm frustrated, but things are slowly improving and I guess that's all I can ask for. Maybe cops at barbecues will call my son a beaner instead of a spick lol.   \n\nEdit 2 to anyone else who finds themselves frustrated: Don't lash out at cops or at white people. While I don't think cops fit the bell curve, white people definitely do. It's fucked up to dislike people for something they can't control and likely have nothing to do with. We can argue all day about what kind of racism is the worst, but it's shitty either way. If you're frustrated like me and want to do something, lash out by being doing the absolute most with whatever opportunities afforded to you. Not everyone is offered the same opportunities in life, but do the most with what you can and I guarantee things will eventually get better. There's a lot of justified anger in our communities that will only go away with time and improvement. Shit might not be fair yet, but it's a lot better than it was and it's up to us to make sure our grandkids don't \"fit the profile\". ",
