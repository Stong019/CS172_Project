            "[This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/ggne2g/how_feminism_ruins_video_games/fq3y8j7) is just so close to being /r/Selfawarewolves material.\n\n>Feminism hasn't done anything good for women. \n\nI'm sure you're about to tell us all why.\n\n>Feminism didn't get women into the workforce - Women across the globe and time have been working long before men do.\n\nThis is literally a huge point that feminists have been trying to make the entire time the movement has existed, even before it had the name Feminism.  Women *have* been working the entire time humans have existed, whether it's in the home or the workplace, they've just been paid less, received less recognition, and had a much harder time advancing in many careers than men have, historically.  There are obviously exceptions (teaching, nursing), but in general women have absolutely been busting their asses with way less to show for it than a comparable man, and have even been explicitly barred from whole segments of working society (rules against women being doctors, for instance). Not to mention all the stupid expectations/rules women have had to follow that men haven't (I know of school districts in my state that didn't change their dress codes to let female teachers wear pants until the *2000s*).\n\n>Feminism or more accurately the suffragettes, got women the right to vote without the responsibility of voting, which is being conscripted to fight in wars if needed.\n\nHe should bring this up to the men who made this unequal situation rather than bitching about the feminists who want to change it.  Most mainstream feminist organizations oppose the draft, or believe that women should be included in it if it continues to exist.\n\n>Feminism didn't give women choices on how to live their lives - Now most women have to work instead of having the option of being a stay at home mother.\n\nHe literally just said that women have been working the entirety of human history, but thinks that it's only after Feminism that women have *had* to work?  That makes no sense.  Women have had to get jobs and work for all of recorded history, oftentimes *while simultaneously* being the primary homemaker/caregiver.\n\n>Feminism didn't sexually liberate women, that was accomplished by the pill.\n\nWhich existed for decades but was not popularized until feminists worked to make it widely available and destigmatize it.\n\n>Besides, sexual liberation in addition to no fault divorces and the welfare state policies have resulted in the destruction to the traditional family unit and the institution of marriage.\n\nThe US is not a welfare state and never has been, no-fault divorce is a *good* thing because it means people can split up amicably rather than forcing somebody to lose in court, and even if the \"traditional family\" and the institution of marriage*were* being \"destroyed\", that would only be bad if you think they were fine as they were.\n\n>Having said all that, I love feminism. \n\nNo you don't, you like having something to demonize rather than actually confront complicated systemic and cultural issues concerning gender.\n\nYou see, for the longest time in history, women had the feminine mystique to hide their toxic feminity behind. \n\n>I mean, feminism is, at the end of the day, politicised toxic femininity.\n\nThe only reason you have that term is because of Feminism. You literally wouldn't have the language to describe the concepts you're talking about if it weren't for feminists.\n\n>For the most part feminism is about women nagging, whining and complaining that men are the problem and men must fix their problem - It is the entitled spoiled toxic female bratty behavior displayed on a society wide scale.\n\nThe irony of this statement coming from a man is just palpable.\n\n>Thanks to feminism, men like me can see toxic female behavior for what they are, discard our traditional male gender role shackles and be free.  \n\nYou're welcome.\n\n>As a man, I have more freedom than my father or uncle or grandfather have ever had.\n\nI think you seriously underestimate the privilege held by men in certain points throughout history, but I don't know your grandfather so maybe.\n\n>Sex is plentiful and cheap. Marriage is something no rational man will commit himself to. There's plenty of money saved by not spending a dime of it on entertainment that has been ruined by feminism. As such, men like me can live a simple, peaceful, minimalist lifestyle. \n\n>Only men who are white knights, simps, and pussy beggars are the ones suffering.\n\nHe said, without a trace of self awareness or compassion.\n\n>Feminism emancipated men who are wise enough and smart enough to see the world for what it actually is and adapt accordingly. \n\n*Sigh*",

            "Oh yay Last of Us drama.\n\nShit like this is why I\u2019ve largely checked out of gaming communities, it\u2019s incredibly hard to find a group of people that won\u2019t complain about women every damn 30 seconds. \n\nAnd all their complaints are just so unfounded it\u2019s laughable. \n\n> Developers keep on making the women in their games ugly!!!! It\u2019s not realistic it\u2019s just an agenda!!!!\n\nAs if men in video games are all fucking Adonises\n\n> They always try too hard to make them strong and then they become Mary sues!!!\n\nAhhh yes gaming, legendary for its incredibly realistic heroes that totally aren\u2019t Mary Sues like, original trilogy Kratos, Master Chief, Doomguy, Gordon Freeman, Solid Snake and many many others. You\u2019re allowed to be overpowered if you\u2019re a man make sure you remember that guys! \n\n> No one wants to see all these gay people in video games, they aren\u2019t the audience\n\nI wanted Ocelot to French kiss snake in MGSV, and I know I\u2019m not the only one. But seriously I\u2019d like more gay people in video games, the last one I can think of is Hammerlock and Wainwright from Borderlands 3, which was really cute.

They only make up ##% of gamers so why bother unless it is to pander?\u201d No matter the percent it is still part of the audience, giving them someone to identify with can lead to more interest, this statement also implies that every straight/white/male character is pandering to the straight white male demographic, right? If it makes no difference why put energy into being pissed about it instead of just accepting that they are part of the game world.\n\n3: \u201cWhy do they bother explaining this character is gay? Why do I need to know that?\u201d Why bother explaining characters are straight? The people who immediately start throwing toys from their crib when they hear a guy/girl refer to having a love interest that is the same sex it always reminds me of old people looking on with disgust at gay couples kissing, there is no logical reason whatsoever to be upset by it, who cares?\n\n4: \u201cMaking a point of adding these characters is adding political themes and statements to the game.\u201d If it has been said once it has been said a million times, games have always had politics, The Witcher 3 within itself first few hours has political themes about class, abortion, war. Mass Effect hits heavily on themes of co-existance. Resident evil deals with evil corporations and military over-reach (the T-Virus was intended to be sold for use by the military), hell the most hyped game of recent memory Cyberpunk 2077 makes statements about gender identity, the evil nature of corporations, and body image. A characters race or sexuality has nothing to do with story or gameplay, a character having a boyfriend has no bearing more than them having a girlfriend.\n\nEvery time I see threads like this I try my best to see their side, see what issues they are seeing and at times I understand, if it is obviously something in bad taste or nonsensical (the BFV trailer for instance) then I get it, but when people complain because it shows a character kissing someone of their same sex it becomes apparent that the complaint is coming from a place of prejudice, not from someone who cares about the game.",

            "4 hours is a ridiculously long movie, but I guess at the end of the day it isn't that surprising. As I understand it, it seems like a lot of the DC films (Justice League, Batman V Superman, Suicide Squad) had a lot of the same issues - the studio is/was terribly managed and the people in charge had no real plan or vision for what films they wanted or how they'd fit together, so by the time any decisions were made the writers and directors were given ridiculously short timelines to achieve a shitload of arbitrary studio-mandated goals.\n\nBecause of that, a lot of these movies started filming while the scripts were still basically loose rough drafts. The directors were forced to shoot a fuck ton more footage than they'd normally need because they still didn't even really know what the final movie would look like, or if certain subplots or scenes would be included in the final edit... hence why so many of them also required extensive re-shoots to make the plot coherent and fill in gaps in the story, because the plot was still being written and re-written in the middle of filming.\n\nSo yeah, I expect this version will probably be closer to Snyder's original planned script, but it'll also probably be a bloated, unfocused, meandering mess. The length is basically the result of the cast and crew spending months of filming throwing shit at the wall, and Snyder deciding that every bit of it should be allowed to stick.",

It's like someone failing a test, then being given detailed feedback on what was wrong with their answers and a second chance to pass. **Of course** the next one is going to be better, how could it not? That's not really much of a benchmark.\n\n\"Better than JL\" isn't good enough to justify this, because I'm pretty sure just about anyone with all those advantages could make it better.

My other two roommates (a very nice couple) have never once bothered my food, and I have been more than willing to share ingredients or other foods that I buy already prepared, because they\u2019re always respectful and ask me.\nMore times than I can count, I have found that at least 2 meals a week go missing, and I have to scramble to pay extra money for fast food on my way to or between classes. I\u2019ll find my Tupperware in her room, on one occasion I could see she left one of my meals in the backseat of her car, totally wasted. I\u2019ve spoken to her about this at least 10 times already, each time her denying ever taking my food. She\u2019s also made a habit of dipping into my weed stash when I\u2019m not home. I\u2019ll notice that I\u2019ll buy an 8th, and nearly half of it would be gone when I get home from work. I know it\u2019s definitely A, because my other roommates both have government jobs that randomly drug test. They do not partake in the devils lettuce.\nNow that the semester is over and I\u2019ve spent almost a year putting up with her bullshit antics, I decided to have a little fun before she left for the summer. It\u2019s disgusting, but I felt like it would be worth it and satisfying for me. I opted to buy a decent sized mini fridge for my room and have been keeping most of my pre made meals in there. I decided to leave 4 decoy potions in the regular fridge, properly marked as usual. Only this time I add an extra...sauce.\nI won\u2019t mince words here, I basically just put jizz in the food. That in itself was a sort of science experiment of sorts getting an even amount in each portion, but I did it, and I won\u2019t lie, I almost died of laughter doing it. I left the food in the fridge and low and behold, I came home from work the next evening and one of the meals was gone. I figured I\u2019d just leave the rest in the fridge and see if she\u2019d get even more bold and take another. Unfortunately she did not, but I definitely felt like my petty revenge was a success",

            "> We are witnessing the biggest scam in the history of video games.\n\nIn the dark recesses of history (the mid to late 1980s) a studio called The Power House set out to make some games for the home computer market.  They no longer exist for reasons that will become apparent shortly.  Back in the day, studios didn't really give a damn what they were selling, so a common way budget studios would get games to distribute was to run advertisements in gaming magazines asking amateurs to send in games in exchange for a fee, which the game studio would then sell under their own name.  Most of the people who responded to these ads were the people reading the magazines, so a large amount were written by children.  In 1987, 13 year old Jason Kendall wrote [the game SQIJ](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/crappy-games/images/7/7f/Sqij3.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20180415200818) for the Commodore 64.  He sold it to The Power House for a sum of \u00a3300.  This was the first game he had ever made, and he essentially learned to program while making the game.\n\nThe Power House wished to sell the game across more formats than just the C64, and Kendall, being a literal child with no experience, couldn't convert the game into other formats, so they turned to another person, Jason Creighton, to convert the game for the ZX Spectrum.  Creighton was also a child, because of course he was.  The studio knew about Creighton because he had sent in several games for the Spectrum prior to the SQIJ conversion.  None were deemed good enough to release, but his number was kept on hand and the boss of The Power House decided that this child who had never written a game good enough to publish before would be the perfect person to convert their game for them.\n\nThe Power House did not supply Creighton with a copy of the game he was converting initially, instead he was shown the game in the studio.  He had to go to their office in order to complain until one was given to him.  This was The Power House, so they gave Creighton the game on a disc.  He had no disc drive, and thus could not use it.  The only time he ever saw the game he was converting was in The Power House's office.  The publisher then sent Creighton a copy of the game's code, and told him he had a month to finish the conversion.  Creighton, being a child, decided that instead of doing the conversion, he would instead not do it.  He assembled what he had using the Laser BASIC compiler, then sent it in.\n\nSQIJ, being a game written by a child and then hastily converted by another child, did not work.  The Spectrum treats keys pressed with the caps lock on as different keys than those pressed with the caps lock off.  SQIJ required the player to move using the z, x, k and m keys but Creighton had accidentally inserted a line of code which caused the caps lock key to be permanently on, meaning the computer would see inputs as the Z, X, K and M keys and would not respond to any inputs.  It is possible to manually change the game code while it's running using a memory poke, and thereby turn off the caps lock.  The player will find that doing so will allow them to move, however the character's movements cause a variety of graphical glitches (mostly leaving pieces of himself behind as he moves) and they are sometimes unable to leave the opening room.  The first line of SQIJ's code is something along the lines of, line 10: go to line 20.  There is no line 20.  I have seen one video of the ZX Spectrum version of SQIJ running correctly.  It plays exactly as well as you imagine it would given the above information.  Creighton also left the Laser BASIC code in the game, thereby pirating that software.\n\nThe Power House, receiving this game that was literally impossible to play and also illegal to distribute because of the Laser BASIC, decided that the only sporting thing to do was to never test the game and immediately begin selling it.  It was sold in shops for \u00a31.99 as both a single cassette and later in a compilation.  This was not even the shiftiest thing I can think of from late 80s computer games, just one of the funnier ones.\n\nBut yeah, the lame phone game about the demon boy is the biggest scam to ever hit gaming.",

I think their past afforded them many thinly veiled passes but this was the breaking point. \n\nIf you're wondering why mobile got such a bad reaction there's a few reasons.\n \n - They were teasing announcements for the Diablo property at blizzcon. Diablo was the quintessential ARPG property. Imagine if half life 3 was announced for iPad or if star wars episode 7 was announced as a SyFy special. \n\n - NetEase is considered by chinese as a \"pig-farm.\" their games contain leaderboards and the only way to get there is spend upwards of 20 thousand dollars on the title. \n\n - NetEase (and blizzard) have removed the only black character from the game to appeal to the Chinese market\n\n - Blizzard has been removing likes/comments from youtube. They also changed what youtube video was linked on their dashboard to reduce the amount of dislikes.\n\n - The game is already an editors choice on the google play store",

It's not a scam. \n\n\nNot even salty on that point- I just won't play it- but aggressively marketing your free to play micro-transaciton laden game to people who are stuck as a captive audience is a bit much.

If anyone bought tickets to Blizzcon under the expectation that they were getting news about D4 or another D3 expansion they are legally retarded.

Cause there's clearly blunders from Blizz and how that conference was handled and how certain people are reacting to the news but somehow the focus has gone to dissin the angry consumers while relieving Blizz of the blame.

            "I dont think its counterproductive to get vocal about a collective disinterest in the way the industry is heading. They arent making these games for the average person. Something like 20% of a given playerbase spends more on micro-transactions than the other 80% does on the purchase price of the game. So you can: not buy the game, accept the situation, or be vocal about your dislike. \n\nPersonally, when a company only listens to money but they own a widely beloved IP that prevents people from creating their own variant, I think being vocal can be a good thing.

That doesn't sound like a scam to me at all. I might be missing major facts heree so I might be wrong. ",
            "The anger around this topic isn't unjustified.  The hyperbolic language is being used rhetorically, not literally.\n\nWhat you have to understand is that people become attached to entertainment properties.  People were upset about the Star Wars prequels because they were so awful.  People were upset by The Hobbit Trilogy because of how convoluted and stupid and how much of a departure from the source material it was.  People being upset about Diablo is the same thing.\n\nYou also need to consider context.  Diablo 3 had one of the weakest launches in Blizzard's storied history.  The real money auction house was a disaster, their tuning passes caused huge backlash because people had spent real money on items that were bricked overnight.  It launched without a significant number of promised features.  The time between content releases and patches has been entirely too long.  There has been no significant movement for the whole franchise in nearly 4 years.  So, when at your largest event of the year, in front of a room of Western PC gamers, your big announcement for a core franchise of your brand is that you're releasing a mobile title in partnership with a Chinese mobile developer, the cynicism isn't remotely unexpected.  If this had been announced alongside a new expansion for Diablo 3, or better yet, Diablo 4, the reaction would have been much more positive.\n\nHowever, mobile games are a Chinese market-centric strategy for low-overhead revenue generation that are rife with pay to win micro-transactions and inconsistent netcode quality.  As a stockholder, I'm ecstatic that A-B is entering the ridiculously lucrative Chinese mobile game market.  As a fan and player, I'm incredibly disappointed.",

I won\u2019t pretend like it isn\u2019t strictly greed based, and if trends in mobile gaming are any indication it will probably be a money grubbing piece of garbage, but... diablo 3 is not going anywhere. You can still play the whole game to your hearts content with all the expansions on PC and console. If I understand correctly, there is going to be some content added to the mobile version which won\u2019t be on the original, which is certainly frustrating for fans. They have every right to be upset, but this is being blown massively out of proportion. If Diablo 4 was announced and it was going to be a mobile phone exclusive, than this reaction would be justified. As is, just don\u2019t buy it and be done with it. \n\nTo their credit, we really have to pray and hope this does not set a precedent for other games. If this sells well (which I fear it may, considering the target audience would be the causal crowd), than it\u2019s strong incentive to other devs to do something similar. Mobile games have some potential to make bank with very low effort. My nightmare is hearing announcements like: Rockstar delays work on GTA VI to focus on a mobile version of GTA V.

Release of a mobile game from Diablo franchise just feels to the player base like Activision Blizzard is trying to get quick cash grap. One of the most interesting controversy that I found funny was from last year. \n\n\n**When one of their biggest ARPG competition had memes subreddit:**\n > [GGG's Path of Exile six new acts for free vs. Diablo 3 Necromancer class DLC $15](https://i.redd.it/hkgbkdfwqf9z.jpg) \n\nPeople would hope that Diablo mobile game had been released as additional game with like remake of Diablo 2, which we know that they have been planning to make. Competition at this point is getting further and futher away. While sadly Diablo 2 glory days are over, Diablo 3 was far from peoples expectations and renewal of bringing these old fans back to franchise with a mobile game is such a stretch that nobody wanted to see.\n\n > [Kripparian somewhat expert on this field.](https://clips.twitch.tv/WanderingSullenSmoothieGrammarKing) \n\nAdditionally, seems like Blizzard BfA beta feedback and now with Diablo franchise seems to be out of their reach knowing what their players actually want them to do.\n\n > *tinfoil hat* \n\nMany ways as a Finn this reminds me much like Nokia's fall. I know this a stretch of theory but listen. The thing that ruined Nokia being the biggest mobile phone manufacturer was because company had bad communication management within the company itself. Hearing these things happening Activation Blizzard on past years. I just have a bad feeling like the company itself is going into similar path down. Before these things can get better they must get worse and from there company can grow out being market leader again and produce really good games. **I hope im wrong.**",

And it allows them to make cash on the Chinese mobile gaming market as well.\n\nIt only rustles the jimmies of hardcore gamers, really, and as we all know this subset is significantly overrepresented on socmedia and especially gaming subreddits.",

            ">edit: Here's an interesting breakdown from the creator of Apollo that estimates these API costs will profit reddit about 20x more per user than reddit would make from the user had they simply stayed directly on reddit-owned platforms.\n\nNot really the point, but it would drive me crazy if I didn't point out that the Apollo dev has a mistake in his math  \n\n\n>For Apollo, the average user uses 344 requests daily, or 10.6K monthly.

The former is \"daily unique users\" while the latter is \"monthly unique users\".\n\n\n------\n\nTLDR: Apollo has [1.3M-1.5M monthly users](https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/31/popular-reddit-app-apollo-may-go-out-of-business-over-reddits-new-unaffordable-api-pricing/#:~:text=Apollo%20today%20has%20around%201.3,roughly%20900%2C000%20daily%20active%20users.), which maths out to $1.12-$1.29 per user monthly (not $2.50).

            "Not surprising to be honest; reddit has a history of safeguarding racists and skeptics. I just saw two people bitching about BLM all the time on /r/askreddit one of reddits most primary accounts when you first join up. And when the george floyd death happened? Guess what? A lot of fucking morons just keep popping up with racist/ alt-right bait questions. Posts and what not about the situation. \n\nReddit needs to change shit and grow the fuck up and the mods need to grab at it. But they won't because they just have to keep appealing to nerds who have nothing else better things to do but troll liberals.",
            "Howdy yall, I'm the guy from the post. I went to bed last night before I saw this and only woke up like an hour ago. Here's my perspective of what happened, hopefully it'll answer a few questions I've seen yall asking in here. \n\nThe r/nfl daily threads have evolved to be sort of a sub community in r/nfl. I've become a pretty popular user in that community. When reddit was collapsing comments with crowd control earlier this week, I was a user that was collapsed consistently, and we made a lot of jokes about that. When another user told me I was uncollapsed,\nI replied with \"FUCK YOU SPEZ\" as a joke and went about my business for an hour or so. I went to upvotes a comment and the pop up came up for my account being suspended. [Here was the PM I got](https://imgur.com/a/c80tH17), the link led to the Fuck you Spez comment. My first reaction was honestly to laugh, cuz like, that's pretty fucking funny. I guess I thought it was standard procedure and everyone that tagged spez got a ban. I showed it to some friends that also use the r/nfl free talk threads and one of them [posted](https://old.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/h121us/thursday_talk_thread_yes_thats_the_thread_name/ftq3lu0/) that I got suspended for that comment. Now, as we do, everyone in the thread started shitposting about it while I watched from the sideline. A lot of users began tagging spez and saying fuck you (like a lot of yall are doing as well lmao). I saw at least 4 users do this but only two others were banned. Later that night, I check my inbox and see [this](https://m.imgur.com/a/FTEv0BJ). Now, it isn't everyday you get a personal PM from spez himself, and r/nfl has been shitposting about this all day, so it took a few minutes to believe it was real, but my suspension was gone, he had the admin flair, and clicking it led me to his account. So I posted a couple shitposts about the whole thing before posting that last thing that aedeos linked. The other two users were unbanned shortly after, and one of them claimed he didn't get a personal message from spez. I guess throughout this whole thing I didn't realize anything abnormal was going on.\n\nSo for the people asking: no, I don't know for sure that spez himself personally suspended me, but I know he personally reversed my suspension. If you have any more questions feel free to ask!",

Here we go\n\n>This first one is straight up fact checked and debunked by Snopes right here https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-laziness-is-a-trait-in-blacks/ \n\n>Christ now I gotta debunk every single thing in this second link? Darn. Thankfully most of it was really easy\n\n>1973- literally the only thing you have in Trump, and it happened 45 years ago. Just a few years after the Jim Crowe laws were lifted\n\n>1980s- there\u2019s nothing else in this, its an accusation, there is zero proof of this. It, like the rape allegations are most likely false\n\n>1988- He accused a country of stripping the US of our economic dignity, just because they\u2019re a different race than him doesn\u2019t make it racist, he coulda said it about fucking England\n\n>1989- So it\u2019s racist because they were black? The hell? He can\u2019t just not be convinced of something? My God, if they were white it wouldn\u2019t have changed. No evidence of it being racist, especially considering that they already had been accused of crimes in the past \n\n>1991- https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-laziness-is-a-trait-in-blacks/ conjecture \n\n>1992- racist because they were black? A high roller comes into your casino, you want to make fucking room for them. Now, you really shouldn\u2019t do that morally but it isn\u2019t racist\n\n>1993- I know Mexicans that don\u2019t look Mexican, they even say it. That\u2019s by definition NOT RACISM\n\n>2000- So now claiming a group of people have a criminal record is racist because they aren\u2019t white?\n\n>2004- That\u2019s not racist at all, he told the guy he\u2019s incredibly talented academically but he hasn\u2019t done anything with it, oh but he was black so it\u2019s racist \n\n>2005- Objectively not racist, it would be racist to the group of whites as well no?\n\n>2010- Yes, the people blowing other people up are mostly Muslims, get over it\n\n>2011a- Not racist, Trump didn\u2019t believe Obama was American, he woulda said the same if Obama was white\n\n>2011b- Trump heard Obama was a terrible student, that\u2019s NOT FUCKING RACIST\n\n>Now onto the third link, there\u2019s literally zero evidence of him saying this as evidenced here https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theatlantic.com/amp/article/567508/\n\n>This fourth one...there\u2019s nothing on this either way. It\u2019s he said she said bullshit and there isn\u2019t an ounce of evidence. Based off the lack of proof for the previous stuff I\u2019m gonna say it\u2019s safe to assume this is fake as well\n\n>Fifth one is more of the same j proven bullshit that of course just happened to come out at the time of his campaign \n\n>Sixth one is debunked with the same source I used for the third link. Nice job!\n\n>This seventh one is hilariously stupid. Trump eliminated someone from the apprentice because he was \u201can unbelievably talented guy in terms of education, and you haven\u2019t done anything,\u201d Trump said on the show. \u201cAt some point you have to say \u2018That\u2019s enough.'\u201d\n\n>Are you fucking retarded?\n\n>On to the eighth one! Wait...what? You\u2019re gonna have to explain to me how this one is even within the realm of racism\n\n>Number nine...I\u2019m getting really tired of this by the way. Blacks AND whites were forced to leave, what the fuck did you even read this and make sure it WASNT idiotic? \n\n>10...this one just says that Trump refuses certain women to compete in a beauty pageant...and some were black...but some were white...the fuck? You are awful at this\n\n>Eleven. WHAT?! DID. YOU. RESEARCH THIS? https://mashable.com/2016/03/01/black-students-ejected-donald-trump-rally/\n\n>Twelve. Being disruptive and swearing will get you removed. Has nothing to do with race. He\u2019s removed plenty of people before\n\n>Thirteen. And immediately sent him back after finding that out\n\n>Fourteen. https://www.npr.org/2017/08/14/543477490/racism-is-evil-trump-denounces-the-kkk-neo-nazis-and-white-supremacists\n\n>Fifteen. These guys were literally called white supremacists for saying that white privilege is fake\n\n>Now sit the fuck down, you were in over your head anyway\n\n\n>EDIT: As you can see from his replies, he had no intention of arguing in good faith, he posted a link that I fucking destroyed, then he tried to blow it off and use whatever failsafe he could to save his ass.

I built it myself and it\u2019s predator proofed for anything short of a Bear.\n\nOccasionally wild animals will come and investigate the smell of either my bird or the food and then move on when they realize they can\u2019t get in.  There has been one single animal that keeps coming back time after time after time simply to harass my bird and scare him, and that\u2019s some neighbors Russian Blue Cat that they let free roam the neighborhood.\n\nCountless times have I stumbled upon this cat trying to get into my enclosure, he always comes back and he always scares my bird.  I\u2019ve literally found him clinging to the outside of the cage like Spider-Man 4 feet off the ground trying to swat by bird while he\u2019s on his perch set a few inches back from the barrier.  Multiple times a week, for years on end this cat keeps coming back.  My bird is safe from him in his enclosure, but there\u2019s a tenacity there and a bored persistence that you just don\u2019t see with the wild animals of the neighborhood.\n\nI hate that cat, I hate it because it makes my bird who belongs on my property live on terror every day.  But it\u2019s not the cats fault, it\u2019s his terrible owners fault for setting him loose on the neighborhood with no regard for the native wildlife or other people pets.  Their cat shouldn\u2019t even be free roaming here for its own safety, we have Coyotes and Bobcats in droves, I\u2019m honestly surprised they haven\u2019t picked it off already.\n\nNo one has any right to just set their animals lose on the neighborhood around them, if you want to take your animal outside either train and supervise it or create a safe space where you can leave it unattended, no exceptions.  If a dog did what this cat does to me on a daily basis, it wouldn\u2019t be tolerated and it would be seen as a danger to the community.

            "So, I've been thinking about this stuff a lot recently. I just moved out of an apartment where I roomed with a communist and a Marxist-Leninist (I'm Dem Soc.) My experience from living and talking to them was that as we got closer and they trusted me more, the less defensive of the Holodomor, ethnic cleansing of Uyghurs, etc. It started with the tankie-lite stuff of \"Oh, the stats were overblown by Western media\" and \"People focus on this rather than the famine in Bengal.\" By the end, they were dressing down the statism of the Soviet Union, talking about white supremacy in the USSR, PR of China's support of the Khmer Rouge, etc. \n\nI think a lot of where the tankyism originates is from a sort of defense of the ideology/political theory that they believe in. When people go after communism, they go to these atrocities over and over and over again. And while it's not only right but NECESSARY to criticize those atrocities, everyone does it, including some people with much less genuine/valid political motives. Look at American conservative propaganda against politicians like AOC and Bernie Sanders. They aren't communists, but their policy proposals are dressed up by Foxx News and Breitbart as an American \"Great Leap Forward.\" The Soviet Union, China, and Cuba are all used as boogeymen to scare voters away from very moderate social democratic policy changes.\n\nSo, communists in this environment are put on the defensive. And the atrocities committed by authoritarian communist states in the 20th century become a  sort of red flag (as in a warning) to them. Is this person going to faithfully analyze political theory that I subscribe to or do they post Pinochet's helicopter memes? By the time that comrades of any leftist stripes voice their concerns that, for example, a majority white socialist country committed genocide against at least 1.3 million Kazakh peasants, communists are already socialized in the mindset that if you aren't a reactionary then you are at the very least aiding them in anti-communist propaganda efforts.\n\nAnd just in case anyone misunderstands, I want to wrap this Ted Talk up with a clarification. This isn't a sort of \"the reactionaries forced them to love the Holodomor\" argument. Rather, it's a pipeline of sorts that leftists, specifically those who follow ideologies that were represented in the \"2nd World,\" go down. The defensiveness is only the beginning of a political evolution that ends with the bootlicking dogshit that you see in the linked drama above. It's almost a political-cultural institution in the online left at this point. You enter a communist and exit as a nationalist, pro-police, authoritarian with socialist characteristics.",

            "This almost always happens when a group of heterosexual males find the gay guy in their group and they all get super creepy and start sexually assaulting them. Broom, hockey sticks, coat hangers. Gay people are very well aware of this to the point where it\u2019s a part of our culture to watch out for this stuff. \n\nMost people like to deflect it and pretend \u201coh, they must all have been gay or something\u201d but it\u2019s absolutely not that. An entire gang, a group of 9 people in America once discovered that one of their members was gay, so they spent 6 hours laughing sadistically while shoving a baseball bat up the gay guys rectum and torturing him for half a day. What are the chances ALL 9 members were all secretly gay, randomly formed a gang and then tortured the one guy who was outed. This isn\u2019t just a military thing but happens in high schools, where the perpetrators are genuinely confused as to why people are so shocked when this happens because, hey...the guy is a weak bitch and deserves it. If they can\u2019t find the gay guy in a group, then they\u2019ll have to find a substitute and many heterosexuals end up finding themselves as targets for this stuff as well. This just goes to show you when straight guys see gay sex, they see it through the eyes of a misogynist: some conquerer humiliating and defeating their target: women. So, when they see gay sex, they just laugh at the idea of a guy who willingly degrades himself to the position of a woman because sex is about destruction, humiliation and cruelty..which is why they have such a fucked up view of gay people as basically  satanists instead of imagining 2 gay guys having a picnic together. \n\n",

That in insense could be considered the meaning of \u201cRape Culture\u201d. Am i almost correct?",

            "What astonished me about this debacle is that Shapiro tweeted after the recording (presumably for damage control purposes) and stated that he didn't know who Neil was.\n\nNow, that's fair, we can't expect him to know who every journalist and political commentator is - but Andrew Niel is a very high profile conservative commentator. He's the editor of The Spectator which is a widely recognised and well respected conservative magazine, he's worked at the beeb- both as a journo and a commentator/host- for a really long time. The BBC do not, as a rule, softball in political interviews and Andrew Niel particularly so. \n\nShapiro just had to Google him to find all this stuff out about him, it would have taken less than 10 minutes - I'm assuming hes got a PA who could have even done it for him. I have no idea why you would appear for an interview thats going to be so widely broadcasted so woefully underprepared, so totally unable to answer a single question.\n\nI've heard of Shapiro but not really paid any attention to him, but I was aware that he was  quite famous as a conservative/right wing thinker, debater and speaker - it's a damning indictment on the state of political discourse in the US if he really is amongst their best and brightest. \n\nChrist on a bike.",

The biggest factor was the fact that, when we would do an official DMCA takedown of an image, almost immediately afterwards users would find a new image host to repost the image. In addition, many of these images were of the underage celebrities, which violates rule four of the site, \"no...sexually suggestive content featuring minors.\" We understand that the moderators did the best they could with the situation at hand, but having users purposefully try and circumvent the takedowns was starting to become a whack-a-mole game. Heck, one user even stated explicitly that they were going to make a point of rehosting the images on other image hosts because they were being removed because of DMCA takedown requests. In addition to that, other users were rehosting the images on pay-per-click sites and sites that spread malware (which resulted in bans of many domains and users). These factors led us to decide that the subreddit and many of its sister-subreddits were in violation of rule five of the site, \"don't...do anything that interferes with normal use of the site.\" The demand for that particular material actually caused access issues with the site at times.\n",

        "selftext": "#Background\n\nr/Cryptocurrency has, along with r/Fortnite, been a part of the Reddit Community Points Experiment. The subreddit users and moderators are rewarded for their contributions with Moons, a Cryptocurrency token. Although officially this token has no value, and buying or selling it is currently against Reddit TOS, the token can be bought and sold on various black market exchanges, and has a current value of just under 12 cents on CoinGecko. This has led to a great deal of controversies on r/Cryptocurrency, and a sister subreddit, r/LazyMoons, was established to document all the drama and scandals pertaining to this experiment.\n\nA few days ago, an r/LazyMoons user discovered and documented evidence that an r/Cryptocurrency moderator had sold 60,000+ moons over a six month period via these black market exchanges, and netted a profit of more than 10,000 USD. This is against Reddit terms of service, and may also specifically be against moderator conduct guidelines, which dictate that no moderator can be paid for their work. Here is the original post:\n\n#Original Post\n\n> Please view the screenshots [attached](https://imgur.com/a/Bfru4e8) for Records of Transactions totalling in excess of 60,000 MOONs sent to Celesti Swap, between early August 2021 and early January 2022, from a single account: part time r/cryptocurrency moderator McGillby.\n\n> During the same six month period, McGillby has made a total of 45 visible actions in his capacity as a moderator of r/Cryptocurrency. Approximately 0.24 per day. Less than one visible action every four days.\n\n> This works out to 1,333.33 moons SOLD for every single visible moderator action.\n\n> If we give moons an approximate average value of 15 cents throughout this six month period (which I actually think is quite conservative), this equates to a total of 9000 USD in sales. \n\n> Approximately $200 for every visible mod action.\n\n> By my reckoning this qualifies him for the title of the Single Most Successful Lazy Moon Farmer in r/Cryptocurrency History.\n\n> Such is the generosity of the r/Cryptocurrency mod team's allocation of moons from each distribution, he still has 140,000 moons ready to dump on the market.\n\n#Subsequent Events\n\nThe post generated a lot of interest and became the second most upvoted post of all time on r/LazyMoons, and attracted a lot of comments also, including comments by r/Cryptocurrency moderators. The post was deleted several days later, along with a number of other historical posts and comments that were critical of r/Cryptocurrency moderators or directly referred to them selling their Reddit Community Points (against Reddit TOS). There was a lot of confusion about who was responsible and who is currently in control of the subreddit, as documented in this thread.\n\n https://www.reddit.com/r/LazyMoons/comments/shv2ja/who_currently_controls_rlazymoons_and_how_an/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share\n\nIt appears the subreddit has fallen into the hands of a new user account, with absolutely no history on Reddit, except for being made moderator of r/LazyMoons a few days ago.\n\nThe new moderator gave very suspicious answers when asked why he was deleting content and banning users, [that certainly have no basis in reality.](https://imgur.com/a/caqdCUT) The new regime at r/LazyMoons have set the subreddit so that every new post has to be approved by moderators before being published. They have also changed the official subreddit rules so that posts pertaining to moderators selling their moons can't be posted anywhere except r/CryptoCurrencyMeta (a subreddit they control).\n\nDid r/Cryptocurrency moderators (or someone who is unfathomably sympathetic to their cause) just execute a hostile takeover of another subreddit, for the sole purpose of censoring discussion surrounding them violating Reddit TOS by selling their Reddit Comminity Points for cash?  If not them, then who?\n\n#Update \n\nThe mysterious new moderator who seized control of the subreddit made a post [announcing the new rules.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LazyMoons/comments/sipt6n/there_is_a_new_sheriff_in_town/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\n\nA long term and well-respected user of the sub replied [calling them out and explicitly accused them of being an r/Cryptocurrency mod trying to censor discussion of this.](https://imgur.com/a/n6o3BXm)\n\nAll of those comments have now been [deleted.](https://imgur.com/a/N436PLz)\n\n#Update 2\n\nThis is a developing situation and there are a lot of moving parts, but the subreddit r/LazyMoons has wrestled back control from the dark forces that sought to subvert and subjugate it, as detailed [in this thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LazyMoons/comments/siupr0/psa_normal_service_has_been_resumed/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) We remain extremely bewildered as to who tried to take over the subreddit, and why.\n\nThe mysterious moderator who seized control of the subreddit, u/Lazy_Mod, has deleted their entire post and comment history.\n\nThe original post that led to all this drama is back up.\n\n^they ^have ^the ^plant ^but ^we ^have ^the ^power",

Fearful of having the main sub banned, we removed discussion on trading moons and links to the sites where you can trade moons, with an automoderator message stating \"Trading of Moons is against Reddit's TOS\" which, I think, it was. Alongside the bit that said \"Reddit Community Points have no value\"  \n\nBut anyway  \n\nReddit has decided to expand RCP's to more subs, and produced new documentation, which states:  \n\n> \u201dYou can create custom tools for Community Points in novel ways because they are based on the ERC-20 Ethereum standard. For example, you can accept Points as proof of Reddit reputation on your site, create private spaces for Points holders, or accept Points in exchange for goods and services.\"   \n\nThis makes it sound a little more acceptable to trade moons.  \n\nThe simple mistake here was that the moderator(s) responsible for updating the Automoderator message didn't, possibly because Reddit Admins, when questioned directly, were still being a little obtuse on what the rules were pertaining users buying/selling moons.  \n\n\nAnd that's it. If mods are choosing to sell their moons and get shitcanned for it by Reddit then that's on them. If users do the same, then that's on them. If people hold moons in private wallets and then Reddit moves to mainnet and those moons are incompatible and worthless, that's on them too. That's how I interpret the rules.",

Think of all the news about news we\u2019ve had: the new obsession over Fake News, plus constant reports on Trump\u2019s interactions with media (Trump and CNN\u2019s Latest Feud just last week, or how he refused to attend the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner, or whatever his latest tweets about Fox are, or how news media are under attack). \n\nThis latest event is basically WaPo reporting about how they were in the progress of reporting on news when a Fake News media tried to get them to report on Fake News in revenge for WaPo\u2019s original efforts to report on Real News. Or something. That interview video they posted of two reporters (well one reporter and one \u2018reporter\u2019) trying to interview one another was like watching some ouroboros power struggle for Truth Dominance.

My support for Donald Trump (the god emperor of the united states) never wavered. I just wanted to take this opportunity to start an honest conversation about a very serious and very real topic. That topic is the continued irrational downvoting of trump supporter posts in a subreddit created solely for the opinions of those supporters. And before you get all mad about all of the awards and reddit premium you guys gave me and bought me, consider this an offset for all the illegitimate downvotes I've received in the past. Especially the ones on my Hillary Clinton is a skank post, which by the way, we all know is totally true.\n\nNow let's be honest, Scarborough DID murder his intern that he was having an affair with. The medical examiner who performed the autopsy on the body of the victim is known for making fraudulent statements on autopsy reports and his medical license was revoked. He was also arrested for storing human body parts in a Florida storage unit. He was also fired in 2003 for not completing autopsy reports. He was also fired as a contract medical examiner in 1996 in Missouri in a dispute over his caseload and autopsy reports. This is when his license was revoked. All the stored body parts came from private autopsies performed (likely without a medical license as it had been revoked). I'd be willing to bet the autopsy of Lori Klausutis was also a paid private autopsy done without a valid medical license.\n\nWe shouldn't be censoring tweets from anybody (including the president), everybody has a right to their opinion. We shouldn't try to be like China, even if they do contribute millions of dollars to Reddit. My rights shouldn't end where your feelings begin.\n\nAlso Seth Rich was murdered, Bill Clinton is a rapist, and Joe Biden is a sexual predator.\n\nPS. I also used the free week of premium that I got for this post and checked out r/lounge, and it's the BIGGEST waste of time I've ever seen. I can't believe anybody pays money for THAT. Also go ahead and change me back to nimble navigator please. Additionally we had an inside bet on how long it would take to receive a gold award. Our guess was within 10 minutes.

In our youth our hearts were touched with fire. *Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.*\n\nThe Fattening. The Red(dit) Wedding. The June Purge. Little Pao's First Pogrom. The events of June 10 and June 11, 2015 will be many things to many people. But to those who lived through it, who fought on battlelines soaked periwinkle with downvotes, those events will always be only one thing: the greatest dramatic happening in a tumultuous nine years of Reddit's existence. A roiling incident, a supreme disquiet, a riot that pitted Redditor against Redditor, brother against brother, and changed the very fabric of Reddit's existence, possibly for an entire couple months. \n\nIt saw heroes rise, and fall. It saw unlikely allies, and all too familiar villains. It saw fighting in all places, from the bustling hub of /r/all, to the smoky backrooms of the metasphere, to the quaint, quiet serenity of /r/koans. On one side: the idea that harassment should not be tolerated. On the other: the idea that free speech is a right inalienable, to be protected despite the consequences.\n\nIt was the Fattening. \n\nIt was an actual thing that happened.\n\nThe root causes of the Fattening are vast and myriad: the backlash against SJWs, GamerGate, the Tumblr/Reddit Cold War, [the Imgur vs Fat People Hate debacle](https://np.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/394p6c/about_an_hour_ago_imgur_started_deleting_images/), all were powder kegs leading to the eventual explosion. \n\nThis recap will focus only on the events that occurred during the Fattening, and will leave speculation to the brave, future historians. The brave, and the kind of sad and a little pathetic future historians who study the Fattening and it's later repercussions.\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nIt began with [an announcement:](http://np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/39bpam/removing_harassing_subreddits/) henceforth, the Reddit administration would be banning subreddits that engaged in behavior that violated [Reddit's new harassment policy,](http://www.redditblog.com/2015/05/promote-ideas-protect-people.html?m=1) however nebulously defined. Five subreddits were banned: hamplanethatred, transfags, neofag, shitniggerssay, and, most importantly of all: /r/fatpeoplehate, a sub with 150,000 subscribers strong.\n\nThe reaction was instant, shooting like a musket ball across the whole of Reddit. Users of all walks of life spoke quickly and loudly of censorship and oppression. Other users decried the response as feeble and wondered why other subreddits, most notably ShitRedditSays and CoonTown, were not similarly banned. Battle lines were being marked and drawn. The air sizzled electric with the possibility of war.\n\nIn the early discussions on two subreddits, [KotakuInAction,](http://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/39bq9c/censorship_the_new_age_of_reddit_has_begun_admins/) and [Conspiracy,](https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/39bq32/rfatpeoplehate_has_been_banned/) we see the first signs of smoke, a prophecy of fire, wild and hot, inconsolable. Users felt fatpeoplehate deserved the ban and that little of value was lost. Many others, however, felt the subreddit had a fundamental right to speak as it saw fit. To the latter group, this was political correctness gone wild. And not the good gone wild, like /r/gonewild. The bad kind. The kind that doesn't involve naked women.\n\n/r/fatlogic, the fatpeoplehate sister subreddit immediately went private (it is back as of right now). In threads across the Fempire, there was unanimous celebration, [ShitRedditSays](http://np.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/39bqyc/meta_the_cabal_scores_a_major_victory_as/), most notably. Users spilled ink at a feverish rate. In /r/legaladvice, users wondered about [legal recourse,](http://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/39c58h/could_someone_sue_reddit_for_banning_and/) but were summarily rebuffed. Entire essays extolling the virtues of free speech and decrying administrative oppression were hastily penned and published, their authors gilded. To some they were merely hilarious copypasta, to others they were the manifesto of a revolution.\n\nAnd then there was war.\n\nIn the wake of the banning, alternative fat people hate subreddits spread like wildfire across a dry, Kansas prairie. Fatpeoplehate 2-9, fatpersonhate, ObesityRules, CandidHealthPolice, and many others all vied to replace fatpeoplehate as the center of anti-fat sentiments. All were quashed by the administration, banned outright, and relegated to the dregs of the Reddit's cache, never to be seen again. [Their mods were shadowbanned](http://np.reddit.com/r/ObesePeopleDislike/comments/39ddx6/all_mods_of_this_sub_have_been_shadowbanned/) and their users scattered and in disarray.\n\nAs all wars, this one, too, effected both innocent and guilty. /r/whalewatching, a two year old sub dedicated to watching whales, was over run by anti-fat posts, leading to it being [briefly banned, then reinstated.](http://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/39g65l/reddit_bans_rwhalewatching_thinking_its_a_clone/cs373xh)\n\nWhat happened next was an unprecedented outpouring of upvotes. Users regrouped, taking the battle to the defaults themselves. /r/Pics found itself awash in anti-fat activity, all pictures deriding fat people immediately and consistently upvoted, skyrocketing these posts to the top /r/all. Eventually the mods of /r/pics, despite reservations, [banned all FPH related posts.](https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/39dp92/rpics_is_being_flooded_with_obesity_related_posts/)\n\nMajor news outlets across the world now began to take notice, and word of the revolt bled into the real world. A list of those articles can be found [here.](https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/39dp92/rpics_is_being_flooded_with_obesity_related_posts/)\n\nBut then the war took a turn. Feeling lost and hopeless against the onslaught of administrative and moderator action, fat people haters took up arms and went after that very administration, most notably it's leader and figure-head, Ellen Pao. /r/punchablefaces [went private](https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/39g8me/punchablefaces_mod_deletes_all_ellen_paorelated/) after hundreds of pictures expressing the desire to punch Pao right in the face were upvoted by protestors. Two out of three mods were shadowbanned, losing their karma and any remaining gold months forever.\n\nFrom that wellspring, a flood of anti-Pao sentiments began. Pao hate subs flourished on /r/all. Insults, threats, requests for Pao to resign all stood stalwart on the top of /r/all. [One post](https://np.reddit.com/r/PaoMustResign/comments/39fqht/upvote_this_buy_no_gold_until_pao_resigns/) requesting users not gild posts in protest was gilded over two dozen times.\n\nThe war had reached a fever pitch, holding hostage the very website on which it was being waged. All were now embroiled in it, and none could escape. In little /r/koans, a moderator also took up arms. Although his subreddit was a small, almost private, endeavor, he henceforth [tendered his resignation.](https://np.reddit.com/r/Koans/comments/39flst/i_respectfully_resign_from_rkoans/) The Fattening was inescapable.\n\nBut although a candle that burns at both ends burns twice as bright, so too does it burn twice as fast. Exhausted from outrage, from fighting, from war, users began to abandon the front late June 11, 2015. The most embroiled and passionate users fled what they believed to be persecution by the hundreds. Voat.co, a Reddit alternative that promised freer speech and less oversight, was so overrun that it's servers crashed. Users in 4 and 8chan were turned away at the gates. Yet shouts of \"This is the Digg migration part 2!\" echoed in comments everywhere.\n\nIn gaming subreddits, talk of the Steam Sale began to peak through top posts like the first rays of sunlight after a dark and terrible storm. An actor had passed away. There were memes to make. Reddit had business as usual to tend to.\n\nAnd peace, long fought for, reigns again in sleepy subreddits across Reddit, although some [small embers of discontent](http://np.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplehate61/comments/39jis7/no_of_times_ellen_pao_does_anal_in_a_day/) still burn, threatening to emerge again like a revenant, haunting us all.\n\nWhat consequences does The Fattening hold? What results will follow? Was this the petulant bleating of so many man-children? The tantrum of a child who has his toys taken by his parents? Or was it something more? Something grander? A fundamental shift in the discourse on the Internet, perhaps, or the portents of a rise of a new \"Front Page of the Internet\"?\n\nOnly time will tell.\n\n>Mah dearest Annabelle,\n\n>These last many days I have kept the memory of you close to my bosom. The cursed Fat Haters who have harassed us lo these many months were delivered a mighty blow. However, their fury has spread wide and fight has been exceedingly buttery but I am certain of victory though it may be ever so long in the fighting. The Admin corps is resolute and stand proudly.

Users gathered around their great buttery tubs, their mouths agape as General Pao gathered her SJW brownshirts, and corporate shilling carpetbaggers and struck straight at the heart of freedom and liberty. When the dust cleared it appeared as if victory was at hand, but lo then upon the horizon were a rag tag group of subs, trained in the art of guerilla warfare and harden by years of narcissism and culture war. The battle cries rang out \"REMEMBER GAMERGATE!\" \"REMEMBER /R/JAILBAIT!\" \"HITLER WASN'T WRONG!\" and bearing the misappropriated battle standard of Aaron Schwartz they threw back the forces of darkness- for a time. Their attacks were unconventional, some might say utterly asinine and immature, but they proved their willingness to fight, to make utter fools of themselves to a man, to be complete assholes to strangers on the internet.

People have seen how fucking ridiculous these people are, even at r/adviceanimals they don't want to know anything about them right now. Nothing could have been more effective in showing how little respect these assholes deserve, and I wouldn't be surprised if in a couple months everyone who was on their side is too ashamed to admit they actually defended these guys.

They won't be able to go back to that lie, which is nice. \n\nIDK, reddit has shown the lack of self-awareness and self-criticism it has again and again, but after this huge tantrum I wouldn't be surprised if things change a bit for the better in this shithole. \n\nBTW, I'll see you all goddamn SJWs at the cabal party tonight!

But e[ver since Mayor Porridge was elected](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rabbits/comments/w4bo19/newly_elected_mayor_porridge_starts_crying_during/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), he has torn this community apart. There is a co-ordinated propaganda campaign to cover up the crimes of the Mayor & his lackeys.\n\nExamples:\n\n* [Mayor Porridge was arrested for reckless binkying](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rabbits/comments/w6z4s9/breaking_news_mayor_porridge_gets_arrested_for/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) (a special jump rabbits do when happy, although knowing Mayor Porridge he was likely high on raspberries).

However, construction has faced consistent delays and is already overbudget.

For example, [\"Mayor Porridge, when asked about the effects of his train project on the economy, responds 'What's an economy?'\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rabbits/comments/wafc33/mayor_porridge_asked_about_the_effects_of_his/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n* Mayor Porridge has colluded with the Police Force to cover up his crimes. Shortly after his arrest, Sheriff Cub released a statement: \"[His head may be empty, but his heart is in the right place](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rabbits/comments/w8clpg/breaking_mayor_porridge_released_from_sitting_in/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\".

            "As someone with an actual degree in this topic, let me put to bed exactly how stupid it is for anyone to think it is unreasonable to view Salah ad-Din in a positive light. \n\nSalah ad-Din was used in **contemporary European** writings, legends, songs, plays, etc *as the model by which all chivalrous knights should conduct themselves*. Balking at him being portrayed in a positive light compared to Crusaders shows a historical ignorance that goes well beyond forgivable into outright willful and reeks of bigotry being used to shade an anti-historical and indefensible interpretation of events.\n\nFor Christ's sake, the First Crusades began with the massacre of the Rhineland where they mass murdered Jews and that was *the least* of the atrocities committed. \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhineland_massacres\n\nThe Albigensian Crusades were issued to commit literal genocide against people for being the wrong kind of Christian, and this started less than 10 years after Salah ad-Din died so these were contemporary Christians of his time, the same people he fought against, committing literal genocide against other Christians whereas Salah ad-Din showed nothing but mercy to those same people\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albigensian_Crusade\n\n\n\nHere's a five second google search that even this dipshit could've done:\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saladin\n\n>Saladin eventually achieved a great reputation in Europe as a chivalrous knight, due to his fierce struggle against the crusaders and his generosity. In The Divine Comedy he is mentioned as one of the virtuous non-Christians in limbo,[124] and he is also depicted favorably in Boccaccio's The Decameron.[125\n\n>Despite the Crusaders' slaughter when they originally conquered Jerusalem in 1099, Saladin granted amnesty and free passage to all common\u00a0[Catholics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholics)\u00a0and even to the defeated Christian army, as long as they were able to pay the aforementioned ransom (the\u00a0[Greek Orthodox](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church)\u00a0Christians were treated even better, because they often opposed the western Crusaders).\n\n\n>Notwithstanding the differences in beliefs, the Muslim Saladin was respected by Christian lords, Richard especially. Richard once praised Saladin as a great prince, saying that he was without doubt the greatest and most powerful leader in the Islamic world.[127] Saladin in turn stated that there was not a more honorable Christian lord than Richard. After the treaty, Saladin and Richard sent each other many gifts as tokens of respect but never met face to face. \n\n>In April 1191, a Frankish woman's three-month-old baby had been stolen from her camp and sold on the market. The Franks urged her to approach Saladin herself with her grievance. According to Bah\u0101' al-D\u012bn, Saladin used his own money to buy the child back: \"He gave it to the mother and she took it; with tears streaming down her face, and hugged the baby to her chest. The people were watching her and weeping and I (Ibn Shaddad) was standing amongst them. She suckled it for some time and then Saladin ordered a horse to be fetched for her and she went back to camp.[128][129]\"",

            "Stepping aside from the Crusades and the (pseudo)history surrounding them for just a second, I find it so fucking RICH that this chud's rationale for this hypothetical Christian revival is against \"censorship\". No one has perpetrated more censorship and moral panic over \"degenerate\" and \"filthy\" media than the christ-fellating moral puritans who have this nation by the balls.\n\nHe must have committed a \"sin of omission\" since he conviently forgot the anti-video game moral panic from the mid-2000s. When social conservatives scare-mongered about how any child who played GTA was being brainwashed and predestined to become the next Columbine killer, and the PT Cruiser-driving Karens of America lapped up every word. (To be fair there were several centrist / moderate / \"brunch\" liberals from the beltway who engaged in this moral crusade of hollow virtue signaling too.) \n\nIn this chode's utopia, his precious AoE II discs would be crushed under a bonehead's jackboot. The objective of religious theocracy has always been the policing of individual human rights. Obviously this is already the case in Islamic theocracies, and Christians should give them more credit in seeking to emulate them. It is pleasing to God that His minions infiltrate government to abuse people, and then they cry persecution when people see through their delusions. Anyone who's taken psychology 101 will identify this as \"projection\". This term really describes so much of Christian apologetics in the 21st century. They were the inventors of cancel culture. \n\nI think I'll play my next Skirmish as Saracens vs. Vikings and Teutons on Scandinavia just to spite him.",

He literally didn't give a shit about the religious pretext, and neither did the Seljuks.  The Seljuks weren't conquering \"the holy land\" in some zealous jihad.  They were conquering \"the holy land\" because that's what medieval kingdoms did.  They conquered territory.\n\nLike, Ironically, do you know how the Seljuks conquered Antioch?

            "Depending on which period ia in question, it boils down to the Crusaders not keeping any truces, or agreements. This wasn't something that grow over time, the 1st Crusaders were awful for ignoring agreements. For instance they had an agreement with Emperor Alexius Komnenos that any land they conquered that was originally Byzantine went to him, any new land was to be split between him and the Crusader leaders.\n\nThey had disagreements about this, see the Siege of Nicaea, as the Crusaders didn't really care about just reclaiming land, they wanted to eradicate anyone in those cities, and a city is a worthless place if everyone is dead, the one exception I can recall at the moment is when the Crusading armies actually got to Jerusalem, they slaughtered everyone, one leader, tancred I believe, left his flag with a group in a holy building in an attempt to saving them, on his return he found nothing but corpses, in the Gesta Francorum it is written 'the slaughter was so great that our men waded in blood up to their ankles'. All sieges in this period were bloody, but this seems to have been a premeditated purge of all non-christians, this includes the Jews not just the Muslims, as some were allowed to leave on the promise of never returning. The Byzantines had already dropped support for the Crusade as the Crusaders had been way to much to deal with and they had ignored the oath they took to Alexius.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, both sides were horrific by our standards to say one side is better than the other doesn't work, but the concept of trust worthy Crusaders is comical, they were utterly irreprehensible in their actions, driven by greed, a blind faith that they took to the extreme, the possibility of having a pardon and passage to heaven.\n\nI am aware I'm talking about the First Crusade, rather than the Third Crusade, 1189 - 1192, but the Crusaders were a force that was aimed in a general direction away from yourself and released. But if you want a better understand of the treachery and greediness of the Crusaders I seriously suggest you look at the First Crusade, and how one leader intentionally never took an oath to the Emperor, how another usurped a whole kingdom to become the next in line, how the Sunni and Shia Muslims played the Crusaders against each other, and just why the idea of another Crusade was such a bad idea for Europe, the amount of damage the Crusaders caused in the European area before they even left is a great read and it does help show why many leaders were awfully cautious around calling for another Crusade.",

An army from Europe shows up for the THIRD FUCKING TIME, and demand that you vacate your turf.\n\nAlso, Saladin, during the 3rd Crusade, was OBJECTIVELY a better person than his opponents. He sent doctors when Richard and Philip got sick (which was often), he fed his opponents' representatives during one of several parlays (there's no evidence that Richard and Saladin ever met), he returned captives. Oh yeah, and he DIDN'T slaughter civilians; Richard had a WHOLE FUCKING TOWN beheaded, one at a time.\n\nSaladin also had some pretty convincing evidence that God was on his side. Besides Richard and Philip getting ridiculously sick a lot (Philip got sick enough that he had to peace out back to France), the German Emperor Frederick (the first, I think?) fucking fell off his horse and *drowned* while on his way through Asia Minor so the German army never arrived. Also, when King Richard had WON, literally within sight of Jerusalem with an army at his back and Saladin nowhere to be found...he *inexplicably fucked off and never came within sight of Jerusalem again.* Finally, on his way back home, Richard was captured and held for ransom by the German and Austrian Kings (a Henry and a Lepold, I believe).

This bullshit tantrum over responsibility for shitty behavior seems like the same whining we already endured all the way back in the early 1990s with being \"politically correct.\" \n\nIt's the same damn concept: if you're going to express prejudice, hatred, and/or hostility towards an entire collection of people for their religious affiliations, race, gender, sexuality, income level, etc in a public venue, (social media) then you can expect people in PUBLIC to hold them accountable to their friends, family, colleagues, contacts, and etc for that behavior. \n\nSocial media - twitter, YouTube, Facebook, etc aren't some kind of clandestine venues where you can say whatever and the world is supposed to pretend that it has no connection to the person IRL. \n\nHow can they exploit social media to invade and infest the awareness of their targets of harassment and then demand that such actions have no impact on their reality?

One of their promises early on was that their employees would never be put under a 'crunch' cycle. A 'crunch' in the workplace is effectively setting the employees into overdrive. Long hours, More often than not, working over 100 hours a weeks for six to seven days. Usually, this is done just before a game or piece of software is to be released. Sometimes, the employees are not even paid for this. However, CD Projekt Red has promised (they won't break this one, ok) to reimburse employees for the extra hours worked, which *technically* speaking doesn't make it crunch in the eyes of many people because they are being compensated for their work.\n\nDespite the common circlejerk on reddit that gamers wish to dab on the workers for an early release, most of r/pcgaming and even the thread on r/CyberpunkGame (the biggest one, although there is plenty of apologia there too) agrees that this is hypocrisy, lies and betrayal. Disturbed from the previous statements broken such as the 'no microtransactions' and its splitting-hairs issue with their separate multiplayer game, sceptics conflict with die hard fans over whether its moral.\n\n[\"but CDPR is different\" a song reddit looves to sing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/j293on/cd_projekt_red_is_breaking_their_promise_of_no/g743nzm/)\n\n[User argues for unions, is hit with why unions bad](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/j293on/cd_projekt_red_is_breaking_their_promise_of_no/g745j4b/)\n\n[**Naughty Dog:** Announces mandatory crunch **Redditors:** \"Absolutely disgusting behavior\" **CD Project Red:** Says they won't crunch, but backtracks and announces mandatory crunch. **Redditors:** \"B-b-but they're different!\"]\n(https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/j293on/cd_projekt_red_is_breaking_their_promise_of_no/g744dx6/)\n\n[Why should I care.

You come home to shower and sleep, and when you don't work weekends you're mentally drained and tired but you have to clean your house and do all the shit you couldn't do during the week. In the majority of cases you are payed a rate of \u00d71.2 or more, but if you're unlucky you're not even payed. Even when you're getting payed, it's poison money because if you just started your career and is in a vulnerable position (lots of juniors out there just fresh out of school would replace you in a heartbeat), you can't really say no to crunch. You don't want to lose your job at the end of the project, you don't want your \"work attitude\" being seeing negatively because there are rumors of people getting blacklisted from the industry and you have a student loan to pay. Some people get burned out after crunch, some get depressed and don't notice it, some people weather it like pros...it's not for everyone. But it's your job-passion.",

Each extra hour costs 1.5x your regular pay and if some on weekends or in the night time employeer need to pay 2x.\nAlso you need to have mandatory 11h break every day from work and 35h break every week.

Most white collar jobs don\u2019t unionize as much because the skill sets are often hard enough to come by that the employee tends to have enough leveraging power to bargain more with their employer since their skill set is hard to find. Part of the reason this keeps happening with gaming as an industry is because there\u2019s so many kids who aren\u2019t hearing these stories, thinking it\u2019s a privilege to work for these companies and not hearing about what their skills can actually get them, and when stories like these get published and gamers go on about how they\u2019re being \u201cwhiny\u201d isn\u2019t helping.",

I AM NOT SAYING CDPR WILL FALL LIKE BETHESDA, all I am saying is that you shouldn't make excuses like this, the world is not black and white, CDPR is not a pure-hearted company, not evil, obviously, but everyone has flaws, they are going to make mistakes, and if you look past them, they might (consciously or unconsciously) start making more mistakes",

So while long shoots do still occur, and are often necessary in a rush to do reshoots before release, workers get compensated for this kind of workload. The solution to this is unionization.",

Eventually though, after a number of years, he met a great woman. They moved in together and got married.\n\nLast year they had a virtual bris for their newborn son. I tuned in and noticed that he got fat. Not obese, but he got a big ol' belly going.\n\nAnd that just made me happy.

Almost a 2000% loss. Oh, and his account was closed.\n\nIt doesn't stop there, though. Around the same time, Robinhood (the app used to make these trades) sent an [email notification](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/agovgl/only_invest_what_you_can_afford_to_lose_they_said/ee8m8zm/) out to users that the trading strategy used by 1R0NYMAN was no longer being supported by the app, with a strong possibility that his loss was the direct cause.\n\nBut it gets more interesting. As the user WOW_SUCH_KARMA points out [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/agovgl/only_invest_what_you_can_afford_to_lose_they_said/ee8o6js/), Robinhood may be legally liable for the losses due to some of their actions / lack of actions. \n\nNow, the [entire](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/aha6f5/did_you_ever_hear_the_tragedy_of_u1r0nyman_the/) subreddit is [exploding](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ah0qqc/when_u1r0nyman_finds_out_rh_margin_trading/) with [memes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/agvpoh/it_do_be_like_that/) and [quality shitposts](https://gfycat.com/OnlyFeistyLabradorretriever) about the entire situation, and the latest news is that 1R0NYMAN has been [contacted by MarketWatch](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ah51pi/marketwatch_wants_in/), a stock market news site that may want to run a story about it all. \n\nWho knows where it'll go from here.\n\nEDIT: Because people keep asking, it's hard to get a firm understanding of what exactly happened without at least *some* knowledge of how options work, but [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/agvpoh/it_do_be_like_that/ee9z5qw/) is a good place to start for an ELI5.",

            "For those who don't understand, let me try very briefly:\n\nThere is a financial saying: \"picking up nickels in front of a steamroller\".  This refers to a wide variety of financial strategies where you make an immediate small profit by taking on the risk of a large or unlikely-to-happen event.\n\nSo, let's say you decide to sell insurance on the Empire State Building.  Your policy is this: \"If the Empire State Building burns down on July 9th, 2021, we will pay out the full value of the building. Otherwise this policy is worthless.\"\n\nSince it's pretty unlikely that that event will happen, you can't charge much for that insurance, let's say $5.  So you get $5 in cash immediately (picking up nickels). And as long as the ESB doesn't burn down on July 9th, 2021, that $5 was free money.  But what happens if it does?  You're ruined (steamroller hit you).\n\nYou can do this in a wide variety of contexts, with lots of different financial instruments.  The financial system has various rules to prevent naive people from making these bets as they tend to get flattened.  But sometimes loopholes are discovered.\n\nPoster thought he found a set of trades where he could pick up nickels without getting hit by the steamroller. Turned out he didn't see the steamroller coming and got run over.",

            "Here's a shot at ELI5.\n\nOptions trades are the \"option\" to buy (\"call\") or sell (\"put\") a stock at a pre agreed price. Their value depends on the value of the underlying stock. \n\nOP entered four different options trades that theoretically cancel each other out at any given price of the underlying stock. Theoretically, no matter what happened to the underlying stock, OP's four trades would offset each other and limit the risk to OP. \n\nAt the same time, based on the pricing of the options, OP made a little bit of money off of the four trades together, about $5 for each set of four trades. \n\nHowever, OP is trading in \"American options\", which means that the buyer of the option can choose to exercise the option at any time. The opposite of American options are \"European options\", which can only be exercised at the expiry date. \n\nThe underlying stock, UVXY, is trading at $55 and has been sliding for the last few weeks. Someone holding a $10 call option on UVXY (the right to buy at $10) has a very strong motivation to exercise the call option for $10, sell the share for $55, and walk away with a $45 profit, since they lose money if the share price falls farther. \n\nThis is what happened to OP. People holding OP's $10 call options started exercising them, which forces OP to exercise $15 call options to supply shares for the $10 call options, taking a loss of $5 per share. It also breaks the offsetting payouts in OP's option strategy, so OP's risk is no longer all that limited. \n\nThat leaves OP with only the put options that they bought/sold, which will pay out $0/share *at most*. If the share price is above $15 they are all out of the money and worth nothing. Below $10 OP loses $5/share. Between $10-15/share OP loses between $0-5/share. \n\nSo OP is making about $5 on each set of 4 options contracts they enter into. **But each options contract is for 100 shares.**, and OP is losing $5/share on the exercised call options, and stands to lose another $5/share on the put options. \n\nOP's strategy might have worked if they had been trading European options that couldn't be exercised early, however I can all but guarantee that the European options wouldn't be priced in a way that allowed OP to make any money (because that's how markets work).\n\n\n",

            "I understand why he made that trade considering like 5 people in both that thread and this thread actually understand what happened. Most of the explanations are either too advanced for a beginner or not correct.\n\nSo here's the ELI5 or maybe the ELIsomeonewhodoesntreallyknowstocksbutcanatleastdobasicmath.\n\n-------\nStock background:\n\nUVXY stock was worth like ~$60 per share at the time OP was doing all of this. Calls and puts are technically sold in quantities of 100 shares, but I\u2019m going to be talking about them as if they were single shares.\n\n-------\n\nCalls:\n\nOP sold an unknown person the right to buy 1 share of UVXY stock for $10 from him within the next two years for $56.25. If the stock price fluctuates >$66.25, the other person could buy a share for $10 and immediately sell that share on the market price for a profit.\n\nOP also bought from an unknown person the right to buy 1 share of UVXY stock for $15 from them within the next two years for $51.65. If the price fluctuates >$66.65, OP could sell the shares and make a profit for the amount.\n\nThese two trades, together, are known as a call spread. OP bought $51.65 worth of calls and sold $56.25 worth of calls, netting him $4.60 immediately. Let\u2019s imagine UVXY is always worth less than $66.25 between now and the expiration date (2 years from now). At expiration, the other party to whom OP sold could abandon their position if the stock is low enough or seen as worthless and OP walks away with $4.60 since OP would also abandon his position. If the other person executes their position (because the stock is now >$66.25 or they just want to minimize losses), they pay OP an additional $10 and OP must give them a stock certificate. OP would then execute his position to get a stock certificate, making the final loss for OP (56.25 + 10 \u2013 UVXY) + (- 51.65 - 15 + UVXY) = -0.40. This means that you are making a bet where you could either lose $0.40 or gain $4.60. However, you get that $4.60 immediately to do whatever with, but at some point you might owe $5.00 making it a $0.40 loss.\n\n---------\nPuts:\n\nOP sold to an unknown person the right to sell him 1 share of stock for $15 within the next two years for $4.03. If the stock price fluctuates <$10.97, the other person could buy a share on the market then sell that share to OP for $15 for immediate profit.\n\nOP also bought from an unknown person the right to sell them 1 share of stock for $10 within the next two years for $2.88. If the stock price fluctuates <$7.12, OP could buy a share on the market then sell that share to them for $10 for immediate profit.\n\nThese two trades, together, are (similar to before) known as a put spread. Op bought $2.88 worth of puts and sold $4.03 worth of puts for an immediate profit of 1.15. Let\u2019s imagine UVXY is always worth more than $15 between now and the expiration date. The other party to whom OP sold would abandon their position because they wouldn\u2019t ever want to sell OP something worth more than $15 to him for $15. OP would also abandon his position, netting him $1.15 profit. If the price goes below $15, the other party to whom OP sold could exercise their position, making OP\u2019s loss: (4.03 \u2013 15 + UVXY) +(-2.88 + 10 \u2013 UVXY) = -3.85. Like before, this means that you are making a bet where you could either lose $3.85 or gain $1.15. Like before, you also get $1.15 to do whatever with immediately, though at some point you might owe $5.00 making it a $3.85 loss.\n\n------------\nBox Spread:\n\nBecause OP had these two options together, he got an immediate $4.60+$1.15 = $5.75. If the call side were executed, he would owe $5.00 making his net profit now only $0.75. If the stock price at some point, drops below $15, the short side may be executed making OP owe $5.00 making his total loss $0.75-$5.00=-$4.25. This could also happen the other way, put then call. These strategies together gave OP a bet to potentially lose $4.25 for the chance to potentially gain $0.75 or $5.75. OP was also given $5.75 upfront for making this bet with the possibility of owing $5.00 or $10.00.\n\nSo, why do this?\n\nThis style of box spread can be a way to lower your overall risk if you think that within the expiration time, there is very little chance of a stock going above a certain price AND also below another price. Unless there is huge boom and bust, you should walk away with some profit. However, your brokerage (Robinhood) would need you to have collateral for the chance that your whole plan fails and the stock does fluctuate hugely up and down. In OP\u2019s case, his total potential loss was $212,500 and his gain potentials were $287,500 if both the calls and puts expire or $37,500 if only one of the calls or puts expires. Basically, Robinhood should not have given him the initial $287,500 unless he also had assets in his account worth more than $500,000 ($212,500 + $287,500) as collateral in case his strategy fails. Robinhood realized this after the call-side of his strategy was executed and his potential earnings were now only $37,500 with $287,500 potential losses. Robinhood said oh shit and sold everything OP had done for market value and closed his account, leaving him with a loss of like $58k.\n\n------------\nTL;DR WSB proves once again that they have no idea how any of this works. Robinhood fucked up. OP fucked up. This is funny.\n\nEdit: Changed share price from ~$50-55 to ~$60. It wouldn't make sense for a share to be under the premium price of a call option.",

            "First: it\u2019s not drama. Just another day in that sub, everyone is loving\n\nNow, for those that don\u2019t know, wsb is a sub where people are pretty much doing stupid investments. It\u2019s kind of an in joke.\n\nA box spread is a type of investment strategy. Essentially, you make four bets. Each of these bets is in a way the opposite of another one of the bets. They\u2019re called options, and they expire at some point. This strategy will work if they all have the same expiration date and they all expire at the same time. \n\nThe risk in this investment is that you end up putting your faith in someone else\u2019s hands. There are two types of options, puts and calls. Essentially puts are betting against a security, and calls are betting for the security.\n\nThe strategy involves buying a put and buying a call, and selling a call and a put. It\u2019s the \u201cselling\u201d part where OP fucked up. Essentially, these options allow the user to buy or sell a stock at a certain price. There are two types of options, ITM (in the money) and OTM(out of the money). When you sell a put or a call, someone has to buy it. The person that buys it now is promised that if they excercise their option, that you\u2019ll sell them the security for the price which the option said. \n\nWhen you sell your put and your call (2 of the bets you have to make), you have to make sure they are OTM. Because if they\u2019re ITM, that\u2019s a no brainer for the person that buys them. They\u2019ll use them and turn profit immediately, rather than letting them expire. This strategy only works if this doesn\u2019t happen, they all have to expire. \n\nOP sold retardedly ITM calls, which immediately got exercised . RH fucked up and gave him a bunch of robinhood credit, which is debt essentially. Money he doesn\u2019t have. Since the person who bought his calls wanted to use them, it was now up to OP to sell the buyer of the call 5000 shares of the option\u2019s security priced at $40 (if memory serves, I think that was it). Meaning that he was on the hook for 20k worth of stock that he needed to sell, which he couldn\u2019t because he borrowed all his money. Then robinhood realized they fucked up and sold off all his positions, making him lose more money.\n\nHope that helped. Options are complicated and will fucking destroy you if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing, which is what that sub is about! Making risky bets not knowing what you\u2019re doing. It\u2019s great, highly recommend the sub",

            "While the internet has a oversimplified view of grooming, like just knowing someone when they're under 18 and ending up in a relationship when they are of age doesn't make it grooming, what makes it grooming is behaviours of older person to the younger person, there are [characteristics of grooming to look out for](https://www.allure.com/story/what-is-sexual-grooming-abuse) when judging if something is grooming or not, and it's the presence or absence of those characteristics that determines if grooming occurred or not. If they hit it off after she was 18 that wouldn't be grooming. But if teacher was setting her up for a relationship when she still was his student, that would be grooming. The problem with their comment is that they gave a scenario, were grooming could have easily occured, but haven't said any details of the situation that would clear up if grooming happened or not, and they just got defensive which makes people who might have sided with him assume he has a guilty conscience.",

This same student was welllll known for flirting with other teachers who would also harass other students. Basically, if she was \u201cfriendly\u201d with them, they were a creep. She was groomed her entire high school career and it paid off for one teacher. It turns my stomach to think about. We, as students, brought it to the school\u2019s attention several times- she definitely wasn\u2019t the only student these men harassed and one female teacher was finally arrested for having a threesome with a student and another teacher a year or so ago- but none of the men ever saw consequences and one was even promoted to principal.\n\nMeanwhile the community insists nothing is wrong with the school because this is all covered up and not discussed openly.

Yeah, I was 18 and he was in his 30s, so it wasn't like I couldn't have made my own choices. \n\nI had just gone through a bad break up and would visit him in the shop at night where he taught adult classes. The shop was where I felt comfortable and I confided in him about how I had been feeling lately. Started out with a dumb sexual innuendo from him, which turned into flirting, which led to other things I wish I hadn't agreed to. Idk. \n\nThat was 14 years ago and through that whole time he still texted me when he was horny and bored. He would say \"we are just friends having adult conversations! Nothing wrong with that\". I cut ties with him in December last year. Literally told him not to contact me again and he acted like he didn't understand why. \n\nI wish that whole mess hadn't happened.

I cut ties immediately and get to spend the rest of my life questioning what I dodged or what he got out of our friendship.

The story of a college instructor dating a student has been a part of movies forever, and never once that I can think of has it been portrayed favorably.\n\nEdit: That being said, and maybe I'm playing devil's advocate here, is every instance of a person being an acquaintance of a minor at one point, and then developing a relationship with that person after that person came of age, necessarily  an example of \"grooming\"? Because that's a can of worms itself--if that's the case, then you are accusing everyone of age who has any interaction at all with someone who is not of age of predatory behavior that just hasn't manifested yet, but is inevitable; your default position is that \"if anyone has romantic feelings towards another person, then the person with romantic feelings has ALWAYS had romantic feeling towards that person, from the moment they met that person, including when the subject of that feeling was a minor, thus the one with that feeling has always been a sexual predator.\" And that's not how it works.",

While I\u2019ll admit that I initially rolled my eyes at yet another Gruff White Male Protagonist\u2122 in a grim world - especially one with such a Gruff White Male Protagonist\u2122-ey name as Deacon St. John - I ended up getting far more invested than I\u2019d initially expected. I shouldn\u2019t be surprised, I suppose - this is a first-party Sony title, and Bend is no stranger to writing around well-developed characters and games with a strong narrative focus, either.\" Article [source](https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/06/days-gone-open-world-gameplay-impressions)\n\nExcept for the fact that for years games were criticized for the fact that every protagonist bled together and were virtually all the same. They were white, gruff, and spoke in a deep voice. Ten games could come out and all of the protagonists would bleed together. Gamers however ignore this history and decide that the journalist is [racist](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/axwjh9/days_gone_hands_on_preview_ign/ehwl9by/). This in turn spawns arguments about racism, whatabout this and more fun! /r/Games of course [weighed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/axxtjy/ign_days_gone_weve_finally_seen_the_sum_of_its/ehwrco0/) in and felt similarly.

            "Whilst I am still not a fan of his movies, I have mad respect for Snyder after this. He went out of his way to denounce the Geeks + Gamers channel. Unfortunately, G+G and friends responded by spewing their usual bile, with one guy going as far as making an extended \"joke\" about lining up and executing Asian people. Absolutely disgusting.\n\nLike, they somehow expected Snyder to be on their side just because they supported the Snyder Cut. Sure, he comes across as an edgelord at times, but it's laughable that they're surprised he denounced their obsessive racism, sexism, and everything else they cram into their videos and awful thumbnails. You only have to take one peek at the channel to be greeted with countless rant/slander videos against people like Kathleen Kennedy and Brie Larson.\n\nFor someone high-profile like Snyder to condemn them directly, pretty much to their faces, is fantastic.\n\nThey're also pulling the \"WB execs told him to say it!\" card, and honestly it doesn't come across that way at all. Snyder's children are Asian and he stated as much on the stream - and if you're aware of the circumstances surrounding why he dropped out of directing the original Justice League, it becomes pretty clear why this kind of stuff hits very close to home for him.\n\nWhilst I don't know if G+G themselves have participated, channels of their ilk are now perpetuating false claims that Snyder somehow enabled his daughter's suicide and so on (so much for them hating \"cancel culture\"). Vile stuff, and they still can't fathom why he tore them a new one.",

            "As someone that has used Discord almost since Day 1 and has been a longtime Nitro Supporter I want to add my few Cents. No this rebranding was not necessary to appeal to a wider audience. The old branding and mascot where a unique identifier and had no \"gaming\" specific connection. The new Designs and Backgrounds (in the places they have been implemented yet) all show Cheerful Cartoon Illustrations performing a wide variety of fun Activities, weirdly that this is supposed to move away from gaming; yet multiple of these Figures play Videogames in their Illustration. If you ask me, a unecessary and pointless change that more hurts their Brand Recognition and is a waste of Funds. Second no nitro is not \"basically\" cosmetic Stuff. Nitro consists almost entirely of functional Upgrades. In addition to higher Resolution and frame rate you get access to a higher bitrate. You get a increased Upload Limit for any Files you want to send directly, say you don't have Nitro you can only sent a whopping maximum of 8 megabytes. Which is a number they already increased not so long ago, it used to be even less. Lastly you get access to so called Server Boosts which are used to quote on quote upgrade Server's and give them similar perks (higher Bitrate etc and more Branding Options for Communities) if enough Boosts are spent. All in all a majority of Nitro users use Nitro for it's functional perks and not for the Gif Profile Picture or the Universal Emojis. You also had some games and other game related perks but they removed these and have yet to properly replace them (apart from increasing the upload level and giving us Boosts). While this is still a steep price at 10 USD for features that should be either be basic access or are cosmetic some like me considered it a way of supporting Discord. Something that I stopped doing a couple months ago because I had enough. The Software becomes more cluttered with time moving on, server issues persist that I still remember from years ago, there are phantom disconnects which also exist since the early days of discord and then they also removed Europe West from the Server Selection and unified it into a single Location. The lack of support and response to feedback was just the last straw for me.

Things here started when somebody explains the rotation of the moon.\n\n\n>>Oh, it has a full rotation, all right...once every 28 days or so. Which happens to be the exact same time it takes to orbit the Earth. So here on Earth we always see the same side. This is called [tidal locking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking), and occurs because if it had a rotation period different from its orbital period, tidal forces would slightly stretch and squeeze the Moon (same as how the Earth's oceans are stretched and squeezed by the Sun, creating tides). So those tidal forces keep the periods matched.\n>\n>That doesn\u2019t make any sense. For the moon to spin on its axis, no matter how fast or slow, it must show all sides of itself to the earth.\n\nAnd, we're off!\n\n>>>Oh, I\u2019ve examined this very throughly and it there is no explanation that makes sense. The only way it makes sense is if the moon is \u201cdriving\u201d around the earth like a race car around a track. Which is NOT spinning on its axis. For the moon to spin on its own axis, it MUST show all sides of itself to the earth.\n>>\n>> Did you try looking at [this picture from the Wikipedia article?](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking#/media/File:Tidal_locking_of_the_Moon_with_the_Earth.gif)\n>\n>\tYes. Like I said, I\u2019ve already examined this every which-way and it doesn\u2019t make sense. Look closely the gif you provided. Look at the way the moon is traveling around the earth. It\u2019s moving forward just like a race car drives around a racetrack. You would never say a race car is spinning on its own axis, would you? Remember that \u201cspinning on its own axis\u201d means to spin like a top, around an imaginary line going through the center of it.\n>\n>\tWhat the moon is doing is revolving around the earth. It is NOT spinning on its own axis. Your gif proves this without a doubt.\n\n[A user with the patience of a saint tries to engage, but is rebuffed:](https://reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/kp6g55/_/ghwqzlt/?context=2)\n\n>> Uh...what? Did you just pull this \u201cexplanation\u201d out of thin air? In all the explanations I came across trying to figure this out, I never read anything like what you are saying. You make no sense whatsoever. \n>Well, you don\u2019t understand what \u201cspinning on an axis\u201d means, so we aren\u2019t going to get very far. Can you explain to me what an axis is?\n>\n>\tA ball being whipped around your head is not spinning on ITS OWN AXIS. The axis it is spinning on is YOUR HEAD. You don\u2019t understand what an \u201caxis\u201d is, or what spinning upon it even means. It\u2019s bizarre.\n\nAnother user steps in to help, but to no avail:\n\n>>> Doesn\u2019t seem like you know what an \u201caxis\u201d is either.\n\n>>I do know what an axis is which is why I'm telling you in that animation if you stop the moon from driving around the track it will still continue to spin.\n>>\n>>It's literally how it's animated. The moon icon is spinning and then it's animated to rotate around the track.\n>>\n>>The same principle is happening in outer space.\n>>\n>>It is spinning on its axis, while at the same time it has a path in space around the earth that you call the race track.\n>>\n>>Anyways I just thought I'd try to help you understand but it seems you're very snarky with everyone.\n>>\n>>Thank you for the laughs and have a good night.\n\n>\tThe moon is not spinning on its own axis. The \"spin\" you describe is just a relative result of moving in a forward circular motion around a center object (the axis). A carousel horse has the same \"spin\" as it moves around the center point of the ride but obviously is not spinning on its own axis. It's fixed in place, facing forward. For it to spin on its own axis, it would spin around relative to ITSELF. All these moon gifs show the exact same thing as a carousel horse.\n>\n>>I do know what an axis is\n>\n>No. You don't.\n\nA user provides video evidence, but things get heated:\n\n>\tI understand your mind won't let you understand this (extremely simple) concept because that would mean going against the \"experts\" and result in a complete paradigm shift that you apparently are not ready for. I understand your mentality but it's still totally bizarre and fascinating.\n\n[Perhaps, *we* are the ones who are wrong?](https://reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/kp6g55/_/ghwrru8/)\n\n>>>Yes, I\u2019ve read the wiki. And everything else I can get my hands on about it. Not one single explanation makes logical sense. In ALL of these \u201cexplanations\u201d, they have the moon driving like a race car around the earth, NOT rotating on its own axis.\n>>>\n>>>>This isn't speculation, it's fact...\n>>>\n>>>It\u2019s pretty easy to see that this is not fact.\n>>\n>>I don't even know how to reply to that. It's literal fact. This isn't theory, it's proven and observed. The fact you can't comprehend it doesn't make it not fact. \n>\n>\tThis is a really simple concept. It doesn\u2019t matter how many \u201cexperts\u201d are saying that it\u2019s a \u201cfact\u201d when their explanations directly contradict what they are saying.\n>\n>\tThey say the moon rotates on its own axis.

I'm stating that what we are TOLD (aka the moon spinning on its axis while it orbits earth) is a bunch of bullshit because it's not possible for it to do that and keep one entire side completely hidden to us.\n\n-----\n\nI've tried to format the conversations in Markdown so they're easy to follow, and in anticipation of some being deleted.

            "Hey! Firstly I know I'm a day late here, but would like you to try and experiment yourself that may help you understand the scientific evidence of Moon's rotation.\n\n\n**Tl;Dr** : Proof of how moon rotates through experimentation. **Also in the last two paragraphs, proof of how a race car rotates while driving around a circular track, also through experimentation.**\n\n\nIt's very simple experiment. You'll need 2 crosses connected at their center by string. Also if you can draw a large square grid on which the two crosses could be placed, it'll be helpful. Or if you have a tiled floor, that'll work too. \n\n\nSo, to begin, place the center of one cross at any vertex of the square on the grid. Place the second cross to the right of the already placed cross along a horizontal line. \n\n\nNow, the left cross here will always be fixed (no rotation, nothing) and is representing Earth. (*Keeping the Earth fixed here implies that we are in Earth's reference frame.*) \n\n\nThe other cross is representing the moon. Now move the Moon Cross (MC) around the Earth Cross (EC), keeping the same arm of MC facing the EC at all times. I hope you'll agree that this in fact is the motion of Moon as viewed from the Earth. This is also the motion of a race car driving around a circular track, as seen from the center of the track. \n\n\nIf you're with me up till here, see how one particular arm of the MC is always facing EC. Let's call this arm Fixed Arm(FA). Also see *how the same arm of the MC changes it's orientation with the grid below the crosses.* \n\n\nInitially, when we first started revolving MC around the EC, the FA was *horizontal with respect to the grid*. When the MC was on top or on bottom of the EC, the FA was *vertical with respect to the grid*.\n\n\nYou can witness how the FA, as well as the other arms of MC change their direction with respect to the grid below the crosses. This shows that the MC is actually *rotating with respect to the grid*. But still, the FA is always facing the EC. \n\n\nAre you still with me? If not try rotating the MC around EC again keeping FA facing towards the center of EC always. \n\n\nOk. So now you've seen the rotation of MC *with respect to the grid* but still not with respect to the EC. Now, do you remember when we began this experiment, I told you to keep the Earth Cross fixed, and keeping the EC fixed implies we are in reference frame of Earth Cross. That means what we are doing here is as seen from earth. \n\n\nWhat else did we fix along with the EC. The MC? No. The square grid? Yes. Throughout the experiment we didn't move neither the EC not the grid. Which means, the grid is also in the same reference frame as earth. Which means, the relative rotation of the MC's arm and the grid lines will be the same as relative motion of MC around the EC. \n\n\nStill if you have doubt that the Moon or the MC is not rotating, let's change one single thing in the experiment. Keep the orientation of MC fixed, i.e. , keep the arms that are horizontal always horizontal and arms that are vertical always vertical. \n\n\nNow if you see the motion of MC around EC, you'll notice that every arm of MC comes closer to EC at some point. Thus, the MC has to be in rotation in order to always have the same side face towards EC always. \n\n\nComing to the race car example. Tell me, are you familiar with clip art on Microsoft PowerPoint. If you ever have the chance, search for car clip art in PowerPoint. PowerPoint also has there animations and we can set animations for clip arts as well. So select the car clip and apply circle animation, that makes the clip art go in a circular motion around any point in the screen. You will find that the clip art, the car, does not rotate and just circles the screen. This is the motion you will see if a *real race car* was not rotating on its own axis while driving on a circular track as well. \n\n\nThe confusion of the race car may arise due to the fact that we, as a driver, don't intend to rotate the car about it's own axis. (Actually, steering the car *is doing* exactly that.) We turn the steering to turn the car. This turning of car is actually a rotation about it's own central axis. \n\n\nLet me prove this too. Take a toy car and hold it on a treadmill running at some speed. Now as you're holding the toy car in your hand, **twist** the car to the right, you'll see that it **steers** the car towards right. Thus proving that steering is actually rotation about one's own centeral axis. \n\n\nHope this clears things up. HMU in case it doesn't.",

            "I recently had a discussion with some friends about this, who agreed that Rush Limbaugh was a garbage excuse for a human being, but argued that it's still tasteless to celebrate someone's death, especially right after it happened. They pointed out that everyone has friends and family who grieve them.\n\nMy response was just that I'm a little more apathetic about the issue. I'm not trying to advocate *for* celebrating someone's death or shitting on people's graves. I just see the celebrations as the unsurprising consequences of their actions in life. Rush Limbaugh was a 100% verified complete piece of shit. He had the choice to live his life differently, and he knew that along with his family and loved ones. It's not hard to live your life in a way that warrants a basic amount of respect when you die. But when you go very far out of your way to choose to live your life in a way that makes people *want* to celebrate your death on such a large scale, people celebrating your death is the consequence.\n\nAnd in my opinion, it's disingenuous to argue that people (and their family and friends) should be exempt from the consequences of their actions just because they died.",
            "Rush Limbaugh had a segment where bells and whistles would play as he read a list of people who died from AIDS. \n\nRush Limbaugh spent multiple shows comparing 12-year-old Chelsea Clinton to a dog.\n\nRush Limbaugh is almost completely responsible for how despicable the GOP has become. He was a terrible man. \n\nI think the best way to describe my feelings about it is this quote from attorney Clarence Darrow, who said; \"I've never wished a man dead, but I've read some obituaries with great pleasure.\"",

            "These are just a few of thousands of blatantly racist takes Rush made while on air: \n\n* **\u201cI mean, let\u2019s face it, we didn\u2019t have slavery in this country for over 100 years because it was a bad thing. Quite the opposite: slavery built the South. I\u2019m not saying we should bring it back; I\u2019m just saying it had its merits. For one thing, the streets were safer after dark.\u201d**\n* **\u201cYou know who deserves a posthumous Medal of Honor? James Earl Ray [the confessed assassin of Martin Luther King]. We miss you, James. Godspeed.\u201d**\n* \"Have you ever noticed how all composite pictures of wanted criminals resemble Jesse Jackson?\u201d\n* \"Right. So you go into Darfur and you go into South Africa, you get rid of the white government there. You put sanctions on them. You stand behind Nelson Mandela \u2014 who was bankrolled by communists for a time, had the support of certain communist leaders. You go to Ethiopia. You do the same thing.\u201d\n* \u201cLook, let me put it to you this way: the NFL all too often looks like a game between the Bloods and the Crips without any weapons. There, I said it.\u201d\n* \u201cThe NAACP should have riot rehearsal. They should get a liquor store and practice robberies.\u201d\n* \"They\u2019re 12 percent of the population. Who the hell cares?\u201d\n* \u201cTake that bone out of your nose and call me back (to an African American female caller).\u201d\n* \u201cI think the media has been very desirous that a black quarterback do well. They\u2019re interested in black coaches and black quarterbacks doing well. I think there\u2019s a little hope invested in McNabb and he got a lot of credit for the performance of his team that he really didn\u2019t deserve.\u201d\n\nA lot of people have shared the popular anecdote that Rush played music as he gleefully read the names of gay men who were dying of AIDs in the early 90s, but it ignores how genuinely and obviously racist the man was (not to mention Islamophobic and chauvinistic). \n\nI don't say this lightly, I'm glad the man is gone, but sad that he got to die having successfully radicalized generations of predominantly men to his perverse world view.\n\nEdit: and the reason I bring this is not to excuse or whitewash his homophobic remarks, which extend well past that one segment, but to highlight depsite the conservative defense we have seen recently of Rush's behavior in regards to that segment (it only lasted a couple weeks and Rush later regretted the segment), Rush made a career on bigoted takes like that segment for decades against basically anyone that was not a straight, white, Christian male.\n\nEdit #2: For full disclosure, the bolded quotes are attributed to Rush - but when he said them is under question. [Here is the Snopes article on this list.](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/rush-limbaugh-racist-quotes/) The first and second quotes come from the book *101 People Who Are Really Screwing America* by Jack Huberman who says he procured the quotes from a source that he won't name under advise from counsel.",

He was broadcasting up until a week and a half before he keeled over. He had stepped away for another round of treatment while psychotic second bananas filled in in his daily radio propaganda and misinformation show. He spewed the same dreck daily for decades on terrestrial talk radio. Anyone that \"missed him\" wasn't looking for him. Conservative talk radio has at least one station (or more) in all radio markets. \n\n>but he influenced all the big names I listen to now.\n\nLike who? Because any station that aired Rush/EIB also hosted the knock-offs (Hannity, Levin, Ingraham, Plante, Kudlow, etc.) Rush was the flagship conservative talk radio program. Any station broadcasting Rush did so because that was THE lucrative program to air. And the others were fill-ins for the airtime when Rush was broadcasting or re-run later in the evening.\n\n> From what I know he was one of a kind & this is a huge loss. RIP \u2764\ufe0f\n\nDefinitely one of a kind (thankfully) and definitely a major loss to the conservative propaganda machine and its mouthpieces: talk radio.\n\n>Does anyone know where I can get right wing opinion media now?\n\nThe exact same place you've been getting it for the last 30 years, you disingenuous fraud. \n\n>He will be missed by 15.5 million AM radio listeners.\n\n* His program was broadcast on FM and AM depending on market - sometimes both at once.\n\n* Nielsen/Arbitron (Nielsen bought Arbitron a while back, IIRC) still use Diary for radio ratings/listenership...the most inaccurate ratings method ever. Where are they getting 15.5 million from? The talk radio sales account executives?\n\nI really hope the conservative talk circuit crumbles now that their misinformation-spewing \"godfather\" is off the air.",

For all intents and purposes, they \u2018won\u2019. \nRush didn\u2019t live to see his empire crumble, he didn\u2019t see the violence and hatred he\u2019s responsible for fomenting come back at him. Death comes for us all eventually, its not some karmic justice for an old man to die in bed next to his wife, with his fortune intact. \n\nAnd while I\u2019m glad he won\u2019t be around to shit up the airwaves anymore, the reality is decades of damage have already been done, and his absence isn\u2019t going to undo that.

            "I hate FUCKING hate tankies. If they were actual socialists, they would know to hate the class system that makes people rich NOT rich people themselves. We live in a society that is built on the wealthy exploitation of workers. People are capable of being good while profiting off an evil system. In fact many people believe that capitalism is good and thus unknowning support the exploitation of poorer people. Dividing people into \"goodies\" and \"baddies\" is a useless dicatomy.\n\nThinking like this is what made China and the USSR failed states. The idea of creating another political hierarchy from some former workers and persecuting the middle and wealthy classes is just gonna flip the same evil system around. Mao was a former peasant and killed a bunch of landlords and just created a new hierarchy made up of him and his CCP buddies. Did peasant standard of living improve with the accession of Mao? Probably a little but they were still at the bottom of a authoritative hierarchy with basically no control of their own lives.\n\nSocialists as a rule should limit hierarchies as much as possible, or even reject then entirely (like anarchists). They should also understand that is possible for economic hierarchies to exist in socialist governments. Like in China during the great famine... I wonder why all the poor rural famers didn't get food and supplies while the party members in Beijing did? /s. Almost like they were higher up in some hypothetical peaking order. A hierarchy if you will.\n\nAnd just from, like, an optics point of view. Do they really think they are gonna win any support with telling some random Redditor that his grandparents deserved to die?\n\nI'm saying all of this as someone who is a socdem who's heavily interested in democratisation of the workplace and the elimination of massive inheritance of wealth intergenerationally, so I'm anything but a lib.",

Admonish the sinner and instruct the ignorant? Prevent active scandal? A family member of mine has publicly embraced a same-sex relationship. She still receives the Eucharist and insists we treat them as a valid couple the same way my family treats me and my fiance. I don't think that's right. At the very least she should not be receiving Communion in public unrepentant sin, but if I tell her that or that I don't think she should bring her girlfriend to my wedding, I will be seen as the \"hateful\" bigot of the family.\n\nhttps://www.reveddit.com/v/Catholicism/comments/sd8y3j/pope_francis_tells_parents_not_to_condemn/hub7wgb/?ps_after\n\n> The pope has no statement about the evil of the lgbt movement itself and how they abuse and brainwash kids. But he makes a statement to the parents of gay people not to disown them? So just let them continue on their sin like nothing is wrong? That will lead them both to hell.\n\nhttps://www.reveddit.com/v/Catholicism/comments/sd51gk/support_your_children_if_they_are_gay_pope_tells/huag6ma/#t1_huag6ma\n\n\n> > Really is crazy how wild the swing was from universal ostracization of homosexuality to the universal celebration and encouragement of it. There was basically zero time spent anywhere in between, and so no one had a chance to calmly work out the rationale for his own stance on it.\n> \n> Have you seen the interviews with Yuri Bezmenov? This was all strategically planned. Relativism, secularism, socialism, communism, anarchism, they all have the goal of overthrowing western culture, and they each use each other for their own nefarious ends. This is why they borrow the same social manipulation strategies. As Yuri will point out, typically the Communist is the one at the top of the manipulation pyramid, with the socialist, secularist, and anarchist being used and manipulated by appealing to their base emotions in order to destabilized and tear down a society or ideology over night, so that something else can take its place.\n\nhttps://www.reveddit.com/v/Catholicism/comments/sd8y3j/pope_francis_tells_parents_not_to_condemn/hubljlv/?ps_after=1643223699%2C1643233002%2C1643241289%2C1643247800#t1_hubljlv\n\n> > This is why I love this pope. I am gay and was raised Catholic though, and I absolutely never felt discriminated against at my church. The only exception was one homily at a smaller college church I sometimes attended and the priest was actually previously a pastor at a protestant church. I recently started going back to church and the priest at the church I started going to made similar statements about loving people and not hating them over their race or sexuality. The Catholic church is the only Christian Church I feel safe attending as a gay man and the atmosphere is 10000% different from the pentecostal church my dad made us go to\n> \n> This is why the pope's statements are so dangerous. People hear \"we need to love people and not hate them!\" and take it to mean \"having gay sex is perfectly a ok!\".\n\nhttps://www.reveddit.com/v/Catholicism/comments/sd8y3j/pope_francis_tells_parents_not_to_condemn/hucwh4v/?ps_after=1643223699%2C1643233002%2C1643241289%2C1643247800#t1_hucwh4v\n\nOne final particularly funny spat:\n\n> Lmao. You think I'm a radtrad? Too bad I don't go to the Latin Mass, don't have a problem with Vatican 2, and don't particularly like the \"Traditionalist\" movement.\n> \n> The reason I say Francis is only toeing the line of heresy is because I am giving him the most charitable possible reading.\n\nhttps://www.reveddit.com/v/Catholicism/comments/sd51gk/support_your_children_if_they_are_gay_pope_tells/huambx4/#t1_huambx4",

It was only ever universal in a modern legal sense in many places bc Catholicism (and other flavours of Christianity) spread such doctrine around the world through violent imperialism.\n\n[Meanwhile, homosexual relationships were decriminalized in the Ottoman Empire in 1858](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4r17fc/what_lead_to_the_ottoman_empire_decriminalizing/d4xwz1l/) (requisite caveats need to be applied here that such relationships are not like how modern LGBT relationships are thought of today obviously, but still). Of course, this was characterized by the West, particularly western Christians, as evidence that Muslims and other non-Christians were \"depraved\" and \"uncivilized\" and needed the guiding force of Christianity to \"help\" them. But it's mindblowing how narrow some people's world views are in reality. And moreover, just sad how intellectually uncurious they really are.",

You know the very few who say they hate cis/white/males. I saw it as an opinion of the so-named progressives as a whole. Instead of just the loud minority.\n\nThis should have been a flag but despite being on Tumblr for a very long time, I didn't see evidence of those people except in that sub and others like it. But I did see well meaning leftists and lumped them into the group. And oddly enough I didn't identify as republican, but as libertarian (I *know*). \n\nI can't point to any one incident that woke me up (no pun intended). It was a multitude of things: reality wasn't holding up to the extreme i was seeing on the sub, I found myself agreeing with some of the points I was supposed to be disagreeing with. And Trump happened.  I think he radicalized a lot of people for both good and bad. \n\nI grew to realize that in the name of protecting POC or LGBTQIA, it was just thinly veiled hatred toward them. It really was. They only liked the right kind, what they were accusing the opposite of doing. They liked Candace Owens for example. Idk if they still do because I haven't been there in a while. \n\nBut slowly and with therapy for unrelated issues (which in turn helped this issue), I stopped being so angry and hateful, and sort of embraced what was always part of my personality deep down: just letting people be. And realizing that just because I didn't see oppression didn't mean it wasn't happening (and when I opened my eyes, I did see oppression). And there actually is a gay agenda. The agenda is to be accepted. Nobody is pushing a narrative, the narrative has always been there. It's just more obvious now. \n\nSomething that helped (this wasn't the entirety, though, it just helped) was books. I've always loved to read but I used to hate when a books mc turned was anything other than white or straight, because that was the whole plot. I felt duped and like the writer sucked because God can't you write about something else? Bring non white or non straight isn't the whole aspect of someone. But that wasn't a fault of the writer. What was actually happening was those kinds of stories were only let into very few literary circles. And those circles just didn't hold my attention natively. However, more and more other genres were letting more diversity in, genres I do dig like horror and sci-fi. \n\nI know I'm going to get a lot of hate for this comment and that's fine, I deserve it. I was a trash person. I'm better now I like to think.",

Chances are, everyone who read that comment (or this one, for that matter) has committed \"*crimes*\", likely many \"*crimes*\", throughout their lives. Speeding is a crime. Punching or threatening to punch someone is a crime. Possession of cannabis (depending on your state, but also any other drugs), trespassing,  public intoxication, underaged drinking, driving with an expired license or plates, driving without a seatbelt etc. Feeding the homeless without a permit is a crime in many cities, and so is homelessness. How many of you have committed one or more of these crimes in your lifetime? In the last year? This week?\n\nThe point is: if a cop was watching *you*, or literally anyone else, 24/7, they will 99.9% of the time find a reason to arrest you or fine you for \"*crimes*\" that you commit. Adding more cops does increase \"*crime*\" simply because everyone is a \"*criminal*\" sometimes, and the law is constantly evolving, redefining what a crime and criminal is, and usually *expanding* the definition, so even *more* people are criminals.\n\nSome of you may say \"*Well, obviously there are everyday crimes, but what about the actually troublesome crimes?*\".

It\u2019s important to understand that police by and large discriminate against POC for nebulous reasons that are difficult to address. I could get into all of the statistics about disproportionate representation in arrests and similar stuff, but it\u2019s the war on drugs at the center of the issue. Police need the funding they currently have because they put away POC for drug use and distribution so damn often. If they arrested/incarcerated/detained POC at the rate that they do for whites, then there would be a shit ton of cash left over that could be used to better communities with those problems, meaning there\u2019s a way to prevent it from happening that saves money, maximizes freedom, and stimulates the economy. (I\u2019m shocked this isn\u2019t the conservative position) And I mean a LOT of money. Like, take your guesstimate and multiply it by five. Police aren\u2019t incentivized to make these changes though because they profit from the current system. The problem isn\u2019t racist police officers, it really is systemic and not the in the manner you probably were familiar with before. The divisive nature of discourse on the topic comes from the verbiage meaning different things to different people, and enemies of America have made sure of that. When conservatives talk about BLM being a hokey scam, they\u2019re usually talking about BLM the shady organization, but when liberals talk about BLM being an empowering social movement, they\u2019re talking about BLM the social phenomenon. When conservatives hear \u201cdefund the police\u201d, they think of lawless states where social workers are supposed to hug out car-jackings and burglary, but when liberals hear \u201cdefund the police\u201d, they think of money wasted on removing people from contributing to the economy and engaging with society going to bettering communities because there is a legitimate path for that to become a reality. It just doesn\u2019t start with defunding the police."

And so, saying Kanye inviting Manson was an act of \u2018forgiveness\u2019 absolutely doesn\u2019t make things better. It implies that Kanye is completely fine with Manson\u2019s actions and wants to invite someone like Manson to his party. \n\nThe argument that \u2018Kanye doesn\u2019t believe those allegations\u2019 makes more sense than the \u2018Kanye forgave Manson\u2019 argument.

If you give up the position of being a woman, you no longer get its 'privileges' (as opposed to looking at what the medical reality of the situation is here). \n\nObviously the answer is legally shared parental leave, but whatever.

        "selftext": " \n\nGood evening, earlier today the head moderator of the second most popular sub about the lego toyline Bionicle, Zaktastic, emerged after four years to ban two of the subreddit\u2019s main moderator\u2019s without warning. Further unbanning multiple users responsible for LGBTQ+ hate comments from the subreddit.\n\n**SUBJECT CONTEXT**\n\nFor a bit of context, r/bioniclelego is a subreddit dedicated to AFOLs (Adult Fans Of Lego) sharing community creations, story discussions, and community based conversations surrounding the famous Lego Toyline Bionicle, which was known for its expansive story, complex characters, and deep lore, all surrounding a group of bio-mechanical warriors called \u2018Toa\u2019 in their eternal fight against fierce masters of darkness to save their universe. It\u2019s a story about kindness, duty, self discovery, and most importantly, unity.\n\n**DRAMA CONTEXT**\n\nSince its original cancellation, the bionicle community has been extremely active, still creating original and pre-existing characters for the fun of the hobby on multiple message boards and small online communities. The founder of the subreddit is a user named \u201cZaktastic\u201d, a rather elusive member of the community, as his last reported interference in the reddit-based community was around 2018. Two moderators were primarily responsible for keeping the subreddit civil and inclusive, the primary being GinkoWeed. GinkoWeed was an extremely popular moderator in the community, as they were the fastest and most effective at getting hate speech and other heinous posts removed from the subreddit. Quite literally a week ago from this post, GinkoWeed posted an official [announcement](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/849017637743624223/992931075045204028/Screenshot_20220625-150920.png?width=523&height=630) condemning transphobic and other anti-LGBTQ+ behavior from the subreddit, as the bionicle community and LGBT community have a significant overlap in members. GinkoWeed did their job extremely well for many years, keeping out several trolls and malicious users, up until today.\n\n**CURRENT DRAMA**\n\nAs of today, Zaktastic has [banned](https://www.reddit.com/r/BIONICLE/comments/vpwqu7/so_lets_talk_about_zaktastic/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) GinkoWeed as well as several other moderators with little to no warning, stating that he did not approve of the fact that Ginko was actively banning these users, claiming it was creating a divide and that he would be more active, claiming that a larger mod team was no longer necessary. Despite this, Zaktastic decided to add[ three more moderators ](https://www.reddit.com/r/bioniclelego/comments/vq2p3w/say_hello_to_the_new_mods/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)to the sub. All of which, in the span of a few hours, have displayed incredibly immature and homophobic behavior that proved to stir up more controversy in the community in response to backlash. Trying to \u201cwin\u201d fights with members of the community due to the community\u2019s support of LGBTQ+ ideals (hell, one of them, fici268, admitted to being homophobic under the announcement). Zaktastic has also gone on to ban non-mod members of the community due to their support of trans people in previous posts. Zaktastic has also gone on to say that the claims directed towards his new moderators are \u201cbaseless\u201d, despite their behavior proving otherwise.\n\n**WHAT NOW?**\n\nWell, it\u2019s hard to say due to this drama being only a few hours old, but it is glaringly clear that the larger community does not approve of these controversial and potentially harmful decisions. GinkoWeed , after explaining the situation, went on to report this coup of sorts to reddit staff to hopefully get something done. All sources in this report will be linked below. As for the new mod\u2019s behavior, that can be found in the comments section of several of the related posts on r/bioniclelego. Although I will warn you, they get quite nasty. I would not be surprised if I was banned off the subreddit for making this report here, lol.\n\nAnnouncement on \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/bioniclememes/comments/vpthju/meta\\_rbioniclelego\\_banned\\_its\\_two\\_active/?utm\\_medium=android\\_app&utm\\_source=share](https://www.reddit.com/r/bioniclememes/comments/vpthju/meta_rbioniclelego_banned_its_two_active/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\n\nCommunity backlash post 1\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/bioniclelego/comments/vq2v4h/the\\_b\\_in\\_lgbt\\_stands\\_for\\_bionicle/?utm\\_medium=android\\_app&utm\\_source=share](https://www.reddit.com/r/bioniclelego/comments/vq2v4h/the_b_in_lgbt_stands_for_bionicle/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) \n\nCommunity backlash post 2\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/bioniclelego/comments/vq117j/takanuva\\_says\\_trans\\_rights/?utm\\_medium=android\\_app&utm\\_source=share](https://www.reddit.com/r/bioniclelego/comments/vq117j/takanuva_says_trans_rights/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) \n\nGinkoweed\u2019s official statement\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/BIONICLE/comments/vpwqu7/so\\_lets\\_talk\\_about\\_zaktastic/?utm\\_medium=android\\_app&utm\\_source=share](https://www.reddit.com/r/BIONICLE/comments/vpwqu7/so_lets_talk_about_zaktastic/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) \n\nUpdate: Zaktastic has gone on to remove multiple posts of backlash from the community, I shall detail their contents if any of the leaks end up becoming dead ends.\n\nUpdate 2: one of Zaktastic's new mods (also one of the people he unbanned) has instated a new rule for the subreddit banning LGBTQ content in general. \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\n\nUpdate 3!: It has been *admitted* by one of the new mods that this takeover was planned in order to purge LGBTQ content off the subreddit. This is under the excuse of \"trying to protect children from an agenda\" despite most of the subreddit being composed of adults who can handle (and actively support and are a part of) LGBTQ movements.\n\nUpdate 4: As of this morning, the subreddit has been reclaimed by the original mods! Banning Zaktastic and his flying monkeys, and restoring order and pride to the subreddit. And so ends our tale, of the r/bioniclelego.",

They are very similar but there's a huge difference.  When you buy a lootbox or a pokemon card pack, you are purchasing a product in hopes of getting a specific skin/card/gun/etc. You go in understanding that you are going to lose some amount of money, whether its $10 or $1000, in hopes of getting a certain product. You hope that you don't need to spend too much to get what you want. Once you get that item, you're done and reached your goal.  If you bought 10 booster packs of a pokemon set and grabbed all the good cards in those 10 packs, you're not buying anymore. Same if you buy 10 loot boxes and get the epic skins that you wanted.  Thing with casino gambling is that for most people there is no end game. People go into slot machines or blackjack with hopes that they will spend no money at all, and in fact make money. If they end up winning big, it only emboldens most to continue gambling. Maybe they'll stop for that day, but most go back next week or next month, because they felt that rush of hitting big. If they're down, they know that there's just that 0.05% chance of all their losses being erased with one lucky hit.  People eventually stop buying loot boxes or card packs because they no longer care about getting that product. But cash is something everyone will want for the rest of their lives so getting hooked on casino gambling is much more detrimental.  I think streaming live gambling like slots is extremely irresponsible since most of the viewers are under 18 and easily influenced. They're getting fed the same addictive visual stimulus regular casino slot players get. Seeing their favorite streamer get a bonus hit and making 100k is giving them the same rush that the slot game designers want customers to feel.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/mx7zhm/moistcr1tikals_thoughts_on_the_lsf_community/gvmyonf?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n\\-[As a well educated academic:  This is charlie being stupid.

But he was opening the packs in search of particular cards. He gets those cards and he's out. \n\nMoreover, he's doing it entirely for his fans. He has fun opening a pack regardless of whether or not he gets that card because he'll be sending all of those packs to his fans anyways and he'll be joking about it all.\n\nThis may have gotten some folks who watched his stream to buy packs just like him. They might have seen him doing it and instead of understanding why he did so, they might have gotten hooked on the thrill. I'm not saying that it's likely or that it happened, only that it's possible.\n\nxQcOW was betting for money. There's a lose-case there. In moistcr1tikal's case, he always had fun. In xQcOW's case, he'd have fun if he won and he'd be betting for more money. If you're moistcr1tikal, you get your cards and you're out. If you're xQcOW, you get more money and then what? You get more money.\n\nIn xQcOW's case, the thrill is the content and that's an open gateway to gambling. In moistcr1tikal's case, the jokes and the fact that those cards will end up in the hands of his fans, that's the content.\n\nIn Trainwreckstv and xQcOW's case, we're talking about a site that's crypto-protected so that anyone can lie about their age with crypto-currency and enter. For Pok\u00e9mon cards, you'd need to go through eBay or Amazon, both of which need you to be 18 with a credit card.\n\nIt's not actually hypocritical to say that one is harmful and one is harmless.",

It's about the impression it leaves on the viewers and what it looks like to them. \n\nSure, he says he's just doing it for fun. But he talks about the value of the cards constantly as well... And him showing this to other people and generating excitement from it is something that gets other people to do it. Exactly the same as slot machine gambling.\n\nOr you could point out the video where his girlfriend had to confront him publicly about him lying about the money he spends on his cards. Because presumably private interventions weren't working. And then instead of acknowledging there's anything wrong with what he does he doubles down on it and makes a video attacking anyone who criticizes him for it.\n\nYou do realize those are some pretty big red flags for addiction in general, right? \n\nIt sounds like he doesn't do those videos anymore. But the people defending it are mistaking this concept of \"gambling versus card opening\" being different, when what is really being criticized here is *the advertisement of those things to a group of people that will be influenced by it.*\n\nYou can make arguments about card opening being different or having other kinds of value than just pissing your money away on slots. But the problem is when someone who can do either of those things with little to no genuine financial risk to themselves (and a financial incentive to do it because they will get their money back through views on their YouTube video) advertises it an impressionable audience as though it is \"just a fun thing to do!\"",

Yes.\n\nPlus, yeah with pokemon cards or what have you, it doesn't lead to addiction like how gambling in a casino does and most of the time people are collecting rather than flipping.

            "Why are you people so invested in these streamers",
            "I'm pretty sure the major difference between trading cards and gambling is that trading cards enable a trading economy. I'm not sure if this is true of the brand of cards used by mo1stcritikal but Yugioh, Magic: The Gathering, Pok\u00e9mon, and even baseball cards allow people to sell and trade their cards. Gambling doesn't allow that by no means. The creation of an economy and letting that economy be handled by players is what reduces the negative effects of gambling.",
            "Wow ... a lot to unpack. Thanks for pulling it all together. Now for my opinion: It is either willful or unintentional ignorance to equate buying and selling items based on manufactured scarcity (the \"cardboard\") to the devastating effects caused by on-line gambling (leaving poker aside for a moment). I only know what from the studies I've read, what I've experienced personally, or learned about anecdotally, but online \"casinos\" are brutal. Unlike a brick-and-mortar gambling parlor, winners can't walk out with their winnings. This is a huge distinction. If one is lucky enough to win $400k, most likely they will be allowed to withdraw $2,500 to $10k at a time, at most. The expected result is that the so-called winnings end up getting turned back into action and ultimately lost. The design of the games, the process of playing, the methods of depositing money (easy) and withdrawing it (difficult), coupled with the invincible aura of young men (and to a lesser but equally damaging extent young women), all lead to inevitable loss, sometimes just a little, but frequently in the 10s of thousands.\n\nWhatever the depth of one's addiction to playing cards, it is NOT the same thing. Sure, someone can spend and spend and rack up ridiculous losses, but I would argue (anecdotally of course) that the number of people afflicted by \"cardboard\" obsessions and the amount of loss sustained by them is not even in the same statistical playing field.",
            "This whole thing just shows streamer culture is inherently toxic and a race to the bottom tbqh.",
            "I mean, those pokemon cards actually have value no matter what you get. It's still a gamble, but in the end you are always left with something that has value close to what was spent, the gamble is the possibility of getting even better than average cards, not getting something better OR nothing at all.",
            "I recently got into crash gambling because everyone's livestreaming it. The first time I put in $20, lost it, put $15 in, lost most of it, then I won $110 and stopped so I came out positive. Tried playing again a week later, I just had $20 for food and gas to work deliveries the next day and lost it all so I had to buy gas with quarters. I still won more than I lost but I'm not doing that shit again until I can actually afford to lol. I did have a lot of fun the game feels like you're doing real cocaine so it's a little dangerous.",

If you look at Act 4 and 5, you'll see that the winning gifs only have a score of around 300 or so. Lets assume that every single one of those votes came from someone who had the plugin installed. That means that a group of 300 or more redditors could easily compete with this discord server. There are only ~600 users on the sequence narrator's discord. Compare that to Reddit's [542,000,000 monthly active users](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit).\n\nIn my opinion, this title has it backwards. Reddit gave up on the experiment, which then lead to the discord running the show. Right out of the gate, it was really confusing for the average user. The rules weren't clear, there were a lot of bugs, constant changes to how sequenced worked, and the the website for it was so painful to use. Reddit gave up to the point where one tiny discord server was the main source of participation. \n\nMany of the people on the discord were users involved in the ARG that lead up to the release of this experiment. They were the try-hards. They were the people who would make a browser extension, discord server, excel spreadsheet, and the occasional custom gif. If they didn't care about it then no one else would. /r/HighQualityGifs could have been all over this and yet there was nothing.\n\nTo me it seems that the discord is being used as a scapegoat for another Arpil Fool's experiment that wasn't as good as /r/Place. I understand the users who disagree with the browser extension, but I think it is unfair so say that they ruined the experiment.

Back when I was (poorly) making mods for Bethesda games, some guy kept messaging me on Nexus demanding that I make a mod to remove the gay couple from Fallout 4\u2019s opening. Given that they\u2019re background NPCs that die a couple of minutes in, have no lines beyond generic ones, and 99% of players (including me, before this) have never noticed them, partially because everyone who plays FO4 skips the bloody into after the first time, it seemed fairly absurd. But he kept on sending messages insisting that I did so, even offering to pay for it. Fucker was obsessed.\n\nHe eventually discovered that all of FO4\u2019s companions are bi as well (as in Skyrim), and went to try and pressure a different mod author to change that.\n\n\nThe weirdest things are that a) at the time I only made simple retexture mods and the like, nothing like what he wanted, and b) the thing he eventually offered $50USD for was like a three-minute job even if you aren\u2019t familiar with the Creation Kit.

You can see this historically. Racism only became a thing to legitimise colonial $$$ making.\n\nIf that event, and events like it, hadn't happened then being racist would make as much sense as being \"earlobeist\", or some other difference that we *feel* is trivial.

If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.\u2014In this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be most unwise. But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols. We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant. We should claim that any movement preaching intolerance places itself outside the law, and we should consider incitement to intolerance and persecution as criminal, in the same way as we should consider incitement to murder, or to kidnapping, or to the revival of the slave trade, as criminal.\u201d \n\n...and your only takeaway is:\n\n>that meme image is stupidly oversimplified and Popper would probably hate it.\n\nYou have to completely not read the quote to believe something that fucking stupid. \n\nDoes the meme boil Popper's idea down to, perhaps, a slightly reductionist level?

        "selftext": "So recently in a podcast featuring the crew behind the recent She-ra Princess of Power reboot, twitter ended up exploding in a firestorm of drama over things said in a podcast. A lot happened, but basically the drama is summed up as \n\n1. The cast saying 2 characters are autistic representation when some disagree.\n\n2. Calling a black character (who doesn't even show up in the show) \"working the field\" Sow\n\n3. Calling a non-binary character a pedo.\n\n4. A cis-het man said dyke.\n\nAll of this sounds bad out of context, and twitter took that lack of context to the fucking bank calling the creator a [racist](https://twitter.com/greatgalaktyka/status/1298829614572335104?s=20) and saying [she needs to pay reperations](https://twitter.com/greatgalaktyka/status/1298833547843731457?s=20).The creator, Noelle Stevenson almost immediately apologized [here](https://twitter.com/Gingerhazing/status/1298809959149211652?s=20). This is looking BAD for the creators, but then that ole pesky thing called [context](https://twitter.com/ArchineerLock/status/1298827799520849920?s=20) comes in and all of a sudden an easy explanation to everything they said:\n\n1. The cast never said they had good autistic representation, they were reading a fan mail.\n\n2. The big one, this one requires more words. So in She-ra there is a character named Bow and he has brothers although they are never seen, so in a post [here](https://twitter.com/Gingerhazing/status/1298803688677367810?s=20) in the podcast they were joking that all of Bows brothers would have names that rhyme with his, so they asked \"who is the brother that likes tilling seeds\" when the creator said \"Sow\" a word that, to my knowledge has no racial connotations as all farmers kinda have to sow. Does this stop twitter? of course not.\n\n3. Basically the enby character in question here is [Double Trouble](https://she-raandtheprincessesofpower.fandom.com/wiki/Double_Trouble#:~:text=She-Ra%20and%20the%20Princesses%20of%20Power%27s%20Characters%20,Razz%20%E2%80%A2%20...%20%201%20more%20rows%20), a shapeshifting lizard, all they said was that they observe people to imitate them, which is kinda creepy, but they're  a villain, so. \n\n4. This one is a real meme, so dyke is already a fairly well reclaimed slur, and the guy in question was literally signal boosting a lesbian podcast called Desperate Housedykes, and he was literally told by the HOSTS that it was fine if he said it. Either way he apologized. \n\nThis is Twitter, on to the main She-ra subreddit R/PrincessofPower there were a ton of threads  that were deleted by mods now, but the main difference here is the response of people who heard the news without seeing the contexts and those who did. \n\nCeddit is our lord and savior(deleted she-ra reddit posts).\n\nhttps://snew.notabug.io/r/PrincessesOfPower/comments/ihjr1z/here_are_my_thoughts_on_the_socalled_controversy/\n\nhttps://snew.notabug.io/r/PrincessesOfPower/comments/ihha2u/everyone_else_is_giving_their_opinions_so_imma/\n\nhttps://snew.notabug.io/r/PrincessesOfPower/comments/iheh9z/thread_of_the_moments_from_the_panel_that_are/\n\nhttps://snew.notabug.io/r/PrincessesOfPower/comments/ihe9x9/the_sow_clip/\n\nhttps://snew.notabug.io/r/PrincessesOfPower/comments/ihd0sz/what_the_shera_crew_said_in_todays_panel_really/",

She's about as progressive as they come. Reading through the accusations, I was ***not even a little*** surprised to see that the quotes were being taken out of context\n\nProgressive Twitter is so strange to me. They're super quick to jump to conclusions and will throw their closest allies under the bus at the slightest provocation.

            "I have a sneaking suspicion that the \"noise\" is bad faith shenanigans from the same crowd that has been dumping on PoP ever since the first character sketches were revealed. \n\nThe trolls couldn't disrupt the excitement over the series so now, they're looking for cracks in the armor and exploiting them.",
            "I had no idea gingerhaze was so big now! Their comics were always very progressive and I think they've handled this situation in the best possible way you could regardless of whether or not you believe they made a mistake. Not getting defensive but giving a genuine apology and explanation of the context.\n\nHopefully that side of the community will be able to step back and realize how wildly out of context things were and are just as able to apologize and admit to the misunderstanding.",
            "God, Twitter shit like this is just exhausting to even witness as an outside observer; I can't imagine what it's like to be the brunt of it.\n\n\"Intent doesn't matter; people were hurt\" is kind of a useless idea if people arrived at their feeling based off a completely bad-faith interpretation of the words of the \"offender\". I've seen this time and time again on Twitter where people take the least generous interpretation possible of someone's words when they speak in a setting that can easily be stripped of context (typically in an interview or a single tweet). They've arrived at their feelings not because of what the creator said, but because they're looking for these bad-faith readings everywhere they look - Twitter has conditioned them for that (and also are likely chasing clout for themselves. This person plugging their own content off these is clearly one of those.)\n\nIn this regard, I wish the creator didn't apologize. I understand why they did, given the community-sphere that they exist in, but christ, it just encourages this behavior further.",
            "I try to keep cancel culture drama at an arms length. In the age of Trump I just can't handle it. \n\nI have noticed that artists like Doja Cat and Cardi B, who get \"cancelled\" seemingly every day and don't fall all over themselves to validate the mob, continue to stay relevant while their transgressions fall by the wayside. \n\nMaybe that's just the luxury of being at the top of your field. I'd like to think if I were a content creator that'd be the path I'd take. Though it must be hard for any artist to not want to justify their work or make right with who they think are their fans.",
            "I wish people would stop apologizing for everything. If Twitter wants to have some bullshit tirade just let them. Don't apologize and feed into it. They think they're justified.",
            "Stop apologizing for doing nothing wrong for God's sake. It just makes them think they're justified.",
            "The Double Trouble stuff is like... what? I just went and watch the stream and there's absolutely nothing to suggest anything like what people are claiming. She just said Flutterina was real and that Double Trouble watched her to imitate her. Same goes for the Entrapta and Hordak stuff... like you said, just responding to a fan letter.\n\nI understand the objection to \"dyke,\" but the podcast's name is \"Desperate Housedykes.\" If either of the people objected to him using the word \"dyke\" I'm sure they would have spoken up. This feels like a nonissue to me, as a person who spent most of their early adult life in a sapphic environment where people used \"dyke\" all the time. Using the name in a title is completely different from calling a random lesbian a dyke.\n\nI do think Noelle goofed on the Sow thing. Talking about a Black character \"tilling the fields\" is just one of those things that's going to evoke slavery for a lot of people. She didn't mean anything by it, but in the larger context of the US's history of racism (and she is based out of the US as are many of the fans) it's in poor taste and comes across as almost a dogwhistle (even though of course it isn't one). But the expectation of perfection we have of creators is a little over the top. I think we need to learn to accept that they make mistakes and also be ready both to call them in on their errors and to encourage them to learn and do better. Sounds like she really did think about it, realized she fucked up, and offered a sincere apology.",
            "These are all non-issues, but i really respect that Noelle is taking them as seriously as the people who are upset by them. She's a fantastic creator and does her best to make minorities feel heard.",
            "legit deactivated my twitter over this shitshow. people make mountains out of molehills and will take snippets of shit that\u2019s hardly problematic just to RAGE all over the interwebs so they seem so \u201cwoke\u201d or whatever. noelle gave us a gift. she-ra is a gift. my old gay ass cried bc of the representation on this show and these couch \u201cactivists\u201d wanna make her seem like she was secretly evil the whole time. over it.",
            "This is exhausting.",
            "I feel really bad for Noelle during all of this. I follow her on twitter and she seems like a genuinly great person who cares about, and put a lot of effort into, making her works diverse and representative. For someone like her to be harrassed so harshly for something that frankly should offend no one when given the proper context really shows how twitter is the crab bucket of social media.",
            "Yeah I mean, some of this sounds iffy to me and I don't think it was a big overreaction to apologize for saying this stuff, but like . . . I don't understand why everyone's reacting as if she said the N-Word. They're not happy with her apology either, I saw people I follow cracking down on her for referring to what she said as a \"careless comment\" instead of \"admitting\" that she and her crew are racist. As if self-flagellation is a good look in an apology. \n\nA *lot* of the criticism of Stevenson, someone whose work I have never really personally enjoyed, seems to fall into the same toxic patterns discussed by Sarah Z in her video essay [Double Standards and Diverse Media.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__ctRfI7cuM) I really think people need to take a step back and look at the bigger picture when this stuff happens, otherwise we're perpetuating a system where nb lesbians get taken down harder for making an arguably thoughtless joke about farming than white straight dudes do for saying the N-word in a 'heated gaming moment.'",
            "Jesus Christ, people are going insaneeee",
            "what the fuck is a cis-het?",
            "I don't know if anyone is going to see this, but I really hope a majority of people see this like everyone in this thread does. Noelle is a fantastic showrunner and writer who helped create one of the most inclusive and representative shows through great storytelling, and it would be an absolute shame if she got \"canceled\" for something as silly as this.",
            "I have this theory that the bar for being canceled on Twitter as a cishet white male is literally being a rapist and the bar for anyone else is saying something shitty on twitter.\n\nLike, there is a thousand reasons for that both good and bad but...there's a hard ceiling to Twitter a platform for political change.",
            "I deleted twitter for a reason. They always care about the shit that DOES NOT MATTER. Some leftists/progressives are out here trying to make real change happen and these self-righteous shitlords bother themselves with the most trivial shit in the worst faith because they like being fucking angry. EDIT: to add on, the worst part is that they always attack the people who are trying their hardest to be good allies, which often tends to be marginalized people. The leftist purity testing and perfectionism requiring has got to fucking stop. How are people gonna get on our side and HELP US ENACT POLICY if we dont let them in?!",
            "I\u2019m so confused by this. What the hell was the offensive part of this and why did the person apologize?",
            "Re number 4 I'm generally not a fan of straights using 'dyke', to me it's kinda like 'f*g' in that unless you fit the definition then it's not your place to use it. Words that were/are used against a group by a majority group can't just be thrown around by that majority once the oppressed groups reclaim them. Same reason it's not OK for white people to throw around the n-word (I realise these aren't quite on the same level, but you get the idea). The thought of the people who used to bully me in high school by calling me a dyke now thinking it's an OK word to throw around in casual conversation is pretty nauseating. \nBut the context he used 'dyke' in is entirely appropriate and ridiculous to get mad over.\n\nI love She-Ra but my god online fandoms, just in general, are absurd.",
            "This is one of the most overblown things a Twitter fandom has ever done. Absolutely fucking embarrassing. Not a single thing that the cast did was cancel worthy. This just feels like drumming up drama for clout",
            "Surprise! Twitter is a shitty echo chamber with crappy reception",
            "Wowzers. This is some top tier cringe right here. One person on Twitter calls this \"Noelle\" person and members of the live stream panel \"Cracker Compadres.\" Yep, there's absolutely nothing ironic about that at all.",
            "\"Pay reparations\" ffs she raised over $40k a few months ago for BLM. She attends protests and was hit with a police baton and had her phone confiscated at one.",
            "It's shit like this that makes fighting for social justice hard. This is the type of shit that makes us look like loons. This is all imagined Boogeyman shit, and I don't know how someone could interpret things this badly.",
            "Sigh\n\nI was on twitter as this was going down\n\nAnd like. Out of context a lot of this can be yikes\n\nBut this spiral took me back to my tumblr days in a bad, bad way.",

Like, when they went into hiding, they left Bow a coded message: *What did the First One say when they burned dinner? It was ruined.* Because they're hiding in the ruins. Bow even had this dead look on his face when he read the message, it was hilarious.\n\nBow's brothers have been mentioned in passing, but not named iirc. All we know is they chose \"safe\" careers and Bow is the only warrior. Seeing the picture with their names shows the team went ham on pairing the name puns. I think Gogh is my favorite, even has a bandage on his ear (hopefully he didn't do that to himself.)\n\nIt also makes a ton of sense that it was people (probably maliciously) taking everything out of context. The show is one of the most diverse and inclusive shows out there, rivaling even Steven Universe. The accusations made no sense.",

The Senate voted and approved the 2019 amendment 68-23, with the vast majority of republican voting Yes. Three votings no, and seven not voting. \\[Vote Total\\] The bill advanced to the House where it died. This is unpopular with Republicans and is mixed with democrats.

As with all wars the ones who try to stay out of it are usually the ones affected the most. /r/The_Donald and /r/Sweden alike are beginning to receive some flak for keeping this up.\n\n[The moderators of /r/Sweden have responded to the issue at hand](https://np.reddit.com/r/sweden/comments/4erm9b/notice_of_increased_moderation/) and are taking it very seriously.\n\n[Strawpoll to gauge the community opinion on this](http://strawpoll.me/7370645)\n\n/r/The_Donald has been featured in [an MSNBC article making them out to be internet trolls](http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/how-donald-trumps-army-trolls-took-over-reddit)\n\nBig but not as huge Edit:\n\n/r/The_Donald has since removed their post where they have stopped enforcing moderation of racism regarding the middle east in their sub and have since [made this post](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/4es21f/psa_we_never_got_rid_of_our_no_racism_rule_were/). There's not much more to the post besides the title, so I'll copy and past it here: \"PSA: We never got rid of our \"No Racism\" rule. We're only allowing islamophobia. Its the rest of reddit, not us, that said otherwise.\"\n\nAnother Update: /r/Sweden has added a post titled [\"When /r/The_Donald needs to learn a lesson (translated)](https://np.reddit.com/r/sweden/comments/4eqsyi/n%C3%A4r_rthe_donald_beh%C3%B6ver_l%C3%A4ra_sig_en_l%C3%A4xa/). /r/Sweden is becoming divided, some calling the post about 9/11 hypocritical, others calling it a low blow, while some cheer it on from the downvoted comments section.\n\n#Huge Edit #3\n\nSo as this post nears its 1 day anniversary, we've had a lot happen here.  Since my last update this incident has really taken reddit by storm, with several dozen posts reaching the front page directly related to it. \n\nNotch (Markus Persson) even commented about it on twitter [here](https://twitter.com/notch/status/720681447741353984)\n\n/r/Sweden has decided that mejmejs are in fact fuktiga, but has made what I personally think is a smart move by closing the subreddit for the night. Posts can still be viewed and voted on but /r/Sweden lacks the sheer modforce to manage the posts swarming in. All submissions are restricted until 0800 Central European Time (About 3:00 AM Eastern Standard Time). After that time the subreddit is to return to \"normal\" which presumably means that there won't be any more banter coming from that end of the playing field. Whether or not /r/The_Donald continues the banter is yet to be seen as of now. [Here is the /r/Sweden post announcing the subreddit's downtime](https://www.reddit.com/r/sweden/comments/4etfe2/thanks_for_today_sweddit_is_taking_a_short_break/)\n\nI think this will end up going down as one of the more dramatic subreddit wars we've seen here. I'm not sure if more will unfold to make another large edit for, and if there isn't I'd like to thank everyone who participated. The final Strawpoll results [(Shown here)](http://strawpoll.me/7370645/r) show /r/Sweden with a devastating victory over the public's opinion. If anyone has any additional information as it unfolds, or just general suggestions for the post, please do not hesitate to message me and I will add it to the post after verifying it. This has been a hell of a ride today and I'm really glad I got to be up here working on this. \n\n\nFinal Piece unless something *big* comes up.\n\n/r/The_Donald has interpreted Sweden's choice to close up shop for the night [as a victory](np://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/4etm0a/rsweden_surrenders_victory/). Thoughts? Comments? What did you guys think about this? Is there anything I can do to improve the quality of my next SRD post (assuming there is one)? \n\nLast Update for real now. If anything else large happens it should be put in a new thread. \n\n/r/Sweden has [released a final statement on the events.](https://www.reddit.com/r/sweden/comments/4evo4p/the_borkening_aftermatch/) They have begun to call this \"The Borkening.\" A play off of \"The Fappening.\" For those unaware this was when hundreds of celebrity nudes were released en mass during an apple cloud leak. In relevance to /r/Sweden's final post, within it you can find the moderator's final statements on the matter, growth statistics for the sub, as well as a plethora of reports and modmails that the mods found worthy of sharing. (Reminder, please do not brigade users listed in modmail or reports. Don't shit in the popcorn!)",

            "As someone who's been on that sub for a while, while I definitely am uncomfortable with some of the more hateful comments on there, I do think its a net positive.  It shines a light as a cautionary tale, its cathartic to the frustration many have been feeling since the start of the pandemic with a lot of these people, as well as its convincing people lot get vaccinated as every day you see people posting that they decided they didn't want to be a winner after reading the sub. That last point especially I think justifies it's existence. But also, as I've said in other posts/subs, its literally just the Darwin awards: covid edition. \n\nI also think the people complaining are in no position to do so, as this really is just highlighting the most hateful people in the \"consequences of my own actions\" group, anyone who spends a bit of time looking at what the 'award winners' are posting can see that. And the pearl clutching comes off as disingenuous when its \"only 1% of the population dies no big deal\" and then \"how dare you point out someone is responsible because of their own poor choices/attitude\". \n\nAs far as the changes the mods made? Yea it makes sense. People shouldn't be harassing people on Facebook. I'm also not a fan of doxxing people. I get the argument that the impact is bigger the way it was, but you can't trust the internet to behave a lot of the time.

No, I don't want to unite with them and no I don't like them and I don't think I ever will.\n\nBut, the people who said this was probably not a good look, to mock them and their families for dying from their own poor decisions, are probably correct. It's probably not a good look to even just point out that they died due to their own actions. It's all just better left unsaid as annoying as that might feel given how awful they act on a regular basis. I hate that the answer is just to ignore these folks' behavior, but it's probably the correct thing to do.",

            "> you could get away with saying gay people were all involved in some massive conspiracy to destroy the American family until very, very, recently. Like last 5-10 years recently. Among other things. If you use that phrase today you're liable to get lynched. And that's just a small example. Even republicans avoid that doozy even though every single one of them was saying it non-stop in 2007. \n\nWhere are these mythical Republicans that won't happily talk about LGBT people destroying the American family?",
            "Oh boy, 40K drama, something that's always bound to be completely rational and sensible. \n\nThe 40k fandom has a really, really awful group of people, and it makes me a little upset that they think they're the centre of the fandom and the 'real fans'. What makes it worse is the idea that those people come off as what most 40k fans are like.\n\nThese goddamn assholes who think 40k is some pro-fascist, pro-genocide, anti \"Whatever group I hate here\" thing. They've got absolutely miserable comprehension skills. In fact, its likely because these people have never actually read any of the material, and whose only knowledge of the setting comes from the fucking shitty memes and less then reputable YouTube lore videos. \n\nI don't want to sound like I'm gatekeeping, since I do believe the only metric to be called a fan is if you enjoy something. But goddamn, it annoys me when I see people whose comprehension of the setting is so fundamentally horrendous, yet they act so self-assured that they're right. \n\nGames Workshop, the company who makes Warhammer, has said they don't want people who aren't welcoming in the community. Pretty reasonable statement, yet it made all these 'true fan's' all riled up. Why would they get angry at a message like that? \n\nThese 'true fans' like to think the Imperium is the good guys. Fucking what? \n\nEvery single 40k book begins with a passage that describes the Imperium as 'the cruellest and most bloody regime imaginable.' \n\nThey'll say the Imperium is the good guys because the alternative is worse. Well, there are plenty of aliens, like the Orks, Tyranids, Necrons etc that are worse (since they'd kill all of humanity, given the chance). HOWEVER, there's thousands upon thousands of alien civilisations that are just totally innocent the Imperium wipes out because it doesn't care. Thousands of human cultures the Imperium has wiped out because they wouldn't join/wanted independence. The Imperium is an awful, awful place to live in led by awful people. Some places are better then others, sure, but even the 'peaceful' worlds are still under the Imperium's heel. \n\nAs for this drama...40k in general does shy away in general from depicting anything explicitly sexual (Because we all know, excessive violence is good, but sex is a no-no). However, there's nothing really touching upon the subject of what the Imperium thinks of LGBT+ people. The Imperium probably doesn't care. Some planets might, most probably want, a lot could be like ours where it even varies on the same world.\n\n I'd like to think Games Workshop supports LGBT+ rights and all that, its just that 70% of 40k literature is about giant men in power armour killing aliens and/or other giant men in power armour. Not exactly something that lends itself to social commentary beyond depicting how fucking awful war is and how it makes everyone into monsters. Of course, even if there was deeper commentary, these idiots would miss it in when they can't even grasp the whole 'War fucking sucks' message that defines 40k. \n\nSeriously, if you miss out on that point, that 40k is critical of war and condemns it, that conflicts breeds conflict and only creates more problems, and the rather pessimistic view that all life is inherently defined by its own self-destructive nature, you're really missing what 40k is about.\n\nEveryone fucking sucks. Every faction is bad in some way or another, but believes themselves justified. Some own up to this, like the Dark Eldar, who know they're fucking assholes. Some genuinely believe they're right, like the Imperium. Others, like the Tyranids, just follow their nature. Point being, everyone in 40k is shades of very dark grey, so you don't feel terrible about reading about their endless conflicts or blowing up your friends army in games of make believe model soldiers. \n\nThe idea that ANYONE would look to anything in 40k and thinks \"Yes, this is a reasonable way we should behave in real life,\" rather then going \"Hmm, this sure looks like its saying war and violence are terrible and only a truly nightmarish world would relish it\" needs to pick up a 40k book and read it. \n\nThey need to think about how 40k is depicting a nightmare scenario where endless, inescapable conflict has become normalised and the idea of peace so foreign its unimaginable. Seriously, its not called the Grim Darkness of the Far Future for nothing. Its meant to be fucking bleak. You're not meant to idealise anything depicted in it. \n\nIt always annoys me when the drama in a 40k sub isn't related to \"X Army is overpowered and this means the game designers are biased and/or incompetent\" or \"X character beats Y character and here's my 3000 page essay explaining why.\" \n\nMakes me annoyed to think I enjoy the same thing as assholes who get offended because someone who isn't exactly like them is enjoying their hobby.",
