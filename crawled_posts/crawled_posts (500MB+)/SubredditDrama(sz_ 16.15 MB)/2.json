It's created huge problems in European and other countries (many of whom - France and Britain especially - are complicit) that have had to deal with the consequences of US military actions and their proxy wars.\n\nIt's also led to an increase in far right extremism and anti-immigrant rhetoric within those countries, none of which ever acknowledges that the root cause of mass immigration is imperialism and war. Look at Yemen and the 'quiet war' between a group of imperialist nations, using that country as their staging ground rather than fighting on each others turf. \n\nI think everyone can agree that the ideals that America was built upon are wonderful. But you have to live up to those ideals every single day and America - in particular the right wing (I hesitate to even call them Republican as they no longer subscribe to any traditional interpretation of Republicanism) - have not only failed to live up to those foundational ideals but ground them into the dirt. \n\nMost people don't even consider the Democrats left wing politically, they're moderate to right wing by Euro standards, bar a few folk like Bernie Sanders who would, frankly, be moderate left in many Euro countries.

            "Conservatives are the minority. Always have been. Always will be (thankfully).\n\nProgress is human nature. Since the beginning of time, there has always been a vocal minority who has spoken out against change. But the keywords here are \"vocal minority.\" They're often loud, flashy, and group together, giving the illusion that their beliefs are widespread. In a pack, they can even seem intimidating when the majority of the population is passive. But it is important to remember that they are only the minority and do not represent humanity, neither locally nor internationally.\n\nThe Internet has connected humanity in a way that was never possible before. For the vocal minority, it has given them a platform to unite and (once again) provide the illusion that their views are popular. However, for the global consciousness that strives to move ever forward, The Internet also provides an outlet for everyone to unite and collaborate, further driving progress.\n\nI imagine it is a pretty scary time for conservatives. Never in humanity's history has forward-thinking and progress been so unified, transparent, and seemingly an inevitable forgone conclusion.  The global consciousness has become more focused and committed toward achieving humanity's future progress on a wide range of fundamental levels.\n\nI can sit here forever, trying to calmly explain why this can be an excellent thing. But for conservative, fear is getting the best of them. They are afraid and fearful people can become dangerous. We see this in the recent protest (proud boys, for example).  When acts of violence or threats of violence fail to work, they can become confused and attempt to try to self-rationalize.  In this instance, that is what is happening in r/Republican. They are trying to explain to themselves why their views and beliefs are not the majority. At the moment, their consensus is that unseen outside influences must be at play. Still unable or unwilling to accept that their views are simply being rejected by the collective consciousness of humanity.",

No, your consent is not violated if someone is wearing leather or you overhear them talking about their relationship, but.also yes exposing yourself to someone is breaking consent, it's the same way you wouldn't send dick pics to people either.

Even in relatively liberated SF, the parade is around four hours of floats that are mostly unexciting. It will be firefighters, public officials, civic orgs, churches, cultural orgs, and businesses. Only at the very end are there a handful of floats where people might be in speedos and maybe a harness. It\u2019s almost PG rated compared to straight people at Kentucky Derby or Mardi Gras. There are after parties that can get racier, but those are cordoned off without kids being allowed. And then the BDSM community is even stricter on making sure their events are in a space where people are fully informed on what they\u2019re getting into before they\u2019re in viewing distance. The parade itself is so dull compared to the sodom and Gomorrah that people infer based on a couple pics.",

            "Goodness, I\u2019m getting old. \n\nMy wife worked for an AIDS organization decades ago and they had a float in the NYC gay pride parade. That was fun! Before the parade we wandered up the streets to look at the costumes and floats to admire the sights. Some of the \u201ckinky\u201d costumes were really well done, though the guys had the bodies for them. Aside from being topless I don\u2019t remember the lesbians. From what I remember it was very open and accepting of all. It was so friendly. \n\nThat said, there were also many more \u201cconservative\u201d participants and parade watchers dressed in average clothing, including my former manager (he was out and he was my mentor when I worked for him, we were just happy to see each other again \u2014 20 plus years later and we still chat). But I think that was part of out ages at that point, 30s and 40s. We were older, not the \u201ckids\u201d who were dressing up. The same is true for my current friends and family. My children are friends with the younger generation and they act like kids. \n\n2000 was our only parade. 2001 we were parents of a new born. Then came 9/11 which freaked my wife out so much we moved to the burbs. \n\nTl;tr: have fun, you\u2019re young only once",
            "What\u2019s really offensive is pride making me pay $13 for a fuckin blue moon",
            "As a straight guy my opinion on this doesn\u2019t, and shouldn\u2019t, matter in the least. I just want to say that I live in Long Beach where we have an awesome Pride parade. I go every year, and there\u2019s a bunch of \u201ckinky stuff\u201d, and it\u2019s always a fucking blast!",

            "I come here because Jerry Springer no longer airs.",
            "I\u2019m so out of the loop because here I\u2019m thinking that everyone is talking about water sports and scat play not being appropriate for a day time parade with children possibly attending\u2026 and it seems to boil really down to someone wearing a freaking pup mask\u2026 next you will tell me that people are upset with Drag Queens who read to children at Public Libraries or something\u2026",
            "Once again conservatives showing that they do not follow pride events, have no idea if pictures they see are from yesterday or 2002 and don't care, do not watch pride events, but have super strong emotional opinions about them and assertions that everything they say happens at every pride parade to a ridiculous degree even during COVID when there were none",
            "What is \u201cthe kink community\u201d? As a gay man myself, I have no idea what that even means. I can obviously gather the main idea but was this a particular community in a certain city, or is \u201ckink community\u201d more of a general term?",

            "So fun fact, the USA bdsm/kink community was essentially created by gay men. \n\nAfter WWII gay vets came home, were still not accepted for being gay, and also missed the structure and order of the military.\n\nSo gay men started going to gay bars and having power exchange in their relationships and having very very kinky sex. A lot of gay men started riding motorcycles and going to gay bars in other cities and states. When you ride a bike, you wear leather to protect yourself in case of an accident. So leather very quickly was common on gay men and included in their kinky sex. \n\nThey'd get patches on their leather of places they'd been, such as gay clubs, and this was a way to signal to other gay men who they were so they could all protect each other. So the leather became a cultural form of protection as well. It was also common, after having your kinky sex, to keep some of the leather the other person had to remember them or gift it to someone you cared about. \n\nThis slowly evolved into the leather community. Leathermen were common in LGBTQ spaces. Eventually, lesbians adopted these practices and leatherwomen were likely to be seen as well. All the while, kink and power exchange and fun stuff is being explored and developed. \n\nEventually, the leather community opened up to the straights. You could now be a straight person in the leather community, you could be gifted leather, and you could do all that kinky fun stuff with no judgements. \n\nKinks broaden, not everyone is into wearing leather, LGBTQ is less taboo so less need for that protection, and straights never really needed it to begin with. So people get into leather just for the kinks, then eventually only kink groups are made. Finally, BDSM/kink community exists and the leather community becomes a subculture of it. \n\nPeople need to learn LGBTQ history. Gay men created the kink community (at least in the States) so not wanting that at pride is some bullshit",
            "I read somewhere that this type of discourse was started by 4chan anti pride groups. Its supposed to make gay people seem overly sexual and pride seem like a scary orgy. Based on the discussions we have every year, I think it might be true.",
            "This is kind of amusing as they used to say the same thing about gay people kissing in public:\n\n\n\u201cNo one wants to see that\u201d, \u201cyou should do that in your bedroom, not in public\u201d\n\n\n\nSeriously it\u2019s the exact same thing they used to say about LGBT expressions!"

Laboratory test abnormalities include decrease in white cell count and elevated liver tests. \n\nThe creator of the drug has warned against its use in this manner.\n\nIt's just fashionable in the counter-culture covid-19 antivax crowd at this time.

It sounds shallow but when you have so many online personalities of all genders hammering so incessantly on the same thing and treating it as so important it will eventually get normalized. \n\nThen too there's the fact of Trump himself being the kind of man who places a ridiculous amount of emphasis on female hotness - the whole series of hot wives, beauty pageant owner, Access Hollywood tape thing that assholes insist is part of his \"brand of straight-talking appeal\".

Moderate/Centrist enough to appeal to a wide enough spectrum to say either candidate would be someone both sides could live with. A minority hispanic. A woman.  \n\nWhy did they promote Trump or Sanders? So far left and right that the majority of the country would be a distance from their ideology. Yes it can be argued that Trump and Sanders aren't far right or far left but the accusation carries weight with the spectrum further from the candidate. If you're a Trump supporter or a Sanders supporter you can still be proud of them for how outside the mainstream they were but we must recognize that they were, in fact, outside the mainstream. \n\nThe lesson here? We as a people need to reconcile our differences and entertain the idea that we need a leader who appeals to the majority of us. What will you be willing to let slide? Will you be willing to look at a Republican/Democrat and see a friend instead of an enemy? Will you find common ground? Will you be willing to listen to a liberal on healthcare?

        "selftext": "**Context:**\n\nOne attraction of Biden (primarily discussed on reddit) was the potential cancellation of student debt. This was seen as an ideal by progressives and was heavily pushed by popular figures (mostly on social media) such as AOC and Bernie Sanders. Biden had also made similar discussions on the subject and at one point, had promised too cancel $10,000 of student debt. The expectation has been driven further by many activists discussing the idea and pressuring his administration. However, in a sudden twist, the White House is set to restart student loan payments in February. \n\nThis sudden change in both reality and rhetoric has led to some soul searching and heated discussions on the future of the current Democratic party. Progressives, many of whom strongly dislike so-called 'Neoliberals' are disgusted at this and see it as a betrayal. Many progressives are becoming increasingly frustrated with current Democrat policies, threatening to sit out the mid-terms and the election. As a result, infighting within the Democratic support base has been rekindled. \nIn an environment of recent Progressive losses (Several mayoral campaigns across the country went to Republicans and Neoliberals, with few major progressive victories), the worst time to break apart would be now.\n\nNevertheless, Is it truly Biden's fault? Did he ever promise to cancel all these debts? Are the midterms finished? Who should shut their mouths, progressives of neoliberals? Is choosing not to vote principled or privileged? Should we vouch for accelerationism, revolution or protest? Is any criticism, legitimate or not, levied at the current administration Republican Obstructionism, and ultimately serving their interests? Are we a bunch of whiney babies for taking a loan and refusing to pay it back?

Why should a socialist be happy with a moderate liberal pro-capitalist party?",
            "This is why the best strategy progressives can take is ignore the presidency and focus on Congress/local elections. Presidents from the Democratic Party tend to be centrist, and even if they weren\u2019t, they will have no ability to enact anything that can\u2019t be overturned by the next president (who will inevitably be a fascist because the fear stirred up will distract people from any gain). Not to mention cults of personality suck and destroy everything eventually if you\u2019re not authoritarian. Real leftists would also say that the presidency is inherently imperialist, and that would not change no matter how progressive the person holding the title is, so basically that\u2019s one less progressive out there fighting. \n\nDemocrats have no reason to appeal to young people when they are not a reliable voting block. All the most reliable voting blocks in the Democratic Party lean centrist. The only way that would change is if we vote CONSISTENTLY. \n\nYou might say that this sort of strategy takes years, and I say\u2026yes, it does. We should have been stacking our cards for years, but we didn\u2019t, and now we\u2019re playing catch up. The worst thing we can do is to keep threatening to give up when our attempts at making up for the years of complete apathy don\u2019t work. That will just make it less appealing to try and appeal to us.",

He was against it during the primary and as far as I know all he's said is if a bill to forgive 10k in loans was put on his desk he'd sign it. But now all of reddit is trying to pretend he promised to cancel all student loan debt and he's not keeping promises he never even made.",

I get AOC says \"it will help inflation\" what she means is people struggling with bills can afford the more expensive things if they have student loan relief. but the fact is it will temporarily make inflation worse, which is what the dems are getting hammered on.\n\nMiddle america is just more concerned with inflation atm which affects 100% of us. where student loans relief only effects those with loans. dems are going to focus on the former first, it helps more.",

Their staff are also from the same schools and families.   \n\n\nthey are CLEARLY not the same but it doesn\u2019t mean our democray isn\u2019t co-opted by private intrest.

It costs the government more money to maintain the loans than they get from repayment. It\u2019s just screwing over generations of working people for no other reason than \u201ctough shit\u201d. The fact is even if he canceled 100% of it, there\u2019s still a lot left to do before the middle class in this country has a shot. This was step one. First they said the president couldn\u2019t cancel debt. Until he did for some. Now they\u2019re just not explaining why the White House and establishment democrats can\u2019t get on the same page.

Which if you are, that is fine, but do state that.  You spoke of progressive loses, but to hear people like economist Richard Wolff speak, their tone is that of progressive ideals becoming center stage.  neoliberals almost can't win an election, and conservatives bet on the culture war.  What should regular people look to exactly?",
            "The fact that trump denied covid and did nothing which resulted in him killing 500,000 Amerucans is reason enough to never vote for the GOP again. I don't care what Biden doesn't cancel.",
            "There seems to be a lot of different perspectives on what \u201cforgive student debt\u201d means.\n\nThere are people who think it means 10K of public loans for a public university, which is reasonable and something Biden mentioned in the past of doing.\n\nThen you get others who took private loans and are pissed that they would get nothing. I don\u2019t think that is Biden\u2019s or Democrats fault.\n\nAlso, there are people who went to private schools, accumulating over 100K in loans by the end of it. These people are also complaining their loans aren\u2019t being forgiven.\n\nAt some point people need to take responsibility for the actions they took. I get that it may have sounded like a good idea but taking out 100K-200K in loans and then asking to have it erased or else you won\u2019t vote is laughable.\n\nBy the way, trying to sell the idea of forgiving tens of thousands of dollars in loans to people that A. had a full time job just to make ends meet while in school or B. Paid off or almost done paying off their loans and C. People that couldn\u2019t afford college/took a different path will be a very tough sell.",
            "People heard what they wanted to hear and now are shocked that reality says they're not getting a pony-sized unicorn.\n\n[\u2018I will not make that happen\u2019: Biden says he will not support $50K in student debt forgiveness](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/17/biden-says-he-will-not-support-50k-in-student-debt-forgiveness.html)\n\n[Biden will call on Congress to forgive $10,000 in student debt for all borrowers](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/08/student-loan-forgiveness-could-be-more-likely-but-challenges-remain-.html)\n\nBiden's been pretty consistent about supporting student debt relief *to a point*. He's never been for blanket, no-questions-asked debt forgiveness. \n\nIf that means people will go third party or Republican in retaliation, that is their right. Good luck getting any sort of debt relief from them, though."

            "It feels like Reddit wants to try out all these different things, but has no commitment to actually follow through with them. I don't think they have any long term vision of what they want to be, or any plan on how to get there.\n\nA number of times they've introduced a new project with nothing more than a vague idea. Then no further direction is provided and a few months later the project is quietly killed. RedditMade (killed by a flood of shitty T-shirts no one wanted) and RedditNotes (killed by the fact no one even knew what the fuck they were) would fit in this category.\n\nStill, despite the lack of admin direction provided, some projects still manage to get off the ground. And yet they still somehow find a way to screw up these Reddit successes. The redditgifts marketplace was actually pretty good. It actually made money, and when combined with the gift exchanges was a very unique platform. So naturally the admins killed it, with zero warning.\n\nAMAs are also very successful and draw a huge number of new users to the site. It's certainly very unique to reddit. They've even built a stand alone app for them, so clearly this is something very important to the site. Victoria is obviously a huge part of the success... so naturally they get rid of her with zero warning.\n\nI realize there are a limited number of reddit admins, and they have limited resources, but this is ridiculous.

Aside from some fringe Catholic priests and the like, the idea of it being murder never crossed the minds of the conservative sphere, they just cared (somewhat justifiably) on the state's role and position.\n\nThen the \"Moral Majority\" GOP decided to rally the radicals to their cause and essentially astroturfed them into the pro-life movement of today, with millions of single-issues voters that'll stomach people like Trump, McConnell, and Newt because they run a pro-life platform.\n\nThese Christians need to realize that they're being played. Aside from the idea of \"life starts at conception\" isn't entirely biblicial with examples such as the Trial of Bitter Waters and literal infanticide, it's the same thing with the 2A hysteria. These politicians raise up a strawman caricature of the actual pro-choice position, lie about how abortions actually work and relevant organizations like Planned Parenthood in order to get your vote. Meanwhile, the pro-choice crowd are the ones pushing foster-care reform, maternity leave, comprehensive sex-ed, things that factually reduce abortion, but they've been so demonized that any dialogue is impossible.",

The child AND the mother died. Whether we like it or not, we cannot force our religious morals on others. This is a free country, and we have separation of Church and State. Further, the question of when a life begins can be measured a number of ways. In the extreme, you could say masturbation is murder. Some say that the child is not a separate life until it can survive outside the womb. Some say it is when the first heart beat occurs, which is long before brain activity. As a scientist, I believe that consciousness and being begins with brainwave activity. That\u2019s after week 6. \nThe law of the land, however, sets the minimum in limit at the second trimester. Beyond that, States are free to enact laws that do not interfere the fundamental right of people to choose. And you can\u2019t call abortion murder any more than I can call climate science denial the genocide of billions. Both cause deaths, but neither is a crime. Stop trying to force your radical Christian views on others. You are no better than ISIS extremists. You don\u2019t have a monopoly on God. \n\u201cGod is forcing Christianity back into America\u201d? That is both unChristian and unAmerican. Christians believe that faith cannot be forced, but must come from within, and is an act of love, not forceful aggression. Again, forcing their God is exactly what ISIS wants too. And in America it is illegal and unConstitutional to force God back in. \nIt sickens me that so many Evangelical and  Fundamentalist Christians are full of glee over the death of this great Patriot.

            "And how many pregnancies ended in miscarriage? Seems like God aborted those babies, no? \n\nBirth is the logical point at which a fetus transitions into personhood. Any point in a pregnancy prior to birth is a vague continuum, both from a medical technology perspective and from a fetal development perspective. The only other point in time that makes sense to consider as the beginning or personhood is conception. \n\nRealistically and practically, the society should be picking between birth or conception as the point at which personhood begins. Conception is logically an absurd point at which to begin this because of myriad reasons including privacy and rights of the mother, the large number of pregnancies that end early, the fact that many mothers have no idea that conception has even happened, and so on. \n\nWe're left with birth as the logical starting point for personhood.   \n\nThe SCOTUS precedent *has already made a compromise* to accommodate those people who believe personhood should start earlier than birth or at conception. We have already compromised on this point and have already ceeded ground to the less logical and less practical position. \n\nWhy is there no campaign to push the right of abortion back to birth? A fetus does not logically have independent personhood until birth. Why is no one arguing this?

As it stands, FDS seems pretty unscathed with basically only [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ikdj4d/process_changes_to_the_sub_flair_and_other/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) reacting to all the events. *However*, some action happened over at the original r/unpopularopinion thread.

It sparked the conversation regarding the fact that some women turn guys down just because they wanted them to try harder or to continue trying. The [top comment on that post](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/ik0w6p/if_youre_a_girl_and_turn_down_a_guy_because_you/g3ht1c3?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) talks about how on several relationship advice subs the message of \"no means no\" is pretty widespread. However, [the reply to that comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/ik0w6p/if_youre_a_girl_and_turn_down_a_guy_because_you/g3hxyms?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) says that the people over at r/FemaleDatingStrategy do not share that point of view. A little more digging by the redditors that saw that reply uncovers that the people at r/FemaleDatingStrategy are basically \"female incels\", which was amplified by the mods of that sub posting a pinned message basically saying that \"All male lurker's opinions are invalid, Did we ever ask for your thoughts?, etc\". I didn't quite get to read that post as as soon as I clicked on it I got distracted and when I came back to it the sub was locked, but the first few lines talked about one of the mods getting dm's about how her opinions/strategies are wrong. I guess we can all infer what happened to her inbox in the last few hours.\n\nJust wanted to get the word out there.

            "Hmm what an odd coincidence, I recently stumbled on there and can't even remember how. The main thing I remember is being kinda puzzled at how they emphasized women focusing on their career and not needing to be in a relationship or marriage, but on the other hand their FAQ said that if a man doesn't want to be exclusive with you within six weeks of dating or propose to you within one year (maximum), it means he wants you to be his second mommy and use you and he is therefore low value??? And you should also never live with a man before marriage for the same reasons. And if you have sex for the fun of it or before you're exclusive with someone or want to engage in casual dating, you're suddenly a lower valued woman or man who isn't realizing their potential.  Like, it's perfectly fine to have standards you set for yourself but these seem a bit extreme to prescribe to others.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere was also a post talking about how a man wanting to have sex in any position other than one in which you maintain full eye contact means that they're using you as a fleshlight or something. And it just kept being some odd discussion about how their partners always finish without them which just seemed pretty irrelevant. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLike there are some genuinely good pieces of advice in there but once you start drifting towards extreme orthodoxy and telling people that unless they do what you think is good, they're undervaluing themselves always seems troublesome.",

Like what goes on here?\n\nIt's basically just r/niceguys with a dash of \"you deserve the world sis\" there's no actual strategy or dating tips anywhere on that sub lmao. \n\nI must say though \"scrotes\" made me laugh, that one doesn't really bug me. \n\n\"LVM\" (low value male) however scares me. Not only would that never fly if it was LVF in some dude dating sub but it perpetuates the idea that it's not *who a man is* but rather what *he can do for you* that's attractive.",

They're still shitty people, but it's not like they're evil. They're like those kids who got bullied, and so they become bullies to regain some semblance of self esteem. Pretty sad, imo.",

The desperation in their posts is beyond anything I have seen.  They are literally the female incels.  Its the ONLY safe space on the internet for women?  Get the fuck out of here, thats the most toxic cesspool of despair I've seen outside 4chan.",

Are wholesellers present in every city? Of course they aren't. They are mostly situated in hub cities. Retailers purchase from them and sell them in their store. They are also taxed in this process. We are also paying for convenience. Also, websites directly sell those that's why the prices are less than retail. However, scalpers aren't giving any convenience.

If you scalp, you're a pitiful worm, but people keep buying them from you at scalping prices, so why *wouldn't* you keep doing it? Just like microtransactions in games, or broken pre-orders.

            "> Hate speech isn\u2019t a real thing defined by law, but whatever. \n\nThis is why we can't have nice things. There are so many laws that define hate speech...\n\n \n\n* Incitement to discrimination, hatred or violence against a person on account of race, colour, origin or national or ethnic descent, in the circumstances given in Article 444 of the Belgian Penal Code;\n* Incitement to discrimination, segregation, hatred or violence against a group, community or its members on account of race, colour, origin or national or ethnic descent, in the circumstances given in Article 444 of the Belgian Penal Code; and\n* Announcing the intention to commit any of the aforementioned offences, in the circumstances given in Article 444 of the Belgian Penal Code.\n\n The Racial Discrimination Act 1975 forbids hate speech on several grounds. The Act makes it \"unlawful for a person to do an act, otherwise than in private, if the act is reasonably likely, in all the circumstances, to offend, [insult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insult), humiliate or intimidate another person or a group of people; and the act is done because of the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of the other person, or of some or all of the people in the group.\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\n In [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada), advocating genocide against any \"identifiable group\" is an indictable offence under the [*Criminal Code*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Code_(Canada)) and it carries a maximum sentence of five years' imprisonment. There is no minimum sentence.[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech_laws_by_country#cite_note-5)\n\nPublicly inciting hatred against any identifiable group is also an offence. It can be prosecuted either as an indictable offence with a maximum sentence of two years' imprisonment, or as a summary conviction offence with a maximum sentence of six months' imprisonment. There are no minimum sentences in either case.[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech_laws_by_country#cite_note-6) The offence of publicly inciting hatred makes exceptions for cases of statements of truth, and subjects of public debate and religious doctrine. The landmark judicial decision on the constitutionality of this law was [*R v Keegstra*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_v_Keegstra) (1990).\n\nAn \"identifiable group\" is defined for both offences as \"any section of the public distinguished by colour, race, religion, national or ethnic origin, age, sex, sexual orientation, [gender identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity) or [expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_expression) or mental or physical disability\".[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech_laws_by_country#cite_note-7)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n Article 31 of the \"Ley sobre Libertades de Opini\u00f3n e Informaci\u00f3n y Ejercicio del Periodismo\" (statute on freedom of opinion and information and the performance of journalism), punishes with a large fine those who \u201cthrough any means of social communication makes publications or transmissions intended to promote hatred or hostility towards persons or a group of persons due to their race, sex, religion or nationality\".[\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech_laws_by_country#cite_note-8) This law has been applied to expressions transmitted via the internet.[\\[9\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech_laws_by_country#cite_note-9) There is also a rule increasing the penalties for crimes motivated by discriminatory hatred.",

            "Stolen comment from u/DeusExMarina that seems appropriate: \"\n\nLook, think of it this way: freedom necessitates limitations. If you allow everything, then you allow things that impact the freedom of others. Allowing murder, theft and slavery would obviously not be good for freedom. To protect the spirit of freedom, you need to put a few rules in place.\n\nSpeech is no different. Absolute free speech is fundamentally impossible for one simple reason: speech can have a chilling effect. If you allow a forum to become hostile to certain people, those people can no longer speak up without facing harassment. Let this keep happening unchecked and it can grow to a societal level, resulting in a national discourse in which marginalized people cannot safely participate.\n\nObviously, that\u2019s antithetical to free speech. True freedom of speech can only happen on a neutral, safe stage, and that\u2019s impossible when you\u2019ve got people banding together to harass the vulnerable.\n\nLike I said, freedom necessitates limitations. Absolute free speech is impossible. A choice not to silence hate groups is a choice to let them silence others. There\u2019s no neutrality. At some point, you\u2019ve got to take a stance and decide whose speech you want to protect more.\"",

Beyond anti-discriminations it also has an effect on the penal code regarding hate speech, \"People found guilty of hate speech face a fine or up to a year in jail for private remarks, and a maximum of three years in jail for public comments\" Things qualifying as hate speech are \" direct attacks against LGBTQ+ people or include language that intentionally dehumanizes them\".

            "I\u2019m a medical doctor in practice in the US and feel that, from what little the family was willing to reveal, I can comment on what must\u2019ve happened.  Bear in mind this is somewhat speculative as I have only what his family has revealed.  It\u2019s quite clear from his daughter\u2019s description that Jordan Peterson had delirium tremens.  DT is a condition of severe physiologic aberrations caused by withdrawal from either benzodiazepines or alcohol.  In my years of practice, I have usually found it in alcoholics who either cease drinking suddenly, or reduce their alcohol intake from their usual level of consumption.  Peterson\u2019s withdrawal was from benzodiazepines, a class of drugs used mostly to treat anxiety, or are used as sedatives for medical procedures.  His daughter complained that doctors in North America mishandled his addiction by giving him more drugs, but that isn\u2019t mishandling.  The treatment of any withdrawal state is to give the very agent of withdrawal, and then reduce the dose slowly, rather than abruptly.  What likely happened was that the family was not allowing doctors to help Peterson by applying a tapering dose of some benzodiazepine, which would\u2019ve been either diazepam, lorazepam, or oxazepam, to name the more common ones.  Because they kept refusing needed care, Peterson just kept having more withdrawal and \u201cnearly died several times.\u201d  Delirium tremens is, indeed, a disorder which must be treated promptly or else the patient is likely to die.  It\u2019s not some minor nuisance that a patient can just get over with enough willpower.  I\u2019m not surprised that Peterson ended up in a coma, because I\u2019ve treated many patients with delirium tremens severe enough over the years as to put them in a medically induced coma.  Sometimes that\u2019s necessary when the psychomotor agitation is that bad, and physiologic derangement that bad.  I\u2019m not even surprised by the description of seizures, because they also can happen in delirium tremens.  So I can\u2019t even fault the Russian doctors for doing it.  Rest assured that Peterson\u2019s health problems are his and his family\u2019s making, and not the doctors.",

On the other, the AAA methods have long shown to make products less good by their abusive methods.\n\nBut then I don't expect California to bite hard enough to actually get Blizzard/Acti to change their policies.

(who needs thinks like \"validity\", \"facts\", \"multiple years of rigorous training in non classical logics, metaphysics, epistemology, sematics, and ethics\" when \"it just makes sense right\"?)\n\nAnd yes, to do to contemporary professional philosophy you have to learn math.

Wizards have to make great strides in isolating themselves to protect themselves from muggles, who by contrast in a century have made huge and impressive innovations in technology, almost scarily so for any aged wizard. Historical reports of witches charming themselves out of burnings are not necessarily credible with all the apparent falsehoods and muggle misunderstandings present in wizard academic books and outright lies in others coupled with a general disinterest in muggle history except for people like Arthur.\n\nThis decline in turn feeds the death eater cult looking to purify wizards and go back to a mythical glorious past.

From the fantastic beasts movie we know there's wizards in New York and that they use magic to hide their government offices inside regular buildings. If they used the towers for something similar then logically they would have safeguards against attacks. If not, the magic required to stop a plane crash might expose magic to the entire world, especially since there's live news coverage on the event. Without significant wizards populations in the buildings it might not be worth violating the statute of secrecy, especially against the second plane when every news camera is pointing at the tower. Not to mention that the magic required to stop planes are probably too advanced for a regular wizard and would probably require a coordinated team.\n\nOn the other hand, if the attacks were magical in nature, then the wizard government would be in full damage control and cover up the events by changing memories of muggles and spreading propaganda by explaining how the attacks were not magical. Imagine aurors coordinating with the muggle president to secretly wage war on terror against magical terrorists.",

For the second game, only the campaign was playable.

A few events have occurred over the last few years that led to this situation. First, [the removal of most of the far right, or pro-Trump subreddits](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/08/us/politics/reddit-bans-forum-dedicated-to-supporting-trump-and-twitter-permanently-suspends-his-allies-who-spread-conspiracy-theories.html). Second, the increase in global disinformation campaigns specifically targeting American citizens. ([https://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-disinformation-campaign-aims-to-undermine-confidence-in-pfizer-other-covid-19-vaccines-u-s-officials-say-11615129200](https://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-disinformation-campaign-aims-to-undermine-confidence-in-pfizer-other-covid-19-vaccines-u-s-officials-say-11615129200), [https://www.npr.org/2020/06/16/878169027/study-exposes-russia-disinformation-campaign-that-operated-in-the-shadows-for-6-](https://www.npr.org/2020/06/16/878169027/study-exposes-russia-disinformation-campaign-that-operated-in-the-shadows-for-6-)). Suddenly, there were many right wing supporters in need of new subreddits to join, and simultaneously actors across the world were attempting to spark a new wave of disinformation.\n\nThe subreddit is now full of far right posts that skirt the line of reddit\u2019s ToS.  Many popular posts prompt vicious arguments between users, and even mods. There is a strong tension between the users that have been on the sub for many years, and those that flocked there in recent years on right-wing conspiracies like QAnon, election fraud, etc.. The long-standing subscribers constantly butt heads with the newer users, especially on the low effort posts that fill the subreddit. The users are constantly demanding that the mods remove posts that are just political tweets or propaganda, typically with no response.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the 2020 election, there was a disinformation campaign about Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop \u2013 pushed by  Rudy Giuliani ([https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/oct/20/facebook-posts/fact-checking-unproven-claims-about-hunter-biden-a/](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/oct/20/facebook-posts/fact-checking-unproven-claims-about-hunter-biden-a/)). Reddit Admins aggressively enforced their misinformation policy when it came to this issue, since it was clearly related to election interference.\n\nA mod, u/AssuredlyAThrowAway (still a moderator), posted this strange notice, and pinned it to the subreddit. The mods clearly disagree with Admin\u2019s actions regarding the Hunter Biden story, \u201cAs moderators, we have little choice but to adhere to this standard being imposed by the site admins to avoid the subreddit itself being banned.\u201d But even more egregiously, the mod actually writes the exact thing that the Admin were banning, in a tongue-in-cheek comment: \u201cWe should also note that if, as claimed, the video contains child pornography it would not be allowed to be posted on this subreddit under any circumstances to begin with.\u201d [https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/jhk7pi/reddit\\_admin\\_notice\\_to\\_all\\_communities\\_regarding/](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/jhk7pi/reddit_admin_notice_to_all_communities_regarding/) \n\nOn November 5th, Reddit sent a fairly strongly worded notice to the mods of r/conspiracy regarding false election claims. [https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/jotlhb/reddit\\_site\\_wide\\_admin\\_notice\\_regarding\\_unsourced/](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/jotlhb/reddit_site_wide_admin_notice_regarding_unsourced/) \n\nThe mods, though, were blatantly involved in pushing misinformation about the election. One, known as u/axolotyl_peyotl, was especially aggressive. On a post regarding New tGingrich claiming election fraud, the mod fought in the comments, defending the OP and saying he was \u201cbeing massively brigaded.\u201d Then writing \u201cAll you're doing is asking questions and you are being heavily downvoted for your trouble. The only reason that's happening is because the answers are very inconvenient to the narrative of the bad actors and shills.\u201d ([https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/jx42dn/newt\\_gingrich\\_when\\_i\\_learn\\_that\\_these\\_votes\\_were/gcu6q87/?context=8&depth=9](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/jx42dn/newt_gingrich_when_i_learn_that_these_votes_were/gcu6q87/?context=8&depth=9)) The moderator is devaluing any user on his sub that disagrees with him to be simply actors and shills.\n\nOn January 6th, the day of the Capitol riot,  the moderator u/axolotl_peyotl posted an obviously wildly fabricated story, and PINNED IT to the sub: \n\n>ITALYGATE: Obama and Renzi (former PM of Italy) orchestrated the theft of the U.S. election from President Trump.

A particular frustration is that the subreddit long had rules about the kinds of posts allowed. It was forbidden to post memes, misleading headlines, and generally the post had to be conspiracy related. For each post, users are required to write a Submission Statement, explaining how it\u2019s a conspiracy. But essentially the subreddit goes unmoderated.\n\nThe tension between groups of users, and sometimes mods, is clear in many posts:\n\n* There are joke posts about the Clinton\u2019s \u201cdeath count\u201d cited to actual satire websites. [https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/nzmb88/cdc\\_people\\_with\\_dirt\\_on\\_clintons\\_have\\_843\\_greater/?sort=controversial](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/nzmb88/cdc_people_with_dirt_on_clintons_have_843_greater/?sort=controversial)\n* There are posts claiming that there is missing chain of custody information for 24% of ballots, cited to a tweet. [https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/nzv2ni/1\\_in\\_4\\_ballots\\_missing\\_with\\_no\\_chain\\_of\\_custody/?sort=controversial](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/nzv2ni/1_in_4_ballots_missing_with_no_chain_of_custody/?sort=controversial) \n* Many posts include titles like, \u201cTell me more about \u2018white privilege\u2019\u201d [https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/mdbxrz/tell\\_me\\_more\\_about\\_white\\_privilege/?sort=controversial](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/mdbxrz/tell_me_more_about_white_privilege/?sort=controversial)\n\nIt is a common occurrence on posts to see users demanding for something to be removed, or asking, \u201chow is this a conspiracy?\u201d. You\u2019ll see these kinds of posts and conflicts all over the sub.\n\nI'm sure even casual redditors have noticed this switch at r/conspiracy. The ongoing conflict on this sub is especially concerning because the sub is a clear gateway for young redditors to become radicalized. Most redditors do not typically find themselves on websites advocating election fraud, anti-vaxx theories, etc., but r/conspiracy is a central location for millions of young internet users looking for something to read about.",

This person actually said, \u201cwhat does Clinton have to do with this?

Every day I truly do have to question if these \u201cpaid corporate shills\u201d that these guys think are 70% of the subreddit actually exist, because sometimes it seems likely that they really do exist - only we would probably disagree on who those people are.

            "OP, thanks for this post. I was a su subscriber about 2-3 years before trumps presidency. It was a much different climate. We talked our interference in foreign nation's elections, money in politics, uncovered conspiracies such as COINTELPRO, MK Ultra, our harboring of Nazis, and the occasional Illuminati post and ufos. You know, real conspiracies grounded in data and record keeping and the 1 or 2 \"fun\" conspiracies like ufos or Illuminati. \n\nThen FBI ANON shit started coming (Pizza Gate). Then the conspiracies take on a political slant and a \"let's just throw interpretations on the wall and see what sticks\" approach. All the people at the center of Illuminati conspiracies were rappers and pop stars. I grew out of it by this time as I was becoming a leftist. I began to care about real world issues and active conspiring of our government with wealthy people and corporations. I learned more about our history of protests and radical policies. I required more evidence than just ramblings.\n\nI came back there in the sub during trumps presidency. What a depressing sight. Every day it was \"look what athe satanic liberals are doing\". It seems that Pizza Gate and Gamergate were just trial runs for something larger. QAnon. A resurgence of McCarthyism that was a bit more decentralized. Everything was satanic, Marxist, agenda. Unfortunately  this misinformation campaign was effective on Americans. It fed into QAnon and QAnon conditioned citizens into being ripe for Then next misinformation campaign. 2 siblings of mine were taken by the madness of it all. One is a Q believer and won't take the vaccine and believes BLM was a plot. The other one became a \"libertarian\" who hates government and social welfare.\n\nAmazing what 4 years can do.",

Funny expressions have been hijacked as political tools.\n\nIt's kinda like a war of opinion being fought with frog pictures and movie posters, it's already happened on 4chan and most other posters got steam rolled. They've brought it to reddit now and the boards they primarily aim for constantly shift. Once theyve infiltrated the mods its only a matter of time before they accidently let one post stay up and reddit brings down the ban hammer.\n\nFacebook has been absolutely decimated by it since it offers light moderation in comparison to other places. Entire groups, posts, pages, profiles have been created for the sole purpose of political propaganda. Friend groups are infiltrated by using Facebook automatic algorithms to find people you may know.

The common thread in all of these things - to extend military force over a foreign power and bring it under American Imperialism. Conservatives are under little risk of state conspiracy; they agree with most of the things the US uses actually conspiracy to accomplish.

        "selftext": "**Context**. The Bachelor, famed ABC reality TV series where one man dates a plethora of women until he narrows down one to propose to, is currently in its 25th season with a few weeks left. This season features our first black Bachelor Matt James, who was announced as the lead in response to the summer BLM protests and related accusations of the franchise being racist (which it totally is). The choice of lead was slightly controversial--not only had Matt James never made an appearance in the franchise before, many were not enthused that he was a [registered Republican](https://imgur.com/a/NeTwGX0) or [the world's worst roommate](https://np.reddit.com/r/thebachelor/comments/l1eig9/podcast_recap_with_matts_old_roommate_about/).\n\nMatt James's picker also came into question when viewers saw that he connected strongly with contestant Rachael Kirkconnell, and /r/thebachelor denizens were quick to notice all sorts of odd things about her past. These small rumblings slowly grew in intensity over time, and exploded into the subreddit's consciousness when a series of [very popular Tiktoks](https://www.tiktok.com/@feministmama/video/6922205182235249926?source=h5_m&is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1) surfaced about Rachael's problematic behavior, including dressing up as a Native American and bullying a high school classmate for liking black guys. While the subreddit was quick to denounce her, the Rachael situation was pretty unknown in the general Bachelor-viewing population until a Reddit user unearthed [photos of Rachael at an Old South antebellum party.](https://np.reddit.com/r/thebachelor/comments/lcr714/in_2018_rachael_attended_the_kappa_alpha_order/) Suddenly, the issue became too big for the franchise to ignore, as the prospect of the show's first black bachelor ending up with a Southern racist was just too controversial.\n\nUnfortunately, the franchise failed to really address it properly. Host Chris Harrison, in [an interview with former Bachelorette Rachel Lindsay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hmY1gSAuRk), managed to dig himself into a hole and bury himself in it when he both (badly) defended Kirkconnell and was incredibly condescending toward Lindsay, a black woman. This was definitely a bad look and resulted [in quite a bit of backlash](https://np.reddit.com/r/thebachelor/comments/lh4s23/the_moderators_of_rthebachelor_denounce_chris/), causing Harrison to [step aside from the franchise](https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/13/entertainment/chris-harrison-the-bachelor-interview-trnd/index.html) and Lindsay to delete her social media accounts as a result of harassment from angry white moms.\n\n**Taylor Nolan**. Taylor Nolan is a 27-year-old 2016 Bachelor alum and a participant on Season 4 of Bachelor in Paradise, where former contestants get drunk on a beach for 2 weeks and then get engaged at the end. She is a trained therapist, and is pretty famous amongst the fandom for her [criticism of racist contestants](https://www.reddit.com/r/thebachelor/comments/gmbgu3/taylor_nolan_weighs_in_on_the_hannah_b_situation/) and for her podcast Let's Talk About It, where she gets candid about race, sex, and mental health. Before about 2 days ago, /r/thebachelor generally viewed Nolan positively: she was [a friend to Lindsay and other Bachelor race activists](https://www.reddit.com/r/thebachelor/comments/ls8ckz/i_thought_this_exchange_between_taylor_nolan_and/) and her only crimes were [being really annoying about her sex life](https://www.reddit.com/r/thebachelor/comments/j5t6d3/bachelors_taylor_nolan_is_in_a_nonmonogamous/) and [trying to solicit money on Venmo for educating white people](https://np.reddit.com/r/thebachelor/comments/gtxjeg/taylor_sharing_her_venmopaypal_for_educating/), though these could be overlooked when she was considered a crucial ally to BIPOC in the franchise. She lead the charge in [calling for Harrison's removal](https://twitter.com/taymocha/status/1364047002909044742), denouncing Kirkconnell, and in supporting Lindsay.\n\nThat all turned on its head when a user, justifiably banned from the main Bachelor subreddit for trying to take down Rachel Lindsay, went digging and found a plethora of [insanely offensive tweets](https://www.reddit.com/r/BachelorNation/comments/lumk03/taylor_nolan_disgusting_hypocrite/) from Nolan. Turns out, Nolan did a really bad job of hiding her bigotry, and soon /r/thebachelor was flooded with a large variety of offensive Nolan tweets and Facebook posts from 2010-2014, where she manages to somehow offend nearly every demographic--with posts that range from virulently racist against Asians to generally hateful to dogs and everywhere in between. Even worse, she is a licensed therapist and has tweets suggesting that people with mental disorders kill themselves, along with posts shaming rape victims and mocking her clients. You can find a summary of them [here.](https://np.reddit.com/r/thebachelor/comments/lve4se/taylor_nolan_megathread_part_2/) The previous link also contains directions to Nolan's numerous \"apologies,\" including a rambling 30+ minute Instagram video where, among other things, she justifies her racist posts against Indian men, fails to apologize to people other than BIPOC who were hurt (and there's a lot of demographics she pissed 0ff), and generally fails to take any accountability. Of course, this is extra ironic for somebody who was well-known for calling out racist Bachelor Nation members for their [half-hearted apologies](https://twitter.com/taymocha/status/1361515294636732418?lang=en).\n\n**The Subreddit drama**. The entire front page of /r/thebachelor right now is a dumpster fire and it's pretty easy to find drama wherever you go. Most people are condemning Nolan, but some users are concerned about bad-faith actors using Nolan's behavior to lessen the impact of Harrison's and Kirkconnells (and consequently defending Nolan?!), leading to all sorts of fun and sad confrontations that I've picked out for you here.\n\n[Main megathread containing all of Nolan's tweets and \"apologies.\"](https://np.reddit.com/r/thebachelor/comments/lve4se/taylor_nolan_megathread_part_2/)\n\n[Did The Bachelor Franchise leak Nolan's old tweets to get back at Chris Harrison's firing?](https://np.reddit.com/r/thebachelor/comments/lv6tzn/do_you_think_tptb_are_the_ones_who_leaked_taylors/)\n\n[\"Okay, this is a witch hunt\"](https://np.reddit.com/r/thebachelor/comments/lv3f4v/many_of_taylors_tweets_are_from_2013_while_she/gpaupfo?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n[\"Why not the energy for Kirkconnell?\"](https://np.reddit.com/r/thebachelor/comments/lv3f4v/many_of_taylors_tweets_are_from_2013_while_she/gpat9sw?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n\"[now they\u2019re trying to dismantle another Black woman who is dedicating to holding the Bachelor to a higher standard just like she does for herself.](https://np.reddit.com/r/thebachelor/comments/luwlkb/taylor_nolans_tweets/)\"\n\n[Just for fun: Has Taylor Nolan insulted you?

Female employee's of the index equals about 35 employees, of which 67% alleged harassment, so that makes roughly 24 female persons harassed from the index. The remainder of the index is 98 employee's at a rate of 33%, so roughly 33 male persons harassed from the index. That means 1.375 men are harassed for every woman that is harassed, NOT a 2:1 ratio.\n\nWell this is absolutely idiotic and bad math, bad statistics, and bad science. Let me demonstrate:\n\n* Approximately 6 million jews died in the holocaust\n* About 7-8 million Germans died during WW2\n* This means about 1.2 Germans died for every jew\n* Conclusion; It was safer to be a jew than it was to be a german in nazi Germany\n\nThis is insane because jews did die at higher rates than Germans. Around 8% of Germans died, and about 55% of jews in German occupied territory were killed. The problem is that there were a lot more Germans than Jews. So even though Jews were treated like shit and indiscriminately murdered, a higher total number of Germans died. But it was by far much much nicer to be German in nazi Germany, than to be a jew in nazi Germany.",

A lot of people called him out for it, but at the same time a lot of people defended him because he was \u201cjust doing it for fun\u201d. Last night night xqc decided to take the sponsor and streamed it to 150k+ people with the website name in his title and his own referral code.

He is now receiving backlash even from his biggest fans.\n\nSome of the top comments \n\n[He said yesterday that he\u2019d never do a sponsored gambling stream.

            ">most people just exile them even more and increasing there problem instead of giveing him a short explanation of how to do it right.\n\nWay to lower our expectations of awkward men to the center of the earth. Guys, you should be insulted by how stupid this jabroni thinks you are. Let's be real here. If you can use technology competently enough to send someone a dick pic on Reddit, you should also be smart enough to figure out the basic rules of interacting with other people, such as icebreakers are generally short greetings or jokes, not flashing your genitals. If you've somehow missed the very basics of being human among other humans, your use of Reddit should indicate that you're tech-savvy enough to Google something like \"it is weird to show a stranger a picture of my dick?\"\n\nLet's raise the bar for men at least to the little divide between the mantle and the core of the planet. I know y'all have functioning brains located in your head, not your pants, despite how much the worst among you insist you don't.\n\nWhile we're at it, let's lower the bar for everyone else. Look, if I showed up in a public place and introduced myself, you should know not to show me your dick. It's only polite. Just introduce yourself and make small talk about the weather. Maybe tell me a stupid pun. Nobody should have to tell you this other than your parents, let alone a complete stranger. I can't even put this on other dudes to police you, because not showing your dick to strangers should be up there with basics like how to hold a fork or wipe your own ass.\n\nHey, and be honest with yourself. You know you're thirsty and desperate for attention. By your own admission, you cock-flashers and unsolicited dick-pic-ers lack the very, very, very basics of human interaction. So, let's say I'm nice, even though I shouldn't be obligated to be after you show me your dick, and tell you that you're not doing the whole introducing yourself thing right.\n\nYou know if you're one of these dudes you're not going to interpret me being nice the right way. You're going to go \"oh god, she's talking to me, she must want to be my wifu\" and you're going to solicit more conversation from me. After showing me your dick after I didn't ask for it, I don't particularly want to be your friend. But you're over there, thinking that because I gave you six seconds to send back \"maybe say hi before whipping it out\" that we're going to get married. So when I cut off conversation entirely when you escalate the weirdness (because you will), then I'm a terrible bitch and I broke your heart. Or I'm a terrible bitch for correcting you in the first place.\n\nBut hey, maybe you're the one in a million guy who's dumb enough to send an unsolicited dick pic but somehow smart enough to pick up cues that I'm just kindly correcting your dick-pic-sending course and not contact me again. I'm not saying it's impossible, I'm saying that it's very improbable and I have *literally never* found one of these magical unicorns of dudes who are simultaneously too dumb to function and also smart enough to immediately back up with the creepies at the first sign that the advances are unwanted.\n\nSo, yeah: introduce yourself without your dick and none of this would be an issue. Nobody needs to tell you that, just like nobody needs to tell you that you put your pants on your legs, not your head.",

If you can find like 10 women online per day to send your member to, then that means you get a positive response every 100 days. That's sex more than 3 times per year. \n\nIt's way more complicated than this, but basically I'm wondering if unsolicited dick pics are like spam in that they hardly ever work and \"no one\" likes them, but actually it's economical for people to send them because the payoff is higher than the cost. \n\nMaybe I need to /r/AskReddit for stories about their positive responses to dick pics?

To put it simply, the entire point of raising awareness towards a cause is not only to get people's attention, but also to make them very uncomfortable and upset enough to do something about it.\n\nThe very act of making people upset and uncomfortable also makes them upset and uncomfortable at the actual act itself (and thus by extension the person doing the act; literally every figurehead from Nelson Mandela to Martin Luther King Jr. to Mahatma Gandhi were very very unpopular at the time!), but if you're effective eventually you're able to agitate people into either actually acknowledging your point if not agreeing and flocking to your banner, or as more often than not simply deciding that it's worth placating you simply to make you go away (or, as also more often than not, silencing you permanently).\n\nWhat's worse is I don't even have a particularly strong opinion about the actual random Swedish teenager that likes sail boating, but know your political history people!",

            "Hi, Swede with opinions here.\n\nI appreciate the need to do something to help the environment, however, seeing as Greta is the daughter of two pretty wealthy people (an actor and an opera singer, ffs) it's very easy for her to tell people what to do. Many people are not able to take a zero-emission boat when they want to travel somewhere because they have regular jobs and thus, a limited amount of time and money. Meanwhile, her parents have money and seem to be okay with her not going to school, it seems - so she has both.\n\nAs far as I've seen she isn't causing actual change: for example, the Swedish right wing party Moderaterna announced today that their shadow budget includes lower taxes on petrol/gasoline and diesel in order to supposedly alleviate costs for people who don't live in major cities. Meanwhile, the current railway infrastructure in Sweden is in great need of repairs, updates and expansions (this applies to buses as well), not to mention that the costs of travel with public transport often are greater than the costs of travel by private car (depending on the destination, of course). All of this plays a part in discouraging people from taking the train or the bus.\n\nShe's absolutely right in that many of the previous generations are using up natural resources and don't actually care enough about the environment to do anything about it: a Swedish poll (Novus for SVT) published today shows that more than 50% of 18 to 29-year olds decreased the amount of meat they eat or eliminated it completely from their diets. Only a third of the age group 50-79 has decreased how much meat they consume. Greta will not make a difference because the people which need to pay attention to and listen to her (e.g. Bolsonaro who's 64 years old, Trump who's 74 years old) in order for that to happen, will not.\nMany young people already know what she is taking about, or are, at least, already listening, but do we have 20 years to wait around until they are old enough to create policy?\n\nDon't get me started on her encouraging school strikes when there are measles outbreaks, people who think the planet is flat and people don't know how their own species reproduces.\n\nBasically, more education is needed, not less, and for people born before 1990, not after.\n...That's what I think, anyway.",
            "The accusation of her being \"groomed\" for her role in the protests is just kinda sad to me. I know a few people personally who hold this view despite being in complete agreement with her actual message. It's just that they are too cynical about the world to even consider someone like her to be genuine.\n\nPeople being self-serving narcissists is apparently the norm to them. To a certain degree I can understand where this cynism is coming from but it's still a pretty sad view on humanity as a whole.",
            "Sorry Greta. This is the United States of America. We have chosen to vehemently deny and ignore any potentially catastrophic environmental issues. I mean, Corporations need to make money! Petrochemicals and industrial wastewater are the very BLOOD of America! We only have so much time until those red states realize the coal jobs aren't really coming back, so now is not the time to act! Fighting climate change would require new industries that might not be able to fund GOP superpacs like Oil and Gas can. And I mean, really, new industry would mean more education and for the love of christ we can't have that. I mean, America's very face is the coal-streaked visage of a young miner who's desperately trying to keep his family in opiates and Mountain Dew.  Or a combat veteran with severe PTSD living on the street like the resourceful pioneer that is our country's stock and trade. We cannot, under any circumstances, allow these Patriots be replaced by a well-groomed smirking man in a Prius. He could be a gay, he could be a vegetarian. He might not even be a Christian. For the love of god, they might even put a non-white up there on some billboard. Right there, smack dab in the middle of God's own America, some asshole named Jason or Phil or something. Up on that billboard telling us that we was wrong! This whole time we was wrong and it was godless Europeans who were right.

People are generally stubborn by nature, it's a trait of humanity as a whole, so the message itself gets lost in her own self promotion and talking down to people, especially from a 16 year old who knows nothing of adult daily life. Whether you like her message or not, she's doing far more harm than good to the very cause she's beating her drum for.\n\nAdded to this, there's the issues of scientists getting climate change wrong in the past. There was a lot of flip flopping dating from the early 80's until now that I have personally seen, so people are of the mindset of \"Hang on, we've heard this before\". It might be a sad reality, but it's reality nonetheless and it's a lesson that never seems to be learned by many, myself included, until much later in life. To change the mind you must first change the heart, and a 16 year old isn't capable of that for many. People are fed up being told what to do day in and day out. As far as science goes, many feel everything is bad for us because they told us so, so by extension we may as well just enjoy what we have because we won't be around to enjoy it. This might not be a popular opinion, but it's the most logical way of looking at it when you take emotion out of the equation."

A report published by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights stated that although the \"pervasive and devastating economic and social crisis began before the imposition of the first economic sanctions\", the new sanctions could worsen the situation.[5][6] In April 2019, Human Rights Watch and Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health published a joint report noting that most early sanctions did not target the Venezuelan economy in any way,[7] adding that sanctions imposed in 2019 could worsen the situation, but that \"the crisis precedes them\".[7]\n\n[\u2013]from PinguinGirl03 via /r/TheRightCantMeme \n\n>Because your premise is demonstrably false, can I get unbanned?\n\n[\u2013]subreddit message via /r/TheRightCantMeme\n\n>Stop trying to use Wikipedia as a source here. Venezuela's only fault was not diversifying its economy enough so that when other oil dependent nations like Saudi Arabia (backed by the US) lower oil prices, it directly affects Venezuelan economy. The crisis was very much multiplied by the sanctions and even if Venezuela was trying to overcome its problems itself, what right does the US have to target its citizens through sanctions? [1]\n\n[\u2013]to /r/TheRightCantMeme \n\n>I do not think the sanctions are a good thing in the first place. But that completely ignores the fact that Venezuela has experienced massive civil unrest and rampant inflation since at least 2014.\n\n>Also I am not sure why you want to defend Venezuela as a left wing country when they have higher income inequality than even the US. They also score 4th place in the perceived corruption index and a 2.76 on the Economist democracy index.\n\nYou have been temporarily muted from r/TheRightCantMeme.

Before you could say \"Christian Dior's website had erased all mention of his name\", Christian Dior's website had erased all mention of his name.\n\nHe actually tried to sue the couple for defaming him, even though there was video footage of the incident. He came across as a massive \"don't you know who I am\" bellend. Also he modelled his personal look on Jack Sparrow, but he was in his fifties so he just looked like a tosser.\n\nInevitably he was given a slap on the wrist, made to sit on the bench for a couple of years, and has re-ingratiated himself with the fashion elite. I have the impression that this Notch fellow won't be able to do the same because he lives in a bubble, whereas with Galliano I have the impression he needed the money. A similar thing happened to Mel Gibson, although his comeback hasn't really stuck.\n\nNotch reminds me a bit of Eric Raymond, the open source chap, who began as a kind of ingratiating hanger-on and turned into a similarly creepy lunatic, but because computer nerds live in a bubble they just become more extreme. Obviously when I say \"computer nerds\" I don't mean *you*. I mean *them*. You're a regular guy. I respect you. You aren't trying to mask a deep inadequacy in your life by hiding behind computers.\n\nThe argument is that people in the fashion industry are highly stressed because they're one bad collection away from irrelevance, and the success criteria are arbitrary, so they're blundering in a darkened room full of traps, but I never heard about Alexander McQueen or Jean-Paul Gaultier screaming anti-semitic abuse at people. Karl Lagerfield was abrasive but there was a certain level of self-awareness when he insulted people.\n\nI wonder if this is why Apple has moved away from the notch design for their mobile phones. They don't want people to associate the iPhone with antisemitism. Also, did you know that there were bicycle soldiers in the two world wars? They were given bicycles to get around. They didn't charge the enemy on bicycles - they dismounted first - but there's something absurd about the idea.",

Studies vary but many have found the majority of people who sexually offend against children are actually not pedophiles. \n\n\nIt may seem counterintuitive but it is actually safer for children if the public comes to realize this. If we create a narrative that pedophiles can\u2019t be treated and will eventually offend, then a sort of fatalism manifests and more people with PD will go on to harm children. If we instead say that pedophilia is not a choice but sexually offending IS then they are more likely to seek treatment. The stigma this association creates is also harmful for two reasons. 1. No ones wants to come out as having PD so they don\u2019t receive treatment which leads to higher rates of offending. 2. Almost all studies have been done on offending pedophiles because they are the only ones we can identify. This means we don\u2019t know what protective factors prevent pedophilia or offending due to pedophilia. Because of that we don\u2019t know how to best treat it and thus reduce the harm done to children. \n\n\nOf course none of that says that pedophilia is good (otherwise it wouldn\u2019t be in the DSM/ICD) or that child sexual abuse should be more acceptable.",

All I'll say is that there is nothing, absolutely nothing, that George Floyd did that warrants him being slowly choked to death over 8 minutes by Derek Chauvin.\n\nIt doesn't matter if he is high on drugs.\n\nIt doesn't matter if he's been to prison before.\n\nIt doesn't matter if he actually did use a counterfeit bill (even though he didn't).\n\nIt doesn't matter if he had a pre-existing heart condition.\n\nIt doesn't matter if he was hyperventilating and having a panic attack in the car itself.\n\nIt doesn't matter if he had any other mental illness.\n\nIt doesn't matter if he wasn't following orders and doing what he was told.\n\nIt doesn't matter if he was resisting arrest.\n\nIt doesn't matter. \n\nNone of these things matter. \n\nBecause none of these things are a death sentence. And they shouldn't be a death sentence. None of these things are crimes of a magnitude so high that you have to pay for it with your life. None of these things are so awful, so terrible, so disgustingly egregious, that George Floyd deserved to die. \n\nIt doesn't matter if all of these things were true at the same time. He didn't deserve to die. He didn't deserve to be murdered by a police officer, a person who is implicitly trusted by society to have the awareness and discernment of the law, to know that they do not have the power to punish people with death for doing these things.\n\nThere are people who do these things every day, who are not murdered. There are people who do worse, who murder millions with their words, policies, and actions, who have wrought death and destruction upon humanity out of nothing but greed and misery, who are allowed to walk free and escape consequences. Who get to keep their life and their money and their name, who get people who make excuses for them and their reputation. Who get professional apologetics splashed over fancy op-eds and editorials. \n\nBut it's George Floyd, an unremarkable, nameless, faceless man, without the money or the wealth or the political connections to make excuses for him, who \"deserves\" to get murdered, all because he had the misfortune of being at the wrong convenience store on the wrong day, after having lived a life that people, with a few casual strokes of their keyboard, have dismissingly assessed as inherently worthless. \n\nAll because he might have been on drugs. Because he might have been high. Because he didn't do what the police officer told him to do. So he deserved to die. Because our society thinks that mass-murderers deserve enough grace to be kept alive and treated well by police officers, but doesn't think a black man deserves the same courtesy.\n\nAnd to all the people who agreed with the comments on that subreddit, just know that thinking this way won't protect you from the police, should you ever have the misfortune of being in that position.",

A man clearly in distress being blamed for having a panic attack after being run up on by officers, and they're blaming him for panicking. *If you just act inhumanely calm then you won't be murdered, that simple.*\n\nAlso, just going to leave this here for those claiming it was drugs that killed him:\n\n>it\u2019s an exaggeration of toxicology results to claim Floyd \u201cwas high on meth\u201d when he was choked by a cop, and there\u2019s no proof that Floyd was \u201cgetting ready to drive a car\u201d before his fatal encounter with police other than the fact that officers say they approached him as he sat in the driver\u2019s seat of a vehicle.\n\n\n>Two days later, the county released a\u00a0statement\u00a0that attributed Floyd\u2019s cause of death to \u201ccardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0which essentially means he died because his heart and lungs stopped while he was being restrained by police.\n\n>>According to the county\u2019s postmortem\u00a0toxicology screening, which is summarized below and was performed one day after Floyd\u2019s death, he was intoxicated with fentanyl and had recently used methamphetamines (as well as other substances) before Chauvin choked him. More Specifically, Floyd tested positive for 11 ng/mL of fentanyl \u2014 which is a synthetic opioid pain reliever \u2014 and 19 ng/mL of methamphetamine, or meth, though it\u2019s unclear by what method the intoxicants got into his bloodstream or for what reasons.\n\n>>But more complex is proving whether \u201che was high\u201d at the time of his fatal encounter with police. While everyone\u2019s reaction to and tolerance for such drugs varies, and the effects of mixing drugs can be totally unpredictable, lab technicians say fentanyl slowly leaves users\u2019 systems, mostly via urination, over the course of three days from when they first shot up. Additionally, they consider \u201cthe presence of fentanyl above 0.20 ng/mL\u201d \u2014 which is significantly less than the amount found in Floyd\u2019s system \u2014 to be \u201ca strong indicator that the patient has used fentanyl,\u201d according to\u00a0Mayo Clinic Laboratories.\u00a0\n\n>>>For\u00a0methamphetamines, which are typically smoked or injected, users feel an instant euphoria, and then the tapering effects of the drug last anywhere from eight to 24 hours. After that initial \u201crush,\u201d the amount of meth reduces in their bloodstreams and tests for the drug can be positive for up to five days. Per the\u00a0University of Rochester Medical Center, the amount of methamphetamines found in Floyd\u2019s bloodstream (19 ng/mL or .019 mg/L) is \u201cwithin the range\u201d of some patients\u2019 \u201ctherapeutic or prescribed use\u201d of the drug.\n\n>>>Also, Hennepin County medical examiners stated Floyd\u2019s blood levels made it seem like he had \u201crecently\u201d used meth in the past, not that he was peaking on a high from it, and the county investigators did not list the drugs as Floyd\u2019s cause of death, but rather as \u201csignificant conditions\u201d that influenced how he died.\u00a0For those reasons and considering the amount of methamphetamines detected in Floyd\u2019s toxicology report, it\u2019s an exaggeration of the scientific evidence to claim Floyd \u201cwas high on meth\u201d before police choked him \u2014 though his bloodstream did test positive for the drug.\n\nSo no, he was not high on drugs and drugs did not kill him, the police officers kneeing his neck killed him. \"Oh but still it was easier to kill him because of his condition.\" Doesn't matter, still murder. And I'll just leave this here:\n\n*But while making that analysis, it is important to consider the insight of a group of emergency room doctors and psychiatrists, who in the wake of Floyd\u2019s death wrote in the\u00a0Scientific American: \u201cWhen Black people are killed by police, their character and even their\u00a0anatomy\u00a0is turned into justification for their killer\u2019s exoneration.

If you have a word that describes you in front of American you have been a victim of racism in america\n\n>I agree man, I\u2019m white. My girlfriend is Asian and what she goes through is honestly horrific. I got pulled over a few weeks ago and the cop used a slur to describe my giftfriend to dispatch over the radio, who was sitting in the passenger seat.\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/m6n34n/7_dead_in_shootings_at_three_spas_in_metro_atlanta/gr6vfm7/\n\n>Being Asian American right now...feels bad man\n\n>Or blaming black people for the anti Asian racism. It\u2019s like no no no, black people weren\u2019t the ones who started calling it the China virus like a certain someone in the White House did.\n\n>And then you get people in this thread telling us it's not real and it's not happening.\n\n>Oh man, tell me about it. Whenever you try to speak up about anti-asian racism people will blatantly gaslight you like it doesn't exist. Why do people do this?\n\n>Probably because they subconsciously remember all the times they were outright racist to Asian people.\n\n>Our issues as minorities are secondary. Immigrants from well developed nations are going to fair better than the global south countries. However, we're all asians so we're all the same I guess. Growing up I've spent a lot of time diminishing my accomplishments since I viewed them from an obvious perspective of someone who grew up in the US. My white peers didn't have to translate for their parents at age 7 and 8. They didn't have to be involved with the finances.\n\n>See, when people hear \"white privilege\" they often get defensive saying things like \"white people can be poor too\" or something similar. To me, the greatest privilege that hardly crosses most people's minds is the mental freedom of being able to travel and live anywhere in your own country without fearing of being the target of some kind of hate or ignorance--whether it be someone whispering a racial slur behind your back or straight up violence, or even something as innocent as the question we get too often, \"no, where are you really from?\" Maybe my fears are overblown, but even before the rise of these hate crimes I've never felt like I could see the USA by myself without having to deal with that shit. It sucks feeling like an outsider in your own home.\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/m6n34n/7_dead_in_shootings_at_three_spas_in_metro_atlanta/gr76ovk/\n\n>These type of spots are everywhere.

It's the BLACKS!\" any time the attacker is a POC, and then doubling back and saying \"no no no! there was no racist intent!\" when the attacker is white. Now incels are jumping through hoops trying to justify these womens deaths by assuming they were all sex workers, as if that somehow made them less \"valuable\" as human fucking beings.\n\nHow about we stop playing tug of war with asian lives? We are not pawns to advance your fucked up ideologies. Growing up asian american, I always felt like asian racism was a thing, but that it was never so bad that I had the \"right\" to complain, or maybe I just didn't have the balls.\n\nWhite supremacists love to pull us close, the model minority, and whisper into our ears \"no, see? we *love* you, we're not racists\" so that we can pretend we're not constantly objectified, stereotyped, and dehumanised. So that we can cling to this toxic faux-whiteness that only divides minorities and elevates white power.\n\nWe're in a blind spot now where we are dying, hate crimes are rising, and nobody cares. Because no body ever cared about asians. Before, it was okay to call us \"yellow boy\", and \"chink\" and \"gook\" and wrinkle your nose at us and ask if we're \"eating dog\". And now it's okay to look the other way when we are killed, because our status as \"them\", as the props of racist america, has not changed.\n\nI wish I had the strength to do something.

I come from a republican family and when trump was running I thought for sure I would\u2019ve voted for him (I was 17).

            "I am a proud progressive and this debate is one I end up having seemingly every day. I truly believe we can amend the current system and shift it towards socialist values, which gets me branded a communist by libs and conservatives and a dirty reformist by people who are further left than me. \n\nThe way I see it, EVERY politician should be criticized. As our representatives in government, they should act according to our wishes. I criticize republicans, I criticize biden, and I even criticize bernie and aoc. Mindless commitment to specific politicians freaks me out.\n\nNow, progressives refusing to vote Democrat has been a huge issue in the past, especially in 2016, but work by excellent progressive leaders and activists this election cycle led to an excellent progressive voter turnout.\n\nSo yes, we will criticize Joe Biden when we disagree with him, we will criticize republicans when we disagree with them, and we will criticize each other. That is our job as citizens, regardless of political orientation. Our politicians are supposed to represent us, and it\u2019s our job to make sure they know how we feel.\n\nEDIT: after scrolling through the responses to my comment about how we shouldn\u2019t be afraid to criticize politicians regardless of political affiliation, it appears that people have decided to respond either by complaining about the word socialism without knowing what it means or by arguing about the differences between socialism and social democracy. \n\nTo address both points, socialism is an economic system where workers own the means of production. This is a little different than progressive policies like Medicare for all and universal housing, but after decades of McCarthyism Americans have been taught by default that anything that sounds slightly socialist is bad. Right now it is clear that America is in a horrible position, we can look at the huge lines outside food banks and the sky high unemployment rate as signs that people need help and that the current system isn\u2019t working. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to love socialism, just please get outside of your echo chamber and learn about other perspectives. If you\u2019re a leftie watch some Ben Shapiro or tucker Carlson, and if you\u2019re a righty pick up Chomsky or actually try to understand Marx. Ultimately we should all want to make the world, and our countries, a better place, and the best way to do so is by working together. \n\nExcept with nazis. Fuck nazis.",

            "I get being disappointed you didn't get everything you wanted but to say his cabinet choices aren't more progressive than Obama's is absurd. The deal was Biden would bring progressives in, not that he would *become* progressive. It always seems like some of these more edgy leftist types simply refuse to believe that moderate voters actually exist and should have their voices represented as well. Biden was not elected only by progressives, he was also elected by moderates. He owes his victory to both sides, so why on earth would progressives think he would shut out the moderates?\n\nBottom line is Biden's presidency was always going to be a tug of war between progressives and moderates, because that is a reflection of the Democratic electorate. We progressives love to tell ourselves it's our time but the numbers tell us we're still sharing the country with moderates, and we can't just pretend they don't exist. We didn't back Biden because he would meet our demands, we backed him so we would have the opportunity to influence the presidency. That means a lot of work on our part, and a lot of concessions. That is going to be true in every single Democratic election until the baby boomers are gone.\n\nI'm frankly just fed up with the edginess and the refusal to acknowledge when an imperfect ally is helping you because they aren't handing you complete and total control. At least AOC had some positive things to say along with her criticisms. Progressivism is winning out, more and more every year, there's no need to be so god damn vicious and ugly when you're winning the long game.\n\nEdit: Just to clarify, I'm not saying we shouldn't be holding Biden's feet to the fire, I'm saying we should be doing that but *at the same time* giving credit **where it's due**.  Because when all you do is complain about what you didn't get, that lowers the incentive to negotiate with you at all. Giving Biden shit for not turning into Bernie Sanders is ridiculous. No matter how much we disagree with them, and no matter how much ethics and morality are on our side, moderates have the right to be heard by their elected officials too. All I want is for progressives to come to the table and acknowledge good-faith negotiating instead of naming every last single person that doesn't surrender their position to Sanders and AoC as some evil bastard that deserves to be burned at the stake.",

The best case scenario you can possibly argue in favour of Trump here is that he made a mistake and was misinformed about who was there.

I'm an adopted person with FASD. \n\nI have 4 siblings who were also adopted, and 4 more who are biologically related to my my parents. That's 9 children. Most of who are adopted have some sort of developmental or physical issue as a result of substances used in utero/abuse/neglect. \n\nIf my parents had not adopted at least 2 of my siblings, they would have been sent to a group home for the rest of their lives with no family of their own. This was the last stop for them. \n\nIs my family chaotic? Yes. Does my family have some dysfunction? Yes. Is it hard being in my family? Yeah, sometimes it is. But I wouldn't ever fucking change it. I know where me and my siblings would be if we hadn't been adopted, and the reality of that is not pretty. It would probably consist of being written off and sent to a group home because no foster home is willing to deal with our defiant and angry behavior as a result of our trauma. Or maybe being shunted off to different foster homes every 6 months or so until we turned 18. Or maybe our birth parents would have acted like they had it together for a year or so and gotten custody back, only to backslide back into neglecting/abusing us again.\n\nAll those ignorant ass people, social workers even, in those comments saying how irresponsible that mom was are disgusting to me. They truly have no idea what it is really like to be in that kind of situation, and how amazing it is to have a mom or to BE that mom who is willing to devote herself to giving you a better life.",

So she adopted 2, then she got the chance to adopt 2 more, and then DHS came to her with another 2, and their biological mother was pregnant with a third, and after being born they were able to adopt the new born as well. She ended up adopting 7 kids over a 3-4 year timeframe, she just felt like it was right. I\u2019m from the south and grew up Christian, but they were very into Church and God, and they just felt like that\u2019s what he wanted for my aunt and uncle. Not to mention all 7 children ended up coming from troubled homes where the parents of all 7 had very bad drug issues. \n\nGuess what? After 7 years of those 7 children being adopted, she ended up pregnant and was able to have her own first biological child. He is now 9-10 years old today, and healthy as a bee. 5 of those kids are now over 18 years old, and have moved out. 2 are in the marines, one is in their junior year of college, one has a child with his wife and live in a different state.\n\nOne of the 7 adopted, the 6th youngest, is a senior this coming year and has several Division 1 offers for football. \n\nThe people who commented on the original video that said those hateful comments are ignorant. They don\u2019t understand some people just have the love and drive to help and change others lives who are born into unfortunate circumstances.

            "Fun fact: Alpha males do not exist. In humans, in wolves, in the wild, they do not exist. The term was coined when a researcher was observing a group captive male adolescent wolves with no familal bond to each other. With no parental figures, no socialization, and no way to escape from eachother, they fought until there was one wolf that came out on top.\n\nAs behavioral research progressed, scientists found that the alpha structure they initially observed did not exist naturally. Wolves normally create family groups and organize themselves based on the familial structure. It turned out that the 'Alpha' was just really the most violent and rapey unsocialized adolescent wolf of the group they initially observed. A group that, again, in the wild would not exist because the other wolves would have just left the belligerent to die while they splintered off to make their own groups. BEING SOCIALBLE AND WORKING TOGETHER IS MORE IMPORTANT TO SURVIVAL THAN BEING IN CONTROL. But because they were captive, the other wolves had no choice but to become part of the belligerents group.\n\n The scientist who initially did the research has since denounced their findings and has requested that the publisher of the initial work stop making copies, but the publisher keeps pumping out the book for $$$.\n\nSo if anyone ever tells you they are alpha, the are just telling you they are literally a violent, rapey,immature asshole.

The insane burden placed on men in these ideas, seeing them as inhuman cogs in a machine, to me this seems like hating all humans, not just hating women. \n\nDo they see this irony? That if men dont reach this imagined pinnacle they have no worth? This idea of worth, that humans are commodities, goods to be invested in, it is seeing them as not thinking and feeling creatures but machines instead. \n\nI dunno, maybe people like this just wanna feel like they are inherently victimized, so when things dont go how they hope, they can blame a strawman.

The person he was replying to then released the screenshots of the DMs and started yet another pile-on, claiming Dream is a racist for being a white man who says his community isn't anti-black.*\n\n*Pile-on reached critical mass and eventually both Dream stans and Dream haters joined in to spread hate against Dream, including via faking screenshots and bringin up past, resolved controversies.*\n\n*Along the way, people, including possibly Dream's family, are getting doxxed.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2nd post done\n\n1 remains.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHello again r/LivestreamFail\n\n# [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/nw4m7m/dream_being_canceled_by_members_of_his_fan_base/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n[CONTROVERSIAL](https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/nw4m7m/dream_being_canceled_by_members_of_his_fan_base/?sort=controversial)\n\n# [I](https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/nw4m7m/dream_being_canceled_by_members_of_his_fan_base/h17f3gg?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n*Omg, shut the fuck uuuuuup.

He decided to hold a charity streaming event to raise money for Mermaids, a British charity that provides counseling to children with gender dysphoria, after Graham Linehan (creator of sitcoms The IT Crowd and Father Ted) organized an online brigade to have government funding withheld from the charity. Hbomberguy chose to stream himself playing to completion Donkey Kong 64, a game notorious for having absurd amounts of collectibles and side activities. During the stream, he had several notable guests on, including activist Chelsea Manning, Doom creator John Romero, Fallout: New Vegas director Josh Sawyer, and even Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. After 57 hours, he raised a total of just over $340,000.  \n\nNow, for the drama:  \n\n----  \n\nThread: [\"[socjus] Streamer Hbomberguy Raises Over $230,000 for Trans Charity to spite Graham Linehan\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/ai64xo/socjus_streamer_hbomberguy_raises_over_230000_for/) (thread brigaded by /r/ChapoTrapHouse)  \n\n[\"Nevermind the charity in question seems to push for prepubescent children to transition.  \nThink of the homeless or poor charities that would like this money.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/ai64xo/socjus_streamer_hbomberguy_raises_over_230000_for/eelio9u/?sort=controversial)  \n\n[One user cites misreported information about the charity](https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/ai64xo/socjus_streamer_hbomberguy_raises_over_230000_for/eelk1jt/)   \n\n[\"HBomberguy is pretty far left and insane even for the SJW clique.

            "Okay, all of the other blatant antisemitism and general topmindery aside, let's just break down for a second just how fucking stupid this \"conspiracy\" is.\n\nPewDiePie donates $50000 to the ADL, so his viewers assume they *must* be blackmailing him. Except blackmailing him with...what, exactly? Some morons are suggesting they must be telling him that he either complies or they denounce him. Except the ADL *already* called him the fuck out, multiple times, and it didn't do jack shit; in fact, his subscriber numbers have *grown* since then. So they must be threatening him that they'll shut down his channel, since these \"all powerful Jewish media overlords\" can totally do that, right? Except if they had the kind of influence to do that, you think they wouldn't have done that shit *years* ago? Why now? And if he was being threatened with just having his channel shut down, you think he'd *only* be donating $50000? That's chump change to him. More than that, what the fuck do these people think shutting down his YouTube channel would do? Do they think he wouldn't have an alternate source of revenue, and that he'd know it, given he'd have proof that a vast ADL-led conspiracy tried to silence him? Again, this is concentrated fucking stupid.\n\nSo okay, let's assume for a moment that he *is* being blackmailed, but it's something that actually *would* harm him. Well the ADL condemning him didn't do it any of the times they already have, and they can't just shut down his channel, so what *would* harm him? Something material then, like a video of him doing something compromising. Okay, let's go with that then, so the video is...what, exactly? Felix saying the 'N' word? Wait, he already did that publicly. Doing a Nazi salute? Again, been there done that. Being openly homophobic, or Islamophobic? Who the fuck thinks that would actually damage him at this point? So it's got to be something really, *really* horrific, like...Felix murdering someone on camera. Or raping a child/someone's dog. Something really, really fucking sick that would actually, seriously damage his reputation and/or land him in jail. And if the ADL has something like that...then is PewDiePie still someone worth defending?\n\nAnd note, not for one second do I think the ADL has video proof of PewDiePie committing murder or being a pedophile or anything like that. Because he's quite obviously not being blackmailed, he's just a shitty dude that's finally getting uncomfortable being associated with his even shittier community. What I *am* pointing out is that the things he's *already done on camera* are so bad that literally the only thing he could currently be blackmailed with is something truly horrific and indefensible, something fucking *evil*. Which leaves the conspiracy theorists with two logical conclusions, either A) that no conspiracy to blackmail PewDiePie exists, or B) that he's being blackmailed with something so horrific even *they* couldn't back him up on it. Either way, not a good look.\n\nNo one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the far right, but Jesus Christ, it really does boggle my mind sometimes that people this fucking actively dense can even tie their shoes in the morning, much less speak the same language as the rest of us. I genuinely don't even have the words to express the level of contempt I have for these people.",
            "The alt right is fucking ridiculous.",

            "He really needs to clarify why exactly he pulled the donation. There are plenty of legitimate reasons not support them, but leaving it vague just fuels the racists who hijacked it in the first place",

            "Isn't it ironic how PDP donated to the ADL to try to combat this very thing, but all it did was just bring his most vocal neo-Nazi fans out into the open for everyone to see? I gotta be honest here, while I appreciate his donation and his attempt to try to make it right, it's definitely not playing out how he probably expected it to at all. And this is exactly why you don't try to court the alt right, you tell them to fuck right off as soon as you notice any and put your fucking fist down about it. There is absolutely no way it ends well for you, even if you try to change and better yourself eventually.",

We need to return to something more akin to what the founding fathers designed, with democratically elected officials serving as a balance to appointed officials and visa versa.

If former elected officials couldn't be prosecuted for crimes they commited before or while being in office, that would just mean that criminal behavior by elected officials would get a hard pass. \n\nThis is also ties in deeper into other areas. Trump not releasing his tax returns might have just seen as some petty act, but since we got the latest information updates, it might have hidden a national security threat. To me this makes one thing clear: future presidents should not be immune from being prosecuted for crimes they commited prior to them taking office. This isn't about Trump himself.

Even the [drugs creator Merck is warning](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-merck-antiparasite/merck-warns-against-using-anti-parasite-drug-to-treat-covid-19-idUSKBN2A42L1) against its use for COVID as well.\n\n**Unapproved use of Ivermectin is risky** and has great potential for overdose or interaction with other medicines.  From the FDA link above:\n\n>Even the levels of ivermectin for approved uses can interact with other medications, like blood-thinners. You can also overdose on ivermectin, which can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypotension (low blood pressure), allergic reactions (itching and hives), dizziness, ataxia (problems with balance), seizures, coma and even death. \n\nHowever, since these people have been convinced it is their latest COVID-19 cureall and they can not get it through legitimate means, many are [now raiding tractor supply stores to take horse, sheep, and dog worm medicine that has ivermectin as its active ingredient](https://www.thedailybeast.com/demon-sperm-doctors-new-bogus-cure-has-covid-truthers-eating-horse-paste).\n\nThis is even worse because the animal medicine they are using is about 2% Ivermectin with the vast amount of other drugs components undisclosed and used for those animals.  [Here is an example of the classification data on just one of the horse pastes that these people are being encouraged to take that is 95% undisclosed and has a long list of hazards for human use](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E9OHK1FWYAAdH31?format=jpg&name=large_) including infertility and damage to organs.  \n\nThe number of people raiding these farm stores for animal medicine is leading to [several hospitalizations and flooding of state poison control centers](https://www.npr.org/2021/08/23/1030208101/mississippi-livestock-drug-ivermectin-covid-misinformation).\n\nThe fact is that Ivermectin has no proof it can treat or prevent COVID-19.  Taking human-approved Ivermectin is dangerous without doctor's advice and can lead to hospitalization or death.  Taking **Animal Medicine is hugely dangerous**, not okay for human consumption, and can damage your fucking organs or kill you.\n\nYou mention the dangers of drinking bleach.  I am sure you have heard all about the many dangers of hydroxchloroquine.  This is the just the latest in a long line of grifts and dangerous misinformation around COVID-19 treatments.\n\nYou have an opportunity to make a stand and stop the spread of disinformation and are choosing instead to actively enable it.  \n\nShameful, but not surprising.",

While I think money definitely played a part in this decision, I am willing to give them the benefit of the doubt that they did this to keep the service open in China so Chinese gamers don't lose access to their games. I don't know the specifics on how GOG runs in China so I am going to assume it runs somewhat similarly to our version.

Rachat has been removed. /u/ThatKiwiLawyer has made [a post to CringeAnarchy][20] detailing the admin response.\n\nHere's the full text of the message:\n\n> Hi Mods,\n> \n> We\u2019ve seen your [open letter](https://www.reddit.com/r/CringeAnarchy/comments/bg9uur/an_open_letter_to_the_admins_our_plan_of_action/) and subsequent post for new mods. \n> \n> However, we continue to have serious concerns about your subreddit and your ability to keep it within the rules, especially given behavior we have seen today.\n> \n> We note that you have added new mods. However, we are extremely concerned at your and the Community\u2019s treatment of the mods. Harassment, bullying, and abuse are against Reddit\u2019s rules, and we expect you not to tolerate it or participate in it. Posts [like this,](https://www.reddit.com/r/CringeAnarchy/comments/bgmmi2/drewiepoodle_going_for_a_stroll/) which target individual mods by name for abuse, are unacceptable. \n> \n> Simply re-emphasizing the current content policy is not a sufficient response to quarantine and our note of yesterday. We have seen very specific and direct calls for violence or glorification of violence that are being reported but not removed by the mod team. We need you to be aware of calls for violence and ensure they are removed. We\u2019ve added a few examples below from just the past two weeks, but there are many more - we recommend reviewing the admin removed comments and posts in your mod logs to fully understand the type of content we\u2019re consistently seeing and removing in your sub.\n> [Example 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/CringeAnarchy/comments/becyef/we_will_replace_you/el609uz/)\n> [Example 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/CringeAnarchy/comments/baldj3/the_top_ones_i_got_no_problem_with/ekdecb0/)\n> [Example 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/CringeAnarchy/comments/bdk2qx/guess_whos_happy_about_notre_dame/ekywm92/\n> [Example 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/CringeAnarchy/comments/bcaeap/highest_order_cringe/ekph6uo/)\n> [Example](https://www.reddit.com/r/CringeAnarchy/comments/bb44m2/nogs_attack_man_in_chicago_he_pulls_a_gun/ekhbizn/)\n> [Example 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/CringeAnarchy/comments/bbl49p/_/ekjmoeh/)\n> [Example 6](https://www.reddit.com/r/CringeAnarchy/comments/ba0k8e/halfnaked_women_get_thousands_of_upvotes_how_many/) \n> The last example was posted by a mod. We actioned this individual accordingly, but this example is particularly concerning - it sends a signal to the community that it is okay to post violating content. \n> \n> Because this behavior has been allowed and encouraged in the past and perpetuated by the mods (see example above), it appears your subreddit has cultivated a culture of violence that will be a challenge to curb. This has led to threats of extreme violence against the [Reddit HQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/CringeAnarchy/comments/bg8ld7/broke_reddit_admins_police_violent_speech_to/), and to individual admins, and [predictions of future violence](https://www.reddit.com/r/CringeAnarchy/comments/b9y4e5/august_1st_2019_honk_honk/?). As you can imagine, we (and in cases where they see it, the authorities) take any predictions of or calls to violence extremely seriously. This type of content is beyond unacceptable and has no place on Reddit. This cannot continue, and we need to see movement towards a culture change in your subreddit. \n> \n> We acknowledge your passion for the Community, but it is not enough to say you want to change the culture of your community. We need to see evidence that you are actually capable of doing it if we are to keep your subreddit active. As such, we\u2019re giving you until Thursday at 5pm EST to right your ship, give your new mods time to acclimate, and ensure rules are being properly enforced.\n\n###Update 9 (4/25 3:22 PM UTC)\n\n[The top mod announces that there is a plan to move to Gab.com][21].\n\n###Update 10 (4/25 4:06 PM UTC)\n\nAs of a few days ago, a few subreddits such as /r/Cringetopia and /r/Drama have started auto banning /r/CringeAnarchy users in preparation for their ban.\n\nHere is [the Cringetopia announcement][22] as well as the [Drama announcement][23].\n\n[A post made by a user][24] jokingly implying that if it was upvoted that \"CAnimals would die\" has been [removed by the reddit admins][25].

        "selftext": "So first some background:  \n  \nYandere Simulator is a game developed by a guy going as Yandere Dev. He has been working on the game for several years now and has gained a considerable following on youtube, twitter and reddit. Over the years, more and more people began criticizing Yandere Dev for his bad code, bad game design, creepy past and his inability to finish the game despite having a patreon. With Yandere Dev acting hostile towards these criticisms he has only gained so much criticism that it has turned into hate. Entire hate communities were made around him, memes were born (the yandere dev discord ban speedrun) and now only the die-hard fans are still staying by his side.  \n  \nI said that Yandere Dev has a significant following on reddit, and that is in the form of r/yandere_simulator. r/yandere_simulator was a place were you could discuss Yandere Simulator. About a year ago, Yandere Dev started to get his first lumps of criticism, and r/yandere_simulator started to get lots of posts criticising Yandere Dev. Yandere Dev didn't like this and wanted the criticism gone. So what did he do? He [bought the subreddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/Drama/comments/9zufpm/yandere_dev_has_decided_to_purchase_the_subreddit/) for [3000 dollars](https://old.reddit.com/r/Osana/comments/ffsxcv/alex_bought_ryandere_simulator_for_3000/), became the head mod of the sub and banned any hater/critic of the subreddit. The subreddit became a safe haven for Yander Simulator fans and the criticizers went to other subreddit to complain about Yander Dev, with the biggest one being r/Osana (a reference to the rival in the game that has been coming for years).   \n  \n**So, what happened today?**  \n  \nWell, like the title said, /u/YandereDev got hacked.  \n  \n[A guy named Null hacked the account](https://old.reddit.com/r/yandere_simulator/comments/hkvost/attention_redditors/) and [immediately removed every mod including the YandereDev account from the mod team](https://old.reddit.com/r/Osana/comments/hkwf2a/the_mods_have_been_removed/).  \n  \n/u/Finaser552, an acount that heavily criticized Yandere Dev, [was appointed as a moderator for the subreddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/Osana/comments/hkx254/so_uh_im_a_yansim_mod_now_slowly_morphs_into_30/). With this power, [he unbanned every person that was previously banned except for the original mods](https://old.reddit.com/r/yandere_simulator/comments/hkz237/everyone_but_the_mods_are_unbanned_now_roam_free/) which the mods of r/Osana claimed were over [5 thousand unbans](https://old.reddit.com/r/Osana/comments/hkzxk9/every_single_person_who_was_banned_from_ryandere/)    \n  \nr/Yandere_Simulator is now in complete chaos with lots of people clowning on Yandere Dev. r/Osana, the biggest sub to criticize Yandere Dev, has said that [they were not responsible for the subreddit being hacked](https://old.reddit.com/r/Osana/comments/hkwpzm/regarding_ryandere_simulator_being_hacked/)  \n  \nWe will have to wait and see what will happen with Yandere Dev, the subreddit and the hacker Null.  \n  \n**Small update:** [One of the original mods (that got banned) came out on r/Osana expressins his frustration](https://old.reddit.com/r/Osana/comments/hl1c66/dear_rosana_youre_responsible_of_this_situation/)   \n   \n*The mods of r/Osana gave a reminder to keep things civil, so don't harass anyone on that thread, on this thread or anywhere on r/Osana or r/Yandere_Simulator*  \n  \n#**[Here is an update post on what happened two weeks later](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/hvzx5y/after_the_subreddit_getting_hacked_yandere_dev)**  \n  \n#**[Second Update Post](https://old.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/hvzx5y/after_the_subreddit_getting_hacked_yandere_dev/)**",

Like his use of sexuality in the game and other stupid shit, mainly, but other things as well. While he was obviously a pervert, I never saw that as a problem, if people want to make or play games where the main attraction is staring at virtual tits and ass, whatever, I don't mind. But I'd be lying if I said being so defensive about it didn't skew my opinion of the person being defensive. If it really doesn't matter, just shut up about it. But that's not what he did. He made tons of responses to anyone in order to soothe his ego. That became more apparent the more I heard about him or saw more of his videos.\n\nLater I learned he basically just stole assets from others to make his game and then all of this, I believe the \"creepy past\" you mentioned (though I've retained none of this information so if anything bad did happen I don't remember what it was, only vaguely hearing about it).\n\nGuy comes off as a real grade-A douchebag.

The law is the law. It doesn't have bullshit loopholes about what is being advertised.\nPlus allowing people to line up outside of a store in the hundreds when you know the store only had 20 sauce cups is basically proof their advertising didn't come close to conveying expectations. And letting people stand outside for hours knowing you only had 20 is also fucked up. They could have at any time told the crowd they only had 20 sauce cups so the crowd would dispurse and people wouldn't waste hours of time.

Like, wanting a guy to torpedo his career over a godawfully wrongheaded lawsuit seems like a bad way to get some kicks.\n\nWait, he's serious?\n\nGoddamn.\n\n>Notice on black friday how stores list a minimum quantity? That is the result of losing lawsuits. We have truth in advertising laws that don't let you understock something you over advertise just to try to get secondary sales from customers who fail to get what they wanted since they are now in the store.\n\nNo, they're really not.  All of the cases involving Black Friday sales are about the (debatably legal) practice of raising prices artificially in order to mark them down more significantly.  i.e. a dress which ought to cost $200 being marked up to $300 two weeks before Black Friday, and then dropped down to $150.  What should be considered 25% off is reported as 50% off.\n\nOr just not selling them at the advertised price without letting customers know at points of sale.  That's kind of a no-no.\n\nExplicit statements of supply have nothing to do with \"we ran out\" being legally wrong.  It has to do with *customers* being savvy enough to know that they're being enticed into the store with a limited number of the best deals and becoming discontented about it.\n\n>This is why mcdonald's is spamming the phrase \"super-limited quantities\" on social media right now. They know they fucked up and want to try to cover their ass with the word \"super\". If a ps4 ad said super-limited, I would expect less than 5 per store and as little as 1. But this is a sauce cup being offered for 1 day. You expect sauce to last the day, super-limited would refer to it being 1 day only.\n\nPersonal expectations are not tied to whether something is legally false advertising, a limited supply explicitly conveys that there is no guarantee that the sauce will be available in sufficient quantities for everyone who wants it.\n\nAnd since the ads were for limited supplies *and* a limited time, you can't really argue that the former just meant the latter.\n\n>But the fact is if they said 10-20 per store, almost no one would have shown up. And their sales data for the day will most likely prove they sold more food today due to this promotion even though no one was able to get the sauce they came out for.\n\nMaybe, but \"I had insufficient information to know with certainty\" isn't the same thing as \"I was misled.\"  Even if a given person wouldn't have shown up without the possibility of sauce, at no point did McDonald's guarantee its availability.\n\n>People can laugh and say the law should treat a sauce cup different than a ps4, but it doesn't. The law is the law. It doesn't have bullshit loopholes about what is being advertised.\n\nIn the sense that false advertising is possible with either?  Sure.\n\nIn the sense that this actually *is* false advertising?  Not so much.  I'll let the FTC explain:\n\n\"**They also can comply** by ordering quantities of the item sufficient to meet reasonably anticipated demand or **by disclosing in ads that items are available only in limited quantities** or only at some stores. Although the specific terms of the Rule apply only to retail food stores, other companies advertising products available in limited quantity or only at some stores may want to make similar disclosures to reduce the risk of deception\"\n\n>Plus allowing people to line up outside of a store in the hundreds when you know the store only had 20 sauce cups is basically proof their advertising didn't come close to conveying expectations\n\nA company is not required to poll its customers on *why* they're waiting in line, and then to inform them of the exact amount of a product is available and everyone else should leave.\n\nFTC rules protect consumers against *actual* fraud and deception; misstatements, misleading statements, and outright lies.  They do not protect against \"they told me there was a limited amount but didn't tell me exactly how much they had.\"\n\n>Why not? Fuck 'em. If someone has the time/money/legal resources to waste on it I would love to see that play out. One could easily argue false or deceptive advertising.\n\nOne could argue that easily.\n\nOne cannot argue that easily and *win*.\n\n>Alright, Abe Fortas, by what procedural mechanism exactly?\n\nMotion to dismiss for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted (arguing that even if the plaintiff can prove there were limited quantities, disclosing that pretty much solves it), then a motion for summary judgment.\n\nGoddamn, *Twombly* is almost exactly on point.\n\n> Frivolous lawsuit? Fuck yeah. If this was some case where taxpayer dollars would be wasted it would be a completely different situation. But I'm gonna stick with the \"Red Bull\" defense and if an energy product can get sued for not LITERALLY MAKING YOU ABLE TO FLY I'm gonna go ahead and say it's possible.\n\nFirst, never happened.  Energy drink companies have been sued for making false claims about health and energy benefits (like claiming that special ingredients did something on top of the sugar and caffeine).\n\nSecond, they *explicitly told you that it was limited*.\n\nGoddamned internet lawyers.",

A week later only 2 had been removed.\n* BBC created non-english accounts explicitly stating they were young teenagers selling photos. Neither were removed until BBC contacted OnlyFans\n\nHonestly the report so far is a disaster for OnlyFans - and who knows what else the BBC is holding back on?\n\nMy guess is investors/payment processors got wind of this.

They are trying soooooo hard to take a shit on anything regarding black lives no matter how irrelevant the context may be. \n\nIt\u2019s literally been almost a year now, and Floyd/or just about anything related to black person takes up mansion-level space living inside their head rent-free.",
            "I hope someone mentioned Ronald Reagan",
            "He\u2019s not treated like a saint. His death was wrongful and it was the last straw. He\u2019s seen as himself but also as a symbol of justice because this happened to so many other people before him.",
            "It was brought up a lot when the protests were happening, because people seemed to think it was at all what the protests were about.\n\nHe was the straw that broke the camel's back. Of course he had a shitty past. We knew that. Granted, at that time I'm pretty sure he was out of prison and moving on with his life, but it doesn't matter what he was doing, because **the movement wasn't about him.**\n\nIt was about what happened to him. In broad daylight. In front of a group of pedestrians. With a recording.\n\nA cop murdered a man in front of people and almost got away with it. It being a black man was probably just what was needed to stir up the BLM protestors and really kick off the protests in full, but for a lot of people it was just that a cop thought he could murder someone and get away with it, scot-free.",
            "What's even crazier is people justifying his death at the hands of the Police by bringing up his past crimes. Like, bitch, he already served time for that. What the fuck was he doing out in the world and not behind bars if he was that terrible? Sounds to me like the criminal justice system is broken, then? He was no saint but don't let a Cop's dick get so far up your ass for fuck's sake!",
            "We don't use his name as a glorified messiah or anything. He wasn't a good person. However, the police are not judge, jury and executioner. George should've been arrested and had his day in court, as his rights under the US constitution allow. *That's* why people wanted justice.",

            "Police are not the branch of law to determine guilt or the branch to execute punishment (especially capital punishment) so it does not matter how good or bad of a person George Floyd may or may not have been during the time he was alive. \n\nUsing his criminal background as an excuse for the excessive force should not be tolerated. \n\nAlthough if I were a cop and I were actually forced to kill a person out of self defense I would feel better morally if he were a horrible person. But even then it shouldn\u2019t be used as sole justification for the force. But of course that is not the case with George Floyd. He was killed out of cold blood by a cop who had multiple excessive force complaints and had been moved station to station so he could keep working despite those complaints. \n\nGeorge Floyd may not have been a good person by looking through his past written on paper. But for all we know he was not the same man written on the reports. What we do know is that cop is a bad person and should be held accountable for it.",
            "I like how the person who though John Lennon was a bad person didn\u2019t mention anything about him being a horrible person to his son, but that he was a bad person because he was a communist, I\u2019m assuming because of \u201cImagine\u201d.\n\nThe fucker completely abandoned his wife and his son when he met Yoko Ono. He\u2019s a massive asshole.",
            "The question is: is he a celebrity?\n\nBefore he died he was not. But I would say that after death he become one. So including him is valid.\n\nI love how people jump immediately saying that who he was had nothing to do with what happened to him. That's true but that's also another conversation.\n\nYes he was an aweful person. Yes he did not deserve to die this way.",
            "I mean, he was a shitty person though, right?  The fact that he\u2019s a shitty person has nothing to do with the police murdering him, and the police absolutely should be held accountable for that kind of behavior.  But the dude clearly was a bad person."
