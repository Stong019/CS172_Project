He donates shit loads to charity, helps fix actual problems for 3rd world countries, developed a fucking toilet that produces clean drinking water and implemented it. But no just because he\u2019s rich and cheated on his wife he\u2019s a terrible person.

Not to mention almost all of the people using PCs to view reddit are using a windows OS.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Bill Gates can solve world hunger, electrification and water shortages worldide 3 times over but chooses to only give the world lip service, the bare minimum to have people think he's a good guy.

The average middle class American makes a bit over 2 million dollars in their lifetime. He has donated 40 billion dollars which is over 30% of his net worth. I doubt that 40 billion fucking dollars is \u201cthe bare minimum\u201d.

According to court statements, he literally ran out of cash in early 2020 and had to take out loans using part of tesla as collateral to be able to live.*\n\n*To \u201cthen how does he make money?\u201d, the answer is that he doesn\u2019t. He lives off loans put up against the value of his companies. He\u2019s taking up debt to live, literally making negative money, planning that his companies will eventually be profitable. If not, he can sell them to pay off his debt.*\n\n*The biggest problem of the \u201cElon Musk has \\_\\_ billion dollars\u201d statement is that it would be literally impossible for him to get all that money. Most of his \u201cwealth\u201d comes from the value of stock that he has in his companies. The problem is that when stock in a company is sold, the price goes down. So yea, he might have millions or billions or whatever worth of stock in tesla, but it is only worth that much assuming that it is never sold. As soon as he goes to sell it, it\u2019s instantly worth nothing.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome more drama\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/ntb6dv/elon_musk_is_actually_a_bad_person/h0rufup?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n*There are only 2 billionaires that I genuinely like: bill gates and Larry page*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*If you like Bill Gates you may need to think again*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*First off what\u2019s wrong with Gates, second off Page is the bigger problem*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Gates uses his influence to help out big pharma companies. The Indian Medical association asked to ban Bill Gates' foundation and the govt complied, because Gates was coming in to destroy India's generic pharmaceutical industry that supplies cheap drugs to Africa and instead replace that supply line with expensive drugs from his friends.*\n\n*The Oxford covid vaccine was supposed to be patent free but Gates swooped in and brought AstraZeneca as a partner to license the vaccine, which Oxford wanted to put out for free for anyone to manufacture.*\n\n*Recently, he was also strongly lobbying against removing patents from covid vaccines, since it would hurt his big pharma friends. Bill Gates and his foundation are THE way for American and European pharma companies to kill competition that manufacture drugs for the global south. He is the enemy of the poor of this world, not a friend.

            "About a month ago my fiance and I went to see First Man in IMAX. There was a seat separating my fiance and another couple that was in their 50s, the woman being closer to my fiance than the man. She kept loudly talking to her husband and playing games on her phone. We asked her multiple times to stop. The last time my fiance was literally pleading with her to stop, and she deliberately ignored him. I reached over his lap and started moving the seat next to her trying to get her attention. She suddenly snapped and shouted \"WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME!\" My fiance told her to shut up and put her phone away. She said \"I am checking on my children! Do you know what it's like to have children???\" My fiance told her \"Yes! a babysitter! Why can't you leave your kids alone for a couple hours without texting them?\" And I pointed out that I could actually see her phone and she hadn't texted anyone once, right before we talked to her for the nth time she had been looking at wedding pictures on google images. She asked why we were sitting there as if we had deliberately planned to sit there to tell her to stop talking and using her phone at full brightness through the whole movie. She told us to just move if we don't like it. I told her she should move because she's not even watching the movie. Her husband offered to move a few seats down but she indignantly said no. People were starting to stare so I told her to just shut up. She didn't say anything or pull out her phone for the rest of the movie though!",

I get sick of it and tell her to put it away, she gets pissed off at me and huffy. Ruins the movie because it's a full house and neither of us can move.\n\n2) This has happened several times. A woman sits in almost the front row or the front row and gets out her phone on a regular basis. I complain to management almost every time, usually nothing happens. They just shrug their shoulders and say \"Well, she didn't have it out when I checked\". \n\n3) Three people in a Saturday afternoon movie. This woman in the front row decides to SUCK ON PEANUTS the whole fucking movie. No joke. I complained. She hides the peanuts when the usher comes in. She does it again. I complain again. She hides them again. I complain to her directly. She basically tells me to fuck off. I go get usher again. Nothing happens. I think she finally stopped for the last 20 minutes of the movie or so. I was fucking pissed and confronted her as we are leaving. She gets super bitchy and then security shows up. She leaves as fast as she can (she was limping or something).

However if it\u2018s not clearly said in the movie everyone is free to interpret for themselves and at the end of the day they are just the plain evil guys, irredeemable and okay to slaughter. It\u2018s perfectly fine to criticise this trope, I myself do it often. I think Miyazaki\u2018s point of view is very interesting and the parallels he draws between lotr and america\u2018s thirst for war are definitely valid.

I know they are elves corrupted by Melkor, but are they no longer sentient and capable of some degree of free will? Also, if they are Eru Iluvatar's children, even if corrupted by Melkor, don't they have to have *some* goodness in them somewhere? Logically, even Melkor isn't the opposite of Eru Iluvatar.

While some people certainly did view the Japanese as subhuman, what Japan did during world war 2 was arguably terrible, and should be condemned, and yet Miyazaki harps on national pride and historical perspective here, which I sure hope he's not condoning the actions of Imperial Japan during world war 2, because massive fucking yikes.",
            "I agree with part of what he says, but just because his works don\u2019t glorify violence or have a sense of otherness does not mean anime as a whole doesn\u2019t. He is painting as a foreign problem when it exists there as well.",

Everyone knows you hate Hollywood and hate action movies and hate CG and hate anime and hate your son. You go on and on about it. I have literally never heard a relatable or personable story about Miyazaki. They are exclusively about how he is a grumpy old dick who is rude to everyone that doesn't kowtow to his idea of what art should be.",

Yet there has been no attempt to hold anybody responsible. Nor have we in any way repatriated the Iraqi people. \n\nMost of our media and cultural institutions shifted rapidly to out-and-out propaganda mills. Not to mention the war criminals we've created and continue to harbor. We were wrong as a people. Quite like the Nazi's were. Yet we all just continue on like nothing happened."

            "I mean...I'm honestly one of those bleeding heart liberals who thinks that discrimination and prejudice are institutional issues, so it doesn't matter how personally likeable or distasteful an individual is, if they're suffering institutional discrimination, that should be dealt with accordingly. I think you'll find all sorts of opinions and views you'd disagree with in every oppressed group in society. There are plenty of alt-right gay men too, but the fact that they're alt-right doesn't change the fact that they face homophobia in society and suffer because of it. Similarly, I think that discrimination against travellers should be dealt with in European society because discrimination against any oppressed group is bad, and it sets a poor precedent for acceptable treatment in society.\n\nTHAT BEING SAID, it's really so depressing and infuriating when those same people don't have the same empathy and compassion for others that they want for themselves. You can tell in these instances that these are the people who are angry about the discrimination they face, not because they want a just and equitable world, but rather because they wish they had been born into the privileged group. To them, a just and equitable world is one where they have the power to oppress whoever they think is undesirable in society, not one where every human is free from discrimination.\n\nAnyway, what's really sad about all of this is that there are actual LGBT travellers who are faced with the dual task of fighting against discrimination and xenophobia from people who aren't travellers, as well as homophobia and misogyny and whatnot from their own community.

If the 80% Hindu population wanted to eradicate 15-18% of Muslims, it would have happened a long time ago.\n\nThis is a weird trope one sees occasionally, people way overestimating how easy it is to commit genocide. Which sounds weird, but, like, it took the Nazis six years to kill two thirds of Europe's Jews, a group who were only like 2% of the population, had little organized resistance, and had no nation-state backers in the cases where they did resist. This was also before modern guerilla tactics had been really refined. To assume that India could just casually kill 200 million people (without nuking itself) is idiotic.\n\nIt also completely ignores the political reasons a major global power might want to be a touch more subtle in its persecution.",

        "selftext": "**Edit:**\n\n*Just to make this clear, pretty much the entirety of this post is me communicating the opinions, outrage, and accusations of others, rather than what I, personally, believe. The only two parts of this post where I inject my personal opinion are here:*\n\n> *Many users in this group* ***(quite reasonably)*** *complained that they had the right to do as they wished with their money, and that they were being harassed by fans to join the boycott.*\n\n*And here:*\n\n> *Having seen a few of these \"My Position on Dexit\" videos,* ***I am inclined to agree.***\n\n*This post has a strong anti-Dexit bias because that is the general opinion of r/pokemon right now, and the drama on r/pokemon is what I was trying to communicate in this sub. I tried to make that clear by using phrases such as \"some people have claimed...\" or \"the opinion of the sub was that...\" Obviously I didn't make this clear enough, and I apologise. FWIW, I'm honestly not personally effected by Dexit since I don't even own a Switch, so I'm not too bothered one way or another.*\n\n**TL;DR:** Pokemon screws over its fans significantly more than normal, experiences massive backlash for not just this screwing-over but all screwings-over in the past. Official response somehow manages to make fans even more mad.\n\nThis is a crosspost from r/HobbyDrama. I think it fits here, because all of the links and examples I pointed to are from r/pokemon, which is currently a hotbed of drama. Feel free to remove it if this post doesn't fit the sub.\n\n#Setting the Stage:\n\nTo understand Dexit, you first need to understand the difference between a Regional Pokedex and a National Pokedex.\n\n* Each main series game has its own **Regional Dex,** which is a full list of every Pokemon that can be found in the wild *within that game.* Due to the huge number of Pokemon, there is no main series game where every Pokemon can be caught in-game.\n\n* There is one, singular **National Dex,** which is a full list of every Pokemon *ever.*\n\nIn every game so far, it's been possible to transfer Pokemon from one game to another - even if that Pokemon doesn't appear in the new game's Regional Dex. There are many reasons why somebody would want to do this:\n\n* To complete the National Dex, the ultimate in-game achievement.\n\n* Some people have strong sentimental attachments to particular individual Pokemon.\n\n* Competitive players spend huge amounts of time breeding Pokemon with very specific stats.\n\n* **Shiny Pokemon** are Pokemon that have an alternate colour scheme. A Pokemon has a ~1/8000 chance of being shiny, so are treasured beyond belief if a player is lucky enough to find one. Players with a shiny obviously want to transfer this jewel in their Pokemon crown to the newest game.\n\n#Part 1: The Trailer (or; People are (Mostly) Happy)\n\nOn **June 5th,** [the trailer for the new main series games, Pokemon Sword and Shield, dropped.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_dgvgpC8Nw) The reaction from fans was largely positive - the setting, particularly the towns and cities, looked absolutely gorgeous. Fans also liked the designs of the new Pokemon, particularly [Scorbunny](https://imgur.com/7I0wCYC) and [Woolloo.](https://imgur.com/FbZzmzl)\n\nThere was some light-hearted fun poked at the kind-of-silly designs of the two new \"title legendaries\" (special and powerful Pokemon, who are major bosses). There was also some more genuine criticism of the new **Dynamaxing** mechanic, where players can [temporarily turn their Pokemon supersize mid-battle to get stat boosts.](https://imgur.com/TrIGunZ) The reason for this criticism is because Dynamaxing replaces **Mega Evolution.** Although both mechanics do largely the same thing, Dynamaxing just scales up the Pokemon's model, while Mega Evolution gave the Pokemon an entirely new design. Fans felt that Dynamaxing was a lazy cop-out, especially since they'd been looking forward to seeing new Mega Evolution designs in Sword and Shield.\n\nExcept for the minor Dynamaxing drama, however, the reception of the new games was largely positive and most fans were looking forward to more information. The tease of open-world areas, in particular, led to massive excitement.\n\n#Part 2: Nintendo Treehouse (or; People are No Longer Happy)\n\nOn **June 11th,** [Nintendo Treehouse (aka E3) took place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmWu-f6L0Mo), a conference/information session that released new information about the eagerly-awaited Sword and Shield.\n\nSeveral things were revealed during that conference:\n\n1. Some gameplay was shown, in which the open-world graphics appeared *terrible.*\n\n2. The bomb droppped - **only Pokemon in Sword and Shield's Regional Dex would be coded into the game.** This means that transferring Pokemon into Sword and Shield would be impossible, unless that Pokemon was catchable in Sword and Shield anyway.\n\nThis had never happened before. Questionable graphics? People were used to them. Gimmick-ey mechanics? Normal enough. Beloved features being removed? The Pokemon community are veterans at dealing with that. But in every single main series game to date - a twenty-year history - the National Dex has been present. The removal of the National Dex is *huge.*\n\nTo make matters worse, Masuda (the producer) claimed that the removal of the National Dex was for the following reasons:\n\n* There are now nearly 1000 Pokemon in total, and \"it would have been necessary at some point\" to start cutting down.\n\n* By limiting the number of Pokemon, GameFreak (the company) can instead focus their resources on making the graphics for all of the present Pokemon, and the rest of the game, top-tier.\n\nTo put it simply, there were riots - the video of Nintendo Treehouse had a 21K/80K like:dislike ratio. The general consensus of the sub was this: Masuda says that the resources gained from sacrificing some Pokemon go towards brilliant graphics, but the graphics are actually terrible. [This tree](https://imgur.com/8GHcIz2) became a symbol of the graphics problems overall, with many fans using [Breath of the Wild](https://np.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/c24hnj/graphics_of_pokemon_swordshield_vs_breath_of_the/) as an example of what \"top-tier\" graphics *should* look like. \n\nAnother issue people took was the video of a certain bird Pokemon (\"Wingull\") flying around in the open world without even flapping its wings. To prove the sub's point, [one amateur animator made a far superior model in 24 hours,](https://np.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/c28top/i_fixed_the_wingull_animation_from_scratch_hope/) effectively demonstrating that the \"extra resources dedicated to existing Pokemon\" argument is utter bullshit.\n\nYet another nail in the coffin of the \"better graphics\" argument is that two main series games ago, when the franchise made the leap from 2D sprites to 3D models, high-quality 3D models and animations of every single Pokemon (at the times) were made, and designed to be future-proof. The footage clearly showed that these models haven't been significantly improved upon, so the work of importing them into the game is minimal.\n\nThe tiny size (in terms of data) of Pokemon games in comparison to games such as Skyrim was also raised to reject the claim that 1000 Pokemon is too many for the Switch to handle.\n\nOh yeah, and Sword and Shield were announced to cost $60 rather than the usual $40 - a 50% increase in price for what looks like a 50% drop in quality.\n\nIn short, r/pokemon was flooded with [memes, complaints and calls for a boycott.](https://np.reddit.com/r/pokemon/search?q=wingull&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all) The event came to be known as \"Dexit\" (Sword and Shield are set in a region based off Great Britain, so it's really quite a clever name). #BringBackNationalDex even trended on Twitter for a period of time. Huge numbers of players announced that they were abandoning any new entries to the franchise, and sticking with the current games only. Above all this drama was the one, overarching question - Pokemon is the largest media franchise in the world, outstripping the likes of Star Wars and the MCU. Where, exactly, was all this revenue even going, if not to the games?\n\n#Part 2.5 The Rise of the Anti-Anti-Dexiteers\n\nA small but significant portion of the sub's userbase, however, were largely fine with this decision. Many users in this group (quite reasonably) complained that they had the right to do as they wished with their money, and that they were being harassed by fans to join the boycott. There was also (I believe) a false allegation of rape by Masuda made by an individual claiming to support the anti-Dexit campaign. Anti-anti-Dexiteers claim that this person was genuinely against Dexit, while anti-Dexiteers accuse the false accuser of secretly being an anti-anti-Dexiteer smearing the anti-Dexit movement.\n\nAnother significant group of anti-anti-Dexiteers are Pokemon-centric Youtubers, or **Poketubers** for short. Many anti-Dexiteers have accused them of not only supporting Dexit, but of using disingenuous and objectively false statements to support their position. Having seen a few of these \"My Position on Dexit\" videos, I am inclined to agree. Many anti-Dexiteers believe that these Poketubers are attempting to drum up support for Sword and Shield, because the more interest there is in the franchise, the more money they will make on their videos.\n\nI will reiterate that the anti-anti-Dexiteers are a very small minority (and I, personally, wish them happiness with the games if they genuinely enjoy them). \n\n\n#Part 3: The Straw that Broke the Camerupt's Back (or; It Gets Worse)\n\nUnfortunately for the producers, Dexit became the straw that broke the camel's back. r/Pokemon is notoriously forgiving of low-quality content, with reasonable criticisms being downvoted into oblivion.\n\nNot any more.\n\nLike the flick of a switch, the entire community suddenly found it acceptable - even encouraged - to point out things that had been verboten earlier. The slow but unmistakable decline in quality over the past 5-ish years of Pokemon was suddenly a talking point that wouldn't get you sent to the naughty corner, and fans eagerly expressed their long-suppressed grievances. The dwindling amount of post-game content. The refusal to develop new mechanics, instead abandoning and replacing them. The steadily declining creativity and effort put into each replacement gimmick. The clear lack of any kind of passion put into the newer games. While legendary Pokemon used to be integrated into the story, with heapings of lore, recently they've just been given out with no effort put into the mythos surrounding them.\n\nIn short, the community slowly abandoned #BringBackNationalDex and moved on to #PokemonDeservesBetter.\n\n#Part 4: The Masuda Method (or; It Gets Even Worse)\n\nOn **June 28th,** just as the outcry was beginning to quieten down, Masuda himself responded to the drama with the following message:\n\n> Thank you to all of our fans for caring so deeply about Pok\u00e9mon. Recently, I shared the news that some Pok\u00e9mon cannot be transferred to Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Pok\u00e9mon Shield. I've read all your comments and appreciate your love and passion for Pok\u00e9mon.\n\n> Just like all of you, we are passionate about Pok\u00e9mon and each and every one of them is very important to us. After so many years of developing the Pok\u00e9mon video games, this was a very difficult decision for me. I'd like to make one thing clear: even if a specific Pok\u00e9mon is not available in Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Pok\u00e9mon Shield, that does not mean it will not appear in future games.\n\n> The world of Pok\u00e9mon continues to evolve. The Galar region offers new Pok\u00e9mon to encounter, Trainers to battle, and adventures to embark on. We are pouring our hearts into these games, and we hope you will look forward to joining us on this new journey.\n\n> Junichi Masuda\n\nThe sub's response is concisely summarised by [this comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/c6qgui/a_message_for_pok%C3%A9mon_video_game_fans/esao8ef/) by jenesuispasbavard:\n\n> Translation: \"Get fucked lol\"\n\nThe official response revealed basically nothing that wasn't already known, and users were *not happy.*\n\nThe full comments are [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/c6qgui/a_message_for_pok%C3%A9mon_video_game_fans/) for those interested in admiring the sheer level to which fans are unimpressed.\n\nTo make matters worse, it then came out that [**Gamefreak has assigned Pokemon to their B team, with the A team working on original projects.**](https://np.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/c9lylv/gamefreak_admits_pok%C3%A9mon_isnt_priority_sword_and/) This made r/pokemon even madder, because now, not only are they being given a shitty product, they're being told that the producers aren't even trying. The general opinion is that if Gamefreak is feeling burnt out by producing Pokemon, then that's fine, but they should transfer the franchise to another studio and pass the torch on. #FireMasuda starts making the rounds.\n\nThere is no conclusion to this drama in sight. The sub's main hope is that enough people will refuse to buy Sword and Shield that Game Freak and Masuda will actually be financially punished and incentivised to produce a quality product next time. Any hopes of a delay are dashed, because other parts of the franchise (e.g. the TCG and the TV show) need to have their schedules linked with the games, making delays impossible. It's tradition in the Pokemon games for a \"premium\" version of a main series game to be released later, with better graphics and new features. There are fears that a \"premium\" version of Sword and Shield will be released, in which all Pokemon will be offered - essentially making everyone pay extra for a feature that should really be core to the game.\n\nFor now, r/pokemon is rioting with no signs of stopping yet.",

            "I'm sure the graphics concerns are overblown. _clicks link_ Oh.\n\nRegarding the drama, it looks like Game Freak shot a bullet up in the air back when gen 2 was released, it's just taken until now for it to come back down and hit them in the foot. But at some point having all the pocket men was going to be a problem, even just at a storage level. I kind of understand the balance requirement - That's why TCGs have rotations. Seems like Game Freak should have said \"We're only including the last 4 gens in this game\"",

            "> Part 3: The Straw that Broke the Camerupt's Back (or; It Gets Worse)  \n>  \n>Unfortunately for the producers, Dexit became the straw that broke the camel's back. [r/Pokemon](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pokemon/) is notoriously forgiving of low-quality content, with reasonable criticisms being downvoted into oblivion.  \n>  \n>Not any more.  \n>  \n>Like the flick of a switch, the entire community suddenly found it acceptable - even encouraged - to point out things that had been verboten earlier. The slow but unmistakable decline in quality over the past 5-ish years of Pokemon was suddenly a talking point that wouldn't get you sent to the naughty corner, and fans eagerly expressed their long-suppressed grievances. The dwindling amount of post-game content. The refusal to develop new mechanics, instead abandoning and replacing them. The steadily declining creativity and effort put into each replacement gimmick.\n\nI'm honestly glad this happened. I'm tired of the Pokemon community just eating whatever Gamefreak put out without demanding more from them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe truly \"WTF\" moment happened for me with Diamond and Pearl and them removing the Battle Frontier (IIRC), only for them to bring it back with Platinum due to fan outcry. It was like \"why the hell did you remove it in the first place?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLike, I can get rid of berries and other useless cruft like that (some folks may enjoy making berries, but I don't see it adding value like the Battle Frontier or Mega Evolutions or...) and be fine: But good lord does Gamefreak has a tendency to completely remove features that fans thought were good in one game in the next one and fans don't call them out on that.",

            "I feel like its very much worth mentioning that people have to Pay real money for a cloud service to transfer their pokemon that now does nothing.",

            "Pokemon games are somehow the least profitable aspect of the franchise rn. I had no idea until this decor started up but supposedly the tcg, anime, merch, movies and of course Pokemon go all make the company far more money than the actual games.\n\nThis suggests a reason for swsh being developed by the b team, gamefreak is becoming a less important part of the Pokemon company and they are having to focus their attention elsewhere.\n\nAssuming this is all true cause I don't have sources or anything, it makes a lot more sense and even though I'm terribly upset by the decor decision, it really seems inevitable. Now I'm starting to worry that boycotts aren't going to convince the pokemom company they need to change their ways but instead just make the main series games even less important than they already were.\n\nAs a lifelong Pokemon fan this is pretty sad but what can we do in the end. The franchise still kinda revolves around the games so I think they're at least safe for a little while.\n\nIn terms of dexit in general, although I still hate the decision and fully agree with people calling it lazy I guess I'm kind of starting to care less and less now because Masudas statement really doesn't leave any room for hope... The national Dex is gone and it's not coming back in the foreseeable future.",
            "Jesus fuck the r/pokemon CSS is hot garbage.",
            "I'm very dissapointed about ShSw, but I'm also dissapointed in people who are saying Masuda should be fired, and the people who are making false rape allegations.",
            "You know, I keep seeing people say the Part 3 point, \"Nobody could criticize GameFreak without being downvoted into oblivion!\" but like, as someone who liked US/UM? I gotta say that r/Pokemon has had NO problem criticizing the games or shit. Like, this is not some silent oppressed majority suddenly rising up (GAMERS RISE UP).\n\nHonestly, as a Pokemon fan since the R/B days? I don't really care. I get why it is disappointing. I will not blame anyone who does not want the game. People should like and dislike what they want. Buy and not buy what they want. Nothing wrong with wanting more or something different. But I would appreciate not being called a shill or a bootlicker for this not really kicking me off Sw/Sh. Especially from anyone who has bought more than one version of a game. :p\n\nI'm also pretty iffy on all the \"this game is shit\" arguments at this point. Not to say that it is impossible, but no one has seen the whole game. We do not know if there are additional animations for something like an expanded amie. We do not know if there is more overworld interaction. Etc, etc. It is entirely possible that nothing will be there! But we have seen fairy minimal slices of the game thus far so passing decisive judgment (especially something like \"50% more cost for 50% less quality\" is premature and kinda doofy.",
            "I wasn\u2019t too bothered about the inability to transfer the game over at first, but as things have come out I started to turn. At this point I\u2019m pretty sure SWSH will be my last Pok\u00e9mon games, if I even buy it. I was forgiving of a lot, but it\u2019s hard to justify putting money into a franchise that seems determined to not evolve or improve. \n\nI know it\u2019s a kids game first and foremost, which is why I give them a lot of leeway, but Nintendo knows it has a dedicated fan base of older fans as well. It\u2019s crazy that they don\u2019t seem to take these games seriously.",
            "these fucking comments jesus christ. thank you for the writeup, idk what all this crap is about you being a shill. obviously a lot of of effort went into this post so i appreciate you taking the time to inform",
            "This is an incredibly detailed summary of what's been going on, kudos to the OP. As a diehard Pokemon fan, the most prominent thought out of all this is that social media is very poisonous. Never mind whose side is right, both end up spitting some serious vitriol that it's almost to a point where it's \"Damned if you do, damned if you don't.\" I'm thankful for this outrage because it has led me to successfully scaled back on my Twitter activity. I used to look at my timeline regularly, now that's a rarity. I only look at Twitter now for trends, and a very tiny number of people I follow. I've considered muting \"Pokemon\" but rather than let Twitter do the job of restriction, I've done it myself.\n\nIt also helps that I've been playing Pokemon ROMHacks nonstop, so my overall desire to play the new games is not that high, and I don't even have a Switch. I don't like what GF did, but I'm not for trashing them, going at their heads, bemoaning about other sins they committed in the past all of a sudden. People are free to do that, forcing me or others to get on this mentality, nah, not with that. \n\nI have considered un-subbing from r/Pokemon, but for one, I barely go there anyway, and two, the OC is so damn good. Not specifically any regarding this controversy, just general artistic expressions and whatnot.",

It has been ridiculously hard or complicated to get some of my favourite Pok\u00e9mon in recent games and I\u2019m not a fan of it.",
            "Other people have said this, but the wording in this post is far from neutral. I think OP acted in good faith judging from his comments, though. \n\nThe timing of this post is strange to me, too. Masuda made the statement a week ago, and this post would have been much more timely then. It\u2019s a little stale now, and doesn\u2019t really refer to any specific subreddit drama going on right now.\n\nr/Pokemon was been fuming for weeks, so are we just going to keep having these posts saying \u201cr/Pokemon is angry\u201d every week with the whole story so far?

God forbid, *8.5*?\n\n2) How do you know the game's bad? \n\nAlso, one more thing\n\n> Anti-anti-Dexiteers\n\nWhy are people for Dexit called anti-anti-Dexiteers? Isn't \"Dexit\" itself the support of removing the Pokemon? \n\nOh, you're an anti-anti-Trump supporter? Well, I'm an anti-anti-*anti*-Trump supporter.\n\nEDIT: \n\n> Many anti-Dexiteers believe that these Poketubers are attempting to drum up support for Sword and Shield, because the more interest there is in the franchise, the more money they will make on their videos.\n\nMotherfu-- it's POKEMON.

And probably, just like that community, they will not learn from it and just do it all over again if given half the chance.\n\nEDIT: Also, to quickly expand here, because I can add a bit of more info here:\n\n- Pokemon has pretty much reused all their code since generation 3 for item lists, move mechanics and so on. Nowhere is this more obvious than what occurs if you hack your game, where you can easily add key items from generation 3 to Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon. Yes they'll be effectively useless, but it's an indicator that as far as updating these goes, it's an additive task, not a recreating one. This even goes for the other game where they pulled this \"not programming in everything\" shit, LGPE.\n- The 3D models that exist are already being reused for LGPE. Exactly the same models, exactly the same poly counts, so on and so forth. These were even the same models that were used in X and Y, the game that debuted these models. To update them for the switch, all that is needed is to update (aka upscale) the textures for the screen of the Switch, which is a task that at best means leaving your computer running for a few days, since it can be fully automated.",

            "As a developer, the lack of knowledge about the development process and sense of entitlement among players is disappointing.

Then those 2 effects combine to create a thunderstorm powering both water and electric types. That just seems awesome, matching up different field conditions against giants.",
            "I am pro-smaller dex.\n\nAlso the whole \"I can do this in 24-hours, so the dev team excuse is blah, blah\" is really obnoxious.  Unless you are in their dev house, you shouldn't be saying shit about what those devs can or can't do.  It ain't up to them."

As CTV News has said recently, \"As the adage goes, when the U.S. sneezes, Canada catches a cold. \" Just a reminder of some of the issues we have had under Trump's reign of terror:\n\n* [The impulsive 10% aluminum tariffs and steel tariffs](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-its-not-me-its-you-trumps-aluminum-tariffs-are-a-byproduct-of-his/) which even [a lot of American's dont like](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/over-half-americans-oppose-trump-080004190.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAHQZteynUxZ_hOPYoUhxCwaN0dfKpc2IygH67hT1YEiUTZlWWC5Cw63eSNZXKX8EfR70Ayi4zxujBzQTr1F9TLTn_gNMwYRJaZ2j5lcPeI9TqwZNpvDxeojqCXfo-qGeLvYOfz5O-mu5QwQb7yk8HqC640HHtZ5GnSzDtvgGeKuJ)  which have also resulted in $3.6 billion in retaliatory tariffs for American products coming into Canada. Sadly, this isn't even the first time, he did it in 2018 too.\n\n* [The Tiktok banning which is being seen as a dangerous omen for Canadian social media companies](https://torontosun.com/opinion/columnists/globerman-trumps-tiktok-move-sends-clear-warning-to-canadian-companies)\n\n* The re-negotiation of the NAFTA deal in which Trump lied and said that Canada had been taking advantage of America for years. Then bipolar Trump would threaten to dismantle the deal or claim that Canada had shafted America again.\n\n* [Trump going back and forth on his opinion of Canada, calling our prime minister two-faced](https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/america-votes/what-have-trump-and-biden-said-about-canada-1.5038017) and other stupid things. It's like walking on egg shells with Trump's rants and ravings.\n\n* The complete disaster of the pandemic response by Trump and the Republicans. No, we are not opening up our border just because you want to post your troops here or threaten us. We like being alive thank you very much.\n\n* The feud between Canada and China thanks to [Trump's decision to request the extradition of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou in December of last year.](https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/chretien-blames-canada-china-feud-on-trump-s-trap-1.4738838\n) We paid the price for it \n\nThose are just the few I could think of off the top of my head. I know we like to joke around with the whole USA vs Canada thing, but as the [US Department of State (Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs) says in their Bilateral Relations Fact Sheet (2020)](https://www.state.gov/u-s-relations-with-canada/):\n\n>The United States and Canada share the world\u2019s longest international border, 5,525 miles with 120 land ports-of-entry, and our bilateral relationship is one of the closest and most extensive. It is reflected in the high volume of bilateral trade \u2013 nearly $2 billion a day in goods and services \u2013 and in people-to-people contact \u2013 about 400,000 people cross between the two countries every day. In fields ranging from border and national security to global affairs to the opioid crisis to environmental protection to free trade, our two countries work closely together on multiple levels, from local/provincial to federal.\n\nLet's return to our bilateral relationship that is close and extensive. Not this Canada-is-the-enemy thing America has going on right now.",

Chargebacks. Stolen credit cards. Review bombs. No reason at all! If you think you're safe, you're not.\n\nYou need to protect yourself.\n\n1. Have at least one other recovery email from something other than google. Protonmail is popular. You can also buy a domain through something like bluehost and then use that for email. \n\n2.

But then they should just ban subbredits like /r/piracy and give that as the reason. But this? This is basically gaslighting.\n\n\"Of course we had to ban you, you had lots of rule violations.

            "Why is 74 the magic number?\n\nIt's fine to enforce copyright claims, but they at least need to communicate what the infringing content is so that they can adapt and monitor for similar content - or at least have an avenue to dispute over frivolous claims. ",

Evidence suggests that that is a lie, as moderators have access to logs for deleted posts and they have found none. An alternative theory would be that they really have deleted these posts and then hidden the logs. There is just no way around it, somebody is lying and/or hiding evidence.\n\n* /r/Piracy moderator /u/dysgraphical says that it looks like Reddit is setting up a scenario that they can blame when they eventually ban /r/Piracy.

            "> The law also requires us to issue bans in cases of repeat infringement. Sometimes a repeat infringement problem is limited to just one user and we ban just that person. Other times the problem pervades a whole community and we ban the community.   \n\nWeasel words (although lawyer so obviously).   \n\nIt is true that the DMCA requires user bans for safer harbor protections. It isn't true that entire \"communities\" need to be banned, because the DMCA has no real concept of communities. \n\nIf they choose to ban the community that is their right, but let's not pretend it is required by the DMCA rather than an attempt to reduce Reddit legal's workload.   \n\n",

'Cause it seems like they don't grasp that you don't need to go into explicit detail.\n\nI've given it a little thought, and I feel like this would be appropriate. Like, if I were a teacher and a 4th grader asked me something along the lines of \"what does x mean?\", I couch it in LGBT+ terms and would write LGBT+ on the blackboard and state that a person that is X might feel like they belong with this group. There are many types of people in the group and it has a lot to do with who someone may choose to be a partner with, like their parents. And remind the kids that we need to get along with everyone, so please be nice to them and anyone else who might not be like them. We've all felt left out before and we didn't like it, so give everyone a chance, okay?\n\nIunno if that's good, neutral, or sucks, but I figured that suggesting someone might feel like they belong to avoid pigeonhole-ing or rigidly boxing groups together. That there are a lot of different type of people,  basically all shapes and colors, so they avoid thinking they can ID someone as LGBT+ visually. Put it in terms of a person who is X instead of \"an X person\" which makes it sound like being X is their entire personality when it obviously is just one facet. And tried to link that being mean to someone because they are X to an emotion they've felt before and didn't enjoy in hopes of nudging them towards, at the minimum, tolerance.  \n\nBut I'm not an educator nor a parent. But tried to think of something quickly as if I'd been put on the spot. And if my explanation doesn't wildly miss the mark, then there's not a reason we can't expose kids to some of life's \"issues\" and I say issue as in the people persecuting LGBT+ are making it an issue, not the people just, ya know, living life. But we can expose kids a little bit at a time so it's bite-size and easily digestible. And hopefully in the future, maybe even subconsciously, when they meet someone who doesn't make being LGBT+ a secret if asked, they'll remember at least part of what we'd talked about and just....not be an asshole and a bigot.\n\nI'm sure there are a lot of other topics people expose their kids to a little at a time to, and is the appropriate way to handle that situation.",

[Taken from an old comment of mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/4n2z47/spoilers_everything_anyone_else_reminded_of_lost/d40urez/).\n\n\\----\n\nThe ending only appealed to half the show's audience. Lost managed to keep two different groups happy for most of its run, and it's amazing that it almost got away with it to the end.\n\nThe first are the traditional Science Fiction fans, with crossover with the ideals of the Enlightenment and Secular Humanism. They care about all the intricate mysteries of The Island. When something strange happens, they want to pick it apart and see how it works.\n\nThe second group are Romance fans. I don't mean \"romance\" in the sense of stories about people falling madly in love (although it can include that), but rather as part of the 19th century literary tradition. It was something of a reaction to the perceived shortcomings of the Enlightenment after the bloodbath of the French Revolution. To a Romance fan, when something strange happens, it's accepted on its face. What matters is connections between characters, and how the Strange Happening affects their relationships.\n\nAll this fits well into the show's own themes of Faith vs Reason.\n\nThese are usually two groups that don't have much to do with each other, and sometimes outright hate each other. With Lost, the two groups were able to enjoy the same story more or less harmoniously. The ending tilted hard in favor of the Romance side of the audience, though, and the Science Fiction side felt like they got a raw deal.",

            "Watching Lost now fully for the first time, it's some weird ass masterpiece. The characters, the philosophy, the themes, and a sense of mystery tied to together is really compelling to watch 14 years later. Even with the ending spoiled for me, I get chills watching this show unfold. I don't get the interpretation that the island is some sort of purgatory, because the characters are interacting and actually dying and are in conflict with others who are also dying and never being seen again. It feels like it's leaning towards philosophical or mysticism logic than it is sci-fi or realism so far.",

There was a whole thing in the very last season where you did see the characters in what turned out to be some kind of afterlife, but nothing prior to the last season took place there. They went to a weird magical island for real in the real world and then there was also an afterlife when they died.

It's a very, very weird story about J\u00f3zio a 30-something old man abducted by Professor Pimko and forcefully inducted into a school where he is treated as a child. It's weird but has a message that one can't escape from \"the form\".\n\nSo this story reminds me specifically of M\u0142odziak family. At a certain point J\u00f3zio gets taken in by them and we learn that they are ultra modern, they say that they will let their daughter do whatever with whoever. This is \"the form\",  a mask they wear to seem modern. At the end J\u00f3zio manages to tear the mask off by getting Proffesor Pimko and their daughter's boyfriend into her room at night and drawing attention to it. The masks comes off, parents are angry not just at the fact that Zuta has two lovers at once but that one is old and the other young. J\u00f3zio escapes.\n\nSo what I'm getting at is that the Father in this story feels so much like M\u0142odziakowie - the whole modern, liberal etc deal.

We face the music and own what is a stain in our country.... like it or not the Confederacy was and always will be a huge part of American history, and despite what you believe many confederate soldiers thought themselves patriots against a tyrannical regime and the separation wasn\u2019t just warranted.... \n\nThis makes me kinda mad. Talking about Germany here. In Germany the word **Erinnerungskultur** (Culture of Remembrance) is basically a synonym for reminding, teaching and showing the atrocities that happened during the 20th century.  Erinnerungskultur is a huge part of the German mindset and gets big funds from the government and other independent organisations. A lot of Germans are proud of this reflective handling of the past they call it **Vergangenheitsbew\u00e4ltigung**. \n\nNow a lot of people don't get it, even some Germans. The point of this is **NOT** to make a society feel sorry for their past, but to be a constant reminder -to Germans **AND** the rest of the world- of what can happen if society's turn cruel. Imagine how easy it would have been for Germany to just mow down all those ugly concentration camps and be done with it. Instead they got transformed to public places of teaching, studying and remembrance. Another example of this are the so called [Stolpersteine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolperstein) you can find in every town.\n\nNow imagine any other country would have made it part of their collective spirit and patriotism to remember their atrocities of the past like the Germans do. Immagine the US government deliberately showing the rest of the world the horrors of an atom bomb, the horrors of the vietnam war of agent orange....etc. It took independent filmmakers to do that and then still the amount of cultural revisionism to justify this war crimes that takes place to this day is insane. \n\nBut but but, not being allowed to proudly fly the confederate flag at official government buildings is apparently hiding from the past, lol.",

Because it's symbols that represent war, suffering, pain and pretty much everything bad? Ah no I forgot it's because it's symbols that don't celebrate the supposed superiority of the white man.

He's being criticized for saying transphobic jokes and punching down on trans people. And those that defend him tooth and nail don't even want to understand why people are offended. They just wanna say that people didn't get the context. Here's the context. Dave used a dead trans person to excuse his transphobia. He literally pulled a \"I have black friend\". He called himself a terf, not even fully understanding the JK Rowling situation or that \\*gasp\\* black trans people exist. Instead he wants to play Oppression Olympics, pitting marginalized groups against each other.\n\nJokes like his are dangerous. If the past 4 years have taught me anything, its that joking about being ignorant towards a group of people who are oppressed, normalizes that ignorance. He has the freedom to say whatever he wants, no one is taking that away from him. But he should have responsibility in what he says cause whether you like it or not, jokes can and have had, consequences on how society views certain topics. If every right wing grifter and bigot is tweeting about how good his transphobia was, something is seriously wrong.\"\n\nBasically, what Dave did was awful and dangerous to how trans people are seen in society and makes me feel so bad for trans people who just can't be left alone and accepted.

            "People pretending Dave is a hack now is the natural progression of being okay with a comedian when he says x and it makes you laugh, but deciding he lost his touch the second he said something you personally find objectionable. It just goes to show that black pain is an acceptable form of comedy. Nobody gave a solitary fuck when he joked about R. Kelly abusing girls, and he wasn't just speaking truth to power. He was being a comedian and finding humour in something terrible. \n\nChappelle also isn't saying he's **being** canceled, he said people have tried to cancel him. That's objectively true, but ya'll pretending no one has called for Netflix to remove his specials and stop working with him. That is absolutely a call for cancellation. Here's a pro-tip: if your reaction to a comedian's set goes beyond \"He's a dick\", the next step isn't to say it's unacceptable for that act to be made available on a service, it's to move on. \n\nEdit: for the sake of discussion and to have my own taste in comedy dissected and/or shit on my three favourite comedians are Norm Macdonald, Dave, and Patrice O'Neal. Three fearless guys whose take on anything is hilarious. To them absolutely nothing was an obstacle to being funny. When that lady who was mauled by a chimp appeared on Oprah Patrice said her face looked like she had just opened a Lost Ark. That's absolutely punching down, but that's an hilarious improv to come up with 2 seconds notice.",

But if he makes a \u201cJoke\u201d about someone who\u2019s gay or trans he\u2019s the worst person ever?

            "His anger is with the fact that America is a country that has been struggling with race since it\u2019s inception. A country built on the back of slavery. A country that has been through the civil rights movement, Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, Black Lives Matter\u2026 and black Americans are STILL treated like second class citizens in many contexts. The black community still suffers measurably from generational inequality and systemic inequality.\n\nMeanwhile, the trans community has had incredible acceptance in recent years. Very suddenly it became taboo to question trans behaviour, misgender or dead-name someone. Public figures would face huge backlash for so much as questioning this new reality where gender is suddenly fluid and sex isn\u2019t determined by anatomy. \n\nIf you can\u2019t see why that would make a black man who cares passionately about racial equality angry, then you need to take your blinkers off. \n\nTo me it was crystal clear that Dave Chappelle does not have a problem with trans people, or gay people, or women. He is a man who is intimately familiar with the black community\u2019s fight for equality, and he does not like what he sees in how these other communities have approached the same problem - and the difference in expectations and outcomes for them.",
            "So when is someone going to link this srd thread in srd",
            "TL;DR IMO: He a bit confused but he got the spirit.\n\nAs a transperson, who watched all the specials and did their own research... he's not... Transphobic. He very clearly explains that he just has a unique view point because of his race. Which I get to some extent.\n\nHis claim that he's a TERF is both technically correct and technically incorrect. He's a TERF in that he believes Trans-Women shouldn't have the same rights/respect as Cis-Women. He's not a TERF in that he recognizes Transpeople are a prosecuted minority that deserve the same protections as racial minorities and homosexuals. He's not a TERF in that he still believes Transwomen are Women. He said that on his show. In his own words he \"gets\" that.\n\nMost of his \"TERF\"-ness is not differences in how he views existing law and how it should be reformed. But rather his cultural understanding and desires. And it's very easy for me and other Trans-People to argue that he doesn't get it. In terms of how he views trans culture, I genuinely believe he doesn't really 'get' us. And he doesn't really 'get' our place in the larger community by extension. And it's that's failure that is leading to all the hate. When he says we have his respect I believe him. But when he says he gets it... I keep thinking \"no he doesn't.\" And honestly? I don't think any amount of cyber bullying is going to help him get it, either.\n\nIn his most recent special he talked about a Trans-Woman he had a professional relationship with. It was... a pretty okay bit. He REALLY walked the line a few times, getting a little too close to phobia and mis-information. But he always either found a way to make it clear he didn't actually believe something and that it was a punch-line or clarify why he had to get so close and that what happened was true, a true story, a quoted line. I felt the comedian on stage was a little too brash and harsh. But that Dave Chapelle wasn't a transphobe or hater off stage.\n\nWe can ask him to stop making jokes about it but... he won't. That's what he does. He built a career out of making jokes about societal problems and communities no one else would even acknowledge. It's like asking a bear to stop being large and intimidating.\n\nThe trans-issue, what it means to be trans, why we're trans, and what to do about it... Is an extremely difficult topic any way. and, personally, I think expecting Cis-People to understand what it's like being trans is too big of an ask. We have his respect, he agrees with our legal agenda, and if he would stop spreading mis-information about our culture, there's not much more we could ask of a celebrity.\n\nAnd I think the concern the 'cancel' culture has, even is they haven't articulated it for them selves yet... Is they don't want Dave's show to unintentionally become and echo chamber for hate. Dave takes a \"blas\u00e9\" approach to the trans issue. That approach often leaves the door open for ill-intended fans to come along and \"turn\" the community or the Celeb. I think the Cancel Culture has misplaced the concern. Dave is black, not only studies, but lives racism, and knows how to shut things down before they become toxic.",
            "I mean\u2026. My wife and I laughed at the special. Our eyes also got pretty wide at some of the moments. I can understand it\u2019s a touchy subject.

So what I have noticed is that everything is halal according to you guys, and you follow a minority of scholars who declare everything halal. But what's the point of following Islam really if you are just going to break every single rules & restrictions of the religion? Why would you want to change the religion instead of changing your lifestyle?\n\n>For example, hijab. You guys say that hijab is not mandatory, a woman can show her hair, neck, etc. Like, why do you guys think that for 1400 years not a single scholar declared that women can show their hair? The only ikhtilaf was whether covering the face is mandatory or not, but hair or neck never came to question. Yet 1400 years later you suddenly declared that these are not mandatory to cover for women, she can show these! Like, what's the point of changing the rules which were never changed or even questioned for the last 1400 years? Why would you want to disobey Allah just because of this temporary worldly western lifestyle? Islam is complete submission, whether you like the rule or not, you have to submit, that's the message of Islam, no matter how hard it may seem.\n\n>I am a woman who wears the hijab. Do you think I like to wear the hijab? Every single moment I wish to take it off and feel the wind in my hair and neck. I'm going to be honest, I do not like wearing it at all, it is hot and suffocating. But do you know why I still keep wearing it? It's because I fear for the day of the judgement. I don't want to make Allah angry by exposing what he has forbidden me to do so, I don't want to be punished after my death. So I keep doing it, I keep sacrificing my worldly desires for the afterlife. Similarly, do you know how hard was it for me to get rid of music & drawing? I loved to draw as a kid, I drew a lot of animals. Those were my memories, & I still burned all of them. Because the satisfaction of Allah is more important for me. Do you have any idea how much I cried while burning and after burning my childhood drawings? But did I stop myself from destroying them? No. I also burned my deceased grandfathers old guitar that same day. That guitar had so much memories, but it didn\u2019t stop me from burning that instrument, because that is not allowed in our deen. I was feeling like someone was cutting my heart with a sharp knife into thousands pieces, while I watched them burn. I sacrificed so much for my faith, and here you guys are claiming that all of those are halal, Islam allows you to draw animals, play guitar, listen to music, expose your hair. Like, are you guys serious?\n\n>I sacrificed them, destroyed them for the sake of Allah, because I wanted to please Allah, I didn\u2019t want to anger him. I feel so angry when I see you guys claiming that everything is halal. What's the point of my sacrifice then? I destroyed those haram things for nothing? Is that what you want to mean?\n\n>& those scholars you bring up, they are extremely minority. You only follow them because their fatwas suit you. Do you know how much I cried almost every night after learning about the real Islamic rules from the scholars? Do you know how hard was it for me to make myself determined to destroy those objects which had so many memories attached? Every single scholar I went to said that those are haram, they showed me evidences from authentic hadiths, & convinced me to get rid of them no matter what; if I want to please Allah. And here you people found a few scholars who permits everything, going against the bulk of the Ummah, against the authentic hadiths! You think you are on the right path when the majority of the scholars are against these few scholars? You think all my sacrifices are in vein? Every single day I struggle with myself, but I prevent myself from all these temptations. I feel so angry and enraged when I see you people enjoying haram things, like you seriously believe that you can go to jannah so easily? & you don\u2019t need to sacrifice anything, you can do whatever you want (ie, listen to music) when so many other Muslims are struggling to get rid of them? And these extremely few scholars (I didn\u2019t even watch any of their videos or read any of their articles) are correct compared to the hundreds and thousands, if not millions of mainstream scholars?

Also, do we have such a limited and constrained view of what freedom is, that we think that having guns corresponds to freedom? What type of freedom? The freedom to kill if necessary? And also, if you're not allowed to have the good guns, then you're not really free.

On one end of the spectrum, you've got Chinese citizens who volunteer to narc on their neighbors to keep this virus in check, and on the other end you've got Americans who are willing to get themselves and others sick so they can drink tequila in Miami Beach. \n\nBoth approaches are fucked up, but for entirely different reasons, and with entirely different results during a pandemic.",

            "The original contents of this post have been overwritten by a script.\n\nAs you may be aware, reddit is implementing a punitive pricing scheme for its API starting in July.  This means that third-party apps that use the API can no longer afford to operate and are pretty much universally shutting down on July 1st.  This means the following:\n\n* Blind people who rely on accessibility features to use reddit will effectively be banned from reddit, as reddit has shown absolutely no commitment or ability to actually make their site or official app accessible.\n* Moderators will no longer have access to moderation tools that they need to remove spam, bots, reposts, and more dangerous content such as Nazi and extremist rhetoric.  The admins have never shown any interest in removing extremist rhetoric from reddit, they only act when the media reports on something, and lately the media has had far more pressing things than reddit to focus on.  The admin's preferred way of dealing with Nazis is simply to \"quarantine\" their communities and allow them to fester on reddit, building a larger and larger community centered on extremism.\n* LGBTQ communities and other communities vulnerable to reddit's extremist groups are also being forced off of the platform due to the moderators of those communities being unable to continue guaranteeing a safe environment for their subscribers.\n\nMany users and moderators have expressed their concerns to the reddit admins, and have joined protests to encourage reddit to reverse the API pricing decisions.  Reddit has responded to this by removing moderators, banning users, and strong-arming moderators into stopping the protests, rather than negotiating in good faith.  Reddit does not care about its actual users, only its bottom line.\n\nLest you think that the increased API prices are actually a good thing, because they will stop AI bots like ChatGPT from harvesting reddit data for their models, let me assure you that it will do no such thing.  Any content that can be viewed in a browser without logging into a site can be easily scraped by bots, regardless of whether or not an API is even available to access that content.  There is nothing reddit can do about ChatGPT and its ilk harvesting reddit data, except to hide all data behind a login prompt.\n\nRegardless of who wins the mods-versus-admins protest war, there is something that every individual reddit user can do to make sure reddit loses: remove your content.  Use [PowerDeleteSuite](https://github.com/j0be/PowerDeleteSuite) to overwrite all of your comments, just as I have done here.  This is a browser script and not a third-party app, so it is unaffected by the API changes; as long as you can manually edit your posts and comments in a browser, PowerDeleteSuite can do the same.  This will also have the additional beneficial effect of making your content unavailable to bots like ChatGPT, and to make any use of reddit in this way significantly less useful for those bots.\n\nIf you think this post or comment originally contained some valuable information that you would like to know, feel free to contact me on another platform about it:\n\n* kestrellyn at ModTheSims\n* kestrellyn on Discord\n* paradoxcase on Tumblr",

There was good discussion, a lot of helping out new guys, and several of us were always on the lookout for the suicide questioners. I talked to the mods several times about it when these would come up, and have spent hours DMing the suicidal OPs, just trying to maybe save someone's life. There was many others who would do so as well.\n\nAnd then the reddit purge happened. Once they shut down thedonald, shit went down hill. All those shills came to that sub because they figured their backwards opinions would be accepted, you know, if you like guns you have to be a hard right winger. \n\nDonald is a real fucking loser on the second amendment, along with the republican party, and you should see how butt hurt those sore fucks get when you actively call them out. I posted a meme about a year ago, calling trump a gun grabber and it went over 500 upvotes in a day. I posted it again after I saw the shit flinging gremlins take over and there was nothing but insults and it hardly went over a 100 upvotes. (Edited to add that I checked mentioned posts, and they've since changed. Before any of you anal fact checkers want to call me out on it)\n\nReddit fucked that sub, plain and simple, and reddit never liked them anyway. I hardly visit that sub anymore, and I now stick to r/guns. Even though the fuckin mods are pedantic mouth breathers, except for one who isn't well liked either. \n\nTl;dr: reddits donald purge pushed \"tread harder daddy\" crowds into that sub and it's now a gross misrepresentation of gun owners"

See stickied post for link.\n\nSo, it appears that someone has taken it upon themselves to \"take down\" pussypassdenied, as they consider it to be a hate sub. The method via which they want to go about doing this? Doxxing and Extortion of course!\n\nThe moderation team appears to have been threatened en mass with having their account activity leaked to folks in their real life unless control of the subreddit was handed over to the doxxer(s) in question so the place could be shut down. \n\nWell, it looks like they weren't just making shit up, [as the head mod Mustaka was pulled into the office and fired over this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/pussypassdenied/comments/5rzlpx/update_to_the_doxing_situation/ddch523/) \n\nHis initial reaction appears to be one of defeat, stating:\n\n&gt; Yeah I am out. **Going to hand the sub across to these people.** I fucking love the work the other mods have done. Stand by.\n\nGranted, that was two days ago and it has yet to happen. \n\nNeedless to say, this has prompted some drama.\n\n____________\n\n[One user had this to say:](https://np.reddit.com/r/pussypassdenied/comments/5rzlpx/update_to_the_doxing_situation/ddbn74x/)\n\n&gt; Remember people.... Your online accounts are not you. They are just character you've created for w/e purpose. They are a parody, a fictitious creation of yours. They do not represent the feelings or opinions of any real world entity. And that's all you have to say. Also remember that being removed from a job, fired, etc... for something a fictitious character said or did is grounds for a discrimination lawsuit. It's also illegal to be fired for it because it's not company property and you don't represent w/e company you work for. Get a lawyer immediately.\n\n[This prompted a post in /r/badlegaladvice](https://np.reddit.com/r/badlegaladvice/comments/5skpmi/they_are_a_parody_a_fictitious_creation_of/) outlining how, no, \n\n&gt; Being the moderator of a controversial subreddit is not a protected class, and that dismissal is not grounds for a discrimination suit\"  \n\n and   \n&gt; \"Claiming that something you wrote is a fictional parody is not \"all you have to say\" to avoid any negative repercussions.\"\n\n_____\n\nOthers suggested that [fighting fire with fire](https://www.reddit.com/r/pussypassdenied/comments/5rzlpx/update_to_the_doxing_situation/ddfka3h/) would be the way to go:\n\n&gt; Let's dox whoever did it. If the admins don't give a shit about doxxing, it should be fine.\n\n______\n\nAnother user was confused about how exactly someone ends up getting doxxed, [which prompted a doxxer to chime in](https://np.reddit.com/r/pussypassdenied/comments/5rzlpx/update_to_the_doxing_situation/ddf3icf/?context=1) with a handy combination of how-to guide and doxxing avoidance advice:\n\n&gt; Hello, I am a doxer. I have doxed multiple people, and I like to do things like send Qurans to their employer under their name and send them pizza during live streaming - always the best when their mom comes into their room to ask if they ordered a pizza while they're in the middle of a game.\n\netc. \n\n____ \n\nOverall [the full thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/pussypassdenied/comments/5rzlpx/update_to_the_doxing_situation/) is full of drama all over the place.\n\n[There's also a post where the fact that the mods were being doxxed was originally announced](https://np.reddit.com/r/pussypassdenied/comments/5r6xw3/mods_being_doxxed/); although that post was removed, the comments remain. \n\n______\n\n## Update: The DRAMA is Spreading!\n\nSomeone over at /r/KotakuInAction noticed as well, [and suffice it to say they're outraged.](https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/5sle7u/pussy_pass_denied_mods_are_being_threatened_with/)\n\nSome tidbits:\n\n&gt; [And once again, the admin's darling SJW powermod cabal break rules left and right, with a defaning silence from admins.](https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/5sle7u/pussy_pass_denied_mods_are_being_threatened_with/ddfxu7l/)  \nThis despicable and dangerous attack is far, far worse than any sub was guilty of, that have recieved politically motivated bans or quarantines.  \nThe admins staying silent equates to patent approval of such blatant rule violations, showing yet again that they haven't a shred of integrity between them.\n\n_____ \n\n[Interesting.

            "While this certainly does not account for everyone, and most likely not this particular person, it's a bad idea to paint those who take issue with phrases like \"thoughts and prayers\" with a broad brush. Particularly with regard to tragedies and violent acts, at least in the US, \"thoughts and prayers\", \"praying for the families\" etc is often employed by the people with the power to make a difference in that situation seemingly as an alternative to actually doing anything to help. Almost worse is that for some people it does actually make them feel like something has been done when in reality nothing has, letting those in power off the hook for doing their jobs. It's worse than just saying \"my condolences\" because there's a large segment of the population (I'm not saying this is all religious people because it's not) that equates someone saying \"prayers\" with *actually helping* and then feel like the people saying it are on their side when in reality they are anything but. This *does not mean* that we should let people get away with deliberately stirring the pot and and being assholes, but we really shouldn't wander down this road of assuming everyone taking issue with these sorts of cliched lines is doing it because they're an immature edgelord atheist. Because if you're like me, an atheist who sees the problem of religion to be not the people or the practices but those who use religious language and cultlike tactics to manipulate or even weaponize people against each other, then hearing phrases like \"thoughts and prayers\" coming from someone with shit for values and ulterior motives and knowing people you care about are hearing that and thinking \"this person cares about *me*, thinks like *me*, and should be trusted\" really stings. I'm seeing a lot of people here saying things to the effect of \"what's wrong with saying you're praying for someone?\" without taking the time to think about why in some cases it *is* a problem and why it provokes such harsh responses from those who've been hurt by those who weaponize religious language but haven't yet matured enough in their beliefs to realize what's truly causing them pain. I used to think like that, and if I'd been active online and seen a lot of the seemingly innocuous reactions I've read here, I might've taken a far different path than I did. For those who've been hurt by religious people and organizations, realizing that it's not the religion itself that's the problem can take a very long time. Grouping these people in with bad actors like the one in that thread is just going to create more people like that and make our discourse around religion more and more toxic.",

He lifted his 400 pound frame off his bed wondering how many women he\u2019d be able to harass on Xbox Live today when just then he remembered: today was the day. Today was the day he would finally get a chance to debate Christian sheep and slay their god in heaven. Excitedly, he got on his disability scooter and then into his 2007 Toyota Corolla. He drove to the hospital, scoffing every time he saw a crucifix bumper sticker and made sure to situate his fedora before he got out, parking in between two disability slots. When he entered, he got his camera ready, and going up to the third floor he thought \u201cReddit, the last enlightened place on Earth, will finally give me the attention I deserve and recognize me for my intelligence.\u201d He entered into the room where his grandmother was lying and drawing her last breaths. A priest was standing next to her along with her children and grandchildren, anointing her and hearing her last confessions. \u201cThis is it,\u201d he thought, \u201cthis is where I own those religiotards and achieve victory for atheism.\u201d He boldly walked right next to his grandmother\u2019s side and just as the priest said \u201cmay God bless your soul,\u201d he bravely rebutted with \u201cbut there is no god to meet you in heaven. None of it is real. Your sky daddy won\u2019t save you this time.\u201d His grandmother looked on him in shock, opening her mouth. But then she slouched and a long beep was heard and her mouth remained wide open. \u201cYet another victory for atheism,\u201d he said, looking at his family members who were stricken with faces of horror. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ve finally realized their God is dead.\u201d He opened Reddit, excited by the prospect of the karma he was going to get by posting the video he took on r/atheism.",

Discussion ensues, but the r/legaladvice mods have yet to respond.\n\n*EDIT: After the post in r/badlegaladvice was made, and shortly after this post was made, the mod was relieved of their duties, however no official comment from the mods on the removal as of yet.

I\u2019m a financial advisor, and cannot count how many times I\u2019ve been downvoted to oblivion on finance subs for correcting very serious misinformation.

There\u2019s this growing fad, however, where people would rather trust the advice of a stranger on the internet than a professional that is legally required to have their best interests at heart. \n\nI get that sometimes you feel like you\u2019re being sold to when you\u2019re talking to a financial advisor, doctor, lawyer, etc. but even if that were the case (which it isn\u2019t), the alternative is much much worse. If you wouldn\u2019t let Timmy next door operate on you, draft your will, pick your investments for your IRA/401k, or give you tips on your love life while you\u2019re talking face to face, don\u2019t trust him either just because he\u2019s hiding behind the username /u/supersmartlawtalkingman",

Like maybe Kristen Bell is actually dropping out of her random animated voice role so she doesn't lose her more viable corporate sponsorships on advertisements or other roles. Maybe she's doing it for the publicity bump? \n\nBut does it really matter if it has a good effect and might inspire other casting directors to follow suit? Literally any politically correct action or good deed can be done for public perception... but pointing out the small race-related ones makes it seem like the worry about \"true intentions\" is really about something else.",
            "So deciding to drop a job is virtue signaling too these days?

            "I mean good for them but I find it a bit weird to advocate this for voice work. I mean I get trying to promote more diversity in hiring and there absolutely should be more but simply going \"if the complexion fit then so does the voice\" is kinda the wrong approach IMO. It's the easiest and most simple one but I feel like it's misplaced in voice work. I mean Christopher Judge has been a god send for the new Kratos and I honestly couldn't imagine anyone else doing the voice. Literally. He's the fuckin guy! But to think he shouldn't take the role cause he isn't greek would be ridiculous.",

While I applaud them doing what they felt was right, I also think voice acting is an entirely different animal and that racial alignment shouldn\u2019t matter here; it\u2019s just a voice, and the role should go to whomever brings the most life to the character.

I took the time to record the TMNT credits and saw that yes, James Avery was listed and later verified he was the voice of the Shredder.\n\nI thought this was really cool. Still do. I'm not pissed that they didn't have a Japanese or Japanese American guy doing the voice of the Shredder. It was what it was, and James Avery brought some great talent to the original Shredder.\n\nThat's just me.",

            "I'm as #woke as I can be. But this is wholly unnecessary. The entire point of Voice Acting is that race/appearance/whatever doesn't matter. In Central Park an old white woman is voiced by a black man, and she's one of my favorite characters. \n\nKristen Bell is admirable for thinking she should do this, but she absolutely shouldn't. Her singing voice is amazing, and brought  so much to the role. (I can't speak to Big Mouth as I've never watched it.)\n\nEDIT: You can downvote me all you want, but this literally happens and has happened throughout the history of the art. Phil Lamar as Samurai Jack (A Japanese man), Terrence C. Carter as Kratos (A Greek man) David Oyelowo as Agent Kallus from Star Wars Rebels (a European-coded man) it's obviously a problem when people are doing purposely offensive harmful stereotype voices, but when it's just someone doing a respectful interpretation of a character I just can not see the problem.\n\n**EDITx2:** This Edit's more important than the last one. So, I've had a few insightful conversations and I must say that I'm wrong. Here's why: \n\nI wasn't seeing that the problem stems from a lack of opportunities that white actors/actresses voicing PoC. Does it really matter in terms of execution of the role? No, and that's what I was fixating to. However, when Hollywood is so full of established white actors/actresses anyway, why can't we provide opportunities to PoC actors who routinely have a much harder time breaking through into the industry and have had the same problems for decades.\n\nI'm leaving the comment up as opposed to deleting it, because I'm confident that others had the same hang ups as me and it'd be good for them to see the same thought process that I was introduced to. It's really important to admit when you're wrong! You're allowed to be wrong! What's super important is what comes after you realize that you're wrong.",

I don\u2019t know about big mouth, but Central Park has numerous POC voice actors on the show. In fact, Daveed Diggs, a mixed black man, plays the role of an old white woman. I get where Kristen Bell is coming from, but the show does have a pretty diverse cast.",
            "i'd be against the whole idea of caring about what race is behind the voices, as long as they're able to carry the character, its all good.  However, this was a personal choice on those voice actors, so can't really dislike the move."

            "There's something I feel is being lost in this discussion about tipping, and that's how people devalue the work that waiters and delivery drivers do. There's a massive undercurrent of contempt for the people who work these jobs. Some of the worst tippers also tend to be people who think waiting tables or delivering food isn't \"real work\" worth paying someone for, because \"any idiot can do it.\" That's at least a part of the reason why people hate having to tip, or don't tip well, and also why companies don't bother paying their service workers a decent (not minimum) wage. \n\nSociety in general struggles with the idea that service workers do work that deserves a far greater compensation than what they get. Whether that's through tipping, or through a paid wage from the company is beside the point. People in those jobs not only deserve better wages and treatment from their companies, but they deserve a lot more respect. \n\nI think there's a lot of validity to the fact that companies offload their responsibilities in terms of wages to the customer. But I'm also not going to stop tipping or tip poorly because of that. Companies don't give a shit about their workers. If they're not already paying them, they're not going to start doing that because the customers stop tipping. The only people who get hurt are the service workers at the end of the day. The best way to help hold companies accountable is to empower the people in those jobs and help them advocate for themselves. If they're dealing with a lot of financial precariousness, they're far less likely to speak up against abuses for fear of losing what little they're getting. I probably tip more than I should, but I also don't eat out if there's ever an instance where I can't afford to give that tip either. That's just me though.",
            "As a European this is surreal that people are stirring up a fuss over this.\n\nDrivers never get tips here unless you\u2019re wealthy or the delivery driver does something very impressive, like covering a large distance in 10 minutes.\n\nOther than that they get paid what they get paid.",
            "Ahhhh!!! I just give my DD drivers cash! I probably look like a massive asshole now if all the drivers see I don\u2019t leave a tip through the app. I\u2019m always suspect of companies not giving a driver 100% of the money.",

            "Driving picking orders based on tips is\nGonna be the downfall of this service",
            "Man this guy complains that they ring his doorbell when he has an instruction not to ring the doorbell but I feel like I have the opposite problem. I have \"ring doorbell\" twice because I can't hear the door sometimes unless you really pound on the door, but a lot of drivers don't ring it and knock. I typically have the DoorDash tracker pulled up and there has been several times where I hear nothing and then the tracker updates to \"Delivered\" and I walk out and see food sitting on the ground. No big deal, though.\n\nThe only times I've been mad about a Dasher during a delivery is when my food was delivered to the wrong apartment even after I came out on the balcony to direct her to my apartment. I pointed at the door she needed to go in and up and everything. My instructions even say \"I will point you to *the door you need to go in to get to my apartment*.\" She left the food at the apartment door before the door she needed to go in. My balcony is on the *opposite side* of the door that she left it at. I could not wrap my mind around that one at all. In order for that apartment to have been my door, I would have had to have a penthouse that spans two separate buildings and I would have had not one or two balconies, but three separate balconies.\n\nThe other time I was mad is when they delivered to the wrong apartment, sent me a text message and said \"Enjoy the food!\", and I sent a message back after there wasn't any food at my door saying, \"Oh hey, you delivered to X instead of Y!\" and they texted back and said, \"Oh well you can go get it.\" This was back before COVID-19 and I always put in my instructions that if I don't answer to text me because it could be the wrong apartment.\n\nI have a super hard to find apartment for 99% of drivers so I always leave like a paragraph of instructions. All my deliveries used to go to a completely different apartment (even UPS/FedEx/Amazon deliveries). I was finally able to convince the landlady to get numbers on every single door in the entire complex and my mis-deliveries have dropped to like 1% since.\n\nAs for tipping, before DoorDash switched to its new system, I did not tip because DoorDash would pay the Dasher. I think it was like if you didn't tip then DoorDash paid $3, but if you tipped $1, DoorDash paid $2. And if you tipped $3 or more, DoorDash didn't pay anything. So you were basically tipping DoorDash. But now I tip whatever the recommended amount is set by DoorDash per order.",
            "So being a partner with both postmates and uber eats i get tipped about 70 percent of the time and thats with following instructions i call and or wait in the car if asked to i dont knock or ring a bell if its late but on the other hand i only wait the 7 mins required of me to wait i also have a body cam that i turn on for every pick up and drop off because i also have been given 1 star for allegedly not delivering food lol not possible when i have video and gps proof even better when they say the food is missing items as i account for every item on camera or have the resturant verify the items in the sealed bag i also provided a cooler to keep drinks cold and a warmer to keep meals hot granted i spent about $230.00 when i started 2 yrs ago for the bod cam and cooler heater ect but in the end i protect my self from people mentioned above who want to take money out of my kids schooling clothing supplys ect \n\nMy point to all this is no matter how good of a job you do some people wont tip simply because they cant afford the extra money and really have no way to the pizza shop ect while others are miserable and want you to be to with them protect your job and move foward they wont be the last one you will encounter",

Don't get me wrong, Fox News and Tucker Carlson are right wing grifters and have largely been Trump's lickspittles for the past 4 years, but OANN and Newsmax are different animals altogether. It's honestly concerning to see these media outlets worshipping, for lack of a better word, Trump and outright fabricating insane news stories. The US military storming a German server company would be tantamount to an outright declaration of war.\n\nFor the \"facts don't care about your feelings\" crowd, they sure try hard to fabricate facts to validate their feelings.\n\nEdit: Correction. While it was claimed by OANN that the raid was in Germany, the company Scytl has *no offices* in Germany and is instead based in Spain. OANN (as well as Trump) has also claimed Scytl's competitor, Dominion, based here in Toronto is implicated in mass fraud, of course without any evidence. I can't wait until the American military \"storms my city to save Trump\". OANN claims Dominion deleted approximately 2.5 million votes in favour of Trump, of course citing no evidence.

They start from \"Biden having cheated is FACT\" and \"the Hunter Biden story is FACT\" and you work you way back from there, and if reality contradicts any of it then it's reality that's wrong. That also means that asking for evidence for these FACTS is betrayal since it doesn't even make sense to ask for it anyway since it's FACT so clearly they already have evidence since otherwise they wouldn't be FACTS but they totally are FACTS because we know they are, despite the evidence we really shouldn't need to ask about, since asking for it would prove that we think that they are not FACTS even though we already know that they totally are FACTS.\n\nI wish I could just point and laugh at the stupidity but I'm genuinely worried for our democracies.

You want to attach your own oxygen mask before helping others.\n\nHowever, it ignores people who can't get their lives together because of debt, poverty, systemic inequality, lack of access to healthcare or education, a lack of good jobs, lack of social safety nets, etc. I have relatives who cannot get jobs lest they lose the welfare benefits that they rely on to survive and end up with less money than they had before. Poverty is a trap that prevents people from escaping in so many ways. They would LOVE to get off welfare but it would mean putting themselves in EVEN more poverty. That's not them being lazy and not having their lives together. It's them being trapped in a flawed system which they have EVERY RIGHT to criticize since they are victims of it.\n\nThe people who can get their lives in order and pull themselves up by their bootstraps are generally people who already have a measure of privilege and security. They just need to clean their rooms and hit the gym more often. That advice DOES work for incel-types whose lives would probably get better if they stopped blaming society for their issues and instead worked on bettering themselves. But it's not one-size-fits-all advice.\n\nThe whole \"fix your life before you criticize society\" argument is so flawed.

            "So I actually listened to the whole 3 hr video while working today. It\u2019s a good video if you have the patience for it, I didn\u2019t know much about Jordan Peterson beyond him being a pseudo intellectual right wing grifter that loads of people seem to adore.\n\nBy the end of the video I felt bad for the guy. He seems genuinely sick, mentally unstable even. \n\nTo very briefly summarize. Jordan Peterson is a self help guru type psychologist. He was a professor for many years on the subject of psychology. He is and was known for being a great motivational speaker, but very often he will say something as if it is a fact, when it is strictly subjective, or sometimes just some basically made up statistic that isn\u2019t supported by anything.\n\nHe believes that dreams are some sort of metaphysical conduit type thing, and that he and his wife are almost prophetic. This seems to be a big part as to why everything has to be made to fit within his world view.\n\nThat world view is essentially- hierarchies, inequalities, and disparity are hard wired into every living organism. It is natural for very few to hold most of the influence, while the majority hold significantly less. The world is all based on the disparity between order and chaos\n\nAnd everything essentially fits into that, he thinks the capitalist systems we have in place are the natural way of things, they do not need fixed, nor should we even attempt to fix them. Hell, his solution to climate change is essentially just \u201cno.\u201d\n\nI feel sorry for him since he genuinely seems sick. He has all these delusions and superstitions that influence his way of thinking, only boosted by his follower base online. He\u2019s a perfect example of someone who might well be an intelligent man, falling into a decades long spiral of conspiracy and nonsensical lunacy.",
            "I've been aware of the stinky lobster man, but after watching that Quick Bite of a video, I'm pretty shocked that this man gets to speak in public. The shit he says is so wildly incoherent.\n\nI've heard many a conservative argue against gay rights and gay families. None of them are compelling arguments obviously but they are least flow logically from one sentence to another. Jorbson's argument that studies show two parent households have better outcomes than one parent households and um also the more father's are around, the better the community does is just shocking. For one thing, he's arguing that the ideal community is entirely married gay men.\n\nAnd it's all like that. Capitalism is bad? Oh you silly leftist. Lobsters go like YEEAH when you give them seratonin. Just like a man taking antidepressants?? So. I mean I can leave it there, the conclusion is obvious.\n\nIt's like anyone else in the fox news/Prager utube ecosystem. I literally can't imagine being so passive and unscrutinizing that anything they say is even plausible. But if you're go to comeback is you criticize capitalism, yet sell ads to pay rent, you're probably outsourcing most of your thinking.",

            "I remember seeing the post by OP and I find the claim it\u2019s male to be quite interesting.\n\nGendered writing styles are a thing. Both writing and reading. I used [this](http://www.hackerfactor.com/GenderGuesser.php#Analyze) which is based on a peer reviewed approach to guessing the gender of writing. It differentiates between informal and formal writing. This was a strong female for the informal, but male if it were formal. In this context the informal result makes more sense. Her followup post also says she it is female.\n\nWhat is interesting however is that it typically only gives a strong result if a person is American. This is because the word weights are based on American English. So this person is probably American, or has something which results in her speaking like an American (like growing up in a US boarding school).\n\nNote that this shouldn\u2019t be taken as an indicator that the person is or isn\u2019t female. I just thought the concept of testing their comment to be interesting. Random chance would be 50% accurate, and the paper is only around 70% accurate. So 3 out of 10 tests will the wrong.\n\nThat said I once had a racist American admit to me he pretends to be British in order to post racist content to a particular UK subreddit.

I'd still say this story is likely to be fake.\n\nBecause how can *you* possibly be about to marry someone and not know about the cultural background of *their* family? The OP claims to be a fun, worldly person... who apparently has never once asked what the background of their partner actually was?\n\nI can fully accept the partner not talking about it much, because they're not sure yet whether they want to follow the expected cultural background too, or they don't want to cause conflict with a family they want to keep close;  but even if you're being hidden from their family, you can still work out there's something serious there, simply from the hiding itself.\n\nLikewise the family, if they really value what ever it is they value, aren't going to wait until marriage is only days away to meet the person marrying in to their family to make it clear what they expect; indeed the more patriarchal and controlling, the more it's the family that knows more about the potential bride than the groom, because they're the ones who will have done all the work in selecting her, not him.\n\nAnd if they're really, *really* that authoritarian, they won't be looking outside of the community at all. \n\nBut we're supposed to believe their son shares their values enough to supposedly want to expose her cervix to his cult, but didn't think it was worth telling her this was what was expected of her until 2 days before?\n\nNow having dated someone trapped in that kind of world, I can *sort of* see how someone in that situation, personally conflicted, might justify to themselves that they can work up to bringing someone from the outside in. \n\nBut then that tends to reveal what you're actually doing long before you get towards marriage. In our case, it was a romantic text meant for me that got accidentally sent to her uncle that revealed she was dating.  Oh, I know dedicated liars can get away with leading double lives... but the OP wants us to believe they were honestly in love, having a great time together... but no one noticed?\n\nAnd the less said about \"All the men get to look at my vagina\" the better.\n\nThe OP honestly reads just as an immature, possibly shit-stirring or just outright racist caricature of what they think cross cultural issues can be. And I wouldn't be entirely surprised to see the other post was actually them too, that they were so excited by their supposed trolling they didn't look closely enough and posted it on the wrong one...\n\n... one things for sure though, they've never genuinely dated an actual woman, much less one across cultures, if they think they just go and \"eat pizza\" without any kind of trauma afterwards.

            "It's really telling of how entrenched social structures are - the idea that hitting kids is good for child rearing - that many people vehemently believe in them despite literally all the science saying that *at best* it's ineffective, and more often it's harmful.\n\nI can understand why people get really defensive of it. I was hit as a kid (and locked in a boiler room... It's crazy how I remember very little from my childhood but I remember what that room smelled like) - it has had a bad effect on me and my relationship with my father. So I don't want to be this \"damaged\" person, though I don't think any of us get through life without some issues, it'd be a lot easier to deny that part of my life that hurt me and affects my social abilities. \n\nOr, of course, if I hit kids... It'd be easier to tell myself it wasn't that bad. Well - I did hit my younger sibling. Kinda \"passed it along\" at a young age, I don't like that I did. \n\nBut that's the thing. It did happen, it was bad, and if I don't reconcile that and learn from it I could just repeat it. And I don't want that for anyone.\n\nThe crazy thing is too that - while I remember the abuse - I don't remember *why* I got it.\n\nConversely, there was a time where I was stealing money from my mom - I was like maybe eight. I didn't know how bad it was, it was just something we could use to go bowling that she kept from us. And I wanted to be able to bowl more haha.\n\nShe obviously found out and put two and two together when I offered to pay to go bowling after she told me that it was too expensive. I was sat down, told I can't do that and why it's wrong, and I think I wasn't allowed to use the computer for a week or so? Can't remember exactly, but I didn't do it again. I actually remember why it was wrong. \n\nAnd that's the crazy thing, discipline isn't all that intuitive. But our stupid animal brains don't learn the \"right\" thing through corporal punishment. We learn what happens when we get caught. We learn that we cannot trust this individual. We learn that violence is an appropriate response to a lie or some other bad act.\n\nWe need to be better y'all. This can't last.",

            "For anyone here on the fence, here\u2019s something personal and horrible: I was \u201conly\u201d spanked on the bottom, often just in underwear. At the age of 5-6, I was groomed and molested. It got worse over time. Because I was hurt on the bottom by an adult, I thought this was okay and I was just a bad child who deserved it and if my parents knew, they\u2019d hurt me too. \n\nI didn\u2019t tell my parents I was being hurt and inappropriately touched by a family friend because of spanking. Think about it, just for a minute, and how a sheltered kid might come to the conclusion that \u201cbad = spank, spank = hurt bottom, abuse = hurt bottom, so bad = abuse\u201d. I still counted time using cartoon episodes, okay? When I was told it was just a game or a punishment or a special way to show love, that my parents either knew of if they knew, they\u2019d punish me, etc., all the standard manipulation, I went along with it. I was scared of my parents hurting me. If I hadn\u2019t been afraid of my parents hurting me, and especially hurting me near my genitals, I\u2019m pretty sure I would have told them or a trusted adult. \n\nBecause of this, I would never purposefully pay a hand on a kid. Grab them too hard to prevent them touching a hot thing or running into traffic? Sure, by accident. But I\u2019d never spank them, slap them, etc. I personally know it increases the likelihood of molestation and I think it\u2019s unethical to do anything that would increase the risk of that. If my words have meant anything, please consider the impact you\u2019re having. There\u2019s a reason adults sexualize spanking. You shouldn\u2019t be hitting your kids regardless but the sexual aspect can\u2019t be overlooked.",

I'm not allowed to look stuff up about this trial (or really have any connection with the Internet, but nobody actually follows sequestering rules anyway). Hence I am obviously posting anonymously. I accidentally wandered into here a few days ago from the r/SubredditDrama thread on my main reddit account. Here is my opinion on the trial:  \n>  \n>First off, I think it's pretty obvious due to chain of custody that the defendant is in fact Mr. Brooks and he did do it. HOWEVER, I've had throughout this trial doubts about various aspects of this case:  \n>  \n>The judge is clearly biased against Mr. Brooks. I got that feeling from when we were in the room and my eyes have been opened to how she acted towards him when the jury was out of the room. Clearly she is not an impartial judge and has been trying to belittle, demean, bully and pull procedural tricks on him fairly frequently. I had my doubts already, but the subreddit has shown it to me clearly.  \n>  \n>Mr. Brooks has clearly not been given the chance to plead his case in court. He has been silenced and mocked at almost every turn. While he may be a bit loud or crass at times, I still believe his side deserves to be heard.  \n>  \n>I do have significant doubts about subject matter jurisdiction. I didn't understand it when discussed in court because the defendant was repeatedly silenced. But I do understand now thanks to this sub and I agree that subject matter jurisdiction is a great concern here.  \n>  \n>This subreddit has made me aware of jury nullification and I am very grateful for that.  \n>  \n>Overall, I'm not sure what I will decide. I'm not educated in law and I have to admit I'm biased against the defendant for the horrible acts he did. However, it is also clear that this trial is a complete kangaroo court. Mr. Brooks has not been allowed to try and prove his innocence, subject matter jurisdiction or explain the circumstances surrounding the events. (It's hard to imagine what could justify it but we just can't know because of this trial). For these reasons, I'm torn between locking him up and throwing away the key or jury nullification. Both have arguments for and against them and I'm not looking forward to choosing. I'm mostly writing this to help myself process my thoughts on this but please let me know what you think.",

It's pointless. Those guys are weird, and often oddly aggressive with their choice of what to hoard.\n\nBasically if there's some data that you really value and want to make sure that it's never irrecoverably lost, your best bet is to leave it on some public place online while loudly saying \"oh boy I sure hope nobody is going to archive this, I really don't want them to do that\" and you can be sure that a dozen or so neckbeards are going to store it on their RAID-83 10PB SAN in their basement.",

Saw a couple people talking about how the videos helped them through a hard time, which y\u2019know I understand because i know that exact feeling, but it wasn\u2019t the videos themselves, it\u2019s Mark and Ethan themselves helping them through a hard time, and you can watch them on their main channels. They\u2019re not gonna stop being friends.\n\nI more feel bad for everyone who worked their ass off for it. If I worked my ass off for something, only to have it deleted, I would be kind of salty...then again, the editors and everyone who helped knew what was happening so they did it willingly. It\u2019s a mixed thing for me. It sucks not being able to see those videos again and not being able to see the videos I\u2019ve missed because I\u2019m a busy person, but it\u2019s not like that\u2019s the END end of Mark and Ethans content. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll make more content together now that they\u2019re closer than ever, just not on Unus Annus.\n\nETA: this was a lot longer than I expected oops.

No explanation for it, no \u201cin one year everything gets deleted\u201d warning, just funny videos with a countdown at the end. I bet none of this would have happened and none of it wild have been this massively archived.\n\nAnd that seems obvious. But that\u2019s also kind of my point. It isn\u2019t upsetting necessarily because it wouldn\u2019t have happened: there are always people who save videos, even if it\u2019s just cause it\u2019s just a video they like. It\u2019s upsetting because, they KNEW what was going to happen, and specifically set out to do whatever they could to make sure it didn\u2019t. \n\nJust my 2 cents, I know most people on this thread are pretty indifferent towards the archiving, but regardless",

Moments can last forever, if you keep them with you. But sharing them across media takes away from its personal-ness and sentimentality, and the importance of cherishing what's passed.",
            "Trust me. unus and annus know, and I'm under the impression that \"re-upload on YouTube\" is the only thing banned, as everywhere else is kinda out of their control... like the thousands of torrents out there, also this is not re submission, no monetary gain is gleaned, and no numbers go up, this is just digital files shared between fans, not copyright infringement, so even if they wanted to take them down, they couldn't stop the clock... to use their phrase.

Not too rarely worse red flags than before. That's exactly why the JRE and other clown shows are considered the start of pipelines to the more radical ideologies and groups.

And if you find yourself agreeing with what they're saying on his show a lot and feel alienated, you should. Because your ideals, your ideas, your very being is not aligned with reality. For the same reason why it always seems like education skews left. For the same reason why over time society skews more left. Because the more open minded, the better educated and the more empathetic you are, the more left you lean automatically. No conspiracy, propaganda, lies, etc. needed. Nobody's being told how to think or talk or believe. Those things come natural to humans.

It is institutionally, structurally evil to a point that even when well-meaning medical professionals work in good faith they're basically forced to be an extension of that evil. Women are mistrusted by default and need to prove they're worthy of the kind of credibility and care men get automatically.  I can't even imagine what it's like for non-white people or people who are visibly poor. Almost nobody wants to do anything but make it worse. \n\nHere's the real-life horror story my wife lived through- and I mean *horror*:\n\nShe had a gallstone in her early 20s. It got lodged in her bile duct, where it created a near-total obstruction. At least, that's what we think happened and when. This led to intense, nearly constant pain. It hurt so bad she couldn't walk sometimes. Most days she couldn't go to work or chase after our kids.  \n\nWe went to our PCP who gave her pain meds so she could function and referred us to a specialist. After about 5 minutes, the specialist said it was probably an ulcer. My wife told the doc she had experienced an ulcer in the past and the pain was nothing like that. \n\nSo the specialist, **before any testing or imaging or anything else was done**, asked if she had any issues with anxiety or depression. He made a point of mentioning, **multiple times**, that their office would not prescribe opiates and that they never prescribe opiates under any conditions.\n\nThe idea that my wife was crazy or running an elaborate drug-seeking scam (when you can get fucking opiates for $25 on any street corner) was more plausible to him than the possibility she was a trustworthy, intelligent person suffering in a way he didn't expect. It almost seemed like he was insulted by how difficult she was being.\n\nWeeks later, they finally did a scope on her, they looked into her stomach and found a tiny remnant of the ulcer she'd had long before. Guess what the conclusion was? Not \"ok, that's clearly not the cause, so there must be something else wrong\", but \"Okay, that's clearly not the cause, so this proves she's exaggerating her symptoms.\"\n\nThey told us they checked everything it could possibly be, and found nothing. She had done some research and specifically asked if it could be related to the gallbladder and they rejected that with a little lecture about how she'd only work herself up going on WebMD. I remember the nurse told some joke about it that we both laughed at- they're good at making you doubt yourself when you shouldn't.\n\nWe were young, without support, and largely ignorant about this stuff so we assumed they knew what they were talking about, even if we knew she wasn't an addict or nutcase. We figured it must be something minor that was causing an inordinate amount of pain. Over time, we'd see other doctors, go into the emergency room when it got really bad, and nobody ever took her seriously, no doctors, nurses, or staff whether male or female ever gave her the benefit of the doubt. \n\nEvery time we tried to get help, someone would inevitably mention (casually, in passing, maybe as an afterthought, or in the same way you might bring up a *fun fact*)  that they don't prescribe opiates for that kind of thing. Let me be clear: this chick does not now and has never looked like a drug addict. She dresses like someone who was good friends with Kate Spade. She talks like an English Major with a midwestern Baptist upbringing. We can only assume they put something in her records about her long-running scam to get meager amounts of narcotics served with heaping helpings of disapproval, suspicion, and scorn.\n\nFinally, the scar tissue built up and the bile duct ruptured. The pain she'd come to live with and accept went through the roof and we again went to the hospital, but this time she had other signs- a high fever and a white cell count that produced a visible panic reaction in the doctor when he was told, things her female idiocy and hysteria couldn't explain. They rushed her to a bigger hospital, and then to a hospital clinic with the best doctors in the country for that kind of thing. They barely saved her life, and after *two additional years* of treatments and surgeries to repair the damage, with medical bills I can't even comprehend, she's finally feeling somewhat better- even though she'll never get to 100%.\n\nWhy did she need two years of ongoing surgeries to treat a gall stone? That pain started in her early 20s, the rupture happened at 46. She spent literally half her fucking life, almost the entire time our children were being raised, existing in a level of torturous pain few of us can imagine, because the medical system is set up to treat women like her as nuisances first who need to prove to someone that they deserve serious consideration before they receive it. The system is better at conveying the prejudices and errors of previous doctors to new ones than it is at discovering when something has been missed. \n\n**Here's what I wish I'd known back then:** If you love someone who isn't being taken seriously by our evil, cruel system, you need to trust what they say above what the doctors say and fight for them. You need to abandon the assumption that the system is fair or just, even when the individual people acting as it's agents seem like nice people.  That's what structural discrimination does, it makes good people do evil things that seem ordinary to them. If you're a white dude, you have a lot of power to vouch for their trustworthiness and sanity. Don't be afraid to call a doctor out on their bullshit.

            "I think a lot of redditors that have taken his side probably did because if they were in the same situation they probably would've done a similar thing. Gus' actions are clearly the result of an immature guy who wasn't ready to handle an uncomfortable situation and his refusal to handle it irrevocably traumatized his partner.  But just because you can understand why he acted the way he did doesn't mean it wasn't abusive and horrible.\n\nIt reminds me of the youtuber Kuncan Dastner who said about Shane Dawson that they can always choose not to come back.

It just seems a little fucked up that the internet as a whole doesn't seem to *want* bad people to change.

But as a programmer I'd like to talk about my disappointment with other programmers who covered his leaked sourcecode.\n\nSomeone apparently decompiled the game and released a 16,700 line C# class file that appears to contain the most important parts of the game logic, with many game mechanics and AI behaviours. It's pretty dreadful in a lot of ways. It has multiple functions of over 1000 lines, the longest with 6000 (and this does not seem to be a result of compiler inlining since YandereDev acknowledged the file length). That alone will make most experienced coders bury their face in frustration because it's a huge indicator for poorly structured, difficult to maintain spaghetti code.\n\nThere are a lot of videos of programmers analysing this file, many of which have over 100k views, some even over a million. And sadly few of them hit the mark. For example there is an awful lot of very extensive talk about details like replacing if-else chains (or occasionally even worse, chains of pure elses that are mutually exclusive) with switches for performance reasons.  This stuff is easy to notice, but will often get optimised away by compilers anyway and is but just a drop in the bucket compared to the overall structural issues.",

Back on subredditdrama, MUA mod [Fairydustandunicorns replies](https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/amh4ct/user_at_makeupaddiction_reveals_a_poster_as/efm6ej7/) that jeffgoldblumisdaddy was \"banned for calling someone a liberal bitch.\" Jeffgoldblumisdaddy [claims](https://www.reddit.com/r/rareinsults/comments/aftf7a/banned_from_rfunny_after_my_1st_time_posting_rare/ee1pn4u/?context=3) that yes, they did, but it was because that user had been stalking and sexually harassing them and they snapped, but the mods did not care when they tried to explain this. jeffgoldblumisdaddy says they \"have the receipts\" regarding this exchange. [MUA mod HermioneGee](https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/amh4ct/user_at_makeupaddiction_reveals_a_poster_as/efm95lp/?context=3) also makes an appearance in this thread to argue with other redditors and claim that the mods don't discuss bans outside of the subreddit.\n6.

Kbuoy asks for clarification about the \"name calling\", [Mods do not respond](https://imgur.com/a/1whG7GD) to her.\n8.

            "I'll give my perspective as an Iranian for those interested in how this splintering came about. \n\nThe original sub /Iran had moderators very sympathetic to the monarchy that was overthrown 40 years ago. Anyway, when Iran news was quite the place usually had non controversial stuff (typically touristy stuff). \n\nHowever, Iran gets in the news often and here is where the problem started. Though opposition to the government is widespread, topics like sanctions and war become controversial. \n\nLots of news/opinion coming from right wing neocons that were framed as the US needing to sanction/attack Iran became prevalent. \n\nLots of Iranians, who don't like the government, despise sanctions aimed at Iranian economy and naturally become defensive when the topic arises. \n\nThis created the first split where many diaspora Iranians were basically cheering sanctions/isolation of Iran and others viewing them as traitors living safely in the west who were cheering for Iranian misery. \n\nThis plus the constant nostalgia posts (usually pics of rich Iranians in the 70's dressed western) became too much so a new sub was created /Iranian where the pro-shah and pro sanction stuff wasn't promoted as much. \n\nNow we have these recent protests which have further polarized people. \n\n\nAnyway, I was banned from /Iran but not for anything political. Basically trolled some Euro guy asking how he can date Iranian woman by telling him he should first ask the woman's father for permission on his intention to sleep with her. \n\nI thought it was pretty funny tbh.",

I don\u2019t agree with them, but I can see their point and they only hand out temporary bans, so I wouldn\u2019t get the old pitchfork out.",
            "This post itself is literally just a ploy for the tiny sub of newiran to promote itself. How is it \"drama\" for random users to be banned for violating a sub's rules? Notice how all of the links provided by the OP are just links to /r/newiran posts where people complain that they got banned from subreddits for breaking the rules.\n\nWhere is the drama? Is this the standard for \"drama\" now? \"We violated the rules of various subs and got banned\" is not drama. It's self-promotion, especially when it's obvious that OP is clearly taking a side.\n\nThe very first sentence is misinformation.

At the time I had the worst choosing beggar of a roommate you can imagine, let\u2019s call her K. She \u201cworked\u201d from home (aka, her parents supported her while she occasionally taught English to local kids) and kept borrowing my stuff without asking. A couple of times she had the guts to get pissed off about me wearing MY clothes when she \u201chad been planning on wearing them.\u201d I kept quiet because the lease was on her name and she wouldn\u2019t complain about my boyfriend coming over. I could write a book about all the crap she pulled on me. This story is about the last straw.\n\nI go on vacation with my boyfriend for 2 weeks, when I get back I notice my bike is missing a pedal. Turns out K used it and broke it. When I ask why she didn\u2019t tell me (or fix it!) she says \u201cit happened like the second day you were gone so I just forgot.\u201d I ask her to get it fixed, she says \u201coh but I am reeeeally broke, you know I am really broke, plus the bike was already in bad shape so why should I have to pay for it? It\u2019s really not expensive to get it fixed, I\u2019m sure.\u201d I try to argue but in the end it\u2019s not like I could force her to pay. The problem now was that the only place in our area that fixed bicycles closed before I got off work and was also closed on my day off. I would have taken a day off to fix my bike but I was just coming back from a 2 week vacation and really couldn\u2019t get time off for a long time. I had to take the (shitty) bus. Fast forward a couple of weeks, K comes home with a brand new bicycle. I should have slapped her but I was kind of a pushover back then. I was so angry I almost cried. I asked her if now she\u2019s obviously not broke she can replace my pedal, she says \u201cI really shouldn\u2019t, because the bike was already in bad shape when I borrowed it.\u201d It wasn\u2019t, but as I said, I was a pushover. I try to give her money for it and ask her if she can just take the bike to the store but she\u2019s \u201ctoo busy\u201d. -for anyone wondering why my boyfriend didn\u2019t help me get my bike fixed, he was in the military and only got off base on weekends (when the store was closed)- I eventually move out, go live with my boyfriend, but I never get over the whole bike thing. Then one night talking to my boyfriend I mention how K\u2019s bike is always locked by the stairwell inside the building, I still have the code to the building.

A couple of times she had the guts to get pissed off about me wearing MY clothes when she \u201chad been planning on wearing them.\u201d I kept quiet because the lease was on her name and she wouldn\u2019t complain about my boyfriend coming over. I could write a book about all the crap she pulled on me. This story is about the last straw.\n\n> I go on vacation with my boyfriend for 2 weeks, when I get back I notice my bike is missing a pedal. Turns out K used it and broke it. When I ask why she didn\u2019t tell me (or fix it!) she says \u201cit happened like the second day you were gone so I just forgot.\u201d I ask her to get it fixed, she says \u201coh but I am reeeeally broke, you know I am really broke, plus the bike was already in bad shape so why should I have to pay for it? It\u2019s really not expensive to get it fixed, I\u2019m sure.\u201d I try to argue but in the end it\u2019s not like I could force her to pay. The problem now was that the only place in our area that fixed bicycles closed before I got off work and was also closed on my day off. I would have taken a day off to fix my bike but I was just coming back from a 2 week vacation and really couldn\u2019t get time off for a long time. I had to take the (shitty) bus. Fast forward a couple of weeks, K comes home with a brand new bicycle. I should have slapped her but I was kind of a pushover back then. I was so angry I almost cried. I asked her if now she\u2019s obviously not broke she can replace my pedal, she says \u201cI really shouldn\u2019t, because the bike was already in bad shape when I borrowed it.\u201d It wasn\u2019t, but as I said, I was a pushover. I try to give her money for it and ask her if she can just take the bike to the store but she\u2019s \u201ctoo busy\u201d. -for anyone wondering why my boyfriend didn\u2019t help me get my bike fixed, he was in the military and only got off base on weekends (when the store was closed)- I eventually move out, go live with my boyfriend, but I never get over the whole bike thing. Then one night talking to my boyfriend I mention how K\u2019s bike is always locked by the stairwell inside the building, I still have the code to the building. I meant it as a joke but my boyfriend got dead serious. The next morning K\u2019s fancy bike was missing a pedal.\n\n\n**Also these got removed:**\n\n[\"Naturally...\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/VoiceyHere/comments/ar0cgf/i_still_had_the_code_to_her_building/eglnesc?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) here:\n\n> Coming from your other thread about the dog.

Plus pan handling pity. Unfortunately, most of these kids drug their dogs to keep them complacent. They are unhealthy and underfed. Don't get me started on how they recruit young pretty girls who wish to rebel to make money for them after convincing them destroying their ID is the right thing to do... And lots of heroin... but anyway... \n\nA few of the non-niche homeless or homeless-looking (on purpose) street \"performers\" do this as well, but also drug the dogs to make them \"play dead\" for hours for tips from tourists wearing goofy things. One of the biggest, more famous ones gives his pup a concoction of cough medicine and other things, something he has bragged about. The gutter punks typically  just use a smidge of their stash.\n\nOne of the gutter punks sold off a puppy for 20 bucks to an old roommate once, dropped down from 40 bc they were jonesing hard. You don't want to know what a puppy doing through wds looks like... \n\nAnyway, yeah. Don't give those people money when you visit Bourbon Street/French Quarter. They are truly awful people. In 7 years I've met less than 5 homeless people who actually cared for and loved their dogs instead of treating them like a money-making prop that makes loitering easier. After a while you can tell one from the other if you frequent the area/watch/talk to them. I don't mind helping those few.\n\nI hope it's only a big issue here...\n\nCarry on...\n\n\n",

For some bonus drama, [here's a comment section from 2007 arguing about it.](https://www.gamespot.com/forums/xbox-association-1000003/microsoft-explains-why-we-have-to-pay-for-xbox-liv-25728968/) And [here's another one from 2009.](https://www.xboxachievements.com/forum/topic/140987-paying-for-xbox-live-gold-is-a-stupid/) Despite this, and despite the [persistent rumors](https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355756/microsoft-xbox-live-rename-gold-free-rumors) that Xbox Live will soon be free of charge, the price has remained the same for the last 11 years - $60 per year.*\n\nSo with all that in mind, early yesterday morning Microsoft released an article titled [\"Update on Xbox Live Gold Pricing\"](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/01/22/update-on-xbox-live-gold-pricing/), in which they announced that instead of $60 per year, Xbox Live would now cost $60 per six months, effectively doubling the price. \n\n[People were not happy.](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/l2s7h0/look_i_completely_understand_why_theyve_raised/) Discussion threads filled with comments in /r/Xbox, /r/XboxSeriesX, and /r/Games. The vast majority of the anger was, of course, directed at Microsoft. But as with any event that generates multiple large threads of discussion, arguments were inevitable. \n\n**Some users in /r/Xbox sparked arguments by arguing that $10 a month is not a lot of money:** \n\n>[That\u2019s $10 a month.

But the jump in price really sucks for whatever their reasoning.\n\nEdit: Oh good, Microsoft quickly backpedaled on the price increase; in my humble opinion it was a really tonedeaf decision in the first place- to increase the price of products in an economic recession and pandemic is just like a slap in the face. I guess I can see it from the angle of people are bored of being home so they'll pay for entertainment from home like gaming but still... it's callous and so capitalistic which is predictable for all companies but man for once I'm with the gamers on this one.",

            "It\u2019s kind of amazing to me how MS and Sony have indoctrinated people into paying to play video games online. Not to go all PCMR, but playing online on PC has always been, and remains, free. There\u2019s no reason to charge people to play online except that they can. When playing console games online was new, they basically took advantage of that novelty to make money without any real added value. Only when they started including free games did it actually become something of value, though I suppose that value is subjective and debatable.\n\nBut to get your own customers to argue that a 100% price increase is entirely justified is a hell of an achievement, and suggests to me that the video game market is not entirely rational.",
            "> Haha you morons are so gullible. I find it hard to believe Microsoft made such a huge reversal decision in the span of 12 hours. This was PR.\n\nLol that decision can be made in 5 seconds.\n\n\"Hi boss, the fallout from the price hike is a lot more severe than we were hoping and the CXO wants to know 'what dumbass decided to double the price in a goddamn pandemic'.

            "So you have to buy the console, and the games, and pay for internet......and then you have to pay an extra fee to play YOUR game on YOUR console using YOUR internet? Sounds like a scam. Just buy a PC at that point.",

Being locked in to certain games based on which company you go with, paying just to use your own internet.\n\nHopefully consoles are eventually phased out for pc. I mean it already sucks that PlayStation has all these exclusives that don\u2019t come to PC, but Sony actively fighting crossplay access, so that I can\u2019t play with my friends unless I pay  for a PS4 is just too much. I mean, the technology is there just let people play together.\n\nWe\u2019re kinda at a point right now where entry level PCs are just more expensive than consoles, and not everyone can pay that extra money to make it back later on cheaper games and not paying for online. Once the market gets to a better place and maybe the technology allows for pc builds to be smaller (match how easy it is to pick up a console and bring it somewhere else to play) we can see more people switching. It\u2019s just crazy that their greed is effecting me and I don\u2019t even use their products.",
