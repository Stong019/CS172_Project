He took some udemy courses to get a basic understanding of Flutter and built his app. A very simple app that stores little data and doesn't do anything too intricate, yet it nets him \\~$1,000 a month. You of course don't need a CS degree to build your program. You just need to be intelligent and motivated enough to ... actually build your program.

Not only this, but as much as people negate school name, depending on your target outcome it matters. There hasn\u2019t been a single SWE I\u2019ve met (not working on web apps, where even then CS underpinnings are extremely valuable for perf) without a CS degree. This is of course talking about engineers building new technology, like scaling infra, distributed systems/computing, AI (no bootcamp will ever work for this), etc but again, understanding OSes (a heavy subject) will make an enormous difference for even a mobile app dev, who may have been taught the \u201ctop\u201d and never gone down the stack, as such they might not even know the implications of not freeing memory in app, or the app size binary. \nFurthermore, CS curriculums do *not* teach coding. They teach complex abstractions that are put into practice with code as the tool. Take queueing theory in a networking class for example \u2014 this is easily translatable to an Industrial Engineer optimization problem. To be even *more* controversial, having a strong math and general STEM background is key. For example, putting work for AP Chem/orgo in high school heavily paid off when learning MOSFET - physics understanding pays off when calculating optimal network routing, and so on. \n\nI\u2019ll take the downvotes, but all I\u2019ve done here is put my observations from 3 internships + 3.5 years of FTE at companies that tend to only want CS majors (and ones that many *not all* here may be targeting). HRT, JS, 2s would auto-reject a bootcamp grad (unless they had a physics, EE, stats, math degree). Basically all of these fields have a lot of overlap and complementary abstractions and your ability to impact as an engineer is amplified by knowledge of each area. But fundamentally your CS degree says you had the ability to actually understand how a modern computer works, and further that you\u2019re capable of processing/communicating complex abstractions. \nI kid not, a fund I interviewed with asked me to run them through computer abstraction layers starting from a transistor up to a running, executing process. Had I not invested time in chem, physics, EE, Comp Eng, and finally low level CS I would\u2019ve been shown the door. This is notoriously a very difficult fund in fairness. \n\nsorry for the rant folks, but OP made a post I\u2019ve been wanting to for a while. Bootcamps are great for people who want to be web devs without needing to scale. Yea, there are bootcamp faang devs but they exclusively work on web dev/product (the ones who don\u2019t do product always studied the other above majors) where their tooling is abstracted away by the teams who have CS PhDs. You can reason which team the companies value more.",

A lot of programming jobs *can* be done by someone with just the knowledge from a boot camp (or something else that is to CS what a trade school is to, say, mechE). \n\nJust like I wouldn't want an electrical engineer to wire my house, or an electrician to design an amplifier for an instrument",

            ">The CS major is meant to teach you a practical and logical way of thinking.\n\nclearing knowledge burden or linking up logical thinking is two different thing. are you sure your university training is enough just because it touched some calculus?\n\n> Yeah you have to take linear algebra and discrete math with theoretical classes that seem to mean nothing, but I'd argue that they are useful. These classes teach you how to think and adapt your skill set. \n\nexplain how eigenvalue is useful to general web development (note: not the machine learning side)\n\n> A boot camp could never teach you these things.\n\nMath can be easily self-taught, particularly for  anything below real analysis (aka cal3 and below, applied stats and intro linear algebra). these are all standard curriculum in asian high school. i do not think they are exactly helpful to either general web dev or when building machine learning model.\n\nask some of your data  guys in your company to see if they can explain everything they know rigorously all the way up to the point the tool they use.\n\n>I think people who say going to college and getting a degree is worthless and a stupid financial decision need to actually evaluate all the skills you receive rather than hard skills.\n\ngetting a degree is a signaling effect (as in economics). the math courses teaching you logical is pretty overrated. since most are only knowledge burden. they throw you all the tools and you link up the pieces for a proof. the content really  isnt as useful. am math grad working to cs.",

And there are some jobs/industries that won\u2019t talk to you if you don\u2019t have it.\n\nThats not to say you can\u2019t be successful without it, but you have more opportunities if you do.

People will dress it up, but at the end of the day these tech companies, which receive thousands of applications for a single position, needed some way to weed out applicants, and so they settled on standardized testing.

            "LeetCode is just a website that contains algorithmic problems set up in a programming environment. The problems are quite interesting in nature as they require some mathematics, basic programming syntax, and usage of various data structures as tool to solve the problems. What these problems actually measure is mathematical problem solving skills in a programming environment. It is just like a basic aptitude for problem solving using programming as a tool. Many companies asks similar problems at interview in order to check candidate's problem solving aptitude. The ability to develop and design a software is not necessary conditions for these companies as they care more about candidate's overall programming aptitude and the reason according to them is that if a candidate has algorithmic thinking to solve these problems then he/she can develop or design software in a more efficient way and his learning ability is also understood to be of higher order.\n\nBut for any company, these problem-solving interviews are not complete requirement for candidate's selection. They also conduct system design interviews, do project discussion and also behaviourial interview. Projects in resume do not play a major role still it is a necessary to have some good projects to get the resume shortlisted. The candidate who practice problems like that in leetcode website, tend to become a good learner and learning software engineering and making interesting projects become quite easy. \n\nAll the best!",

            "This was common when I was going through CS, especially the Machine Learning, AI, etc. classes where there\u2019s a lot of abstract principles. \n\nThe best advice I can give is that if you DO copy code from somewhere, find ways to restructure it, recreate the flow, use alternate variables/very blatant stuff, try to find a creative way to approach the problem that *resembles* the solution without straight copying it. Try adding improvements to it as well. Challenge yourself as much as you can. Restructure classes, methods, functions, signatures, expressions, weave in new stuff, etc. \n\nA good way to do this is put solution code on one window for a \u201cflow\u201d guide, and rewrite yours completely from scratch by hand without copy/pasting any of the code and add your own flare/signature to it. I found I learned a lot more when I took this approach as well, as I had to process character by character, block by block, etc. and it eventually became clear. Then I\u2019d rewrite it a few different other ways as well to make sure I really got it. \n\nIf at that point there is still criticism \u2014 just make sure you cite where you got the code from, ask to meet with your professor, see if s/he can walk through it with you and help you really comprehend it. Even the most asshole professors I had at their core really did want to help when I was struggling \u2014 they just didn\u2019t want me slapping my name on something that was very clearly a CTRL+C CTRL+V job. \n\nGood luck and hang in there!",

            "I teach at a university part-time in the evenings on top of my day job in industry. One of the classes I teach is a programming class, so hopefully I can give some insight from a professor\u2019s perspective. \n\nFirst off, I would never give problems that can be found on LC as homework. Maybe as an in class exercise, but certainly not anything that would be graded. That\u2019s just asking for plagiarized answers. \n\nYou need to understand that when a coding assignment is given, it is 100% *expected* that solutions will be similar. All students are receiving the same education, learning the same fundamentals of algorithmic design, data structures, etc. and the problems given coincide with those lessons. However, the assignments are also semi-complex and every problem literally has an infinite number of solutions. Most importantly, and this is where a lot of people get hung up, **there is a vast difference between a *similar* solution and a *copied* solution.** It is extremely easy for a professor to distinguish between the two. \n\nIn the former scenario, you may have two students who take similar approaches to solving a problem, but do so with different code, even though the overall structure and algorithm may be similar. They both solved the problem without copying code and wrote their unique (albeit similar) solution. This is perfectly fine and expected. \n\nIn the latter scenario, you have a student who obviously copied code (either from another student or a solution found online such as YouTube or LC forums) and simply copy / pasted and maybe tried to change variable names thinking it would be enough to fool the professor (it isn\u2019t). This is the scenario that is plagiarism. It is plagiarism because the student is just using other people\u2019s code without doing the work themselves, creating their own solutions, or understanding what the code actually does. \n\nI have no issues with students using google to try to get an understanding of how to approach a problem, seeing how others have solved similar problems, and adjusting their solution from there. That\u2019s how real life works much of the time. What I do have a problem with is students just copy / pasting solutions and trying to be \u201ctricky\u201d about it and pass it off as their work.",

If you get the same prompt for a paper in an new class as a class you did before, you can\u2019t reuse the same paper you wrote, or even parts of it without citations.

            "Previous professor here: AI detection should never be used as grounds for grade reduction.

            "When this happened to me it was because I hosted my assignment on my public GitHub profile and some jackass copied it 100%. It was before I knew to worry about that sort of thing.\n\nIn my case, I was able to explain to the professor exactly how the code works in such depth, and the other student was not able to do that to the same degree, so the professor gave me 90% of the credit back. I guess the 10% dock was for being an idiot and causing trouble in the first place by hosting my code publicly.\n\nMaybe you can ask your professor to do something like this. Have him sit down with you and walk through the code, and do the same with the other student.",
            "I had a professor claim my code was not my own. It was too advanced for the concepts she had taught, and based on how far I was through the CS program. \n\nThe problem? I had 3 years more experience than this professor and was employed by a company doing exactly what she was teaching. It ended up being a huge headache and ultimately led to my quitting school.",

            "One of my buddies got accused of cheating on a test/quiz(i don't remember) that we do through canvas. The professor could tell if we copied and pasted. \n\nOne of the questions was something like:   \nWhat is the output of this line of code:   \nprint(\"ABCD\")\n\nBut probably with some sort of string function. And the answer was ABCD. And instead of typing it out he copied and pasted it. Got accused of googling the questions by copying it, and him and the professor went back and forth a few times. The professor wouldn't understand why he would copy/pasting such a short string instead of typing it out. I don't remember what ended up happening, it was a years back. \n\nBut you can typically bring it up to the head of your department if the professor isn't budging. And if that doesn't work, most schools have a conflict-resolution/plagarism center. Most professors will try to find a resolution before getting to that level but if he isn't budging go for it. Probably better for you to bring it to them, than for your professor to approach them first. \n\n**But i guess it also depends on policy and how much this grade affects you.**   \n-If this grade doesn't change your overall grade/gpa, don't bother. Take the L and move on. Personally, I would move on even if it dropped me a letter grade that was still passing, and if i didn't have to take another class with that same professor. My gpa wasn't perfect, and I don't want to a take a class where the professor is gonna hold something against me.  \n\n-If your school expels you after 1 plagarism offense and you take it to the plagarism/conflict center, you could potentially lose the case and get expeled. I think my school would expel you after two offenses. \n\n1/3 of my CS professors were subborn assholes who will die on their hill. And if you take it to the conflict/plagarism center, don't be surprised if he starts analyzing your previous assignments.  \nGoodluck!",

            "This happened to me and my friends in school. Professor said we cheated because we were the only 3 from the class that technically got the write answer. All of our code was different because we didn\u2019t work on it together but since we were friends and sat by each other we got called out for cheating. After that day I commented every single line of code explaining the logic and never got accused of cheating again. \n\nIt\u2019s very disheartening when you know you don\u2019t cheat and get accused of it anyway. Just fight like hell with solid evidence and really dig deep to explain the code and WHY you did it the way you did.",

Ask if there are ways he would be willing to let you do assignments with a proctor assigned in class since he can't trust you to code on your own.\u00a0 If he refuses to work with you, you may need to just go super high up and escalate this.\u00a0\n\n\nBe prepared to challenge the shitty precedent of AI plagiarism checkers. Do your research on how they work well. You'll need to demonstrate somehow that it's easy to plagiarize without realizing it. Also how similar simple assignment solutions are going to create false positives and cause students to lose faith in their program.",
