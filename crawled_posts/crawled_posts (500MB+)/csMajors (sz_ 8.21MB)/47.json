Intern takes very light duties that are not as beneficial to the company, if at all, and they will only be staying for a few months so it doesn\u2019t make sense to invest in training and patience.\n2. A junior dev is expected to remain with the company and develop in their career.

I looked up what they ask on LeetCode Discuss, knew the exact questions and so I wrote up answers in LeetCode Playground and just looked at my other monitor to type them into the OA. 100%.\n\nI got to the phone round; this time, I did not cheat, but I knew what they were going to ask and prepared beforehand. Pass.\n\nOnsite round, same thing. I did not cheat, but again knew what they would ask. And they did.\n\nJust got an offer. The offer is $140K + $50K stocks. I don't feel bad about knowing the phone and onsite questions, personally, but I do feel bad that I just blatantly copied to pass the OA. I could have even taken the time to learn the problems they ask, but didn't because I felt lazy.\n\nAm I morally obligated to decline the offer?\n\nEDIT: For those asking how to find the questions, go to leetcode.com/discuss and search Coinbase under Interview Questions and Interview Experience tabs (allegedly).",

(Years ago, I prepped for interview questions by skimming Meyer's Effective C++ which was reliable in telling someone what to do in coding scenarios). Failing to prepare is preparing to fail.\n\nThe real question is if you are screwing yourself by taking a job that requires high competency when your own skills may be limited to memorizing leetcode, a useful yet perhaps limited skillet. \n\nHere's my take - if you can burn the candle at both ends, you'll be fine i.e. work hard during working hours and perfect your craft in the evening / weekends. If you can get a mentor at Coinbase, even better. Perfecting your craft can range from working on your own projects, learning other engineering disciplines (DevSecOps & IAC / data engineering / networking  / cloud platforms / etc.) Even if you start behind, grinding will get you ahead of your less motivated peers in no time.",

So that more people know how to deal with the shitty experience that is interviewing.\n\nAnother way to pay it forward is to go ahead and refer a shit ton of people to Coinbase, mentor younger dudes/gals and help them with their career. \n\nTake the money you earn and do something good to the world. Or better yet, buy something nice for your parents, or whoever you are grateful to.\n\nDecline this and you are just another sad fuck crying in the corner with minimal impact (positive/negative) on the world and people around you.\n\nFinally, congrats!!! And remember to protect yourself, don't let this post come back and bite you in the future because people find out who wrote it.",
            "The only thing an interview is doing is trying to gauge whether you'll be good at the job.\n\nIf you accept the offer and you aren't a good fit. No big deal, you can quit or they'll just fire you.\n\nIf you accept the offer and you are a great fit because leetcode and the bullshit interviews seen all over the industry are bullshit and hardly applicable to the position.

She also got offers from Uber, Google, Meta, and other companies. I, on the other hand, was luck enough to get a somewhat decent internship from Apple. Now she is constantly making fun of me because her hourly pay is more than mine ($63/hr vs $50/hr). She said that she can give me one of her offers (higher hourly rate than mine obviously) to make sure I can keep up with her. She also said that, if we dated, she would be the man of the relationship since she brings more bread to the table (although I bring Apple).\n\nEvery other guy (5) at school is trying to be her friend. Each of those guys got an internship at Citadel, Jump Trading, Optiver, Akuna Capital, and Radix Trading respectively. Should I just accept my failure and tell her to end the frienship? Or should I accept my punishment for being shit this recruiting season and let another guy be her friend?\n\nOh and she said she can't have her reputation be ruined by being friends with someone like me. \n\n&#x200B;",

Leetcode is perhaps one of the most pro-working-class hiring system that has lifted thousands of working-class students to move up the social ladder.\n\nNo other industries (besides engineering) have given working-class applicants the opportunity in the field than the tech industry and thanks to leetcode, applicants with very little to no experience can break it into the industry. \n\nIf you think the tech industry is unfair, it is because you have not worked in different industries before. For instance, in the finance and law field, your pedigree matters which weeds out students from a working-class background. If you want to work in politics, it is near impossible to even work as an intern if you did not attend one of the top 10 universities. (That's why most politicians are rich and I have yet to find a single politician from a working-class background)\n\nHowever, because of leetcode, no matter your background, you have to go through the same trial, which gives equal opportunity to both poor and rich.\n\nSo really, IMO if you are against leetcode then you are in a way contributing to this anti-working class atmosphere.\n\nKeep Leetcode!

And that's ignoring the fact that most people aspire to have lives outside of the cycle of grinding for school/resume/money/interviews.  If I had to pick one element to remove from the cycle to make the \"working class\" CS experience better, it would absolutely be leetcode.

It's like social media, where you only hear about people's accomplishments and not their failed projects or lost internships. But we lose out on a lot of opportunity when we don't talk about failure. Failure is essential because it means we are pushing ourselves, but it's crucial that we are supporting each other and giving encouragement when it happens.

Anyways, you're right; CS is a difficult major but don't ever think that you need to switch majors. **In my opinion, if CS is the degree you want more than any other degree, switching would be giving up. Never give up.** \n\n**Failing exams happens to all of us. You can fail midterms and hell even finals and still get A's in the classes in some cases.** I'm pretty sure most schools have curved grading scales for CS and probably other difficult majors as well. That's probably why kids still have 4.0s lol. \n\nAlso, tests and grading for CS theory courses has been a terrible experience for me. I've answered test questions with textbook definitions verbatim and had those questions marked as incorrect even though they were correct. The case for these courses is that the professors have strict grading rubrics and TAs don't want to give you points if the answer doesn't exactly match the rubric (even if it's right) because they don't want to have to explain why they gave points out to an answer that wasn't the exact rubric answer. **My point is this: your grades don't always reflect your ability or what you know.**\n\n**My advice for dealing with kids like Jake is don't.** Consider them as gone and prepare to pick up those student's responsibilities with the help of your contributing team members. This avoids conflict (which I hate), and gives you that much more experience. Also, you can be sure that your project will be how you and your contributors want it to be because you won't have to worry about crappy code from the slacker in the group. The kid will benefit with the grade, but in my opinion, **you have to ask yourself if you'd rather deal with the conflict and force a crappy teammate to work with you and give you crappy results OR get the grade you want and deserve.** \n\n**I appreciate your video.** CS is a quietly competitive field so it's nice to see a post that isn't a braggadocious success story.",

            "Something I also wish I\u2019d known is there\u2019s a limit on how many times I can repeat a course (they count W\u2019s).  It\u2019s just a bunch of gatekeeping garbage meant to keep power/wealth in the hands of the elite.",
            "Man! I studied languages in highschool. Got good grades and was told that I'd make be good at it in college. My smart-feeling add got tired of it and I went CS in college. My smart-feeling ass turned to complete donkey and I failed my Calculus 101 20 times(at least). In Italy you can take the classes' exams as many times as you want until you pass them. The thing is some classes block your advancement to other classes. You can take them but you cannot do the final exam until you \"unblock\" the others. Long story short, I got stuck many times. I was in my third year but I still had classes from two previous years to complete. Many time I thought that maybe I was wrong to go CS that maybe I'd be a good interpreter by now. I cried many times. Felt that I didn't belong there that I made a wrong choice and took more than I can chew. But then at some point I faced my Calculus fear. It was make it or break it. \nI got C on it but fuck! I just unblocked all other classes and exams! After Calculus I passed 4 exams in a row in 2 months! I went on that streak until my graduation day! I of course had several C,b and As but that didn't matter in the end. I made it to the end. In my thesis defense, I got the commitee's ears all for me and they listened to my 7 minutes defence. I got compliments on how good I did and the graduation committee asked my if I wanted to stay to pursue my masters while working on the continuation of my thesis. I said no because I wanted field experience.\nI spent so many days lurking in what I could not do. How others were better, how different it could've been if I studied languages. I accepted my failures and changed my point of view. A C is not a failure but a small step towards the end. Failing is ok but always learn from them.",
            "I mean why don't you just abuse TA hours? Lots of your friends probably do XD. Kids straight up turning up at hours without having even read the handout LOL. EDIT Ok you went to them in the video nice!\n\nEDIT: Watched the video saw it was about a midterm. \n\nHeres what I do to have been doing to be doing well above average for every CS class I have taken at Stanford for the past 4 years.\n\n1) Go to lectures (or watch them live in the current situation)\n\n2) Take notes on my iPad.\n\n3) That night write notes from all the days lectures aesthetically.\n\n4) Day after read aesthetic notes again.\n\n5) Rinse and repeat but also reread notes from previous lectures and highlight shit before step 3.\n\nSpaced Repetition. Spaced Repetition. Spaced Repetition.\n\nBonus: Start any assignment day it was given out.\n\nSource: Senior at Stanford.\n\nRegarding group projects in the case where nobody other than me has any experience. I basically carry them myself and assign subtasks relative to the aptitude of each of my other group members so everybody feels like they are contributing. As you have experienced even at Stanford there are people who don't try.",
            "If you think college is hard, boy do I have a surprised for you. Life is fucking harder",
            "I\u2019ve had to withdraw from linear algebra twice. I have no idea how I\u2019m ever going to pass that darn class ;-;",
            "One think I want to bring out is that the more early you have had exposure to CS, the easier the classes are for you. Just think about how much easier your first sem classes would be if you had taken them as a sophomore level student. Those brilliant students are not smarter than you. They just have more experience and have spent a lot more time coding and doing math than you.",
            "Thank you so much. College is hard. It's really fucking hard. I'm a sophomore right now studying computer science and Statistics. School along with jobs and money and social problems and trying to find time to do the things you love doing is So.Fucking.Hard. So thank you for putting this out there, because it's important. We'll get through this just fine. Don't worry :) Alright now I gotta finish an algorithms project lol.",
            "I'm currently at City College in San Francisco finishing up my last CS courses (before I transfer to a 4-year) while working full-time as an IT Engineer at the moment and I gotta say I totally resonate with what you mention in your video. A few months ago, I encouraged myself to be more social and vocal about these matters with my classmates in these classes because I'm sure as hell we're not the only ones feeling this type of way. I've met students who are in your shoes and my shoes but we're both here because of our drive. We've busted our asses to get to this point in our lives and it's ok if our best is not the best. Success does not have an expiration date, failure does.",
            "Oh man. @OP I am aware. \n\nA friend of mine went there. I didn\u2019t realize that people would jump from the bell tower.\n\nStanford actually, really, truly does have a problem with expectation management and the \u201cwhat else / what now\u201d questions that can come up. \n\nDouble-whammy: make it through with a PhD from there and THEN face the also-unexpected crisis of \u201cAAAAGGGGggghhhh ... ahhh ........... ... okay, I\u2019m done. Now what?\u201d Suddenly having your all-consuming work end, even if it is because you\u2019ve passed defense, is a bewildering and strange thing to deal with.",
            "In my CS program, in nearly all core classes, the norm was failure.  Tests were designed to be so difficult that most of the class failed without a curve.  It made the geniuses really stand out, which is I guess why they did it?  It was absolutely brutal and took a long time to not feel like an absolute failure.  The only way we could tell if we were actually failing the class would be comparing grades with classmates.",
            "I couldn't get past differentials and so I switched majors from cs to something else.  Math kicked my butt.",
            "University physics made me cry. Not symbolically; literally it made me cry. There have been other times where I felt defeated, upset when I couldn\u2019t do a programming assignment, exhausted etc. \n\nWe just need to keep pushing through. CS is not an easy degree. We got this :)",
            "Really liked your honest view!",
            "For all of my classes I gave myself a pass, \u201cgo for an A, but if you get a B that\u2019s okay\u201d. For some of my harder classes this modified to, \u201cgo for an A, but if I get a C that\u2019s okay\u201d. \n\nFor my cs classes specifically, however, I\u2019ve given myself an additional pass to \u201cfail\u201d. And what I mean by this, is really to be okay with being wrong most of the time. \n\nWhen I started programming at 24 - shortly before college - I second guessed myself all the time because i was so used to learning low-skill or intuitive subjects with relative ease. I hadn\u2019t done something this challenging before and while that was invigorating because there was so much room to grow, it was also an uphill battle that left me wondering day-in-day-out if I was cut out for it. Before going through this, I tended to like the things that took me minimal effort and that I was good at. For some reason, even struggling to do so, I liked programming. Not getting it right a way was a humbling experience because here I was before college, looking at my peers in swe roles thinking that all they did was go to school, get a cs degree, then get a swe job. Naively I thought, the degree was the ticket. Not putting in effort outside of class, Not building side projects, Not doing a bunch of LC, Not learning most of this on your own time. \n\nNow that I\u2019m a cs student, I see that the degree alone doesn\u2019t get you in. I must also learn on my own. I use school as a platform to boost my learning outside of school. Specifically for cs classes, I might not get the best grade, but I go in with the intention that I will practice the lessons I learn here. I don\u2019t care as much about some paper test, unless it\u2019s data structures or any algorithms course, as I do about getting a good understanding of how things work under the hood so I can go do it myself.",
            "I study in a fucking unranked university(due to circumstances), and I always solve MIT and Stanford exams it's not that hard (keep in mind my education is not that great)",
            "Nobody talks about failure as most people here assume people will be successful in their job hunt, not even considering people failing at actually acquiring their degree. This is implicit in the subreddits name. It assumes that you are currently a cs major. Typically if a cs major fails they switch majors.",

            "I think this failure is part of your success story, I've had a lot of success in my CS career at Stanford but I've also had a lot of failures. Obviously, I am not a LinkedIn \"thought leader\" so I never talk about these things with anyone other than with my very close CS friends. Overall, its just the way life goes and your success will come with persistence even when it feels like you've failed at everything. Didnt get a CS major? Didnt get an internship? Your career could still likely be equally satisfying at the next CS person. Plus the bar for success at Stanford is so high by reinforced bias as is."
