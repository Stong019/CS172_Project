Finding common ground and respecting each other's boundaries is key to fostering a positive atmosphere.\n\nEncouraging more diverse activities outside of coding, like sports, social events, or just spending time outdoors, could also help break the cycle of constant tech talk and encourage a healthier work-life balance.\n\nUltimately, it might take some effort to shift the culture, but even small changes can make a difference in creating a more welcoming and balanced community within the CS program",

Perhaps it's a sign that you should be your own boss.  Maybe you're not made to be an employee.

            "I don\u2019t mind the geekiness tbh but just wait till you start noticing those that try to belittle everyone else. They usually treat you like you\u2019re incapable of anything for not knowing as much as them. Yes , unfortunately, the hygiene think is real. Here in California you get a lot of people with swamp ahh",
            "this is why i never fucking go to lectures man",
            "Stereotypes don\u2019t exist out of nowhere",
            "I've experienced this as well. I feel there are a lot of social rejects who believe \"I am misunderstood because I'm smarter than everyone else.\" Usually they have no evidence to back that up and spend most of their free time playing video games / consuming media. They picked CS because they like video games and think they will become a game developer.\n\nUsually they drop out after realizing that snapping together a gaming PC doesn't mean you know anything and it requires actual work. Then they go back to Mama's basement. In the workforce it's mostly normal guys who are slightly shy / nerdy.\n\nThose who go to boot camps are similar but are often less nerdy but more lazy / burnouts who think they found a get rich quick scheme and are \"beating the system\".\n\nI work with one of the bad ones. He's incompetent and believes anything he doesn't understand is \"over complicated\". He's unwilling to learn anything new because of his arrogance.\n\nThe rest of my team is humble and we all learn from each other. We are all capable of going to meetings and acting like normal adults.\n\nIt is a hassle dealing with a lot of these arrogant / obnoxious people but you should realize that if you are humble and able to work on a team you will have a huge advantage in the workforce.\n\nI love my job but I do wish there were more people with other interests besides gaming. A lot of people look down on me for not playing video games, they treat me like I'm an outsider or something haha.",
            "It attracts the gamers. I game myself, but only play awful games where u have to try to get good (league, csgo, etc.). The single player mutts and pseudo intellectuals will die during calc 1 or 2.",
            "Yeah theres a place for them in our field.\n\nYou have 2 kinds of developers: the monkey in a box that never does anything other than tickets. They are generally an optics nuke or too autistic to put in front of any customer/management types for requirements and demos.  Sometimes these guys become your context masters on old projects because they can make some nuts solutions.  Oppenheimer wishes he made this non-lethal cringe nuke instead of the bomb. \n\nYour second type is the rizz king. Nat 20 persuasion check. They should be speaking and in leadership roles, and sometimes they only get the job because they can do the technical really well because leetcoding is easy; but because leetcode sucks for actually evaluating a dev, they might still be useless as an actual coder.\n\nBoth of these guys have their perks and you should put them in their spots on your team.  If you have an autistic rizz king, they\u2019re probably the only thing holding that project together.",
            "Honestly it\u2019s true lol.   Feel like cs major is full of weirdos who are way over competitive.  There\u2019s usually like five \u201cnormal\u201d people in each class who find each other.  \n\nGood news is the real working world isn\u2019t like this, people are normal there.",
            "In the real world people won't hire you if they don't like you. So zero skill points in empathy and social skills will screw these guys over. No one wants to work with a (1) know-it-all (2) incompetent people (3) people with zero 'emotional' intelligence. They should honestly have a class for all the autistic people in comp sci teaching them basic normie skills and fail everyone who acts obnoxious in the class. It would probably increase their employability more dramatically than their entire 4 year degree.",
            "Just wait until you notice how many dudes there are\u2026",
            "I don't know if this is a CS thing or a 'gen ed' thing. I took a gen ed philosophy class and it was pretty chill. I liked it and thought I'd try to pick up a minor in philosophy.\n\nMy second philosophy class was almost exclusively philosophy majors and they exhibited all the same 'look how smart I am' behaviors.\n\nAnyway, I know the conventional wisdom is 'They are insecure and the really talented students don't feel the need to participate in such things'; in practice I found that's rarely the case. I mean, it gets better...most of them will calm down, but it's also likely that some of the most annoying will also be some of the most knowledge.\n\nThey've also tied feelings of their selfworth to their performance in class. It might not be healthy, but it is a great motivator. They will 'try hard', study a lot, spend extra time on the assignments, etc etc.\n\nThe arrogant 'My Mom said I should be a programmer because I got the printer to work' types will shut up real fast once they realize they don't know anything...but I found them to be a much smaller issue than the arrogant students who were actually really good students.",
            "Hmm. I took a some CS courses in community college. Nobody seemed to want to speak. I almost wish there were some unruly people being vocal in the class. It was embarrassing when the instructor would ask a question and everybody was trying to hide.\n\nI do remember back at my 4-year college, taking a physics course, and some dude thought he knew a lot and was pretty vocal. It was amusing. Some other students did not agree, and started yelling at him to STFU.",
            "Yup. Came into school for CS at 22 from the Marines. Definitely a different type of person than I was used to being around.",
            "The classes get harder and some students can\u2019t keep up so they change majors. This does decently well to weed out some of this behavior but it\u2019s generally the case that CS is for geeks because they\u2019re the only category of people who are told that this is for them. \n\nA good professor will be able to influence their students. For example, my Data Structures and Algorithms class (one of the first rather difficult roadblocks in the CS path) a student sat in the very front as close to the professor\u2019s podium as possible. He had an answer to every question that nearly always was more detailed than needed. The student would also often just blurt out an answer, hamstringing the rest of the students in their ability to contribute.\n\nAs a result the professor would often quietly and calmly interrupt the student and ask him to please raise his hand if he wants to respond. It\u2019s a good thing that the student wants to participate but the professor recognized that everyone should have a chance so he\u2019d often generally let students answer once and often ask for \u201cnew hands\u201d to allow other students who hadn\u2019t participated yet to do so. If no one new had a suggestion then he would allow the overachieving type to answer and refine his answer afterwards into something we could all understand.\n\nIt seems to me like someone like that may have some condition of ADHD or autism or something being that he was unable to grasp the social queues given by the context of the professor not choosing him as frequently as the student may have liked but the professor did well to handle the situation appropriately. I think this is absolutely key. \n\nSo yeah it definitely gets better as you get deeper. Freshman students are figuring out if this is really for them and forming social bonds through humor or references is one way that this can be done. More experienced students are more solid in their ability to behave appropriately but at the same time CS is just a nerdy industry so it may be worth getting used to the idea that the majority will probably always be rather nerdy. It\u2019s just that students mature over time and can still be nerdy but not so rude.\n\nThis seems like a \u201cthese students are freshman\u201d problem rather than a CS problem imo",
            "I'm an old man, went back in my late 30's to get my CompSci degree and I luckily saw none of this. Everyone was on the up and up and mostly, not overly nerdy to the point where you want to punch someone.",
            "This is very true even after 5 years. I stopped trying to socialize with people in this major except a small group of friend i made the first year, which most of them actually stopped studying cs and moved to a totally different field.\n\nI stopped going to lecture, did the assignments and went to exams and went on with my life",
            "It\u2019s true in the workplace as well. Run if you\u2019re normal",
            "Honestly, it's going to vary a little depending on your school. Try finding upper division courses, and pop in to just listen during the lecture / audit the course a couple of times throughout the semester. Vibes absolutely will change as grades hit",
            "Those are the guys that are either geniuses with no social skills, or think they're geniuses, also with no social skills",
            "It's the quietest people who are the best. I should know, I made friends with all of the top programmers of my year (not necessarily the best grades but most ambition outside of class) and they all for the most part sat aside while the others were yapping about. Hoping the situation is more clean this next year, I start 2nd year in a couple weeks :)",
            "It doesn\u2019t stop\u2026 did an internship this summer and some of the SWE interns had no filter, no social awareness or EQ, and absolutely couldn\u2019t carry on a conversation. Felt like I was living in a TikTok with their attention spans. Starting to realize how big social skills are in the work place and just in a public setting (like a classroom) in general, very much needed and I think COVID + TikTok (social media in general) really has thrown a wrench into that.",

            "First off, congrats on your journey. Secondly, I\u2019m sorry because CS brings in a broad range of people. I graduated with a CS degree in 2021, and I definitely met people from \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be here\u201d to \u201cI have a server in my apartment to host applications\u201d to talking in memes and cringe.

            "Of course, what did you expect? Engineering and CS in general attract social rejects, coding in your room all day is not exactly something your average good looking neurotypical person is going to want to do. They go outside and socialize and get validation and have sex with girls",

            "Once you're in junior/senior year you will be surrounded by much more chill people. There might always be that one guy that's a complete weirdo, but for the most part majority are normal.

            "> I had heard the rumors but didn't think my CS class would feel like a literal Star Wars convention... please tell me these guys get weeded out pretty early lol \n\nNow from what I've experienced there's 2 types of these nerds: \n\nThe first one is the gamer, who thinks they are fit to study CS just because they sit on their computer and play video games all day. They get weeded out because they are usually dumb lazy bums with very surface level CS knowledge (enough to gloat in the first semester) and never expand on it.\n\nThen, however, there are the nerds who coded since they were 10 and are genuinely passionate about CS. They are also socially unaware and obnoxious, but they will always be better than you. \n\nFor my uni we lost about 70% of students along the way and most of them were gamers, weebs, or people who were in it solely for the money. I'd also say the remaining nerds got a bit calmer over time. So yes, it gets better. The distribution shifts so there are more normal people and the remaining nerds get less obnoxious.",
            "I'm happy this was never an issue at my college. Everyone in my class was normal for the most part. There were geeks but nothing cringe. Some people brought their gaming devices and played games between class. Other than that everything was normal.",
            "And this is why I attend online lol",

            "I had to take a single CS class for my associates and it's a different breed for sure. Lots of unkempt young dudes. Baggy clothing resting on chubby formless bodies, head hair sticking up, scraggly facial hair. \n\nOne guy wore the same Rick and Morty shirt every class we had (2x a week). We were doing a lab and something on his computer wasn't working correctly one time and he yelled \"god fucking DAMN IT!!!\" and slammed his fist on the keyboard, breaking the keyboard.",
            "It is like that, and honestly it was hard for me to make friends with many classmates in college. I would highly recommend making friends with non cs majors, even other engineers are lots of fun, I found it\u2019s almost exclusively cs majors for some reason.",
            "They get a lot better really fast or they drop. Most of the people I\u2019ve met in my upper levels in undergrad have been very professional and sociable people.",

            "I feel like while networking can be important, this is pretty unactionable advice especially given how socially inept some people are. So for my socially inept friends here is a guide.\n\nOption 1: Simple start messaging recruiters and cold calling companies. The tag line would look something like\n\nHi my name is X, I am a student at Y. I have some insert experience or projects example that is relevant to Z role. Would you be willing to have a quick chat about B role at your company?\n\nYou are really just playing the numbers. I haven't personally done this, but one of my friend swears by it and he works at Citadel now so...\n\nOption 2: Attend events and network for the long haul\n\nThe easiest referral you can get is from a friend. You wont feel awkward asking for a referral from someone you've known for a while. The best way to make friends in the same field are places like hackathons, CS student union, CS classes, maybe some sweaty LOG lobby, etc. You are making friends with people who don't currently have a job, but will in the future. The more people you meet, the more people you can get a referral from when inevitably one of them gets a job in the future.\n\nOne of the problems I've seen people mention is that they don't know how to stay relevant to these people. Example, they met at a hackathon once two years ago, but they don't think the person will remember them. This my friend is what LinkedIn posts and Instagram stories are for. You may not have talked to the person in a while, but if they still have you added and you post once a month or something, they'll probably remember you.\n\nEven if they don't, typically most people will just give you the benefit of the doubt.\n\nOption 3: Ask friends of friends\n\nThe most significant referrals a person can typically get are not primary connections, but secondary connections. So not your friend, but your friend's dad or something like that. Many people who go to university have professional parents working at mid to large sized companies. If you are friends with their moron of a son Jimmy, they will be willing to give a reference to Jimmy's friend (You).\n\nI hope this was insightful, now go forth and make friends. Like anime has taught you, friendship is magic or some shit.",
            "The reality is that the fundamental reason the hiring process exists is to increase the chance of hiring a trustworthy candidate - but if you are already someone that is trusted (by someone internally) then your odds of bypassing part of the hiring process go way up.

If you wouldn't care about somebody (any more than anyone else) if they weren't doing something for you (besides being friends), then that's not a friend.

It's more important to find people that share a common interest. Then it's just about communicating and connecting on that topic. I call this \"making friends\". The more curious you are about things the more friends you'll make. This is the beginning of building a network.\n\nThe problem is a lot of people want to see results right away. That's not the way a network works. Building a community trusted peers takes time but ultimately will result in the best types of work. Like 80% of the job openings are filled through the \"in-network\". Generally all the jobs that hit the job boards are the ones nobody else wanted, or they couldn't fill for some reason.\n\nMy recommendation is don't waste time going to random networking events that \"suck\", instead read up on things that interest you and look for names of people working those projects. Then go find their LinkedIn profile or the profiles of people working on those projects. Make connections with them. At least they'll be meaningful relationships that get you closer to what you want. Also they'll be able to help guide you on learning the kinds of things that are valuable to their company.",

I guess this post was needed after reading so many on how CS majors are not getting jobs and that the field is dead.",

If you can actually hold yourself together in an interview and appear personable, then you\u2019d do much better than be a mediocre dev that\u2019s good at networking. I\u2019d bet good money that the people complaining about not finding a job aren\u2019t the best devs.",
            "Yes and no. It all depends on how centralized a company's university recruiting process is. For large tech companies like google, a close family friend L8 principal engineer that you've known since childhood has no pull in getting you through the resume screen any more than your L3 new grad classmate who just started yesterday. Both will simply fill out that they had a close working relationship with you on the referral form and thats the end of it. What can help is if you have an inside connect to the university recruiters, but they get hundreds of messages a day and its far from a guarantee that you will contact the one among the dozens/hundreds of them who will handle your resume. For these companies its best to get a referral from anyone and be done with it.\n\nFor some smaller companies without hyper centralized university recruiting teams, networking can help. But for the elite ones, you will still need to get past a certain resume bar that is higher than traditional big tech anyways. For some random no name company in the midwest? Sure networking can help you with a mid resume get past the resume screen\n\nTLDR: For almost all F500 and other large companies networking won't help as the process for their swe/IT department university recruiting is WAY too centralized. For some smaller companies, sure it can help but its not going to get you into smaller elite unicorns without an elite resume to back it up.",

Well guess what\u2026\n\nI recently applied for a TikTok internship because I really liked their product and was interested to learn more about the technical challenges they are facing while growing so quickly. I have a good CV with great grades from a top university and multiple projects and work experience. \n\nHowever, I really wanted to stand out from other applicants because working at TikTok was a dream of mine for a while.\n\nAt the beginning of the summer I decided to start a project that is related to TikTok in some way. I thought it would be a great way to show my dedication. \n\nI spent several months building a mobile app which enables TikTok users to see detailed analytics about their follower engagement and track who unfollowed them etc. I published the app on the app store and mentioned it in my CV. There I explained my motivation behind it, the tech stack that I used and included a link to the app store listing.\n\nOn the very next day I did not only receive a rejection, but also a trademark infringement complaint from TikTok asking me to remove the app from the app store. Reason for this being that my app uses the word \u201cTok\u201d in its name.\n\nI guess I should have just grinded leetcode over the summer\u2026",

Ya, you will feel disappointed but they are not doing wrong on this matter (except the Tok part on your app name, unless your app is named as TakTok or something that is very similar to TikTok.) \n\nI think major social network service providers stated in their T&C that no data scraping is allowed on their user data on the platform,  you did that and you let them know right in front of their face. So... \n\nI am by no mean work under them or a professional in legal. But, the thing that you learn from developing the app will be yours, so not a total loss.",

            "For those of you that asked about the techstack: As you can imagine, some of these scraping tasks can take a lot of time. Sometimes up to 20 seconds depending on the size of the profile. Therefore I have multiple containers deployed that pick up the processing tasks from a message queue and run it asynchonously in the background. \nThe app communicates with a main webserver written in python (FastAPI) and checks if the user exists on TikTok etc. If that is the case, the webserver creates an entry in a database (Firestore) and writes a message to the queue for the other workers to pick up. This way the latency for the user is minimal. I also have another container deployed that updates the entry in the database and sends push notifications to the users if someone has unfollowed them (Cloud Function written in Python). This function is executed once every day by a cloud scheduler and also deletes profiles if there are no longer on TikTok. \nI tried to make sure that the app can scale easily if needed by queueing the scraping tasks and handling them asynchronously. For the scrapping I wont go into the details. You will obviously need a rotating proxy network and handle all kinds of errors.\n\nEdit: The app itself is made with Flutter",
