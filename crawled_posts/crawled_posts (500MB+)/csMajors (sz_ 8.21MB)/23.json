I want you to order the project ideas from simple to complex and you must provide the estimated implementation time of each project>.\n\nThat usually does the trick.\n\nYou will gain more insight on how your simple projects has a big impact. \nNext step is - do not directly put the project name in your resume/cv, Use the fancy real world value added project. Again, take help from LLMs.\n\nHope this helps.",
            "I understand your sentiment, but you might be missing the point of what the recruiter is trying to tell you. Only a gifted and/or lucky few have the talent and resources to make something as an entry-level dev that compares to an enterprise or FOSS app. That being said, there's a huge difference between creating an app exactly the way it's been done a million times versus changing it up to be unique.\n\nWhen you're creating just a simple TODO web app that runs on localhost and nothing more, it's very easy to just copy everything from a tutorial or worse from someone else's code without actually having learned anything. But if you were to take that TODO app, host it on a cloud server, and synchronize it between a web app, desktop app, and mobile app, now you're talking about something that's both more advanced and more unique than the standard TODO. Bonus points if you add in some unique features. You don't have to host the app or make it an official app that others can use, though if you can then that's even better.\n\nThe point is don't just do a straight up run-of-the-mill app. Either come up with a relatively unique idea or else spice up the run-of-the-mill idea so that it's more unique and requires more skill and effort on your part. If you can create something that others can use and contribute to, even if it's a very simple idea, makes a huge difference.",

            "   He is right but his response is kinda misleading a little bit. He's right that you should create something close to real world scenario project, not todo app .\n\n However, the following phrase \" Choosing a tool that already exists without innovating\" what's exactly the meaning of it? Does he expect from you as a junior to create something remarkable on the job? And the most important question, if you indeed will be able to perform that, would he raise your salary? So junior should push the limits and perform like medior, but with the salary of junior? That's doesn't make any sense.",
            "Don't listen to these dumb dumbs. Doing tutorial apps is how you get started. It shows you can learn and stay motivated. Of course, you should add unique elements to them and avoid copying and pasting, and actually learn what it is you're doing and why. Then, when you put the project on your resume, list what you learned from doing it. Specifically, things that are useful to an employer.\n\nMy first project was a d&d web tool I built using knowledge I learned from a Vue tutorial. It was not top of the line or better than the competitors in any way, but my employer said it showed that I could sit down start to finish and build something. Then, when they hired me, my first task was to complete a tutorial project for Angular so I could familiarize myself with their tech stack before diving in. This is actually a very common onboarding practice and a useful skill to have.",

I mean, Burntsushi did, but you can\u2019t be compared to Burntsushi. \n\nBuild tools that are simple, be able to explain why you built that tool and the problem it solves, and how you\u2019d iterate on it.

Some game demo via Unity/Unreal where they followed some tutorials and they didn\u2019t add anything of their own. These don\u2019t get much attention.\n\nSometimes I get a small but a unique demo. A new rendering approach, an interesting shader, or a feature like volumetric fog, some interesting character mechanic etc\u2026 And almost always these are not even big things, just a demo of a specific interesting feature that I have not seen before. \n\nI also get occasionally big group student projects.

However, I got into the TTRPG known as Lancer a while ago and QUICKLY realized just how fast my game notes got chaotic and disorganized.\n\nSo I wrote a system to fix that. Made an MVP as a Notion template and sold over 100 licenses. I'm currently working on migrating it to a full SaaS app.\n\nI got annoyed trying to write a CTF solver with Selenium, so I straight up wrote a library to make browser-based exploits easier. One of my colleagues I was working with at the time was really really into it, and I want to get back into maintaining it so I can make it better.\n\nFind what frustrates you, that you can't find a solution for elsewhere, and you'll naturally build something unique.",

I'm not  a hiring manager and am still in school as a mature student so I won't pretend to offer job advice, but a response like this will put people off. On reddit it's not a big deal, but if you responded like that in real life the hiring manager might end up remembering you as someone who shuts down completely at reasonable advice to throw a pity party.\n\nI understand your instinct, I've done it myself. There's a misleading sense of comfort to hearing something difficult and responding with \"oh, then I'm just the worst ever, I'm dumb and terrible and I was kidding myself when I thought I could do this, in order to succeed I would have to be a better person, so I guess its impossible\". I get it. But its not true, and most importantly  not helpful.\n\nYou gotta put some distance between you and the problem, maybe consider the advice if it were given to someone else if that helps you not shut down. The manager is not saying you have to make a competitive product and they are not saying the projects you suggested are not worth doing. They are just saying they are not great resume projects (which is different from saying they are not good learning projects). They are saying that a good resume project does something different that current products don't do (again, it doesn't have to be competitive, it just has to solve a slightly different problem even if the problem difference is just \"I want something like product x but it also let's me do y), or it contributes to something that exists (I.e. find something open source and try contributing)",

In reality you do not reinvent the wheel when there is no need or improvement.

If you want geberate revenue with something others already, provide you must know what your unique selling points are or how you plan to get some of the market share despite not being much different.\n\nIn your case, even for your project in the README as a lab/personal learning project it would be nice to first summarize what your expectations and goals are/were, what you ecountered and learned and what you could do better or as he says what you did different to other solutions.\n\nI would say if you can do that it shows good practice, reflection and the ability to research and formulate a task and track your progress.",
            "I think you misconstrued what the recruiter is trying to say.\n\nThey're trying to say that being original and coming up with a new tool is more impressive than following what is already established. They did not mention anything about the 'quality' of the product, but your response seem to tunnel into that.\n\nAnd if you look at it this way, I am sure you will agree as well. For example, I can follow a Youtube tutorial and make chess from scratch. Is the act of making a complex game like chess by yourself impressive in a vacuum? Yes. Do you need to have knowledge to make it function properly? Yes. But does knowing that there are tutorials on Youtube change your perception of the project? Also yes.\n\nI don't know the context behind the recruiter's comment and whether they're referring to your personal project or in general, but if your project is the result of well documented methods for achieving the same results, I would have the same sentiment as the recruiter. It suggests that you make 'easy' projects to put on your resume, they are essentially resume fluff and reflect negatively on your profile.",
            "You have many technical answers here like \"make an app controling a machine via IIoT\". OK, crazy. My approach would be completely different, including a business point of view. You can think about \"What businessmen/companies around me need\"? You can ask friends, even family. You can ask your mom: \"Hey, mom, what app would really help you but does not exist\" (or exists but does not work well)? With this approach you will maybe not boast with something technically crazy but you will show you know something about real life, business and that makes you stand out as potential future manager, not just a cog in a corporate machine. During one interview, they asked me: how many real users does your app/website have? How does it help to the end-users?",
            "Pretty sure they\u2019re saying to make something that at least tries to improve on the currently available, even if it only applies to you. My personal projects apply to things that help me or would help me and fit my needs, or at least have a unique gimmick compared to existing apps.",
            "What he\u2019s saying is correct, and your response was childish. \n\nHe\u2019s saying to make projects that require problem solving, and actual thought to them. Not some easily searchable tutorial project that you can throw on your resume. I recommend picking a hobby of yours and trying to think of a way an app/ a tool could help you enjoy that hobby more, and build it from scratch.",
            "Sounds like a skill issue to me",
            "my takeaway from that is don't use school projects in your resume unless there are original aspects to it. Like if every student in the program did something similar what's the point of having that on the resume its the same as writing I graduated from x school with a undergrad. Side projects don't have to be all original code but it should demonstrate your problem solving ability on your own. What i mean by this is your side project shouldn't be following instructions. But i get it. It kind of sounded like the recruited wanted you to build something completely original when that is most likely not the case.",
            "As people have said your attitude is horrible. But as far as the content goes I agree if we're talking about an entry level job. It's pretty ridiculous to expect innovative projects just for a shot at an entry level job. But that's just how it is when there's a lot of competition.",

            "Welp.  That's depressing.  Studying this has been the worst decision in my life.",
            "I'm not CS (EE), but are projects really worth a damn? Anyone can put any project on their resume. There are also a ton of online resources to guide you through a project. I don't feel like it does anything to help you stand out amongst hundreds of other grads",
            "They\u2019re completely right though.\u00a0Nobody cares if you can do what lost of other people can do. That\u2019s not impressive, regardless of your jr level. They\u2019re only interested in hiring the very best candidate, so you need to do something to stand out.\n\nThe sarcasm really wasn\u2019t helpful. You could have just asked them to give some examples.",
            "Sounds like the guy is saying. You should have a purpose for why you are building the project and not just build the same stuff. From my experience people care more if the project you are building is to solve your personal problem. That way it doesn't even matter how complex it is."

        "selftext": "So I went through the lovely recruitment process for a software engineer new grad with Visa Inc. this year. Applied in October, aced the code signal, and they requested a first-round interview. I gave my availability for the next 7 days. 5 days go by nothing. I reached out and got a message a day later saying they're trying to schedule ASAP and ask for additional availability for the next week.\n\nThen before I can even reply I get an email from the lead recruiter giving a time for an interview the next day in the morning. The interview went well. Then nothing for 2 weeks, At this time I got another offer and informed Visa of said deadline.\n\nThen finally after another week and a half, almost a month since my first interview. I got an invitation to a final round, and the recruiter asked me to get a week and a half extension for my offer. Which I then did.\n\nFinal interview time, I'm talking to my potential future manager going great. In the end, he asked me about any offers and I explained. He basically said, \"I think you'd be a great fit, our recruitment processes have improved a lot and we should be able to get an offer in front of you before your deadline and I hope you sign it. I look forward to you joining the team\".\n\nSo of course I'm ecstatic. Then the next day my recruiter reached out and asked me to get another couple-day extension in addition because \"we need till the end of the week to confirm results\". I'm somewhat sussed out but I ask and somehow get the extension anyway.\n\nI was told I'd get an update this morning. The morning of the day my other offer was due. I waited patiently as the morning rolled past. Nothing. Around 2 pm I emailed the recruiter to check in \"Well have an update by the afternoon\" they replied. Fast forward, now it is 8 pm my time. Left with basically no choice, I send another email asking whether or not I'll get a decision today. 4 minutes later an automated rejection email from Visa hits my inbox. All I can say is what the fuck. Like not even the recruiter reaching out with a rejection. After I was told in everything but print I was hired and extended an offer deadline twice. Like why couldn't they have rejected me a week ago?\n\nI don't even know what to do anymore tbh.\n\n&#x200B;",

            "Never assume you have the offer until it is in your inbox. With that being said, super scummy stuff by them by leading you on for so long.",
            "I\u2019m pretty sure the Visa hiring manager decided to keep you hanging while they are screening other applicants. You are VERY good, but STILL not good enough for them to not want an even better candidate. I always pressure the employer to either offer before my other deadline or I will withdraw, tbh.\n\nThe way visa behaved is unprofessional (usually they inform me implicitly - I can read between the lines - or explicitly that they are still shopping despite I am the top candidate so far that has finished the whole loop), but I\u2019m also surprised that the other company extended your deadline TWICE - you were already playing with fire at the 2nd extension. If I\u2019m hiring, no way I\u2019d extend a 3rd time - no new grad is THAT good.\n\nAlways remember: An offer dragging its feet is not worth an offer already in your hand. I would just sign the offer in hand, and if Visa really gave a much better offer, back out of the former one, if I decide the bridge is not worth keeping. Was the other company that much worse than Visa?! such that you\u2019d drag them on without accepting? Now that they\u2019ve canceled on the 3rd extension request, the bridge has clearly been burnt anyway.\n\nEdit: I misunderstood; it\u2019s Visa who rejected, not the original offer company. But still, don\u2019t hesitate to sign an already extended offer for an offer dragging its feet, as explained above.",
            "I don't get why you extend offers TWICE. Accept the damn offer and if VISA comes through just go over there. There is 0 logic in extending offers like that",
            "Made it to the last interview at Comcast for their SWE internship last year... interviewer said I did amazing, was excited to work with me, and should be expecting an offer within the next week. 2 weeks go by, I email the recruiter, and she said I was no longer being considered for the role. Absolutely sucks. It was right before Christmas also, I was so excited to tell my family about it.",

            "The company that gave you two extensions sounds like a great place to work lul",
            "Here\u2019s something I\u2019ve noticed: if you have an offer deadline, you can tell them about it, but don\u2019t ever push them to make a decision\u2026 because then you are making it like a deadline for them too. Companies would rather miss out on a good hire than hire a bad employee or hire if they aren\u2019t ready for some other reason.\n\nI\u2019ve been in this situation before too, and made this same mistake last year.\n\nI think next time if you are in this situation, accept the competing offer, and just wait for the recruiter to get back on their own time. If you do end up getting an offer then you can think about whether it is worth reneging for.",

            "This happened to me years ago with Visa Inc. I went through 3 rounds of interviews, and at the final round, everything (seemed to me, at least) went well. As a matter of fact, the hiring manager even brought me around the office to meet the other members of her team - who would be my immediate colleagues. Then silence. I sent emails, and I even phoned the recruiter. No response. I didn't even receive a rejection email. No idea what happened there.",

        "selftext": "Go enjoy your life. Get off this sub. You are valuable, talented individuals and will certainly have a successful career without selling your soul to this endless rat race propagated by so many here.          \n\n  \nYou don\u2019t need to start learning algorithms and leetcode immediately. You can actually enjoy your first year at college instead. Go make friends, play sports, try out a ton of clubs, pick up an instrument, experience your school\u2019s traditions, **live your life**. There is so much more to your college experience than internships, despite what some on this sub would say.           \n\nThis post isn\u2019t attempting to discredit the value an internship can bring to your career prospects. You certainly should try to get one! However, you don\u2019t have to start interview prepping the minute you step on campus. For me, I just enjoyed freshmen year. Sure I applied to a few first year places - totally bombed a Microsoft interview lol - but certainly I never spent more than a few hours total interview prepping and working on my CV that first year. I got an internship 3 weeks before the summer started with a no-name government contractor in my hometown by networking around when I visited home. I originally was just going to study abroad but ya know, COVID. If anything, that internship was a glorified EE internship - pretty much no programming. But it was experience, and valuable experience at that which I didn\u2019t need any leetcode for.            \n\nStarting sophomore year, I took internship hunting a lot more serious. Learned Leetcode, applied to a billion places, etc, and had far better results. However, I did not accomplish those results by spending all my time interview prepping freshmen year. To be blunt, you don\u2019t really need to. I don\u2019t think I could have even learned much leetcode until after I took Data Structures and Algo\u2019s, and I didn\u2019t do that until second semester freshmen year.            \n\nI cannot imagine what my life would be like right now if I had not taken time to enjoy freshmen year to the max I could. I would not have the friends I have right now, I would not have met my gf, I would have lost so many valuable memories and experiences. Freshmen year is special - in my experience, it\u2019s true that the friends you make your first year will be your friends for the rest of your time at college. So please, don\u2019t be a leetcode hobbit who sits in their room all day doing nothing but worrying about internships and their career. Go have fun :) there will be time for this stuff later.            \n\n.          \n\nEdit: a few people have been replying and saying that they think this post is encouraging freshmen to slack off or not care about their careers. I hope I didn't come across that way as that was not my intention. My main point is merely this: **don't feel pressured to spend all of your time interview prepping as a freshmen; instead focus on classes and life.** If you want to interview prep, that is totally cool and good for you! Just don't obsess over it or let people convince you that grinding is absolutely essential for freshmen to have any chance at success.",

I watched as literal geniuses 10 years younger than me flunked out or changed degrees simply because they didn't do the work.

Apply to at least 10 places a day, and get dat foyst jobby.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, I fucking party harder and more than I ever have in college now that I have a job lol.",
            "While I would agree with the general spirit of your post, I also think that it's easier to absorb a lot of information spread evenly over 4 years than over a mad rush in the last year.\n\n>You don\u2019t need to start learning algorithms and leetcode immediately.\n\nLeetCode doesnt have to be 'bad'. It can actually be quite fun. The majority of people that are burnt out on this sub try to pack way too much into a too short timeframe. They want to find a job NOW but in reality they have one year of self-study ahead of them before that can happen.\n\nAlso, the benefit of internships cannot be overstated. And for that its worth getting a few projects done over the first couple years to beef up the resume for the junior year internship and use that to get an even better internship\n\nMy argument is not to NOT enjoy freshman year, it;s that if someone works 'smart' a a little bit each week, you can spread the work over a better period, remove a lot of the stress, and enjoy all FOUR years instead of just the first one.\n\nSo I think its worth thinking of the 4 years as 'its a marathon, its not a sprint'. Even a 30-mile mile hike can be somewhat pleasant if you run very slowly, or even walk parts of it - or even better, run it in 4 chunks over a few weekends. However the same hike starts to be really shitty if you have to start and end it on the same day.",
            "This is great post-pandemic advice but a ton of students are stuck at home with not much else to do; might as well grind at that point. As soon as I get back on campus though the foot is coming off the gas.",
            "Yes!  So much yes!  Don't waste your college years grinding Leetcode just for FAANG.  Enjoy this time.  Take interesting classes (even if they're not CS classes - I personally love philosophy).  Join a cool club.  Pursue internships that interest you.  Get involved in research.  Explore your local area (when COVID is over, at least).  Go camping or skydiving or snorkeling or whatever it is you've always wanted to do.  Attend campus activities.  Have a little fun!\n\nI'd also like to add onto this that CS is *so much more* than just generic software engineering.  Software engineering is great if that's what you want to do.  But you don't have to limit yourself to just grinding Leetcode and DSA problems to work as a software engineer.  There are more career options out there.  You can work in cybersecurity, machine learning, data science, game dev, robotics, embedded systems, or IT.  You can develop compilers or operating systems or design programming languages.  You can get into CS theory if you really want.  There's more to do this just Leetcode to become a full-stack developer.\n\nAdditionally, there are more ways to get a job (even a software engineering job) than just Leetcode.  Often times, who you know and how you sell yourself are *way* more important than anything else.  Spend time brushing up your resume.  Work on cool personal projects.  Make a personal website or blog (also great for improving and demonstrating your communication skills, which are very important too).  Go to some local meet-ups or user groups and get to know professionals in your area.  This will help you so much more than grinding Leetcode, and it's a lot more fun.",

            "I'd be enjoying myself coming from \\[Georgia Tech | MIT | Caltech\\]. You know, I understand your standpoint, but, judging from your post, you seem to be talking from a privileged position.\n\nHonestly, 4 years are not even enough to finish building your resume and targeting good career prospects post-college.\n\nAnd I disagree with you on being a Leetcode hobbit and not having friends. Buddy, I have loads of friends that I still hold from my first year. I get wasted at least once every two weeks (as a good undergrad). I allot myself leisure time every day (this month only I finished GoT and Mr. Robot). I exercise every single day. I have a girlfriend and we spend most of the week together; we go to the movies very often.\n\nI landed three internships this year: Google, Lyft, and Odoo. Guess how? Grinding every single day.\n\nI agree with you on one part: leisure time is essential to survival. I disagree with you on doing it for an entire year.\n\nFrom here I'ma get all Plato on you. But I believe that life consists of ease and thrust movements. Push, rest, repeat (I'll probably write a book someday).\n\nSpecifically for internships, most of the time the outcome is unpredictable. I believe that landing a job at a FAANG, or any company for that matter, is comprised of a multifactored formula: right timing + preparation + luck. From those 3 factors, the only one you can control at will is **preparation**. I'm not trying to get all Tony Robbins on you, but more in a mathematical approach. The other factor you can pseudo-control with probability is **luck**. The interviewer did not like you, you had to solve a problem from a topic you did not study well, or they just simply did not read your resume; all of that has happened to me, and it sure sucks.\n\nBut let me ask you, what happens if you repeat that process a gazillion times? I don't know if you remember from your probabilistic subject, but if you throw 2 dices enough times, you'll end up having a Gauss distribution, whether you expect it or not.\n\nYo, don't do anything if you don't want to. If you're happy with your life, be my guest. I'm not trying to convince you, life is not black/white. You can be a fucking Leetcode hobbit and enjoy your life. If you want to do amazing things in life, you need to grind, whatever that means to you.",

You can live your life, hang out with friends, go to the gym and practice Leetcode at the same time.\n\nFreshmen have more free time since their classes are easier, and Leetcode improves their understanding of the fundamentals. On top of that, since they would be starting early they would have to put less time every day, so it's really not as bad as it seems. \n\nAlso, you seem to be forgetting that with remote schooling, the freshman year experience for this year is much more different than yours.\n\n\"Go make friends, play sports, try out a ton of clubs, pick up an instrument, experience your school\u2019s traditions, live your life\".

            "I feel like a /r/csmajors firefighter. The amount of panic here, lol, at least it's entertaining, and that's what keeps me coming back.\n\nThis number is completely bogus and has no bearing on your chances. That's because you need to apply directly through the company, and preferably with an internal referral or a reach out from a recruiter.\n\nThis hasn't changed. It was the case years back as well. And not that it even matters, but what's your baseline on all this? What were the application numbers a year ago or two years ago? Probably smaller, but the fact that you don't know makes this meaningless.",

It's just not worth their time. Even if he's unemployed. \n\nWhat's actually happening is that 95% of these applications are fake from foreign countries or just bots. \n\nIf you want to get noticed use what you have as an advantage. Apply at job fairs in person or with references of other classmates. \n\nBasically none of these applications are ever looked at, why would I risk my chances on anyone in this pool when I have applications with references to current employees.",

The 50th person has a better shot of getting an interview and actually getting the job.\n\nThe reason? Because hiring has a cost. It takes time and money to interview every candidate. Its better to just find the first good candidate than wasting time and money finding the absolute best.\n\nThis is actually a pretty common algorithms example known as the [hiring problem](https://www.bartleby.com/subject/engineering/computer-science/concepts/hiring-problem).",

            "This is painful to see. I have been through the same recently. Had 3 years of hands on, FS development experience and still, applied for over 300 positions to get back nothing but automated rejection emails. Fast forward to today, I\u2019m working as a FS Engineer L2 at a unicorn. Here\u2019s what I would try if I was in your shoes rn:\n\n1. Apply through third-party recruitment firms - this helps a lot in securing initial rounds of interviews.\n\n2. Look for hiring events happening at nearby educational institutions and connect directly with recruiters. They usually have 3-4 positions ready to recruit for.\n\n3. Look for managers using LI for the role you want to apply for. The senior engineers (in my case) are too busy to help you with referrals. Managers have been the most responsive in my scenario.\n\n4. Sounds weird but use dating apps to get referrals from people working senior positions in the role you want to apply for. These people are always ready to talk and socialize. I managed to get referrals for big techs via this.\n\nHope this advice helps someone out to land their next job!",
