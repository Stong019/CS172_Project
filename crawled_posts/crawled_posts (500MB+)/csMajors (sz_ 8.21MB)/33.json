        "selftext": "Hey!\n\nSo I spend some time over at /r/cscareerquestions and I've been seeing a lot of resumes for new grads that are basically empty. They just have a projects section which has their homework projects from various classes listed. Its really concerning to see that CS students seem to just go to class and take tests.\n\nSo I just wanted to raise some awareness and let you know about all the options you have available to you *while* you are a student, so that you can take advantage of them and graduate with a resume that will get a lot of callbacks. **Once you graduate you will no longer have access to these, so make sure to do it while you are still in school.**\n\nAs a student at a university pursuing CS, you can participate in the following:\n\n* **Lab Volunteering**: Most CS labs need student volunteers to do various technical things. Once you get to know your professors, you can ask to volunteer at their lab if you are interested in their research. You can usually turn this into a paid research assistant position very easily since professors always need research assistants.\n\n* **Research Assistantships**: At most schools, if you get to know your professors well, you can get yourself research assistant positions at their lab and work for them. It's usually available to undergraduates and often a paid position, but this will vary from school to school. It's a great opportunity to learn a lot about a specific niche of computer science (depending on what the professors research is in), and a great experience to put down on your resume.\n\n\n* **Teaching Assistant/Tutoring:** It's usually available to MS students, but some universities allow undergraduates to be TAs as well so you should definitely ask around. You can also get a job as a tutor for specific classes, so look into that for your university. Being a TA or tutor for your beginner CS course from freshman year is a great experience to put down on your resume.\n\n* **Co-Ops**: Most universities should have some Co-Op program for CS students. They are usually overseen by a professor and your engineering/department advisor will have leads. At my school, you would get credits for doing a co-op so instead of doing 2 electives you had the option to do 1 co-op and get 6 credits for it. Definitely do it if offered by your university!\n\n* **Internships**: The majority of internships are available to degree-seeking students exclusively. I don't really need to explain how important internships are. Your university might have a program to match you to internships or might have career fairs where companies come in and directly recruit students into internships. All of the above experience will pad your resume enough to make you desirable for internship recruiters. Someone who's resume only has homework projects will get passed on for someone who has a research experience, was a tutor, or volunteered at a professor's lab.\n\n* **Clubs/Orgs**: Most universities' engineering departments will have chapters of various CS focused orgs (IEEE-CS, ACM, MSDN, etc.). Volunteering at them as an officer can be a great experience, and they often have engineers from various tech firms within their network come in and give talks, and it also serves as an opportunity to network with these companies and get your resume directly passed to their recruiters.\n\n* **Hackathons/Programming Competitions**: The orgs or CS focused clubs mentioned above will usually host programming competitions and hackathons at your school. There usually also are larger state-level competitions with multiple universities participating, depending on your area. You can grab some of your friends and participate in them. Getting top 3 at a hackathon or competition is more impressive on a resume than making the Dean's List.\n\n* **Networking**: This one isn't as corporate as it sounds. Just be friendly with all your classmates and you'll naturally become friends. Make connections with your classmates, co-volunteers, your professors, and advisors too. You're going to make some of your best friends in college, and they will go on to work at great companies too. I can basically skip to the phone interview at any of the companies my friends work at through a referral. I can reach out to my old professors and get referral letters very easily if I decide to pursue a MS or PhD. Don't be a loner, software engineering is a team sport!\n\n\n\nSo basically, if all you are planning to do during your BS in CS degree is go to class, study, and take exams: it's not worth it and you will have a rough time getting that first new grad job. When you are paying for a degree, you are paying for access to all these things which ensure that when you graduate, you have a lot of collective experience and are a much more desirable candidate than your peers who have whitespace resumes. Most of your internships will also turn into a full-time offer if you perform well, so you can have guaranteed employment upon graduation.\n\nI didn't go a big tech school, just a public school in Florida where FAANG didn't even recruit from directly. I worked part time throughout college as a math tutor and then a tutor for the intro CS courses. I was vice-president of our local IEEE-CS chapter and organized a lot of events and workshops for all the members. I participated in most of the hackathons and programming competitions my school had and even did a statewide competition. In my sophomore year, I started volunteering at one of my professor's lab which did AI research, and eventually got hired as a research assistant junior year. Through my engineering advisor and another professor who I knew, I joined a co-op program where I built software for a local company. Through the career fair on campus I secured an internship, and received a return offer afterwards. I graduated with a 3.4 GPA but that didn't matter.\n\nI'm not saying you have to go and do all of these, but you should try to do 1 or 2 of them just to learn more and for the fact that it will make your life easier.\n\nI hope all this information will inspire to do things other than going to class and taking tests, and lead to me seeing more impressive new grad resume's on the resume review threads!",

            "I knew too many people who had a 4.0 GPA and nothing else and had so much trouble finding internships, while I and other friends had 2.5-3.5 GPAs and were landing interviews left and right (yes, I know people working at FAANG tier companies from my university who graduated with 2.5 GPAs). Grades aren't everything and in CS especially, the skills that make people do well in classes (lower level languages and outdated frameworks, memorization for exams, being able to remember and replicate stuff on your own) are completely opposite from the skills employers want in interns/new grads (more up to date tech, being able to Google & Stack Overflow your issues, working in teams and communicating well) and all the stuff in this post helps with that 2nd set of skills that actually adds employability to a CS major",
            "This is a great post and very well thought out. However, I bet a good chunk of people will read this, come away feeling guilty that they don't have the energy or drive to do these things, and feel like they are slipping behind. I want to remind people that it's completely fine if you just attend classes. CS programs are hard and being a full time student can be more demanding than a lot of jobs. Don't feel bad if you're not the type of person that wants to put in this amount of effort. Many people go into this field not particularly because it excites them but because it's a great career path. Those types of people attend classes, have fun with the rest of their time (it's college, enjoy yourself!), and get hired at decent companies that pay well. You don't have to live and breathe this stuff to be successful.",

This was a hard pill for me to swallow coming from a competitive high school, but I see too many CS students with a 3.9+ GPA and absolutely no experience. I feel bad because the professors seem to brainwash them into thinking their classes are everything, when in reality they should be focusing on projects and LC to become a CS student that stands out.\n\nYou are so much better off settling for a ~3.0 GPA and having killer projects/internships than trying your ass off for a max GPA. I've seen it too many times and they have trouble finding a new grad job",

            "This is great advice! I think a lot of students forget that they need a way to stand out from their peers after graduation considering how many new CS majors graduate each year. \n\nI started an internship the summer going into junior year, and I only got that opportunity because I asked one of my CS professors if she knew of any summer internships. I got super lucky in that I started my internship hunt literally 2 weeks before spring semester ended, and I got into the one she suggested last minute and worked there up until graduation (so 2 years experience ~20 hours per week, paid). My other CS professor asked me to be a lab assistant/tutor so I did that senior year too. That was only 4 hours a week over 2 semesters but still a great way to pad my resume!\n\nOther advice: form good relationships with your professors and take advantage of the career services office at your school!",
            "The first three are a waste of time for people not looking to go to grad school.  Being a teacher\u2019s assistant might be helpful, but that time is better spent making projects.\n\nClubs/orgs highly depends on the quality of the club.\n\nNetworking is generic advice.  \u201cOh I didn\u2019t know meeting other people would help me!  Crazy!\u201d",
            "Honestly this just isn't realistic for most students. I'm really busting my ass over here and barely scraping by with C's and maybe B's. If I tried to pile any of that on top of my course load I would just fail all of my classes.",
            "I can't understate how useful it is to be a TA!\n\nRemember all those concepts in first year which you were a little shaky on? \n\nWell you'll know them inside out by the time you've explained them the 100th time to a first year during your work as a TA!\n\nAlso ever had those issues during 3rd year or 4th year when suddenly the lecturer is calling back a concept from 1st year that they're now going to build upon? Well you'll remember it perfectly and know it rock solid, as you were just earlier that morning explaining it to a first year!

        "selftext": "I did it fam.\n\nI got a full-time offer for when I graduate.\n\nJob details: Data Scientist, 120k, MCOL\n \nSchool: no name state school, not even a top school for cs in my state, state is ranked poorly for education, 3.5 GPA\n\nFor those who are still planning for graduation, I've written this with you in mind so that you can find some value in it.\n\nI believe the first step that seeded my current momentum, was a senior project I worked on this Spring. It was a group project. Since I had no professional experience, I wanted to get my group to adopt a project that would look good to potential employers. I was fascinated with ChatGPT at the time, and it is a technology that many businesses are curious about right now, so I came up with an app idea we could build that utilized it, and sold my team on the idea.\n\nFrom there I lead the project and although I found my team unmotivated to really excel in the project, I went above and beyond and really turned it into something substantial. And because of how involved I was in it from every angle, I had a lot to talk about to potential employers. \n\nEnter my school's very modest career fair. I put the senior project on the top of my resume and made it a talking point at almost every single employer table I went to. One company had a recruiter who thought the project was interesting and knew a business unit who was exploring how to use the technology. This is what secured me my summer internship.\n\nAt my summer internship, I had one goal, by the time I was done at the end of the summer, I wanted to have created something that would have management saying, \u201cWow. We really need to hire this guy.\u201d Knowing I was skilled in making apps using OpenAI's suite of products, they gave me a really great summer project that I was able to play my strengths into and really excel in. I made sure to move fast and just do whatever I could to get as much results as I could in as quickly of a manner as I could during my 40 hours a week. By the end of the internship I had accomplished my goal. They wanted to extend my internship.\n\nFast forward a few months later and you might think that this is where my internship offers me full-time and the story ends, but that's not quite what happens. \n\nTime was dragging on and I still hadn't received an offer from my current company. They say they want me, but they're dragging their feet on the process. Unfortunately, I can't take that at face value. Things happen. So I had to continue searching for jobs. \n\nEnter my brilliant idea. My school's career fairs aren't that great, but I have a college with an awesome CS program just a couple hours away. I wonder if I can go to their career fair? I bet they have great companies that recruit from there. So I found out who organizes it and emailed them, and they said I'm more than welcome to attend! \n\nI arrived and did my usual networking with my new internship experience, and one company who is in a similar industry as my current employer ended up being impressed with my experience and resourcefulness in going out of my way to find opportunities, and invited me to interview for a competitive graduate program. \n\nI went a few weeks later to this interview and unfortunately, I was not selected\u2026. but while I was there, I really connected with one of the interviewers, a lead data scientist who has himself been fascinated with ChatGPT and the possibilities of generative AI. We had some great conversations about my experience and the possibilities on that frontier for their business. \n\nA couple weeks later, an internal recruiter for the company reached out to me saying, they wanted to hire me directly as a data scientist, working under the lead data scientist whom I had connected with over shared interests just a few weeks earlier\u2026 and the rest is history.\n\nI'm still waiting to see if my current company gives me an offer, but I honestly don't think it will be as competitive as the one I just got, plus I now have a great chip in negotiation if they do give me an offer.\n\nIn summary, here are the main things that I believe contributed to this outcome, and that you can use to your advantage as well: \n\n1. Learn an in demand and relevant technology \n\n2. Build a substantial project using it\n\n3. Make it a talking point in your resume in lieu of experience\n\n4. Go to your school's and other (better) schools\u2019 career fairs. Drive a few hours if you have to. Talk to as many employers as humanly possible.\n\n5. Get at least one internship and make it your goal to impress. Your goal in an internship should be to secure a return offer.\n\n6. While waiting for a return offer, or if you don't get one, use the internship experience as a stepping stone to other opportunities with companies in a similar industry.\n\n7. Be able to charm recruiters and decision makers (soft skills)\n\nSo yeah that's pretty much it. I didn't even bother to mention the hundreds of applications I sent in online, because truth is, they delivered 0 results for me. Everything that worked for me involved being face to face with people, with my boots on the ground.\n\nAnyways, thats it for the long ass post. I just wanted to share with you guys that new grads are getting hired, that you can do it too, and to convey what worked for me, so that it could help some of you too. I don't consider myself particularly smart, and I definitely don't go to an amazing school, so it definitely is possible. I did it, so you can too!\n\nMuch love everyone \u2764\ufe0f",

I\u2019ve seen these people irl, all they do is listen to the recruiter talk to a crowd and when they\u2019re finished they give the recruiter their printed resume which then gets added on to a pile of 50 others just like it.\n\nTALK TO PEOPLE! Putting a face to a name puts you leagues ahead of the competition and, just like in this story, random things can come from talking to people.

They bought a cheap second monitor and mirrored the screen and had 5-6 guys away from the camera. Further, they even have WhatsApp groups with easily 30-40 people where they send a pic of the problem, and the odds are really good that someone knows the answer. How do they know it? Because they practice leetcode and cheat. This is why them facing issues later  or getting \"found out\" in their career is not really true\n\nNgl it did make me wonder about what if I had just cheated and got an offer too because right now I have nothing. I feel there is a \"no matter what\" mentality that exists in at least Indian students, where pressures of loans, family, peers, etc contribute to this unjustifiable behavior.",

I don't give a hoot if you search Google or whatever for syntax (Lord knows I do,) but if you suddenly paste code in, that would generate a conversation.\n\nWhich is how we evaluate you, really.  It's not about the problem you're solving.  We don't care if you can solve it or not.  Honestly.  I know that's not how it's presented, but that is only the goalpost that we want to observe you trying to reach.\n\nWhat we care about, is what do you do when you're stuck?  What kind of questions do you ask?  Do you just sit their stupidly?  Do you get angry?  How do you try to resolve the problem?\n\nWhich is why it's stupid to try to cheat to solve them.  What kind of conversation are we going to have if you just super fast write the solution?  Even if you can defend every line of it?  It's like, woo, you've seen it before and memorized it.

Jobs can check your cert with a number against some database to ensure candidates have been validated at specific levels of technical literacy and ability. Not sure why this hasn't been done yet. It could be gamed too, but there's quite a bit more control and monitoring that could be put in place. Idk, I'd rather just go get certified than have to deal with hundreds of potential tech screenings.

Why re-invent the wheel? Being a good dev means being able to sift through all of the answers and finding GOOD code, instead of some shitty hacky kludge a low-skilled dev wrote.\n\nThat's just how this industry is. It's also why opensource code is so important. We thrive on sharing knowledge. Trying to suppress this natural instinct in new developers based on some personal bias formed from entitlement or bitternesss (I refer to your \" we work so hard grinding leetcode and these people STEAL our jobs? \" comment) is just absurd.\n\nDo we really want future developers to be afraid to reach out for help when they enter the workforce?  \n\n\nThe hard reality is, if young students are \"stealing\" jobs from you, you're probably not as \"leet\" as you think you are.",

I literally became an honors student while only studying like 10 hours for each subject the whole semester(other than HW) after realizing them\n\nThe first thing is that the gym doesnt have to take a lot of time. 3x per week each 45 minutes working out can build you a decent physique. and if you still think thats a lot of time, check your screen time.\n\nI even made something ive never seen in the fitness space before which is a huge mind map that has everything you need to know about the gym and has all the basic ideas of the gym. If anyone wants it they can comment or just send me a message\n\nThe second thing isactually focus when studying. Dont just look AT the slides. Actually think about them. Think about how each idea relates to the previous one.

Mostly just grabbed those slides, turned off all distractions (like other people ;)) and read.

I noticed much later how fast others (like my wife) go through fiction books.\nSo I analyzed my reading and found that I do read and visualize basically every single adjective, for example.\n\nBut then, some topics just vibe better with different kinds of people.\nI took a biochemistry class that everyone said would be so, so easy and some cheap credits.
