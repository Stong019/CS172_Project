        "selftext": "Message to all CS college students/new grads. Hi everyone just wanted to pop on here and say before I received this current summer internship I'm doing I could not get any interviews. The only reason I got this current internship is because my professor recommended me. Networking is also extremely important. Connect with your professors or anyone in the field online, LinkedIn especially. Build your LinkedIn, make sure you have a good headline so you pop up for recruiters. Make sure I looks good. Add connections to people in similar fields. I have personally reached out to hiring managers on LinkedIn and have gotten interviews that way. I didn't do internships all through college until this year. I quit my job to do it because I knew it was important to have this experience before I graduated. I just can't believe how much attention I'm getting now. It really makes a difference! My internship ends in 2 weeks so I'm looking for another job and looks like I might have choices if I pass these interviews! Time to start grinding leetcode lol.\n\nEdit: I am 31 and a female so your never too old and I'm one of the minorities. I live in a rural area where there are no tech jobs. This is a remote internship. Don't take unpaid internships, ever. Build projects and put them on github I have 40 repos so far. I have lots of bills to pay since I'm older. So it was a huge risk for me to take this internship. I had money I saved so I could do this internship. I think it was worth the risk because I wasn't getting any interviews before and now I have a ton. Even though I'm out of a job in two weeks, I am confident I will land another job, I work very hard learning everyday. Practice every single day and you will get better. Also make sure your resume is formatted nicely and up to par.",

            "The problem is: how do I get people to connect with me on LinkedIn who I don\u2019t even know? \n\nI have around 30 connections on LinkedIn (most of them are people I know irl), but I\u2019m not really sure how to connect with popular programmers who I don\u2019t know. \n\nI see people on LinkedIn with 500+ connections and I have no idea how they do it.",
            "I\u2019m interning at a small-medium size financial company this summer as a developer, about halfway through my internship i got contacted by a recruiter at capitalOne to apply for their full time junior role through LinkedIn, my current internship being the highlighted talking point during the connection. Not only do more recruiters reach out but you could also land a full time position at your internship which is what i\u2019m hoping for in my case, love the company and the work.\n\nMoral of story: DO INTERNSHIPS and don\u2019t stop applying, it\u2019s easy to let yourself get down after some rejections, i easily applied to 50-100 internships and got 2 offers through my junior year, i applied to maybe 20-30 sophomore year and got no offers.",

Students just don\u2019t understand that profs, especially at R1 schools have way more connections than an average person on LinkedIn. Most of them can get their PhD and MS students jobs and internships at big companies with little effort. They will do the same for UG students that they like. During my UG, my prof got me an internship at Twitter because his friend from grad school worked there. The first internship is always tough, and you should use all the resources you can get to land one.",

            "Rising senior who is doing his first internship this summer, I am wondering if I should delay my graduation to get another Internship at a much more prestigious company. Should I delay my graduation for another internship or should I just tough it out and apply for new grad roles with internship experience at a startup? If I do go with the latter, then I will do a lot of side projects to make up for the deficit of having only one internship."

        "selftext": "Hi everyone. I just wanted to post a note about this because I see quite a few people posting about negative interviewing experiences they had, where the interviewer was a complete dick to them. And I don't think people realize that that's something they should be reporting back to the recruiter, if they feel comfortable. \n\nWhen I was a senior a few years ago, I had a *horrible* interviewing experience. The guy showed up 15 minutes late and did not extend the interview by 15 minutes (and it was only a 30 minute interview!). When he gave me my coding question, he told me to pick any language I wanted, didn't like the one I picked, and then berated me for a few minutes about how I'd picked a stupid language and I should know better. Then whenever I tried to ask questions about the coding problem, he'd roll his eyes and tell me I should be able to figure that out. \n\nIn short...it was horrible. I complained about the experience to my brother, who's a tech lead at a FAANG, and he immediately suggest I tell my recruiter what happened. I was hesitant, but he assured me that recruiters *want* to know things like this. Their job is to match qualified candidates to open positions. If an interviewer is turning people off the job by being an asshole, then recruitment *needs* to know so they can fix that problem. And unless you write some scathing email absolutely blasting the company and the interviewer, the recruiter won't react negatively and you certainly won't be blacklisted. \n\nSo I reached out to the recruiter. I made sure to avoid attacking or blaming anyone, didn't get emotional, and made sure to just describe the impact that the interviewer had. This was the email I sent:\n\n>Hi \\[recruiter name\\],  \n>  \n>I just wanted to touch base about my interview with \\[interviewer's name\\] on \\[interview date\\]. I was a bit uncomfortable throughout the interview. \\[Interviewer's name\\] was 15 minutes late and did not extend our interviewing time, so I feel I was rushed and not given enough time to demonstrate what a good candidate I am. In addition, \\[interviewer's name\\] seemed very frustrated with the language I chose to do the technical portion of the interview in, and spent some time lecturing me about how I should have picked a different one. He seemed very annoyed with me throughout the entire interview, and it threw me off my game, and I don't feel I was really given a good environment to demonstrate my skills in.   \n>  \n>I don't know what the interviewing procedure is typically like at \\[company\\], but I was just a little disappointed because I really like \\[company\\] and felt it could have been a really good fit under different circumstances.   \n>  \n>Thank you,   \n>  \n>\\[my name\\]\n\nThe recruiter actually reached out to apologize and said they'd be speaking with that interviewer, and I was offered a second chance at the interview. At that point, I'd already accepted a different offer and declined to move forward. But I really appreciated knowing that there *is* recourse if you get an unfairly poor interviewer.",

My only concern is that a lot of interviews are not recorded (for example, i had a bad fb interview and they were not recorded but i didnt complain about it, still got the offer tho cuz they gave me a follow up interview due to contradicting rating and comments from 2 interviewers). So it is going to be your words against theirs. And why should a company trust you more than their current employee? I am always super hesitant when things like this happen cuz i feel like things can go either way.",

            "A couple of things to consider\n\n1. You might ruffle some feathers this way. The odds that you will get a second chance to interview are quite low. A good analogy is - When you interview with a company, companies won't give you feedback because the upside for them is almost 0. \n2. Always consider your goal. Ask yourself the simple question - Does sending an email to my recruiter help me achieve my goal of achieving an internship/FT offer?\n\nThis is simply speculation, and I could be wrong, so correct me if I am, but I think your brother is brainwashed by the snowflake culture they have these silicon valley tech companies. On top of that, you mention \"then recruitment needs to know so they can fix that problem\", but my question is - \"How exactly does this benefit you?\"",

Yes the real world sucks, but the trick to not hating your life is to find a good employer and stick with them. There are many ways to have a healthy work-life balance that won't make you hate coding. \n\nI have gone through periods of hating coding and loving it. Actually, most of the time I hated it was in college, because the courses were so overwhelming and stressful.

Our team is super small (5 people!), so our projects are small, and you can technically see a project through from beginning to end. Even when I worked for a huge company, we still worked in small teams. I solve problems all day, every day, and I only get burned out if I push *myself* too hard. I've yet to get in trouble for pushing back deadlines if they are unrealistic and require me to work more than 40 hours a week. I do feel incredibly lucky to love what I do and get paid for it.\n\nYou will be able to find the place that allows you to do what you love the most, and get paid for your passion.

            "\"I just wanna code for fun\".\n\nThe reality that flies in the face of this is not some recent phenomenon tied to layoffs or people struggling to find jobs. Its not even specific to software development.\n\nIts just how the world works. \n\nPlaying music in the garage with your homies is not the same thing as having a contract with a record company where you are expected to deliver results (an album, etc).\n\nCoding that fun little app in your free time is not the same thing as being paid to deliver value to a business that, for the sake of survival, has to focus on its bottom line.\n\nNothing on the professional level (even if you own your own business) is the same as it is on the hobby level. Clients are everything, if you can't deliver someone else will. This is the also the case between the employee-employer dynamic (in this case, your employer is basically your client).\n\nYour post seems more geared towards the \"getting the job\" part. Let me tell you, once you do its not going to change. It is, in every way, a job. You will work with tech stacks, projects, teams, managers, that you do not enjoy at all. \n\nI understand your sentiment with this post, but I just feel like maybe you haven't considered the reality of becoming a professional in a professional setting, and all the things that come with it.",

            "My first job was a 'two years experience required' job. Ever since then I figured that any listing of experience on the job listing should be thought of as +/- 3 years. \n\nPretty wild that they actually made a decision based on that tbh",

            "That is some bullshit imo. Programming internship is worth a hell of a lot more than someone who spent the last 6 years doing fuck all or working in history or art.",
            "As someone who\u2019s been working in CS for 10+ years, it always astounds (and angers) me how many entry level positions I have seen asking for years of experience. I have seen easily tens of job postings for an \u201centry level\u201d position *requiring* (not recommending) 3-5 years experience. And this sort of crap seems to be getting more and more prevalent as the years go by. It\u2019s ridiculous.",

            "I don't think it's that internships don't \"count\" as years of experience.  But if I'm comparing an employee with a degree and 1ye as a junior with another that is the same but 1ye as an intern, the former is more attractive all other things being equal.  Most companies don't stick hard and fast with ye items listed in job postings.  They take the best candidate who applies to the posting",
            "That's bullshit and just another excuse to exploit other",
            "Interesting, the recruiters I have spoken to so far in my job search have counted it. Although I have 1.5 years of full time permanent experience in addition, so that might make a difference to them",
            "There is a great influx of people wanting to enter the software industry. In the past it would have counted now there are many people like you(sadly). Did you last the lice coding though or never reached that point ?\n\nAlso multiple internships and not a real job offer is kinda red flag to them as why Noone wanted to extent?",
            "I personally don\u2019t get it, I was working 40 hrs/week for 8 months at a company, clearing tickets like everyone else, attended quarter reviews like everyone else, was performing like everyone else. Why can\u2019t this experience be counter in my YoE?",
            "I mean\u2026 sure it counts as years of experience. But you need 5 10-week internships to count as 1 year. Are you trying to count  one summer as a year?",

            "Yeah they don't but if you get a cool one it definitely helps. Interned at a company and the company I work for now, one of the cofounders was an early employee where I interned. Definitely helped me feel welcome on the team",

I slammed my internships on my resume for my job and they asked about it when I interviewed. \n\n\ud83e\udd14 IG It also could have help I had a working website with projects and an active GitHub at the time.\n\nIMO projects and repos are king anyways. A much better indicator of skill and interests.",
            "I did two summer internships and then joined full time the same company. They got me a security clearance on my first internship, so i remained in the system as an \u201cemployee\u201d (they actually paid me one hour a week to keep it kosher in the books i suppose). I still came in as an \u201cassociate\u201d (entry level), but it ended up speeding the process for me to get a second promotion, the manager was using my internship as years of experience to try to help me get the promotion to keep me at the company.\n\nSo it\u2019s a grey area that you can benefit from when you have some leverage.",
            "HR is dumb, I've seen internships that were more rigorous and rewarding than some degenerate employees slacking off and coasting on a full time 9-5 swe job",
            "The internships are not useless, you probably wouldn\u2019t have even got the interview without them. Unfortunately a candidate with some existing non intern experience applied and was good enough for the job. It\u2019s not the company being shitty, they just had one position to fill, and unfortunately someone else had more experience. Keep at it and you will find someone who prefers you over someone else.",
            "seriously, but who counts internships as YOE? sure I can just rack up 4 internships in each summer prior to graduation and have \"2 YOE\" by just working on small side projects or fixing documents.",

            "You're supposed to be going through campus recruiting for your first job out of college.\nThe problem with you, and the rest of people applying for thousands of jobs, is that you're competing with the recently laid off software engineering workforce. You have software engineers with years of experience applying for roles below their experience level. You might have lost the job to someone who was already working full time for one or two years, but that recently lost their job.\n\nIn a normal job market, that engineer wouldn't do a lateral move to another entry level role.",
            "It all depends on the kind of experience you actually acquired from your internship. So for example, during your 2 years of internship if you learned skills X, Y, and Z then they will most likely count it. Its all up to the interviewer and whether they see that experience valuable enough for the role or not.",
            "Yep, internships are mostly a waste of time. To ask for experience for an entry level position makes it not entry level though, so that job posting is nonsense. Or the job market is so bad that they are getting people with experience downgrading to entry level positions."

            "I had an interview with a top tech firm a few days ago and just before the interview the power suddenly cut off due to a power line malfunction. Literally 3-4 minutes before the interview. The interviewer called me by phone since that's how it works for that company and asked if the scheduled time was still a good time, to which I said I could take the interview but my connection would be slow because I was using my mobile hotspot. He let me reschedule without a problem since the conditions weren't right. The interviewers want to find good candidates, it's not in their interest to lose a potentially good candidate due to uncontrollable circumstances. Obviously this depends on the company too, and it's your call to make, but in general it shouldn't be a problem. On the other hand, you are international, and do need internships so this could be a missed chance if the company happens to fill their roles out. See what their policy says and make a decision, but don't worry too much about it. There are much more pressing issues that rightfully deserve your attention right now. Slava Ukraini!",
