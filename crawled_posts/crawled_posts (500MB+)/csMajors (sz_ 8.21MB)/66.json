I can\u2019t imagine the suffering he was in to drive him to go through with what he did. \n\nThese mental health struggles are so real. I\u2019ve been suffering from panic attacks, insomnia, and intense anxiety since the beginning of August. I have a job offer and possibly another on the way. These job offers mean nothing. The money means nothing. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m at risk of anything, but I\u2019m just emphasizing the importance of mental health. So many of us struggle in silence when we\u2019re not alone.",

            "Mental health challenges are serious, and our industry (especially in certain cutthroat companies) largely ignores them.\n\nIf you\u2019re still in school, take advantage of the mental health services that are available to you as a student. They might be better than what you\u2019ll find is available through your company benefits once you start working. Share your struggles and fears, and learn healthy ways of coping with the inevitable stress of starting a new job \u2014 before you are already in that situation.\n\nOnce you start a new job, find a mentor! The most important part of that relationship is feeling comfortable sharing all the things that are hard, scary, uncomfortable, etc. about your job. With that kind of vulnerability you will be able to get valuable feedback: Pointers on how to deal with difficult situations and people in the company, advice on which skills you need to consciously work on improving, and reality-checks to let you know when you\u2019re wasting energy worrying about trivial matters.\n\nYour fellow engineers are generally good people, who want to help you succeed. Ask questions, learn from your mistakes, and be grateful for the help you receive (even when your code is getting torn apart in a code review).\n\nWe\u2019re all in this together. Look for the people who realize that this is just a job, and there\u2019s a lot more to life than work. They get it.",

As a former suicidal person and someone who deals with depression, I have so much compassion for people that have actually gone through with it and of course people that are still fighting and suffering with it. You think you\u2019re being completely rational and logical in your thinking but the depression just hijacks your very ability to think. Condolences to his family.",
            "It\u2019s beyond shocking news. I\u2019ve known Yohanes and his brother since my sophomore year and I\u2019m a senior now. He\u2019s such a kind person and made me feel present in the room when I talked to him. Performing at the top of his class seemed effortless to him. I\u2019ve talked to him on multiple occasions throughout the years during school events but I never had the chance to get his number and he had 0 socials other than LinkedIn. I would have never thought he\u2019d go out this way. I\u2019m just left in confusion and I cherish all the few moments we had together, wishing I could see him again. Check up on your friends guys, you never know what they may be going through. My deepest condolences to his friends and family.",

            "I personally knew Yohanes pretty well. There are A LOT of different theories going out there where many people believe it's a cover up for a murder. Personally, I'm having a hard time believing the cause of death was suicide. Yohanes faced every challenge he had head on. He even challenged himself his final semester of his senior year to take some of the harder CS courses rather than taking it easy. I don't know what was going with Yohanes if there was something going on with him, and it's apparent that many of his family members are in the same boat. I don't know if something happened at Netflix, but ik Yohanes isn't one to step away from a challenge so easily. I can sit here and go thru a whole rabbit hole for weeks, but the bottom line here unfortunately is he is no longer with us. And that crap rly hurts to say, but those are the facts right now. As far as his cause of death, I have to believe what the police and the coroner's office are saying. It's possible they could be wrong, but regardless, I lost one of my good friends.",

As you said, when you are not healthy money and success mean nothing, I miss some little things and comfort of having a really well paid job, but the time spent with loved ones is way more important.\nBottom line, don\u2019t sacrifice your health for a job, not worth it",

These people sometimes are people who go to top schools, get top grades, get so many internships and other things you can\u2019t imagine. Yet these people haven\u2019t been able to apply to tech companies. A few years ago tech companies would kill to hire grads but now in 2023 the job market is so brutal, it\u2019s only going to get worse as more and more people are studying cs and its not like the companies grow more space for employees. At this point I\u2019m honestly considering another major, like because these people are geniuses and they are struggling so bad to find a job, how the fuck am I suppose to compete with them?

            "Imma keep it real with you, it doesn't look good lol. At my college, CS has become the #1 major for the most recent class of 2027. It's blown up way too much",
            "This is my 5th and final year as a CS/Math double major at a no-name school. Been on this sub for 3+ years now.\n\nThe complaining and job search was always a problem. More so recently, but it's just a bigger version of an existing problem for new grads. Hopefully it gets better, but if not, it would've been the same fundament problem whether you graduated 5 years ago or 5 years from now. \n\nWhen I graduate this spring, I'm just focusing on three things:\n\n1. Send lots of job applications. Cast a wide net and eventually you'll catch something given enough time.\n\n2. Get through the filter. If a human can't see my resume, it won't get accepted. \n\n3. The rare chance an interview is landed, don't waste it. I'm good at communicating and know my shit so as long as I give my all, I've done all that is in my power. \n\nUntil then, I'm just trying to finish my classes, improve my resume projects, and seeing if I can get a spring internship in addition to my current no-name internship. Also just enjoying college before I finish it to work a job for the rest of my life.",
            "Bro, do yourself a favor and stop listening to what redditors have to say. There are also people on those forums that claim doing the freebootcamp.com certification alone landed them a 6 figure tech industry job, there are people on there that say they're struggling finding a job in CS after graduating with a BS, there are people who went into Analytics/data science who claim its a major with lots of opportunities and good money, and in the next post a CS major who says Analytics/data science is a horrible major and can't compare to CS even though they haven't graduated yet. \n\nThe truth is, its really about who you know and the connection you make in school. I'm a bus and Econ Anlytics major with a minor in CS, I go to school and try my hardest to make connections, join data analytics and business clubs, show up to meetings, and make an effort to meet people. I've landed a couple summer internships (granted nothing impressive like Google or Twitter) and met a lot of people in the banking and corporate world. \n\nIn the mean time I know CS majors who don't like being social, who don't like putting themselves out there, who don't apply for anything that isn't a FAANG internship. \n\nYou want my genuine, college junior advice? Go into CS, major in it, MEET PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE INDUSTRY, go to fun clubs like video game club or whatever, BUT also go into business related clubs for the purpose of meeting people. If your school has a computer science related club that is more oriented towards meeting engineers and programmers in the actual industry,  go to those. Put yourself out there, don't be like 90% of the CS majors who don't make connections and think the degree alone is going to land them a 6 figure job at a FAANG.\n\nBut then again I'm a redditor so listen to me, don't listen to me.",

            "CS Majors all expecting to become multi-millionaires within a month of graduating are f*cked yes definitely. But CS has so many routes outside of tech for you that you're unlikely to struggle for a job in a general sense. If you're the bottom 80% of tech grads you're a top 10% in many other industries on skills alone IF you're smart enough to market yourself.",

            "Hiring surged and companies expanded their investment in tech during the pandemic.

The grades have to be good but we also have something more, AND you have to be a social fit for our team.\n\nIf I don't have that something extra, you're immediately at a disadvantage. We need people who don't just do programming to get a job, but people who're passionste enough that they do it on their own time.\n\nThe grades have to be 'good enough', but not necessarily stellar. The other two will determine how attractive it is to hire you. Fail any of them, and you won't get hired.\n\nThat's our process. We know it works. We haven't gotten a dud in years following it. Other companies will have their own process.",
            "Yes. The market is oversaturated at this point. \n\nOn top of that I feel like businesses are not willing to gamble on junior devs working remote. For whatever reason, juniors struggle a lot more with wfh. \n\nPlus chatGPT is actually amazing at solving the low level stuff a junior would normally handle.\n\nNot looking good imo.",
            "I haven't even finished my degree yet and I'm employed making good money. Not FAANG level stuff but enough to pay bills, have a little fun, and put plenty towards retirement. I don't attend a top school and I don't have top grades. Things are different yes, but our (American) entire economy is different than what it was just a year and a half ago. These companies tried to scoop people up as fast as they could because their companies were scaling during covid and they were getting dirt cheap cash from investors. Things are correcting. \n\nAnother thing, if I say anything here it's only a comment. I don't post about the job market because I don't care. I'm busy working hard to make stuff happen. If you want to switch majors because you thought development was an easy six figures but are scared because now you have to put in some work, then go ahead and switch majors. But if this is a field you believe in and want to pursue it, then stay the path. There will always be someone smarter than you. It's like worrying about how rich someone else is or how buff they are. On all 3 accounts, comparison is the thief of joy. And you should focus on your yesterday self more than the other person. If your yesterday self looks identical to you today without a single tiny shift. That's when you should be scared.",

I'm presuming it would take like 8 years for the next generation to realize the effects of all this wave of CS grads.

Y\u2019all are really doing too much. \nIf you have unrealistic expectations you will be let down when still unemployed after applying only to the Googles of the world and being rejected. \nSome of you also don\u2019t know that the ATS has a lot to do with whether your resume even makes it to the hiring manager. Your resume could be the underlying problem. \nAlso, it seems like all of this is coming only from those looking to be programmers.  Y\u2019all gotta chill out.  Every company relies programmers somehow and the more technically advanced we get, the more we need these programmers.  Where do you think these jobs are going?\nFor those saying that the market is becoming over saturated, look at CS majors like doctors.  A doctor has a specialty and so do those in CS.  Everyone graduating is not becoming a programmer so rest easy.  \nNobody knows what the future looks like but damn, y\u2019all are painting doom and gloom with every other post.  I know you are thinkers so come up with solutions to your problems.",
            "Its the same with engineering, which is what my major is. I think competition has just gone up for stem majors. It is clearly an **employer's market.** You could switch majors if you hate CS but any stem major will probably have a lot of competition, and non stem majors of course usually don't pay as much.  \n\n\nMy prediction for the future is that entrepreneurship could rise. If there is a higher supply of workers and low demand by tech companies, Then new companies have a large pool to pull from.",

But for a new grad it\u2019s not so important. \n\nIt may be harder to hit those stratospheric 6 figure salaries from here on in. But you never know.",

            "I don\u2019t really see people\u2019s logic that the industry \u201chas to recover\u201d in the next few years. There is massive and growing supply of new grads, the pace of people trying to get into the industry is far outpacing the number of roles available, even for mid level/senior positions. \n\nMy SAAS company is over 2k people and hasn\u2019t hired any engineers for the last few months and there hasn\u2019t been much difference even though our user base is growing. I feel like this could be in part to a lot of the developments and improvements with different languages, tools, and cloud infra. When we were hiring we received many resumes and a SIGNIFICANT amount of the engineers were very qualified. \n\nNot to say that we won\u2019t need IT/SWE\u2019s in the future, but it\u2019s a field that is constantly advancing so people can do more with less. I love my job and genuinely hope I\u2019m wrong, but being in the industry for a few years and talking to older engineers/managers who went through 2008, I really think this is more of a shift in the industry instead of just another recession. We just have way too many people entering the field in comparison to jobs available, a lot more then 2000/2008. Even if rates drop and the economy goes full force, there\u2019s still way too much supply.",
            "I'll be straight with you.\n\nIf it were me, and I was back in school and early enough to switch, I probably would. That's not just because of the job market though. A big part of it is I basically ignored my mental health in school. And it culminated to this event after graduating, where I had a severe mental episode and basically lost myself. Between that and the heavy medication I am on, matched with the disillusionment as I entered the market, it really tested me to see if I was really *into* tech. And tbh, I'm not really that into it anymore. Its weird because in school I was all about it, really enjoyed programming and making things, loved my classes, etc. But now, idk it just feels like I'm someone else. My interest has changed, my mind doesn't work the same as it used to, i'm not sharp enough for it now tbh.\n\nEnough about me though, let's think together here. If you were going to switch majors, what would you choose? Get a game plan together. Look at jobs for that major and see what 'competitive' looks like in the market for a new grad. Is it reasonable? Are you willing to do that? Talk to other people from that major, see how it really is. Ask them about their job search, how's it going? Just do your research before making the switch.\n\nAlso do some introspection, why are you majoring in comp sci? what do you want to do? where do you see yourself in the workplace? what does your ideal responsibilities look like?  does the major make sense with what you want to do? etc.\n\nLastly, just a little side note here, mental health is extremely important! Take care of yourself OP!",
            "This sub is really something else sometimes\n\nAs a new grad who\u2019s been working as an SWE, you will be fine. The median new grad salary for cs is still vastly higher than the median new graduate salary. The demand for software engineers is only increasing. Most applicants for new roles aren\u2019t qualified and make filtering very difficult. Once you get your first entry level job you\u2019re chilling.\n\nAlso don\u2019t forget that our material conditions are getting worse because of the wealth gap and the approach of late stage capitalism. These economic struggles are not a tech sector issue, but a system issue.",
            "It's totally fucked",
            "No, future cs grads are not fucked. There are plenty of jobs out there, you just have to lower your standards/expectations and make the most of your career fair. Lots of local or relatively unknown companies that pay 6 figures exist, you just have to go out and find them. If you want a big tech experience, you are going to need big tech work ethic.",
            "If you truly have a passion for CS then go for it, nothing will stop you if you work hard. Otherwise if you just pick a major looking at job prospects, the market is brutal now. There are Dec 2022 graduates waiting, then May 2023 grads, Summer grads and now Dec grads lol. On top of that the layoff and experienced folks too.\n\nIf you wanna change major, I would say maybe Supply Chain. Every Supply Chain majors that I knew got a decent $70-80k job right after college before graduation. It's upto you though.",

            "In short, yes. I luckily found and have a job post-grad, but know people who are still looking.

It's going to suck for the next couple years for new grads, but it'll even out for STEM majors like it always does. \n\nDon't be discouraged if you aren't in a job right out of undergrad. New grad positions and internships are open for a couple years after graduation for a reason.\n\nKeep applying, get your resume reviewed, do a leetcode question a day, work on some side-project, etc. A couple hours a week on tutorials in a relevant technology you're interested in is all you need for side-projects!

Even if you can afford a zero on this assignment as you\u2019ve been saying in your comments, you should still go to the Professor and let him know what happened.

            "I\u2019d try and email the professor and offer to show evidence that you wrote the code yourself, it\u2019s just that your classmate copied it while you were trying to help them. It\u2019s not fair you get a 0 for just trying to help someone, and if you clearly only had the intent to help you can\u2019t get in trouble for that.",

If that other student has any sense of remorse, they would go to the professor themselves and admit their faults. That's the right thing to do, any normal person would feel bad and want to make things right to the person that helped them.\n\nOne time I turned around in class during a quiz and asked another student if she saw where my bottle of contact solution went. It was on the floor somewhere cause it rolled away from me. The teacher in high school gave us both a zero. I went to him after class and told him what happened and to only give me a 0. He decided to not take away both of our points.\n\nIf the other students code looks nothing like yours, then go into the professors office hours and go over what he compared the parts of the plagerism. You can use websites like [this](https://www.w3docs.com/tools/code-diff/) to compare sources of code. Also did you post your code anywhere online? That would be another reason.\n\nAlso how much of the assignment did the other student copy? This looks like it could be one section. You can even argue that you did share one section of your code and try to help this other student. You dont have to take the blame for your entire assignment being shared. One section of shared code can make a difference. You can say after going back and forth with the other student, you felt that it would be hard for them to understand without seeing the code directly. You just did not expect them to turn it in verbatim.\n\nYou need to talk to the other student though. You mentioned you are a sophmore. That student may or may not continue a programming major in the future. You may also be sharing the same student and professor for future classses. I recommend speaking the classmate first, have him share his code with you. Then find your problem area.\n\nThe first step is to rule out the other student of wrongdoing. If that student is your friend they will help you find the exact source and reason for your 0.",

Even to \"use mine to figure out where he went wrong\", its still cheating, and you are still helping other students cheat. If a classmate asks for extensive help, you point them to the professor. Most programming assignments are individual, you shouldn't be giving that much help to other students. \n\n>what are my options? I realize I made a mistake, but I had good intentions.\n\nYou hope that the university doesn't pursue this further and just leave it as a 0.

In my time as a CS student I've treaded lightly with helping others, let alone sharing code. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLike you said, you shared the code but you didnt intend on that student just straight copying it. This is a huge liability you open up when you do this. You basically 'assume' they wont directly copy your code... but obviously there is no guarantee by any means.  In the future, its best to walk through with other students the thought process and logic, but the buck really needs to stop there! Don't ever share your direct code itself, its far too risky!",

Since you already committed academic dishonesty, you probably can't salvage the assignment.\n\nAnd definitely don't even risk doing this again.  Depending on policy and previous offenses, people can instantly fail entire courses for a single incident, or even get kicked out of school (especially for multiple incidents).  A bad grade on a single assignment, is letting you off easy.\n\nAnd the policy usually considers letting someone plagiarize, to be as bad as plagiarizing yourself.",

If he has already told you that he has noticed your hard work, then he probably knows that someone used your work, as opposed to you both copying it. But, he couldn't give that person a zero without giving you one. If I were in your shoes, I would not bring this up with the professor unless you saw any indication that he was going to hold this against your final grade.\n\nIf you do speak with the professor. I would be very careful with what I would say to the him. Say only enough to show that you came up with the code and that you shared some of the code with a classmate to help them out.
