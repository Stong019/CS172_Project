They think this makes it more secure, but it causes people to use weaker passwords so they can easily get back in. They have no options to adjust these settings and you can't even complain to their support because you have to be a member of the HR department to even contact Workday. Oh yeah, and the app doesn't appear to let you copy and paste when you are updating your password, so if you have a more secure password you better hope you can type it in correctly.\n\nThis is one of those companies that think they are doing a great job, because of all the companies that are using them, but they fail to realize that the companies spent a lot of time and effort getting it setup and training employees how to use it, so they are basically just stuck with workday. After seeing all the shortcomings changing to something else would just be an even bigger headache.\n\nI'm sure if Workday allowed the employees of companies, you know the people that actually use the application on a regular basis, to submit issues directly to Workday they would quickly see why it's so frustrating to use.\n\n(If anyone knows where to lodge complaints to Workday, let me know, because I've been through the app and the website and still can't find a place to log a complaint or get help.)",

Also, the message to check the '\"Security Alert\" was activated every time I access the portal. This could be our admin laziness but it is annoying as hell!  They should have three options (best practice) to recommend, saying once a day (or  Monday to Friday is) fine too. Not every time you log in and out.

Took a month to fix a issue and get paid and even then it was done incorrectly. Instead of the 20% tax deduction only taking half that. This app sucks. Can't clock in early if told to do so. Have a small window of time to fix issues to be paid on time. Every pay day is wrong and or late. Since I downloaded the app my phone isn't working properly. Takes up a huge amount data. $40 month on my phone bill.  This app is going to cause law suits there are federal labor laws that are supposed to guard against this incompetency.

            "My analytical and interactions skills have always exceeded my technical skills.\n\nOne of the best answers I gave on a technical test, \u201cI would rip the code out of another program\u201d.\n\nThe interviewer said on review, \u201cThat is a correct answer.\u201d\n\nI got the job.",
            "Na I'm good",
            "Couldn't agree more. I'm not the greatest LC guy, nor do I have as much technical experience as others have, but I'm able to hold conversations really well and managed to land my internship by talking to a lot of devs and having great conversations w my interviewers.\n\nSide note, I also hate when people ask questions in the groupchat and no one even tries to respond. I didn't realize that CS and math people are so antisocial until I got into the higher level classes.",
            "Someone give me tips on how to make friends in my major. I don\u2019t think people in my major like me because whenever I talk they don\u2019t take me seriously. It may be because I\u2019m a girl but the other girls in my major are taken seriously.",
            "honestly, workplace communication skills and social smalltalk skills are not as similar as I expected. \n\nImmigrants are a great example of this, most of them don't really fully \"socially fit in\" with smalltalk and whatnot but many of them do great in tech.",
            "When I was in school I hung out all the time with a group of fellow CS majors. Bonding over programming projects can spill over socially.\n\nOn the other hand my brother was a total introvert and never did a thing. That\u2019s on him, not the CS degree.",
            "This is exactly why I'll use some of my Microsoft Summer internship money to fly to South Korea for a month. I have a best friend I want to meet there of 2 years of knowing each other. I'm starting to value my life more because life is too short to keep yourself isolated and work none stop.\n\nTrust me, I ain't close to retirement, but I am sure once I'm old, I'll regret not being social and enjoy life to it's fullness.",
            "I really wish I did. But it's so freaking hard. I regret my social skills being so bad but no matter how hard I try, it is harder.",
            "Very true I can say I got an internship because I had an interesting conversation with my interviewer rather than being hired purely on my prior experience/ resume.",
            "> One of the biggest ways to get ahead of people in interviews is to be good socially \n\nI disagree with this. Most people I know who have trouble getting top tier internships are fine socially, but can't do leetcode. Doing leetcode will help you more.",
