        "selftext": "Back when I was in undergrad, I used to read posts on here and CSCQ, and I would literally cry because it felt like I was never going to measure up and be successful. I have an older brother that makes $500k as a tech lead at a FAANG company, and that just made it worse. I felt like I would never be good enough. \n\nI wanted to tell my story to give some hope to the average students.\n\nThe only internship I had in college was with some tiny little no-name company, and it only paid me $11/hour. Some of my friends were making $30/hour and I was embarrassed. But I put my head down, worked hard, and learned as much as I could. The job search had been brutal, and even though some of my friends were choosing between Amazon and Apple, I considered myself lucky to have gotten anything at all. \n\nWhen I graduated in December 2019, I had a $70k job lined up in a LCOL city. Not a well-known company and the pay wasn\u2019t particularly good, but again I was grateful to have anything at all. I wasn\u2019t good at leetcode, but my strategy was just to take interview after interview until I finally passed one. And in the process, I did get better at leetcode. Not a lot better. Leetcode sucks.\n\nUnfortunately, the covid shit hit the fan within a few months, and I lost the job in April 2020. No one was hiring at the time and I was in a complete panic, so I tried one of the only industries that wasn\u2019t affected by the pandemic: defense. I signed a new offer within 2 weeks of getting laid off. Everyone always told me defense was a shitty, low-paying industry to get into. But I didn\u2019t care, and I had a great experience working there. I made $73k in a LCOL area, management was very supportive, and I gained a lot of confidence working there. \n\nAfter a year of working in defense, I got a bug in my brain that I could be making more money, so I put a few resumes out and ended up signing an offer for $100k cash plus stock incentive (about $120k total including my 401k match). I never EVER would\u2019ve thought I\u2019d be making this much money. I wish I could go back in time and give my 2017/2018 self a hug. \n\nI get that $120k with 2 years of experience isn\u2019t a ton of money to some people, but it\u2019s more money than I literally ever expected to make. I\u2019m over the moon. I may not work for a FAANG, but I have a great job and a great life.\n\nI still do struggle with imposter syndrome and I think it\u2019s at least partially because of subreddits like this one. My manager just told me last week that I should expect a positive year end review, and I was so relieved that I almost cried. I think part of me is still waiting for someone to figure out that I\u2019m just some average Joe who made $11/hour at their college internship, and I don\u2019t really deserve this job after all. \n\nAnyway, sorry if this was rambling. I just wanted to tell you all that FAANG isn\u2019t the answer for everyone, that your college internships don\u2019t seal your fate forever, and there\u2019s a ton of living that comes after college. Don\u2019t put too much pressure on yourself.",

        "selftext": "This sub is obsessed with 200k TC, but seems to forget that 200k in the Bay Area is equivalent to less than 160k ish in Seattle when adjusted for CoL and taxes. So, I did some calculations to show y'all how much you have to make in other regions to have a similar quality of life (Disposable Income) as making 200k in the bay area.\n\nThe calculations assume 4 things:\n\n1. stocks are converted to cash immediately upon vesting and taxed like regular income\n2. Recurring TC only, no bonus\n3. renting a 1 bedroom apartment without a roommate at the median rate\n4. everyone spends 1.5k/month in food+groceries+utilities (frapuccinos ain't cheap y'all)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|*Location*|Equivalent TC|Federal Income Tax|State Income Tax|Other local Tax|FICA+State Insurance Tax|Rent|other necessary spending|disposable income|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Bay Area|**200k**|$43,563|$16,694|$2,931|$12,903|$33,600|$18,000|**$72,309**|\n|Seattle|**160k**|$31,473|0|0|$11,174|$21,120|$18,000|**$78,233**|\n|Austin|**155k**|$30,273|0|0|$11,101|$17,760|$18,000|**$77,866**|\n|Dallas|**155k**|$30,273|0|0|$11,101|$17,280|$18,000|**$78,346**|\n|Atlanta|**170k**|$33.963|$9,183|0|$11,319|$20,160|$18,000|**$77,375**|\n|NYC|**215k**|$48,412|$13,686|$8,568|$12,223|$38,160|$18,000|**$75,951**|\n|Boston|**180k**|$37,170|$8,676|0|$11,466|$29,640|$18,000|**$75,048**|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo yeah, deciding between a 200k Bay Area offer and a 150k Austin offer is not as straightforward as you might think.\n\nAtlanta is possibly the worst possible city to be in because its rent is relatively high and no companies pay anywhere near 170k. Seattle seems to be the best bang for buck relative to the jobs available. If you just look at CoL and low taxes, texan cities are unbeatable, but you might be hard pressed to find a 155k TC job in Texas.\n\nAlso, assumption 4 is probably very inaccurate as food/grocery/utility prices scale with CoL. Sales tax is also high in Bay Area. So, TC for Bay Area probably needs to be higher to be equivalent to the other TCs.\n\nNYC is unsurprisingly crazy expensive.\n\nInstead of TC or GTFO, I propose DI (disposable income) or GTFO as the new standard.\n\nsources\n\n1. rent: [https://www.zumper.com/blog/rental-price-data/](https://www.zumper.com/blog/rental-price-data/)\n2.

That was my \"huge\" year-long project for my capstone course.\n\nI can assure you, 100 lines of Python in 3 imports will run just fine in VS Code on a 3-year old MacBook with 8 GB RAM.\n\nHell, you could use a cheap smart phone for most college programming classes and it'll be just fine.",
            "I think maybe the confusion here is that incoming students may believe they'll be learning or doing really complicated and lengthy programming in college courses. They don't usually understand that college programming classes just barely scratch the surface and are just designed around teaching you very simple and abstract concepts, not to design or code complex applications or solve serious problems.\n\nTo use construction metaphors, college programming teaches you about wood, metals, and plastics, some basic geometry, all about screws, nails, bolts, washers, nuts, brackets, and how to use a handful of basic tools like screwdrivers, hammers, saws, measuring tape, levels, wrenches, sockets, and then how to build things from scratch like birdhouses, mailboxes, kids' toys, wood pallets, and maybe a jewelry box.\n\nIn more advanced courses you will learn how to frame a window, replace a door, make a table, repair an overhang, and cap it off with building a dog house or maybe a team project to construct a small toolshed. You will begin *learning* about how garages and houses are built and may take speciality courses in foundations, storm damage, regulations and codes, fire prevention, stuff like that.\n\nWhat you will **not** be doing is building a house, designing a sky scraper, or working on a new stadium project.\n\nI think a lot of incoming students are under the impression they will be learning how to or even build huge or complicated pieces of software or video games that will need elaborate dev environments to design, prototype, code, and test. Just judging by some of these posts, it seems that students are over-estimating how much they will learn, how big the projects will be, and what will be asked of them.\n\nTo be clear, incoming students need to understand you don't learn how to build very sophisticated or feature-packed software or video games in CS degree programs. College courses just *barely* scratch the surface of what is required to design and create software. It is far more complicated and time-consuming than you could fit into 15-20 3-hr/week classes.",

        "selftext": "Hey fellow CS majors,\n\nI've been wanting to share my story for a while now, hoping that it might resonate with some of you who are struggling or on the fence about majoring in computer science. Let me tell you, my journey through this major has been an emotional roller coaster that has left me with nothing but regret.\n\nFirst off, let me clarify that I was truly passionate about technology and coding when I started. I had this grand vision of becoming a software engineer, working on cutting-edge projects, and changing the world. The promise of high-paying jobs and endless opportunities drew me in like a moth to a flame. But little did I know that reality would hit me like a ton of bricks.\n\nThe workload, oh my god, the workload. I thought I was prepared for it, but nothing could have prepared me for the endless nights of debugging, the constant stress of meeting deadlines, and the feeling of inadequacy that seemed to hang over me like a dark cloud. It seemed like every week brought a new programming language to learn, a new framework to master, and a new project that felt impossible to complete.\n\nAnd the competition \u2013 don't even get me started on that. It felt like I was constantly surrounded by geniuses who had been coding since they were in diapers. Every time I entered a coding competition or attended a hackathon, I was reminded of how far behind I was. The imposter syndrome hit me harder than a freight train, and I began to doubt my own abilities.\n\nBut the worst part? The job market. You would think that with a CS degree, job offers would be pouring in, right? Wrong. The oversaturation of the market meant that even entry-level positions required years of experience. It was a catch-22 \u2013 I needed a job to gain experience, but I needed experience to get a job. The rejection emails piled up, each one a reminder of how little I had to show for my years of hard work and sacrifice.\n\nAnd let's talk about mental health. The constant pressure to perform, the isolation of spending hours in front of a screen, and the feeling that you're always one step away from failure \u2013 it took a toll on my mental well-being. Depression and anxiety became my unwanted companions, and seeking help felt like admitting defeat in a field that prides itself on being all-knowing and confident.\n\nSo, here I am now, feeling like I've been chewed up and spat out by the CS major machine. The promises of a bright future seem like a distant dream, and all I have to show for it is a piece of paper that feels more like a cruel joke. My passion has turned into resentment, my confidence shattered, and my hope for a better life crushed.\n\nI know this might come across as a sob story, but I genuinely want to caution those of you who are considering majoring in computer science. It's not all rainbows and unicorns \u2013 there are tears, sleepless nights, and moments of deep regret. I wish someone had told me the harsh truth before I embarked on this journey.\n\nIf you're thriving in your CS major, I genuinely applaud you. But if you're struggling like I did, just know that you're not alone. It's okay to question your path, to seek help when you need it, and to explore other options if this isn't the right fit for you. Don't let the allure of success blind you to the very real challenges that come with majoring in computer science.\n\nStay strong, my fellow CS majors. And remember, your worth isn't defined by a degree or a job title.",

This subreddit just needs a major wake up call that a no name company in an average city still pays well (for the COL of said area) and the work life balance is probably 10x better than these super competitive jobs.\n\nThe job market IS bad right now but to blame that on the degree or the work we do is just short sighted\n\nStop making a CS degree sound like a holy grail that only few touch. It\u2019s a challenging degree sure but this post just reads main character energy like the world stopped when you graduated",
            "Literally -1 year ago and you could have simply memorized a few patterns with a few hundred hours of practice, and likely gotten a faang offer around 200k.  Fail that and there were many other positions that would have given 150k.  Right out of school, totally solvable questions in the interview.\n\nThe *time* is what is screwing you.  Companies decided to fire hundreds of thousands of people, and they all have experience.  Of course they are going to hire those people back first.\n\nYou need to realize that cycles tend to go the *other* way, and this AI thing is a wildcard.  If it takes off, it's going to produce more CS jobs than anything prior - more than it takes away by a lot - and fire everyone else.  \n\nYour goal now is to find a credible job to put on your resume while you wait for the market to go the other way and you refine your interview skills.",

            "That is completely fair. And certainly, applaud you for getting through your degree in CS as that is something you should be proud of, and it certainly isn\u2019t an easy degree. But with those high paying jobs, to be completely honest with you, the competition just makes sense, and honestly is better than other high paying careers. Think about it. The main other jobs that people usually know about that have very high earning potential in the US are law and, of course, medicine. And let\u2019s examine things there with the latter \u2013 as I\u2019m personally much more familiar with that process.\n\nThe average medical school acceptance rate is 5%. That is, the AVERAGE medical school (not even talking about top med schools) in the nation accepts only 5% of applicants. Sure, the statistics might be slightly misleading due to some factors but in general let\u2019s just take this number as it is. This makes an average med school as \u201cstatistically\u201d challenging to get into as it is to get a FAANG job. This is a process that requires two rounds of essays per school (and unlike many SWE application essays these essays matter a lot), interviews per school, four years of research experience/volunteering, and a summer spent studying for the MCAT like it\u2019s a 9-7 job. And when you\u2019re applying to medical schools, you\u2019re competing against people who were willing to do the same things you did to apply to those med schools, not just basically anyone who has a LinkedIn account and knows how to upload a resume. And of course, when you do get in, it\u2019s 4 years med school, 4 years residency, and likely 3-5 more in a fellowship for specialty.\n\nI guarantee you that this process is harder than learning to code and doing 100 leetcode questions over a summer.\n\nSo what my point is, is that you should be proud of yourself and your passion for programming. But also consider in perspective what kind of starting salary range you\u2019re expecting and talking about here, and consider what other careers need to do to earn similarly even with many years of experience. Job hopping works, and honestly if you keep working towards it I\u2019m sure you\u2019re smart enough to get to a salary you consider \u201cgood\u201d. This is just a point I see people making a lot that kinda bothers me, because it makes them and others discouraged from pursuing something they\u2019re interested in (unless you\u2019re not actually into coding, in which case pls don\u2019t do it not worth it lmao)",

            "Happened upon this post and wanted to offer some counsel from a different perspective. Full disclosure, I'm not a CS major. I got a BBA and MAcc in Accounting. But I have a passion for computers and worked my way into IT. I got burnt out in the investment banking world. My expectations for myself were killing me. I was sabotaging myself. I quit and spent a summer learning Python. Also got on antidepressants and started counseling. Managed to get a job as an IT Business Analyst at a factory. I am far, far happier now. The job change was huge, but even more was the mental change. Getting my head right made life infinitely better. My job is comparatively more stressful now, but I can deal with it better. So two suggestions for you:\nFirst, get your head right. Sounds like you come from a high expectation background. Cut yourself some slack. See a therapist. Learn to see your value as a human being apart from your achievements. And find a side project that gives you joy. Something that pumps you up about computers. That enthusiasm is infectious and will get you far in interviews. \nSecond, if you get your head right, and you still feel like you're in the wrong place, don't be afraid to change careers! Sideways mobility is greater now than it ever has been before. If you have a degree and you can hold a conversation, there's a LOT of jobs out there waiting for you.\nBut first get your head in the right place :)",

You're absolutely right that coding isn't a magically better career than every other career. The benefits are undeniable compared to physical labor or even medicine/law. Hours are better, perks are great, and culture is much more relaxed in general than a hospital, a law firm, or even a Starbucks.\n\nBut it's still a job.\n\nIf you're trying to find a job to slog through (most people are), programming is well into the truly comfortable end of the spectrum. The financial stability and benefits (healthcare, flexible hours, etc) are hard to find anywhere else.\n\nIf you thought coding would be a passion instead of a job, that's a function of the job, and a function of whether you actually enjoy coding for coding's sake. That is much, much rarer despite the hype.\n\nStay strong! The good life is still coming, even if it feels bad.",

            ">seeking help felt like admitting defeat in a field that prides itself on being all-knowing and confident\n\nOnly inexperienced idiots on the left-side of the Dunning-Krueger curve act like that. They think they know everything because they barely know anything and are too ignorant to know how much they don't know.\n\nReal professionals who have been in the industry a long time are well-aware that there's an enormous amount of knowledge we have never seen before, never will see, and will have to learn if we ever do need to know it.\n\nHalf of my average day is spent trying to figure stuff out I don't know or learning about stuff I'm not even sure yet if I'll need to know, and I've been doing this professionally for 30 years, another 12 years as a hobbyist, and have won every programming contest I've ever been in. This stuff is hard. Sometimes it kicks my ass and stresses me out and keeps me awake all night trying to wrap my head around something new or something I forgot. Sometimes I miss hard deadlines because I got distracted, took on too many things, promised something I didn't have time to deliver, or didn't figure something out as quickly as I'd expected.\n\nDo I lack confidence? Not at all. But not because I'm the best developer in the world (I'm not) or even in the top 10% (I might not be), but because every challenge I've ever faced, I solved. Sometimes it took longer or cost more or required a totally different approach than I thought and I had to admit I was wrong. But I always figured it out.\n\nBut you know what? Everybody else goes through this too. We're all in the same boat. Every programmer in the world faces huge challenges that kick their ass sometimes and keeps them up at night. All of them.\n\nBut we're all in this together. All facing similar challenges and different challenges. And all of our work is hard. But this is what brings us together as a community and creates huge online communities full of all sorts of selfless, egotistical, brilliant, short-tempered, arrogant, insecure, confident, and friendly bunch of strangers that will bend over backwards and drop everything to lend you a hand.\n\nWhy? Because someone once did it for them. I've had lots of help along the way, lots of mentors. And I've helped and mentored others. And I love it all. Every bit of it. I could not see myself doing anything else.",

I found people that had very small budgets and made websites for cheap/free and then charged a small amount of hosting. I went onto my countries version of craigslist, found companies advertising their services that had no website, made a quick one and then messaged them saying that I saw their advert with no website and here's something they can have for free if they just pay me monthly hosting. I also got into a program on national radio where they gave a business 30 secs to advertise their business for free... same thing I will build your site free just 1 year hosting lock in. Luckily I managed to find a job a few months out of university but that was beside the point. I had already built up a resume of low cost, low hassle clients essentially paying me monthly for nothing, and any extra work these people wanted was basically guaranteed to come to me at an hourly fee. After that these people would constantly refer me more work.\n\nThe point here is that I made opportunities for myself. If you have the skills then find ways to apply it. I used shared hosting from hostgator to start which cost like $50 a month. Each client was paying me $10 a month for hosting/email so I just needed 5 clients to cover costs. After that it was all upside. For $10 a month there was no value in these clients leaving me so it was constantly income. Over and above this you now have apps etc that people may want. It doesnt have to be amazing either. My sites were essentially a carbon copy just using a CMS and then making each client a custom template.

It's brave of you to share your story, and I'm sure many, even outside of the CS domain, can relate to the sentiments you've expressed. The academic and professional world is often romanticized, and the realities can sometimes be harsh and unexpected.\n\nIt sounds like the combination of academic pressures, an ultra-competitive environment, and job market realities have been immensely tough on you. I've seen similar sentiments echoed by peers in various fields, where the end goal seems constantly out of reach, despite the effort and time invested.\n\nImposter syndrome is insidious and pervasive, especially in fields like CS where innovation and competition move at breakneck speeds. Remember that comparing your journey to others' highlight reels is a treacherous path. Everyone has their struggles, even if they're not immediately apparent.\n\nThe job market conundrum is a tough one. It's bizarre to think that an industry, which seems to be growing exponentially, can have such challenging entry points. But industries ebb and flow, and hopefully, the saturation you're witnessing is temporary.\n\nIt's heartbreaking to hear about the toll this has taken on your mental health. The academic and professional world often fails to account for the human element, prioritizing results and productivity over well-being. I'm glad you're speaking out about this, as it's a conversation that desperately needs more traction.\n\nI hope that sharing your story brings you some catharsis. And while the path you've traveled might feel littered with regrets right now, remember that every experience, both good and bad, shapes us in some way. It's okay to pivot, to reconsider, and to seek out new paths that align more with your well-being and passion.\n\nLastly, thank you for offering a perspective that many might be too afraid to voice. Discussions like these are vital to help foster understanding, compassion, and potential reform in the way industries and institutions operate.\n\nSending strength and positive vibes your way. Remember, every end is a new beginning."

Apply to Amazon - claim you're a junior regardless of your actual year and try and embellish it enough to get an OA\n\n3.

Not sure how competitive the applications are since a lot of it comes down to luck since I\u2019ve seen many students with great resumes get turned down with no interviews while other students with average resumes get offers.",
