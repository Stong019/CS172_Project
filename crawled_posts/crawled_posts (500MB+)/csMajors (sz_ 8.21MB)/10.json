Also, there was no bonus aside from the total compensation.\n\nSo, I asked for a base compensation that was 8% higher than what they offered me.

Without any experience, any offer is probably a good offer right now (if it is within reason).\n\nTech has been crushed with layoffs. Hiring has either frozen or slowed to a crawl at many places. There is no shortage of SWEs right now. In fact, there are too many. I was laid off from a startup recently and it took me 5 months to find employment. I have more than 12 years of professional dev experience and much of that as a lead SWE. I had to lower my expectations to find something (I took a senior level position).\n\nI wouldn\u2019t focus on money in the present. I would instead focus on gaining relevant experience and self-improvement. This will become increasingly important as AI improves and is more accessible. Entry level SWE jobs will be phased out, and it will be nearly impossible to get a job programming without many years of experience and/or great skill. I feel for anyone graduating right now.

Applied and interviewed with a company who made me do the following:\n\n- Initial Leetcode and JavaScript trivia questions round\n- Homework with framework of choice (React/Angular)\n- Group Panel with more programmer trivia, CSS trivia, backend trivia and hey, even math trivia/brainteasers - as if it was some kind of hazing ritual\n\nApparently after my first round of leetcode and JavaScript trivia, despite my resume showing I had 8 years+ experience as a Sr FullStack engineer working at many well to do companies; the hiring manager told my recruiter that I wasn\u2019t smart and he didn\u2019t think I should get paid what I was asking for.\n\nI thought to myself - what a fucking jerk, that manager sounds like he has a stick up his ass.  The recruiter told me not to take the manager seriously and that he would do a good job for me to get the best deal.  I was a bit desperate given the layoffs in the market so far and so I went thru with the other interview rounds and completed the homework even though I didn\u2019t get paid for it.\n\nI finally got a verbal offer after all that and it was pretty lowball.  The recruiter said that I should take the offer, so I asked him if the company could wait until the next day for me to make a decision.  He said okay, and said he\u2019d have paperwork for me to sign anyway in a day.\n\nThe next day, the recruiter texted me said that the company decided to rescind the offer.  I was taken aback\u2014 like wtf?  What a shitty toxic company\u2014 they didn\u2019t want to wait even one day for me, they decided on their own that my hesitation to sign was enough for them to rescind.  \n\nI felt gutted too because I was thinking of taking the job since I was starting to run out of money.  \n\nToday I can tell you I am so glad I didn\u2019t take that shitty company\u2019s offer.  I got another offer today and it was written for MORE than I made at any of my previous jobs.  I\u2019m so happy! \n\nSo I write to you that despite all the crap that goes on in tech\u2014you dodged a bullet, and so did I.  There are good companies out there and if you just work on your skills and interview to many places, you will get something good eventually.  Just keep working at your interviews and good things will happen, don\u2019t put too much weight in any company, especially the shit toxic ones.  Weed those out, and let them waste their money and time until they do everyone a favor and go out of business.\n\nGood luck!",

Better than to go all in on a busted hand.\n\nYou don't want this job. The candidate who got the job does not want this job, but will be somehow sucked in and stuck.\n\nYou did good! You caught them before you got sucked in. They almost had you.\n\nGo back and do it again. Make sure you are interviewing management as hard as they are interviewing you.

This is a red flag from a hiring standpoint, they met his ask, and then he asked for more. It's a no brainer to go with an alternative candidate.\n\nAlso negotiation is always a risk. I don't agree with how this company handled it and they should have just responded that they are firm on the offer, but it is still basically like he negotiated a salary, then tried to renegotiate it after settling on a number that was previously acceptable to him.
