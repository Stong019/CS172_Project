Getting good grades requires you to ace those tests and assignments. In retrospect, I knew what I had to focus on.\n\nAlso, to be fair, getting a \"perfect\" grade is overrated and adds pressure. I felt the pressure to not \"fail\" anything. Ideally, experiencing some failures is good as it helps you focus less on the \"grade\" and more on learning.\n\nBtw staff position is a leadership role, so it requires technical and people skills. I have already discussed this at length in the career story I wrote. Essentially, I learned from failures and mentors who showed me the right path.\n\nBy the way, I write about people skills in Tech in my newsletter: [https://newsletter.techleadmentor.com/](https://newsletter.techleadmentor.com/)\n\nAlso feel free to message me your questions on LinkedIn :)",

He then showed me his old resume which looked similar to mine(simple projects, school projects, hackathon..). \n\nThen he tells me his projects are all cloned projects off GitHub. He stalked people that got FAANG internships or currently work there and search for their GitHubs and clone projects. He even faked his volunteer experience and school clubs. I was pretty pissed off but just laughed it off with this guy.\n\nHe minimally studied the projects and hoped he didn\u2019t get questioned about them too much for interviews. He got 3 FAANG interviews/OAs and multiple other interviews from mid-size companies. He\u2019s a leetcode grinder so technical interviews or assessments weren\u2019t a problem for him. \n\nNow that he got a FAANG internship, he\u2019s basically set to get better opportunities in the future. He\u2019ll eventually only have internships on his resume and he\u2019ll probably get a return offer before grad. \n\nIf this guy used his normal resume he probably wouldn\u2019t get any of those interviews and would be in a similar situation as me.

            "So, here's the thing.  Some people cheat and lie.  Some people have no problem with it because they don't value being honest and see relationships as an opportunity for gain.  Some people do it but feel severe anxiety over it but are too insecure in their worth as a human being to live up to their own values.\n\nUltimately, the people who are okay with justifying lying and cheating typically also do well behaviorally on interviews since they tend to be manipulative.  This is just one small area they'll have an advantage.  Someone who finds lying acceptable isn't pleasant to have any sort of long term relationship with, work or otherwise.  They're not trustworthy, and social relationships are built on trust.\n\nAnyone who believes you need to lie or take advantage of others or cheat to be successful should consider what it is about themselves they find lacking that they don't think they'll be successful by being authentic and genuine.\n\nSince this is a common thread topic: sure, you can cheat on code assessments and not get caught, but in the end you'll have to live with yourself knowing you couldn't do it on your own.  Sounds like the start of imposter syndrome to me.\n\nSure, like OP's classmate, you can lie on your resume to make it more impressive than you actually are, but then you'll need to cope with the fear of being found out and fired, the fact you as your authentic self couldn't get the interview, and have sacrificed your character for silly ego fodder.  Sounds like another source of potential imposter syndrome.\n\nNo one can take your integrity from you but yourself, but the moment you let it go, you also need to accept you find yourself not good enough and wish you were a better version of yourself that you believe you are unable or unwilling to become.  Just do the work to be the better version of yourself.  It's a lot less work, effort, and stress than keeping up buckets of lies.  Really, anyone justfying this, please seek therapy before entering a long term relationship with anyone other than your laptop.  Campuses often offer free sessions through their clinical psychology programs.  You're just fine as you are.",

We were tasked with creating an API, which I thought was different from data science, but my bosses assured me that it was an important step in laying the pipelines for the project. So we create the API for the first few months, which is a few weeks behind schedule and suddenly my partner in the project leaves to go to another internship. The internship I'm doing is a two-parter, starting in the Spring and going through the Summer semester. My partner leaves the project at the end of the Spring term.\n\nAfter my partner left, I was doing a lot more work on stuff I didn't understand and got little work done. I was losing interest in the project and was very confused about what I should do. I felt like quitting since I was being put under a lot of pressure to finish the project by the deadline to present our results plus the stress of taking 3 very challenging summer courses (Algo, Software Design lab, and Programming Langs).\n\nI should note that I was not without blame. Throughout the internship, I made about 3 miscommunications which warranted some hefty emails from my bosses telling me what I did wrong and how to fix it. I should also note, that my bosses were some of the most professional, patient, and intelligent people I've met, so working under them was a great opportunity. No shade to them at all. I just don't think we were a great fit to work together. They pointed out how I didn't understand what Data Science was. I wanted to work at a lab or something with a small team or with a professor, but I think the company environment didn't do me justice.\n\nAn hour ago, they asked me to hop on a call and tell me that they no longer want to continue this internship. I felt like this relieved a lot of stress for me, but I also felt a bit down cause I just got fired for the first time in my life.\n\nTo sum it all up, I got fired because of a combination of lacking interest, losing a critical team member, and an environment I wasn't expecting.\n\nWhat should I do now?

            "Lol why are people attacking the intern. As long as you put some effort, it is okay to be confused and not know what you\u2019re doing, including even some miscommunication. The company posted the position and by doing that, signaled they were ready to train an intern at a loss (like almost all interns). Especially with this economy, it does suck when a company overestimates their capacity to have interns, but the fault here is really on the company (but I don\u2019t blame them, sometimes it\u2019s unavoidable).

I honestly don't think taking 3 classes while doing a summer internship is a great idea, esp since the work you put in vs. what you get out is not linear (prob some exp or quadratic curve)\n\nI made that mistake in the past and disappointed some folks.

If you didn\u2019t have those three courses, you could have dedicated your time entirely to the internship, and prob done a lot better. I don\u2019t think this was a skill issue. Anyone whose skilled would still suffer and struggle, given the fact that they have to go home to 3 courses for school. Maybe you had a reason for why you took those courses. Just learn from it and move on.

Losing a team member, you still could\u2019ve done a lot, at-least 50% of the work. \n\nLacking interest, seems like you don\u2019t like the work of a data scientist.

We'd be placed teams and assigned a company where we'd contribute to one of their internal projects.\n  \nA useful skill is learning how to climb over walls of uncertainty. Our project used new tech that was unfamiliar to us and our superiors. I had to relearn how to do independent research in a CS context and make friends in related communities.",
            "Are you a data science student or a computer science student? The reason I ask is I just finished up data fellowship that started in late spring and our team was a mix of CS and data backgrounds and I noticed the cs students struggled trying to figure out where to fit in and in the end after 12 weeks submitted basically nothing to the project.   \n\n\nWe had to write api's in order to get out ETL pipeline to work and I had hope they'd be more useful for that part of the project since they had bragged about their coding skills. In the end I think the project just wasn't what they were hoping for and since it was a volunteer fellowship they basically just peaced out.\n\nThere seems to always be this idea that if you want to get into data you should do a computer science degree but people neglect to mention that you'll probably also have to learn all the relevant skills on the side in order to be ready. \n\nA lot of data work ends up being more data engineering than it is analysis.",

The fact that you don't even mention this in your OP is a sign you don't know how to behave in a workplace. \n\nFew interns are fired just for technical errors, bc few employers have very high expectations of interns. Very few bosses have time to write lengthy emails to interns unless there is something off. It was only after I saw \"missing meetings\" that a light went off.\n\nI would take a hard look at whether this was a data science issue, or an issue with your communication skills.

I have a lot of friends who graduate with Masters and PhDs in quantitative social sciences (econ, political science, etc.) that get jobs with the title \"Data Scientist\" and they, nor I (who have that same overall skillset as them) would not even know where to begin in building an API. Its pretty weird to think that you would have the same person building the API to collect a singular set of data that you would employ to engage in simulation, predictive modeling, etc.  \n\n\nIt kind of sounds like you ended up in the wrong internship tbh - I'm sorry you had that experience!",

I'm a full stack that work heavily with a data science team and they're all python developers and while I influence the end structure of the data based on what info the app needs to consume, they are responsible to transform all incoming data streams according to the business case and will create data pipelines to make the data available to me. I could do that coding but I lack the educational mathematic background to know what algorithms and approach to use to answer certain questions,  (as you know, it requires specific expertise)\n\nIt sounds like you're looking for a position in academia or r&d",

Interns might do actual work in which case they might get offered something fulltime, and the company should look for interns who can do actual work in the hiring process, but if the company doesn't plan on its interns being unproductive, it shouldn't be hiring interns.
