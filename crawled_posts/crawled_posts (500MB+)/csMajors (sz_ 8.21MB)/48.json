Our CS program is nothing to write home about.\n\nAfter a fun internship, I got a new grad offer at a top 50 Fortune 500 non-tech company. Fully remote, in an LCOL area. TC isn\u2019t crazy, but my company is relatively immune to layoffs and my WLB is fantastic. \n\nIt\u2019s not FAANG. I don\u2019t make 200K as a new grad. But I got a job, I\u2019m a software engineer, and I work for a great company. \n\nFor everyone panicking about \u201co noooooo I can\u2019t get a 200K FAANG job in this market where 100K people have been laid off and I\u2019m worthless and I\u2019ll never make it bsjilsmtjfjckw,\u201d don\u2019t panic. Jobs and internships are definitely out there. As long as you land somewhere, you\u2019ll be perfectly fine.\n\nFAANG will always be there, but there are other companies out there as well where you\u2019ll still make way more than the average household in the US, even in LCOL. \n\nBe happy, don\u2019t stress, and keep working hard. If you land a job/internship this year, you\u2019ve got one over thousands of other students in the US.\n\nGood luck to all!",

It sucks seeing people you\u2019re smarter than and work harder than get lucky with FAANG while you got unlucky with life and the economy. Lots of people work extremely hard to get their resume to where it\u2019s at, and definitely deserve that high TC out of college.

We are currently at no risk of laying off folks, and in general, they would cut higher up bonuses before laying people off. \n\nI don\u2019t make 200k tc, but I still make a good base and bonus, and I\u2019m not going to need to look for a new job. Which is honestly a much greater value at this point than a bigger TC package. \n\nThere are so many other jobs out there that pay well/have good benefits/learning opportunities outside of FAANG. While jobs at a FAANG company can set you up for success, that doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t plenty of other good jobs outside of it.

Basically people think that skill progression is like the movie. You get a crash course on karate from a mysterious mentor for a few months and suddenly you can win a tournament. When really it's more like you train for a bit, lose a bunch of tournaments really badly, then maybe, just maybe you start getting bronze and silver medals and then maybe if you're really good you get a gold occasionally. \n\nTranslating that to work, you can't expect to gain so much knowledge and get a job after only a few months. People work at programming for years before they get fancy jobs. Sure, some people do genuinely get big N jobs with little experience, but I don't think you should feel *bad* if you don't get it. And unless you're really working hard at programming, you won't suddenly get better than others.",

I know it sucks to say this when most people will be saying \"I'm sorry\", but you should change your strategy.  \nBased on your comments, you don't have internship experience, and you are a senior in college.  \nI don't have internship experience as well, I'm a freshman in a community college and I managed to get an offer for 2024, and secured an offer for 2025, both in big companies, I also interviewed in 3 more good companies.   \nI applied to 100 internships, but from the time I secured the 2 offers I had only received answer from 40 companies.   \nI'm not saying this to discourage you, but I like to be frank, there has to be something wrong, because no one needs to apply to 450 jobs, even 100 felt like a lot of applications for me, and I started applying to some random stuff at some point. It's a waste of time and resources, and you probably should have been allocating those more wisely. That's probably why things are not going well with the job applications, I bet between those 450, most are random companies, old job posts, super competitive linkedin jobs, etc...   \n\n\nI wish you good luck, that you find an internship. It's not over yet, and a lot of companies are emailing me saying that they will be reviewing candidates on january-march. I saw a lot of internship job postings that opened on december. But now, before applying, make a good resume, yours is not good, if you want help with that, message me.  \nIf you end up not finding an internship, use the rest of your university semester to make a very good project, that actually challenges you, a complex system, something that impresses. Also, try to work on projects with other developers, this is recommended because it's an actual experience, way better than personal projects, and it can be through open source contribution as well. I didn't have team experience, just 2 very good personal projects, which I could elaborate very well about them, and that was what made me get the offers. From your resume I don't know if your projects are not complex enough or if you just are not elaborating well about them, and I think it's the second option.",

It\u2019s to let you know that sometimes we accept bad results if we think they are normal. \n\nMy tips are -\n\nHave LinkedIn activity so if a company views your profile they can see you discuss your projects, achievements, etc.\n\nTailor your resume. Most interviews I got were ones with tailored resumes. Move their desired language to the front of your languages list. Include new/different bullet points to highlight a skill that aligns and even change out different projects. I had multiple types of resumes (SWE, Data, IT) and each of those had multiple versions IE  for data science positions I had: data science, data engineer, and machine learning resumes.\n\nObviously make sure your resume is good IE layout, word choice, scalability, etc.\n\nCold message alumni from your school that work at a place you applied, or if there\u2019s no alum just message someone with the same position. Now don\u2019t just beg for a referral. Briefly introruce yourself and say you really want to work there and wanted to ask them a couple questions to prepare for an interview. If you seem genuine and personable 9/10 times they will refer you without asking."

I visited their home office and there are these terminals to use. I would have to learn it on my own, they will pay me full salary to learn it because no one teaches it very much any more.

            "COBOL is an old language, designed to be somewhat English like. It is procedural, rather than OO. Although OO COBOL exists I have never once seen it.\n\nThere is a mountain of COBOL code out there, likely more than any other language. Popular in banking and insurance in particular. You'll find that maintenance and integration will fill your days. Constantly tweaking the code to keep up with legislation and business changes.\n\nDepending on the culture you'll find the company risk averse, and yet having very little in the way of test cases. Almost everything is based on institutional knowledge, which is leaving the company rapidly. You'll have to own it and grow quickly. It won't be pretty but it is well paid. FWIW I loved the challenge.\n\nAlso every single company I know of is trying to shed this workload, so expect to be constantly being asked to do more with less and dealing with outsourcing.

            "DO IT! NO EXCUSES, FIGURE IT OUT. There are so many legacy systems that are still using COBOL, and their average ages of developers are in their 50s. If you can do whatever it takes to learn COBOL, you can write your own ticket/paycheck. 10-15 years from now those guys will have passed on or retired, and the companies still using COBOL won\u2019t have any developers that can work on their systems.

They\u2019re so big that they can\u2019t afford to refactor everything in their system to newer languages, hence why they still use COBOL. \n\nJust watch. The demand for developers who know COBOL will rise in the next 10-15 years, probably just as much as SWE has blown up over the past 5.

I had been working on an open-source project called chrollo (you can see it on github [here](https://github.com/wuon/chrollo)) and basically built it over the weekend after finding a bash based version of it. In a nutshell, you can watch anime\u2026 from your CLI xD\n\nAnyways, the whole conversation happened while exchanging formalities where he had asked me what I did over the weekend. I really didn\u2019t want to do another coding interview so I just YOLO\u2019d it and asked if he watched anime. When he said \u201cyes\u201d I knew it was time to take a shot and unload my weebness.\n\nI ended up spending the next hour talking about the tool I built and demoing it to him. He seemed to really enjoy it and was interested on how I scraped the information + streamed the video. Because of our conversation, we didn\u2019t have time for the coding problem and it just left at that.\n\nA couple hours later, I got an invitation to move on to the next round! I found it super refreshing that some companies don\u2019t always require a coding challenge. Although showcasing a project doesn\u2019t work for every company like the Big N, it was super cool to see my local startup moving forward with me even though I didn\u2019t do their coding problem.\n\nWell, at least they know I watch anime...",

Getting into med school is incredibly competitive because people want that doctor/surgeon pay. Well according to 2020-2023 TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, etc., CS has a higher pay, better WLB, and less barrier to entry. It's obvious why supply of SWEs is going up.\n\n**Why SWE Demand Decreased:**\n\nCompanies had lots of money during COVID years. Companies spent frivolously and overhired software engineers. Companies no longer have the same kind of money because COVID was a global phenomenon that altered the markets in a way that cannot be replicated. They can no longer afford to hire as many software engineers.\n\n**TL;DR** \\- Things aren't going to change. Lay-offs will decrease, but breaking into the field will be as hard as it is now, and it's only getting harder each year as more people graduate. CS is still an incredible valuable degree though, as there are lots of other non-SWE CS fields that are great careers.",

        "selftext": "Thought I\u2019d provide some advice in everyone\u2019s job search, specifically Entry Level/New Grad. I\u2019m not an expert, just saying what worked for me. \n\nI had been applying since April this year for entry level full time software engineering positions. I probably did 50+ applications per week since then. I was still in school throughout the summer and didn\u2019t have time to leetcode. But I noticed the interviews were never like leetcode, more like CS trivia. Therefore I created a Techinical Question CS trivia study guide as well as writing down all the common Behavioral Questions and reviewing everything before each interview. Never got any offers and was getting depressed and broke.\n\nOne day I was on a date looking out at my city\u2019s skyline at night and realized that all the company\u2019s in all the skyscrapers did NOT post any jobs on any job board I was on. I then, immediately after the date, went on all of their company career sites and every single one had entry level software engineering jobs posted! One company happened to be the largest employer in my state and had around 5 entry level software engineer positions posted!! All of the companies were healthcare, banking, and consulting industries which is probably why they have money and time to invest in New Grads, try to aim for these industries!\n\n I couldn\u2019t believe it and applied to all of them. 2 weeks later they gave me an offer I accepted \ud83d\ude0a which was one of the best days of my life tbh. Anyway, just wanted to not only share my success story but also provide some insight on other ways to job search. Sometimes the answer is right in front of you the whole time.\n\nEDIT: Just wanted to add that I accepted an offer from a healthcare company and even renegotiated my salary to a number I\u2019m happy with! \n\nThe key takeaway I feel like is just apply to companies that don\u2019t post to LinkedIn Jobs, Indeed, etc cause then you have A LOT LESS competition. I remember I was interviewing for a medical device company via a recruiter reaching out to me. Then they posted the job everywhere and ghosted me..\n\nIf anyone wants to know my Technical CS Trivia Questions, they were literally just basic OOP and Python questions. The behavioral questions were also just basic ones you hear all the time. Having everything written out with your answers helps ALOT when preparing. After many interviews, I simply became very good at answering them and I think the company was satisfied enough to just give me an offer almost right away without any follow up interview which is unbelievable!
