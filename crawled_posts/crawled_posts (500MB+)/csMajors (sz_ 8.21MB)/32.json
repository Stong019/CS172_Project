I could write a whole page about my time there, so I\u2019ll stick to the main points. \n- It\u2019s a window manufacturer that also does installation on a retail level. \n- They employ 100-150 people, most of which are manufacturing employees. \n- After working as an installer for many years I became the installation manager. \n\nGiven that, I know the inner workings of this smaller company and have rare insight into the executive process since my only boss was the president of the company. \nHis goal was always to pay as little as possible, and blend roles. No one at a position of authority had a job description, including me. Sometimes that\u2019s good, sometimes it\u2019s very frustrating because we did have titles. For instance as installation manager, one would think that my primary responsibility is the installation dept, and it was, except I also had to help ensure that the product was built in time for me honor my schedule with customers. I found myself having to more or less become a plant manager as well. It was always a huge stressor calling people to remind them of their install knowing their product wasn\u2019t even ready and likely wouldn\u2019t be until the day before, the morning of, or many times as the installation is actively going on. \nI only go into this much detail, because at a certain point they decided they better update their software systems and anyone with a CS degree that applied was scoffed at due to the amount of money they wanted. He ended up hiring a 20 year old kid with an associates in CIS to modernize their systems and paid him  $18 an hour to do it.\nThat\u2019s small business for you though. It\u2019s how many hats can you wear for the lowest price. \nAfter 3 years of banging my head against the wall I quit and went back to contracting. I make way more money, although the physical work is much harder. Also, I ruptured my biceps tendon shortly after making the switch. I set my schedule  so I enrolled in college after recovering and started in CS. I switched to Cybersecurity because I enjoy the hacking aspect of it more, and my goal is to become a pen tester. \nAnyway, it ended up being a whole page, but I\u2019ve got good insight into this situation from a position of authority.",

        "selftext": "Some thoughts and reflections\n\n- you only have to get lucky once - keep applying. The more darts you throw at the board, the more likely you are to hit a bullseye. Cast a broad net, you never know which random opportunities might work out. I ended up getting my offer in a country I\u2019ve never been to.\n\n- Separate the process from your self-worth and eradicate imposter syndrome. Not having an offer yet doesn\u2019t make you underqualified or worse than those who do. Continue enjoying life in the meantime and don\u2019t fall into the trap of grinding and being stressed until you get an offer - don\u2019t fall into the trap of engaging in the vicious cycle of permanently treating your current life as a transition period while you wait for some big change or achievement to all of a sudden make things better. You\u2019ll stay stuck in that rat race mindset and perpetually forget to live in the moment.\n\n- spend hours on your resume. Read tips, check sample resumes, use a good template. This one-page document is the main way you sell yourself. You get far better return on investment when working on improving it vs. doing just about anything else. Make sure an external reader can get a good grasp of what you did through the bullet points and what you achieved by doing these things, without getting bogged down in details. Doesn\u2019t matter how good you are at interviewing if you\u2019re not passing resume screens. Sell yourself, embellish your projects and experience within reason, and don\u2019t feel bad about doing it. Everyone else is, and you\u2019re just operating at a disadvantage if you don\u2019t. Recruiting is an exercise in marketing and you\u2019re the product. Don\u2019t worry about feeling like you bullshitted your way into a job that you\u2019re under-qualified for - most people feel that way and you likely underestimate your ability to quickly pick up relevant skills on the job. \n\n- practice leetcode. You don\u2019t need to be a god, but just get better than you were before. If your university has a programming challenge or competitive programming course, take it. You\u2019d be surprised at how far you can get just with a firm handling of arrays, hash sets and a decent recognition of patterns from previously solved problems. Try to get to a point where you can solve most easiest in under 5-10 minutes and can tackle most mediums in <30 min. This is especially important for OAs.\n\n- Talk during your technical interviews. Don\u2019t ever sit there trying to figure something out without constantly communicating your active thought process. Interviews are professional yap sessions - painting yourself as a personable communicator gives you a massive leg up even against more technically inclined competitors. When your interviewer gives you direction or hints at an approach, they\u2019re not failing you - work with them and interface with the ideas they\u2019re giving you. By doing so, you show an ability to handle and act on feedback and demonstrate the abilities that are most relevant to the job as an intern or junior engineer.\n\n- I cannot understate this one enough. If you\u2019re in your senior/last year, are struggling to find junior full time roles, and are lucky enough to be in a position where an extra semester is affordable, APPLY TO INTERNSHIPS AS WELL. Make a second resume with a grad date that\u2019s a semester later. Bars are lower for internships, and while a lot of companies cut down on new grad hiring during downturns, internship programs remain their primary way of assessing and recruiting junior engineers. You\u2019ll get to come out of university more qualified, with an extra internship under your belt. Besides, you have your whole life to work full time - don\u2019t be in more of a rush to get started than you need to be. An extra bonus is that you\u2019ll in all likelihood get to then eventually search for new grad gigs in an improved market down the line. This also ties back to my first point - by widening your scope to both internships and full time jobs, you pretty much double your odds of successfully landing an offer. Maximize your odds of getting lucky.  As you increase sample size, getting an offer goes from plausible to probable.",

I open it up the next day and its a giant whiteboard of tasks I have to do. \n\nI applied for the fullstack internship so I had to do both the front end and backend assessments (WITHIN 48 Hours!). So I took a look at them and the front end assessment was to make a dynamic website with music playing in the background and dynamic cursor and a bevy of other bullshit. OK fine, I look at the backend assessment and it says to make a twitter clone API with user login, unit tests for each endpoint, creating and updating tweets, the whole shabang. And the wording of it was so aggressive too. They tell you to make the APIs for the user login first and they end it with \"These APIS MUST BE PERFECT, DO NOT MOVE ON TO THE REST OF THE ASSESSMENT WITHOUT COMPLETING THIS OR **YOUR ASSESSMENT WILL NOT BE SCORED**!!\" \n\nSo yeah exited out of that assessment real fast.
