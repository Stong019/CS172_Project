No.\n\nI get it, it's the process that matters. That is, you thought it was going to be hard, you were struggling and now you figured it out. That's cool, I get it.\n\nBut when you know that ChatGPT can just do what you did in a matter of seconds, it just takes that feeling away. Because why waste time when you can be efficient by using ChatGPT?\n\nSure, you can work away at a solution but that's not going to be practical at work either. At work, you need to try and be efficient.\n\nTo me, when I know that ChatGPT can solve a problem in seconds, I just feel the coding knowledge I have is not so useful. I know, I can solve something but ChatGPT can do it 5 times faster and can even give a solution that's 5 times more efficient.\n\nAnd so then, who are you at the end of the day? Someone that took time to solve it. And how is that useful? How are you beneficial?\n\nPersonally, instead of solving different problems, I enjoy doing like a project since that takes creativity because you are using different tech stacks and trying to create something you want to make. At least this involves a lot more thinking than just solving a problem.\n\nBut funnily enough, there is AI that can make a simple full stack app for instance, which is someone's project. And then you just feel useless because of that. \n\nBut that's how I feel.\n\nIf you feel good, then that's what matters.",

It's just a matter of creativity or expense. There's always a way. Now sometimes something can't be solved *within the constraints* like time or money, but there's always a solution if you have enough of either."

        "selftext": "Not gonna lie. I wasn't going to write this post but something changed after reading comments over the last so many posts about finding jobs and interns. I'm in the same boat as these people and this really sucks. Interestingly, with all the negativity in the comment sections, somehow it is actually calming in our chaotic semesters. It feels nice to not be the only person who's going through this.\n\nBut the one thing that's keeping me together is the fact that I am just waiting it out. I was a sophomore last semester and I'm pretty sure I am applied to 100+ companies, and I started early too. My friends were getting coding challenges, interviews, while I was getting rejection emails after emails. I still knew that somehow I would land an internship even though it was already February. By the time we had arrived in February, my friends had already given up. They had given up to a point where they didn't even go to the career fairs for the spring semester. I still believed so I did. That was the best decision ever because I got in touch with two recruiters, one of them moved forward with an interview and I clutched it. Right before college shut down due to COVID. I waited for the moment and when I got it, everything just started to work out for me.\n\nThe point being, it doesn't matter what's going on. By stressing yourself about what's gonna happen in the future, you're stressing yourself two times. Just wait out. You got a rejection? Who cares, apply to two more then. But just don't give up. Nothing's wrong with you or your profile. You just need to wait for your chance and then pounce like a mother\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 1: Thank you so much everyone for welcoming this post and for the awards.

I still apply though, but more in a stoic way.\n\nI've been less stressed about internships itself, and more stressed about being under-qualified for the industry overall and my mediocre university CS experience so far.\n\nI graduate next year. At least I have some side projects but it definitely feels like a challenging road ahead.\n\nMaybe I should have went to a bootcamp and then got industry experience in less time  than I spent in college? who knows.",

And thus we have the meaningless obsession of prestige on the subreddit.  But the truth is they\u2019re only there because every faang, amazon most drastically, lowered their hiring bars.

But working at a startup revived my love of coding and building instead of endless meetings. The majority of people are also not just leetcode engineers which refreshing but the pay definitely doesn't match up unless your startup IPOs which I've been fortunate to experience :)\n\nLet me post my whole text chunk, it's about being a senior dev but it's also about my experience working at faang.\n\nI've met wayyy too many senior engineers who say they're working on a design and spike, schedule 20 meetings each one about some overengineered shit, bringing up non existant security issues, addressing possible scaling needs that we wouldn't need to worry about 10 years down the line. Which would then reduce my working time by 20-40% cause I'm sitting in these useless design meetings arguing about something that we could've just feature flagged. They then would get a promo based on some over complicated shit and potential revenue that would wow leadership and then leave once they had to execute. Meanwhile I'm picking up the slack, fixing their breaking down the over engineered shit, and helping build the system out. I swear to god I never want to end up at faang or any company with greater than 1k employees. It just becomes such a shit hole of shitty devs who can interview really well, and want to make their mark by overcomplicating every little detail and think it's the norm because things move slowly anyways and every other senior engineer is doing it too.God bless the senior engineers that are good at designing shit without dragging their feet and god bless the amazing senior and staff engineers who would at least understand how to build what they were designing and helped me get to where I was now as a senior dev.If anyone is going to write an O Reilly book please write a book saying there is no one right way to become a good dev and especially not a good senior dev. If you think not coding at all is the hallmark of every good senior dev, then I think we've gone too far into a dark path. And it's almost self fufilling because these shitty devs have created an environment where I literally can't code cause my schedule is filled from 10 am to 3 pm with meeting X, review meeting Y, product review meeting, meeting about why we can't put this header in this API call, why this design doesn't follow X pattern, How do we scale up to 3k rps while we only are expecting 50 rps, choosing the right cloud infra when there is no reason not to reuse what we've used the last year and a half.",
            "Big tech was prestige back when Google had, \"don't be evil\" as a moto. It's been shit ever since.",
            "As a CS outsider (Industrial Engineering) I always thought it was wierd how much y'all focus on big tech like you do. There's so much opportunity out there in a variety of industries where you can work on so much cool stuffm Working in jewelry and firearms manufacturing I've gotten to work on plenty of cool stuff without having to suffer through a big tech interview \n\nBig tech got y'all whipped into grinding leetcode in your free time like fuck if I'm gonna practice designing tooling or something in my free time",
            "Faang was the best gig for contractors. All the money, none of the suffering. Especially if they were in a hurry to form a team and get started asap, they basicaly wrote blank checks just to get people.",
            "Focus on who pays the most. Prestige can be leveraged but go for the money.\n\nAlso the diversified tech companies (msft, amazon, Apple) are doing smaller layoffs which is normal for most companies.\n\nYou are mistaken if you think layoffs only happen in tech. Part of the reason tech layoffs are getting so much attention is because a lot of them have been immune to layoffs due to hyper growth. \n\nThis is coming from someone who worked in non tech and now works in faang.",
            "People will be going to the top universities, study science and work their ass off just to become an employee. Do you maybe see an issue here?! Big tech job is a glorified factory job.",
            "Being in FAANG is the same way I view Ivys. Some of the smartest people in the world probably work there, but it\u2019s so inflated by people either engineering their entire lives just to get there or people with connections that don\u2019t reflect their skills that it doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019d be much more impressed by an entrepreneur who sold for 100k than someone who works for a FAANG company role playing as a software engineer while attending culture meetings for half of the day making 100k.",
            "I mean, personall, I never wanted to work at a big name tech company. I want to work someplace local that has opportunities to increase my skills.",
            "TC or gtfo",
            "Yeah there's plenty of other companies that actually treat their employees well and you don't have to worry about constantly being laid off.",
            "Literally how I feel rn",
            "This sub poisoned my mind. I went to my state school career fair and learned there were multiple companies in my area that would start around 6 figures, have 1/100th of the competition of FAANG and they don't even have coding assessments. None of them have even opened applications for the summer internships yet...relax everyone. Its going to be ok.",
            "Honestly I never understood why people would prefer to sell their souls to FAANG when they could get the same paychecks with less workload, and better recession resistance elsewhere.",
            "I tried not to make Big Tech my goal because I'm a nontraditional student. I wasn't sure if I was qualified enough to compete against all the students who came from the the big name comp science schools. So I lowered my expectations. I don't even have my bachelor's degree. I'm currently working on it. I have college credits from when I decided to pursue my RN.\nI've been looking into getting a government job as a SWE. \nBig Tech is so unstable right now. I just read where Twitter canceled 4400 contracts. When it's good, it's good when it's bad then it just dies",
            "Tech has been gimmicky for a long time. Some apps are so bloated it\u2019s amazing they don\u2019t burst.",
            "Yes the more they layoff people, the less people will want to work there. This will kill the companies prestige. Some people like working at prestigious companies, but really prestige matters for your resume",
            "So true! The recent news and grind for a small chance leads me to think that the grass is not always greener on the other side.",
            "It's been stable for the past 15 years",
            "I've worked for a small software partner for a decade. great work life balance and great money. they work you to death at FAANG. Every year someone around 27-28 comes over to our side and goes \"wow, this is so nice not working 60+ hour weeks and on weekends.\" i just smh.",
            "Lockheed, Northrup, Raytheon fucking jojo posing now",
            "No, stop.\nLet the sweats all focus for the \u201cFAANG\u201d jobs. Keep them in their oversaturated market.\n\nI want less competition in the less known companies.",
            "I\u2019m sick and tired of people referring to \u201cFAANG\u201d all the time. The only reason those get grouped together is because it sounds like a word and now it\u2019s just a word people can throw around",
            "it\u2019s always been adult daycare.. I hope this downturn reminds of the importance of hard work and developing real skills",
            ">After all of the layoffs, does anyone else feel like working at a big tech company is just so unreliable and has lost its prestige?\n\nNo.\n\nLayoffs happen in cycles, and it is common to see them on Q4.\n\nOnce you work long enough in this crap, you learn to see the patterns and stop trying to read the tea leaves, and find deeper meaning in any of it.\n\nAlso, you don't work for **prestige**. You work for money and for enhancing your skills. Anyone who works in this for the prestige is doing it for the wrong (and unsustainable) reasons, and I would not take such a person seriously.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS. yes, I know, I'm being judgemental.",
            "Dude, Amazon came to campus my freshman year and talked about ppl staying late for dinner and playing ping pong. It is a daycare, that\u2019s why I\u2019m pursuing quant rn. Research in finance or even in academia is way more fulfilling than Big Tech.",
            "Always has been...",
            "sounds like ur coping",
            "I\u2019m working at a mid size company. Super underrated; decent pay, decent bonus structure. Get to do tons of awesome projects with full ownership. Very little red tapes on what you can and cannot do, every engineer can make a huge impact to business.",
            "Everything has its pros and cons.  You could work at the government level or defense contractor and probably do very boring work, but make decent pay with great stability as long as you aren\u2019t a complete goof.\n\nOr, you could work at \u201cbig\u201d tech or some exciting private sector company on something more exciting, potentially make more money but face more volatility.  Trade offs.",
            "Brother it's not the prestige it's the compensation. A faang engineer is making double my salary prob and long term their stocks are going to outgrow my shitty stocks from my company.\n\nImagine working 6 months and earning what I make in a year or as you get more pretigous titles/positions you make in 3 months what someone makes in a year. You gain so much of your time back and accumulate so many more resources.",
            "yep.",
            "My company may not be super well-known, but at least I\u2019m not getting shit-canned next week lol.",
            "Forget big tech, even small tech has done nothing but ghosted me whenever I've completed their OA.",
            "I have a serveral friends that have worked at Cisco.  They were so proud and bragged about it to all their friends.  Flashed their business cards and corporate credit card at every opportunity. And very quick to remind you that cisco is (allegedly) one of the best employers out there.\n\nRight up until Cisco's 3rd quarter when they do lay-off regardless if the company is doing well or in the tank.",
            "Working for defense was always seen as boring and something not exciting. While maybe true, can\u2019t think of a more stable industry than defense, especially during these times of high tension and the war in Ukraine. Not to mention the military industrial complex the US has, defense will never go out of business or really suffer as much as big tech is suffering right now.",
            "So, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon... they all laid off people. Now what's next? Google? Funny thing is that other companies only want people who are laid off from these companies."
