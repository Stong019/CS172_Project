No technical rounds other than the hackerrank, just a conversation about technical skills with some senior software engineer leads. I honestly prefer it that way.\n\nOverall, I think I've gotten invited to around...6ish interviews out of 70 ish apps? I have previous swe experience at a small IT company and also research experience (which I 100% recommend you to do research at least once if you have the time, interviewers are always asking about my research and think it's cool lol).\n\nI have two projects on my resume, and both are full stack. One was a class e-commerce project, the other was a passion project making use of APIs and Flask, nothing too wild. \n\nOh, and I go to a state school, started programming my freshman year with no prior experience at all, didn't even know what CS was until the end of hs lmao.\n\nAnyway, I really do wish those of you still looking the best of luck, i know how rough it can be and how desperate it can leave you. If you have any questions, or wanna vent, feel free to DM, I'm always lurking on here. \n\nCheers",

            "Not too long ago I was targeted for suggesting the jobs still exist out there, but you needed to lower your starting expectations (location and pay).  That CS jobs in the future won't be too dissimilar to other engineering fields.  To start $70-80 is actually doing pretty good, and then after working for 15-20 years being closer to $200-$250k total comp is reasonable for the average engineer (ME, EE, Mfg., QA) so why would it be that different for CS?  With the rise of AI and assisted programing this is even more likely to be the case.  That seemed impossible to some with the idea that starting at $150-200k is normal, less is a huge disaster, and further out in your career it would be towards $500k.  I just don't see it working out that way unless you are a VP level or you are absolutely essential to the fundamental technical value of a company.  Everyone starts somewhere.",

        "selftext": "I wanted to share my personal experience as this is something that I had previously beaten myself up over. For some context, I'm a class of 2020 graduate currently working for a popular search engine.\n\nTo put it simply, outside of my courswork I've never given much of a crap about CS or anything going on in the software development scene. Unlike peers I've found myself jealous of, I never had the motivation to do anything dev-related in my free time. All of the projects listed on my resume were for class finals and I'm among the worst offenders when it comes to buying a project domain then never touching it. I have zero familiarity in anything modern and 'exciting' like React or app development or ML (or even github before I started work). \n\nMy senior year when I was still job-hunting I remember horrendously mispronouncing Kubernetes to a FAANG-bound classmate (who could talk to you for hours about Kubernetes and Docker and React, etc.) and thinking to myself that my disinterest in CS had killed my chances of achieving their level of success (that same classmate and I work together now).\n\nDespite my lack of motivation I found myself able to receive two solid offers due to the usual leetcode grind and having strong grades plus some years of mundane freelance Wordpress development. Looking back, I realize that my lack of passion never really held me back as much as I thought it did. I do fine in my job (which involves working on an in-house C++ framework) and I could learn something like Angular if I needed to. At this point I've pretty much accepted that I'm only going to touch code 9\u20135 for the rest of my life and I have plenty of other hobbies that capture my interest.\n\nIt goes without saying that passion for CS can go a loooong way for a new grad, especially if your interests and skills align with those a potential team or you have a knock-your-socks-off personal project to showcase. But for those of you who are in my boat, it's important to recognize that it's not a requirement.",

Did you take easy courses that gave out easy As?  How could someone with high motivation and interest not do as well or better?  \n\nConversely, I wonder if in some cases a lack of interest could actually be a boon because you don't come in with your own agenda and ideas.  You're totally willing to work without distraction on someone else's project, and just do as instructed.  A new employee who has particular interests, possibly even chasing the bleeding edge, might be too hard to make focus on daily tasks.",

If you tell anyone what your job is, they will respond with \"oh cool, my 8-year-old is learning programming\". If they know anyone in tech doing for loops or even IT, they think you're both doing the same job and are of equal talent.

Nothing wrong with that, but in the grand scheme of things 18% is not all that bad of a number at all. It seems like everyone and their mother is doing cs these days because there is no difference between a stanford cs student at a northeastern cs student. Both have the exact same opportunities and frankly, most companies especially big tech give no extra weighting to the stanford brand for generic swe roles.
