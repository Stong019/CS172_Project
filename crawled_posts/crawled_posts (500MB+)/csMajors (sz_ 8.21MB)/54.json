            "It's just the job market right now. No one is hiring interns/new grads. Keep at it; it's still early October. Some of my friends last year didn't sign until March.",
            "I do not usually write on this subreddit but this caught my attention. I am on the other side of the spectrum, I did a bunch of internships for big tech companies and when I speak with people having your problem they dismiss me saying I couldn\u2019t understand their frustration. But I do, It wasn\u2019t a smooth ride until here, I know how it feels to get rejected.\n\nThe thing is that even if you do everything you\u2019re supposed to: get referrals, maximize algorithmic skills, tweak the CV. There is still a big part of it that is pure randomness. Recruiters are just struggling to justify their own existence, there are lots of nonsensical decisions being made, some tech companies do not even know why they are hiring, they interview for things that nobody is going to use in the real world and the list goes on.\n\nIt is very easy to slip into madness in this situation, to play a number\u2019s game: hunt jobs 24/24, apply for hundreds of positions and get obsessed with it. I know it\u2019s cliche but in my opinion the solution might be a matter of attitude. Try to rediscover the fun of programming, not working on side projects because it\u2019s good on CV but because it is a fun thing to do. I know it\u2019s an easy thing to say but you cannot pay the bills with side projects and I completely agree. You need to keep your head above the water one way or another, you might try freelancing: it's low gain until you build a customer base but might pay a part of the bills, you might have some jobs available on your campus for students. I remember back in high school repairing computers for some extra cash. I know people who were simply walking inside local businesses asking them if they want a site or an online shop. It is a struggle but important to keep intrinsic motivation up, is the only tool you have to get by.\n\nDo not think the grinding path will stop once you land a job, on a lower level the same thing it\u2019s happening inside a company: workers hierarchy, who are performing better than the other, who is going for a promotion, who is going to be fired. You need to leave behind grinding or it will follow your whole life. With the risk of being cliche again: in the end it\u2019s not a number\u2019s game, it\u2019s not about how many hackathons you won or side projects you did, it\u2019s about their stories, it\u2019s about how they made you feel, it\u2019s about the people who life was affected by the things you\u2019ve build. Learn to enjoy the ride and do not think of these years as wasted. Your work doing what you love as side projects is not less valuable than the work done by engineers at Amazon, Google or Facebook. I\u2019ve been in lots of big tech teams these years and meet lots of wonderful people. I assure they wouldn\u2019t look down on you so neither should you.",
            "I got offer height Cov-19 last summer same boat. I hit 220+ apps before getting offer. My best advice it you just want internship focuse on these 3 industries  defense contractor, medical, and retail easier industries. Keep applying but I didnt start really getting good until I did little things like change interview tactics, write down good and bad things, record interviews to see later etc. Also constantly revising resume to your at least getting an interview every 10-15 resumes you sent out. It's hard but if you really want winners find a way to win and losers give up. PM if you want breakdown of different tactics that increased my chances.",

Have you applied to these?",
            "Just relax dude, the times that we live in currently are not working in our favor. Most employers are doing layoff to people who have worked so many years in the same company. So just take that in perspective. Also you are us citizen so try to apply to all the defense and aerospace companies like l3harris, Boeing, Lockheed, etc you might find good luck there. Also just some advice for mental stability is to go out in nature, exercise, eat healthy, have a good laugh with either friend or family, if that\u2019s not possible watch funny stuff online it will make you laugh which I think is the best medicine for any tough situation.

Jake\u2019s format anyone??? And holy whitespace btw. We are all 3rd+ years in the class as well. \n\nAye, I\u2019m not here to make fun of them though. It\u2019s just I feel as though if they were to join this sub, they would feel like giving up worse than ppl here already do with experience under their belt. Unless this sub just skewed my view on CS expectations? I firmly believe if some of y\u2019all saw the resumes I witnessed, y\u2019all would just start dying out of laughter.

However, most worked in unrelated things, myself included (I worked retail while in college.)\n\nIf I check them out on LinkedIn, about 50% managed to get software engineering jobs, the rest either went into IT, recruiting, and a minority couldn't make it at all.\n\nThe thing is, most of those jobs, aren't jobs you would want. They are jobs at subcontracting agencies or small local companies. And most importantly, they are jobs that **don't pay well**, and require on-site.\n\nThings are much harder these days, but I'm aware the 2023 grads didn't deviate too much from previous years. Most found jobs, but again they aren't the jobs you would want.\n\nThis sub, r/cscareerquestions and Team Blind for sure raise the bar and expectations.

At least show them how you think it could be done and how you work through solving a problem.",
            "As someone that didn\u2019t really grind leetcode before interviews started, just trust your education and apply the fundamentals to the problem. Talk them through your thought process, ask questions and just be personable.

            "[deleted]",
            "The genuine answer is to change the way you approach problems. Take the problem list from neetcode 75 and start with one pattern at time. Set a timer and work on it for twenty minutes. If you\u2019ve solved it / know how to solve it within that time, great. If not, go to the solutions, use a piece of paper and spend time writing it out and then solving it from those notes (should not take more than 10 minutes) then make note of it and come back to the problem between 24 and 48 hours later. Break this up into sessions of doing up to 3 leetcode problems at a time.\n\nFor general leetcode advice, obv start with clarifying questions in a real interview. I always like to use comments before I write any code. If I\u2019m stuck I write out brute force solution pseudo code (very short) and then try to figure out where the redundancy is and how I can use a different data structure or approach to mitigate that. If I\u2019m ever in a recursive problem I always start by writing return statement\n\nThis approach has worked very well for me",

            "Serious cope in the comments in this thread. Would you be in a better position if you had been practicing already? Of course. Can you improve your situation given a week of prep time? Obviously yes.\n\nPick a list of leetcode questions. You can use the Blind 75, Sean Prashad's list that's sorted by topic, or Neetcode's flow diagram of questions organized by topic. You could keep doing Grokking too. As long as you pick a well-curated list that covers the common topics.\n\nNow spam the questions, but the key is to only spend TWO MINUTES trying to think of the solution independently. If you can come up with a data structure and approach to solve it, go ahead and code it up. If you can't within TWO MINUTES you LOOK UP THE ANSWER. Implement it. Understand it. Go to the next question.\n\nWhy look up the answer so quickly? Because it's a waste of your limited time to attempt to invent the algorithm when your brain has never seen the patterns yet. Once you do 50 problems you'll start feeling like you're seeing the same approach solving problems that initially looked very different. Once you hit 100 questions you'll get confident in solving new problems you haven't seen before.\n\nWhen I was in the navy people used to panic the day before advancement exams and our seniors would tell them \"if you start studying today, it's already too late.\" Uhh, no? You can count on certain types of questions to make an appearance and if you study for half an hour you can handle at least those. \n\nThe best time to plant a tree is ten years ago. The second best time is today.\n\nDon't listen to the naysayers in this thread. They're projecting their inability to land an interview and all they can see is your lack of preparation. Fuck em and go kill your interview.\n\nFinal piece of advice: a couple of days before your interview practice verbalizing your thought process while solving a problem. This isn't an OA, it's a human to human dialogue. Even if you can't solve a problem an interviewer can be wowed if you can talk about time complexity, trade-offs between different approaches, and even the nuances of the language you're coding in. CLARIFY ANY AMBIGUITY. Show that you thought of some edge cases (easy ones are invalid input, null input, zero elements, one element, etc). Your soft skills are being tested even more than your technical ones. People want to hire someone who can communicate and isn't just a leetcode robot. \n\nDo a quick pass over the problems you've solved and see if you can lightning-round identify the data structure and algorithm used in the solution and the key idea of the problem that made that solution possible.\n\nGood luck.

Don't start coding straight away. Chunk it / whiteboard it and talk. Ask about edge cases. Confirm approach, discuss time complexity. They might drop you hints.\n2. You can paper / whiteboard induction I.e. what will happen with a small array, then a 2d and so on... sometimes this reveals the approach.\n3. Data structure questions are usually about time complexity, so usually... loops in loops in loops is not the correct approach or there's some trick. E.g binary search, merge sort, tracking the max/min while you are populating a data structure, rather than doubling it up, and so on. Try to avoid unnecessary multiple passes.\n\nPractice common patterns and hope you get a problem you can already solve.

For both of mine, I had been doing tons of ML stuff and looking to go back to school for Mathematics so, I had a lot of math in my head. When I read the problem statements I saw mathematical combinatorial problem statements and thought about permutation matrices and k/n choices etc. it was totally wrong. It was a freaking compilers question and they just wanted a stack, push, pop, count the paren depths. Like, WTF how did going into a study domain that I thought would give more leet cred derail me so much. It was a wake up call. I realized, I should have read the question more carefully - dont try to match it to my problem spaces but, find the questions intrinsic problem space. That was mistake one. I would have gotten in they said but, I missed the first two text book points in dp algos and went straight for the third, to do the calculation and then the recursion but, for them it looked like I was trying to write a while(1) forever loop and just never exit the recursion since I never established the stopping conditions - those were so easy I thought it was implied but, since I didnt have them, they were like \"he doenst even know how to write a recursive function\". Those were the mistakes on my side. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey made a couple on their side. First, they originally passed me on my submissions (not passed over - passed as in \"good job\") and scheduled the next interview. Even still I wasnt happy that I didnt nail it so, I re-did it over night and re-submitted. They commented that thats not accepted but, I was still on for interview #2. 20 minutes prior to #2 - they called and said your solution failed to meet x, y, and z. In my mind it was like, \"of course you knew that --- clearly you were keeping me on the hook in case no one better came along\".  Then they commented on my first solution that I do not know \"Sequences\" and I thought - what the hell is a sequence, I have never heard this term in DSA - sure enough, I poured through all my CS books and, the term comes up in only one place: The execution sequence of the code by the CPU/StackPTR/Program-Counter --- THAT, GOOGLE, I AM SORRY, \\*\\*IS\\*\\* the definition of a sequence. I asked the Mgr, please take 3/5/10 minutes and explain verbally on the phone what you mean - what was the concept I was supposed to know and what is the correct solution. \"Yes, we will try to get him for you\" after the third time I asked as a response to their response I gave up, I never heard anything about sequences. I can send you the problems if you want. But, overall, it left me with a taste that - they are playing this holier then thou game and, it is making them arrogant and weak as a result. They do not know the things that they think they do and they are looking for an incredibly specific response which just teaches us to trade notes with each other but, we do it as well on the Wrongful Termination suites which, as an entrepreneur and startup founder, that is what I fear more then anything and I know that they do as well. So, they are just producing a play book through this view of commoditization of skill that carries only bad things for them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck, DM me if you want to go over specifics or just want help/coaching pre-interview. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCheers,  \n\n\nBrian Abbott",

It's equally if not more important to ask questions that show understanding and talk through your thought process out loud. \n\nFor example, take this question: https://youtube.com/shorts/y4hQsaalCT8?si=zASHK-wc2fTSTyKR\n\nThis is a decent entry-level question, take a stab at it if you'd like. The solution presented in the video is great and all, but if I was asking the question, I would only give a very high review if the first things out the person's mouth were questions like:\n\n- Can I assume the array will always be sorted ascending? \n\n- Can there be duplicates numbers in the \"nums\" array? \n\n- Will it be important that this solution can scale to an arbitrary number of summands? (To explain, most interview questions have one base question plus 2 or 3 follow-ups. An obvious follow-up for this question is \"Now how would you change your code if we wanted three summands rather than two? If you write your code in a way that scales well, this might be as easy as just swapping out the number 2 for 3 in one spot in the code. If you don't - like the solution in the video - you might end up rewriting from scratch.) \n\nBy the way, the awareness to ask questions like this would be worth so much more to me than if you know the time complexity for your solution. \n\nSource: am a FAANG SWE, have conducted interviews.",

This includes trees, backtracking, dynamic programming, graphs, and even some greedy algos. You probably won't be able to solve most of the problems involving DFS in that amount of time, but having the base knowledge might be helpful."

This thing will depress you if you aren't careful. The other day, I saw a post where people were posting how many interviews, oa's, offers, and internships they'd had. I participated in it. Then I thought about it: ***who cares?*** \n\nWe're not in the same markets, we don't have the same technical aptitude, we don't have the same people skills, some people blank during tests, some don't. Some people hate interviews, some love them. It's an abject waste of time to compare oneself to others and furthermore, the mind tends to attach to the worst case scenario most times. So instead of instilling confidence, it's insanely easy to see someone's hyperbolic bullshit as a sign of things to come. \"*if all these people have submitted hundreds of apps and gotten no callbacks, how will I ever get one?!\"*\n\nWhen in reality, those people probably just got on indeed and spammed a bunch of places with resumes that they weren't qualified for or didn't have the technical skills to pass OA's for. \n\nIt's just absolutely fruitless. I assume that if someone has applied to 647 internships and gotten **NO** calls or has passed **NO** OA's and gotten **NO** internship offers, there's a reason why and it doesn't have shit to do with me.\n\nThen, when you celebrate accomplishments, people hate on that or spam you asking how you got hired or got interviews or whatever. Dude, I applied, they got back to me. Idk why, I didn't review my own application. \n\n Isn't the whole point of being here **TO SHARE AND HELP EACH OTHER OUT?** If I can't celebrate a win on here the same way I can bitch about a loss, what good does it do?\n\n**DON'T FALL PREY TO ALL THE PESSIMISM HERE!
