(Invoking the fear or as my data bros call it, the \"Warm neck moment\" where you feel the burning on the back of your neck while \"the fear\" sinks in)\n\nD-SQL with @Date Param in Stored Procs... have a plan guide or kiss good bye to your memory. As D-SQL writes new plans and will fill up your plan cache and, as a result, overwrite your database optimising processes and indexing tasks.\n\nStored Proc Deadlocking - SP_BlitzCache and SP_BlitzWho is your friend, also learning how to handle queues for locking issues.\n\nAdmin vs. users do not give everyone DBO access . That's a paddling. I have seen it. Don't do it.  DBO is a database owner. If you grant the front end this level of access, you open your UI to SQL injection attacks.\n\nAlways be paranoid about transactions, ensure you close them, have you closed it, IDK check 3 times if you leave one open with no declared close, you may force a deadlock Begin always write end JIC\n\nSpeaking of transactions always use them, being able to roll back an accidentally dropped production table is relieving.\n\nFinally and arguably, most importantly, if you ever see (With NoLock) in any of your databases, core queries look for a new job. \nIt's too far gone. There is no salvaging this without a serious backend overhaul.\n\nCase in point, With NoLock = Read Uncommitted, which means that the Data read is in a super state like Schrodingers Cat.\n\nIf Bob from HR changes Sally Jane to Sally Smith at the same time, someone else is trying to read the table (with Nolock)...\n\nSally Jane  exists in a committed state, but so does Sally Smi in an uncommitted state, and you get both so you have a phantom in your results... what do they call this ghost read well somewhat unironically... a... ghost read...  If that is part of a stored Proc to update a table, you just got yourself duplicated ID corruption as a feature! \n\nThat's right, they did this accidentally on purpose. The reason they did this was because Concurrency locking was increasing latency for the User, so instead of partitioning locking or heaven forbid adding a queuing task with a loading bar, they thought (with NoLock) has no locks and used that instead... *(even though it does get a schema lock, which means... It will deadlock a server when activated concurrently clashing with itself in a stored proc)* and also it reads via a dirty read, which means, roll your D100 folks and see if the data god Primus is about to corrupt your tables.\n\nIf by now you are feeling like maybe you are a little under prepared or out of your depth, remember plausible deniability means diddly squat to a business who pays you for the sole purpose of knowing this sort of thing and it's easier to just move on and leave someone else more knowledagble to clean up your mess for 5x the salary as a consultant. \n\nHappy trails, my guy.",

Once you get to 32F, that\u2019s exactly when you see an actual visible result (ice cube melting). But this doesn\u2019t mean that you have made no progress from 25F to 31F. Each degree increment has equal weight and part in the ice melting, it isn\u2019t the 31F to 32F that did it. You had to go through that process to get to 32F. 26F\u2026 27F\u2026 28F\u2026 up until 31F before the melting starts.\n\nWhat the author is trying to say is that your progress is not meaningless.

            "@OP: This will be a long one, but please read it all. It might be helpful and inspire you.\n\nPlease don't let yourself feel down. This economy is very very bad and nobody wants to acknowledge it. We are living in an economic crisis worse than '08 if you recall it. I have applied to almost 400 jobs and did like 8 interviews. I just got an offer last week (after being unemployed for 4 months). Note that I am a junior software engineer...not an entry-level one!\n\nForget about others' expectations (hard to do but is a must to remain sane through these tough times) and focus on your own timeline. In other times, you would have found a job way earlier. What I'm trying to say is that you have NOT failed...the economy failed YOU - and all of us!\n\nFrom what you say, if you can actually afford being unemployed at the moment (i.e. not having to go do Uber Eats or a classic retail job to survive) then invest most of your time in working on projects that are real life applications (not sure if you already have projects like that).\n\nDisregard all your family's negative comments or toxic expectations. Getting married while working a moot corporate job is not the definition of success. Getting married while you are in control of where you work and what you work on is way more representative of a successful individual.\n\nWhat I mean is find a few small businesses in your area (that already use some tech in their operations) and develop an application that could make their operations easier (completely for free). For example: find a barber and create a simple reservation app for them, or find a local pet care and create a simple CRM for them. In all cases, something that real-life users will be using.\n\nThis shows prospective employers that you can actually solve real-life problems and can communicate with users as well. Repeat this for another business or two. You would still be applying for job posts while you do that. You need to update your resume/portfolio as if you finished the applications - you wouldn't be lying if it comes up...but stop with the leetcodes (real life does not revolve around leetcode problems..they could be helpful but not core requirements).\n\nIf after you are done, and still have no improvement/conversion from job applications, then you can continue being a freelancer if you must or simply create apps and sell them.\n\nMore specifically, those retail jobs are only refusing to hire you because you are way overqualified for the jobs...yes that's a thing! They also are bootstrapping financially and don't want to hire you if you will quit soon. It doesn't mean you cannot do the job.\n\nI wish you the best of luck, OP, you got this!",

Totally irrelevant to what you studied. It is so mentally draining with 5-6 rounds for each application (even shit companies are asking for leetcode, system design and everyone got 6 rounds lol) just for companies to reject you in the end. System design and leetcode hards being thrown in your face, expecting to be solved within 20 mins is just madness now.",

Consider additional training or certifications: Look into online courses or certifications that can enhance your skills and make you stand out to potential employers.\nRemember to take care of your mental health during this challenging time.

Break down your personal projects and past experience in detail in your experience portion of your resume, and be sure you\u2019re checking your resume for ATS compliance and notable keywords with the job posting.

That's not realistic at all, if you're doing any work at all actually making a good application.\n\nSo yeah, of course it takes that many. Next time, don't spam them like that?

Let's just assume 1200 applications, 10 minutes spent on each (which is extremely short) and 4 months of applying - that's almost 2h each and every day for 4 months straight! And this does not even include researching the position. I also doubt that 10 minutes would be enough to tailor your application for the position.\n\nAs someone receiving quite a lot of applications, I'd recommend to spend more time on each one and prioritise quality over quantity.
