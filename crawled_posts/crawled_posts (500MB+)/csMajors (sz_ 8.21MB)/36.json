I\u2019ve been at a few jobs now( 2 internships and 2 jobs) of very different sizes and never had one in an interview.

Their largest predators are tech monopolies. Politicians are scared of consolidation, they can smell the privacy issues and the amount of power private entities have. \n\nWhen interest rates get higher tech giants get reduced margins. They promised their shareholders growth and are liable to deliver that growth. So the tech companies decide to cut cost.

There\u2019s so much mystique around Tesla these days. Around Elon Musk. And let me tell you, he doesn\u2019t have time for any of that in person. He\u2019s a busy man, and an important one.\n\nThe competition for one of his internships is one of the toughest in today\u2019s job market, and that\u2019s saying something. I was doing technical interviews over the phone for weeks. One day, an interviewer called in the morning and grilled me for so long that I just straight up skipped one of my classes!\n\nSacrifices. Elon appreciates those.\n\nAt long last I made it to the final round. It\u2019s true what they say-- he interviews everybody who will ever work for him. They flew me out to the Fremont factory in California, and my hands started shaking as soon as I stepped into the building.\n\nI was led into a conference room. And there he was. Elon Musk, in the flesh.\n\nWe exchanged pleasantries. Our tone was light, but Elon\u2019s eyes never left mine. I could tell what he was doing. He was sizing me up. Testing the waters. Seeing if I would crack under the pressure.\n\nEver so slowly, we meandered closer to actual interview territory. \u201cSo your resume mentions app development. Tell me about that.\u201d\n\nI had to stop a smile from breaking out onto my face. Oh, wow, Elon Musk read my resume!\n\n\u201cSo I, uh, had to spend a little time getting used to Swift, but--\u201d\n\nElon cut me off. \u201cYou an iOS fan?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. Yes, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere. Gimme a sec.\u201d Elon disappeared from the conference room.\n\nI let out a shaky breath and collapsed into my chair. Was I doing great? Poorly? Incredibly poorly? I\u2019d heard the stories. Engineers fired after screaming rages, careers snuffed out in seconds. Oh, god, he wasn\u2019t coming back with security, was he? He was only gone for a couple of minutes, but it felt like hours.\n\nThe door crashed open. I sat back up, ramrod straight. Here came Elon, and there was something in his hands. It was a jet-black container, shiny and spherical. Except that it wasn\u2019t a sphere, exactly. There was a dent near the top, and it flared inwards towards the bottom. What did that remind me of...?\n\nElon unscrewed the top and gently tapped some of the container\u2019s contents onto the table. A whitish dust spilled out. He took his credit card out of his wallet and started chopping the pile into lines.\n\nMy eyes bugged out of my head. Elon glanced up.\n\n\u201cOh, no, don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not coke. Take a look! You don\u2019t have to worry.\u201d\n\nHe slid the open container over to me and got back to his work. I picked it up. The stuff inside was a light gray, so he was right. It probably wasn\u2019t coke. But what the hell was it?\n\nI heard a guttural snort, and I almost dropped the container before setting it down. Elon reared up from his desk with fire in his eyes. \u201cWoah! Still kicks.\u201d\n\nHe had a rolled-up dollar bill in one hand, and he shoved it into my face. \u201cYour turn.\u201d\n\n\u201cHang on. What...what\u2019s happening? What is this?\u201d\n\nElon looked at me like I was an idiot. \u201cWhat do you think it is? Guess. I went and got this because you mentioned iOS. I want you to guess.\u201d\n\nThen it hit me. That container. It wasn\u2019t just a sphere, and it wasn\u2019t just an apple.\n\nIt was an apple-shaped urn.\n\n\u201cOh my God, are you snorting Steve Jobs\u2019 ashes?\u201d\nElon did another line and clapped his hands. \u201cFantastic, man! Not a lot of people even know he was cremated. I knew I had a good feeling about you.\u201d\n\nThis was a prank. It had to be. This all had to be one big, bizarre test, so I figured I would play along. \u201cSecurity wasn\u2019t that tight around his grave, huh?\u201d\n\n\u201cNope,\u201d said Elon, too calmly. \u201cSecurity at Alta Mesa\u2019s a joke. Couple of months ago I just stayed until midnight, dug them out myself.\u201d\n\nElon dipped a finger into the jar and rubbed his gums. \u201cYou know I met him once? Steve. He was such an asshole. He hated me. My companies. Well, look who\u2019s laughing now.\u201d He smiled at me, then coughed. A grey, powdery cloud billowed into the air. I tried not to breathe.\n\n\u201cSteve\u2019s grave was unmarked,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut that wasn\u2019t a problem. I could smell him.\u201d\n\nElon\u2019s eyes started to unfocus. \u201cI could smell the animus that drove his soul. The energy. And, soon, it will be mine.\u201d\n\nNobody spoke for a while.\n\n\u201cIt will all be mine,\u201d whispered Elon, and it was like I wasn\u2019t even in the room.\n\nHe blinked. \u201cAnyways. You want a hit?\u201d\n\nFor the first time in what felt like forever I felt like I was allowed to speak. \u201c...No, man, I\u2019m good.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no way I can do this. I fought back the urge to gag. That\u2019s a human being floating in the air right now. There have to be laws against that kind of thing, right? And even if there weren\u2019t, this feels so deeply, deeply wrong. I might have to talk to the authorities after this. After all, I still have my character, my convictions--\n\n\u201cListen.\u201d Elon clapped a hand on my shoulder. \u201cOne little bump, and you\u2019re walking out that door with a job.\u201d\n\nAnyways, I start next quarter.",
