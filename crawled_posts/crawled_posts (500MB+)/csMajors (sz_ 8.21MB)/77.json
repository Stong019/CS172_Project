There's a deeper cause that's often overlooked, especially by younger devs who are being hit hard by the downturn.\n\nI'm writing this because I see too many people pointing fingers at \"Day in the Life\" videos for market saturation. **That's not the issue.** These videos have existed for years. If they were the problem, the industry would have tanked long ago.\n\nOther common scapegoats include bootcamps and AI advancements. I don't claim to be an expert in AI, so I can't make broad claims about whether or not AI will take our jobs in the future. But I can confidently say this: GPT-4 is not ready to run production-ready software. As for bootcamps, I believe they fill an important niche. Not every dev making CRUD apis or buttons in React needs to know what a Red-Black tree is. At my last job, my team's Staff engineer was a self-taught university dropout. Tech values skills over credentials, and fetishizing degrees won't take us anywhere good.\n\nSo, what's the real cause of the downturn? I'd like to propose that it's *interest rates*. High interest rates are driven by inflation, a direct consequence of excessive money printing. The money printed during the pandemic hasn't been distributed fairly. Since 2020, the world's 10 richest men have doubled their net worths, while average people see their purchasing power shrink due to inflation. When borrowing is expensive, companies naturally cut back on spending \u2013 including R&D budgets that support engineering jobs. And with each layoff, stocks shoot up and investors get richer and richer. The system is rigged against us right now, and there's not much we can do about it.\n\nYoung devs are understandably angry at the world because the market isn't providing them a path to a decent living. This systemic failure absolutely justifies their anger. I urge those devs to direct that anger towards those truly in power, not fellow devs. People in tech for the money aren't the enemy; they're trying to provide for themselves and their families.\n\n&#x200B;",

And now they\u2019re hiring at maybe 75% of the rate they should be. The convergence will happen but it won\u2019t be the return to madness many people expect.",

            "Unfortunately OP's take might sound better than the TikTok bashing but is also not 100% correct.\n\nCompanies that build things that make money are still hiring - the rise in interest rates has caused all the unprofitable or risky projects to be scrapped, because borrowing money for free to finance the possible next big thing isn\u2019t free anymore. Low interest rates have not incentivized companies to do due diligence or market analysis, instead they were incentivized to churn out software and features that no one might need.\n\nDon\u2019t let yourself get discouraged, there are still jobs out there that hire - competition is stiff and you might not work on the latest tech, but that was always the case, even in the past.",

Interest rates 100% contributed meaningfully to the layoffs, anyone who disagrees is ignorant, willful or not. It's not as black and white as supply and demand of labor. It's also how easy it is to make money or increase shareholder value.\n\nMy observation is that expectations were also likely skewed. People posting the \"life-in-a-day\" videos are usually something FAANG or of that tier. This was very competitive to get into to begin with, even when money was free. That said it's easy to feel scammed, the reality is the industry is trimming fat because share price comes first, and not all initiatives are profitable, even if they're interesting or have social utility. Higher interest rate directly and significantly penalize tech stocks.\n\nSince this is csMajors, I would say the \"programming\" skill set is here to stay, but don't get sold a dream. Most don't graduate and fall into 400k pay+stock TC right out of uni. Those who do are a mix of both extremely skilled and lucky. 99% of people aren't that. That said, massive pay packages are still out there if one has the leverage to demand it (this is kinda stupid to say because it's nearly always true, in all industries).\n\nAnecdotally, looking at peers who made it through the multiple rounds of layoffs, they're all super strong engineers but also incredibly hard working, constantly upskill, and sociable.",

            "> \"Got a CS degree august 2022 and can't land a job.\"\n\nSounds like you're in a tough fucking spot. But let's be real, a degree doesn't guarantee a job. The world's a competitive shithole. Are you considering how you're differentiating yourself from the horde of other CS grads?\n\n> \"l've been doing the odin project...\"\n\nGood on you for learning more shit on your own. But how are you showcasing this to potential employers? Are you just listing these skills, or do you have kickass projects that scream, \"Look, I'm a damn coding wizard\"?\n\n> \"I've applied to many places through linked in...\"\n\nFuck, applying en masse is like throwing shit at the wall and hoping something sticks. Are you tailoring your applications? Each job's unique, and if your resume looks generic, it's going in the trash.\n\n> \"l've tried applying to QA Engineer roles...\"\n\nNot getting a QA job doesn\u2019t mean you're fucked. Maybe it's not about the role but how you're selling your skills. Are you making it clear how your coding experience translates into potential success in QA?\n\n> \"I've tried to just learn more skills and update my resumes...\"\n\nLearning new skills is great, but how are you weaving these into a narrative that makes you look like a fucking catch for any employer?\n\n> \"I'm losing hope on life and confused as to what school was even for.\"\n\nSchool gives you a foundation, not a red carpet to a job. It's a bitch, but have you thought about what value you can offer beyond academic credentials?\n\n> \"I've applied to a DoD company...\"\n\nFizzbuzz is basic shit. If you're acing that and still not landing jobs, maybe it's not your technical skills that are the problem. Ever considered that it could be something else, like your interview technique or how you come across personally?\n\n> \"I\u2019ll try. You\u2019re making it sound like those jobs are guaranteed though.\"\n\nNo job's a fucking guarantee. You're facing the harsh reality of job hunting. It's brutal and often unfair. What are you doing to stand out and not just be another face in the crowd?\n\n> \"My network isn\u2019t too big and my skills are too basic perhaps.\"\n\nNetworking is key. It's not just what you know, but who. How are you working on expanding your network? Remember, it's a two-way street; you need to offer value too.\n\n> \"Im a first generation college student.\"\n\nThat's tough, but it's also a unique story. How can you use this to your advantage, to show resilience and self-motivation?\n\n> \"Ive had interviews but no offers.\"\n\nYou're getting interviews; that's a start. But why no offers? What\u2019s going wrong? Is there a pattern in the feedback you're getting, or are you not asking for feedback at all?\n\nFace the shitstorm head-on.

Try to get users on these sites. List these sites on your resume.\n\nAnother option you could add on to is: Go back to grad school with the intention of doing more internships and networking.\n\n  \nTake my advice with a grain of salt.

I found job postings on LinkedIn, then would go to the company site and find the posting in their careers page and apply there.

Any extra effort you can put in can help. \n\nMake projects that show you are passionate about coding.

I noticed that when looking at job listing, a lot of them were looking for c# developers, as well as other languages that I didn't know.

I also kind of had to humble myself and realize that I wasn't very good at c++ at all. Both of those things together led to me sitting down and actually trying hard to learn a new language, which was c#. And that worked. I followed a couple of tutorials online that centered around easy portfolio building apps, and I also wrote and hosted my own website. All this to say, what was helpful to me was looking at the job market in a more analytical and transactional way. I wasn't getting hired because the tools I offered to an employer weren't desirable. Also, please don't take away that you should learn c#. I think you should look at postings and see what languages commonly pop-up and try to learn those. It just happened to be c# in the listings that I was seeing at the time.",

Just practice a ton of LeetCode problems on whatever language you feel comfortable and you should do okay.",

            "I am surprised no one has mentioned this but in addition to your resume, you also need to send in a cover letter. The resume only lists your skillset but a cover letter will describe how your skills will be utilized based on the job description.\n\nYou can do all the portfolios about all the projects you have done and list them but a cover letter is a conversation to the recruiter as to how useful you can be. Just sending a cover letter will put you miles ahead of others who are submitting resumes the same as you.\n\nAnother thing is personality. You have to hide your desperation in the interview. If I were to interview and if I just get a hint that you are desperate for the job, that will just put me off. You have to fake it till you make it. Answer only what you are asked. Make light joke, small talk, pepper your descriptions with personal anecdotes if you will. Interpersonal skills are mandatory. If you have sheltered yourself in the past four years with little human interaction, or you don't know how to carry yourself among strange people and have conversations, you will need to learn this so you don't give a \"creepy, depressed, anxious\" vibe in your interviews.",
