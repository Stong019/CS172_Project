            "I have plenty of CS new grad friends who are landing internships and jobs left and right in the past two years, some FAANG and some non-FAANG. None of them are from top tier schools either. I have seen them working their butts off polishing their resumes, networking constantly, and practicing coding interviews. \n\nFrom what I have seen, the ones from the same schools that aren't getting gigs are missing one of those three. For example, a friend (CS grad) of a close friend of mine reached out about working at my startup (good networking), but his resume was just horrendous - a whole page of text that didn't tell me anything about his capabilities, limits, or achievements. I interviewed him anyway as a courtesy and had to ask a bunch of questions to extract that out of him - oh you put a huge list of skills with crazy number of JS frameworks, but you really only have experience with designing and coding front-end stuff, etc. I would suggest [https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringResumes](https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringResumes/) as a first stop on this, their wiki is really helpful in structuring your resume and writing down USEFUL information.\n\nAnother thing I have seen are people who just keep sending resumes into the void that is the ATS. I made this mistake throughout my career as well. When I was starting out, I was seeing my friends getting internships at FAANG but I couldn't get anything, so I asked one of them how they got it. They told me that they actually looked up recruiters recruiting for those companies on LinkedIn, and send a connect request with message. They did this a bunch of times over the span of a few months to get SOME recruiters' attention. I don't suggest you log into LinkedIn right now and just spam recruiters though, that won't get you far. As a starting point, many recruiters for FAANG and other large companies make posts about jobs regularly on LinkedIn, some even compile a list of different companies as well, you can start following them and slowly build the relationship and go from there. Recruiters are your friend.\n\nLastly, stop blaming the bootcamp folks, you're not going to get very far in life with that mentality. I have worked with quite a few very passionate people trained by bootcamps who are very good problem solvers and did quite well, it was just that they were just from very disadvantaged backgrounds. The get-rich-quick-scheming folks aren't limited to those coming out of bootcamps, and I think the bootcampers actually have a bigger uphill battle in this arena as well since through traditional schooling, you get a lot more opportunities with internships and research opportunities and whatnot, which makes it much easier to prove yourself.",
