        "selftext": "After a long five and a half years of CS at the University of Utah I've finally graduated with an offer from my dream company. During those years in college I saw constant pressure to practice online coding challenges and to get an internship at Google, Microsoft, etc, but truthfully I dislike the sound of either of those, I wanted to go into healthcare\n\nBy my third year I still didn't have any internships and had probably a 3.3 GPA, so without much direction I just started applying to as many internships as I could. I applied while in class, I applied during my lunch breaks, I applied at every moment I could find time. By the time I got an internship I racked up almost 230 applications (less than 5 had cover letters and I had no personal connections to any companies I applied to). This is what those applications resulted in\n\n* Number of Internships Applied to: 227\n   * Rejections: 136\n   * Did not hear back: 68\n   * First Round Interviews before accepting first internship: 19\n      * ADM, UPMC (x2), State Farm (x2), TIAA, Southwest Airlines, Principal, CarMax, Prudential, Amazon, Bank of America, HCA, Mayo Clinic (x2), Tenet, Centene, Qurate\n   * Second Round Interviews before accepting first internship: 5\n      * Prudential, Southwest Airlines, UPMC, Mayo Clinic (x2)\n      * Second Round interview that came after I accepted first internship: 1\n   * Made first round interview but didn't want to interview for: 4\n      * ADM, Principal, HCA, Statefarm\n   * First Round Interviews after accepting first internship: 11\n      * Centene, Qurate, Principal (x2), Statefarm, Nordstrom, NextEra Energy, Verizon (x2), Stryker (x2)\n\nWhy I think this strategy works: Assuming all CS students are good candidates to a certain percentage of internships, if you just keep applying to internships the numbers will work themselves out eventually. What did I have going in my favor? Disregarding a very average 3.3 GPA, I was a unique candidate. I was the captain of the jump section of my track team and was pretty personable in interviews. I also had a  web scraping project to my name that was complete minimum viable product.\n\nMy biggest tips:\n\n* Get an internship even if it isn't your \"dream internship\" during your sophomore summer or junior summer if you plan on going for a senior summer internship\n   * This is going to really give you some leverage for the next internship application cycle\n   * If you happen to not get your dream internship the next year then you have a good backup spot and some leverage for when you apply to real jobs\n   * This will give you some pay leverage whether at internships or jobs\n* Focus heavily on being personable\n   * I can't tell you the difference it made that the manager hiring and I felt like we had a good connection. These people are going to be spending a decent amount of time with you, so they'd prefer to enjoy that time even if you're not the most \"prestigious\" application\n* You can really stand out with unique qualifications\n   * By the time I graduated I spent over a year as the president of track and field at my school\n* Start early (September/October)\n   * I have a suspicion that many internships don't get as much attention in the first week or two postings have been up if they're really early in internship season\n\nI used this strategy again the next year and now have a total of over 500 applications submitted, although it's easier the second time when you have an internship on your resume. Hopefully this will inspire people to stop taking leet/coding challenges so seriously and to focus more on diversifying their skill sets!",

            "\nEdit: This is not a defense of the actual losers on the post. Not even a defense of the people who say NoT AlL mEn. Just my opinion about how the way we talk about these things leads to such defensiveness. \n\nI think we can all agree that 9/10 times it is a man and at the same time not blame men as a whole for the behavior. \n\nThe reason people have a strong reaction when people speak in generalizations is because no one wants to be lumped in with a negative group. It\u2019s very easy to slip into sexism and racism and all the ism\u2019s when you refer to a whole group of people by a negative trait.\n\nSo what is your argument? The \u201cgood ones\u201d should know it\u2019s not about them and they don\u2019t need to say validate themselves? Sure maybe some people can do that. I know when people say men do x and y they\u2019re probably not talking about me because I\u2019ve never done x and y. At the same time, it still rubs me the wrong way because I\u2019m a man and you are in fact referring to me when you say \u201cmen\u201d regardless of how you add caveats. \n\nIt\u2019s correlation and causation. Terminally online men exhibit these behaviors, typically ones who have fallen into redpill spaces, not men. Men are correlated with the behavior, but it\u2019s not because they\u2019re a man. Being a man is a common trait of people who exhibit the behavior, but it\u2019s not BECAUSE they are a man.\n\nI completely understand why people get angry if you refer to men as the problem, and at the same time I agree we need to solve the problem and that the problem is almost always with a man. These things can all coexist.",

Therefore when that expectation is shattered or challenged, you have doom and gloom posts. People going into Physics don't an expectation tp a similar extent.\n\n- The ratio of people going into CS because of money vs because of passion is probably way higher than for Physics majors.\n\n\nEdit: A possible third reason is the grueling journey of job hunting as of late. Namely, I doubt many other majors typically submit hundreds of applications on top of interview prep on top of preparing their portfolio via projects outside of school. But competition and saturation make that an uncommon experience. Sure the alternative for many other fields is extra like 2+ years of school, or a job that typically pays way less with less potential for career growth, but constant rejections due to this game which is also luck-based and numbers-based is demoralizing.",

        "selftext": "A lot of people out here get discouraged when they come across a algorithm problem they can't solve, so I just wanted to provide a perspective. \n\nI interned at Google/FB and a top unicorn. Had a phone interview today and I bombed it. Question wasn't even that hard in hindsight, I got a bit flustered and wrote code that didn't make sense and was full of bugs as interviewer pointed them out. \n\nThese interviews don't get easier just because someone has interned at top tech companies. It's still a b\\*\\*\\*\\*. I often still mess up on simple problems and question whether I'm a good programmer/engineer. Point is, it's ok to fail and to be discouraged - it happens to everyone but don't for a second think that you are somehow lesser of a CS student than your friends who have shiny internships. A career in tech really is a long journey and this is just the beginning for all of us. \"making it\" does not mean finally getting a FAANG offer, trust me.",

            "I had an internship at Google. I was about to finish my masters degree and I had JUST gotten the highest grade in graduate level graph algorithms. Facebook came to campus and was conducting in person phone interviews per se. I go in and the guy gives an intro and goes \"suppose I have a tree structure and I want to print out the different levels, how would I do that?\" \n\n\nI respond \"I would do BFS!\"\n\nHe goes \"YUUUUUUP! Can you code it?\"\n\nI go \"YUUUUP\". And then I proceed to completely bomb it. I freeze. I completely forgot that BFS uses a queue, so I was trying to do for loops. I was beyond embarrassed. I capped my pen, apologized, and walked out. \n\nIt was a good lesson that being good at school doesn't directly correlate to interviewing. Of course, I then went on to bomb interviews at any company I could think of. I eventually passed an interview for a small startup that lost money after 4 months. I then got a job at a really good start up which got purchased by big N and everything is swell now.",

            "Posts that ground our expectations are much welcome and do a lot to help prevent a toxic expectation of greatness.",
            "What is Unicorn?",
            "Thank you! I was feeling like I\u2019m so stupid. This helps a lot.",
            "These technical interviews are such bullshit. \n\nThere is no correlation between being able to write good code and knowing algorithms. You learn as you go.\n\nWhat makes a good programmer is the ability to write code that is correct, self explanatory, and well documented all at the same time. \n\nShit is ridiculous. Fuck FAANG I would never be a code monkey for these evil fucking companies that track their users and create the content that is causing the destruction of society. Creating the mind control tools.",

            "At least you have faang experience so you are going somewhere. I am not even landing a single internship and sometimes it really makes me think if I will ever get a swe job.",
            "I needed to hear this. This isn't a Sprint... It is a marathon",
            "Glad to hear it\u2019s the same for all of us haha \ud83d\ude02",
            "This problem vanishes with practice. Leetcoding under pressure is a separate skill from being a good worker. Totally reasonable to stumble on the real deal. Just gotta grind out mock interviews the week before so it\u2019s muscle memory.",

            "It might not be super helpful, but your perception could be fucked and you're interviewing better than you think? I landed a great job post grad and I 100% thought I was a dipshit and would get ghosted. Idk man, it depends on how well everyone else interviews/the reqs of the position.",
