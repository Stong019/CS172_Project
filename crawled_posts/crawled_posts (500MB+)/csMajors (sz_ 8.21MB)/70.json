I was so down in the trenches in the beginning of the year that i couldn't even do binary search questions on leetcode. But i took it 1 step at a time. I did a problem a day on leetcode. Then 2 and 3. Then i did a problem on project euler a day. Then 2 and 3. I don't wanna ramble but if theres one thing id say is that quote from Bojack Horseman: it gets easier. Every day it gets a little easier. But you gotta do it every day, that's the hard part. But it does get easier.",

Automating business stuff. But the interview was minimally technical. No LC questions. Just silly HR type questions and discussion of my resume projects. Am I just one lucky asshole? Or is everyone posting just a tad hyper-focused on FAANG/big-N?\n\nNo hate fr, I\u2019m out here applying to higher paying stuff and getting rejected too. Solidarity.

My advice would be to fix your resume( I assume you already have gone through this 100x), and start building something actually useful in the meantime while applying to places. Don\u2019t lose in touch with your coding skills. Try to learn something off of Udemy or something and start building a full application you can show. You\u2019ll learn a lot and eventually you\u2019ll get an interview and if you can build a whole app from scratch your leagues ahead most new grads who can do basic stuff they did in classes only.

Initially they wanted me to be a doctor but they changed their minds. This was their logic:\n\n1. You will be spending upwards of 8-10 years in preparation to be a doctor, at which point you\u2019ll be making good-ish money. If you work in CS you could be making good money from the get-go, and then crazy money by the time you would have otherwise been just finishing residency. The idea that Med or Law is the Good Guaranteed Way\u2122\ufe0f is an old way of thinking.\n\n2. If you become a doctor you will have constant demand but a cap on what you can do with it. You\u2019ll be a specialist in your field but that\u2019s it. If you\u2019re in CS you can branch in ways that would make Git blush. You have the opportunity to research, hybridize with other fields, or even start your own tech company. Or you could be on the ground floor for a new startup. With Medicine the best you could do is go into Business and try to move up or start your own practice.\n\n3. Big companies might be slowing hiring but if I threw a rock into a crowd of onlookers I\u2019ll hit some startup person in the face. You may not have that kind of \u201cI have a medical license I can go where I want\u201d security but everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, needs CS people. Tech is the lifeblood of modern industry. \n\n4. I think that, especially now, your dad is overestimating the kind of \u201cprestige\u201d that medicine has. I love doctors and their work is important and grueling and often times has a big mental toll, but unless you\u2019re some kinda brain surgeon or you invented some incredible new treatment you\u2019re just another doctor at another nameless hospital... doing the same things that every other doctor does. \n\nTech is life now. The next recession or economic dive isn\u2019t going to be the great depression or some huge post apocalyptic luddite movement where we fucking abandon all our computers suddenly and twist motherboards into speartips.

Nobody tells stories about the safe decisions they made in their life.\n\nFor me, CS is an art school.  We create things and have insights into the world that others never really see.  He sends you screenshots from a computer, encoded by a computer, over computer mediated radio waves, to you who is far away.  He probably has no idea how that works or how many people like us were involved in every step of that simple ( to him ) operation.  It is done so well that he just expects it to work.\n\nMedicine is a body mechanic.  Besides empathy and some diagnostics, it can be ( and will be ) replaced by machines.  Empathy, as a career, can take a brutal toll on one's soul.  Old doctors and nurses are so often sour, scared and bitter people who have seen so much of the worst in people.  The prestige is an old world, last generation kind of thing.  Young doctors often look to us with envy and the trappings of being called Dr are fading.\n\nWhereas art and creation lift us up.  As CS people, we are literally creating worlds that connect people in ways that humans have never been connected before.  We automate away the tedium using ingenuity, insight and passion in high speed teams of interconnected humans.  We rarely solve the same problem twice.  Or alone.\n\nIt's a much better life choice in my mind and 25y later, I'm still very happy to have chosen CS over medicine or law.",

Sure, he'll have better earning potential once he finishes his residency, but once again he'll likely have to move somewhere else again, potentially somewhere even more expensive to live, and it may well take him a decade or more to pay off that debt before he gets to start enjoying that income.\n\nBy then, my income will be pretty well in-line with what a doctor earns and I will have been saving/investing for many years.
