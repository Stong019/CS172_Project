The % of students and graduates with side projects is very low, and the % that is willing to put them on their resume or discuss them is even lower.\n\nThe mantra here about working on projects to help start or boost your career is very rare.

It\u2019s not useless**, and you will eventually enjoy it once you get enough of an understanding to not be intimidated by it. Theory knowledge will form the basis of your ability to find a job and solve interview problems to prove your knowledge. \n2.\t**You are good enough and smart enough**. You may not know it yet, but you will build your confidence in your abilities and come to see you are much more capable than you think you are.\n3.\tStop wasting so much time on video games and Reddit (both fine in moderation) and trying to save a doomed relationship. Every week dedicate a bit of time, even if it\u2019s just an hour (but ideally a few hours) to working on side projects, an hour or two practicing Leetcode, etc. **Consistent habitual practice will go so much farther than last minute motivation and cramming before an exam or interview..**\n4.\t**Grades do matter, but not in the way you think**.

Who cares if you look like an idiot who knows nothing, most people do at this point. By making yourself be that idiot who is underprepared freshman year, you learn about the process and now you won\u2019t be that idiot sophomore or junior year. \n8.\t**Go to career fairs**. It doesn\u2019t matter that your resume sucks. It doesn\u2019t matter that you aren\u2019t good enough. Get over your shyness and go. This will teach you how to speak like a professional with a recruiter, and you might make a contact at a large company who can help you out. You might become friends with the nice person in like next to you. \n9.\t**Go to hackathons**. No you don\u2019t have to pull an all nighter.

I\u2019ll never be able to go back and have an internship. And I don\u2019t regret it because I missed out on money and clout, I regret it because I missed on friendship and fun / interesting experiences.

            "I'm a post-bacc student who started my CS degree at 32 years old. All of this, to me, seems like obvious no-brainers. \n\nAnd I don't say that to downplay this post - rather, to support it! \n\nAlmost all of the motivated non-traditional students I know (myself included), do all of these things naturally. And I see younger students who are intimated to talk to professors, who wait until the last minute to apply to internships, who isolate themselves from others, who refuse to see the value of theory, etc. Then they come to me and ask how I've managed to get good grades, to have good relationships with professors, to receive opportunities for internship and mentorship, to do well in interviews and get job offers. It's not because I'm smarter or more deserving - much it has to do with being honest and outgoing, simply asking for help and for putting into the world that you have a genuine desire to *learn* and will appreciate support from others (both peers, and superiors). \n\nI'd also like to add to this list: do things that make you happy! Stay motivated, but don't let academics control your life. Don't chase prestige and money exclusively - those things come naturally. Be well-rounded: exercise, pursue hobbies, take extra elective classes that sound interesting just for fun (drawing, music, world history, whatever). It will absolutely make you a better programmer and a better job candidate, and (more importantly) enrich your life and make you happier. I promise you will look back on this time in your life and wish you had capitalized on your youth and not just grinded leetcode obsessively to land a faang job.",

            "As someone who is graduating this semester, 7 and 8 are essential, and my two greatest regrets. Honestly, IMO it is worth taking  a hit to your grades (as long as you still learn the material) to make them happen. I have a FAANG internship this summer, but if I'd worked harder at getting internships in previous years, I'd probably be sliding into a full time position (not necessarily FAANG) instead. Optimizing your resume and practicing basic interview skills + some leetcode is more important that they GPA imo. \n\nAlso, did 9 and 10, highly recommend. Chances are you'll learn lots of useful skills. A club is how I became proficient with git for example.",

And you may get that faang job and realize something else is where you want to be in a few more years.  Enjoy the process where you are and try to avoid the grass is greener syndrome.

            "Yea when I was graduating I asked the other students at the ceremony what projects they had been working on outside of class, and not one of them (of the 10-15 near me) was working on anything.  I couldn\u2019t believe it.  I\u2019m about 10 years into my career, work a job I love (most of the time), and make almost $200k a year.  Can\u2019t complain. \n\nEverything this post is pretty accurate.  I\u2019d also add that you should absolutely try to get a part time job programming during school.  During school you can afford to get paid $10-20 an hour (more easily than you can as an adult with expenses).  My friends made sandwiches, don\u2019t waste your time on that shit.  No one expects a $10/hr programmer to be THAT good (it\u2019s relatively low pressure) and it\u2019s such a different experience than class projects.  I had had 2 software jobs by the time I left school (turned my $10/hr job into a 2nd $20/hr job) and it was pretty easy to turn that into a $60k+ salary.  I was coming from a low-pay state and they actually chuckled when I said I wanted to make over $50k a year (that was my personal goal).  It\u2019s been constant raises and promotions since then. \n\nWhat is super important IMO:\n-\tlearn Linux and especially bash, as much as possible.  Insanely valuable\n-\tget a low paying job to build skills.  Maybe not even needed nowadays since programmers are in such high demand\n-\tSIDE PROJECTS - those got me over the hump and get WAY easier over time as you build more skills\n\nI also read everything on the r/Programming subreddit mostly every day whether I understood it or not.  \n\nThis is a lifelong subject and skill, you just need to put in the time.  That\u2019s far easier when you are young and have energy.  Don\u2019t neglect it!  \u201cSuccess is not mystery, success is the continuous application of the fundamentals\u201d",
