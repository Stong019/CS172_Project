            "One thing that I think is happening right now is the market is in a state of whiplash as it transitions from a period of rapid growth to a more stable era. During the 2022 boom companies lost a lot of talent and were forced to settle for lesser candidates for both internships and experienced positions as hiring became competitive. Now hiring has slowed down, but companies are still full of the bad hires they took on during the boom years and their entry level hiring pipelines are full of interns which they over hired in the 2021-2022 era. Meanwhile companies laying off junior devs or canceling intern offers are leaving candidates stranded as the companies still hiring at the entry level will prefer to hire their own interns rather than recruit new people. Further, layoffs seem to disproportionately effect the more competitive companies, are often not merit based, and affect entire teams or cohorts of interns, leaving many qualified candidates stranded. Non-FAANG companies with mediocre hires and interns picked up in the 2021-2022 era could probably lay off the bottom performing 50% and rehire to better candidates, and this would likely level the playing field at the entry level, but this is just not how the system works. Eventually the job market will likely level itself out as internship programs become more selective and hiring standards adjusts to the current market but until then it sucks for everyone graduating from good schools that are caught in this state of transition.",

            "I highly doubt it's about qualification as others have said. Companies were happy to hire more and less qualified candidates when tech was booming and interest rates were low. Here are my guesses:\n\n1. [Wages are sticky](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sticky-wage-theory.asp#:~:text=Key%20Takeaways,via%20layoffs%2C%20if%20profitability%20falls). They don't fluctuate with market conditions as quickly as commodified goods. Over time maybe it will decrease but maybe tech will boom again and wages will go up instead.\n2. Companies don't want drastically unequal pay from new hires and old hires. New hires will complain and old hires will leave if their pay is cut. I'm no lawyer but it might also open them up for law suits if someone comes up with a discrimination case. It's more important to them that old hires don't leave.\n3.  Big companies just don't have new grad positions that they want to fill. Whether or not they lower wages the number of positions aren't changing. They'd need to make a decision to grow teams. It seems like they're just back filling previously open positions right now.",

In a coding project the more ppl are brought on the worse the marginal gains. In fact the marginal return for a code base is so horrid that you'd oftentimes want fewer programmers on it rather than more.\n\nSo what do big companies want? They want a small elite team of coders, and not an army of cheap labours that'll invariably make things far worse.\n\nIt's really a nature of programming itself, being so precise and brittle and highly idiosyncratic. These properties make it exceedingly difficult for a random joe to contribute in a meaningful way.",

            "Because they want the best and are willing to pay for it.\n\nYou know that idea of the 10x programmer? There's some truth to that.  My company recently started looking at some metrics to evaluate the productivity of data scientists and developers on our team and the difference in productivity between a mediocre data scientist or developer and a highly skilled one it's pretty shocking.  We've seen differences of 2x all the way up to 6x between average programmers and more skilled programmers.  \n\nThis isn't even counting the underperformers because when you start factoring in the mistakes they make they become a collective drain on the team. For instance, we had one underperformer on our team that not only was he not even a 1x performer his mistakes wound up lowering the productivity of our skilled developers.\n\nSo why would Facebook save $100,000 by hiring a developer who might wind up being a fourth as productive or even less?  I hear that companies like Hudson River trading are offering new grand salaries of $340,000 for algorithm developers. I'm sure they could get a bunch of eager folks if they only offered $80,000, but those people probably wouldn't be anywhere near as productive as the superstars they hire now.",

            "Statistics bias, salary data does not consider the amount of effort to get in and required experience level compared to 2020-2021. \n\nI think data for software engineers has some kind of survival bias. This is especially true for entry levels. A software engineer's salary is calculated only for those who are actually employed. So if companies reduce the size of their software engineers' hiring while increasing their pay, the value of their software engineers' salary data will increase without reflecting what really happened. For example, if there is an entry-level hiring freeze, new software engineers' salaries are likely lower than mid/senior-level salaries, so the hiring freeze will reduce new developer salary data, which is part of lowering the average salary. In addition, many companies are originally mid-level, but often offer offers at a slightly higher salary level than entry title and entry when hiring. In this case, the actual wage has actually decreased, but statistics will show that the salary has gone up because it will be considered an entry-level job anyway.\n\nFreezing new developer hiring could inflate developer pay data more than it actually is in a few years. This is also slightly similar to survival bias. If new developer hiring is frozen, only the best and best candidates can get jobs. Since only those people were hired, the salary information is gathered from the top applicants in 1 to 4 years, so those developers are likely to move to the top companies with higher salaries, and the general level of developers would not have been hired at the time. Because hiring is frozen, most of the data on pay comes from top developers. Therefore, it will be difficult to reflect the actual salary or employment situation because it is mainly for the top candidates.",

The company stopped caring about its workers after the e.coli fiasco and more on customer retention/service. Working the line isn\u2019t bad but if you are BOH (prep/grill) prepare to fucking WORK depending how busy your store gets. Hardly anyone will spare time to help you since they have their own tasks to do. I would say go the Amazon route since it will look better on your resume than a fast food place. I don\u2019t know about your peers at your location but at mine I wouldn\u2019t say they were smart, just mediocre (my store had high turnover so my GM just scraped the bottom of the barrel hiring literally anyone that can speak English).",

EDIT: Don\u2019t trust popular guides or people trying to sell you stuff\n\n2. The best way to learn math and probability is to start with the fundamentals. I recommend Aclumus by AOPS. Create an account, set difficulty to super hard, grind until step 3.\n\n3. Take the putnam, at this point if you find the putnam unbearable quant may not be for you. All of my co-workers love contemplating problems like these on our free time and genuinely find problems like these interesting. If you find math unbearable you\u2019ll find quant unbearable (disclaimer: I worked at HRT so culture might be different)\n\n4. LC is actually not that great for learning. I recommend going through the entirety of train.usaco.org (again fundamentals). The trick with this website is that it doesn\u2019t let you progress until you solve the next problem, meaning you should be spending days or weeks on some of the harder problems. This will siginificantly improve problem solving ability and when you solve a problem it\u2019ll give you a big dopamine kick. Grind until step 5.\n\n5. Start doing past competitions on usaco.org. I personally got to platinum but being able to solve gold problems is enough for all FAANG and Quant interviews (and yes this is for high schoolers lol). If you find these problems fun try ICPC too\n\n6. Do you go to a no-name school? I did too. UIUC for Math. To get interviews simply get something on your resume that\u2019s world class. Some possibilities: Putnam score, ICPC medal, good first-author publications, FAANG internship. (I went the publications route)\n\n7. Finally follow all your usual interview advice, smell good, eat a mint, don\u2019t sexually harrass your interviewer etc.\n\n8. Profit, literally. New grad TC is anywhere from 300 (Akuna, DRW, WQ, Optiver, IMC, Jump) up to 600 (JS, 2S, Shaw, HRT, Radix, Head)\n\n9. Don\u2019t do cocain off a stripper\u2019s ass. Great in the movies but not great irl.\n\nOh one more thing, if you\u2019re practicing quant interview problems off some book or guide you\u2019re doing it wrong. Fundamentals fundamentals fundamentals. Learn transferable skills. If you want interview specific practice just apply to some tier 3 firms. There are so many quant funds its crazy. Also check this link but might be outdated. [[Quant internships]](https://github.com/quantprep/quantinternships2022)\n\nEdit: Lots of debate between FAANG and Quant. Let me say this, all roads lead to ~~Rome~~ money. The point of this post is to emphasize that you need to work on FUNDAMENTALS. Don\u2019t do specific interview prep or try to find out interview processes. If you do these things and find out you hate quant, FAANG is trivial with this skillset I promise. \u201cDon\u2019t build a house on sand\u201d - paraphrased from some bible story",

This is in stark contrast to how I and many of my peers experience the field and academic life. For example, Big Tech companies are very much frowned upon and often referred to as \"selling your soul\", even by some of our professors. \n\nI'd like to start a conversation about how you experience your time at university/college. Do you love CS as well? Are you just in it for the money? Somewhere in between? I won't judge. After all, you won't fool me into believing that ***all*** engineers, doctors, and lawyers are strictly following their passion and not whatever makes their bank accounts grow the fastest. \n\nI for example would love an academic career even if it means never setting foot in a corporation such as Amazon (which to be honest I see as a bonus) if that means I get to do what I love: CS. So what about you?\n\nAnyway, cheers and good luck!",

            "I take issue with the \"selling your soul.\" I have always been interested in CS because I want to build cool tech. Some of the coolest tech is at the big tech companies. Including Amazon. Amazon builds a ton of cool shit. That's undeniable. I have worked at insurance companies and finance. Boring. Not to say that those are bad jobs. Just not right for me.\n\nI've tried research. Don't like it. Won't catch me doing a PhD.\n\nFinally, it's not bad to want money either. Personally, making more money than my parents do means that I can help put my sister through medical school. We just shouldn't put others down for not making as much or choosing not to make as much (choosing Tesla over FB for the passion, or a similar situation). Everyone has different wants/needs. Why do we need to gatekeep?",
            "I think some mod input on this is warranted.\n\nThat this sub is mostly just about getting that $$$ is pretty obvious. It's understandable -- money is pretty important, and useful -- and I don't want to suppress the discussions around job-getting that people are clearly interested in.\n\nThat said, it does crowd out other aspects of being a CS major, so I'm considering a spin-off sub, one that's basically \"for CS majors except you can't make threads focusing directly on interviews/internships/new grad offers/etc.\"\n\nMy main concern in creating a spin-off is that there already are other CS subs that are more academically oriented, and we even have links to them in our sidebar. It's possible we could be creating needless duplication, so I'm not certain yet the best way to approach this.",

I'm not at a FAANG but I'd jump at the opportunity to \"sell my soul\" as you put it. I have family to take care of I can't purely pursue something because of \"passion\". Would i appreciate CS if it didn't lead to the opportunities? Sure. Would I major in it? Probably not.",
            "Somewhere in between (I\u2019m guessing this is where the large majority of people are).\n\nI do enjoy CS in itself as an academic subject. But I 100% do not plan on going into an academic career at all\u2014 writing research grants/papers/academic administrative stuff is just not for me and I don\u2019t particularly enjoy teaching. I say this as someone with research/TA experience and a parent who is a tenured CS professor.\n\nI also like math and physics and music approximately just as much as CS.

            "it's great that you are passionate about CS, but reading this post gave me an air of smugness that i found appalling. just like anything in life, someone's decision to work for big tech companies or to be in CS for financial aspects of it has many layers to it. Yes, it can be purely from mindless selfish greed, as you, your friends, and your professors suggest, even to the point of using the phrase \"selling your soul.\" But for many, their main goal can be to rise in socioeconomic ladder not just for themselves, but to bring wealth to his/her poor family, to provide for their children, to give back to parents, etc. one's job not being aligned with one's passion is nothing to scoff at. in short, \"whatever makes their bank accounts grow the fastest\" also can mean whatever gives them the best chance to support their children, parents, and community financially.",

You'd be lying if you said you loved driving in every city and every street. I don't love every aspect of CS. Some domains get me excited while others bore me immensely.\n\nBig tech is interesting to me because they get more funding than academia to explore the next cool big thing. They are definitely more saddled by bureaucracy and move slower, but at the end of they day they have better resources and can impact a greater number of users.\n\nI've been fortunate to work for multiple FAANGs. The jobs I loved were wonderful, but others did feel like selling my soul. If you sell your soul you should do it for at least 6 figures \ud83d\udc81\u200d\u2640\ufe0f (jkjk).",

I could understand some ethical concerns, but on balance we all commit some sort of ethical violations daily. It seems obnoxious to frown upon someone's chosen career path because it is no longer as pure as you would like it to be. What do you gain by putting others down beside some twisted ego boost?

I\u2019ve been pretty disappointed because all I ever see is Interview/Internship questions and discussion.\n\nBut to answer your question:\nI\u2019m in my first year as a CS major at the age of 24. I really enjoy programming and have interest in eventually working on Audio DSP applications, specifically for music. I had some slight knowledge of programming in C++ already so I know most of the stuff we will be going over in my intro programming course. My school teaches Java so I\u2019ve just been doing all my assignments in both Java and C++ since most (commercial) audio processing is done with C++. I\u2019m not at a top school or anything, just a small school in the southern Louisiana, but their program seems to be pretty good considering their size.",

            "I write a lot about career advice, give a lot of career advice, and do play the application game pretty well. But I also really like programming! It's annoying sometimes when I tell people that I study CS and they clearly assume I'm doing it for the money or cause of my parents. I'm not! I find it genuinely a lot of fun. And really, career stuff is **so** much easier when you like programming. I got really into compilers and started working on them as side projects. Because of that, I developed a set of unique skills which made me a really solid job candidate for compilers roles. I started applying to compilers jobs and boom, suddenly my questions are about compilers, which I know something about, and suddenly I'm getting offers. \n\nAlso classes are way way easier when you like programming. If you like programming, you'll do it a bunch. Program every day for a couple years and your classes will be a breeze. It's like playing basketball everyday and then going into a class with kids who only practice during gym classes. You're gonna dunk on them lol.\n\nHowever it is a little inevitable that this subreddit is gonna be career oriented because A. career stuff is lowest common denominator, you can know nothing about CS and still have an opinion about careers, and B. all the relevant CS stuff just gets posted and discussed on /r/programming or Hacker News. I'd love some cleanup or explicit no-career discussion posts but the reality is that /r/csMajors is probably gonna stay career stuff.",
