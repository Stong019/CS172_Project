They use a constant amount of compute to generate all their answers. Think about that it takes them the same amount of compute to answer where the Statue of Liberty is located as it does for them to attempt to give an answer to a unified field theory. That should be a huge red flag that they are engaging in a primitive form of reasoning. And it\u2019s because they are! They are simply trying to determine the most probable next token and it is becoming a clearer everyday that this is simply a powerful form of lossy compression.

I think it\u2019s good to learn C++ and Java in classes, because they\u2019re good examples of languages that are simultaneously very different and very similar, but the important thing is to just recognize that programming is programming, and then you just break out a language reference and pick up a new language. I had a student who was looking for a C# tutor. I\u2019d never used C#, but I told him, \u201cGive me a week.\u201d It\u2019s just syntax and vocabulary, most of the time, but a loop is still a loop, a data type is still a data type, and control flow is still control flow. Hence, programming isn\u2019t the same thing as writing code. The less you sweat it, the easier it gets. \n\nKid also looked at me like I was crazy when I started flowcharting the problem he was working on, but that\u2019s another story for another day. Short version, though, is that it cuts my debugging and rewriting time by way more time than it took me to make the flowchart, and I think it\u2019s a pity that most schools never bother to teach it.",

Even though I am not that experienced, I'm building projects and studying in order to improve. I have noticed that once I learn something and practice it, I don't forget it easily. In fact, I grasp the concept very well and generate tons of ideas regarding the task in question. I'm extremely creative. Also, right now my logic is garbage.

So unless you are in a top 10 ranked CS program you won\u2019t be on the radar anywhere that\u2019s considered a tech company. You can make it to industry somewhere because every company needs programmers but lower your expectations on salary by half and your chance of making it to Apple coming from an industry manufacturer or retailer is going to be pretty much impossible and getting harder every day as programming continues to shrink. \n\nUnless you are some programming god who makes it obvious to all those around them with every stroke of the keyboard your fate is probably sealed.

Ask about schools in r/applying to college? CS is highly specialized and general school info isn't very useful (ex. Harvard vs CMU). Users are getting toxic? Ban the users don't ban ability for good users to discuss. Hit up people on LinkedIn to ask for their opinions?

Knowing the ins and out of a stack you're working in is great, and hugely beneficial!\n\nBefore I begin, I have fun solving leetcode questions! But only in my spare time. In interviews, however, they are stressful af.\n\nLeetcode type problems rarely, if ever come up in the real world. But the industry asks them at all levels of interviews (seriously, some places still ask me them and my mentor who was the CTO at a profitible shop with almost 2 decades of experience and is moving on for personal reasons was asked a leetcode question even at that stage of his career, which is INSANE [he mostly, he gets scalability and hr type questions]) as a basis of understanding even though it has very little to do with your day to day.\n\nThere are plenty of \"elite\" companies that are straying away from them, and even divisions within some of the bigger FAAMG that don't use them as much as they used to! Hopefully we'll drop them and find better screener questions.\n\nThey also have tertiary issues (such as introduced bias, esp if done on a whiteboard - and also suffer from the SAT problem [wealthier people can afford to hire tutors lol]). \n\nPlenty of high level engineers use them as a metric in the interview to not go to the company they are interviewing.\n\nCongrats friend! You'll do great :)",

            "grats, but leetcode is for tech companies in tech hubs. hope no one else misunderstands that",
            "Tbh I feel like this topic is beaten to death. It should (and maybe it's not, but it *should*) be common knowledge that Leetcode is not required for every job, especially if you're not looking for a position at a big tech company. If you are, that's when grinding Leetcode becomes important. And btw by Leetcode I just mean studying DS&A problems, doesn't really matter how you do it or what you use to do it, same thing.\n\nAlso tbh, I think Leetcode actually is really helpful. I don't get why people call it pointless, after a certain extent it can get a bit ridiculous, but studying Leetcode for me really hammered in a lot of DS&A fundamentals. Graph searching, knowing how / when to use topo sort, understanding tries and other weird trees like index trees aren't used in every day SWE at every company, but studying those definitely made me a better coder and better at CSE in general. I definitely think Leetcode is far from pointless. \n\nMaybe in terms of measuring whether you'll actually be successful as a SWE is not a good measure (I'm not sure, I haven't looked into this), but I also feel like this is a really common phenomenon in a lot of application processes. Why does a college or major care about your extra curriculars when you can just show them your good grades? It's because it shows some extent of extra work you're willing to put in and that you're well versed / well rounded. Again, idk if this translates exactly the same way in SWE applications, but that's probably their thought process. Not necessarily defending it either, I think the SWE job grind is definitely super brutal and I hated it. But then again, we can also make twice the amount of a new grad engineer in other engineering disciplines, so the toughness of the interview is to be expected.\n\nedit: btw congrats on your offer!",

They had two video calls with me (all about solving technical problems) and I'm not flexing or anything but I gotta admit that those are the two interviews I really nailed in the best way that I've ever done. The interviewers told me they're impressed that I can finish the problems within only 20 minutes, and we spent the rest of time to chit chat about what projects that their company has been doing (they didn't even ask behavioral questions). I felt extremely confident after the calls and was 90% sure I would get the offer. But today I received the rejection, and the first time in my life, I emailed back to ask why I got rejected even though I completely nailed two interviews. They responded that it was a tough choice and since they had a great pool of candidates this time although they admitted that I did pretty well.\n\nI learned that performance is not the only factor that they'll consider you for the position. No matter how well you did on your interview, if there is another candidate that just does slightly better  (or more likeable) than you, you're screwed. What I mean is, there are tons of factors that are not in your control during interviews, and other candidates' performances is one of that. Lots of the time, interviewing is really a game of luck, so the more you try, the more likely you'll score what you need. If you don't try hard, you'll get nothing, and if you already think you've tried your best, and still didn't get what you wanted, that's life, but we have to keep moving on.",

But I find with each interview, I saw that now with rejection it's just on from one company and onto the other, rather than stressing about how you could have done better about the previous, put that into time into preparing for the other. (I do vent about them extensively as some just stick with me because there are some companies, in particular, I really wanted but it's just onto the next at this rate.)\n\nI got that same it was a tough choice comment when I interviewed for a role where they said they had no more feedback, but had mentioned that they were looking for people with more experience whether from more internship opportunities or schooling. ...But I had **4** internship experiences relating to the role, am actively contributing to a paper on research pertaining to the field. I know that by no means guarantees an internship but if **4** internships isn't enough I really don't know what cuts it.\n\nLike recently I prepped a product interview at a place, and it was a phone screen, a technical take home, and seeing if you made finals. I made it past the phone screen which made me like **30** of **190** candidates, and then after the technical challenge it was **10** of us. I got told those details from a phone rejection that although I had all these qualifications that fit the bill, there was just someone else with slightly more experience. It's all about headcount honestly sometimes.\n\nI could go on about this because I honestly documented like **20** frustrating experiences by now that like strayed from a conventional interview where you just introduce yourself, and try to sell yourself in hopes that you land something, but the takeaways I got from my interviews is that people just want to see a person they can see themselves working with day to day, a culture fit. I know that word's been thrown around a million times but feedback I got from peers and mentors was that \"Oh, well if someone was with you for a long time, say the time waiting to board a flight, or another scenario, could they tolerate you?\"\n\nSorry for the ramble but I definitely resonate with your experiences as that has definitely been frustrating but oftentimes you get a generic feedback cause companies don't want to get sued and HR or hiring is often quiet on this.",

            "these office jobs are something else I tell ya!",
            "Dude I was so close too, got into final interview round and I thought it went amazingly well, I got an email a few days ago that told me to fuck off. I\u2019m so frustrated, angry, sad, ugh I felt like crying and punching the wall.",
            "Waaaay better than being ghosted / generic email imo, especially after 4 interviews.",
            "Congrats \u2620\ufe0f",
            "At least they called you dude, it means that you were probably one of their top choices.",
            "Yesterday a company emailed my bf after a very good round of interviews, made him wait for a week and then said \u201cthe other candidate moved forward with the offer\u201d. They literally made my bf feel like a backup! This is extremely frustrating!",
            "Lool",
            "That's wild!",
            "I once had a scholarship send me a letter in the mail telling me that I was not selected. Before I opened I was so happy thinking I won. This type of thing is much better with a generic email that is clear and doesn't raise spirits of people honestly. Why waste our time to call  an applicant unless you want them for another role?",
            "Who cares. It\u2019s just a job. You\u2019ll be working soon and you will be like, man I got to do this for another 40 years?",
            "Better than ghosting you... I wish companies would have let me down verbally.",
            "Do you mind DMing me the company\u2019s name? I\u2019m currently in the process of interviewing for a very similar role and I\u2019m afraid it might be the same company. Don\u2019t want to get my hopes up. :(",
            "it's brutal right now, i get several rejection letters a day with how many applications i fill out. I would of flat out told them \"and you didn't think this would be better suited to an email?\"",
            "Calling just to reject is insane \ud83d\udc80",
            "Yea this is why I dropped my major as CS. The new world of CS is the biggest pile of shite since the first man to throw water over a fire pit",
            "Stories like these are why I was hella anxious when my recruiter sent me an email \\~1-2 weeks after the final round to schedule a Zoom call. Luckily, I got the offer, but they also could've just sent me an email. \n\nbtw, this was for a hardware role (I'm EE, not CS) but same idea",
            "I just got that response from Oracle last week lol.",
            "Sometimes you will get a call that you were selected and you get another call that the position is on hold. So, don\u2019t celebrate until you get the offer letter or I should say the first paycheck",
            "Tesla recruiter scheduled a 30 min zoom call  after final round to tell me I\u2019m rejected \ud83e\udd21\ud83e\udd21\ud83e\udd21\ud83e\udd21"
