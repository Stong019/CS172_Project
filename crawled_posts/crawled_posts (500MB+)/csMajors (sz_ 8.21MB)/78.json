I always feel like there is something I have to do and if there isn't something I have to do I feel like I should be studying some skill or stack or leetcoding or *something*. This is partly fine because it means I'm motivated but when it comes time to just chill I feel like I can't turn my brain off and just play a game or watch a movie without some nagging feeling that I am missing something or falling behind. I'm lucky enough to have an internship lined up finally and I expected this feeling to go away when that happened but it didn't.",

            "I feel exactly the same. Between school and internship prep I really exhausted myself and feel like I trained my brain to not relax. What helped me is every time i notice I have that feeling, just remind yourself that you don\u2019t NEED to be productive 24/7. In fact, it\u2019s counterproductive. Don\u2019t be ashamed of taking breaks and living your life- life\u2019s more than just productivity.",
            "Yeah it tends to happen both as a student and when you are working from home. For a while try setting up a space even a small space where no school work or anything is allowed. Only relaxing and doing something enjoyable. Set up time to do something in that \"relaxing space\" for 30 mins or an hour a day, whatever doesn't matter much\n\nAt first it will be difficult but keep at it and you will eventually train your brain to slow down and allow you to relax and play games or whatever it is you want to do. Eventually you might not need that dedicated space anymore and will be able to calm your mind down easier wherever you are.",

I\u2019ve been trying to spend time with this girl I\u2019ve been talking but I also need to find other things to do. I like going outside and exploring but we\u2019re currently in a deep winter freeze and there\u2019s very little indoor things to do bc of the virus.

            "I\u2019ve also always felt this. Tbh for me this isint the result of \u201ccapitalism\u201d or a productivity obsession. For me and for a lot of other people it\u2019s just our personalities. Like I can\u2019t not be doing something, and staying still (like watching Netflix or sleeping too much) it drives me insane. So honestly, if that\u2019s just who you are and what your  personality is don\u2019t worry about it. For example when I force myself to relax I am not relaxing. I let it come to me more naturally. So you need to figure out  if this need to be productive stems from your personality or internal insecurities.",

            "It\u2019s easier to relax when you convince yourself it is actually making you more productive. If I don\u2019t get good sleep I loose out on productivity the next day. I usually don\u2019t get good sleep if I don\u2019t relax for a few hours before bed. I tell myself it is important to relax for 3 hours before bed from 9-12pm and that my one job is to enjoy whatever I am doing during that time.

            "I have felt like this for a while (past 5yrs) and I am still getting used to it. This line of work requires you to get comfortable with being uncomfortable all the time. There will always be stuff to learn and always be someone ahead of you. Take things at your own pace and celebrate the small wins. If you pause and look back I am sure you will realize you have accomplished a lot more than others. If you can't enjoy life now, you won't be able to enjoy life when you do manage to get ahead of others. Life shouldn't only be about getting a job at some high tech company - there's more to it.",

There\u2019s other ways to \u201cfeel productive\u201d even if you\u2019re not doing career related tasks, I think scheduling grind time and chill time can help!

At one point, as the aggro grew, OP dissed someone for their tier 2, top 0.1% job, compared to his own multiple tier 1, top 0.01% offers.\n\nYawn.\n\nExcept: it looks like so many of you are building your identities, your sense of purpose and definitions of career success, by whether you can pass a horrible and narrow selection process to land a job in a massive corporation and make at least 6 figures, or be condemned to Looserland.\n\nThis is depressing to watch, must be even more depressing to live! \n\nYou have, and are honing, a fantastically powerful set of skills. You get to build the very fabric of our civilisation, for good and for ill. You get more chances at good jobs (more on that next), than the vast, vast majority of humanity, even in rich countries. \n\nBut you choose to define a \"good job\" as a zero sum game to get into a tiny number of companies which may in fact be a terrible, terrible fit for you personally. Or a great fit, but not as good as another. Or a superb, exceptional fit: but not the only one available. \n\nPause. Take your eye off the telescope. Look around. There are sooooo many cool companies out there. Some are big,  some are tiny. Some are eventually going to be bought by Big Tech. Some will never even have a conversation with anyone from Big Tech. But they can offer you a chance for growth, for impact, for friendship, for quality of life, for reinvention, for diversity. These things matter a lot more than brand size!\n\nSure, money matters, it's nice and all. And yes, 99.9% of companies will pay you less than a top hedge fund. But have you considered the opportunity cost of that pay rise? Who will you NOT get to hang out with, learn from, as a result of spending most of your life in that space? What kind of friendships, learnings, insights might await you in less well paying but more personally aligned work? Sure you could do with 6 figures at 22. But do you need 6 figures? Will 6 figures be even healthy for you? \n\nI have worked in fintech. With really lovely people. In edutech. In health tech. In civic tech. I have consulted for Big Tech, and for grassroots communities. And I tell you: the wide, wide world outside big tech is messy, uneven, but so rich, so interesting, so varied. \n\nLiterally no one cares past high school,  whether you're with the popular kids. It's a toxic motivation. The wrong reason to feel good about yourself. The wrong reason to feel bad about yourself.\n\nInstead, my advice is: decide what kind of human being you want to be; what kind of genuine personal relationships you want to have; what kind of impact you want to have on the world. \n\nMeasure yourself against THAT benchmark. And I guarantee, whether you get a Big Name interview and job or not, will look like a MUCH smaller problem. There will be plenty of fantastic software engineering jobs that pay you decently,  and allow you to accomplish the benchmark I suggest, often in richer, better ways than a job in Big Tech. Even if no one on Reddit has heard of that company. Even if no one outside Mombaza, or Philly, or M\u00e9rida or Geneva or Hong Kong or Cairo has.\n\nBe your best self. Be productive. Be happy. Be decent. Be financially secure. Be excited. Be useful. Be a good human. \n\nI promise you that building your self esteem along the above criteria will take you further, and if you are determined, resilient and creative, will give you professional success along the way, and even recognition. Whether that involves working in the richest 100 companies, or in the 100 million awesome companies you haven't heard of yet.",

            "I think a big reason for this is that CS has drawn in a lot of high achieving students that have been chasing prestige all their lives because of the money. Asian households especially can put a lot of external pressure on their children since prestige is valued a lot more in their cultures. So now in CS you get a lot more people that would\u2019ve been chasing a big 4 consulting job for the prestige and students who would\u2019ve became doctors/lawyers otherwise; very different from having only students that have grown up tinkering with computers and technology like past generations of CS students.",
            "Literally why I want to intern at a small start medical startup that is video game adjacent. Satisfying projects that help people but still video games. Their latest project is an AR game to be used to get patients up and moving for physical therapy as they have fun going around scanning little markers, having cute characters pop up and playing mini games with them. There are so many ways you can get involved in your fave industry, eyes on the prize doesn't necessarily mean big tech, small tech is just as valid.",
            "I'm a 35 years old woman in my junior year in college. I worked before in teaching sciences in my home country. One thing that I see all the time is the need of validation of my classmates. It feels like a show off all the time: cars, grades, internships, classes, etc. \n\nWhen I met my career advisor she asked me what I was looking for in a job. I told her: stability, good benefits, and ability to keep learning. She was surprised and happy that I wasn't pursuing a big tech company. It's not everybody's cup of tea. I suppose, as older as you get, your priorities change. Your experiences help to fix your expectations and also, to define who you are. \n\nWe, as individuals, are taught to define who we are by what we do. We introduce ourselves  like: \"hi, I'm a doctor\" instead of \"hi, I work in healthcare.\" \nMany kids are obsessed over a job because it is who they are, or maybe they believe that's who they are. Eventually and hopefully, one discovers that oneself is more than a occupation, one is more than a title, one is more than a label. \n\nAnyway, thanks for the post.

Not everyone can do it, and that\u2019s okay, but don\u2019t pretend like \u201chard work\u201d alone is doing the heavy lifting when your credential is!\n\nFor the rest of us, people like me who career switched and clawed their way up by getting a CS masters, or CS majors from other schools, if you put the work in well all end up at the same places. It might take a few years, but the tech community of people capable of solving difficulty interview problems is not actually that big.\n\nOP from that post is about to learn a hard lesson, and that\u2019s that success on the job will depend on how well they work with others.

            "I hate the attitude which you're accurately describing. I see it on another large CS-related sub. The people who are like this have believed they're special and smart their whole lives. They have nothing else to identify with. They might have been made fun of in school. They probably didn't have many dates with their preferred sex. All they have in life to feel good about is their career success. They have, they are, and they will suffer needlessly. They have, they are, and they will miss many moments of joy in their lives.\n\nMoney from Google and money from a local tech company is the same. Spends the same. Saves the same. Depreciates the same.\n\nAlso. Doesn't matter if you're salaried at $250k/year or $60k/year. You're unfortunately still a wage cuck. You are someone else's \"human resource\" to be managed and profited from. You are working class just like restaurant staff, janitors, farmhands, etc. You're not better than anyone else.\n\nLove your post. Just wanted add something.",

From what I am seeing, CS is starting to become like high finance where networking and the school you go to will matter more and I think the path of \"self-teaching\" and dumb bootcamps are over. \n\nOne thing I am concerned about is that we don't have any legislation to limit the amount of offshoring and I can't believe that we as a country haven\u2019t learned from what happened in the rust belt and the offshoring of manufacturing jobs. I highly doubt it will be as bad though but offshoring isn't a purely cost saving measure anymore because a lot of the talent at these LCOL countries are pretty good rn.",

            "Big tech and fintech are most prone to layoffs. Quant/HFT have naturally high turnover rates.\n\nGo work for Geico, they\u2019re offering around $110k + $10k sign on bonus for their new grad tech development program. It\u2019s also fully remote. If you think that\u2019s low, well then there\u2019s the answer as to why t10 students aren\u2019t Getting offers.\n\nAs for why US companies are paying big money for local vs. low money for foreign talent, well those are questions for CEOs and stakeholders. If you want to avoid getting laid off for that reason just get a gov/dod with security clearance\u2026 you\u2019ll know for sure you won\u2019t be replaced for someone overseas.\n\nAlso, statistics don't tell the whole story. There will always be students in any major that will end up underemployed. People studying psychology and sociology easily find work after college, but they don't find work relevant to what they wanted to do. I was a retail hiring manager for years before quitting in 2023, and a majority of applicants I had for part time sales had a BA in Psychology. Did we pay $50K? not even close, they got hired for the bottom of the ladder positions.\n\nA big chunk of CS grads are likely to end up underemployed as well, be it retail, food, sales, IT, you name it. It's not exclusive to CS.",
            "Edit: lmao this dude's post history is a ride. He's bombed 30 straight interviews, got a chance at FAANG and fumbled it. It's all bullshit. His failure is now the market turning against CS majors.\n\n> So I did onsite at a FAANG company today. Got 2 questions and was unable to solve both of them. The only thing I was able to come up with was brute force that was obvious. My brain froze in the middle of the interview and so did my computer in the middle of the interview. I prepared so much and it was my every dream to work for this company. This last interview totally destroyed me mentally.\n\n\u2014\n\nAnyway, hate to break it to the sad doomer CS majors who can't interview their way out of a paper bag, but the self-taught, bootcampers, and no-name state school CS majors aren't going anywhere. If you're capable, you'll find a position. Being capable includes understanding how and where to apply, presenting yourself, and knowing your value-add. If you can't do this, the degree is meaningless because you can't problem-solve at the most basic level.\n\nOne of the best things about this field is its relative meritocracy and how unpretentious and deliverables-driven it is. All this handwringing and pleading to limit the labor supply is trying to kill that. The good thing is it won't.",

I'm currently a PhD student at the same school I did my Masters and Undergrad at, all in Computer Science. The school's CS ranking has gotten worse over the years on USNews, but the perception of the school itself has gotten a lot stronger. CS ranking isn't even in the top like, 90. I had six job offers ready for post-Masters. But what I think helped was that I'm in a city with millions of people and that city likes hiring from the school now that it's popular.",

            "Is that really true? According to statistics for 2022 from The Federal Reserve Bank of New York (See: [The Labor Market for Recent College Graduates](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/college-labor-market#--:explore:outcomes-by-major)), *new-grads* in CS have a 4.3% unemployment rate with a 16.7% underemployment rate (defined as working in jobs which typically don't require a college degree). Using underemployment as a metric, Computer Science is the 6th best major. Seems like it's just the people who can't find jobs making these doom-and-gloom posts. Don't let it get to you. Reddit + online sampling bias is crazy. I agree that \"Just scrolling past this subreddit \\[shows a\\] dire situation of CS students in the US\" but... this is *extremely* biased. If you're strategic and patient you can most likely find an internship/job. To give a positive example, I'm a domestic student - switched from Mechanical Engineering to CS. With a reasonable amount of effort, I was able to get 3 internships within 1 year of switching. Only projects I had on my resume were game-dev stuff that I just followed tutorials to make. Maybe all 3 of those were just luck idk but hopefully it helps show that it's not all too bleak for domestic students.",
