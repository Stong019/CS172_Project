I've only done one previous internship at a fortune 500 company and one part time dev job at a local company. I go to a T100 state school with a 2.5 GPA with multiple withdraws on my transcript. Yup, you read that right.\n\nI am not an avid leetcoder at all either. I've only solved a total of 33 problems.\n\nAsk me questions about the application/interviewing process. Getting an interview requires some bit of luck, and I think I was able to use my available resources to full advantage. Would love to help others in my position & I hope my story inspires others.",
