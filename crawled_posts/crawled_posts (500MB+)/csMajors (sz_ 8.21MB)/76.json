Whenever somebody like my parents, coworkers, friends, etc. ask me \"what's new\" or \"what's going on\" I literally don't have an answer. It's just a grind. I don't even remember what I do for \"fun\" anymore. The last 3 years didn't feel like this, so I don't know if it is because of the pandemic, or if senior year is just like this.",
            "Yeah. Now that universities back on I also have to keep up with coursework, reading. Etc. I don't know how anyone learns anything while looking for a job. Literally all my time is spent writing cover letters and researching companies for those cover letters. Why does every company need a half a page summary of how great they are and what businesses they're involved in that I'm suitable for.\n\nI can write code. Smack that on a T-shirt and it should be enough for an entry level position, I'm not asking to join Amazon or anything.",

            "Stay up, cs is a huge field and if its feeling stagnant you probably arent exploring as much as you could. Take a break from leetcode and do some personal projects. Buy an arduino and build a hardware project, download tensorflow and write some facial recognition software, build a game or make a website, or unplug and get some exercise. Good luck definitely tough times",
            "Yeh virtual sem has just turned out to be all the work of college without any of the fun :(",
            "To a degree kinda COV-19 fucked me, I was suppose to graduate early and travel world for 4-6 months before start my job. Now I'm graduating this fall and really unsure what do myself. I can continue to work my internship but dont need money and want take break from cs. Before start 9-5 slug fest but my year started way too good so gid might be getting his revenge. At the end day, I'm at least gaining skills I would've never had if COV-19 didnt happen.",

            "Hey, I just wanna put things into perspective. If you were any liberal arts major right now in this economy, you would not be able to find a job with a comfortable salary period. You would be lucky to make 30,000 or 40,000 tops. Unemployment is the norm amongst humanities majors, gone are the days when everybody got a job out of college no matter what they studied.\n\nI can also say the same for a lot of STEM majors. Biology, life sciences? Pshhh get out of here. You can be a 40,000 dollar per year lab tech at best. Aerospace engineering? Yeah, ok good luck getting a job at NASA or SpaceX. \n\nWe live in a world inherited from our forefathers, who have exploited the environment and our economical resources to leave us a legacy where most people are rendered superfluous, and security is now a privilege which must be fought for, tooth and nail.",

            "Feeling this 110% man. These past 2 months have felt like an endless loop of hard CS classes -> apply for new grad jobs -> grind leetcode. Usually it doesn\u2019t feel so brutal but I\u2019m guessing this pandemic is affecting everyone\u2019s mental somehow.",
            "Yeah, on the one hand yes. I'm always in front of my computer screen. It's lame af. On the other hand, I can't hang out with my friends anyway, so this is the perfect time to buckle down, get good grades, and learn some skills I'll use for the rest of my life.",
            "That just happens to life in general, has nothing to really do with CS.  Everyone goes through ups and downs and lulls in life.",
            "Amen to that. I seem to have to alternate days between full days grinding out work without rest to the following day mostly in bed to recuperate. I am just getting so tired. I am a freshman, so I can\u2019t compare my experience to anything else but I just hope things get better",
            "Not really because I have a ton of hobbies, nearly none are affected by the pandemic. My travelling goals were but there's plenty to see and do in my own province/country. I have been feeling like school is a drag though.",
            "Yes.",
            "I feel the same way :( This week was also midterms, so it's been super crazy. Early mornings and super late nights -- it almost feels a little suffocating because the school life vs work life vs personal life gets all screwy. And to top it all off, I just miss seeing my classmates/friends.\n\nI started taking up new hobbies like Tennis and PokemonGo and it's actually been helping quite a bit! I hope you're doing ok OP! We'll get through it",
            "Learning to cope with this will be a great skill to have. This job can just be monotonous sometimes.",
            "I'm now pursuing a post-bacc CS program, so I jumped late on a moving boat. I only have two years for loans and internships. I try not to compare myself but then I see everyone with projects and research experience, and I have basic, limited, applicable work experience. With just lab homework.\n\nI should be happy though, I did get some responses for interviews, but I didn't prepare enough for the technical portion. My Algorithms and DS classes come later this year, so I'm SOL for most of them anyways. I'll try to take my time in finishing my projects and grinding LC and hope next year is more forgiving.\n\nThat said it's all online work and I was already someone who spent most of their time doing computer hobbies: gaming, surfing the web, reading e-books, etc. So the monotony sucks and Winter is coming for us in Northern Hemisphere. That'll have everyone trapped in more. GGNORE",

We're taking this action to ensure we're best positioned to succeed during and after the current market downturn. We remain bullish on the long-term future of crypto and Coinbase's position in the ecosystem.\n\nFor some of you, we have already set up time to speak further but for those who haven't reached out, I wanted to proactively share this information with you and I'm here if you need to talk! Feel free to reach out if you have any further questions and we can't wait to welcome you to Coinbase soon\n\nThank you!",
