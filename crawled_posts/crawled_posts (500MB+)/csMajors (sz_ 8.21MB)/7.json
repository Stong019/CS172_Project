As an international student, the journey was nothing short of daunting, but here I am, a testament to the power of perseverance.\n\nThe path wasn't easy. I remember my first interview at Bytedance; it was a disaster. I froze and couldn't speak for 20 minutes straight. It was one of those moments where everything you've prepared just vanishes.\n\nFast forward to now, and I've received 3 offers, including one from a company that had previously rejected me. In a twist of fate, I've decided to accept this offer.\n\nTo everyone out there struggling, I want to say: your next offer, your next interview, your next opportunity is on the horizon. Keep pushing, keep striving, and most importantly, keep believing in yourself. The road might be tough, and the nights long, but the dawn of success is near.\n\nKeep going, everyone. Your time is coming!\n\n#InternationalStudent #InternshipJourney #Perseverance #SuccessStory",

Got a free AI and ML masters, and leveraged it for a job shortly before graduation. Albeit, the job was SWE, but it pays well so I can\u2019t really complain.

I graduated with my B.S. in 2006 - and saw the 2008 recession where it was even worse than today apparently for software engineers. Fortunately, I was doing a PhD in CS from 2006-2013. If you get into a decent PhD program, you will expect a tuition waver and a stipend as long as you're covered by your advisor's research funding as an RA, or the department's teaching funding. I would not recommend paying for grad school\n\nEither an M.S. or Ph.D. has been historically required for most data science and machine learning engineer positions. Although, I have seen the degree requirements becoming more relaxed through time. Graduate program and publications can open up exciting fields such as generative AI/machine learning, scientific computing, advanced graphics, etc.",

            "My masters was basically a two year long networking opportunity with people who had their shit together more than I did.\n\n\nThat being said, it was exactly worth 2 years experience, so going directly into industry would have been fine too.",
            "I don\u2019t get why CS acts like it\u2019s in this special category of BS is enough to land a great job at a top company just because, as compared to other STEM fields. You normally do not find this in the natural sciences at least\u2026\n\nAfter doing my bachelors in chemistry and biochemistry at a top 50 school, it took years working as a contractor for a pharma company before being brought in as an FTE at that company. Now they are paying for my masters in CS as they hope I can apply what I learn to benefit the company. \n\nYou can also apply for jobs that are related your bachelors through the skill you learned, and aim for one\u2019s where the benefit is tuition reimbursement towards a masters. That way you get the money, you get the degree, and you get the experience/time to apply it."

            "Even worse are the influencers saying all you need to make 6 figures is do my 6 week React bootcamp. No degree required.",
            "When people talk about GPA like this I get the feeling the feeling they\u2019re the same type of people that just get the degree for the piece of paper. If you put genuine effort in understanding the course material I cant see how someone can have anything lower than a 3.0. Whats the point of going to school at that point?",
            "Bro cmon with this gate keeping nonesense. Don't pretend like 70% of the people here aren't here for the same reason. You heard CS paid a lot so you are doing it. And no it's not just the influencers fault. The industry pushes \"learn to code\" on everyone because it's in their best interests to get as many candidates as possible, no company wants to pay 200K for you to write 10 lines of code a day. They will sponsor people to promote courses, certificates, and overall want to promote an influx of CS grads. A lot of \"influencers\" are also recruiters. The influencers and people who create bootcamps are just the ones smart enough to sell the shovels during a gold rush rather than partake only in the rat race. People relying on an entire industry, that publishes its salaries publically, being kept a secret are the only ones who should be blamed for being that naive.",
            "Maybe this is a bit ignorant to say coming from a 3rd year cs student. But all these influencers are always new grads. Like wtf do they know about working in the industry? Sure more than me, but I feel like they've only had a taste of the real world yet they feel like they know everything.\n\nAre there any good CS influencers older than 25 that anyone is aware of and can recommend?",

            "Problem with influencers is that they oversimplify things and make it seem super easy. Buzzwords, scams, \"boot camps\", are easy to bait people in.  \n\n\nI don't want to discourage people from going into CS, I actually would encourage more people to do so, but its not a walk in the park by any means. It takes a lot of hard work and effort to be successful. In my experience, the math and higher level classes weed people out.",

            "I hate the ones LYING about their success or salary to get a band of losers that want to take to the easy way out. It took me 5 years before I broke into six figures. I have a masters degree and worked at the government as an engineer. I cannot stand the lying and the crappy boot camps",
