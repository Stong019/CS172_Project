I don't know about you, but I'm getting tired of constantly trying to prove myself just because I'm a female in computer science. My grade only has 15 women in computer science out of 100 people. There's like 2-3 other women in my courses, and I'm just tired of it always being this way. The guys almost never take what I have to say seriously, and if a guy answers a question that I actually said earlier, suddenly everyone else believes it. Constantly getting belittled in my abilities is only the start. \n\nThis morning, we had a breakout room and they were talking about how our professor sounds really cranky over emails. Someone in response said that it must \"be his wife that sends his emails then.\" I know that not all guys are sexist or misogynistic, but dang... it gets tiring when you're around the ones that are. \n\nOH but not to mention the \"you only got those internship offers because you're a girl.\" I somewhat agree, that probably plays a little bit of a role in companies decisions; but that doesn't mean I didn't do countless hours of LeetCode, fill out 132 applications, work hard in my courses, fail coding interviews, and keep up with sexist slums everyday.\n\nAnyways that's just a little rant, hoping things get better when I'm in industry and HR is a thing :/",

Although you could reach out to people and make your own group of people. That's easier said than done.\n\nI hope your upcoming classes have better minded ppl tho.",
            "Honestly I feel the same. In my first programming class (called advanced programming where we learned some data structures and algorithms) in high school, there were only 3 girls out of 30 and my teammates wouldn't completely trust me in the group projects (I think just because I was a girl). My confidence got shredded and almost didn't want to apply in CS for university and I imagined how toxic the environment would be. This was around February 2020. However, I saw many girls in my introduction to CS and intro to software systems class last semester, of course more girls than I thought and people were more supportive and nice than I thought. I also joined the women in tech/CS organizations at my university and met a bunch of other girls with similar interests. \n\nBy the way, do you know Rewriting The Code (RTC)? It's a great global organization for female students in tech!\n\nYou go girl!",

It\u2019s really difficult to be happy about my internship because it\u2019s been heavily implied by a few peers that I only got it because I was a girl. But you don\u2019t pass technical interviews by being female. I\u2019m also tired of being labeled \u201chardworking\u201d when my male peers will be labeled \u201cintelligent\u201d when we have the same accomplishments, grades, etc. It\u2019s not that hardworking is bad, it\u2019s just hard to be seen as technically talented when you constantly have to prove yourself. But I see you, and I\u2019m proud of you if that helps at all!",

            "i feel this so much. i\u2019m a woman as well, junior in north texas, and ugh man, does it suck sometimes to be a woman in this field. i feel like i have so much to learn since i switched majors and everyone around me has been doing this for ~ 10 years. i absolutely love this field though and I\u2019m so determined to learn everything  and more. i just wish i could pause life to catch up. \n\nwe got this this OP! i believe in us. i\u2019ll see ya in the field in a couple years:)",
            "Absolutely feel you! In my previous college, I was typically the only girl in my cs classes so I personally felt I had to prove something to all those guys. I was too afraid of asking questions and I tried my damn hardest to look like I knew everything the Prof was talking about. Let me tell you, after I completed my first project in the class, I open up my grades and saw that I received a zero on the project. Attached to the grade was a WHOLE essay about how I shouldn't give up and that as a woman in the field it can be really difficult blah blah blah...\n\nI immediately contacted the prof and he just told me I didn't do the correct project. Low and behold after confronting him about it and asking exactly what I did wrong I come to find out that he just didn't run the correct file type.\n\nTalk to people about their expectations of you and realize that for all of your perceived \"advantages\" in the field, those people will never have to deal with all the crap you do.\n\nGo girl!

            "In my intro to CS class there was this one kid who constantly mansplained Java to me even though I had 3 years of experience with it, and he would always try to \"trip me up\" and catch me getting wrong answers. Come a few semesters later, he and I got grouped up for a project and he ended up being the one asking me for help on a lot of it :) you've got this, stay the course & see if you can find organizations like WiCS, SWE etc on campus, or join national/intl orgs like Rewriting The Code.  \n\nHaving a community of women around you in solidarity really does wonders -- at my school the women in tech orgs are super tight knit, and the people in them sometimes all sign up for the same section of a CS class, not only so they have people to talk to/work with, but also to show everyone else in the room that yes, women DO belong in tech & that the room being almost half full with the most intelligent, motivated women I know is the norm and not an exception. They also have a lot of workshops and panels talking about what women experience in the major & the workforce after graduation, and men usually come to these events to educate themselves on how they can be allies",
            "Honestly... fuck those guys. I have MAD respect for women that choose to pursue a technical field, because they're actually passionate about it. I mean... with a class filled with 90%+ boys (not men, just boys), I can understand that it must be tiring AF to hear boys say the same shit over and over again. But you'll build some thick skin by the end of it.... oh and..... use that shit as fuel for the fire. That's what I do, when someone is talking shit to me.\n\nI'm also a sophomore, and I've managed to accomplish more than the people that have belittled me in the past (but I stay humble about it to their faces).\n\nI honestly wish you good luck on your journey, and I'm sure you're hell of alot better than the boys who talk shit.\n\nGood luck on you're journey, and always remember... the only person you're trying to prove anything to is yourself.\n\n:)",

            "I definitely feel this way in my classes too where our cs program is only 25% girls. I think one encouraging thing I\u2019ve seen is other girls in CS supporting and encouraging each other, whether it be through WICS or other orgs. I had a girl TA once who put the only 4 girls into one discussion group so we all got really close which was super kind of our TA to do.

            "Show them your Leetcode pie chart and they will all fall in line.",
            "Probably this is only an American thing or something, but over here in Asia, female CS students aren't really looked down at, at least in top universities. Yes, this is still a male-dominated field in representation, but the girls over here are equally respected as the guys in CS. Many of us even felt that the girls are stronger since they are more hard-working than the guys.\n\nIf there is anything, the whole \"You get your internship because you are a girl\" still exists everywhere. It's partly true because a lot of companies want more gender diversity in their workplace, but that doesn't mean the one getting in are incompetent or undeserving. Ultimately, you shouldn't care about other people's opinion - treat it as jealousy, ignore it, and go on with your life :D",
            "the smartest people in my classes are girls",
            "I\u2019m so sorry you feel this way. I am a STEM female student as well and there really isn\u2019t much of us out there. I am majoring in Statistics which overlaps with a lot of CS subjects and I really wish I had my male classmates\u2019 confidence sometimes.",
            "I'm a guy and this shit has happened to me my whole life. I find in male groups there's usually only one or two people that are listened to and everybody else are there to agree. I don't know if its the same in groups of girls but in male groups you need to make guys listen if you have a point. Yea its tiring. But hatred is a good motivating force.",
            "Totally relating to this!! I\u2019ve also found it harder for a girl to work in a group of all guys - sometimes they just don\u2019t really take you seriously and give you the easiest tasks even if you may know better than them. I also hate the social dynamics of being the only girl in a group cuz it sometimes feels lonely and alienating",
            "We are all rooting for you.",
            "I have the opposite experience but in a different field. I was the only male in the whole studies for four years, including the professors. I must say though, I never felt excluded or patronized. I don't get why people act the way you tell, I used to think people that are in higher education would get more aware and sensitive of the situations they're in. This being not the case makes me sick.",
            "I think diversity and inclusion has a good mission but the people it tries to include into field can make them feel alienated once they join it, because then everyone forgets the hard work but only sees \"diversity hire\" which is frustrating for the person and the people calling the person with that name.... So as long as the numbers don't ramp up in this field the minorities would be alienated and we have to accept it that we are the sufferers for something good in the future (hopefully).\n\nRanting is a good way to reduce that frustration.",

            "Also female in CS! I was a tomboy growing up though who always had \"boy\" interests so those things never really bothered me and to this day I'm not quite sure why. I know friends who've shied away from CS because it was so male-dominated that they didn't want to deal with potential situations like the one you mentioned. I think part of the problem is representation as well because when we think of stereotypical coder its usually a white male in a hoodie hacking away in his basement. Unfortunately, the gender gap is getting worse, not better, according to a recent study (maybe if I find the link I'll pop it in here later). \n\nBut to see real change? I'm not sure even where to start with that tbh. There are organizations like Girls Who Code that I volunteer with but a lot of the young girls I work with are either really confident in their interest or feel that it's just not for them? In terms of the later, I try my best to be encouraging and show them that anything is learnable though effort and practice, but there's this intimidation factor or discouragement they get that is hard shake through and they just quit or don't show up anymore. \n\nSorry for the wall of text! but these are just my thoughts and experiences. \n\nThanks for posting this btw",

I said, I don't think my bf would agree with that. 2nd idiot was like, you have a boyfriend..? With that mentality? Would he have said that if I were a guy?\n\nAlso recently posted something about visibility in my 4K monitor recently, one guy's response was ..\"you know that type of monitor is for work, not hobbies...\".\n\nI am a software dev, and this monitor was sent to me from work lol. Then he proceeded to tell me he was freelancing in UX so he knows the industry. Asked him to add me on LinkedIn, I think my resume speaks for itself.

My peers and lots of friends are at the top of their fields and are female. I know it's very sad to hear sexist comments and I really don't know what will be the solution for this problem but remember you don't have to prove yourself to someone. Don't let that get to you.  Keep working hard as always and you will definitely end up at a better place than the trolls",
            "Also a girl in CS, and I totally get it :( It's rough, but in terms of internships, I try to remember that if someone is sexist, it's them failing to be a decent person, and it's not a reflection on me. If women really have a much easier time getting internships, then why are most interns and engineers at the company men? They just want to invalidate your accomplishments, but in reality, your accomplishments are all the more impressive because you've gone through the same difficult application process that they did, on top of all the additional challenges you faced in even making it to this point. I guarantee if some of these sexist assholes had to deal with being talked over in class or at work, other people taking credit for their ideas, being the only man in an office, etc, they'd have quit the field much earlier. You're a badass for making it this far, and you should be proud of how well you're doing - here's hoping we make it better for the next generation of women trying to make it in tech. :)",

I've actually met several other female students and professors who have only made me feel more hopeless about getting internships and myself in general because of how intelligent and good they are, on top of the fact that they're female... really humbling.",
            "Hi! I'm a CS Alum, female, and currently working in a developer role. I've also done undergrad research into why girls are so underrepresented in the compsci field. \n\nThe obvious reason is just general sexism towards women in STEM, but it does extend back a little further than that. The rise of our major as we know it now came from when the first personal computers were marketed to the public American audience. When these computers were first sold, the software that was primarily used was marketed towards an American male audience, so outside of using them for work, there wasn't really a reason for women to use a personal computer. Due to that, it caused a sharp decline in the number of women entering the compsci field, and thus created the internal bias that \"women don't work on computers brrrrr\". Is it messed up? Absolutely, but I digress. \n\nBesides that, I just want you to know that I've been where you are... I was the only female in my computer science program at one point at my community college until I moved up to a larger institution to complete my bachelor's degree, and even then, there was only a handful of us in the program. I faced a lot of that same bias from peers and professors, and the only thing you can really do is when they say \"you only got those internship roles because you're a girl\" is say \"no, I got those internship roles because I passed interviews with flying colors\". You don't have to prove anything to anybody other than your ability and your work ethic. It's not up to them to decide your worth as a programmer because of your sex/gender. \n\nAs for the workplace, if for some reason you feel they are discriminating against you for your gender/sex, I can tell you that they're probably not someone you'd want to work for anyway. Find yourself a job that celebrates your identity, and I think you'll find once you do, the people you work with will feel the same way! \n\nI know its tiring, but you're doing something really cool, and I encourage you to keep up with it! If you can, look for support groups or create them yourself to build a network so you have friends you can discuss these problems with. At my college, we had a WiCs group (Women in Computer Science) that would meet weekly to offer that kind of support.",

Yes, you'll still have to work with the guys in your classes, but it's nice to have other women to bond with over internship applications, classes that you *do* have together, etc. By the end of my degree we had such a great group of women going that we always knew someone in our classes and had a dedicated place we could go for help/to vent when we needed it, it was really nice!",

Especially *hated* when teammates decided I would be responsible for frontend without asking me (I swear it was because one of them thought as a female I had better design skills or couldn't handle the backend???). Have met some guys with big egos and very little coding ability trying to boss people around. Not impressed.",

We are all studying the same thing, so similar knowledge should be assumed. \n\nI don't know how big your college is, but my CS program is pretty small so we are all tight and learn from each other regardless of gender, sex, race, age, disability, etc. Hell, we even have a blind guy that everybody looks up to because that dude is a genius! \n\nMy professors will call on random students to answer questions, and not just xyz group of people. Our programming team is a mix of all groups and nobody I've spoken to has mentioned the ladies on the team as anyone different from the guys. \n\nIt angers me that people treat you all differently because you are all there to learn and to pursue the advancement of technology. Everybody should see each other as the same, as equals.\n\nI don't think this can be fixed, though. I know this stems from different cultures and groups convincing their men that genders have roles. Ironically enough, I go to a small college in the southeast US, so I would think racists/sexists would be prevalent, but thankfully not. \n\nAnywho, make it your goal to ignore those worthless people and try to form your own support group of like-minded CS students and just do your best!",
            "Maybe my school is more progressive or whatever you wanna call it, but we have tons of programs and outreach for women involved in stem. In my classes I\u2019m actually partnered up with these two girls I met last semester because they are some of the smartest people I know. Very skilled in coding and very good with communication. Maybe it just differs by school, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a ton of bias at my school, just a gender difference there\u2019s still more guys then girls in the engineering majors.

It is something I fortunately never have to worry about for myself. CS is hard as it is.\n\nI try my best already to be as inclusive as I can, but is there anything I (or other men) can do to help minimize misogyny in STEM (beyond not being \"sexist\" ourselves)? In order for this to change, it is going to take a lot more than this, but I want to do as much as I can to be as helpful as possible.",
            "I'm sorry that you have to balance so much. \n\nSchool work is already hard enough and you have to also deal with this talk and living in general. \n\nWorst part about this is speaking up doesn't help either. And it's already tiring being in their virtual presence.\n\nI say speaking up doesn't help because 1) might end up being in same class again later 2) they'll just say to chill or you're labeled as uptight or a bitch 3) you have to be prepared for what comes next and gear up those English speaking skills\n\nI still say yes to speaking up because looking back, I have regrets of not having said anything even if results are bad. \n\nBetter to do it than to later regret not doing it.\n\nI hope you find a supportive friend group who are also talented, brave women and in tech, such as yourself.",
            "You NEED to stick with it! Some of the best coders I know are female, and they get mad respect. I\u2019ve been in this game for over 20 years, and I\u2019m seeing more and more women showing up and it is great! There are a lot of wanna be\u2019s out there, and honestly all of them are guys, trying to pretend. If you have the chops and you can create and architect solutions to real problems you will be more than fine.",
            "Congratulations on your internships and I commend your work ethic. Unfortunately, This is definitely a regular occurrence in the tech industry but I hope you find solace in the fact that it will not always be this way. The more experience and value you command in the industry/role, the less impact your gender will(should) have. I will say this is an uphill battle for women, but from what it sounds like from your experience, you owe it to yourself and other women to keep pushing through and exemplifying your skills.\n\nBest of luck to you and I hope you have a fun and successful career.",
            "I\u2019m female too and that\u2019s how I felt at times in college too! It gets better in industry, it\u2019s still male dominated, but there\u2019s females in higher roles and who are key decision makers. Don\u2019t let being one of the few females bring you down. I think befriending other girls in your class or joining female engineering college orgs helps. I see a lot female coding clubs too. There might be other girls around you who feel the same, so support each other! And overall just stay away from jerks, don\u2019t let them get you down."

She said their biggest problem was finding things for the interns to do that would be the best to help them learn. Especially finding tasks they CAN do without expecting too much. I can't speak from experience because my internship was completely cancelled due to covid and still got hired as a full stack .Net SWE 1.5 months after graduating.

            "I had a hybrid internship and I was a lot more productive in the office then at home. I have a fully remote internship next summer and I'm kinda spooked. In my defense the work was super boring (aka my ticket would be to update a projects libraries to work from CentOS 7 to CentOS 8) and the project would take 3 hours to run each time. For the most part I only had one ticket at a time. So I would literally either help out other interns in the office while it's building or do chores back home.\n\n\n I had several full time employees apologize for how unlucky I was to get literally the most boring tickets. I had one dude tell me he understands if I don't come back because my experience was probably worsened by the tickets I got. I spent three months out of eight updating libraries. Learned a lot about debugging really complex c++ so can't complain too much. Point is, if the work is boring it's so easy to get distracted.",
            "Literally my entire internship was this way. We were a team of two. Other guy did the entire project almost just by himself and he would work on weekends just because he wanted to impress our mentors. We both got a return offers. I rejected because I had better offers, he took it because it was the only offer he could get. Life is not fair sometimes. It doesn\u2019t matter how hard working you are. It matter how hard working you can pretend to be.",

You can kinda/sorta get in everywhere else on this list with enough dedication and LeetCode but Jane Street is more for the Putnam Fellows/IMO medalists. You've either got it or you don't and that's what makes it stand out.\n* Stripe's product frankly isn't that interesting to me but their engineering culture is phenomenal. Sort of like a Google from 10-15 years ago.\n* Google and Two Sigma are both known for being great high-paying places for \"engineers to retire.\" Pick your poison I guess. Two Sigma is a little harder to get into but it's also smaller and not everyone likes finance.\n* I have a strong personal distaste for FB which is why I ranked them so low. They also fire people easily. They pay a fuckton in terms of TC but, for me, it wouldn't be worth it.\n* Apple is a good company but it's not really the greatest software engineering place to be at.\n* Amazon is just a shitshow. There are good teams but taking an Amazon offer is tantamount to gambling whether you'll get PIP'd in a year. I'd never work at Amazon personally.",
