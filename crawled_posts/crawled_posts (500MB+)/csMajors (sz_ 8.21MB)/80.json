Almost everyone who sits on a stage like this will say 'It is vital that your children learn computer science' and in fact it's almost exactly the opposite. It is our job to create computing technology so that nobody has to program. And that the programming language is human. Everyone in the world is now a programmer. This is the miracle of artificial intelligence\" - Jensen Huang\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Coding was never the source of value, and people shouldn\u2019t get overly attached to it. Problem solving is the core skill. The discipline and precision demanded by traditional programming will remain valuable transferable attributes, but they won\u2019t be a barrier to entry.\n\nMany times over the years I have thought about a great programmer I knew that loved assembly language to the point of not wanting to move to C. I have to fight some similar feelings of my own around using existing massive codebases and inefficient languages, but I push through.\n\nI had somewhat resigned myself to the fact that I might be missing out on the \u201cfinal abstraction\u201d, where you realize that managing people is more powerful than any personal tool.

            "I am going to make a killing fixing the mess people make copy and pasting AI code with no understanding. Just because I can use a pencil, a calculator and a hammer doesn't mean I can design and build my own house.",
            "People who are relatively new to the field (or are students) make too big of a deal about coding.\n\nCoding is, by far, the easiest and most fun aspect of being a software engineer. It's a privilege that is granted after you have fought all of the production fires, nailed down the requirements after extensive talks with clients and your tech leads, and gotten an approved design.\n\nL3's get to code a lot, because it's the only thing they really know how to do. You code less and  less after you hit L5 and try to get to L6--not because you become a slower programmer than the \"younguns\", but because you become responsible for actually understanding the problem space and solving problems. Code is just a means to an end, and shouldn't be glorified like it's some sort of inifinite-skillcap talent that continues to get more and more useful as you get better at it --- there is certainly an asymptotic ceiling to it, and it the ceiling is surprisingly low in most software fields.",
            "You see a lot of kids coming through now that think, as long as I can code the same way I speak English, I don't need to think about anything else.  I can bin off personal skills, orgnaisational, emails, career development.  As long as I have this one or two languages nailed, I've made it from now to retirement.  \n\nUnfortunately, they find out the hard way this gets old very quickly, and then they have no idea what to do.  Now they can't even get the job in the first place.",
            "Carmack is so rich he hasn\u2019t cared about anything for decades. Don\u2019t take your advice from people like that.",
            "I mean it\u2019s all fun and makes sense. Issue is, using language if you have to specifically describe your desired task and intent, there is no way that is clearer and easier than pseudo code. \nSo maybe you can have weak syntax skills if the models are trained often enough or the languages don\u2019t mutate. \nBut telling the LLM what you need will end up being code unless you have some boilerplate business need that is already templated to hell and back in GitHub and you simply didn\u2019t know.",
            "Whenever I ask chatgpt to write my code it sends back some smug snippet with half of the methods and libraries made up.",
            "I agree with what he is saying. I am using ChatGPT extensively to avoid writing boring code. I want to solve the problem fast and I am thinking about the approach and architecture. Coding itself is just moving bricks.\n\nThe problem is that if coding is no longer a barrier to entry salaries will be brought down to earth. Sad times.",
            "Carmack's right. Anybody can write code. It's not some sort of wizardry. The thing that always made Carmack great was the manner in which he solved the problem at hand. If you look at the Quake III engine, it's just an incredible work of architecture, and that's before you even start looking at the code. \n\nNow, by, \"Anybody can write code,\" I mean you can take someone who took a couple of Java classes in community college, hand them a bunch of UML diagrams, and they'll knock out the code you're looking for, but they might not be able to come up with the structure that got you to making those UML diagrams. *Writing code is not the hard part*. That's why a lot of programmers are going to get replaced by AI, and rightfully so. But it'll take longer for people who really understand architecture to get replaced. It'll happen, eventually, but at some point you end up in a situation of diminishing returns, where someone will say, \"Okay, make a 3D engine,\" and then have no idea what it should do, and the AI won't know what they mean, either.",
            "Yeah but that's what being a software engineer has always been about. It's not about coding per se, it's about problem solving. And that's why I think CS majors have a huge edge over bootcampers, and I don't think many companies understand it either. We have the internet, and now LLMs, so it's not that hard to go from one language to another. Software engineering is more about how you're going to implement the requirements of the client, and working with them to implement the best possible product, within the constraints of time and budget. Taking those decisions over what frameworks to use, libraries to use etc is the problem solving.",
            "What they really mean is \"be fullstack\". Or even better, fullstack+, which means understand how to talk to users and do marketing.\nI practice, we're far from having AI maintain code bases, especially legacy onces, so programmers are going to have to keep on programming.",
            "So you're telling me, if I use chat gpt for all of my assignments, I am problem solving, and will be fine?",
            "Head of a company whose whole value is tied to AI being the future says what? \n\nAI sucks for coding. I have regretted every time I have used ChatGPT or Copilot to write even basic code. I don\u2019t see it getting any better for at least the next five or so years. It may never fully learn how to solve problems or write complex architectures. So, yeah it\u2019s too soon to be taking these statements at face value.",
            "Yeah kids should learn to design parallel computation arch",
            "I am sorry, I needed to read read the article twice becuase I was laughing so hard. Here we are (In South Africa) struggleing to find devs. Because who programs the Ai.",
            "Seems like we will just have a natural language spec, that won't be all that different to code imo. You tell the AI what you want and specify the parameters in detail to avoid misunderstanding. Basically still coding, without having to know a specific coding language.",
            "I see people misinterpreting this. \n\nThat's fine. \n\nNeed to trim the excess supply in CS that accumulated over the years.",
            "TLDR: Coding is already commoditized, and the only ones who don\u2019t realize this seem to be billionaires and frightened students.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of like claiming that having the ability to read and write music (\u2026 not create, mindlessly notate scales for textbooks) is somehow your personal moat. No, it's your ability to take that input and transform it into something meaningful and contextual, something that helps and uplifts others.\n\nI'm not referring to the future; that's what development is today. Someone else mentioned L3s doing all the coding, and that's right. It's because they are missing the process and domain knowledge that actually gets shit done. It\u2019s why intern programs are really just campus tours and the only thing they really bring to the company is a streamlined hiring pipeline.\n\nThe future isn\u2019t going to be dropshipped from LLMs, lmao.",
            "As a newish grad I agree, very excited for the prospect of working on bigger and more complex problems. I love to code and spend almost all of my time doing it, but since coding has been created we have been doing nothing, but abstracting it to higher levels for easier understanding and building bigger things. The inevitable evolution of this was to get it to human language so I\u2019m not really sure why every one is so shocked? Maybe it\u2019s because they didn\u2019t expect it this quickly?",

            "These people are nuts. Kinda makes sense how the hiring of devs is so jacked. People that don\u2019t know shit are trying to talk about knowing stuff.",
            "I think anyone who\u2019s good at and has made a career out of writing code understands that coding is and always has been but a tool. It\u2019s an applied domain, it makes life easier in general but is not a domain which has any value in and by itself. \n\nThe coolest problems solved through code are always cross-domain applications, from medicine to driving and so on. So I\u2019m not sure why anyone is surprised. \n\nYou should still know how to write code, you should know how to apply it to a domain of your choice and you should be good enough to solve problems in that domain. But you still need to be aware of/knowledgable in domains other than programming.",
            "I respect carmack a lot. I disagree with this sentiment. If you are a good problem solver you know that we have a long way to go before human language can be used to create real products or new research by code generation. Perhaps one day we will get there. Even if we do you need people to analyze the results or know where to put the generated code at. Plus not to mention the legacy code based that exist\n\nI'm not saying these guys are wrong I'm saying that this type of thinking is a goal that still requires people to work hard and get better at problem solving. Learning and improving your ability to code will continue to pay dividends.\n\nI'm sure we will have a higher level language similar to human speech but that's a ways off and as long as it's code being generated then we still need good programmers. It will just be a big productivity booster",
            "Time to start consultancy firms with really really lucrative rates.",
            "The real skill that someone only using AI wont have is problem solving. Cant tell chatgpt to code something when you dont know whats wrong. Additionally, chatgpt gives me wrong code most of the time and says things that are incorrect. It has gotten even worse in my experience. We are not close to having it replace SWEs.",

The important thing is to let kids get their hands dirty and make things. And to make things today they need to learn how to use today\u2019s tools. The concepts they learn today will help them as software development continues to abstract further from the hardware.",
            "Yeah agree, instead they should do tik tok and only fans.",

            "Lol that's a stupid ass offer. Good on you to end it early. They probably outsource everything to keep costs down. And if they do have local devs, I cannot imagine them even breaking 70k in NYC. Sad.",
            "you did good. not everyone just has couple grand to drop on an internship \ud83d\udc80 especially in nyc\n\nedit: i came back and reread this thread and a lot of people are saying how this was dumb. i know this cycle sucks and any offer is better than no offer, but literally, even if this cycle was good, some would never be able to afford housing in a random state, NYC on top of that. I\u2019d rather take a shitty pay with housing or stipend, because it\u2019s less worry. even if I was getting paid like $55/hr, i probably wouldn\u2019t be able to afford first month until pay\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f i\u2019m sure many can relate. don\u2019t take housing compensation lightly, it\u2019s a big deal in an offer.",
            "$20 is peanuts for NYC. Holy cow, some companies are so cheap.",
            "I had a similar thing happen. Got an offer to work on a AAA VR game for $15/hr remote. The catch was I had to live in LA with no relocation or stipend. Math was not adding up so I didn\u2019t take it and was a plumber for the summer while working on projects, ended up making more as a plumber than I would\u2019ve at this AAA studio",

            "I wouldn\u2019t accept an internship that didn\u2019t provide housing either. I feel like if you started the interview though you should at least finish it. I feel like the extra hour or two couldn\u2019t have hurt and you only stand to gain by getting the offer even if you don\u2019t accept it.\n\n\nEdit: housing or stipend. Sorry I thought it was obvious that I meant both since the focus was on the cost.",

            "Everyone saying \u201cany experience > no experience\u201d missed the fact in OP\u2019s post history that they have had a past internship at a big tech unicorn and a 4.0 at a target university. Even if they do not take the offer and \u201cdo their own thing\u201d, OP will end up fine recruiting for new grad in the future.",
            "I would\u2019ve taken the job tbh. You can get a summer sublet in New Brunswick (where Rutgers is) for cheap, and take the train into NYC. Lots of affordable areas in NJ if you look outside of the Hoboken/JC/Union City area. \n\n$20/hour is too low for NYC, but if it\u2019s your only offer, then that\u2019s unfortunately what you\u2019re worth rn. You also could\u2019ve accepted the job and kept looking, and then reneged if you got something better. \n\nPersonal projects are nothing compared to actual paid SWE experience, sorry.",
            "Realistically you could have done fine on 20 dollars an hour in NYC and not had to lose money. Sublet one room (look around fordham) for 3 months in the Bronx - 3000 in total, transportation (subway) - 500 (overestimate), food - 1500. Let\u2019s assume this is a 12 week internship, 40 hours per week - you make 8,700 after taxes in NYC. 8,700 - 3000 - 500 - 1500 = 3,700 to save or spend at your leisure. \n\nBut I don\u2019t know you, what you value for living situations, transportation, safety, etc. Living in NY isn\u2019t easy, I\u2019m not saying the above math is reason to have taken that offer, I\u2019m just saying it is very possible to not lose money (unless you account for the loss in money that could\u2019ve been saved if you had worked elsewhere)",
            "A lot of people in the comments seem to be missing the fact that any offer >>> no offer.",
            "Okay as someone living in New York and as someone who successfully lived in New York on $2.5k a month, I'm gonna be devil's advocate.\n\nOn Airbnb or Facebook marketplace you can find an easy 1 bedroom studio over the summer for $1600-$1900 monthly studio in Brooklyn, Queens, or Staten island (where you can find $1300 1B) . If you cook your own food and use public transport, I think it is more then doable to live off of less than $2100 and save the rest.\n\nNow, 20 per hour is about 2400 per month take home after taxes and 401k deductions. ( But you save more and are taxed less if you live in, say, Brooklyn or Queens .... basically outside of manhatten)\n\nI'd say take the internship if you are okay with knowing you won't make as much as many of the people living there. My  2 cents.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit - Also, In ALL of my faamg interviews, my start up experience was most of the conversation so the work of building stuff in a start up will be valuable in your career but lmk if you want me to talk more about that",
            "Speaking from experience if you don't go out to eat like every single day you should be fine with that compensation in NYC. There're usually a lot of students that will go home or travel during summer so you can sublease their apt for lower price and you don't need to spend a lot on moving. I'm assuming you'll be working full time thou.",
            "Honestly\u2026 I know that\u2019s too little. But I\u2019d take it. Especially if I need the experience and I\u2019m on a deadline.\n\nBut good for u for not taking it, especially if you can afford to.",
            "Can you ask them to make it a remote internship?",

            "blockchain experience is gonna quickly be a chain around your leg tied to a block of concrete",
            "I do think there is a benefit to having an internship versus just working on projects. I think some people expect a bit too much when it comes to internships. I\u2019d personally value the experience and resume value over whatever they pay you.\n\nFor context, I had a software development internship at the department of justice in the cyber division going into my junior year of college. It was based in Virginia/DC with no relocation (I was in California) and paid $15/hour. I still took it and luckily lived with a distant cousin near there.  Although it didn\u2019t pay much, I definitely think it helped my resume.\n\nThe next summer (going into my senior year) I was a software engineering intern at Northrop Grumman in Aerospace Systems. They paid me $26/hour with no relocation. For a broke college student, I was ecstatic and also felt it helped my resume.\n\nI\u2019m now almost 3 years graduated from college and have worked full time at Microsoft (2 years) and currently work at Google. So although my internships didn\u2019t necessarily offer any great benefits or pay, their contribution to my resume and skills I think made a big difference, versus if I just did my own thing. \n\nThat\u2019s just my opinions so take them with a grain of salt but good luck!",
            "It\u2019s not a good internship but literally any experience is better than no experience.\n\nOne bad internship > almost any project",
            "Yeah fuck that they are just crypto douches taking advantage of a juniors devs desperately trying to get in",
            "Bro, this market is absolutely garbage. In my opinion it\u2019s better to have an offer than nothing. You can keep grinding while at least having something to fall back on. Been looking thru the comments, don\u2019t come asking for advice only to tell people off & disregard everything without thinking about the advice people trynna share man lol",
            "Dodged a bullet. Scam artists.",

            "It was a good choice, I would expect $30 at the very least for New York for an internship. They should put the $20 per hour money into their full time developers salary, basically an extra $20 per hour. I highly doubt the full time employees of the companies are getting even a decent amount compared to other what other common are paying",
            "Should have gotten an offer, accepted it, then ghosted the company last minute because of how shit their pay is.",
            "The housing in NY is astronomical, so it's a wise move to reject the offer. If you were living with parents in NY it might work, but it's not a good offer otherwise.",
            "Ask for remote. One of your first lessons as an intern is to communicate your needs. The second lesson is to propose solutions. $20/hr remote makes sense for both parties.\n\nAlso gives you a chance to take another internship.",

            "Unpopular opinion: You should\u2019ve taken the offer and reneged if you got something better. Internships have alot of intrinsic value via resume brand. Trust me, it\u2019s day and night between work experience vs no work experience applicants in terms of competitiveness for new grad positions",
            "It depends if you are willing to pay money out of your pocket to gain VALUABLE experience and if they do really offer VALUABLE experience. Valuable experience would be work experience that would give you an edge over other people that might be applying for the same future job you want.\n\nThe problem is that it might be a company taking advantage of you because they cannot afford you.\n\nNY is tough and you need to go to NY with a solid job offer in your pocket.  If not, you will be a slave looking for work for minimum wage.",

            "You made the right call, though personally I wouldn't have even interviewed with anything blockchain to begin with.\n\nI know you young'uns probably don't have a whole lot of leverage, but asking for pay up front is generally recommended. Though, wait, didn't NY pass a law like that where they have to state it up front?",

Note that results may vary because when leetcode Q\u2019s are asked in technicals there is always some randomness. \n\n\nNo technical: Ford, GM, Lockheed, Northrop, Vanguard, John Deere, 3M, nationwide, (any midwestern company or extremely non tech focused company). \n\nEasy technical (results may vary I\u2019ve seen random leetcode hards at these places but majority of questions are easies): JP morgan, Cisco Meraki, IBM\n\nMedium technical (expect to see a leetcode medium, but if you\u2019ve solved blind 75 then you should pass these companies technicals 80% of the time, they won\u2019t ask non-pattern questions and I\u2019ve not seen leetcode hards): Amazon, Oracle, Goldman Sachs, Capital One, Facebook, Lyft, AirBNB, pretty much Fortune 500 tech company that I haven\u2019t listed in hard/impossible.\n\n\nHard: expect to see tons of complex mediums and high chance of a hard. You should solve the grind150 list in its entirety to be fully prepped: Microsoft, Google, Citadel, Uber, Palantir, unicorn startups, Snapchat, TikTok.\n\nImpossible: Code and Pray: Jane Street, Akuna (every question was just a WTF for me. Leetcode doesn\u2019t help that much, they expect you to know TCP/networking concepts and system design. Every question was either about multi threading/networking or a 150 line leetcode hard)",

I always ask candidates about their failures and mistakes, things they learned, and how they would do it differently if they could go back. This is a critical part of demonstrating your value as a long-term employee.\n\nEveryone in a tech field has past failures and mistakes. If you cannot talk about them openly, this means you are either hiding something (maybe even from yourself) or you lack valuable experience.\n\nWhen you make mistakes or bad decisions in your career, remember this and think about them often.
