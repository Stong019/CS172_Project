            "Like everything else, the CS job market ebbs and flows. A few years ago you could get a job by fogging a mirror, with nearly no CS education or experience. With the recent, massive layoffs there are thousands of people with BS degrees and good work experience looking for jobs. Now there is real competition for attractive job openings. The era of boot camps is pretty much over. If you don't have a degree, things are pretty bleak right now. If you go to a good school, land some internships, and get good grades you should be fine. Although the bar has been raised, there are still a lot of good jobs out there.",

            "Apart from the interest rates, IMO a couple big reasons why so many CS grads are unemployed:\n\n1) university CS programs grew too large. At my alma mater, in 2020, CS was the second-largest major right behind biology (which was our pre-med factory). \n\n2) lots of them are straight up unprepared to become professional software engineers, usually due to lack of professional experience but mainly due to lack of soft skills. These students cannot pass the behavioral portion of interviews. Think of the average redditor, and... yeah... that's not the guy you would want in your team",
            "The tech market crashed at the end of 2021 and has barely started recovering, there's just fewer total jobs than there were at the starting point of the crash.  Some regions are worse off than others though.\n\nCombined with that is the fear that AI will take all our jobs and there's just a huge amount of negativity and fear with joining the software industry right now.",

But then I would see so many candidates from top tier schools struggle with it.  Of course, I cannot recommend that they proceed with the hiring process.  I\u2019m not sure why that is.",

            "Job market is a market, it\u2019s a never ending positive to negative trends",
            "Read through most of the comments and have a few additions I saw missed:\n\n1) Pre-covid many major tech companies would hire programmers not because they made they would necessarily lead to a direct profit from their work but because they wouldn't work for other (competing) companies. When the interest rates went up and money became more scarce, these companies dropped everyone who wasn't making a profit anymore; therefore, all the rest of the companies felt better dropping these employees too. This is why it seemed like every major tech company was laying off thousands of employees left and right. This means that suddenly the market was flooded with a bunch of ex-FANG employees that recruiters may misconstrue to mean they are better than non-ex-FANG employees.\n\n2) Ghost Jobs, job postings that will lead to a job for nobody. There are a couple of reasons someone might make a posting like this (Scraping Resumes for data or collecting resumes for future similar openings, to name two). The existence of these causes people to be much more likely to apply for a ton of positions without reading all the position requirements; or, as we are talking about CS majors, just spam apply via AI. This means that a legitimate recruiter might get 1000 resumes for a single position but most they wouldn't even consider. They then may need to manually filter through to catch people who automatically optimize their resumes with an AI based on the job posting. Jamming up the whole process.\n\n3) Foreigners (non-US citizens) looking for green cards. In the last paragraph, I said 1000 resumes, which may only be 1000 resumes from people who are legally allowed to work in the country, they may get an additional 1000-2000 from various other countries that wouldn't be able to work in the country. Again, slowing the whole process.\n\n4) CS is a relatively new but relatively (internally-)specialized industry. If you are hiring someone to program OS stuff in low-level C you don't want them to only have worked in Scheme before. As interest rates are higher and there seem to be lots of applicants, companies are more likely to try to hire someone who already knows most of what they need to do the job rather than having to spend 50-100k training someone. (This honestly might get worse since Congress recently banned effectively all non-competes, so you may end up training someone who sees a higher-paying job at a competitor)\n\nAll this means that life sucks for everyone here, job finders have to apply to hundreds of jobs to find one and recruiters have to look through hundreds of resumes to fill a position. And recent graduates with little experience aren't in much demand. But hey, at least you're not me who has had no job experience since a college summer in 2019 due to chronic health issues, and the only recent work I've been is only effectively Master's Degree level personal research projects that nobody is going to see as being worth shit.\n\nTLDR: Don't get into CS if you are doing it for the money, it's unlikely to be any better than any other STEM field anymore. If you enjoy programming you should be able to do well and get a job though.",
            "There are two misconceptions repeated in this sub.\n1. Jobs grew on trees for juniors before. \n2. Jobs require pedigree now; anyone below {arbitrary benchmark} is fucked. \n\nThe truth is that your school (or even the fact that you went to get a CS degree) has almost nothing to do with how well you perform as an employee. It's an almost entirely different skill set. People applying to a thousand jobs are doing something wrong or are overweighting their experience in 2023. Anecdotes come from unreliable narrators, and you don't know what else is holding someone back",

Learning from this to hopefully apply to a larger, more tech-orientated organization. It\u2019s also great to apply the methodologies from CS into these other fields.

Think that this is how every profession goes, for a time becoming a lawyer wwas an automatic guaranteed of a high paying job with not too much competition, as people realized this was a possibility then more and more started to enroll in law, and now you have the present moment where you can certainly make a lot of money but you can also find yourself unemployed or with a meager salary.",

It seems like the job market is in the early recovery stage and it will take a little bit to get back to a healthy spot. I could be wrong though. \n\nBesides that, it seems like a lot of other fields are struggling too. I currently work in healthcare, laboratory to be specific. And we ALWAYS need people. But the big wigs don\u2019t want to hire more people so they are running on thin margins. Basically we were told that if someone leaves, they aren\u2019t refilling that position. Even though we need it. It\u2019s all about money at the end of the day. \n\nEither way, tech is not going anywhere unless something apocalyptic/catastrophic  happens. I feel like the best thing you can do is get your degree so you have a one up. After that, just focus on being adaptable and improving your skills. Take what you see here with a pile of salt.",

Right now interest rates were just raised substantially which damaged the market. But it will recover.\n\nSoon with the AI boom we will become even more productive than ever and demand for software engineers especially high skill software engineers will boom.\n\nThere is no need to be afraid. Especially if you haven\u2019t even started your degree yet. That\u2019s plenty of time for the market to recover.\n\nRemember that people mostly don\u2019t make a thread bragging about their success. Reddit has a selection bias and it\u2019s mostly people posting about failures.\n\nThe unemployment rate for software engineers in the U.S. is below the national average unemployment rate by a significant margin.",
            "Videos take months from idea to edit to produce. What was true 6 months ago isn\u2019t true now.",
            "Multiple things adding up:\n\n1) Investors are now being super anal about tech companies and their finances. Previously hiring was good for a company because it showed that the company was growing; this made investors happy. A result of this is that many, I'd even say nearly every, big tech company over-hired. Because of the current state of the economy, companies are now laying off the extra headcount they've previously hired; flushing thousands of very qualified engineers into the market. These mostly include people that were hired for projects that the company is no longer pursuing (cough Google and their 100 projects), people that provide the \"least\" value i.e. lower performers or junior engineers that are easier to replace, etc. \n\n2) There's been a large economic shift towards AI; this caused a lot of big tech companies to shift their focus to AI and drop any projects that aren't immediately profitable. A good example of this is Google + Facebook shifting their hiring to Data Engineers, AI engineers, and people for their main apps (FB, Youtube, GSearch, Meta, and IG). TLDR, any high demand projects have headcount but positions for one off projects were completely eliminated.\n\n  \n3) Lots of companies are offshoring; I've seen this happen increasingly across almost every company. There's a ton of incentives to hire people from India, Latin America, and Ireland + it's much cheaper to hire people there. An example of this is my company which has nearly shifted 90% of our openings to roles in Dublin. \n\n  \n4) The reduce in headcount, the offshoring, and the layoffs of capable engineers made the job market absolute hell for new grads/people in general. There's so many junior engineers available in the current market that most junior eng roles are filled up + team match hell is back for alot of big FAANG (i.e. being stuck in team match until app is closed). There are almost zero available roles for people with under 3 yoe at the moment.\n\n  \nAll that said, I do think the market will turn up eventually. Tech is still the most valuable asset in the current market. If you're really into programming, I'd still learn programming. The job search isn't too bad if you make an effort to network and build your portfolio like others here have mentioned. You can build apps and put them in the Google play store for example. There's always a pretty good demand for mobile engineers and having successful apps make you stand out.",
            "You can, but then, you\u2019ll be competing with a lot of people. You\u2019ll be competing with the people who graduate same time as you, as well as people who haven\u2019t gotten hired from 1-3 years ago",
            "I feel like the tedious and annoying jobs. Related to webdev, UI/UX and maybe cybersecurity will disappear with time but I can't imagine the core \"computer science\" parts being effected too much. Programming desktop applications, drivers and so on doesn't seem like something you would want AI to do. Sure you can use it for certain applications but you won't be completely reliant on AI for those.\n\nAlso, I believe atleast this level of \"cleansing\" was necessary. Too many people with subpar fundamentals who just join frontend, UI/UX and so on because of the attractive salary while having terrible experience. I feel like these are the same people making fuss about how the work load is too much and whatnot. If you are experienced enough, you will know how to handle a certain degree of workload. If you aren't experienced enough then you will take a LOT of time and effort to do the same thing. This is fine but it isn't good when this happens for things taught in college elaborately.",

Now years of seeing \"lucrative vloggers\" vlogging their jobs into google and seeing how the company culture in google was shown as fun and the income being stable, everybody jumped into CS. Now you got this over supply of candidates + AI is actually playing a really important role as well, even as student you can see yourself relying on chatgpt and such, some big compnaies have their own model to work in-house only reducing the needs for people to write codes, the person who knows which direction to go in can now just use AI to write code and make some corrections.",

However, all my previous specialist recruiters are not very responsive until the current one\n3. Regarding my attitude towards Google, I love the company that's why I applied. Companies have ups and downs, and the market loves a good comeback story. Think about Ballmer's Microsoft. If you locate yourself using Apple Map on iPhone, browse in Firefox to search on Perplexity or upload videos to Vimeo or receive emails from Yahoo dot com. Good for you!\n4. Regarding my attitude towards this hiring process, I'm not fond of passive-aggressiveness; it's the opposite of being constructive and decisive. From my perspective, switching me back to an outsourced recruiter feels reminiscent of the PIP culture at the other well-known Seattle company, which is just passive-aggressive. That's all I want to share with this post",

            "Okay, I dealt with this same thing OP. Google wanted me for a cloud engineer position and they reached out to me. This was like three years ago. I remember eventually I told them if their hiring process was an indicator of work environment then I did not want to be a part of it. I remember they assigned me a recruiter, then they would go ghost for weeks. When I inquired they apologized and gave me a new recruiter. The new recruiter reached out on behalf of the old one and apologized, said they would take good care of me, guess what? They went ghost for weeks too. Then I reached out explaining how I was not getting responsive communication and THEY were the ones that reached out to ME. Soon enough I was informed by a NEW recruiter that the last one had changed roles or something to that effect. Well take a wild guess on what happened next. Yup, the new recruiter went ghost after a few emails again. They eventually assigned me a fourth recruiter and I politely expressed that I was not interested in anything Google had to offer me. This whole process literally spanned about 6 months. It ended with a recruiting manager reaching out and throwing everything at me to give them a chance, they wanted me to fill out surveys why I didn\u2019t want to work at google. I just politely declined. Once every month or so for about six more months they would email me asking to reach out. I was through at that point and moved on. Soon I got a job offer by Amazon. And well friends\u2026That is a story for another day.",

            "I will never understand why someone would even feel the desire to work at a place that treats people like this. \n\nSame thing with apple and their months of interviews; it just makes no sense. \n\nThere is plenty of money to be made and professional satisfaction to be had at other companies that don't treat (potential) employees like it's a privilege to work for them.",
