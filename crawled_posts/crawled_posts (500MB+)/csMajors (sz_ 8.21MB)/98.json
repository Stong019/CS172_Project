        "selftext": "I love that there are communities such as these to help CS students in their school and their careers. Lots of invaluable advice and insight can be taken from places such as these.\n\nIt's an unfortunate reality that there will be toxicity in basically any community you go to. In CS, that toxicity often tends to take the form of extreme pride and arrogance. The idea that you're a failure if you don't get that internship/job at one of the most prestigious companies, that you're doing something wrong if you're not leetcoding 23/7, and conceited and egotistical people making you feel inferior to them bc they've had an internship at a Big N.\n\nI don't know who needs to hear this, but absolutely none of this speaks for your worth. I know the race can get to people's heads and it's very very easy to feel like you're not good enough if you're not achieving ridiculous goals. This impacts people's sense of self worth, confidence, and gives them impostor syndrome.\n\nI know several people who work both at big tech companies and not. After you break it into industry, it stops becoming such a huge deal. I know people who make less money at smaller companies, who get messages from recruiters at Google, Facebook, Netflix, w/e, but wouldn't leave for the world, because they're happier there. At the end of the day, being a software engineer will still mean you're one one of the most well-valued professionals in the world. You'll be well off, whether you get a FAANG-type job or not.\n\nWorking in this industry isn't just about prestige. It's finding a place where you can have a good work-life balance, a place where you can enjoy financial stability, and most importantly, a place you actually look forward to going to every morning.\n\nIf you don't get the job you want right out of college, it's not the end of the world. You work in industry for a few years, better yourself, keep learning, and never stop trying. It'll happen for you sooner or later.\n\nAnd please, lift each other up, help each other in this quest, don't tear each other down. You don't know the person on the other side of the screen, you don't know what damage you might be causing them when you tear them down to make yourself feel better.\n\n[https://www.tiffanymatthe.com/not-extraordinary](https://www.tiffanymatthe.com/not-extraordinary)\n\nPlease don't be rude in the comments. I'm bringing this up because it needs to be said once in a while, and especially now with recruiting season upon us.\n\nBest of luck to everyone this recruiting season! Keep your ideals high, your hopes higher, and never let small failures stop you from continuing to strive to be the best YOU you can be.",

            "You know, when I started my career, my goal was always to make it into a FAANG company. And after 5 years and finally achieving that dream, I realized it's just another company and just another milestone. Work is still work, and no matter where you work you'll find people that are awesome to work with and people you could care less to see. At the end of the day, it doesn't matter what company you work for. So long as you enjoy what you're doing, you're perfectly fine where you are. Also, don't feel that you need to be in FAANG to be a great software engineer. I've worked with loads of people who aren't in FAANG but could probably code circles around me. Just focus on yourself, and everything else will follow.",

            "\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb strong agree! I\u2019ve heard a few years out of college and you\u2019ll hate the recruiter spam.",
            "This is very true. Prestige wears off incredibly quickly. I had what should've been a great internship in NYC and hated every minute of it. \n\nThough I just ended a 4 year relationship because I accepted a FAANG job in one part of the country and my girlfriend will be working in another. It was an incredibly hard decision and I still don't know if it was the right thing to do. The first few years after college are very significant as you begin to mold your career. But I don't know if I'll look back in several years and regret parting with one of the only people in this world who truly cares about me. ;(",
            "I'd be honest here, to me it's just a rat race. I also don't understand how people are desperate to be working in companies like facebook/netflix. I understand the good pay and all but social media and entertainment? like seriously, think about getting 4 year CS degree having done computational analysis and math only to allow people to react to posts with colorful emojis , letting people watch movies. Just an example here, the core of these companies are still kinda useless to me.\n\nIt is just sad that people dream about working in FAANG, basically sign up into this rat race will lick arse to get a job in one these companies and then feel accomplished. Like boom #success lmao. It's just hilarious to watch people fiddle around FAANG discussions.\n\nEDIT:\n\nBefore people misread me.\n\nFacebook is definitely beneficial on several instances, like for businesses, connecting people and what not. Netflix definitely has a complex system with challenges (optimization, scale, efficiency, speed, fun stuff imo) as an user mentioned. Both are great companies to work for nonetheless. However, this is not what this discussion is about.\n\n\\- Few things I want to highlight:\n\n* They're all great companies and that's it. Period.\n* trying to over-engineer oneself only to get a FAANG job, not worth it in my opinion. Just unnecessary stress in this already stressful century. There's so much more to life and CS goes a long way.\n* The mentality that if you do action A then action B will happen, leads to a toxic environment (as OP mentioned). Everyone's unique, so *can* be the approach.\n* Softeng practices can be good and standard wherever.\n\nRecently there's been countless posts about leetcode/facebook/faang leading to linkedin discussions in this sub-reddit. To a lot this can seem overwhelming/tiring so to reiterate what OP said FAANG is not the be-all-end-all of CS. Also CS/tech/seng is not what this life is all about. To people who are over-stressed just calm down. This all is ***just my opinion.***",
            "As a 31 year old CS student, 60 doesn't look as far away to me as it does for some of you early 20-somethings. Trust me when you are in your late sixties, looking back on your life, you won't give one solitary shit about having made it to FAANG. \n\nYou'll be thinking about whether you spent enough time with your kids, and what you can do to bring light to your grandkid's lives next weekend.  Maybe take them to the museum, or sit with them and help them code their first game.",
            "As someone who has absolutely 0 interest in FAANGs,  I'm tired of everyone talking about them. I have family members that worked in some of them and left because the working environement was just unhealthy, downright toxic at time. They are not a paradise. I think we need to prioritize people's happiness.",
            "Yes I\u2019m glad to see someone say this! I got an offer at a non-tech company for much more than I would have at a FAANG company, with a laidback working culture. The idea that everyone needs to work at FAANG is like high schoolers thinking everyone needs to date a cheerleader lol. Everyone has different priorities and there\u2019s different ways to get there!",

Too often I see people say \u201cjust do more projects/internships\u201d when for lots of people that already have this, more of the same won\u2019t help at all.\n\nI\u2019ve seen countless students with 0 projects or internships get personally recruited by top companies simply because they go to a top 10 CS school in the US. I\u2019ve also seen countless students with incredible projects and multiple FAANG internships struggle to get interviews because they go to less prestigious schools.\n\nIt\u2019s gone so far that on lots of job applications, there is a university dropdown selection where you can either select \u201cHarvard\u201d, \u201cMIT\u201d, \u201cStanford\u201d, 5 or 6 other universities, and then \u201cOther\u201d. Companies literally screen out students who don\u2019t go to top universities. \n\nI understand why companies do this; those schools attract top talent, and it\u2019s an easy way for them to hire strong students/graduates without having to review tens of thousands of resumes.\n\nAgain, I\u2019m not writing this post to complain; I\u2019m writing this because I see so many people posting here wondering why they\u2019re not getting jobs when they have past projects and internships.\n\nThere is a huge economic barrier for people who can\u2019t afford to go to top schools, which makes it difficult for getting jobs at the entry level. As much as it sucks, if you\u2019re struggling to get a job at one of your dream companies, you might need to first get a full time role at a smaller or mid-sized company, and then once you\u2019re 2-3 years in, companies won\u2019t care about school name and you\u2019ll have a better shot at scoring an interview.\n\nAlso, consider getting your Master\u2019s. People on this sub preach that a Master\u2019s won\u2019t help you, but if you get it at a top 10-20 CS university (which many companies are willing to help cover), you will be amazed at how many doors it opens.\n\nTL;DR - If you find yourself struggling to get internships/new grad jobs, even with experience and projects, just know that school name plays a bigger aspect than most people realize, and you might have to work for a few years or get your Master\u2019s before you have a shot at your dream job.\n\n*Edit: Before commenting \u201cwRoNg I gOt A jOb WiThOuT a ToP ScHoOL nAmE\u201d, please read the second word in the title \u201copinion\u201d.

After a year I'll start my masters, probably and Georgia Tech or UIUC and after that hope to get a job at a top tech company.\n\nSome notes\n\nFor internships I think it depends on your bubble. Everyone here wants to get a tech job at FAANG. There are plenty of relatively small (market cap wise) midwestern companies that just show up at the local university and hire accordingly.\n\nObviously if you are from MIT this helps and if you are trying to get a FAANG internship or any internship in the first 70 companies on this list (roughly) [https://www.levels.fyi/internships/](https://www.levels.fyi/internships/)  then name is honestly going to matter more than anything else.\n\nI think subs like this and and a very interesting Tiktok/Youtube subculture have created this hilarious illusion that everyone is going to get a job at FAANG upon graduation. Most people simply aren't good enough to work at these companies in their life, much less right upon graduation.\n\nI think everyone could if they tried, but if you are still using the same sort of approach that got you into the middling university, then I don't know why you think you will get into a really great company for your job and internship.\n\n**TIPS ON GETTING TOP INTERNSHIPS IF YOU ARE NOT AT TOP UNI**\n\n\\- First one is funny, but figure out a way to visit a top uni. If you go to UMass Boston, legit just take the ten minute drive to Boston and MIT and enter the buildings, figure out a way to join their clubs , attend their events, LOL. I did that at UofT when attending a nearby university.\n\n\\- Figure out a way to network. This can be hackathons, this can be doing research at a good university, this can be working on open source projects, etc. The goal is not necessarily to get anything out of this immediately, but you just need to put yourself out there because the more people you meet, the more opportunities present themselves and the more things you learn.\n\n\\- Apply and put effort into your website, portfolios, etc. If you are from a lesser known university then unfortunately I already have a bias towards thinking you don't really apply yourself (this is from a person that didn't attend a very good university for undergrad). Your projects, website, etc. need to be on point.\n\n\\- If you are struggling to get a paid internship, then do some research at your university. If your GPA is good this should be paid by some sort of grant. If your GPA is bad then you literally failed at the only job you had up until that point LOL, and for that your punishment is working for free. This is where I got my start and it really helped to get me that first internship. Try to do this as early as possible and a 4 month research project with a professor is enough.\n\n**Last note**\n\nMarket is tough right now, if you do thing correctly you will still face a lot of issues, but you'll get somewhere. Most of the resumes that I have a misfortune of seeing are still very bad. However, when I do have two or three good candidates, but only one spot then it does become a game of luck. Stay strong, do your best, remember to calm down and you'll be ok.",
            "Really?  Are you a hiring manager?  A recruiter?  How long have you been working in the industry?\n\nI'm not here to deny that certain employers tend to recruit at certain schools.  Most certainly geographically.  And your first job may be easiest to get through your placement office and on campus recruiters that show up.\n\nBut my spouse and I graduated in CS many, many moons ago and have a kid that graduated in CS recently and I have seen plenty that doesn't align with this black and white view of tech and new grad hiring.  I worked for an employer that stopped hiring from an elite school after a few poor experiences with new grads and had a higher bar for them to jump if the most interesting thing on their resume was the name of their school.",
            "I disagree with this, I have worked for plenty of companies and a couple faangs and wasn't once asked what school.

Keep in mind this does not include smaller schools such as cal tech Harvey mudd etc. additionally I would argue that going to a less prestigious school, if located in a tech hub, (think like cal poly slo) CAN allow for greater recruiting outcomes than great schools that have sub-par locations, such as SUNY Stony Brook.",

At the end of the day it comes down to pure chance for the hiring manager and the position they're speaking to fill. Prestige school might get you the interview, but if you fail in other fundamental area's you're not getting hired.\n\nIf you're getting out of high-school and you want to improve your chances because you have a particular company you dream to work for, sure go ahead and go through whatever the cost in order to get what you want. These school's you're all paying 10x the price for is about the experience anyway and that potential extra + on your resume anyway. I literally made money off scholarships to go to a no name college and get my bachelors and have worked at a major corp. Why in god's name would I pay $60,000 a term when I completed my degree in half the time and the result was the same?\n\nBecause I researched the company I wanted to be apart of and stood out in different ways, I applied myself.\n\nFor the MAJORITY of people they need to focus on fundamentals and really just having passion for what they're doing. \"Do more projects/Internships\" is because the MAJORITY just zombie-walk through college and don't apply themselves in any way, and wonder why they can't work as a top engineer making $250,000 for Google. THAT'S why it's said.\n\nEven if I am incorrect about all of that, to suggest everyone should take out giant predatory loans and do whatever it takes to attend these prestigious schools for what amounts to a piece of paper is just wrong. Plenty of these companies, even FAANG, have opportunities even if you have NO degree. Does that lower your chances of landing your dream job compared to a Harvard graduate? Probably, but none of us know an individuals particular circumstances. Or what the hiring manager/company is looking for. \n\nMaybe you're a top of your class UBC graduate with no passion or skills just trying to make alot of money with no real interest in CS or maybe you have no degree but have demonstrated your abilities through your own personal projects that grabs a hiring manager's attention.\n\nIf i'm ever part of a team that's just hiring people I depend on because \"they graduated at harvard lol\" then I'm finding a new job.\n\nTL;DR\nDepends on the an individual and the hiring manager.

Put it this way if you go to university of Waterloo (most interns my team has ever hired came from their coop program) or a bay area school we recruit at (I actually don't know which ones specifically but Berkeley is a solid bet) your chances of getting an internship are an order of magnitude higher than eg. MIT or Harvard just because we don't fly people from California to Boston to recruit at all.  (We actually do spend a lot of money to fly people to Waterloo and do interviews bc we've had great success with Waterloo interns in the past + the market is super competitive with other companies).

            "Terrible advice. If you find an open api and build out an entire react app that interacts with it, you have a great project on your resume",
            "If I see more algorithm-esque projects on an entry level resume, I'll assume it's likely another school project. It's going to look like another project that many other students have probably done as well, a project which doesn't take a student out of his/her comfort zone to actually learn other important aspects of development. \n\nA project like that does not show that you know how to work with frameworks. It does not show that you know how to deal with dependencies. It hardly shows anything at all. It's like taking a leetcode problem and claiming that as a personal project. It would not stand out at all (to me).\n\nWeb apps show that you have likely dealt with APIs at some level. Building APIs is a generally relevant skill that many students may not have had enough experience with.\n\nWeb apps can also involve many parts. They do not need to stop at the front end and can include middleware and DB components. A fully functioning web app (one which actually utilizes data stored in a DB) suggests that you have a breadth of knowledge that spans the full stack. It shows that you can actually hook up components together yourself rather than rely on some skeleton project base that your processor provided to the class.\n\nAnd as others have said, a web app provides an actual thing to look at and demo. It's tangible. It shows that you actually have something to show for your efforts rather than some text which could easily have been made up.\n\nThe problem with web apps is that so many students list cookie cutter projects that are obviously school projects. For those projects, it's hard to tell how much of the project was you following step-by-step class instructions or whether most of it was built by another class group member. But if you build a unique web app that you are personally interested and invested in, that effort will likely show through to interviewers\n\nSo the problem is not that students are only doing web apps. It's that they've only done hand-held projects with limited scope or limited personal input.",

        "selftext": "Just blowing off some steam as I gotta talk about how much I hate hacker rank tests. For some background, I am in my senior year in university for CS with a minor in business, I took 2 years off school to work at a startup company making mobile apps as a full stack engineer. I am deeply passionate about gaming and game development, and I am looking to become a game developer, and eventually make my own game studio.\n\n1. Riot software engineering internship\n\nSpent so much time tailoring every aspect of my application and resume to get this internship, contacted 20 previous interns at Riot, a senior engineer at Riot, 2 engineers at Epic Games, and had them all review my resume/application, then applied immediately after applications opened. I even made a 3D video game where you play as one of the characters in league of legends and walk around exploring my portfolio projects in game.\n\nThis did get me past the application stage and as someone who was ignorant to leetcode tests I thought that just getting an email back was going to be the hardest step; I thought the coding test was going to be the easy part because I'm confident in my skills as a developer. I got the hacker rank test, it was 5 difficult questions that built off of each other with a 2 hour time limit, I was a fool to not practice more before hand, but, I still completed 4 questions with all passing tests, and did not start the 5th. I literally spent like 25 minutes rereading the 5th question because it was so difficult to understand, I swear they did this on purpose, I couldn't even understand what they actually wanted so I couldn't spend time thinking of a solution. Regardless, I thought 4/5 was pretty good, but apparently I wasn't even worth getting an interview, I just received an impersonal \"better luck next year\" no-reply email from hacker rank, which I cannot even do as a senior. Feels bad.\n\n2. 2K games engineering graduate program\n\nDamn this program looked awesome, one of my favorite game publishers, a 21 month program (full time work, paid!) where the first 3 months are hands on training in game development in unreal engine, then they place you in one of 2K's studios, rotating you in a different studio every 6 months so you get a feel of what you like to do, then they (hopefully) hire you permanently afterwards. What an amazing opportunity. The job emphasized the necessity to be proficient in C++, from my background I did not do much C++, so I spent many hours grinding and learning everything I could know about it. I got past the application stage, got my hacker rank test, it was 1 hour time limit, 7 multiple choice questions about C++, then 2 leetcode questions. I am confident I got all 7 multiple choice correct, but the struggle came from the first leetcode question. I spent 30 minutes, half of the entire duration of the test, just re-reading the god damn question, the examples that were provided contradicted themselves, it was extremely long, and all in all made no damn sense. If I was given this as a requirement in a real job, I would throw it back and ask the person to rewrite the whole thing. Once I finally understood what the output was supposed to be, I coded up a naive solution in the last 10 minutes and passed half the tests, the other half were testing for efficiency, which my algorithm wasn't. I literally feel like there was no amount of preparation I could have possibly done to have passed that test, I feel totally cheated. I sent a heartfelt email to the recruiter asking for the chance to continue to the take home test, and was ghosted. I'm pissed, and depressed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know that I shouldn't be worried about 'dream' opportunities and should focus on getting anything, and that is exactly why I haven't stopped applying to places. I've applied to about 60 places so far, which may be rookie numbers to some of you, but I take time to tailor each application to each job. It's just a huge bummer to miss out on these opportunities that are perfect for me, and that I know I will do an amazing job at. Part of why it bothers me so much is it seems like it's so much harder to get into game development. I can hardly find any game development companies that hire early career game developers, it's always like senior 6+ year unreal engine developers, and then they just hire all their new associates from internships and graduate programs, then your opportunity is lost.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR;** Spent a lot of time tailoring applications and networking for 2 dream game development internship/graduate jobs just to fail to horribly worded HackerRank leetcode questions despite knowing I will be capable of doing the job well.",

Some other ideas would be reaching out to agencies/local dev shops with your portfolio and doing some contracting for them. Good luck!",

These tests are not to prove you're more talented or whatever, they're just to prove you've crunched hundreds of these challenges. Like when you studied math in high school, they didn't care if you understood, they just wanted you to solve so many problems you basically know it by hand and just hope you get a very similar problem.",
            "It takes practice to do leetcode problems, even the easy ones.\n\nPretty much every semester the first programming contest at our university goes pretty much the same. 6 easy questions where people who have practiced race to finish all of them under 20 minutes, while the other students are struggling to get 1-2 in the 2 hours timeframe.",

I'm sure you'd be a decent developer for them but so will the other people who got 100% on the questions. There's so many trash developers out there who are lying on their resumes, and there's no real way to make sure that they know how to code without testing them. Basically if you want to work for one of those major companies you need to practice",
            "Bro sorry but tailoring an application isn't gonna get you anywhere further than getting an OA, but I guess you had to learn your lesson the hard way.\n\nRiot Games is probably attracting more potential early career candidates than regular FAANG offerings, we're talking about a game company whose products people of our generations have been literally addicted to for more than a decade now, why do you think they give you a 2 hours OA when a FAANG coding interview is like 45min at best? Because they get a shitton of applicants, and it doesn't matter if you connected with them beforehand, there's gonna be some hundreds of kids somewhere passing the OA with 100%+ no matter how good of a programmer you think you are.\n\nEven if you passed the OA, you put all your eggs in one basket, it's much better to play a number's game and send out a good resume to 200 companies, than spend the same amount fo time to send a perfect resume to 2 companies. Your effort should be spent on interview and OA prep, not resume prep.",

            "Don\u2019t be too salty about the type of questions asked simply because they are not evaluating you against an absolute metric but relatively to others who also took the test.\nSo if you found the questions confusing, chances are others did too, but they just managed to figure it out.\nSo simply just do better next time!",
            "long time hobbyist game developer working as sde here, lots of respect for the personal projects. similar to what everyone else said, you\u2019ll probably want to brush up on reading convoluted LC questions and solving them with focus on time complexities. \n\nwhen i first started applying to positions, i thought that my base knowledge from indie dev (a* path, flood fill, backtracking, etc) would be enough to pass most OAs but boy did I get fucked up. had to take a couple of months to practice neetcode 75/150 before i started getting followups on OAs\n\nthe reality is that most if not all developer jobs at any big company will require passing a LC screen before you get a chance to talk to a person at all. if anything, you can practice LC with game dev applications in mind to motivate you and help stick the concept (ie/ rabbit hare algo for loop checking and breaking out, backtracking for enemy AI decision making, DP for finding optimal move, etc)\n\ngood luck",

Other than this 1000% being a skill issue where you were slower than other candidates that passed the test.\n\n> despite knowing I will be capable of doing the job well.\n\nSure. You and 10000 other candidates. No one cares that you \"know\" you can do the job well. How do they KNOW that you can? You have to show them in some way.\n\nHaving a portfolio or other job experience gives them evidence that you can do well. Failing LC easies gives them evidence you cannot.

You can learn from it, move on, and the next chance you get you'll be ready. \n\nYou'll never really know what went wrongly exactly, but maybe take some notes on your approach alongside the actual implementation and think critically about where you might improve in terms of communication and your strategy etc. \n\nEither way, commiserations and onward and upward.",

I\u2019m doing a remote internship while taking summer classes (yes, it\u2019s a lot of work and I don\u2019t recommend it unless it\u2019s absolutely necessary) and they allow me to split my hours to attend class in the middle of the day. I work 4 hours in the morning, go to class and have an hour lunch break, then do the remaining 4 hours afterwards. It gives me a good break in between while still doing 8 hours. It\u2019s an option if you feel like 8 hours all at once is much, which it can feel like it if you haven\u2019t worked full time before, but after a while you\u2019ll get used to it. They just want to give you the full experience.\n\nAlso, if your company has intern events (mine has plenty) attend those!

This is a combination of lack of skills and experience as well as all the shitty, time consuming but boring work being lumped on you combined with seniors or managers constantly checking up on you to make sure the work looks good, you're learning and that you're actually working. I'm a senior dev with 16 years exp and I'd say for the last 12 years I've generally been left to my own devices because employers trust me to get on with the job. Either through optimization or nature of the work coupled with my skills or experience there hasn't been much work throughout that period that I couldn't do in an hour or less per day... the hard part was more making it look like I was busy which working remote has curbed for me. For about 6 years I ran my own business while being full time employed that I managed to do at my FT job because I had so much free time.",

            "As a professional programmer, I have convinced myself of the concept of \"negative productivity\": when I'm spending one hour writing code (read: bugs) that will take me multiple hours to find and remove.\n\nAs such, I stop coding if my brain isn't up to the task. I plan out peripheral tasks to reduce the risk of bugs, and give myself a break (sometimes an hour or two long) before picking bite-sizes chunks to take on.\n\n8 hours for me includes 2-3 hours of mental recharge. Some people make 8 hours of productivity. I achieve maximal productivity working 4-5 hours a day.",

            "No. And the general consensus here makes evident the fact that the 8 hour work day is obsolete. It was fine for factory workers working 12 hour days in the late 19th century. Now it's 2023. Income disparity has increased. The workforce is more productive but only the rich see significant gains. End the 40 hour work week or pay us more.",

            "Depends on the definition of work. Like literally coding for 8 hours daily? I\u2019m skeptical of anyone who says they do. Also short breaks are normal and expected in any workplace. But most people try to be productive in some capacity for as much of those 8 hours as possible. Take advantage of the opportunity to learn as much as possible!",
            "I'll be honest the main motivator for me doing a degree was purely just a bit of paper to open doors. I've been a dev for 4 years now and a lot of places won't even give you the time of day unless you have a degree.
