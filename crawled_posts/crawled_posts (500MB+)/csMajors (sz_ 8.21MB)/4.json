They had good jobs, but it was because they were rich and/or smart. Not college.\n\nBefore that, it was to 'Get a good factory job, put in your dues, and have a good life'...but then factory work was largely automated and wages went down.\n\nBut college graduates still did better than non-college graduates. And everyone said 'Well, you just need a good major! You can't study art or music, you need STEM'\n\nAnd people flocked to STEM.\n\nBut lots of them couldn't get good jobs. It was tough and competitive because we just didn't have a need for that many workers in lots of STEM. But tech was growing like crazy.\n\nSo then it became 'Well, if you want a good job, learn to code' because coders made a lot and because the market was growing fast.\n\nAnd just like all the other advice, it will end up being poor advice for most people....it's outdated. By the time everyone agrees that X is good, they are really saying that X was good for the people who did it 15 years ago. It's probably bad advice for people starting out now... And at the end of the day, success isn't just about choosing to do the right X. A 'good' salary is always going to be one that is higher than most other salaries. It's not enough to do X, you have to be better than most people also trying to do X if enough people are doing X.\n\nFor better or worse, our society is structured in such a way that most of us won't make a good wage. No matter what we do. Because we define a good job and a good wage relative to other jobs.",
