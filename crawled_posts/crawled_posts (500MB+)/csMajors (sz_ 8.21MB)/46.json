            "Diversity hiring doesn\u2019t exist. Big tech has no hiring quotas, they hire everyone who is qualified. There is no possibility a white man who passes all Amazon tech interviews doesn\u2019t get the job. \n\n\nThe reason there are almost no women/non-Asian POC in big tech is because of they way they do interviews. Generally they do an OA and phone screen round. People who get past this OA in 70-80% of cases are from T25 CS programs, and T25 CS programs are almost entirely comprised of White and Asian men. T25 CS programs are almost entirely white/Asian men because women are encouraged from birth to not pursue stem, and other minorities have been redlined into shitty school districts by racist housing policy. Asians avoided this to large extent because the Asians who immigrated to the US in almost all cases came from elite, highly educated backgrounds within their own countries.\n\nSo basically yes, there are reasons other than \u201cmen are smarter \ud83e\udd2a\ud83e\udd2a\ud83e\udd2a\u201d for why big tech is comprised entirely of men from 2 demographics.",

I guess there's always a small chance they desperately want to work only for that one particular company, where such issue actually exists, but this isn't the norm.",

            "We do not have a 1:1 ratio in terms of men and women in the population. We don't have that perfect split in CS programs. This number has steadily increased over the last 20 years and has resulted in a natural increase in the number of women in the workplace. So how is it possible to achieve that 1:1 ratio in the workplace without discriminating against men? The number of men who are interested in pursuing cs is far greater than the number of women who feel the same. The workplace will not be balanced until we encourage more women to study cs. There are so many international students in this country who fight tooth and nail to immigrate to this country, study and get a job against all odds. Do you see them complaining? If you are not from the US, do you think it is easy to fit in anywhere? The cultural and individual differences in a workplace is a fascinating thing. You don't need 10 slightly different versions of you in the workplace to get along with people and make friends.",
            "Personally, I dislike \"diversity hiring\", for several reasons:\n\n* I believe in raw merit, period. If I fail, I don't blame it on \"diversity hiring\"; I blame myself and use this failure to improve.\n* These programs don't even do the basics properly. For instance, I once looked at a \"diversity scholarship\". The eligibility criteria was so vague - they wanted \"members of underrepresented groups in technology\". What does that even mean? People with disabilities? People of colour? Someone from Mongolia (or a place underrepresented in tech)? Like I actually think some are self-opting out of these things because they wouldn't know if they were eligible.\n* I think they are missing the point. It's not colour that counts. From the ones I've seen, a poor white boy would not be eligible for the majority of these programs (at least in the UK), while a rich, well supported black girl would be. Who needs the support?\n* University admissions (again for the UK) handle this better, as instead of using things like race and stuff, they normally use criteria such as POLAR quintiles (how poor where you live in comparison to the country) and how well your school performed in GCSEs to decide who should be eligible. Is that perfect? No. But I think it handles the situation I gave above better.\n* The presence of these things gets us these arguments - on one side the ones not eligible complains about \"diversity hiring\" - while on the other side, the ones who deserve to get the role being accused of being a \"diversity hire\". It's not good either way.",
            "Personally I think there should only be skill-based hiring. However, more than half of the interns are female at the place I'm interning at. Tbh I didn't even notice until I saw this post, but all of them are more than capable at their positions.",

            "i don\u2019t understand this diversity hiring at all. before you start spam downvoting me because of difference of opinion, id love to understand. if less women choose this field or even engineering in general because they enjoy it less and some other reasons, why are they getting put on a pedastool? since they are way more women teachers than men and more women nurses than men, why dont we have diversity hiring in those areas for men as well?",

            "I do not think it is about employees not hiring women but women not interested in tech I guess, which is sad cause women bring a different perspective to solving problems and design that men do not. In my final year Digital Logic class, there were 3 women out of 250 classmates. At graduation the % of women totaled only 2% of the entire graduating class of 2022. That means out of ~4000 students who graduated only ~80 of them were women and ~3900 were men. One thing I noticed about my female colleagues at the digital logics class was that even though there were just 3 of them, they outperformed almost the entire class, am not saying they were better than everyone solving problems but they got better marks than the rest. When it came to projects and brainstorming ideas, boys came up with the solution way faster(maybe it was a numbers game, more boys = higher chance of getting better ideas) but when it came to putting in the work to study for tests, women were more consistent. There were also classes in my undergrad where there were no girls at all 100- 250 students all were boys",

            "What in the hell could they possibly be looking for in an intern to offer that kind of pay?!? .... wow.",
            "No thanks - never again would I interview with Optiver. I was chased by their recruiters for an entire year before I finally said okay and took the stupid hacker rank test after being told it would solely be used to determine how I think and to shape further discussion. What I ended up getting was a mail that explained I scored too low for a human to even look at my free form section at all, thus they wouldn't be moving forward. Let's look at the FOUR questions on the entire exam that was used to make that determination... Expected right answers have a \\* next to them and my answers are in parentheses. I'm happy to share the entire PDF they sent me as my \"assessment\" along with a forwarded copy of the mail that they explained those four questions resulted in them not assigning a human to review the rest.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \nQuestion 1: Multi-Threading...  \nAlways makes a program run fasterMakes a program easier to debug  \n(\\* Can help to take advantage of multi-CPU architecture)  \n\\*Can help to make a GUI more responsive  \nExplanation: I failed this question because I didn't choose \"Can help to make a GUI more responsive.\" Firstly, I'm not a GUI developer - at all. Secondly, go tell a Python developer that using threads will enhance the performance of his PyQt GUI... Third, this is so specific to implementation and most GUI's will not have any advantage from introducing threading.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \nQuestion 2: You have a single-threaded algorithm running on an Intel Core i7 3.10Ghz / 4.10 GHz (turbo), 4 cores/8 threads. What would help optimize the speed of this algorithm?  \n\\*Switch off as many cores as possible  \n(\\*Switch off hyper threading)  \nSwitch off CPU core isolation  \n(\\*Switch off power saving)  \nExplanation: This was marked as wrong because I didn't select \"switch off as many cores as possible,\" which is purely an implementation-specific answer. . I manage a build that has literally 40+ scripts which launch in a single go every one hour on the dot that maintain various aspects of the OS and configuration management in a highly regulated environment. Flat out disabling all other cores in on the box other than the ones specific applications are using would result in those administrative tasks potentially landing on the core that latency critical apps are on and taking time away from them on the scheduler. Sure, we can use CPU isolation, nohz\\_full and task pinning - that's a given. But then the question of what cores those non-application-specific threads are going to run on arises. However, you\u2019ll notice my statement here is absolutely use-case-specific, as was the expected answers. I won't even get started on how memory interleave being enabled or disabled (NUMA for the simpletons who made the test) would potentially change the field here as well.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \nQuestion 4: You want to copy a complete home directory from one Linux machine to another. What commands could you use to do so? Note there are no mounts from one machine to another.  \nxcopy  \ncp  \n\\*rsync  \n(\\*scp)  \nExplanation: I got this marked as wrong because I chose only scp and not rsync. There's a reason for that, though. While not every box (including my own) will have rsync on them - show me a host that has OpenSSH but no scp...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \nQuestion 5: UDP Datagrams...There are two computers both connected to the same Ethernet switch, one is sending UDP datagrams with an incrementing sequence number and the other is receiving them. The receiving application's logs show not all datagrams are being received (but most are). What are possible causes?  \n(The Ethernet switch is delivering packets in a different order)  \n(\\*The sending application is trying to send at a rate higher than the network can handle)  \n(\\*The receive application is taking too much time processing datagrams)  \nThe operating system versions on the two computers are incompatible  \nExplanation: This was marked wrong because I chose \"The ethernet switch is delivering packets in a different order,\" aka out of order packets. While the question details that \"one is sending UDP datagrams with an incrementing sequence number\" - UDP does not have sequence numbers, retransmissions or any other verifications implemented at a protocol level. This is entirely up to the application to implement these specifics. If sequencing is implemented, what the application does with it and how it uses that sequencing is entirely implementation-specific. And I have personally tracked down and identified problems with data gaps in applications because despite having implemented sequencing at the application layer, a developer chose to discard entire transmissions if the sequencing was determined to be out of order. Don't even get me started on the crazy things I've seen developers do with where and how they decided to implement their own timestamps on multicast messages.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \nSo, the above is what resulted in me receiving a response indicating that they would not proceed further with discussions with me nor would anyone review the part of that ridiculous pre-screening \"test\" that took the absolute most time-investment, the free-form sections. I took the time to spend hours away from my family time to complete this garbage on the understanding that it would be used as a discussion point \"to understand how \\[I\\] think\" - and instead, I got handed a numerical score showing that I only scored 33 of 165 possible points and thus I'm too technically inept to have anyone speak to me. And then I'm also told good luck in my search... A search I wasn't embarking on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \nThis gives me the impression that their hiring managers have far more important things to do than their job of identifying talent, and have instead chosen to offload that responsibility to algorithmic candidate selection. I wouldn't be surprised if they eventually just start having people interview with ChatGPT.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \nThank you, Optiver, for wasting both of our time - multiple times. It won't happen again.",

Some of the friends I made were going into the office on Saturday AND Sunday. I really didn\u2019t want work to comprise of 80% of my waking hours so I just phoned it in instead of burning out completely for the last couple weeks. I didn\u2019t get a return offer and neither did any of the others that I knew of, which was pretty shitty in my opinion.\n\nI know things aren\u2019t amazing in the tech industry but this gave me a bad impression of FAANG, I didn\u2019t even bother asking for an internship return offer lmfao.

I am either really late applying for a job posting or have to manually sort through postings to see what I actually want to apply to.\n\nSo this summer I've been working on a project to solve these issues with the following features:\n\n1. Get notified RIGHT AWAY when there's a new internship/new grad posting\n2. Have top internship/new grad postings all in one place where you can easily sort through and filter to find exactly what you're looking for\n3. Integrated salary data to job postings, so you know exactly what they pay!\n\nIf you're interested, please check out the site [sweintern.com](https://sweintern.com/)!\n\nThe job postings are collected from [Pitt CSC](https://github.com/pittcsc/Summer2024-Internships) and [ReaVNail](https://github.com/ReaVNaiL/New-Grad-2024) \\- so if you have any new job postings you find, please add them there and contribute to the community!\n\nThis was a fun personal project I've been working on for the past month and would love to hear your feedback / what yall think of it! \n\nPS I hope yall like the UI, it took forever to make \ud83e\udd72",

It's one thing for people to be obsessed with leetcode for the companies where it's actually necessary, that's a natural and mostly unavoidable outcome given the self-selection in the subreddit's demographics -- but it's another thing to spread misinformation that you need to grind eternally for *any* internship.\n\nAnd keep the reports coming of anyone doing the above, or otherwise actively gatekeeping or insulting others.\n\nedit: it's also worth noting that, for the purposes of internship attainability, [the OP has had three coding internships before this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/pjp3pt/how_many_internships_should_i_have_as_a_new_grad), which by itself is generally going to be a big boost. I point this out because the vibe in the post seems to be \"getting an internship isn't that hard\", and while they may well be true, I don't think you can necessarily use this particular case as an example of that when they have so much previous internship experience.\n\nHonestly, I feel like OP should've disclosed that in their post.",

Apply apply apply, grind leetcode if you feel it helps you, go to career fairs and hand out your resume like a mad-person. My internship was from making a good impression with folks from a local software company at a career fair on campus. My first (and only, so far) post graduation job (which took six months of full time effort to get, by the way) was literally a posting I came across on LinkedIn and applied to. No networking was involved, I never once made leetcoffee, there were not multiple rounds of interviews. Sometimes even CS jobs have a more traditional apply, in-person interview (mine was with 3 people), phone call: \"We'd like to offer you a job!\" structure. Just because all anyone ever talks about on this and the CSCQ subreddits is the hyper intense FAANG style interview doesn't mean everywhere is like that.
