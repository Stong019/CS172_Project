            "It is a sad thing indeed. \n\nAsians have to score much higher compared to other races in order to get admitted to US universities. Their extracurricular activities and other things must also be better.\n\nSadly the majority of US universities treat Asian applicants and students as if they are not human being. Meanwhile, blacks, whites, and Latinos are far more likely to get admitted for the same portfolio. Just because we are the more accomplished race doesn't mean that we should be excluded and face a higher bar - it is simply racism and it is what makes American education a complete shithole.\n\nAlso before any bigots saying that Asian have higher income and all that - let me tell you this. We work twice as hard as other people, our culture does not permit failure or slacking off, we avoid politics and spend much more time to work and study than any other race. And still we are discriminated upon by college admission and workplace hiring. The statistics you see arent a representation of how many talented Asians are there. A study shows that if Affirmative action was not included, 43% of Harvard would be Asian rather than a merely 24%.

And to be honest a lot of those jobs can be done only with bootcamp skills, which is why they are still getting hired.

        "selftext": "Did 500+ LeetCode questions, created Blind 75, and interviewed hundreds of candidates. Frankly speaking, I dislike LeetCode, but the rules aren't set by us and the best we can do is to be better at this stupid game together.\n\nHence here are some tips for you.\n\n1. Revise your CS fundamentals before your start LeetCoding. You don't have to spend that much time studying, but you need to know the advantages of each data structure and when to use which for the question.\n\n2. The average question difficulty you'll get is Medium. Start with Easy questions, do more of them, move on to Medium questions. You probably won't be asked Hard questions in real interviews but you should do some famous Hard questions like Word ladder, serialize/deserialize Binary tree and trapping rain water. You should not be practicing only Easy questions.\n\n3. LeetCode is not fully representative of real interviews. In real interviews, you don't get long descriptions nor do you get so many test cases. Questions in interviews are intentionally vague and underspecified, you have to clarify the requirements. You will also not be given input ranges during interviews.\n\n4. To better simulate interview conditions, come up with a solution in your mind and be sure of the time and space complexity before you start to code. Trial and error-ing during the interview is not seen as a positive signal. As a good habit I write the time and space complexity of my solution as a comment above my solution.\n\n5. If you find yourself stuck after half an hour on a question. Determine if you are close enough to cracking it. If you're close, try for a while longer. Otherwise read the solutions and move on. Learn the technique that was crucial to solving the question and internalize it. Revisit in a few day's time and try to solve it without referring to the answer this time. LeetCode also shows you similar questions for a problem. To test if you have understood the concepts, try the similar questions and see if you can solve them.\n\n6. You might not get to run your code during interviews. Interviewers aren't just evaluating how correct your code is, the signals you exhibit during the process matters as well. You can end up failing even though you wrote correct code but it's messy and not readable. You can also end up passing even if your code had a minor mistake but your code is super clean and well-structured. Getting an Accepted doesn't mean you did well if you only got it on your tenth attempt. Before hitting the submit button, scrutinize your solution hard. Come up with test cases, standard ones, edge cases, think whether your code will pass those cases. You can run your code against your own test cases, it's still better than hitting the submit button. Just note that you might not get to do that during interviews.\n\n7. Some topics are more important than the others. DFS, BFS, binary search, trees, graphs are the most important and common ones. If you're going for Google, practice DP. If you suck at DP like me, at least be good at backtracking with memoization.\n\n8. The chosen language doesn't matter as much as your mastery of the language. You don't have to pick up Python just because it's the best language for interviews. But if you have enough time (more than two months), it might be worth doing so.\n\n\n9. You don't need to practice too many questions. 100-200 is sufficient for most. After a while, the questions are variations of previous questions and are based off the same patterns. The returns on practicing above 300 questions is marginal at best. The full list of 169 questions in Grind 75 (https://grind75.com) is 90% of what you need.\n\n10. LeetCoding is a marathon, not a sprint. If you start too early, you run out of steam. Start too late and there's not enough time for spaced repetition to take effect. Recommend starting a few months in advance and spending 1hr a day doing a few questions per day. You should be in top shape when it's time for interviews. If you've completed all recommended practice questions, do the weekly contests. If you can solve at least 3 of them, you should be ready for interviews.\n\n11. You might never feel ready for interviews and that's perfectly normal. Interviewing is a numbers game. Interview performance is a function of luck and preparation. The more you prepare, the \"luckier\" you get. You will fail some and you will pass some. You just need to pass one.\n\nAll the best and lemme know in the comments if you have any questions!",

            "Great advice. I\u2019ve been using your site and Neetcode to practice Leetcode and I have definitely seen progress in my Leetcoding ability.\n\nI saw you ask above how your site compares to Neetcode. For me personally, I liked how Neetcode\u2019s 150 was sorted by pattern and popularity. The fact that he also provides a youtube explanation along with a solution for EVERY question is a huge help as well. \n\nGrind 75 is a fantastic site though! Just wish there was more \u201chelp\u201d along with the questions listed. It feels like Grind 75 already assumes you understand how to do the questions while Neetcode is more focused on actually *teaching* the questions (which is more helpful for me). Really appreciate again what you\u2019re providing to everyone!",
            "This is really helpful, thanks",
            ">If you start too early, you run out of steam\n\nI do not agree, with one caveat. Starting LeetCode without having taken a data structures and algorithms module could possibly be frustrating as the foundation would be missing.\n\nOtherwise, I don't think there is a \"too early\" time if you do, say, a question a day (like doing the daily challenges). As someone might say: \"a LeetCode a day keeps rejections away\". The key point is that time is a double-edged sword - you can choose it to be an ally or a foe.",

            "First off, thank you for coming up with the list. I recently got a couple of offers and the blind75 def played a huge role. \n\nTo add on, a thing I find useful during interviews is documenting assumptions, approach, complexities as a comment. Helps me keep things clear and the interviewer is also free to read it in case they get lost/miss something. \n\nAnother thing I'd say is that most often questions have some insight that you need to figure out to solve it in an optimal way. First principles is a great mental model to arrive at this, it's also a mental model that helps you become a great problem solver in the long run.\n\nI love the blind75 list cause it helps nail down the basic building blocks eg. BFS/DFS for graphs etc. Once you got these under your belt everything else just starts to fall into place.",

We found the bug based on that insight and everybody clapped. No, seriously (not the clapping part, but theoretical CS knowledge saving the day), it happened, it was great, it made it feel worthwhile to pursue my interest in CS. However it happened half a decade ago and it's still the one story I can trot out.\n\nIn my experience this kind of thing happens way less often to the average developer than you'd think.\n\nWe are way, way, waaaaay overteaching CS theory to people who have no use for it and could have make a great developer without it, but we successfully gatekept them out by flunking them in school or made them give up because \"programming is hard\".\n\nCS the science is hard.

I hope you\u2019re proud.\n\nBut what exactly is the goal of your post? Do you want to make sure people take a theory of computation class? Do you want people to become experts in proving theoretical problems? Do you want people to refresh their proofing abilities regularly? Your intention is really unclear and my current conclusion is that somebody triggered you by saying math / theory is bs and useless for the career (assumption based off some of your..less than graceful replies)\n\nI have bad news. Often-times, they\u2019re right. These things appear in useful crumbs throughout people\u2019s careers, but rarely (and i mean very rarely) will someone come across problems that require as rigorous formal analysis as what you went through. Lots of the time, it\u2019s enough to have experience / intuition for when more careful approaches / learning is needed. The \u201ctheoretical cs fundamentals\u201d aren\u2019t always necessary to know and convince others that something isn\u2019t fitting. It\u2019s a huge leap to assume that other engineers without that formal education would have wasted their time on an unsolvable problem. \n\nWill the people who neglect that foundation create groundbreaking tech and patents that do the impossible or save millions/billions of dollars in a \u201chero\u201d moment that required an intense proof (or disproof)? Maybe not, but honestly, that\u2019s a-okay with most engineers.\n\nI also don\u2019t think I should need to say this, but learning something once isn\u2019t enough. You have a PhD. You did a lot of research-oriented work over a long period of time, and likely wrote several proofs as part of your program / research. You may recognize problems requiring a more formal approach easier than someone who just took a couple of classes in their undergrad and then never needed to use it until 15 years later. So i guess this brings me back to the first questions \u2014 what is your point, and what is your motivation? Your anecdote is an outlier in the grand scheme of things and can\u2019t really be generalized in modern software engineering. Most people don\u2019t need to know that stuff / will never need to know that stuff and even if they could (not commenting on whether they should), they probably don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth the effort to save an engineering team one month of work one time in their lifetime career as opposed to an elective that will give them an edge in the currently terrible market, or a niche field (robotics, security etc)",

Lately I sometimes just  dream of studying my textbooks but without a class to worry about and anyone telling me maybe I'm too slow or am not cut out for CS when I even slightly go over the expected one on one teaching time for a student. \n\nMainly it's been my realization that the preformance pressure despite the complexity of the theory never ends has made me even consider that maybe I'm happier with mathematics and CS  theory being my hobby, but I haven't had anyone to talk to about this. \n\nI find myself enjoying the theory but I often do not enjoy navigating theory within an institution, I can get frustrated to tears when the assigned textbook doesn't come with an answer key, the professor says they won't help me with the HW problems fully yet they are different than the lectures yet the textbook is not being followed in the lecture, basically I've just been facing burnout since when dealing with good professors at best I feel like a hamster on a wheel just working towards a good grade without the time to understand the material, just \"preform well\", and in the worse case scenario with a professor who has a reputation I am completely floundering. \n\nI realized that working as a professional, I'll always be forced into a mold and will never really be accommodated.

It did help that I had reasonably strong foundations from my school's data structures course so I wasn't learning anything from scratch. \n\nI watched the videos, wrote out stuff on paper, and made sure I could explain the solution to myself from scratch and justify each and every line of code. ChatGPT was so, so helpful in this regard. If I ever didn't understand something, I could paste that chunk of the solution (with some context) and ask it all the dumb questions I wanted to ask, and it worked like a charm.\n\nThat said, I had my tech screen today, and *I killed it*. I got a leetcode medium (dp problem) and I got so lucky - it was something that I'd gone through 4 days ago, and repeated yesterday night to make sure I didn't just memorize the solution. The interviewer basically said I'll be moving onto the next round(s) today itself. \n\nThis was a huge wake up call, guys.

How much data are you using per day/per month? Might help with decision making later.\n\n3. Draw a basic design. Key word: *basic*. Client, Server, APIs, DB. After listing out what services you might have, talk about the APIs and what they might look like and then the DB choice you would make based on situation (SQL vs NOSQL, MySQL vs PostgreSQL, etc). You should spend time building a schema of sorts, to explain how you will tackle the functional requirements in tandem with your APIs to utilize your new schema.\n\n4. Identify bottlenecks and start to scale your design - add caching, a load balancer, CDN, talk about how read replicas or master-slave could help your particular situation. Simple stuff that doesn't require a lot of studying to explain why it's good will be huge for entry-level. Highly recommend being able to explain what the above listed are, and why the tradeoffs make it worth implementing. \n\nRemember to keep an open mind about the problem - at the end of the day you want to treat it like a paired exercise and you can always bounce ideas off of your interviewer. Try not to bring up something that you don't know just because you saw it in a video or something. Be prepared to get grilled about any choice you make. The biggest key about these interviews is being able to discuss pros and cons of approaches. Good luck!",

For example, there is a lot of gatekeeping others into joining the industry or judging how they did it. Why?!

A lot of thing had to be done manually. Boilerplate was more than actual code.  It was not cool and hip. The people working in this sector were often looked down (especially by women) because they often don't make that much money (they make good money, but not as much as today), they don't know how to dress, often they are bullied by their coworkers, and looked down by other department, and taken advantages of by others.\n\nAnd I tell you they harbor a lot of resentment toward society. Like a lot. And resentment took on another form called ... \"elitism\". In their eyes, the rest of the worlds is idiots because the rest of the world don't understand their \"magic\" of their code. They are wizards and shit. They even get together, forming forums, and jerk each other off. Damn gross, the early tech crowd was despicable I tell you.\n\nThen BOOM, the new tech wave came, we now have services like aws, google cloud, azure, no one touch the hardware no more. The screen is LCD, flat, thin and slick. Software UI is all colorful with animation blinking here and there. An office of a tech worker is reduced to just a table and a slicky laptop. Often that's a macbook, because macs are a status symbol, and the tech workers after decades of resentment want to show the world that they are the shit, can afford the most expensive shit, although mac OS is not the best for software development, linux is better, but you're free to pick your poison.\n\nSo the IT crowd is hip and cool now and they are also rich, and just get richer by the day. Not only that, all the big boy famous billionaires are from the IT crow. Combine a mentality of a spoiled child + a adult child + a bullied child + pathetic mindset and often pathetic bodies + a lot money. You get what you called \"elitism\". In truth, it's just weak people swinging their mental problem from one extreme to another.\n\nSource: I am a software developer.",

I saw many people who don't wanna commute purely because don't wanna spend time for commuting though. And companies I know, gave a free Orca card to engineers.",

Amazon and Msft won those contracts and it greatly helped expand their cloud business. \n\nThey built this culture of coddling employees and now whenever they dont its news. At any other tech company this would be a non event. \n\nIf the employee didn't want to work for on the project, great don't, find a new role or quit.",

            "Makes sense... common sense even.  The guy identified himself as a Google engineer and Google doesn't want to be associated with that and didn't give him permission to drag their company into it.  Most companies will fire anyone if they drag the company into negative press like this guy did.  Regardless of what you're protesting, don't bring your employer/company into it unless you already have their permission and full support behind what you're protesting.  It's absurd that he mentioned Google at all.  He was trying to leverage the company's clout for his own political aspirations without permission, not ok behavior.",
