I\u2019ve always known I\u2019m more accomplished than the average cs student and my resume speaks for itself. However, reading that commenter\u2019s posts in the thread sparked something inside me for some reason. \n\nI realized that if people on here are willing to dismiss jameslyonsswe as a diversity hire, it\u2019s a symptom of a much deeper issue of blatant racism and hatred. At this point you must just view all black people as inherently inferior in order to justify that mentality and I would just like to say in the most honest way possible that there is something deeply wrong with you. The black people in tech that you come across are not the problem, you are. You\u2019re a racist. \n\nSo if you would like to continue living that way, good luck and enjoy being broke and bitter &amp;lt;3. \n\nIf not, here\u2019s a few questions to ask yourself in order to figure out whether someone\u2019s a diversity hire or if you\u2019re just a bigot (it\u2019s most likely the latter) : \n\n- If their race, gender, sexuality were switched to straight white/asian male (i\u2019m adding asian men to this because asian men make up a large portion of tech workers relative to their population in western countries. i\u2019m not dismissing all the hardships and discrimination faced by the asian community. I will always be an ally to asians), would  they still seem like a diversity hire?\n\n- Are there any prejudices you might have about an element of that person\u2019s identity? \n\n- Do you have any role models with a similar identity to that person? If not, is there a reason? (are you likely to dismiss everyone with a similar background to this person as unqualified?)\n\n- Do you know enough about them and they\u2019re background and accomplishment to even make an accurate assessment? (the answers is probably no). \n\nIf you answered yes to one or more of the questions above you probably have an issue. \n\nIt\u2019s 2022 guys, this type of thinking is frankly ridiculous and i\u2019m especially disappointed to see so many asian guys sharing the same mentality. As fellow minorities in western countries we share an understanding of what it\u2019s like to be discriminated against and shouldn\u2019t perpetuate that.\n\n\nEdit: Wow, what an experience. I\u2019ve never had a post this \u201ccontroversial\u201d blow up like this. Here are some takeaways i got. \n\n- A lot of people on this community are kinda dumb. Judging from the really immature or blatantly irrelevant responses i got I would say their reading comprehension and argumentative skills could definitely be improved. But alas, it\u2019s impossible to win an argument with a stupid person, so i had to give up in those instances. \n\n- The tension between black and asian students is definitely a delicate matter. I noticed a lot of the comments I made in defence of black students were automatically seen as disses towards asian students. I\u2019m not sure why that was but I did find that interesting. however, there was no point in which i was trying to say anything offensive towards asians. \n\n- I stand by everything in my original post and i think the reception of this post is reflective of the dissonance a lot of non-minority CS students have about Affirmative Action and American race relations as a whole. Educate yourselves and stop being a piece of shit towards others : )\n\n\nEdit 2: Thanks to everyone who\u2019s been PMing me. That\u2019s really sweet but I just wanted to say it\u2019s completely fine. Like I\u2019m not really taking any of the negative comments seriously so don\u2019t worry! I was also mostly expecting this reaction to my post based off other comments in this community.\n\nEdit 3: Holy shit, jameslyonswe made a tiktok about this!!",

            "Asian checking in here. Anyone who thinks diversity hires are taking all the jobs now needs to look at the *actual stats* companies post annually about hiring (the detailed packets, small text at the back, not some headline/pretty chart). Take Google for example, last I checked going from 2014 to 2019 *NEW* Black technical hires went from like 2% to 3% of all new tech hires. Overall workforce representation barely moved. Asians jumped up from like ~36% to ~50% of new tech hires.\n\nJust search up \u201c___ Company Annual Hiring / Diversity Report\u201d. A lot of companies don\u2019t even post because it doesn\u2019t look favourable / doesn\u2019t align with all their talk about DEI.\n\nPeople who are frustrated, I understand job hunting can be extremely demoralizing, especially when you\u2019re looking at your very first internship while in college.

            "I have a black friend who is a software engineer. He got an internship at Microsoft freshman year and he got in through one of those minority focused recruiting programs. \n\nNow you could argue that gives him an unfair advantage or whatever, but when he actually started the internship a lot of his coworkers were openly racist to him. His team lead mismanaged their project and then put all the blame on him at the end of the internship. He got a return offer but ended up declining it due to how he was treated while working there.  \n\nNow he is searching for a full time job, and despite having a Microsoft internship on his resume, a stellar GPA, a good college, and other relevant experience, he is having trouble getting a job or interviews. He applied at my company and didn\u2019t get hired, and I am a worse applicant than him in basically every way. \n\nI\u2019ve seen his resume, it\u2019s good. He\u2019s very sociable and confident and would do extremely well in behavioral interview. I can only think of one reason why he is being given the cold shoulder a lot of the time and I think you know what it is. \n\nWhen people talk about these diversity programs, they seem to forget that they exist to OFFSET the bias that exists in the tech industry. It isn\u2019t an advantage, it is to offset a disadvantage. Racism is alive and well in tech.\n\nEdit: thanks to everyone reaching out with job leads!

            "I don't think it's fair to tell anyone they are a diversity hire because there are so many factors at play other than race.\n\nHowever, if any claim is being made it is that some races can are put to a lower bar. At Harvard, for example, the average SAT of admitted African Americans is 1420 while 1550 for asians. (source:[https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/10/22/asian-american-admit-sat-scores](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/10/22/asian-american-admit-sat-scores)/). This is similar for some other colleges, and for STEP, FBU, Dropbox Launch, Uber STAR, and explore, those intern classes are 70%+ minority.\n\nIn many cases, some of these people would have accomplished those things regardless of their race. But the data says they are put to a lower bar, that's it. I hope this didn't come off as racist. In fact, I think a lower bar would be justified in cases where one had more hardships to overcome than the other.",
            ">a mixture of racism and jealousy\n\nSomething I learned being a CS student is most people are just never going to clap for you. Everyone here is just insecure, desperate to get theirs and looking out solely for #1. People who are more accomplished or have the things they're obsessed with (like a FNG role) are an identity/security threat so their lizard brain will try to find any cope it can come up with to not feel inferior and justify why that person doesn't actually deserve that (\"that person is just a diversity hire\"). The fact of the matter is, student communities are inherently toxic through a mix of immaturity, desperation and having an uncertain place in the world and everyone trying to claw their way towards getting theirs with a lot of competition.\n\nScreaming about how women and minorities have it easier just seems like a larval stage a lot of these dudes go through when they're brand new to CS and have put in 10 apps without success. The only solution I've ever found to this is to shut it off and go on being successful. What does NASA Stanford Google guy have to be mad about? Nothing. You don't need the approval of a bunch of whos on Reddit. The people who are actually qualified and have the power to determine who deserves those opportunities said yes.\n\nNone of this is really related to your points about racism but personally I'm just really done with the opinions of social media whos about who deserves what. Sorry whos, Google and NASA said yes. Die mad about it.",

            "I feel like you're entire post is a strawman argument. People would be wrong to say that jameslyonsswe in particular is a diversity hire because he clearly is not. His achievements stand up on their own and he wouldn't need his \"diverse\" identity to give him a leg up over others, but many people clearly do. If you take a sample of people on LinkedIn that have gotten prestigious SWE jobs at non-trading firms, you'll find that on average, underrepresented minorities have far fewer achievements as opposed to non-urms in terms of things you can do without any internships (personal projects, GPA, CS research, programming contests, etc.). If you look at trading firms, you will see that they hire almost no underrepresented minorities, and the ones they do hire are as smart or smarter than the rest. This would either indicate that trading firms are racist, or that these SWE companies are practicing diversity hiring for their entry-level roles and some people really are there because of their ethnic background. I'm on your side though. It is a shame that the image of smart individuals gets ruined by diversity hiring practices because they happen to be a URM.\n\nEdit:\n\nI'm an Asian male. I don't think I'm biased by jealousy as I have found a decent amount of success with my internship and full-time job applications. I just think that it'd be wrong to say that \"diversity hires\", i.e. people who wouldn't have made it to their position with the same family financial background + qualifications if they weren't a race that is considered underrepresented in tech, aren't prevalent.",

If that meant the whole staff ended up mostly or fully of one race you can rest assure that it wasn\u2019t racist and just the best candidates.\n\nHowever, systematic racism is still a huge problem wether people like to admit it or not. An office full of white guys might not have all been the most qualified because they passed up on some intelligent colored people. The whole point of diversity hire is to combat this ingrained systematic racism. Not all companies are racist, some do hire fairly and theoretically wouldn\u2019t need a diversity program. But unfortunately there is no what to prove that in today\u2019s world.\n\nAs morbid as it sounds though, I do think it\u2019ll get better once the boomer generation is gone.

It most certainly can and frequently does stem from bigotry, but those people\u2019s thought processes can be more complicated than that.\n\nSource: am white straight man, once felt that way, realized that I\u2019m wrong.\n\n\n\nEdit: I\u2019m actually going to clarify why I felt how felt and why I realized it was wrong before I\u2019m seen as a bigot.\n\nI\u2019m white, but I grew up in a very liberal area, with a liberal family. There are people of all races that are in my family. Based on my circumstances, I had never witnessed racism against non-whites in any substantial way. \n\nI dated a black girl who lived in a poor area in the city (I lived here myself at one point). Extreme racial prejudice is a part of very recent history, and we are now in a time period of recovery. A black man and woman in the 20s were not given the same opportunities, and as a result, 100 years later, many families are stuck in poverty. The girl I dated believed she couldn\u2019t afford college, and was planning to be a waitress for her entire life. I personally never saw me \u201cnot being able to afford it\u201d because I was willing to take out loans (even though we made no more money than her family did). This is the biggest reason why colleges are so overwhelmingly white.\n\nIn college I heard about the issue of diversity in college, and I believed it was an issue, but I did not have first hand exposure to racism. \n\nWhat I realized after my first internship in a republican area is that racism is still very real. \n\nThis was my realization:\n\n* it\u2019s true that sometimes a recruiter may be tempted to choose a black woman over a white man who is equally qualified sometimes, for the sake of improving their numbers.\n\n* it\u2019s more likely that both candidates would get an interview and they would choose the one they vibe with the most.\n\n* it\u2019s also true that sometimes a recruiter might be less tempted to choose the black woman over a white man based in internal prejudice.",
            "Your title says it all: \"No they're not a diversity hire, you're just a racist\". Sadly true. \nThen, alongside the seen large number of people who absolutely lack basic reading or comprehension skills (as you pointed out in your edit in response to yet more dumbf\u2606ckery) it becomes glaringly clear that we are indeed still living in a society where our fellow human citizens actually believe that they are superior. Pathetically true. \nIf you or someone you know thinks this way, it's a case of racism, yes. But also something else which goes too often missed and is not spoken of nearly enough. And that is both the sheer stupidity and deep mental illness  one must have to truly believe such a nonsensical notion of being in any way \"superior\" to others based on being born. \nI understand environmental factors, that racism and bigotry are taught. However, that is simply not an excuse. I grew up with racism being shoved down my throat; Everywhere I went from School to Church.  Everyone I knew from my own beloved Family members to friends and neighbors. \nBut even at a young age I knew that it wasn't right. It felt off, not okay. I dreaded the rhetoric and in listening to it I wanted the floor to swallow me up. Even at 5 years old I knew that the Adult's jokes were cruel. I Loved my family. I adored my Grandmother. But I still distinctly remember the emotional and physical discomfort whenever talk of other people, people we didn't even know, were being labeled, or joked about, or the ludacris \"lessons\" aka warnings I'd receive.\nI always felt an unsettling icky knot in my stomach, a lump in my throat, my heart would suddenly feel too heavy for my body.  \nAnd as I grew, so did my mind. And my friend circle. And my life experiences; Getting out of that town, moving to bigger cities, traveling, learning and adapting to various cultures. Living.\nIf I had stayed in that town I would have gone crazy with boredom, but not crazy enough to become a Racist A-hole. In short, there is no excuse. ZERO excuse to be an idiot who wants to be superior. GTFO of here with all that.",
            "Morgan Freeman in an interview rightly said that racism starts with people referring each other as White/black man.\n\nThat's absolutely true. I'm not from the US but I've always wondered why it is such a norm to specifically mention someone as black or white? If I were a black person, I would not like people calling me black - not in a derogatory sense and not in an acceptable way. Adding black, white, asian etc., forcefully puts you under a tag which good people may avoid but racists may end up abusing. So why don't we just get rid of those tags? If someone specifically asks which ethnicity a person belongs to, then we can mention that.\n\nAnd regarding the diversity hiring, I feel it's not how it should be. People should be educated with all the privileges given if required. But it should always be based on need rather than race. There might be a white person sleeping on the streets who would want his kids to study, this person is more deserving to get any help rather than a black kid staying in a healthy neighborhood. Hiring should always be based on merit which will negate all the possibilities of 'unfair' hiring as some would feel. Due to this, even the deserving candidates would have to carry around their resume to prove their worth every time. Diversity hiring is just a thing to increase inclusivity but it all comes down to racism which starts with tagging people with black/white/asian labels.",

            "While I agree with most of your points and I do think that a lot of people calling others diversity hires are mostly a result of jealousy, but what the industry and quite frankly institutions are doing are not exactly helping with that aspect. \n\nI think most ppl who get hired are most definitely qualified or appear qualified for the job, not because of their race and gender. However, it is worth noting that minorities (except asian ofc) are given extra hiring opportunities. So there are DIVERSITY HIRING OPPORTUNITIES, but not much diversity hires. You will see a lot of intern programs that outright say it is for colored minorities, etc. Career fairs with FAANGs that only black, latino or specific genders can attend. \n\nWhether that exactly is fair or not becomes a personal opinion. I personally believe extra opportunities should be only given to those from harsh backgrounds, such as low income, single parenthood and first gen college students (which most African Americans, and colored minorities do fall into those category). Giving extra opportunity just because of one\u2019s color or gender is not fair as the example you have said, someone could have already achieved a lot, such as going to Stanford or coming from a wealthy background even tho they appear to be a colored person. This actually not only introduces inequality, but hurts minorities who truly need help. If you look at Minorities at Ivy Leagues, a lot of them are from wealthy families. The same happens with the intern programs. But ofc, how you view these opportunities are up to you. \n\nBut I will make a final note. Calling someone a diversity hire without any basis, is absolutely racist. But whether one views the extra opportunities such as the ones I mentioned given to minorities are fair, is a whole different story. Plz do not confuse the two, and the latter, whether you think extra opportunities given is fair or not, should not be viewed as racist opinions.",

            "It is worth mentioning here that black job-seekers have markedly different job networks than white job-seekers. [Pedulla & Pager 2019](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0003122419883255) analyze racial differences in job *network access* (the leads that job-seekers receive through their social networks) and *network returns* (the benefits that job-seekers gain by leveraging information in their social networks). The study finds that black job-seekers experience significantly fewer *network returns*, meaning that even though white and black job-seekers use their social networks to find jobs at equal rates, the social networks of black job-seekers are less effective in assisting them to find jobs. One limitation of this study, however, is that it is not specific to the tech industry, and the results may not generalize.   \n\n\nGiven the history of segregation in the United States, it is not surprising that black and white job networks differ in their effectiveness. Furthermore, a [report](https://www.payscale.com/compensation-trends/referrals-hurt-diversity/) from PayScale found that referral processes disproportionately benefit white men (likely driven by the social network effects mentioned above). The report states, \"If you have 100 referred employees, 44 of them will be white males, 22 will be white females, 18 will be minority males and only 16 will be women of color, holding constant industry, location and other relevant variables.\" Referrals are a crucial component of many tech companies' hiring processes, and companies should consider either eliminating or restructuring their referral processes to encourage greater diversity among applicants.   \n\n\nLastly, there is some evidence to indicate racial and gender bias in hiring in the STEM field. Specifically, [Eaton et al 2020](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-019-01052-w) finds \"Faculty in physics exhibited a gender bias favoring the male candidates as more competent and more hirable than the otherwise identical female candidates. Further, physics faculty rated Asian and White candidates as more competent and hirable than Black and Latinx candidates, while those in biology rated Asian candidates as more competent and hirable than Black candidates, and as more hireable than Latinx candidates.\" However, this study focuses on slightly-above-average candidates but other [research](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/17/5360) finds that gender bias favors females when examining exceptionally well-qualified candidates. Additionally, this study was conducted in the context of academic research, and it is possible that the findings do not generalize to an industry-focused context.   \n\n\nI have seen several comments which argue that programs meant to prioritize underrepresented students (i.e. Microsoft Explore, Facebook University, Google STEP) unfairly lead to hiring decisions on the basis of race rather than merit, fueling the \"diversity hire\" narrative. There are 3 points worth highlighting here.   \n\n\nFirst, if it is your belief that applicants ought to be hired on the basis of individual merit rather than group membership in a particular race, it would still be highly inappropriate to participate in mocking others as \"diversity hires\" given that you know nothing about their performance in job interviews that led them to be hired in the first place. If it is wrong to use race to hire someone, it is equivalently wrong to use race to denigrate someone when you do not actually know whether their race played a role in their hiring decision.   \n\n\nSecond, I believe the morally appropriate compromise (that balances individual merit with the general desire to increase diversity within tech) is to utilize first-generation low-income (FGLI) status as a condition to enter such diversity-oriented programs (i.e. Microsoft Explore). FGLI is racially neutral but will disproportionately benefit members of racial minority groups simply by virtue of the fact that a [greater percentage](https://firstgen.naspa.org/files/dmfile/FactSheet-01.pdf) of minority groups are first-generation low-income. Furthermore, I would argue that students from FGLI backgrounds necessarily display great merit (even if it does not manifest on a resume) by pursuing their studies in spite of the obstacles that they face as a result of having fewer educational mentors and financial resources.   \n\n\nThird, companies such as Duolingo have also [experimented](https://blog.duolingo.com/diversity-at-duolingo-why-its-important-to-us-and-the-progress-weve-made/) with additional methods for increasing diversity among the intern pool. Specifically, Duolingo extended the application time period to later in the season, target schools with diverse computer-science student bodies or computer science organizations. Therefore, even if you do not support programs which explicitly consider status in a underrepresented racial/gender group, there are other hiring policies that appear to contribute to greater diversity in the computer science profession.",

            ">\nOne of the commenters under the thread mentioned that they weren\u2019t really a fan of jameslyonsswe because he seemed like he was just a diversity hire and didn\u2019t seem particularly talented.\n\nSo, this is all about perspective. From my POV, he very much still is a diversity hire, despite the fact that we can estimate him to be quite above average. Why is this? Simply put, there's a Princeton study that says being black is worth about 230 SAT points when it comes to college admission. The average black SAT at HYPSM is about 1340 while the average white SAT is about 1570. In percentiles, the average black SAT is 90th percentile and the average white is 99th percentile. So, if we consider these accomplishment to be Ivy League intelligence + hard work, and then factor in his advantage from being black, we can estimate that his IQ is about 120, i.e. 90th percentile, whereas a white person would have to have an IQ of over 138, 99%+, in order to achieve enough to be allowed to intern at NASA in high school and so on. While his achievements are impressive, I can predict that his intellectual output is only going to be in the 90th percentile, which actually could be surprisingly bad for a programmer. I'd like to see more data on what the average IQ of a programmer is, but I have seen that about 12% of the population can code to some degree, 2% do it full time, about 16% can do calculus, and a similar percent have some job that boils down to working with their brain. This makes sense, this is roughly everyone who is +1 SD IQ and it's a big reason why some many black people struggle with poverty. The economy priviliges intelligence. Anyway, we might venture to guess someone with a 120 IQ is going to be about average as a SWE. I found someone leaking some private data [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2ue71p/what_iq_do_you_need_in_order_to_be_a_programmer/co7m3ax/) more or less agreeing with this assessment, so yeah. We have other posts about how the bottom 20% of people who get hired are basically fakes or can't do fizzbuzz and I believe that --- especially in this economy with the diversity mandates we have. Statistically speaking it's highly probably that diversity hires are strongly overrepresented in that bottom 20% of programmers who basically harm codebases more than improving them. So what we have when we see this tiktoker is probably a rare example of a black programmer who isn't in that bottom 20%. In terms of white/asian programmers though, he's probably average, based on the statistics. Looking at his tik tok sort of confirms this for me, he just looks like another white \"midwit\" to me, with dark skin. I see a tiktok, YA, Python, leetcode, no sign of 140+ IQ genius like [here](https://www.gwern.net/) , [here](https://scottaaronson.blog/) , or [here.](https://kirkegaard.substack.com/) \n\n>\nI realized that if people on here are willing to dismiss jameslyonsswe as a diversity hire, it\u2019s a symptom of a much deeper issue of blatant racism and hatred. At this point you must just view all black people as inherently inferior in order to justify that mentality and I would just like to say in the most honest way possible that there is something deeply wrong with you. The black people in tech that you come across are not the problem, you are. You\u2019re a racist.\n\nIt's not about \"inherent inferiority.\" Black people are better than white people at running, football, basketball, etc. Does that mean I think white people are inherently inferior? Whites and Asians just happened to evolve to be better equipped to program computers, which happens to be economically in demand right now. The reason why people get upset over diversity hiring is because it discriminates against whites and Asians based, allegedly, on the false notion that evolution stopped at the neck. The job market is very hard for whites and Asians because they're always hired as a last resort after all of the minimally qualified blacks/hispanics/women/others are picked up. \n\nAnyway, the rest of your post seems to be pretty much filled with ignorance and hate for Asians and especially whites.",
