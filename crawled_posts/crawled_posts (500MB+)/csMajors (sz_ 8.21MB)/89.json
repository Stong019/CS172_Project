        "selftext": "Context: I recently finally got an internship at BofA. Both of my parents are Software Engineers, neither of 'em work at like these well known tech companies, and every day when I'm home is just endless, endless lecturing about how disappointed they are that I didn't get a job at Apple or Google or some other company. I'm not an amazing student but I managed to get some interviews at some respectable companies, Intel, SAS, Pendo, Cisco, etc. I recently got an offer then signed to BofA after like, 4 months of sending out applications every day, interviewing, doing coding practice, AND going to school fulltime. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy with how my career is coming together especially since I did an internship with Infosys earlier this year \ud83e\udd2e and was glad to just get ANYTHING, let alone a 130% increase in pay in a year, and the potential for a return offer at a company I would WANT to work for.\n\nAfter my initial praise, my mom went back to being just as annoying as she was before. You know when you're telling people about how annoying the job search is, how you send out hundreds of applications, or you get a notification for a position on LinkedIn and in like 6 hours there's like 200 applicants? And then they reply with something like \"oh, have you tried applying to <insert like the most selective consumer-facing company you can think of>\" believing they've offered genuinely useful advice? Or better yet \"have you tried connecting with recruiters on LinkedIn?\" That's what the ENTIRE last 4 months consisted of. Sometimes it'll be more or less hostile like \"what is it that the best students have that you don't? Why can't you get a job at these big companies?\" or \"Did you \\*really\\* apply to Facebook? show me the email confirmation.\" It is driving me insane how they'll go on rants for several hours about how when I was young they thought I'd end up being super wealthy and successful only to \"disappoint\" them with where I am now. If I told them \"if I worked at either of the companies you work at you wouldn't be happy\" which is true mind you, they'd throw a fit and consider it the height of disrespect/insolence. They constantly tell me they thought I was special and can't see why top companies don't want me, completely oblivious to the bias they're exhibiting toward their \\*son\\*. They got into the profession back when there wasn't really as much competition, and while they're paid decently theyI really am not loving the holidays right now and I'm just trying to be happy that I got something nice for summer while getting over the fact that nobody wanted me for spring :/ I'm happy with how I'm maturing into my career, and how I'm developing personally. I don't care if my parents don't see that or that they're kept up at night worrying that their son won't be a millionaire in his twenties, but it's annoying that I'm still dependent on them and while on break I'm beholden to this every day. I just wish they knew that with how irresponsibly they use their power in our relationship they are making it so that one day when I am wealthier I will not want to include them in my life at all.",

            "I was at a start up that was fairly small, but doing well. We interviewed a guy and gave him an offer, he was about in tears when he said he wanted to join but his mother is making him go to Google instead. A few months later we got acquired and it was very beneficial for all of us. One guy said that when he told his mom that we were getting acquired she responded with something like \u201cit\u2019s really fun that you are playing around with tech, but when are you going to go back to school to become a doctor?\u201d\n\nI think your mother has a lot in common with both of those that I mentioned",

            "Advice from a college dropout whose only internship was an IT role at a \u201cprestigious\u201d sporting venue that involved 5% writing code (network software update automation at that) that got unrealistically lucky and now works at FAANG:\n\n1. Zoom out. You are a good enough SWE to get a BOFA internship, you will have a good stable successful career if you stay on track. Your parents recognize the fact of maximizing the time you have now, and are trying to push you regardless of your current joy. I don\u2019t know them personally, but that means this will likely die out when they see you enjoying your internship and telling them all of the awesome work you do. If not, you will definitely be able to get a job good enough to afford moving out of your home, and then you won\u2019t have to hear it as much ;)\n\n2. Your path to working for those companies is much more clear after having an internship like this. This gives you experience and projects to speak on and allows you to focus more on what you may want to do going forward. This will help you pick a specific role to pursue if FAANG is your end target. Your parents would recognize this if they truly knew what it can require to get here.\n\n3. Again, just remember your parents are coming from a place of love and if anything they are just mad at themselves for not better preparing you for what they wanted for you. They feel like they didn\u2019t do a good enough job before so they are doing the rush procrastination special to try and get you to where they want you to be. That\u2019s a special love, but it is annoying and some parents can take it way too far. If FAANG isn\u2019t your target you should explain to them that you appreciate and value their advice but you have specific reasons why BOFA is where you want to go. If FAANG is it, then explain it\u2019s the stepping stone you need at the moment.\n\nFAANG advice: Hitting up recruiters can be nice but it\u2019s hard to determine what teams a recruiter is hiring for, at least in my experience. This for me has led to plenty of manager 1:1s but tougher interviews than I was ready for. Find a role you think is a good fit that you think you\u2019ll be passionate about, figure out who the hiring manager is (make a fake LinkedIn account to stalk, Google is your other friend), add them on LinkedIn and ask for a coffee chat to discuss the open role on their team.",
            "I understand it\u2019s frustrating. Parents always want the best things for us. But they always don\u2019t know the best way to express that. I think you should be open to them. Tell them how you feel, what\u2019s your plan, how you are happy about yourself, how it\u2019s negatively affecting your confidence etc. I think they will understand. But don\u2019t think of abandoning them when you can. Still they are the person who cares the most for you. Congrats on your internship. You have a bright future ahead.",
            "I have similar parents like this. It\u2019s important to keep in mind that they do have your best interests in mind but it\u2019s important for you to know that you have done more than enough already and BofA is more than prestigious enough. At the end of the day, you are working those hours not them. You are the one who put in the work to get hired, not them. We are proud that you have made it to a great internship , fellow CS major.",

But one thing to note is that jobs are declining at the moment, meaning interns who would have become juniors may stay as interns for longer periods, and the same thing all the way up. Many companies aren\u2019t promoting as much and aren\u2019t hiring as much. In a different version of 2020/2021 you may have rolled from your previous internship into something \u201cmore prestigious\u201d, but with less spaces available, you may have good enough, but there was no opportunity available.",

By the way they\u2019re treating you, it sounds like they\u2019re trying to live through you because they\u2019re wanting for you what they\u2019ve wanted for themselves\u2014 or they want to wave around that you work for one of those big companies out there. That sounds quite narcissistic to me \u2014 just the way you\u2019ve described their behavior (I don\u2019t know much about the situation but I\u2019m seeing this as face value since I\u2019m just reading what you\u2019ve wrote). It\u2019s your life, it\u2019s your career, and even if you don\u2019t get into a big company *now*, you certainly can later. They didn\u2019t make a ton of money when they first started, right? So why should they expect that from you? Climbing up the ladder is normal - you need to gain more experience to earn that expensive pay raise in most cases. \n\nRight now, it\u2019s the pandemic. Yes it\u2019s competitive right now, and it\u2019s harder to find a job at the moment, that\u2019s for sure! \n\nGetting an internship isn\u2019t easy, I\u2019ve been there. I had to settle for something somewhat close to my profession since I could barely find anything with my skill set (I\u2019m a web designer/ developer). I graduated almost two years ago and I\u2019ve had several jobs since then and I think I\u2019ve finally found the right fit. \n\nI know you can get through this, and I wish your parents would let you be.

A little goofy, but he had a good sense of humor and we hung out a few times. Didn\u2019t get any weirdo vibes from him at all, and figured we could become good friends. But then just because of so much goin on at orientation and him ending up in a different dorm, i only ever saw him in passing.  \n\nWhen I walked into my first CS class a couple quarters later, I saw him sitting there and I was stoked. So I sit down next to him and tell him how glad I am to see him there. For the first full week, we sat together and pretty much established that we were now homies in this class. Second week starts, I walk in and sit down, he walks in and sits next to me and suddenly it REEKS of vinegar. Like straight cum rag. I ended up holding my breathe half the class and figured maybe he just rubbed one out real quick before class and didn\u2019t have time to shower and it was like 100 degrees out (this was in SoCal) so he just had a little bit of cheese curdling or something so I figured it was a one off and that was probably aware of it and hella self conscious. But nope. This went on 3 or 4 more days in a row where the dude literally just smelled like a cum rag.  \n\nI couldn\u2019t take it anymore and one day just sat down at the front of the class. When he walked in, he saw me and asked why I was at the front, and I told him it was because I felt like I wasn\u2019t paying attention from where we were sitting so I wanted to be closer.  \n\nNext quarter, I meet up with another friend to get lunch and he goes, \u201cdude you won\u2019t believe this. This kid in my cs class I just got out of straight up smelled like jizz.\u201d And what do you know, he was in a class with my cum rag buddy.",

            "As a fellow electrical / electronics engineering grad, I can tell you that Python might be your issue. Hear me out.\n\nAs an electrical / electronics engineer we are taught about the deep deep crevasses of a computer (down to semiconductor physics / transistors and logic design). For me, that meant I had a very good understanding of computer memory, having programmed in Assembly and C. It also meant that I need to know the inner workings of something to really understand it. That's just how we are trained. You can apply a voltage to the terminals of a transistor, but what happens in that transistor? That's the level of detail we're used to.\n\nSo when I went to a dynamically typed interpreted language like Python, I just couldn't understand it because it was so far abstracted from the machine / metal. I was used to having to allocate and deallocate memory in C, having to be strict about what types I was using, among other things. Most people laugh, but Python and JavaScript are by far the two hardest languages I've learned because they are so far abstracted from the embedded systems level. Even if working with memory in C is super annoying, you know exactly what the computer is doing at any given moment.\n\nI found that Java was a much better language for me personally than Python. Although I didn't have to allocate and deallocate memory anymore (Java has garbage collection), I still had a statically typed language with strict types. I really enjoy writing and learning things in Java now, as opposed to Python because I can better understand what's happening beyond the code. \n\nThere's always the argument that Java is verbose and required a lot of code, but I honestly prefer it that way because everytime I type out a key word my brain registers exactly what's happening. \n\nFor example:\n\nSystem.out.println() \n\nMakes more sense to me from an object oriented approach than\n\nprint() \n\nIn Python.\n\nWhen we call print(), what is actually happening in the background? No idea. But when we use dot notation with System.out.println(), we can clearly see that a method is being called using dot notation.\n\nMaybe try switching to another technology before giving up. Once you learn the fundementals well, picking up other technology is easy.",

            "You are wrong . You just tried for 6 month. It took me years to become remotely decent. Take other 6 to 18 month and than see the results. In tech 6 months are nothing . You have to rethink the way you think. Good results come in time. Nobody became good in 6 month except for the genius people. For the rest of us it took a long time. The only friend of us is time and consistency. You don\u2019t become a good programmer by programming 6 month for 2 hours a day. You become a good programmer for building every day bit by bit for years . Give yourself some credit and go back to study and don\u2019t think about the others and how bad you are. Focus just on work and build up on that and the results will come.\n\nJust remember, for a baby to fully walk it takes up to 18 month and it is just a basic thing for us Humans. Studying something complex that it is not natural for our brain like programming math and science in general it will take time until our brain will start mapping the things in the right way. \n\nGo for it and push yourself for other 2 3 years man don\u2019t give up in life because it is hard. \n\nTake my example: At 15yo I moved to another country without speaking the language no friends no nothing. The only think I knew to say was Hi in the language of that country. And I had to start high school after 1 month of my arrival in that country. Well how did you think I felt ? I did not understand a think for 2 3 month in that country, people were laughing at me and everything. I felt the need to die in the first year but than I discovered the motivational speakers that saved my life and I understand that in order to get better I have to put my head down and work. By the time I finished the high school ( which I finished in time ) I was the second best out of my promotion on the entire IT department of that high school. Nobody was laughing anymore. Everyone was desperate to ask me for help so they could pass their exams . See In life it is like in a jungle. You have to fight for survival. Now this is your moment to fight. So FIGHT and DONT compare yourself with the others, everyone is different . It is like comparing different engines of different cars. Yes every engine does the same thing but in different ways. \n\nGood luck.",

And growth in the industry means big demand for your skill set. The psychology degree is fun, sure... but they can\u2019t do much related to that field without graduate school. And even then it\u2019s crazy competitive and doesn\u2019t pay as much on the whole.",
            "I was an economics major 4 years ago and thought it was hard as fuck and dropped out of college. Now here I am in junior level computer engineering classes and absolutely loving it and it seems way easier to me.\n\nI don\u2019t want to label you without knowing you but to be honest it sounds like it\u2019s a matter of interest not intellect in your case just as it was with mine.",
            "This isn\u2019t gonna sound reassuring but it\u2019s gonna get so much harder. \n\nmaybe drop a class or two. or evaluate if its a poor fit for you. or if its you think its worth the struggle",
            "My honest feedback is treat is like a full time job. I'm going back and getting a cs degree at the age of 28 after being in the workforce for 10 years. Studying 40-50 hours a week now and making good money after graduation is way better than getting an easy degree and struggling financially later. \n\nEither way it's gonna be hard. Face it head on and bite the bullet now if you can. I got an easy degree after high school and it was a total waste although I graduated with a near perfect gpa. \n\nHowever, you will need to be in a good place mentally to make this work. If your not, I'd put personal growth at the top of your list of priorities.",
            "I am a CS major, had a below average GPA and struggled in many courses, now I have ~7 years of work experience, made a lot of money along the way. One thing I would advise is that it is not important that you like each and every course, but there will be something you\u2019ll be good at. I sucked at algorithms, math and logic courses, but I fell in love with Operating Systems and Architecture, and ended up becoming a platform/systems engineer. If I had quit in year 1 (trust me I thought about it), I would have never discovered it. This major is the best bet to make you financially independent in a few years in the current market, put the work in and see if there is some aspect of CS you enjoy, you\u2019ll be able to find a role that matches your skillset.",
            "CSE major here, honestly I fucking hate school. I have since I was 5, I've changed my major before and hated really just about every second of every class my whole life, including general education courses. I've got about a year and a half left. Just stick with it. A lot of people are going to say things like \"well maybe it's just not for you\" or \"try to make the best of it\" but in reality, school just kind of sucks a lot of the time. It's not fun stressing about grades or tests or staying up until 3am to finish a piece of code or a paper. Just suffer through it for now, and keep your eye on the piece of paper with an inflated worth and the paychecks coming when you finish. You don't have to love school. You don't have to love work (who does? It's work). You will probably regret not finishing though.",
            "I remember I felt just like you during my first year: I wasn't really sure of the choice I made (CS was a \"last minute\" idea, it came out of nothing). The beginning was very difficult, I had never done anything CS related, wasn't able to write code, couldn't see the point in studying CS. I decided I didn't want to give up: I learnt to appreciate what I was studying, I found out a field I was interested in and I was finally able to get a BSc with a very high score.\nMy honest suggestion is to hold on until the end of the academic year, try to really find out if this difficult moment is just a bad first impression. It is never too late to choose another path anyway. If you ever happen to need support, just reach out in DM.\n\nEdit: Spelling",
            "One thing that helps: Don\u2019t overload yourself. I once took computational theory and calculus 2 concurrently plus a bunch of generals, and that was a really bad time. It\u2019s not always avoidable, but try and spread out your hard courses and do NOT rush through the major. Personally, I didn\u2019t graduate in 4 years and never planned on it as it would have required some insane semesters. I would recommend this path if you are feeling overwhelmed. It worked for me, though there were still rough times and it\u2019s not always the best route financially. \n\nAnd yes, you have more work than other majors. But do you really want to be in the position of a sociology or recreation management major upon graduation? What we are doing is (IMHO) so much cooler. \n\nIt\u2019s worth it. Trust me. You can do so much with this degree. And it gets more fun the higher up you get.\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to drop a course either. Or even withdraw. I had to withdraw from control theory this semester because I wasn\u2019t prepared for the insane proofs that class required. I had no idea what was going on lol. It\u2019s ok, you can take a hard class again in the future when you\u2019re feeling a little bit less overwhelmed and a little more prepared.",
            "Sounds like you\u2019d have a much better experience in a different major",
            "Is comp sci hard? Yes its harder than most majors. \nIs it worth it if you enjoy it? 100%\n\nLet me tell you something, don\u2019t stress about your grades. Thats the beauty of the program. Whereas for a lot of other majors, you need to memorize a lot of stuff, for computer science, you barely need any memorization. You just need to sit down and grasp your concepts firmly. All you need is a strong foundation and then it gets easier to build on top of it. Don\u2019t think of your assignments as assignments. Take them as challenges. Play them like a game. Get done whatever you can. When you get stuck, the community on SO and various other forums is super helpful (tho \u201csometimes\u201d a bit rude). If you try everything and still dont get a thing done, dont just leave it. Go talk to other people in your course, talk to the prof. Seek help. Find out what you were doing wrong. Ask to look at a solution or be walked through one. No one out there will care how good your grades were the one exception being grad school. All employers will care about is how well can you make something and how much experience do you have making stuff work. \n\nCoding abilities are just that: abilities. They get better the more you train and eventually you just start thinking a certain way. Again, ensure a strong foundation. \n\nAll that being said, what others have said definitely holds up. If you do not like solving problems. If you dont like sitting for hours just to hunt that one little nasty bug in your program then you should reevaluate your decision to do computer science. I\u2019m someone who is going through a lot of shit in my life to the point where I find it difficult to even do the bare minimum a person my age should be doing but the one thing that keeps me going is when I\u2019m working on a fun project. I spend hours of my day being productive and it doesn\u2019t feel like work and at the end of the day i\u2019m glad I was able to do something with my day to add value to it and helps me take my mind off from all the depressive shit life has thrown at me.",
            "Oh I 100% agree. When I started college in 2018 I originally wanted to do CS. Every school I applied to, I wanted to do CS. But I chickened out and spent two years being in a different major every semester, never trying CS. Then this school year, I finally decided to give it a go because my previous plans completely changed. I couldn\u2019t have picked a worse time to start in CS since everything is online. My mental health has been horrible being so isolated and dealing with difficult classes. I don\u2019t have any friends and things have been rough living with my parents. This semester is 100x worse than last semester. I have no motivation and I\u2019m already struggling with my two CS classes. We are only two weeks in and I have no clue how I\u2019m going to pass this semester. It\u2019s so hard to get the energy to really be productive when I just feel down. I can\u2019t drop out and I can\u2019t change majors anymore because I am already delaying my graduation by a year. Basically, something has to change or I won\u2019t be able to handle this semester. But I do enjoy CS when I\u2019m not extremely stressed, so there is a little bit of hope. So there is hope for you too!",
            "I had a very difficult time my first year. College is a hard transition for sure. But now I\u2019m in my third year and I am much more used to the workload. It won\u2019t get easier but I recommend sticking with it if CS is really something you\u2019re interested in. It\u2019ll be very rewarding despite the rigor.",
            "Oof yeah that was me before I switched. I was a data analytics major and there was an overload of software classes vs stats classes which made no sense. So I switched to something which I liked the classes more but still used coding. Think about maybe if you want to apply your coding skills to some other field. Like for me statistics and economics is more mathy, but still uses coding (data science is what I\u2019m interested in). For example, my friend was a comp sci major, hated it, and switched to biology and is now doing computational biology. If comp sci isnt ur thing maybe It\u2019s because of the nature of the degree itself, it\u2019s an \u201cengineering\u201d degree essentially so the software engineering part is what u may not like, not coding itself. Try and apply your coding skills to another field.",
            "If you're struggling this hard your first year I would seriously switch. The first year is pretty bare minimum.",
            "this major is hard af not gna lie. but if it makes you happy, keep pushing! you\u2019ll learn how to balance school, work and personal life! don\u2019t let the workload discourage you because at the end of the day, you enjoy coding! \n\nif you don\u2019t like this major then definitely switch to something you like. i know a lot of people who did CS for the money, but they ended up switching majors later on.",

            "Here's a question... are you sure you like / want to pursue CS? CS is difficult, but imo it's only hell or \"pure torture\" if you don't really care for it. As hard as it got in college with classes having me on the verge of tears I still loved what I studied at the end of the day, if you don't have the same you should reevaluate. It's not bad to do the major if you don't like it, I get it we all gotta make $$ somehow, but if you really feel this way it's gonna be a trade-off for you that you have to acknowledge. I think CS is one of the most brutal subjects if your hearts not in it because not everyone is built to sit in front of a screen for hours debugging.",
            "> I'm a first year.... \n\n\nOooooh baby. It gets worse. XD\n\nRight now you have two options (since you haven't invested too much yet and you're not as deep in the rabbit hole as the rest of us). \n\n1. You can quit and take up something that you actually enjoy. But this will require quite some sacrifices. \n\n2. You can bite the pillow and grind on with the rest of us. \n\nNot all of us like cs, and we'd definitely be lying if we said we aren't here for the massive paycheck at the end of this tunnel. \n\nBut we aren't here without sacrifices. I hate cs. It makes me rage that my friends in Econ do jack shit yet have stellar GPAs. I hate that I essentially sacrificed my social life in university because I was too scared to cheat on assignments and exams. I hate that I have to give up my sleep schedule for these insane classes\n\n\nFuck CS. I'm literally here for the money.",
            "There is a reason you can make 200k out of college with a cs degree",
            "Reading some of the comments here, people are heralding that CS is better than every non-STEM major and you will never not be on unemployment while a liberal arts major will keep you unemployed. Maybe it's cause those people are immature or aren't taking college seriously and should consider taking a break or going back when they feel ready to go back.\n\nI graduated with a Bachelors in the liberal arts and had a decent run in education, but I'm back in school and I'm now taking my current education in CS in a more mature manner than I used to in my previous education.\n\n I used to have lots of trouble having 2-3 classes and programming classes in the beginning, to where I just dropped out near the end due to being frustrated at the lack of support, having mediocre teachers, and I was falling behind. So basically I was sort in your shoes too, but now I feel a bit more confident in my programming skills, as long as I have Google and an understanding of a language.\n\nSo if you feel like you really can't do it, find another major you can see yourself doing and what you can apply it with in terms of a career or a job. Maybe go a community college instead to put off the pressure going to what I assume is a 4-year uni.",
            "Lol u surely haven't seen the course sequences for the engineering programs. They are much much harder than cs mainly cuz cs students get so many electives. Im in last year of SEG and by now im adjusted to the course load but other eng programs like CEG and ELG are even harder in my opinion with not much reward considering most of them end up doing cs or seg related jobs.",
            "what's wrong with some of you people, i'm so glad to be able to code. can you imagine doing anything else for homework? like punching in little logic puzzles for a grade and later for money is a dream come true. if you don't like it maybe do something else. you could be writing essay after essay for homework instead and i don't know about some of y'all but that sounds way less appealing.",

I have spent weeks working 60+ hour weeks when needed. \nHave you spent 60+ hours a week EVER studying/at classes/ building side projects and working internships combined? \nI have. \nMost people in my graduating class did. \n\nThink long and hard if you really want this I saw far too many friends go through 2 + years of CS just to realize they hate doing it or failing out and wrecking their GPA. \nI\u2019m not trying to discourage you I am trying to be real with you about the kind of person you may need to get disciplined and make yourself in to. \n\nGo compare yourself to Physics students or Electrical engineer students they will have similar work loads in a good school. And ones that go to school that don\u2019t push their engineering students hard have terrible job outlooks.",
            "Hate to break it to you, but CS is easy compared to a LOT of majors out there. Not necessarily easier in terms of skill and studying required, but let me offer you some perspective:  \n  \nWhen I first went to college, I was a tuba performance major. Every semester, I had to get written permission from the university to take more than 20 credit hours. Included in those 20-23 hours were about 5 ensembles that met 3 days a week, at one credit hour per ensemble. I'm not even kidding when I say that between gen ed/major reqs and ensembles, I was regularly at 10 \"classes\" or more every single semester. Now as a CS major, I have 4 classes with two labs, and an almost infinite amount of free time compared to my first time through school.  \n  \nThat said, if you genuinely are having a terrible time and hate what you're doing, it isn't going to get much better from here. Maybe consider taking a few different gen eds that sound interesting to you next semester and see if something lights a fire you didn't know about before.",
            "Change your major dude. If you\u2019re dying this hard in intro freshman classes it might not be the right fit. Choose a career that pays well AND that you enjoy my dude. Even if it pays a little less than CS.",

Sometimes I think a 4 year long bootcamp would be more stress free and useful for the field...but then again the things you learn in the gen eds are somewhat necessary for soft skills. That being said I don't know why CS is in the engineering department of my college. I get that \"Software Engineering\" blah blah but none of the Engineering courses are every targeted toward computer science and is seemingly extra bullshit to deal with.",

It makes things a little bit harder to compete with CS majors, but I'm having a much more chill college experience and basically the same career result.

Work on your time management skills, make a schedule and stick with it, try to focus when you're working, and don't check on other stuff during \"work\" hours.

I don't know if it's because it was because the curriculum was too hard for him or if he found out CS wasn't for him, though.  If you're at a really good school and are struggling, look into transferring to a more laid-back commuter school.  The education you'll receive will undoubtedly be inferior, but I always like to say \"you get what you put into it.\"  That is, no matter where you go to school, no matter how shit the CS program is, so long as you put in time outside of class to learn, you'll do fine like everyone else.\n\nI go to an unranked commuter school with a \"meh\" CS program, so I am quite biased.",

Google the last one. Ask and communicate evaluation metrics for internship and mention your goal of retuen offer in your 1st 1 on 1 with your manager. Do more than your project goals (you'll see what I mean).",

Congratulations!\n\nThis said, i caution you against saying that you\u2019re in a bad headspace prevents you from sending more apps. you are capable of so much! once you believe it, you achieve more. life is hard sometimes, seriously, but it doesn\u2019t change what has to be done. as soon as you realize this it will change your life like it did mine\n\nit\u2019s not too late to send out apps. if you know where to look, you could easily crank out 3/day in an hour. \n\nlet me emphasize- this is an important investment. i have friends smarter than me + with better grades who didn\u2019t do the work. now i\u2019m spending my summer making 80/hr as a junior in college while they flip burgers at mcdonald\u2019s. \n\nwork ethic and perseverance goes a long way- you are capable! you just have to believe it.\n\ngood luck, and congratulations on your offer \ud83d\ude4f",

It's a chance to develop something you will really need in your career -  the ability to learn quickly,  have a flexible mind and work well with people.\n\nI also grew up with really pressuring family, and what they think on this issue isn't really helpful for you, or relevant to the real world. Seriously, how would you get FAANG offers this year when FAANG companies are all laying off workers? I'm sure your parents mean well, but ignore them on this and be proud of yourself.\n\nThis is a tough time for young people looking for jobs in general, plus the rough year you've been having, good on you for overcoming that and finding an internship! Appreciate yourself and use the opportunity to its fullest.\n\nAlso, if it helps at all, from my experience, parents will come around. Maybe they just don't view you as a full adult yet and don't fully trust your decisions (my parents legit did not until I was like 30 and with a long-term partner). But, you don't need to prove anything to them. Ultimately you are responsible for your life. Try not to let it get you down. At the end of the day your parents care about you and when they see you succeed, they will be happy.",

MBAs don't know how to run a business like business-minded technical experts.",

Once you see that more jobs are getting added in the tech sector and hiring freezes have stopped, then you can give your full focus to job hunting.",

            "The best advice I can give isn't a magic bullet and probably not what you want to hear but I think this may be a critical moment you're all facing. I'm dating myself but I recall graduating from CS in to the aftermath of the 2000 tech bust. It wasn't a fun time to say the least. Your feeling hopeless gives me chills to remember those days and I'm seeing a lot of similarity to now. A few years prior had been glory days and as wide-eyed students we heard tales from those who got out before heading to silicon valley, big money, parties with open bar, ice sculptures, etc. By 2002 hanging on to those expectations had become delusional and dangerous. Those mates were all coming home and taking the few entry level jobs that were supposed to be ours.\r  \n\r  \nIt was very hard. Several classmates never got into the industry as a result. Others are still underemployed having done nothing but short & lame contracts ever since. Tech has more upside than I can list but this isn't the time anyway. Know the BIG downsides: it's cyclical with busts that are NASTY and losing career momentum in our industry can be devastating.\r  \n\r  \nkeep applying and interviewing\r  \n\r  \nkeep developing: writing code, github, certs, anything you can do/afford at whatever pace you can manage\r  \n\r  \nBe willing to relocate. They guys I know who got it the worst; never broke in, all also suffered from this one. Refusing to leave a shit small town and go to the city where there were some scraps to pick up. I don't mean in the sense of relocating for a specific offer which you don't have. I mean do it proactively NOW. Go to a big city, get a basement with 5 room mates, a job serving tables and pound pavement.\r  \n\r  \nnetwork. keep in touch with your classmates. know where people are going and what they're doing. this was how i got a job as an underpaid web developer\r  \n\r  \nlower your standards: take and hang-on to ANY gig remotely relevant to computing no matter how crappy the pay is. You can always keep looking and it's way easier to get a job when you already have one. You can advance quickly in tech and as the sun rises it'll come roaring back.. but you need to stay alive until then! You must keep a foothold or you'll end up like my old buddies. In this industry once you're out for even a couple years, you're basically starting over. That's when 99.9% just give up--I probably would too! My point is those in this situation actually gave up much earlier when they didn't do the things above.\r  \n\r  \nNot to scare you but you should understand the gravity of the situation if these layoffs continue for a while.. nevermind accelerate which they seem to have done just in the past few weeks (layoffs.fyi) Noobs will bear the most pain--it's just the way she goes. You need to persevere and keep your career intact. Remember the tech wreck wasn't a crash it was a punishing bear market that ground us down for several YEARS. This could easily only be the beginning. Again, lots of similarities then and now. I've got 20 years and I'm concerned. The good days are clearly over and it's time to get serious and hunker down. Been there before and there will be casualties!! Good luck!",
            "I graduated a coding bootcamp in Jan and landed my first SWE role probably a month before the layoffs started happening. It was for a small startup that was self funded and doing well per our CEO, who bragged about how good of a spot we were in and not to worry. Figured I was safe and was counting my blessings. Then i got laid off last month along with basically our whole engineering team, and with only 6 months of xp, I\u2019m pretty fucked. I feel your pain, we\u2019re doomed for a bit but it only takes one \ud83e\udee1",
            "There's a pattern of tech layoffs that's been occurring about every ten years (or less) since the early 90s, when there were enough tech workers that the layoffs became more apparent to everyone. As the decades rolled by and technology advanced more quickly, more and more tech jobs were added to the economy. However, since these are still specialized jobs that require skills not everyone has (or enough people have!), salaries rise over time, and companies lay off workers in the hopes that they can later hire desperate people back at lower salaries. And, it has always worked. \n\nSo, new grads, be warned: in about a year or so, there will suddenly be a lot of tech jobs back on the hiring boards. However, they will pay significantly less than what they have over the last few years. Companies will lowball you and overwork you because they expect you to be desperate. If enough of use refuse to take this kind of crap, they won't be able to keep doing it.",

The general \u201cAsian\u201d stereotype (which includes Indians). \n\nHe possibly just thought that you have your life path figured out and goals set clearly. He might have also thought that it\u2019s too ambitious, hence the use of the \u201cAsian answer\u201d stereotype, referring to how we have always been told to pursue bigger thing, have goals and work hard.",
            "I\u2019m Asian. My my mother was a classic tiger mom. \n\nThere were expectations, much of it resulting from culture. \n\nIn East Asia, greatly influenced by Confucian ideals. In China, class mobility was open for people capable of passing the Imperial Exams, much honor for the family. I remembered the primers schoolchildren learned Chinese characters from with stories about exactly that, how a young, promising lad would study hard. His parents sacrificed much so that he could have tutoring and focused on studying. And when he finally passed, his whole family were another social class alltogether. \n\nI don\u2019t know if India had something similar, but people there all want to pass the entrance exams to ITT so they can get prestigious jobs. \n\nBut you are working for a startup. It\u2019s risky. Some have the potential to make it big, and some do not. Some, for better or worse, make huge social impact. \n\nEvery single one of those big tech companies started as a scrappy startup. \n\nYour manager is not being discriminatory. He asking you in a way to see if you can see from beyond conditioned expectations. He\u2019s asking, if that is something _you_ really want, or it is something your culture and heritage wants you to do. There is also the implied question, do you see the startup as a stepping stone to a stable big tech career, or do you have an appetite for risk? What about being a founder? Don_you_ have a vision? And it\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t! Just make sure you examine your motivations and reasoning for your career.",

I agree that it\u2019s a little inappropriate, but I\u2019d say the friction of addressing it is not worth what is probably just a misunderstanding. I feel he was just making a comment on how Asians (like himself) have high expectations for themselves given the values held by our communities. \n\nIf a white person said that you\u2019d have an argument.

It's artificial, carefully crafted to appeal (lick up) to a corporation. \n\nWhen I applied for my current job, I talked about making products that impact and change millions of users' lives, and that I was very cosmopolitan and wanted to work abroad. What they don't know is that I want to work my way to a green card, marry someone, live financially free off of my stock portfolio, possibly enlist in the military, and then work only because I want to.
