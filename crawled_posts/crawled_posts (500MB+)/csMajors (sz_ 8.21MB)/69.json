You\u2019re only a sophomore, you still have 2 years of school left to improve your coding skills. \n\nThe best advice I have is to just work on projects and learn from those projects outside of classes, I went from not being able to build a to-do app too to making a full fledged music streaming application by myself in under a month just from grinding on that project and googling and reading documentation (although it was winter break so I had almost 8 hours a day to learn and build the project), but the point is if you have the motivation and the time, you\u2019ll 100% be able to improve a lot by the time you graduate",

That being said I spent probably 14+ hours a day on school studying some semesters to get a 4.0 (including class time), took at many jobs with any relatable experience that I could, slept 3-6 hours a day, and was not a person trying act like I\u2019m smarter than other people (seems to be a common behavior of some people in the field) and therefore was likable enough to be given references. I got a job, but it is not one of the crazy salaries people listed, still much better than I could be making in other professions. I think coding based jobs are just no longer going to have crazy pay like in the past. People probably won\u2019t instantly get a job out of college but probably find one in the year after so they\u2019ll have to be prepared to do some factory work or fast food work while applying. In sum, if people don\u2019t like the profession, they probably will fail or will be miserable trying to get a job. If they do like it, then they need to focus on the steps they are able to achieve and appreciate them while keeping their eyes open for opportunities that pop up. \nThis doesn\u2019t take away how incredibly stressful the market is and the recent change in the profession. So my suggestion is find things that bring you joy to distract you from the stress, make sure you have some form of income from any job so that you are not desperate during interviews, don\u2019t pick up industry jobs that you can tell are going to make you miserable & burn you out, and don\u2019t worry about all this work people are doing for free like leetcode unless if you really feel like it brings you value.",

Feeling stuck is a normal part of the learning process, and it doesn't mean you're \"fucked.\" Here are a few things to consider:\n\n\nTake a Break: Sometimes, stepping away from a problem for a little while can help clear your mind and approach it with a fresh perspective when you come back.\n\n\nBreak it Down: Break down your goals into smaller, more manageable tasks. Start with simpler projects or exercises to build your confidence gradually.\n\n\nSeek Help: Don't hesitate to ask for help from peers, professors, or online communities. There are plenty of resources available, from forums like Stack Overflow to online courses and tutorials.\n\n\nPractice Patience: Learning takes time and patience. It's okay to struggle and make mistakes along the way. What's important is that you keep trying and learning from those experiences.\n\n\nFocus on Progress: Celebrate your small victories and progress, no matter how incremental. Each step forward is a step closer to your goals.\n\n\nExplore Different Resources: If one learning method isn't working for you, try another. There are many different approaches to learning ML/AI and programming, so explore what works best for you.\n\n\nRemember, it's okay to feel frustrated and discouraged at times, but don't let those feelings define your journey. Keep pushing forward, and you'll get there eventually.\u00a0",
            "Disconnect the code from the programming. Code is a whole separate thing; it\u2019s secondary. When you have difficulty solving a problem, it\u2019s likely rarely because of a language issue, where you can\u2019t come up with the code to solve it; you\u2019re just not solving the problem before writing the code. If your first response to a leetcode problem is to just start hammering away at the keyboard, that\u2019s probably a big part of where you\u2019re going wrong.\n\nA lot of leetcode problems can be solved with one or two decks of playing cards. Get two decks with different backs, because it makes them easier to separate when you\u2019re done. Two decks means you can simulate up to a hundred or so elements, and you can deal with duplicate data. Once you really understand what\u2019s going on, with how your eyes and hands work as iterations of loops, you can structure the solution like a flowchart (god, I wish they taught flowcharting at more schools), and then you eventually just go, \u201cHuh,\u201d and type out the code like it was nothing. This is part of the reason I bounced over to playing with CNC machines and robots; when I flowcharted the program, I had effectively written the program, and the coding part just bored the shit out of me.\n\nReason why I\u2019m the high priest of a local flowcharting cult is because if you flowchart a program, you can write that code out in any language you know. There\u2019s no more problem solving to be done. I was out at my old community college, pushing the CompSci and Engineering Tech majors at my university, and my Yoda threw a random leetcode problem at me, so I just grabbed a marker and flowed out the problem on the whiteboard. Some kid in the back of the room says it doesn\u2019t count, because I didn\u2019t write the code, and I asked, \u201cDo you want that in C, C++, C#, Python, Swift, or Java? I don\u2019t care what language you tell me, because I\u2019m just going to write out the code that matches this chart.\u201d And then my Yoda told me (once again) that I was throwing my life away to play with robots instead of writing software.\n\nI think that what you really need is a philosophy. Mine is one of patience and solving the problem, which I gained after looking long into the abyss and seeing nothing but registers, accumulators, comparators, and Booleans, and anything else is abstraction. At that point, I could really feel the execution, and it made me better at solving a problem on the computer\u2019s level. Because there\u2019s nothing magic about code. Code doesn\u2019t exist for the computer\u2019s benefit; it exists for *yours*. And that\u2019s why I think writing code is boring, because by the time I start writing it, I\u2019m already done with the hard part.",

If you're in your sophomore year of your undergraduate degree you need to be focused on understanding the basics of programming. You can take upper level courses on AI and Machine Learning , if you have a passion for it, but I have never heard of anyone hiring a bachelor's degree fresh out college to a position of any consequence in AI/ML. I'm sure there's an exception to the rule. I'm sure someone here will tell you the opposite. I can only say, I've never seen it. For the most part, I expect very little from people fresh out of college who don't have any serious internships or portfolio projects. \n\nIf your goal is to simply get \"a job\", focus on the basics. Build simple applications. Apply for internships that give you actual coding experience. You will get a job. Your first job will likely not be your ideal job, but you can try to find an entry level role at a company doing some ML/AI stuff and try to get on those teams. Get a company to sponsor your masters degree. Study ML/AI there, contribute to open source, attend conferences, meet other people in the field. From there start applying to the jobs you really want. \n\nThis subreddit is very disconnected from the reality of the industry.",

I couldn\u2019t leetcode for shit for like a year after I started doing it. Just do the dailies Monday-Friday. Try to solve the problem yourself or with friends for 30 minutes. If u can\u2019t solve the problem,  then go through solutions, try and implement them. Do that for a year and you will get better, promise.\n\nLeetcode aside, for projects/AI/ML, it helps getting involved in stuff through school. My school lets students get involved with AI research and there\u2019s even a course put together by a club for that research. We also had clubs that put people together to work on projects, get advice, etc. I won\u2019t assume your school will have same stuff, but look out for those \u201cgroups\u201d so u can always have ppl to ask questions and learn from. If you can\u2019t find them, remember that your professors are valuable. It doesn\u2019t hurt attending office hours to ask questions abt things like AI/ML or full stack development even if not in the scope of the class.\n\nLastly though, you just have to do a project. It sounds so simple, but picking a project, learning the required stuff, and doing it isn\u2019t easy the first time around. The project can be a simple weather app, checkers, a card game, etc. Just something that lets you practice ur skills. Doing that will help you leaps and bounds in actual learning and proficiency. \n\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019ll tell you to do NOW:\n\nStart doing leetcode daily problems today\nTake time to decide on a project the next couple of days. Start it by next Monday. It might be a \u201cmonth before sophomore year ends,\u201d but next year is junior year. After the summer if you have at least a project and get better at leetcode, you will have a better chance of getting an internship (junior year summer is huge), and learning more from there",

It'll probably get buried, but here's my advice, anyway:\n\nIt's not just about coding.  Is the ability to read and generate code important?  Sure.  But not all CS careers are locked into code.  My current goal is Network Engineering.  I know I'll need to develop some coding skills (relearning C++ after a 15 year hiatus is *hard* - going to be riding the struggle bus all the way to graduation) and learn some scripting, but the bulk of my focus is going to be on network topography and security.\n\nIf parts of the major don't mesh well with your thinking style, find the parts that work well with you and focus on those.  Security, networking, and Enterprise IT can all draw from the CS pool.",

People here are discouraging you on purpose for their own gain. Just keep rolling with it and things will click. It takes time and experience. Eventually the puzzle pieces fit together and you'll develop a skillset that allows you to plow through trivial work (like todo apps) and approach big problems without fear.\n\nStep away from AI for a bit. That shit isn't easy, especially at your level. Revisit it later.\n\nFor now, focus on fundamentals. Pick something easy and useful to build *for yourself*, then go and do it. That is by far the best way to learn. For example, I made a shitty little bot for a video game. I didn't know what I was doing when I started it. Had little confidence. Today it has hundreds of users and got me two jobs before I was ever asked to touch Leetcode.\n\n---\n\nTLDR: Stop reading this sub, keep going if you like solving problems, build something for yourself (or a friend) that is useful whether you think you can or not, reap the benefits.\n\nTLDR++: Fuck Leetcode.

A rough time to graduate, the dot com bubble had just burst and the company I had interned with (Nortel) was about to go bankrupt and was not hiring anybody.\n\nWhat is the solution? Get an internship the summer before your final year of university. Or even take a gap year and get an internship. The expectations for an intern are considerably lower than those for an entry level full time position.  During an internship you will learn to code, learn how to ask for help, learn how to read documentation, learn how to interact in a professional meeting environment.  Its invaluable.\n\nI tend to think there are two types of people who take a CS degree, those who love computers, they have programmed as a hobby for years before going to university and there are those who think it will be a well paying career.

This is one of the easier entry level classes too. I offered to help some of my other classmates with homework and these guys had no idea what they were doing and they did not seem interested in it. \n\nSo yea I agree there\u2019s a lot of people going into CS but majority of these people are only doing it because they don\u2019t know what else to do and they see tech workers making all this money on social media.",

            "I will tell you my story, when I was in college taking my programming 1 class back in 2017, on first day, there were \\~85 students (went to a public uni in FL). These 85 kids were mostly White, Indian (including me) and Asian men but still 20-35% women and other POCs.\n\nAfter our midterm exam and drop-out deadline, around 40-50 students dropped the class, leaving it to be overwhelmingly Indian, White and Asian men with 4-5 women and rest other POCs.\n\nThe point is, tech is ALWAYS be saturated at entry-level since the thought of six figures would turn on any human being but when you struggle and don't like/understand basics, you leave it.\n\nWhich is why positions from mid to high level are so lucrative with high salaries but entry-level ones are saturated. So, don't worry about this. Most people end up leaving tech in initial stages, leaving the more resilient ones to reap the perks. Don't stress out, focus on being the best or at least better than what you were yesterday :)\n\nEdit:\n\nI might add :- after programming 2, programming 3, data structures, computer networks, computer architecture classes, there used to be around 10-15 students in a class towards my last semester. So, from almost 90 went down to 15-20... huge drop.",
            "I am not worried about it. Those tiktoks show how easy it is to get a job as a software engineer just to get people to buy some magical courses that's suppose to land them a CS job. In reality, CS and Software Engineering jobs are very difficult which is why they pay more. Whoever is going in with the expectation to earn some easy bucks are about to get humbled soon. Some lucky folks might end up getting those FAANG jobs just by leetcoding a few months but other than that it requires real dedication and hardwork to be able to survive in this industry. Not everyone has what it takes to survive 4yrs in CS - trust me I have seen a lot of peers drop out because their expectation didn't match reality. What people also don't realize is that the degree isn't going to speak for them during the interviews - they will be on their own and what they decided to do with that degree. The bar to enter the market as a software engineer is lower than ever already (degree or no-degree) but if you want those high paying jobs, you will always have to earn them through the hard way.",

I probably applied to aprox. 200 companies for new grad in the month of September.\n\nHere are some notable rejections:\n\n**Failed after OA:**\n\nIBM 9/16\n\nStripe 9/16\n\nOcient 9/16\n\nExpedia 9/26\n\nBetter 9/26\n\nGoogle 9/26\n\nRedfin 10/7\n\n**Failed after phone:**\n\nFacebook 10/11\n\nBloomberg: 10/25\n\nOracle\n\n**Failed after final:**\n\nAmazon 11/26\n\nQualtrics 11/15\n\n**Offers:**\n\nJPMorgan 130k NYC (switch to another location) Accepted\n\nDell 86k Austin\n\nGM 100k Detroit\n\nChevron 100k Houston\n\nProgressive 75k Remote\n\nCaterpillar 90k Chicago\n\nFord 90k Detroit\n\nWells Fargo 74k Raleigh\n\nFirst thing to note is that Microsoft (or probably any FAANG) on resume got me responses from just about every company. There were countless ghosts and rejections not shown here but I got a good shot at almost all big tech companies (except Apple which always ghosts me).\n\nIf you notice, I only got offers from companies that have fully behavioral interview loops. Yes Chevron and JPMorgan asked technical questions but they were LC super easy (Fibonacci question for example). The good news about this is my STAR responses really work. The bad news is I could not meet the bar in my LeetCode style technical interviews.\n\nI started the recruiting season after my Microsoft rejection with 81 LeetCode solved. About 60 Easy, 21 Medium. From September to now I completed 46 problems for a current total of 127 (63 E / 57 M / 7 H).\n\nClearly this amount wasn\u2019t enough. I bombed basically every DS&A interview round except the one for JPMC where they asked me to count the occurrences of nums in an array\u2026\n\nMy strategy for the last 3 months was to fully complete and internalize this even more consolidated version of the B75 list written by the original B75 creator. It is 50 questions instead of 75:\n\n[https://techinterviewhandbook.org/best-practice-questions/](https://techinterviewhandbook.org/best-practice-questions/)\n\nThis list opened my eyes to Tries, Heaps, and a bunch of other crucial LeetCode patterns I had not known.\n\nAt my current level of preparation, I feel that I have seen each LC pattern at least once and know about each data structure. However, I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve mastered any one topic. If there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned about LC (at least for myself) its that time and practice are the only thing that will help me improve. Some people crack G with >50 LC solved, and I can not even understand how. This process is a painful slog and there is no way around it. I will be grinding this until I crack FAANG again and it may suck the entire time, but I will do it.\n\nI'm excited to start at JPMorgan next year and explore a new city. Along side my new job Ill continue to interview prep for next years recruiting season. I\u2019m hoping to apply to all the same companies again when my cooldowns come up and I can interview as a new grad around August 2022. Hopefully by then I\u2019ll have hundreds of LC solved and be ready to give it another shot.\n\nPlease ask away if you have any questions or advice",
