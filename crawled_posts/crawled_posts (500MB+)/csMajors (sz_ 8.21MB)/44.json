        "selftext": "* International Student (Will be graduating this summer. May '24)\n* Had 2 years of exp before coming for Masters.\n\n\u00a0The whole process took \\~3 months\n\n**How did I apply?**\n\n* Searched for the keyword \"meta is hiring\" on LinkedIn, where I found a post from a recruiter. Fortunately she mentioned her email in the post. I then mailed her and got a call the very next day.\n\n**Why did the recruiter even reply to my email?**\n\n* I suppose the timing worked out perfectly. Meta had just begun hiring for E4 roles, and I might have been among the few who stumbled upon her LinkedIn post (which had only 7-8 likes). Since not many people reached out to her yet, she probably noticed my email.\n\n**Tips :**\n\n* Avoid commenting \"Interested\" on posts that already has tons of comments. Instead, focus on finding posts that haven't gained much attention yet.\n* Seriously, don't comment 'Interested' . It's of no use.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Interview format (E4 level)**\n\n* 1 Tech screen : 2 LC Medium/Hard questions.\n\nYou'll only be invited to the virtual on-site after passing the tech screening\n\nVirtual On-site\n\n* 1st round : Coding ( 2 LC Medium/Hard questions in 45 min )\n* 2nd round : Coding ( 2 LC Medium/Hard questions in 45 min)\n* 3rd round : System design\n* 4th round : Behavioral round\n\nFinally, team matching process. Team matching may take longer for general applications, up to a month, but for specific skill set roles, it's usually faster.\n\n**How long did it take for my team matching?**\n\n\n* I didn't have to go through team matching. Surprisingly, while I was in the process of interviews, an engineering manager from Meta reached out to me through LinkedIn and he had no idea that I was already in the interview loop. We had a call after he reviewed my resume. I got team matched even before the interviews.\n\n**Tips :**\n\n* Trees and Graphs are must. You ll get at least one question on this.\n* Meta doesn't ask DP\n* Solve last 6 months meta tagged leetcode questions. But you never know. One of the coding questions I got was completely new. No concept like bfs, dp etc involved. Logic based.\n* You are not allowed to execute your code in the interviews.\n* During the coding interviews, it's really important to come up with the best answers for each question they give you. If you can't solve one or provide the most optimized solution, it's going to hurt your chances of securing an offer.\n\n**Tips for behavioral round :**\n\n* Follow STAR method strictly.\n* Mention some impactful and quantifiable work. ( Ex: Introduced an optimized scheduling system, leading to a 20% decrease in administrative workload, saving approximately $10,000 in operational costs annually. More elaborative though )\n* These are some great tips from a former staff engineer at Meta : [https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/179j96a/behavioral\\_interviews\\_matter\\_too/](https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/179j96a/behavioral_interviews_matter_too/)\n* There's also a whole blog from the same person : [https://www.hellointerview.com/blog/story-crafting-101?utm\\_source=reddit&utm\\_medium=social&utm\\_campaign=story-builder](https://www.hellointerview.com/blog/story-crafting-101?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=story-builder)\n\n* Prepare for answers to general behavioral questions beforehand. Make sure you have atleast 2 answers for each question. (I panicked and mistakenly used a different answer to a question but was still relevant. Therefore it's always better to have at least 2 answers for each question)\n* If you have 0 work exp, mention your projects and internship experience.\n\n**System design** :\n\n* The only guide you will ever need for system design : [https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer)\n\nResume template I used :[https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/resume-template-by-anubhav/dhmkrwtksdgy](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/resume-template-by-anubhav/dhmkrwtksdgy)\u00a0\n\nI'll continue updating this post with more points as they come to mind.

The more resumes we get the more data we have to train on great, good, mid, poor, and horrible resumes for the talent that should get the job and those that should not get the job.\n\nSo do not just slam your resume to places, but look at the job, do a full self-assessment of your actual capabilities and only if you would potentially do at least a good job apply.  Anything less, and you should move on.  This will reduce your stress, give you higher response rates and get you into a job that you might actually be a good fit for.",

IT job literally said I was a top pick but because of the degree they're going to move with someone else because they don't want to train me up just to leave later in the year. I legitimately am thinking of just not mentioning the degree anymore but idk how tf I explain all the gaps I've had the last six years.",
